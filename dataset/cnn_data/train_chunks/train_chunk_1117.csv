"An Ohio inmate put to death for murder was tortured by his unusually slow execution, the man's daughter said on Friday, as she announced plans to file a lawsuit over her father's death. Dennis McGuire's daughter, Amber, referred to the 'agony and terror' of watching her father as he appeared to gasp in his final moments on Thursday, during a previously untried execution method. 'It was the most awful moment in my life to witness my dad's execution,' she said. 'I can't think of any other way to describe it than torture.' Ohio could face a number of legal challenges over the method. Scroll down for video . Execution: Death row inmate Dennis McGuire, pictured, became the first prisoner executed in the U.S. by the two-drug combination. His family are now suing, saying he was 'tortured' during the execution . Upset: Amber McGuire, left, recounts the execution of her father, Dennis McGuire, as her sister-in-law Missie McGuire cries at a news conference on Friday. 'I can't think of any other way to describe it than torture,' Amber said . The execution violated Dennis . McGuire's constitutional right not to be treated or punished in a cruel . or unusual way, said defense attorney Jon Paul Rion, representing . McGuire's adult children. McGuire's attorney Allen Bohnert called the killer's death 'a failed, agonizing experiment.' He added: 'The people of the state of Ohio should be appalled at what was done here today in their names.' McGuire, 53, was put to death for the 1989 rape and fatal stabbing of a pregnant newlywed, Joy Stewart. He made loud snorting noises . during one of the longest executions since Ohio resumed capital . punishment in 1999. Nearly 25 minutes passed between the time the lethal . drugs began flowing and McGuire was pronounced dead at 10:53 a.m. This is the longest execution in Ohio since the state resumed capital punishment 15 years ago, records show. The next-longest execution was the 22 minutes it took killer Reginald Brooks to die in 2011, according to an AP analysis of the timelines of the 53 Ohio executions since 1999. Brooks received a lethal dose of a different drug. During the execution he opened and shut his hands as if waving to his son, . daughter and daughter-in-law sitting a few feet away and a full minute . later he stood up and told them, 'I love you, I love you.' Anger: Missie McGuire, left, listens to her husband, Dennis McGuire, at a news conference on Friday in Dayton, Ohio, where they announced their planned lawsuit over the unusually slow execution of his father, also named Dennis McGuire . Experimental: McGuire was executed at this facility by Ohio's untested execution method . Punishment: The death chamber at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville. Ohio used intravenous doses of two drugs, midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a painkiller, to put McGuire to death . Ohio has begun using lethal doses of the sedative midazolam and the painkiller hydropmorphone after the European manufacturer of the previous drug, pentobarbital, stopped allowing its use in lethal injections. Marketed in English-speaking countries and Mexico under the trade names Dormicum, Hypnovel, and Versed, midazolam is a short-acting sedative in the benzodiazepine class of drugs developed by Hoffmann-La Roche in the 1970s. The drug is used for treatment of acute seizures, moderate to severe insomnia, and for inducing sedation and amnesia before medical procedures. It possesses profoundly potent anxiolytic, amnestic, hypnotic, anticonvulsant, skeletal muscle relaxant, and sedative properties. Hydromorphone is a very potent centrally acting analgesic drug of the opioid class. It is a derivative of morphine. An expert in Dennis McGuire's case claimed the two drugs together in lethal doses would very likely cause what's known as 'air hunger' or simply an acute shortness of breath. The clinical definition of air hunger or dyspnea is an uncomfortable awareness of one's breathing effort. It is a normal symptom of heavy exertion but becomes pathological if it occurs in unexpected situations. Reports from McGuire's death chamber suggest this may have in fact occurred. As such, the appropriateness of the drugs, and the extent to which they may be cruel, will likely be reviewed by Ohio officials before they are used in another execution. McGuire was then still for five minutes before . emitting a loud snort as if snoring and continued to make this noise for . several minutes. His stomach rose and fell several times as . he repeatedly opened and shut his mouth, making what the Columbus Dispatch described as 'deep, rattling sounds.' His family sobbed as they watched him slowly die. 'Oh, my God,' Amber McGuire, said as she watched his final moments. A . coughing sound was Dennis McGuire's last apparent movement, at 10:43 . a.m. He was pronounced dead 10 minutes later. McGuire as first injected . with the drugs at 10:29 a.m. The convicted murderer's attorneys had . argued against using intravenous doses . of the sedative midazolam and the painkiller hydromorphone, claiming . the combination would cause 'air hunger.' This medical phenomenon describes where someone experiences . immense terror and agony as they strain for breath during the execution. The new method was adopted after supplies of . a previously used drug dried up because the manufacturer declared it . off limits for capital punishment. McGuire's . snorts and gasps, and prolonged death, suggest he may have indeed . suffered 'air hunger' and could prompt Ohio officials to . review using the drug cocktail. Executions under the old method were typically much shorter and did not cause the kind of sounds McGuire made. What was particularly unusual Thursday . was the five minutes or so that McGuire lay motionless on the gurney . after the drugs began flowing, followed by a sudden snort and then more . than 10 minutes of irregular breathing and gasping. Normally, movement . comes at the beginning and is followed by inactivity. It's . almost certain lawyers will use McGuire's execution to challenge Ohio's . plans to put a condemned Cleveland-area killer to death in March. A . few minutes before McGuire was put to death, Ohio prison director Gary . Mohr said he believed the state's planning would produce 'a humane, . dignified execution' consistent with the law. Victim: McGuire, 53, was sentenced to die for the 1989 rape and fatal stabbing of Joy Stewart in Preble County in western Ohio. The 22-year-old Stewart was newly married and pregnant . Ohio prisons spokeswoman JoEllen Smith had no comment on how the execution went but said a review will be conducted as usual. McGuire's . attorney called on Republican Gov. John Kasich to impose a moratorium . on future executions, as did a state death penalty opponent group. The . move will likely echo across the country as other states contemplate . new drug methods, said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death . Penalty Information Center, which opposes capital punishment. 'Judges . will now realize that the warnings being raised about these untried . procedures are not just false alarms,' he said in an email. 'States will now have more of a burden to show that they are using a well thought out best practice. ' In . pressing for the execution to go ahead, state Assistant Attorney . General Thomas Madden had argued that while the U.S. Constitution bans . cruel and unusual punishment, 'you're not entitled to a pain-free . execution.' U.S. District . Judge Gregory Frost sided with the state. But at the request of . McGuire's lawyers, he ordered officials to photograph and preserve the . drug vials, packaging and syringes. McGuire, . strapped to a gurney in the death chamber, thanked Stewart's family . members, who witnessed the execution, for their 'kind words' in a letter . he apparently received from them. Crime scene: The pregnant 22-year-old was found dead in a dark wood, pictured, in 1989 . Tragic: In the letter Joy's sister wrote, she described her 10-years-younger, adopted sister as the light of her family's life . 'I'm going to heaven. I'll see you there when you come,' he said. Stewart's . slaying went unsolved for 10 months until McGuire, jailed on an . unrelated assault and hoping to improve his legal situation, told . investigators he had information about the death. His attempts to pin the crime on his brother-in-law quickly unraveled, and he was accused of the killing. More . than a decade later, DNA evidence confirmed McGuire's guilt, and he . acknowledged his responsibility in a letter to Kasich last month. The . death row inmate's lawyers argued McGuire was mentally, physically and . sexually abused as a child and had impaired brain function that made him . prone to act impulsively. 'We . have forgiven him, but that does not negate the need for him to pay for . his actions,' Stewart's family said in a statement after the execution.","Convicted killer Dennis McGuire, 53, took 25 minutes to die - the longest ever execution since Ohio resumed capital punishment in 1999 .

"Jose Mourinho has lashed out again at the Football Association and Sky Sports, accusing them of operating with double standards in pursuit of violent conduct charges against players. Mourinho demanded to know why the rules which applied to Diego Costa did not apply to other players in the Barclays Premier League. He did not mention Robin van Persie but he was talking about the Manchester United striker, who escaped a violent conduct charge after he appeared to throw an elbow into James Tomkins' face during a 1-1 draw at West Ham on Sunday. VIDEO Scroll down for Jose Mourinho: Van Persie should be banned for elbow on Tomkins . Jose Mourinho makes an elbow gesture as he discusses why Robin Van Persie should have face retrospective action for his elbow on James Tomkins . Manchester United striker Van Persie catches Tomkins in the face during the 1-1 draw against West Ham . Tomkins complained after the match that he thought Van Persie's challenge was malicious . The West Ham defender turns away holding his head after the challenge with Van Persie . The Chelsea boss mimed an elbow and said: 'A player did this in the face of somebody else and nothing happened. The same thing happened last season when Ramires was suspended and one week later a Man City player kicked a player at Norwich, who was on the floor and nothing happened. I'm used to it.' Ramires was banned for four games last April when cameras caught an off-the-ball elbow on Seb Larsson. It was missed at the time but treated as his second red card of the season. Michael Oliver was the referee in charge of Chelsea's Capital One Cup semi-final against Liverpool, after which Costa was banned for three games for stamping on Emre Can. Oliver told the FA that he had not seen the Costa stamp, opening the door to a disciplinary charge. At West Ham, referee Mark Clattenburg awarded a free-kick, indicating he had seen the clash, but did not show Van Persie any card. Mourinho explained that he 'needed time to understand' why Diego Costa was given a three-match ban . Chelsea striker Diego Costa (right) moves towards the ball after Emre Can takes a tumble off the pitch . As they were in different competitions, there is a slightly different disciplinary process. The Football League operate by the 'old' system which allows referees to look at a situation again, while the Premier League is led by a three-man panel of ex-referees who step in if they believe the officials have missed something, after reading the referee's report of the game. 'The same people who suspended my player didn't want to suspend a player this weekend,' said Mourinho. 'A player could have been suspended this weekend and he wasn't. I am still processing that information.' Costa (right) sits next to Cesc Fabregas at Stamford Bridge after being banned for three matches . Speaking of the incident, Hammers boss Sam Allardyce said this morning: 'From a challenge point of view I thought it was pretty naughty. He (Van Persie) had a look to see where the defender was and then took him out basically. 'The assistant referee gave a foul but he didn't think it was more serious. Tomkins should be fit to play tomorrow night which is the most important thing for us.' Mourinho also shed more light on why he had decided to shun the media following Costa's three-match ban. Romelu Lukaku (left) was sold by Mourinho after failing to make an impact at Stamford Bridge . He said: 'I'm fine. I was in a good mood. I needed more time to forget why my player was suspended. 'I needed more time to understand why some are punished and others aren't.' The Everton contest on Wednesday night sees the return of Romelu Lukaku to Stamford Bridge after the Belgium forward struggled to break through into Mourinho's plans and was allowed to leave the club. The Portuguese manager said: 'He proves every weekend that he's a good player. Nobody has doubts at Chelsea that he's a good player. Lukaku has scored 10 goals so far this season for Roberto Martinez's side . 'We know Romelu is a good player. (Andre) Schurrle is a good player, (Kevin) de Bruyne is a good player, (Juan) Mata is a good player. 'They are good. We don't sell garbage. We sell top players. 'We sell top players, we get top fees. (Without) top fees we don't sell them, we keep them. 'That's football, that's life, that's market. The player wishes sometimes to be in clubs where they become clearly the first option. That's football, that's life. 'If he's happy, that's good. He wanted to play all the time.'","Jose Mourinho believes Man Utd star Robin van Persie should have faced retrospective action for elbow on James Tomkins .

"After a 2-1 north London derby day victory against Arsenal on Saturday, Tottenham fans are understandably starting to imagine their team finishing inside the Premier League's top four. With a Premier League clash against Liverpool to come on Tuesday night, those same fans will be hoping that Spurs can lay down a marker at Anfield that suggests their team are serious contenders for fourth spot. However, Tottenham's next opponents have become somewhat of a bogey team, with Liverpool winning the last three Premier League meetings and racking up an 12-0 aggregate scoreline. Harry Kane (left) celebrates scoring Tottenham's second goal against Arsenal on Saturday . Liverpool have become a bogey team for Totteham and beat them 3-0 at White Hart Lane last summer . The biggest aggregate scorelines between current Premier League teams after their last three meetings... Man City vs Spurs: 15-2 . Liverpool vs Spurs: 12-0 . Southampton vs Newcastle: 10-1 . Arsenal vs Aston Villa: 10-1 . Southampton vs Sunderland: 11-3 (though 2 have been draws) Chelsea vs Swansea: 10-2 . Brendan Rodgers' side have enjoyed 5-0, 4-0, and 3-0 victories against the north London club in the last 16 months, but Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino will no doubt believe his side have a chance to overturn those fortunes with his side and star striker Harry Kane looking in brilliant form. Tottenham's first of three heavy beatings against the Reds came in December, 2013 and saw Luis Suarez begin the rout before goals from Jordan Henderson, Jo Flanagan and Raheem Sterling completed a memorable day for Liverpool at White Hart Lane. Liverpool, who were on the hunt for a first Premier League title in over 20 years, moved to the top of the table after the 4-0 drubbing of Spurs in March as an early own goal from Younes Kaboul sparked another strike from the rampant Suarez leaving Philippe Coutinho and Henderson to do the rest. Steven Gerrard celebrates his goal during Liverpool's victory at White Hart Lane in August, 2014 . Brendan Rodgers (left) and Mauricio Pochettino patrol the White Hart Lane touchline last season . Spurs then suffered their first loss under Pochettino with a 3-0 defeat at White Hart Lane as Sterling, Steven Gerrard and Alberto Moreno compounded the home side's misery in August, 2014. Tuesday night, however, finds Spurs in better form and a better mood coming off the back of Harry Kane's double against Arsenal on Saturday which put the Lily Whites into fifth place in the Premier League, just one point behind Manchester United. Kane, who now has 22 goals to his name this season, is expected to lead the line once again as his side look to end their modern day hoodoo against the Merseyside outfit. Although Tottenham won't be particularly proud of their recent record against Liverpool, it is not their worst in the current top flight. Luis Suarez smiles after putting Liverpool into a two-goal lead against Spurs last year . The Spurs players stand dejected during Liverpool's 4-0 win at Anfield in February, 2014 . Pochettino's side also have a poor record against Premier League champions Manchester City, with the former scoring just twice and conceding 15 goals in their last three meetings. Other undesirable records includ Newcastle's 10-1 aggregate scoreline against Southampton while Arsenal's recent 5-0 win against Aston Villa also gives Paul Lambert's side a 10-1 deficit when adding together the last three games. After a run of fixtures that has seen Spurs collect nine points from their last three Premier League games and Liverpool winning three of their last four before being haulted by Everton, Tuesday night's game looks finely balanced. Spurs will be hoping that by ending their recent hoodoo against Liverpool, they will also be announcing themselves as major contenders for a top four spot come the end of the season. Suarez enjoys scoring in Liverpool's biggest win against Spurs in recent years - a 5-0 victory in December, 2013 .","Tottenham have suffered heavy defeats in last three Premier League clashes against Liverpool .

"Chelsea will be boosted by the return of Cesc Fabregas against Everton on Wednesday, with the Spanish midfielder returning to full training. Fabregas, 27, picked up a hamstring injury during the Capital One Cup win over Liverpool and missed the games against Manchester City and Aston Villa. But he was pictured at the Cobham training base on Tuesday morning with his team-mates, including new signing Juan Cuadrado.

Eden Hazard seems to be enjoying himself along with Nemanja Matic (left) and Nathan Ake (right) 'We coped with the situation but to have him back is important,' manager Jose Mourinho said. Ramires has filled in for the playmaker in recent weeks, as Mourinho's side stretched their lead at the top of the Premier League over City to seven points with a draw  and a victory, most recently at Villa Park. Diego Costa and John Obi Mikel are the only absentees for Chelsea, with the Portuguese boss still cursing his luck that his star striker was out. In fact, he still refuses to say his name in press conferences. 'We don't have the player that is suspended so we have to stick with Didier (Drogba) and (Loic) Remy again,' 'We need the suspended player, but we have coped without him.' New signing from Fiorentina Juan Cuadrado holds off Hazard and Filipe Luis during a training session on Tuesday . Didier Drogba could start against Everton with Diego Costa still out suspended for the Blues . Loic Remy, pictured along with Andreas Christensen and Filipe Luis, is also in the frame to start . Costa (right) sits next to Cesc Fabregas at Stamford Bridge after being banned for three matches . Mourinho voiced his clear displeasure with the FA during the press conference, and gestured with an elbow in a clear reference to Van Persie's challenge on West Ham defender James Tomkins in Sunday's draw. The Van Persie incident was dealt with by the match officials at Upton Park, so there is no scope for retrospective punishment for the United striker. 'I know that if it was one of mine, I know,' Mourinho added. 'Last season happened the same thing, when Ramires was suspended (for elbowing Sunderland's Sebastian Larsson). 'It was exactly the same thing. A Manchester City player kicked a player on the floor at Norwich and nothing happened.' That was a reference to Yaya Toure's challenge on Ricky van Wolswinkel, which went unpunished.

"Brentford are considering the shock step of replacing manager Mark Warburton. Warburton, who is out of contract in the summer, won promotion from League One last season and has guided them to fourth in the Championship with a crucial game against sixth placed Watford on Tuesday night. However, reports emanating from Spain last week say that Brentford have earmarked Rayo Vallecano's highly-rated Paco Jemez as the man to replace Warburton at the end of the season. Brentford are considering parting company with Mark Warburton despite sitting fourth in the Championship . Intermediaries claiming to represent Brentford have approached the former Spain international sounding out his availability, while Warburton insists that he understands 'the club have to plan for any eventuality.' Jemez has plenty of interest and is intrigued by the Brentford project but is keen to take another post in Spain. Warburton, 52, a former defender at Leicester City, has caught the eye of other clubs also with his work at Brentford and it is understood the Griffin Park club is covering all bases by sounding out other options. A club statement read: 'The Club is aware of some press speculation about the future of our Manager, Mark Warburton. 'Given Mark’s increasing profile within the game, we recognise that he will deservedly have turned the heads of other clubs.' Warburton said: 'My only focus is on the team and the match tonight [Tuesday]. I'm disappointed that the focus is on all this rather than the game. We are in a good position with 17 games to go. 'The team have done well and I understand the club have to plan for any eventuality, it is a very forward-thinking club. But my only focus is a big game.' Full back Jake Bidwell challenges Jelle Vossen during Brentford's clash against Middlesbrough . The Brentford statement continued: 'As with every other sensibly run club, we plan for various possible eventualities. 'We are a progressive club who do talk to other people within the game to learn about other ways of doing things, and to consider novel strategic approaches to the game. 'Those conversations continue internally, and are part of a healthy dialogue. 'Football is sometimes called a village, and in any village, gossip and rumours can spread like wildfire, whether or not such rumours are true. 'It would not be in the Club’s interests to disclose any of those discussions, but Brentford FC do want to confirm that Mark Warburton remains our manager. 'The team’s performance has been magnificent this season and that is primarily down to Mark’s leadership. 'Mark will continue to lead the club in its push for Premier League football. 'At this critical stage of the season, we don’t propose to make any further statements in relation to these rumours.'","Brentford are considering parting company with manager Mark Warburton .

"Lassana Diarra is back training with West Ham in the hope of earning a short-term contract. Diarra, 29, has been working with head of medicine Stijn Vandenbroucke, whom he previously worked with at Anzhi Makhachkala. Manager Sam Allardyce invited Diarra to train with the club prior to Christmas as QPR made attempts to sign him. He also held talks with Inter Milan. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Diarra's best tricks, flicks and goals for Lokomotiv Moscow . Lassana Diarra is currently training with West Ham after Sam Allardyce invited him prior to Christmas . Former Chelsea and Arsenal midfielder Diarra is out of contract after leaving Lokomotiv Moscow . 'He is training with us,' Allardyce said. 'I'm not so sure whether we have finalised a deal yet but he is doing a little bit of training with us. The deal is very close to being finalised and on the basis of where we are with our squad and the injuries, once we have him fit he will be a very good addition based on his previous record as a footballer.' Diarra's spell with Lokomotiv Moscow ended acrimoniously after reports he refused to train following a bust-up with manager Leonid Kuckuk but, despite not playing in almost nine months, Allardyce believes the ex-Chelsea, Arsenal and Portsmouth man could soon be part of his first-team squad at Upton Park. 'He won't be in any good shape in terms of being on the bench on Wednesday or on the bench on Saturday against West Brom,' added Allardyce. 'But I certainly hope that, with a good few days training with the lads, he will be close in seven to 10 days if he finally signs the contract.' If the move comes off, it could be seen as something of a coup for the Hammers as Diarra brings experience and has also tasted trophy success, winning the FA Cup with both Chelsea and Portsmouth and the Spanish title at Real Madrid.

"Tim Howard will return in goal for Everton at Chelsea on Wednesday night – but Leighton Baines is set to miss the game with a knee injury. United States international Howard is fit again after recovering from a calf injury sustained against Stoke on Boxing Day. He was close to being fit for last Saturday's Merseyside derby, although manager Roberto Martinez decided not to risk him.

Instead, the 35-year-old will go straight back in against the Premier League leaders, with Joel Robles dropping out – even though the Spaniard has kept clean sheets in each of Everton's last two matches. Martinez said: 'Tim has been working really well. Yesterday, he trained well. He's fully fit now for any sort of games. 'Whenever Tim is fit, he's our number one, for the experience that he has and what he represents to the squad. I've got total faith in him. 'Goalkeeper is not like any other position. I do feel that the outfield positions are more about moments of form, ways of playing against the opposition and different ways of approaching games. In goal you need stability. 'Joel has been really good. I've been so pleased with his last two performances.' Howard is expected to return for Everton in Wednesday night's Premier League match at Chelsea . Joel Robles has been deputising between the stick for Everton in Howard's absence . Left-back Baines, 30, sat out Saturday's 0-0 draw against Liverpool after failing a late fitness test, and Martinez has indicated that he is unlikely to be risked. He said: 'Leighton Baines had a fitness test on the day of the Liverpool game. Today is exactly the same. He hasn't been able to train since then, so it's difficult at the moment to see him being involved. 'We'll see how he is today, we'll assess him again, and we'll make a final decision closer to the game.' Winger Aiden McGeady is out of the Chelsea match with a bruised knee suffered in training – but Martinez is relieved that the injury was not far worse. He said: 'At that time, we were very worried, because his knee had a really bad challenge. We had the scans and did the tests - and nothing is damaged in terms of structure. Leighton Baines is not expected to recover from a knee injury in time to feature against Chelsea . The England full back will have a late fitness test ahead of the game on Wednesday night . Howard's return is a boost for Everton manager Roberto Martinez ahead of the Chelsea match . 'The ligaments and the meniscus are intact. But the bone had a really strong bruise, and that will take a little time to clear, so he's not training at the moment. It will take a few days. 'It's hard to tell how long it's going to take for the bone to be ready, but it's not a big problem. When we first saw the incident, it was a bit of a worry.' Martinez, meanwhile, insists that right-back Seamus Coleman's future is at Everton, despite suggestions that he should move on. Former Manchester United and Republic of Ireland defender Denis Irwin has said that Coleman needs to join a bigger European club to further his career. But Martinez said: 'I still think that Seamus Coleman can develop and progress with Everton. 'He's become important in the team that we want to grow in order to achieve big things as well. Sometimes that's better than going to a club in Europe where you're not guaranteed to play. 'This is the best place for him to develop his potential.

Manchester United find themselves currently fourth in the Premier League table with 44 points, following a disappointing 1-1 draw with eighth-placed West Ham at The Boleyn Ground. The Hammers had taken the lead through Cheikhou Kouyate's swivel and close-range stab, but The Red Devils' blushes were spared thanks to Daley Blind's late equaliser. The West Ham defenders form a wall as the United captain tries a free kick from just outside the box . Rooney has found himself at the centre of some tactical controversy recently as fans and pundits alike have questioned United manager Louis van Gaal's decision to deploy the player, traditionally viewed as a striker, in midfield. Although The Red Devils do remain in the Champions League spots, concerns have been raised over how convincing that position is, especially given how extensively Van Gaal has been backed in the transfer market. High-profile signings such as Angel di Maria and on-loan striker Radamel Falcao have failed to hit the form their reputations suggest of them and United face stiff competition from Southampton, Tottenham and Liverpool in their bid to return to Europe's top club competition. United boss Louis van Gaal has come under scrutiny in recent weeks for playing Rooney in midfield .

"Real Madrid president Florentino Perez was at the club's training ground on Monday for 'crisis talks' with players and coaching staff. After their shock 4-0 defeat by Atletico in the Madrid derby, Tuesday's Spanish papers are still dealing with the fallout, with Marca and AS leading on Perez's visit to Valdebebas. Marca report that the Madrid chief spent two hours at the training complex, telling Carlo Ancelotti and his players: 'This is Madrid, millions of people follow us around the world.' AS' headline on Tuesday's back page translates as: 'I want you to return to the Madrid you were before' AS refer to the meeting as a 'crisis cabinet', with Perez saying: 'I want you to return to the Madrid you were before.' Ancelotti's side were thrashed at the Vicente Calderon on Saturday, with goals from Tiago Mendes, Saul Niguez, Antoine Griezmann and Mario Mandzukic. To make matters worse in the eyes of supporters, Cristiano Ronaldo was pictured laughing as he hosted his 30th birthday party later that night, leading to supporters brandishing banners reading: 'Your laughter, our shame' outside the training ground. Despite the result, Real sit top of La Liga, one point ahead of Barcelona and four above Atletico. It seems, though, more is needed from the team to quell the anger of supporters. Marca lead on Madrid too, with the headline 'He put it firmly' (left) while Antonio Conte is Tuttosport's focus . In Italy, the big news in Tuesday's papers deals with the future of national team coach Antonio Conte. There has been much speculation after reports that he was furious at having to cancel a national team get-together when clubs indicated they would not release their players from domestic duties. But the back pages of the Italian papers indicate that he will stay in charge of the side until Euro 2016. Conte will stay in charge of the Italian national team until Euro 2016, Corriere dello Sport report . Corriere dello Sport have the headline 'Conte's Surrender', with a quote from the Italian coach reading: 'Like it or not, I'll remain until Euro 2016.' Tuttosport's leading line is much the same, with Conte quoted as saying: 'Like it or not, I will remain until the end of my contract, despite great difficulties, to achieve something unexpected.'

"Manchester City, Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal will all have to rethink their summer recruitment plans after Marco Reus confirmed that he has signed a new contract with relegation-threatened Borussia Dortmund until 2019. Reus' new deal is understood to be worth £6million a year plus £1.5m a year in image rights - equating to around £145,000 a week. It is an extraordinary step of faith by Reus to commit to Dortmund, who are 16th in Bundlesliga, in danger of relegation and with no prospect of qualifying for the Champions League next season, except in the highly unlikely event that they were to win the trophy this season. Borussia Dortmund star Marco Reus has signed a new four-year contract with the club . Reus poses with Dortmund's director of football Michael Zorc (left) and chairman Hans-Joachim Watzke . Even more remarkably the deal does not contain a specific release clause - an outstanding piece of negotiation by Dortmund managing director Michael Zorc, given that Reus had a £20m release clause in his former contract which could be activated this summer. 'I am happy to have extended the contract,' Reus said in a club video interview. 'When I came here (in 2012) I said I wanted to do things. I have the feeling that it's not over even in this situation.' 'We fall together and we win together, It is a decision for life. I did not think about it that long for no reason.' In a statement to the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the club confirmed that the £20m release clause had been removed and that there were now no further release clauses in the deal. The 25-year-old Dortmund-born midfielder, widely considered one of the best in the world, would have been available for a bargain fee, with Dortmund missing out on cashing in on one of their biggest assets had the clause remained. Marco Reus scored in 3-0 victory at Freiburg which lifted Borussia Dortmund off the bottom of the table . Now they can expect to receive at least £50m for Reus - and the prospect of at least another season from him. Despite a clamour of interest from the leading English clubs, with United and City leading the chase, Reus' next move has always been more likely to Spain, with Real Madrid having been the club expected to sign him this summer. Reus, however, is understood to have been keener on a move to Barcelona - but that prospect was scuppered by FIFA's transfer ban on the Catalan club, meaning they cannot sign new players until 2016 for breaching rules in recruiting young overseas players. Signing a new deal at Dortmund means that he is immediately elevated into the realms of one of the elite world footballers in terms of wages - and can now wait 18 months to join Barcelona, where his friend Marc-Andre ter Stegen is the reserve-team goalkeeper . Whatever the plans for the future, for now Dortmund are celebrating their coup in persuading Reus, who was a Dortmund fan as a boy, to stay. Jurgen Klopp wants to build new Dortmund team around German midfielder Reus . 'We never let ourselves be influenced by all the transfer rumours and we always saw a good chance that this exceptional player could consciously decide in favour of Dortmund,' said Hans-Joachim Watzke, chief executive at Dortmund. 'Marco can become an iconic player at Dortmund, like Uwe Sweeler was at Hamburg or Steven Gerrard at Liverpool.' 'The fact that he is has chose to lengthen his deal here at a time of crisis on the pitch shows how strongly he identifies with the club is and we're very proud of that.' Zorc said: 'Marco could have chosen any top club in the world. The fact that he has taken this decision shown that is heart is with his home town and his home club. 'For Dortmund, who lost centre forward Robert Lewandowski to Bayern Munich last summer on a free transfer after they failed to lengthen his deal and also lost Mario Goetze to Bayern, who activated his £30m buy-out clause in 2013, the Reus deal represents the highlight thus far or a dreadful season on the pitch.","Marco Reus extends Borussia Dortmund contract until 2019 .

"Michael Laudrup has emerged as favourite to replace Harry Redknapp as manager at QPR. Tim Sherwood had been considered the man to take over but those talks have stalled while QPR chairman Tony Fernandes tweeted on Tuesday to say he has found the 'dream' replacement for Redknapp, who resigned last week. 'Think I have got my dream manager. Not what anyone thinks. Take a while. Still a bit to go but I'm very happy. Press all wrong. Michael Laudrup is the favourite to succeed Harry Redknapp as QPR's manager this season . Former Tottenham boss Tim Sherwood was the early frontrunner for the vacant job at Loftus Road . 'Focus tonight is on the game. Support Chris and the boys. We are all in this together and want what's best for QPR. Come on you rssss.' Laudrup's odds have been slashed from 40/1 to 3/1 favourite by some bookmakers - with one major company suspending all betting on the potential outcome. The 50-year-old is currently coaching in Qatar after a two-year stint with Swansea City ended with his sacking a year ago. During his time in south Wales, Laudrup guided the Swans to their first major trophy in their history with the 2012/13 Capital One Cup trophy in his debut season at the club. Sherwood, who has been odds on since  Redknapp stepped down, has drifted from 1/3 to 7/1 - the same price as the potentially outgoing Brentford manager, Mark Warburton.

Sherwood (right) was believed to have had talks to replace Harry Redknapp - who quit earlier this month . Redknapp will undergo double knee replacement surgery in coming weeks - and quit due to that resason . Sherwood, who worked under Redknapp during his time at Tottenham, was believed to have opened talks with QPR last week over becoming their next manager. Redknapp quit Loftus Road earlier this month, citing the fact he requires two knee operations as the reason behind his decision. Sherwood was understood to be the preferred choice of Les Ferdinand, who has been given a new role as director of football by chairman Fernandes, but it appears that the club have decided to go in a different direction with Laudrup. Ferdinand had been placed in temporary charge of the first-team along with coach Chris Ramsey but the latter oversaw their 1-0 Premier League defeat at home to Southampton on Saturday alongside Kevin Bond. The duo are also in charge of the club's midweek crunch clash away to Sunderland on Tuesday night. Ramsey took charge of QPR's 1-0 Premier League home defeat against Southampton on Saturday . Earlier on Tuesday, Japan's football chiefs refused to comment on reports linking Danish former Barcelona and Real Madrid star Laudrup to the national team's vacant coaching job. Laudrup, who won league titles as a player with some of Europe's biggest clubs, had emerged as a possible replacement for sacked Mexican Javier Aguirre. Former England coach Glenn Hoddle, who left his role as part of QPR's coaching staff following Redknapp's exit, is also believed to be in the running for the Japan job. QPR will be hoping to have a new manager in place by the time of their Premier League trip to Hull on February 21. The west London outfit currently sit 19th in the Premier League table with 19 points after 24 games, but are yet to pick up a single point away from home.

"A dental assistant fired for being too attractive was sent text messages by her bosses asking how often she 'experiences orgasms'. Melissa Nelson, 32, was sent the raunchy text by Iowa dentist James Knight around six months before she was sacked. Documents from the Iowa Supreme Court show Knight had previously made inappropriate comments at work about his employee's clothing being too tight or distracting. Fired: Melissa Nelson was so attractive, Iowa dentist James Knight fired her out of fear she'd make him want to stray from his marriage . Hello ladies: Despite Nelson being 21 years younger than him, married, and 'not interested in a relationship,' Knight believed it would be too hard not to start an affair with her . Justices wrote: 'Dr Knight acknowledges he once told Nelson that if she saw his pants bulging, she would know her clothing was too revealing.' Dr Knight's lawyers argue it was Mrs Nelson who acted inappropriately and that is why she was fired. Attorney Stuart Cochrane said: 'She’s an attractive lady. Dr. Knight found her behavior and dress to be inappropriate.' But Mrs Nelson said she was shocked to discover the reasons behind her sacking. She told ABC News: 'I was very surprised after working so many years side by side I didn’t have any idea that that would have crossed his mind.' Ms Nelson has also slammed the court' s 'completely wrong' decision to rule in favour of Dr Knight.She said: 'I think it is sending a message that men can do whatever they want in the work force' The court ruled 7-0 on Friday that bosses can sack employees they see as an 'irresistible attraction,' even if they have not engaged in flirtatious behavior or otherwise done anything wrong. Appearing on CNN Friday night, assistant Mrs Nelson said the decision was deeply unfair. 'I don't think this is fair,' she said from her Iowa home by phone. 'I don't think this is right.' Such firings may be unfair, but they . are not unlawful discrimination under the Iowa Civil Rights Act because . they are motivated by feelings and emotions, and not gender, Justice . Edward Mansfield wrote. Content: Happily married with children Nelson said she saw Knight as a father figure and had 'absolutely' no interest in him romantically . An attorney for the Fort Dodge dentist said the decision, the first of its kind in Iowa, is a victory for family values because Knight fired Nelson in the interest of saving his marriage, not because she was a woman. But Nelson's attorney said Iowa's all-male high court, one of only a handful in the nation, failed to recognize the discrimination women see routinely in the workplace. Nelson insisted she was never interested in Knight romantically, regardless of his own feelings. 'Absolutely not,' she said. 'I'm happily married.' Since Knight fired her she has worked as a waitress six nights a week. While her former boss claimed her clothes were so tight he couldn't look at her without being aroused, Nelson said the only outfit she wore to work was standard scrubs worn by many nurses and assistants in dental offices. Asked if she saw herself as irresistibly attractive, Nelson laughed at the question. Family man: Knight's wife, who also works in the dental office, demanded Nelson be fired when she discovered text messages . 'I'm just an ordinary girl,' she said. 'Just an ordinary mom.' Also appearing via call-in, her attorney, Paige Fiedler, said it was unlikely they would seek an appeal because of the way the case was filed as only interpreting state law. 'These judges sent a message to Iowa women that they don't think men can be held responsible for their sexual desires and that Iowa women are the ones who have to monitor and control their bosses' sexual desires,' Fielder said.  'If they get out of hand, then the women can be legally fired for it.' Nelson, 32, worked for Knight for 10 years, and he considered her a stellar worker. But in the final months of her employment, he complained that her tight clothing was distracting, once telling her that if his pants were bulging that was a sign her clothes were too revealing, according to the opinion. He also once allegedly remarked about her infrequent sex life by saying, 'that's like having a Lamborghini in the garage and never driving it.' 'That's like having a Lamborghini in the garage and never driving it.' Knight and Nelson — both married with children — started exchanging text messages, mostly about personal matters, such as their families. Knight's wife, who also worked in the dental office, found out about the messages and demanded Nelson be fired. The Knights consulted with their pastor, who agreed that terminating Nelson was appropriate. Knight fired Nelson and gave her one month's severance. He later told Nelson's husband he worried he was getting too personally attached and feared he would eventually try to start an affair with her. Ordinary mom: Nelson has been working as a waitress since she lost her dental job and is unsure of her future career path . Nelson was stunned because she viewed . the 53-year-old Knight as a father figure and had never been interested . in starting a relationship, Fiedler said. Nelson filed a lawsuit alleging gender discrimination, arguing she would not have been terminated if she was male. She did not allege sexual harassment because Knight's conduct may not have risen to that level and didn't particularly offend her, Fiedler said. 'The motives . behind Dr. Knight terminating Mrs. Nelson were quite clear: He did so . to preserve his marriage. Knight argued Nelson was fired not because of her gender, but because her continued employment threatened his marriage. A district judge agreed, dismissing the case before trial, and the high court upheld that ruling. Mansfield noted that Knight had an all-female workforce and Nelson was replaced by a woman. He said the decision was in line with state and federal court rulings that found workers can be fired for relationships that cause jealousy and tension within a business owner's family. One such case from the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a business owner's firing of a valued employee who was seen by his wife as a threat to their marriage. In that case, the fired employee had engaged in flirtatious conduct. Jurisprudence: Justice Edward Mansfield penned the Iowa Supreme Court's decision on Knight's dismissal of Melissa Nelson . Mansfield said allowing Nelson's lawsuit would stretch the definition of discrimination to allow anyone fired over a relationship to file a claim arguing they would not have been fired but for their gender. Knight's attorney, Stuart Cochrane, said the court got it right. The decision clarified that bosses can make decisions showing favoritism to a family member without committing discrimination; in this case, by allowing Knight to honor his wife's wishes to fire Nelson, he said. Knight is a very religious and moral individual, and he sincerely believed that firing Nelson would be best for all parties, he said. 'While there was really no fault on the part of Mrs. Nelson, it was just as clear the decision to terminate her was not related to the fact that she was a woman,' he said. 'The motives behind Dr. Knight terminating Mrs. Nelson were quite clear: He did so to preserve his marriage. 'I don't view this as a decision that was either pro-women or opposed to women rights at all. In my view, this was a decision that followed the appropriate case law.'","Melissa Nelson was sent raunchy text six month before she was sacked .

"To mark the fiftieth anniversary of the last execution in Britain today a newly-elected UKIP MEP has called for its reintroduction. Louise Bours, who represents North West England in the European Parliament, said there was no ‘ethical reason’ to keep child killers and police murderers alive. The remarks, which come as anti-death penalty activists welcomed today’s milestone, are likely to spark controversy. Scroll down for video . Louise Bours, appearing on BBC's Question Time alongside footballer Joey Barton (right), has called for the reintroduction of the death penalty . The final executions in Britain were carried out on August 13, 1964. Peter Allen and Gwynne Evans were hanged simultaneously in Liverpool and Manchester for the murder of John West - a 53 year-old van driver, who died in a bloody heap at his home after being bludgeoned with an iron bar. Their crime was quickly exposed after a neighbour was woken up by a suspicious noise in Mr West's house and looked out to see a car disappearing down the street. Evans made the fatal mistake of leaving his raincoat at the scene. It only took a matter of days for police to track down and arrest the killers. They were found guilty in June, had their appeals rejected on July 21 and were hanged three weeks later. It comes as a poll shows falling support for capital punishment – although the public are still narrowly in favour of its reintroduction. Ms Bours, UKIP’s health spokesman, claimed today that the public were ‘fed up’ with the criminal justice system. She said: ‘The death penalty won’t bring back a tortured and murdered child, but it seems natural justice that the family will know the killer has paid the ultimate price and isn’t still breathing when their child is not. ‘An innocent child has more of a right to life than the monster that took their life, so I see no ethical reason why we are obliged to keep him alive. ‘Why should double cop-killer Dale Cregan be kept alive, after shooting them more than 8 times and using a hand-grenade. His crime wasn’t impulsive or emotional, he lured them in with a fake 999 call and he’d killed two other people prior to that.’ She added: ‘Paul Bone, the father of murdered WPC Fiona Bone agrees that the death penalty should be brought back, and as his life has been devastated by a cold-blooded killer, I think his views should be listened to. ‘The killers of Lee Rigby despise the UK and want to kill us all, yet we have to use tax-payers money to keep them alive and well in prison, and look after their ‘human-rights’. Despite strong support for the death penalty among UKIP supporters it is not the party’s official policy. But Ms Bours said: ‘The country has not had a debate on this issue for 10 years. ‘UKIP believe in direct democracy, which means referendums on major issues, where the public demand one. ‘If there were a referendum, I would support a return of the death penalty for certain types of crimes.’ A YouGov poll released to coincide with the anniversary of the last death penalty in Britain has revealed that 45 per cent of the public are in favour of capital punishment – with 39 per cent against. A similar poll four years ago found 51 per cent of the public favoured the reintroduction of capital punishment. Opposition to the death penalty’s reintroduction is strongest among 18- to 24-year-olds – with 52 per cent against. UKIP's Ms Bours said the notorious killers of Drummer Lee Rigy - Michael Adebolajo (left) and Michael Adebowale (right) - should be sentenced to death . The strongest support for reintroduction was among Ukip voters, the over-60s and the poor. The country was split – 42 per cent to 42 per cent - over whether it was a good or bad thing that Britain had abolished the death penalty. More than half – 57 per cent - of 18- to 24-year-olds thought abolition was a good thing. Questioned about whether they approved of methods of execution, 51 per cent either strongly approved or tended to approve of lethal injection, 25 per cent of the electric chair, 23 per cent of hanging, 19 per cent by gas chamber, 17 per cent by firing squad, and 9 per cent by beheading.","Louise Bours said there was no ‘ethical reason’ to keep child killers alive .

"A wealthy North Texas socialite has been sentenced to 14 years in federal prison after pleading guilty in a rare case of a woman being caught up in trading child pornography. Prosecutors say 43-year-old Erika Susan Perdue was sentenced Monday after pleading guilty last year to one count of transporting and shipping child pornography. She was given an eight-year term of supervised release and was ordered to pay a $10,000 fine and $5,000 in restitution to one of the victims identified as 'Vicky.' Scroll down for video . Guilty as sin: Dallas housewife Erika Perdue, 43, was sentenced to 14 years after admitting to sharing and swapping child pornography for 13 years . Upon her release, Perdue will have to register as a sex offender. During her sentencing Monday, a haggard-looking Perdue sobbed and told the presiding judge that she was 'very remorseful.' 'I lost two granddaughters to this,' she said in court, according to Dallas Morning News. A search warrant was executed in April 2012 at her $1.4million home in the Dallas enclave of University Park. Prosecutors say Perdue, who is married to prominent intellectual property attorney Mark Perdue and has two grandchildren, admitted to trading child pornography and getting high on meth while her husband was at work. Mrs Perdue was indicted in May 2012. She's been in custody since June of that year after violating conditions of her release. Records show that the the woman, who was diagnosed with a bi-polar disorder after her arrest, was ejected from a treatment program for her 'threatening behavior.' Cache: Perdue had amassed so large a collection of graphic videos and photos depicting children she had trouble keeping track of them . Mrs Perdue is alleged to have amassed so large a collection of graphic videos and photos depicting children she had trouble keeping track of them. The 43-year-old, who lived with her attorney husband in one of Dallas's most expensive areas, reportedly told police she traded in the illegal images every day. Perdue was arrested in 2012 after unwittingly trading child porn with an undercover detective, the Dallas Morning News reported. According to court documents, the housewife admitted to the FBI that she has been distributing child porn since 1999. In April 2012, police officers armed with search warrants raided her $1.4million, 4,000-square-foot mansion and seized her computers, where they found a large cache of X-rated videos and still photos. Agents said the images were extremely graphic and showed children — some of them toddlers — having intercourse with adults. Police began their investigation in January 2012 after undercover officers made contact with Perdue on file-sharing sites. The socialite used the name 'Classybitch' and unknowingly shared images with the undercover agents.

Personalized: Her 2010 Chevrolet Camaro has vanity license plates 'MY SYN' New residence: Perdue will spend the next 14 years living at the Mansfield federal prison . Perdue told investigators she was on the computer swapping and collecting child porn even on the day of the raid. 'She also confessed that she used file-sharing child pornography every day,' agents wrote in court documents.

Raised . in a humble Garland home, her parents split when she was 7 years old. While Miss Perdue was still in high school, she had her first child and . got married at age 17. Less than three years later, Perdue's husband filed for divorce. Double life: The socialite used the name 'Classybitch' and unknowingly shared images with undercover cops . Justice: Perdue was given an eight-year term of supervised release and was ordered to pay a $10,000 fine and $5,000 in restitution . Perdue's second marriage, which took place when she was 22, ended in a similar fashion after she was charged with a misdemeanor for making profanity-laced harassing phone calls to her sister-in-law. In 2009, the twice-divorced mother took another walk down the aisle, this time with Dallas-area attorney Mark Perdue. According to her mother, Mr Perdue has remained loyal to his disgraced wife throughout the ordeal and visits her regularly at the Mansfield Federal Detention Center.","Erika Perdue, 43, was given 8 years' probation and ordered to pay a $10,000 fine and $5,000 in restitution .

"Worrying: Big Brother contestant Dan Neal worked on the Jimmy Savile police case . Detectives are being paid overtime to watch Big Brother. The ‘cushiest job ever’ is so Scotland Yard officers can monitor a former colleague taking part in the Channel 5 reality programme. Dan Neal, 33, stunned Met bosses when he entered the Big Brother house last week. Until recently he was working on Operation Yewtree – the inquiry into Jimmy Savile and allegations of historic sex offences by other celebrities. Senior officers raised fears that Mr Neal could compromise their highly sensitive investigation, prompting the programme’s producers to agree to a five-minute delay on the ‘live’ footage. And detectives are mounting a costly round-the-clock operation to monitor the programme over the next two months, it has emerged. Incredibly, the force is offering an inducement to watch Big Brother this weekend. Because they have been given less than 15 days’ notice to work on a rostered rest day, officers will receive time-and-a-half overtime pay. Detectives are also entitled to a 10 per cent bonus for hours worked between 8pm and 6am – whether or not they are on a scheduled day off. A source said: ‘This has to be the cushiest police job ever. Questions have to be asked whether this is really necessary.’ It is not known how many officers will be in the office at any one time watching the programme, and recording it in case of the need for evidence. But a source said that it was ‘good practice’ for two officers to be on duty together, in case one falls ill or asleep – even though there is no longer a 24-hour live TV stream of Big Brother. Most days, only two hours are broadcast live from the house, with a further two hours of ‘highlights’ and analysis’. There is also a daily Twitter feed from 8am to 2am which officers are believed to be monitoring. Last week it was reported that police were ‘frantically ringing around’ Savile’s victims to reassure them their identities would not be revealed by Mr Neal, the 3-1 favourite to win the show, which runs until August 19. The overtime bonanza has fuelled concerns about the running of Operation Yewtree – which critics claim has become a celebrity witch-hunt – when Scotland Yard is trying to make cuts of £500million. Mouthing off: Police are monitoring what is said by Dan Neal, pictured with Gina Rio . Around 30 detectives are working full-time on the investigation, set up last autumn in the aftermath of the Savile scandal. It has already cost £1million, including salaries, various costs and more than £200,000 in overtime. Detectives are said to be contacting anyone who was interviewed by Mr Neal. The former officer – believed to have been involved in two high-profile Yewtree arrests – tried to avoid discussing his police career on his first night in the Big Brother house, describing himself as ‘unemployed’. He told host Emma Willis: ‘I’d done ten and a half years in the police and I’ve worked really hard and achieved a lot. I just need a change. I wanted to explore the creative side of my personality.’ Lawyer Liz Dux, head of the abuse department of Slater & Gordon, which represents 62 alleged victims of Savile, said: ‘This is extremely traumatic for some of the victims. ‘They have poured their hearts out to this detective – some of them disclosing details which they haven’t yet told their family. ‘Now they fear that him appearing on Big Brother will mean that some highly confidential information will be revealed. It’s not just the fear of what might come out on nation television, it’s also the fear of what this detective might be telling other housemates when the cameras are not on him which is giving them such torment.’ No fear: Neal has certainly opened up since he entered the Big Brother house . New direction: Neal has said he left the police to explore a new side to his life . Channel 5 refused to be drawn on criticism levelled at the programme. It said: ‘Channel 5 takes its obligations as a broadcaster seriously and, as has been made clear to New Scotland Yard, extensive procedures are in place to ensure that nothing will be broadcast during the course of Big Brother which would involve the former police officer breaching confidentiality, invading the privacy of others, committing libel or a contempt of court.’ Last night a Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘The Metropolitan Police has raised our concerns with Channel 5 about the potential risks posed to live investigations by featuring a former detective constable who worked on those investigations. ‘The integrity of those investigations and our care for victims are of the utmost importance. Measures have been put in place to mitigate any risk. Unfortunately initially we had no choice but to spend overtime to ensure we monitored the comments being made on the Channel 5 programme over the weekend as we did not have prior notification of his inclusion on the programme. The need to pay overtime is now significantly reduced and the ongoing necessity to review the programme remains under regular review.’ Revealed: Dan Neal was involved in the Jimmy Savile case which found the deceased TV presenter to be one of 'the most prolific sex offenders' The spokesman said the cost of monitoring the programme would be released ‘in due course’. Last month the Mail revealed that comedian Jim Davidson was being investigated by Yewtree officers over claims that he indecently assaulted a woman in the Falkland Islands in the 1980s. Detectives are probing claims he committed the alleged offence during a concert tour after the Falklands War. Davidson, 59, was originally arrested in January over alleged sex offences in the UK. He denies all the allegations. Other arrested celebrities include, entertainer Rolf Harris, DJ Dave Lee Travis and comedian Freddie Starr. Disgraced pop star Gary Glitter has also been detained. They also deny any wrongdoing. PR guru Max Clifford has been charged with 11 counts of indecently assaulting teenage girls between 1966 and 1985. The 70-year-old has vowed to clear his name, labelling the allegations ‘a load of nonsense’.

"Republican Chris Christie has signed a law barring licensed therapists from trying to turn gay teenagers straight. The New Jersey governor said the health risks of trying to change a child's sexual orientation trumped concerns over the government setting limits on parental choice. His decision yesterday was the latest example of the potential 2016 presidential candidate steering a moderate course. Moderate: New Jersey Republican Governor Chris Christie, pictured in Boston last week, has signed  speaks to fellow Republicans,a bill banning therapists from trying to convert gay and lesbians to being straight . Should licensed therapists be banned from trying to turn gay teens straight? Should licensed therapists be banned from trying to turn gay teens straight? Now share your opinion . He stated in his signing note: 'Government should tread carefully into this area.. and I do so here reluctantly'. The decision marked the third time this month that Christie has staked out a moderate position on a hot-button social issue as he seeks a second term in a Democratic-leaning state. It also offers more evidence that the popular governor is positioning himself as a pragmatist who shuns more conservative elements within his party. Christie found middle ground on medical marijuana for children when he agreed Friday to allow growers to cultivate additional strains, and for marijuana to be made in an edible form for chronically ill children. But he would not lift an oversight provision that could require as many as three doctors to sign off on a prescription. Last week, Christie vetoed a bill banning .50-caliber rifles that was vigorously opposed by firearms rights advocates and gutted a proposed overhaul of the state's gun permit law that relied on undeveloped technology. Recently, he signed 10 less-significant gun measures the Democrat-led Legislature passed after last year's deadly school shooting rampage in Newtown, Connecticut. Standing out: The decision marked the third time this month that Christie, pictured, has staked out a moderate position on a hot-button social issue as he seeks a second term in a Democratic-leaning state . The decisions allow Christie to quiet some of the criticism he could face from conservatives by offering specific reasons why he was taking the steps, often citing compassion for the needs of children and families. His approval of the conversion therapy ban could be met with criticism in Christian conservative circles with influence in early voting states like Iowa and South Carolina. Conversion therapy gained attention two years ago when former GOP presidential candidate Michele Bachmann was questioned over whether her husband's Christian counseling business provided services that attempted to change gays and lesbians. Bachmann's husband, Marcus, denied involvement in the therapy and the congresswoman dropped out of the presidential campaign in January 2012 after a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses. In signing the ban, Christie reiterated his belief that people are born gay and homosexuality is not a sin, a position he first stated in a 2011 interview with CNN's Piers Morgan. That view is inconsistent with his Catholic faith, which teaches that homosexual acts are sins. Christie said on 'issues of medical treatment for children we must look to experts in the field to determine the relative risks and rewards,' citing a litany of potential ill effects of trying to change sexual orientation, including depression, drug abuse and suicide. 'I believe that exposing children to these health risks without clear evidence of benefits that outweigh these serious risks is not appropriate,' he said. The New Jersey Governor, who has denied his actions recently have had anything to do with plans to run for presidency in 2016, has for the third time this month made a decision along the lines of a more moderate position on a hot-button social issue . Christie, however, has not moderated his position on gay marriage, which he vetoed and continues to oppose. As a result, gay rights activists applauded Monday's bill signing but pushed for more. 'It is our truest hope that the governor will realize, as the majority of the legislature and a super-majority of the public have realized, that the best way to ensure lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender youth are protected from the abuse of being ostracized is to provide them with equality,' Troy Stevenson, executive director of the state's largest gay rights group, Garden State Equality, said in a statement. Christie has said he supports the state's civil union law, which was enacted to give gay couples the benefits of marriage but not the title. Several couples have since sued, claiming the law provides them unequal treatment. A court decision is expected next month. Gay rights groups say conversion therapy damages young people, because it tells them that it's not acceptable to be whoever they are. Some social conservatives framed the debate as a parental rights issue, saying a ban on the counseling would limit the ability of parents to do what they think is best for their children. Conversion therapy has increasingly drawn criticism for its methods. Last year, four gay men sued a Jersey City group for fraud, saying its program included making them strip naked and attack effigies of their mothers with baseball bats. California has also banned it.","New Jersey governor said health risks outweighed limiting parental choice .

It also lists the intention to run a trademarked loyalty and incentive scheme among its activities. This could potentially see easyFoodstore launch its own loyalty card to rival Tesco's Clubcard and Sainsbury's Nectar scheme, which would mark it out from the likes of Asda, Aldi and Lidl, which do not offer loyalty schemes.

Gerry Goffin's key songs written with Carole King: . Gerry Goffin's key songs written without Carole King: . King, while backing the project and with one of their daughters acting as a producer, had avoided seeing it for months because it dredged up sad memories. She finally sat through it in April. The musical shows the two composing their songs at Aldon Music, the Brill Building publishing company in Manhattan that also employed Neil Sedaka, Howard Greenfield and Carole Bayer Sager. The show ends just as King is enjoying fame for her groundbreaking solo album Tapestry. Though it also alleges Goffin's womanizing and mental instability were causes of the breakup, he happily attended the opening of the musical. A spokeswoman for the show said the cast would dedicate Thursday night's performance to Goffin. After his divorce from King, Goffin garnered an Academy Award nomination with Michael Masser for the theme to the 1975 film Mahogany for Diana Ross. He also earned a Golden Globe nomination for So Sad the Song in 1977 from the film Pipe Dreams. Goffin was born in Brooklyn in 1939 and was working as an assistant chemist when he met King at Queens College. 'She was interested in writing rock 'n' roll, and I was interested in writing this Broadway play,' Goffin told Vanity Fair in 2001. 'So we had an agreement where she would write [music] to the play if I would write [lyrics] to some of her rock 'n' roll melodies. 'And eventually it came to be a boy-and-girl relationship. Eventually I began to lose heart in my play, and we stuck to writing rock 'n' roll.'

A whirlwind romance led to a marriage and their first hit, when she was only 17 and he was 20, Will You Love Me Tomorrow for the Shirelles, which a pregnant King helped write while suffering morning sickness. Both quit their day jobs to focus on music, and other songs followed, including Up on the Roof for the Drifters, One Fine Day for the Chiffons and Chains, which was later covered by the Beatles. Goffin also collaborated with another Aldon composer, Barry Mann, on the hit Who Put the Bomp (In the Bomp Bomp Bomp Bomp). King and Goffin wrote The Loco-Motion, which eventually was sung by their one-time baby sitter Little Eva. Duet: Gerry Goffin pictured with his wife Michelle at the opening night of his former spouse's Broadway show Beautiful: The Carole King Musical, in New York . Goffin continued co-writing songs, including I've Got to Use My Imagination recorded by Gladys Knight and the Pips, and It's Not the Spotlight, recorded by Rod Stewart. In the 1980s and '90s, he co-wrote Tonight I Celebrate My Love, a duet recorded by Peabo Bryson and Roberta Flack, Miss You Like Crazy sung by Natalie Cole and the Whitney Houston mega-hit Savin' All My Love for You. In 1996, he released his final album, titled Back Room Blood. He is survived by his five children, six grandchildren and his wife Michelle.","Gerry Goffin wrote more than 50 top 40 hits for such artists as Whitney Houston, Diana Ross, the Monkees and Gladys Knight .

"It will sell low-cost unbranded food in cheap locations aimed at people ‘on benefits’ and in poorly-paid jobs. And, true to its founder’s philosophy of offering pared-back, no-frills service, eventually it won’t even take cash. EasyJet entrepreneur Stelios Haji-Ioannou has unveiled details for his first easyFoodstore budget supermarket – his latest venture after bargain easyJet flights and windowless rooms at the easyHotel. Scroll down for video . Easyjet entrepreneur Stelios Haji-Ioannou hopes the store (mock up teacher) will become the UK's leading cashless supermarket . He hopes it will eventually become the UK’s first cashless supermarket, suggesting it is cheaper to process card payments than to cash up every day and pay a security firm to bank it. But the company admits that, in an effort to compete with discount chains such as Aldi and Lidl, staff wages will also be low-cost. All goods will be unbranded ‘with white labels’ and, with a mark-up far lower than local corner stores, will cost an average of 50p per item. THE easyFoodstore could become the country’s first cash-less supermarket. Customers would have to pay by debit or credit card or an Oyster card-style system where they top-up a payment card online or at the Post Office. The firm said cash was more expensive for the business to process, and ‘the demise of benefits received by Giro cheques means the vast majority of benefits recipients all have to have bank accounts’ and therefore will have cards. More than half of all transactions in shops were made with cash last year, but is declining. In terms of the total amounts of money taken, cash accounts for just a quarter. But the British Retail Consortium said it was ‘absolutely not true’ card payments were cheaper to process. Head of payments Richard Braham said: ‘Stores can negotiate on costs associated with cash but you can’t negotiate on card costs.’ Baked beans could cost under 20p, threatening to trigger a repeat of the price wars of the 1990s started by now-defunct Kwik Save, when own-label beans fell to 3p and bread to 7p. Sir Stelios claims he was inspired to create an ultra-budget store after reading about the growth of food banks in Britain. He said even if he only breaks even or runs at a small loss, he will persist if the venture meets a need. He revealed a mock-up of the store in an office block in Croydon this week – a rather barren layout covered with orange posters saying: ‘No expensive brands, just honestly priced.’ His honesty about workers’ wages might be less welcome. His spokesman said: ‘We are aiming to be a low-cost supermarket so we need to keep costs low, property rent has got to be low, stock prices have got to be low and, inevitably, we will be looking towards the bottom end of the salary scale for employees.’ EasyFoodstore is looking to open in deprived parts of south-east London ‘which fit our demographic’, who ‘will either be on benefits or in low-paid or zero-hour jobs’. The first store had been due to launch this year but came up against Croydon Council’s planning restrictions. The firm now hopes to open its first shop next summer. It will sell frozen and dried food, and only a few fresh items such as milk, bread and ‘maybe apples and oranges’. There will be ‘no booze or fags’ because it is too liable to theft, the spokesman said.","Easyjet entrepreneur Stelios Haji-Ioannou revealed plans for a shop .

"CSI has taken a step closer to reality as rapid DNA testing that could identify killers in hours has been revealed. The method reduces the time taken to identify suspects at a crime scene from days, preventing suspects going on the run or committing another offense before they are apprehended. Rapid DNA, in tandem with innovative fingerprint technology, is being heralded as a significant revolution in crime scene investigations. The UK Home Office has invested £431,000 ($732,000) in development of 'Rapid DNA' as part of the Police Innovation Fund. Through the endeavour they are hoping to improve the accuracy and speed of identifying suspects at a crime scene, and prevent instances of false identification . A technlogy being developed by Sheffield Hallam University (SHU) is offering more complete identification of criminals. Their microscopic technology is called . Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation Mass Spectrometry Imaging . (MALDI-MSI) and it traces drugs, hair and cleaning products in . fingerprints. It has been developed by researchers at SHU’s Biomedical Research Centre (BMRC). The technology uses MALDI-MSI to produce multiple images of fingermarks. This can reveal tiny changes in shape, and reveal particles and other elements hidden within the ridges. These . details can be important background information in a criminal . investigation, especially if the suspect's fingerprint is not on the . police database and a positive ID cannot be made. According to The Times, £431,000 ($732,000) has been given by the Home Office to the Police Innovation Fund to forces in Lancashire and Nottingham-shire to introduce faster DNA procedures. So-called Rapid DNA is a process through which DNA profiles can be returned in two hours or less. It is believed to be an important breakthrough for crime scene investigations that could prevent criminals repeat-offending before they are caught. Earlier this year the first application of Rapid DNA took place in Florida using a system known as RapidHIT 200, which can identify suspects in under 90 minutes. Developed by IntegenX in the US and Key Forensic Services in the UK, it can match swabs taken from a crime scene against a national DNA database and produce a match quickly. The portable device, which looks a bit like a printer, can take DNA and produce the result much quicker than modern DNA systems. Most importantly, the device does not require any specific specialist knowledge to be used. All it requires is that someone input a sample of DNA, and it will then cross-reference the sample with the DNA database. It takes about three minutes for a user to input the a swab into the system and begin the analysis. Results on DNA matches will then be produced in less than two hours - and the device can even process seven samples simultaneously. Earlier this year the first application of Rapid DNA took place in Florida using a portable system known as RapidHIT 200 (shown), which can identify suspects in under 90 minutes, developed by IntegenX in the US and Key Forensic Services in the UK . Another system being introduced in the UK is being developed by Sheffield Hallam University and involves in-depth analysis of fingerprints. The technology is known as Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MALDI-MSI). In trials with West Yorkshire police researchers have been taking marks from crime scenes and taking them back to the University’s laboratories for study. From even just partial prints the scientists can find out the complete background of a criminal including their gender and drug use habits. MALDI-MSI, which is a powerful technology normally used to map different molecules within tissue sections, produces multiple images of fingermarks which are made up of materials from the surface of the skin and from gland secretions. Conventionally, fingermarks found at the scene of a crime are lifted after using a powder to enhance them, and are then compared with prints on a police database to identify a suspect. The research team also discovered that the cooking spice, turmeric can be used as the powder to lift fingermarks within the MALDI-MSI process.","UK Home Office has invested £431,000 in development of 'Rapid DNA'

"For the Japanese, a wedding photo album is so passé. Instead, Tokyo's brides are purchasing 3D dolls which are exact replicas of themselves as they appear on their special day. The Clone Factory in Akhibara creates versions of real people and even pets. The high-tech process involves multiple digital SLR cameras taking photos of a person’s or animal’s head from different angles, computers stitching the pictures and data together and a special 3D printer using layers of plaster and ink to mould the 3D sculptures. Uncanny: The clones are printed using layers of ink which harden in the plaster . Priced at £932 (138,000 Japanese yen), the lifelike 3D-printed dolls are unbelievably detailed and immortalise the model. Though the outcome is somewhat eerie, the cloning service is especially popular among Japanese women looking to preserve a special moment in life such as their wedding day. They clone their hair, make-up and even the dress they wore for the complete look. The factory advises people from abroad who fancy owning a clone of themselves to book their session a few days in advance of their trip, as the factory needs this time to prepare. Japanese blogger Danny Choo, who runs . the Culture Japan website, went down to the Factory to try out the . machine and report on the process of being 'cloned'. At the start of the clone doll creation process, Danny was instructed to sit still in a chair in the middle of the room is surrounded by digital SLR cameras - with even some on the ceiling. Multiple cameras then began looping around his head and rays started taking 'slices of measurements'. This process lasted only a few seconds. Write caption here . Cloning their hair style, make-up and clothes (not forgetting face), Japanese women are big customers . Once all the data was prepared, his clone was printed with a ZPrinter 650 using layers of ink which harden in a tray of plaster where the clone is born. When the process is complete, the tray of plaster remains completely . unchanged on the surface. The final product is then covered in a top coat for protection.

"Former Home Secretary David Blunkett has called for tough police action after a violent street fight between rival groups of immigrants. The Labour MP spoke out after Page Hall in Sheffield - part of his constituency - was consumed by violence on Monday, which led to several arrests and one teen needing hospital treatment. He had warned last November that tensions between local people and Roma migrants in the are could escalate into rioting unless action was taken to improve integration. Scroll down for video . Tensions came to a head last night when more than 25 people got involved in the mass disturbance which broke out in the Page Hall area of Sheffield at around 8pm . One teenager was left needing hospital treatment as a result of the violence, which escalated quite quickly . Tensions came to a head when . more than 25 people got involved in the mass disturbance which broke out . in the residential area at around 8pm. A 17-year-old boy suffered a suspected broken arm in the disturbance, which was watched by dozens of concerned residents who poured into the street to watch the clash unfold. Several rang 999 after becoming concerned at the scale of the disorder and many have now called on the authorities to do more to help ease community tension. Mr Blunkett said: 'We were all very apprehensive about the emergence of the long warmer nights, and recognise this was going to be a moment of pressure. 'The police have devoted sufficient manpower and expertise, but what is required is a clear, visible presence in the evening, so there’s no doubt in anyone’s mind about the determination to clamp down on any kind of unacceptable behaviour. 'It’s fine having the numbers but they have to be there at the right time. Those who perpetrate unacceptable behaviour need to understand the police mean business. 'The cause of the problem is believing they can behave in this fashion.' One local said: ‘Members of the existing community are tired and quite frankly frightened at the swiftness of how the situation became enflamed. ‘Council and Government agencies need to be aware of the truth and how the decent residents of this troubled district need support and assurance that they are safe to walk the streets.’ A Section 60 order, which allows officers to stop, search and disperse individuals, was issued in the area to help ease tensions after the rival groups clashed . South Yorkshire Police has not revealed the ethnicity of the 25 people involved in the disturbance but confirmed no arrests have yet been made. A Section 60 order, which allows officers to stop, search and disperse individuals, was issued in the area to help ease tensions. Former Home Secretary David Blunkett warned of rioting in the Page Hall area of Sheffield last November . Inspector Richard Burgess said: ‘There was a police presence in the area throughout the evening to ensure no further issues developed and we will continue to provide a high visibility policing presence in the following days. ‘Officers are thoroughly investigating and are continuing with enquires. We are determined that those responsible for this outbreak of disorder will be held to account for their actions.’ Last year Mr Blunkett warned of potential rioting in the suburb which is plagued by unrest among ethnic groups. The MP, who was born in the city, said the area could ‘explode’ in the same way that street warfare broke out in other northern towns between ethnic groups two decades ago. ‘We have got to change the behaviour and the culture of the incoming community, the Roma community, because there’s going to be an explosion otherwise,’ he said at the time. He also accused the coalition Government of ‘burying their heads in the sands’ over the sheer scale of gipsy arrivals. The Roma population in Sheffield is said to be between 2,000 and 4,000 and growing. More than 1,000 Roma patients are registered to two GP practices alone.","Former Home Secretary speaks out after violent clash on Monday .

"Frank Lampard's new team played its first ever match against St Mirren with their big-name signing 45 miles away in Stoke. The Chelsea legend was supposed to join New York City last month ahead of their inaugural MLS season. But while City's US franchise made their debut in a friendly with the Buddies at the parent club's Football Academy, Lampard was relaxing an hour away down the M6 in a hotel as Manuel Pellegrini's men look to get their season back on track at the Britannia Stadium. David Villa impressed as he scored on his debut for his new club since joining on a free transfer . The World Cup winner leads his side out for New York City's first ever game as a professional club . City have faced the music for keeping Lampard for the rest of the season as they look to retain their Premier League title but officials put a brave face on his absence from last night's inaugural gig for the American offshoot. They were keen to point out that Lampard has been to a number of training sessions as his new pals made the most of City's £200m facilities and added that he had even enjoyed a couple of getting-to-know-you beers. One man who did make his debut on a chilly night in Manchester was former Spain striker David Villa. Villa (centre) breaks the deadlock with a clincial finish against SPL side St Mirren . The twinkle-toed 33-year-old has graced some of the world's biggest stages but this was a low key introduction in front of around 2,000 supporters on the site of an old dyeworks who, given City's difficulties in front of goal, may have wished he was plying his trade across the road. There was an air of inevitability that Villa would break the deadlock and he got his chance on 27 minutes when two Buddies defenders made a hash of clearing a cross from the left. Villa, with the freedom of Manchester, span on the ball before clinically side footing past Marian Kello. New York celebrated their first ever victory, even with a missing Frank Lampard, with a good performance . The ex-Barcelona and Valencia man has Champions League, European Championship and World Cup winners medals in his collection and he will now go down in history as the man who scored the New York City FC's first ever goal thanks to a gift from the Scots. But Villa was given a reminder that the Saints were not here just to make friends moments later when he nutmegged battle-hardened midfielder Jim Goodwin only for the Irishman to return the favour and happily point out that the scores between the pair were now level. Villa exited at the break, one of nine changes while Stevie Thompson came off for the designated visitors. St Mirrens Barry Cuddihy (left) holds off New York's Fran Martinez at the Etihad Campus . Despite the mass substitutions the MLS side found another gear and deservedly doubled their lead when Tony Taylor nipped in behind the Saints defence to emphatically volley a second. That was that and the players exited to the strains of Bruce Springsteen's Born in the USA. Elephant in the room aside, officials will have been pleased with a winning debut. Tony Taylor (right) fires home to seal the win for New York City in Manchester in front of an intrigued crowd . This was not Manhattan this was Manchester but Jason Kreis's men made themselves at home and appeared well-drilled for a hastily put together team. They will be back at the CFA to take on Danish outfit Brondby before kicking off their season against fellow new boys Orlando. Coach Kreis believes Lampard's expected arrival, in June or July, will give his men a shot in the arm as they look to make the play-offs in their debut season. On the evidence of this knockabout, he might be right.

"Secretary of State John Kerry warned graduates of Boston College on Monday that they have doom and destruction to look forward to if they don't take climate change more seriously than previous generations. 'And I know its hard to feel the urgency as we sit here on an absolutely beautiful morning in Boston,' Kerry said, 'you might not see climate change as an immediate threat to your job, your communities or your families. 'But let me tell you, it is.' If the U.S. does not act, 'and it turns out that the critics and the naysayers and the members of the Flat Earth Society - if it turns out that they're wrong, then we are risking nothing less than the future of the entire planet,' Kerry told graduates of the Massachusetts college and their families. Scroll down for video . Secretary of State John Kerry delivered the commencement address at Boston College today Monday, May 19, 2014, in Boston, Massachusetts. Kerry spoke to graduating students about the need for U.S. action on climate change to prevent future calamity both at home and abroad . Kerry told BC's graduating class that climate change is 'an immediate threat to your job, your communities or your families' Kerry graduated from Boston College Law School in 1976. Today he received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the private, Jesuit college as one of its graduation speakers. Also receiving an honorary degree from the college was Boston Celtics alum Bob Cousy. Kerry spoke at both his alma maters' graduation ceremonies this year. Over the weekend he gave the commencement speech at Yale, from where he graduated in 1966 with a degree in political science. At both Yale and Boston college, the Secretary of State spoke about the U.S.' role in helping fix crises abroad. 'Today I promise you that is one of the greatest challenges of America's foreign policy - ensuring that even when its not popular, even when it's not easy, America still lives up to our ideals and our responsibilities to lead,' Kerry told attendees of BC's commencement ceremony on Monday morning. What makes America different from other countries, he said, is the belief that everyone is created equally and with inalienable rights. 'America is - and I say this without chauvinism or any arrogance whatsoever - but America is not just a country like other countries. America is an idea. And we all of us - you - get to fill it out over time,' he said to applause. Kerry told graduates that being a citizen of the United States comes with 'profound responsibility, and in a shrinking world, we can't measure our success just by what we achieve as Americans for Americans, but also by the security and shared prosperity that we build with our partners all over the world.' 'In times of crisis, violence, strife, epidemic, inability, believe me, the world still looks to the United States of America as a partner of first resort, ' Kerry said. 'People aren't worried about our presence, they're worried about our leaving, ' he said, citing the U.S.' humanitarian work in the Philippines, Democratic Republic of Congo and Ethiopia as examples. Kerry, right, received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Boston College president William Leahy, left, during Commencement Exercises this morning. Kerry graduated from Boston College Law School with a degree in law in 1976 . The successful work America has done abroad, he said, should give graduates the courage take on other global challenges such as climate change. 'If we're going to live up to our values, this is a test that we have to meet,' he said, touting his own efforts as a Massachusetts Senator to get legislation passed that addressed the issue. He reminded students of two recent studies completed by the U.N. and retired U.S. military leaders that warned he world of the consequences it will face if countries do not move more quickly to reduce human contributions to climate change. Kerry said that 97 percent of scientists say climate change is 'urgent' because it will lead to food and water insecurity, and 'things will change in a hurry. And they will change for the worse.' Scarcity of resources due to climate change is 'directly' linked to greater conflict and instability throughout the world, the Secretary of State said. 'What's frustrating is that this challenge is not without a solution,' he continued. 'The solution is actually starring us in the face: It is energy policy.' 'Make the right energy policy choices, and America can lead a six trillion dollar market with four billion users today, and grow it to nine billion users in the next 50 years,' he claimed. 'If we make the necessary efforts to address this challenge, and supposing I'm wrong or scientists are wrong - 97 percent of them, all wrong - but supposing they are, what's the worst that can happen? 'We put millions of people to work transitioning our energy, creating new and renewable and alternatives? We make life healthier because we have less particulates in the air and cleaner air and more health? We give ourselves greater security through greater energy independence? That's the downside.' Kerry told the audience to applause that, 'This is not a matter of politics or partisanship. It's a matter of science and stewardship.' 'And it's not a matter of capacity, its a matter of will power,' he added. It's up to the young people sitting in the audience, he said, to save the world from itself. 'This is not a hard choice frankly, but still let me tell you, we need the help of every single one of you to make it,' Kerry said.

But this win – achieved thanks to goals from Leroy Fer and Bobby Zamora and a save-of-the-season contender from Robert Green – was as impressive as it was surprising. And Ramsey said: ‘I thought I deserved the job even before this! ‘This would be some way to go out though. I’m sure I’ll still be involved in some way in developing the club. I’m also academy manager and I’ve got plenty of work on my hands. ‘But I will carry on in this role until told otherwise.’ Ramsey and his team were just arriving at the Stadium of Light when Fernandes, who has ruled out Tim Sherwood for the job, tweeted: ‘Think I have got my dream manager. Not what everyone thinks. Takes a while. Still a bit to go but I’m very happy.

Favourite Laudrup, however, is currently in charge of Qatar side Lekhwiya and it won’t be easy to release the former Swansea manager from his contract. Should that prove the case then Ramsey could be set for an extended stay in the role. He made six changes – including a recall for Rio Ferdinand – and saw his side boss the first half to lead 2-0 at the break. Fer headed a stylish 17th-minute opener from Matt Phillips’s inviting centre and cracked the post soon after. Within 60 seconds of that miss the hosts had the chance to draw level, Jermain Defoe lifting above Green and the crossbar after escaping Stephen Caulker inside the six–yard area. Then came Green’s stupendous save. Adam Johnson loaded a cross from the right, Connor Wickham peeled free and planted a header on goal from point-blank range. Goal! Or so we thought. Green had other ideas, instinctively diverting the ball onto the bar before spinning and shovelling clear as it bounced on the line.

I know there was speculation before the game but we tried to keep ourselves focussed. ‘It was important to win to stay close to teams in that area and it’s given us great belief.’ Gus Poyet, meanwhile, was from pleased with Sunderland’s lacklustre performance, leaving them just two points above the drop zone. He said: ‘You cannot start like that at home in such an important game. ‘It’s a massive missed opportunity to go clear of the bottom three.

"Jurors in the murder trial of a man accused of stabbing a college student to death while he was high on PCP were shown graphic pictures of the bloody crime scene in court yesterday. Julio Miguel Blanco-Garcia is accused of bringing Vanessa Pham's 'young life to a horrific end' when she was trying to do him a good deed after offering to give him and his daughter a ride to hospital. In the second day of the trial in Fairfax County, Virginia, Vanessa's family members cried as Detective Derek Hardy talked about the vast amount of blood in her car. It was also revealed yesterday that immigration officials could have deported Blanco-Garcia months before the brutal slaying after he was held at the Fairfax County jail for a few hours on a public intoxication charge in 2010. Scroll down for video . Caught: Julio Miguel Blanco Garcia, left, is on trial for the 2010 stabbing death of Vanessa Pham, right, after an April 2012 arrest for stealing champagne provided police with matching fingerprints on the murder weapon . Detective Derek Hardy said: 'The most important thing that I found or that I noted was the amount of blood that was inside that car' Clothes: Vanessa Pham's blood-soaked T-Shirt she was wearing on the day she was murdered was also shown to the jury - the slash marks were visible . He was released without being . fingerprinted and before federal immigration officials were able to file . paperwork requesting that he be detained until they could take him into . custody because he had overstayed his visa. Though DNA and fingerprints were . recovered at the scene of the June 27, 2010, crime, it was two . and-a-half years before the Gautemala native was arrested because he was . not in the police database. Prosecutors have asked jurors to find . the day laborer guilty of the first-degree murder of Falls Church . teenager, who was found dead in the driver's seat of her car. Their first witness - the medical . examiner who performed the autopsy on Vanessa - described the 'numerous . sharp, force injuries' from the incise wounds and added that six stab . wounds were found in the lung alone. The murder weapon was shown in court - . which had dried blood on it - as well as the blood-soaked T-shirt and . blood-splattered car. The medical examiner said Vanessa was alive when the wounds were inflicted and she would have felt great pain, NBC reports. Evidence: The blade from the knife used to stab Vanessa Pham 13 times in the seat of her car in June 2010 . Police also found two diaper cloths in the car: One clean in the back and one up front bloodied from Vanessa's wounds . Accused: Julio Miguel Blanco-Garcia arrives at court for the second day of his hearing yesterday, he has pleaded not guilty . Outside of the courtroom the disclosure that immigration officials previously tried to take him into custody have raised questions about whether local and . federal policies let him slip through the cracks. U.S. Immigration and Customs . Enforcement was notified of Blanco-Garcia’s 2010 misdemeanor for public . intoxication and planned to file paperwork to take custody of him. The Falls Church teenager was found dead in the driver's seat of her car . Before they could do this, he was released by local authorities on personal recognizance before he could be fingerprinted based on the low-level nature of the charge. Garcia was finally taken into custody when he was arrested for stealing three bottles of Moet and Chandon from a grocery store. Bob Dane, spokesman for the Federation . for American Immigration Reform, told the Washington Times: 'We’re . looking into a black hole here as part of the procedure and it . should be a wake-up call for the public to ask how Fairfax County . handles illegal aliens and what they do when ICE doesn’t send the paddy . wagon.'. Blanco-Garcia denies the charge of . Miss Pham's premeditated murder, but has admitted knifing her to death . in a drug-fueled fury after he begged her to drive him and his daughter . to hospital. 'This is not a . case that is about who,' defense attorney Alberto Salvado said in his . opening statement on Monday, according to the Washington Post. 'This is a . case about why. It is a perfect storm of tragedy.' For two-and-a-half years Vanessa's killing remained one of the area's most notorious unsolved murders. Despite . finding the murder weapon with fingerprints under the driver's seat, . the DNA evidence didn't match anyone in the police database. A . break in the case came only in April 2012 when Julio Miguel Blanco . Garcia was arrested for stealing three bottles of Moet & Chandon . champagne from a McLean, Virginia shop. Initially, . his lawyers tried to get the case dismissed, claiming that the media's . coverage of the investigation tainted their client's ability to receive a . fair trial since nearly all of the evidence in the case was released . before a jury was selected. Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Marum Roush dismissed that claim last week, saying all of the evidence reported in The Washington Post would come out in trial and that jury members could set aside what they learned in the press. Taken: Pham was home for the summer, looking forward to a new babysitting job and a visit from her boyfriend when she was stabbed to death while giving Blanco Garcia a ride . Vanessa had just returned home for the summer after her first year studying fashion design at the Savannah College of Art and Design. She was living with her mother at their apartment in Falls Church, and had just landed a babysitting gig for the summer the same day she was killed. The 19-year-old was also looking forward to a visit from her boyfriend Aaron Apsley who lived in Ohio. Around 2:45pm she decided to go to the Fairfax Plaza Shopping Center to get her eyebrows done at JD Nail Salon. It was while leaving the salon that she first encountered Blanco Garcia, standing outside holding his one-year-old daughter. Garcia started his day by going into Washington, D.C. with his daughter to buy $400 dollars of PCP. When he got home he smoked three cigarettes dipped in liquid PCP before going to the mall with his daughter. According . to court documents, by the time he approached Vanessa outside the mall, he . was having a 'severe PCP intoxication' and asked the young woman to . take him and his daughter to the hospital. Surveillance footage subsequently shows Pham's white Scion exiting the parking lot. Taken for a ride: Pham agreed to take Blanco Garcia and his one-year-old daughter to the hospital, but was found less than a mile away stabbed to death in her crashed car . According to an account given to police by Blanco Garcia, Vanessa accidentally took a wrong turn and he overreacted. 'Vanessa did nothing wrong,' a detective paraphrased Blanco Garcia in a report made after his arrest. At . this point, Blanco Garcia was hallucinating and believed the teen was . going to harm his daughter or call the police, so he acted. He . took out a butcher's knife from his backpack and stabbed the girl 13 . times which caused her to lose control of the vehicle and crash into a . ravine on the side of the road. Blanco Garcia ditched the knife and left Vanessa to die, fleeing from the vehicle with his daughter through the sunroof. A . driver spotted the car at 3:34pm, less than half a mile from the mall . and called police. When police arrived, they found Vanessa belted into her . seat and covered in blood with one wheel of the car still spinning. But police were stumped when it came to finding the suspect. Severely intoxicated: Blanco Garcia has spent his day traveling into Washington D.C. to buy $400 dollars of PCP with his daughter, and had smoked three cigarettes dipped in the drugs before going to the shopping center . Even though the knife was left in the car, the DNA evidence produced no matches in the police database. Investigators were certain the killer was a stranger since they had no reason to believe the pretty student had any enemies or was in any trouble. They canvassed the area around the mall and collected DNA from Vanessa's friends and family, local sex offenders and homeless people around the mall, but again, no matches. Vanessa's story was even highlighted on TV show 'America's Most Wanted' to no avail. It wasn't until almost two years later that Blanco Garcia was arrested for stealing two bottles of Moet & Chandon champagne at a grocery store in McLean, Virginia. Even then, it took police until last December 10 to make the connection with his prints. '[Blanco Garcia] was arrested in April for larceny of champagne. Imagine that!' wrote Fairfax County police detective Robert Bond in an email that day. A few days later Blanco Garcia was arrested at his job site in Vienna, Virginia. He said he never told anyone about the killing. A search of Blanco Garcia's computer showed that he tracked news of the investigation on his computer.","Vanessa Pham, 19, was discovered in the driver's seat of her crashed car on June 27, 2010 with 13 stab wounds .

"Derby County may have introduced a no-swearing protocol, but Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe must surely have had a few expletives running through his mind, if not passing his lips, as his side twice squandered the lead in their top-of-the-table draw. Bournemouth dropped to second and Derby third as both sides missed the chance to move three points clear - allowing Middlesbrough to go top with a 2-1 win at Blackpool - as Tom Ince cancelled out Matt Ritchie’s opener and Darren Bent equalised after Callum Wilson sent the home side ahead again. Derby manager Steve McClaren wants his players and staff to stop swearing to concentrate them in matches, but in one so frenetic that is no mean feat. Darren Bent fires home emphatically from close range to ensure a share of the spoils for Derby . The experienced striker wheels away in celebration after scoring his fourth goal since joining the Rams . Matt Ritchie fired home from close range to give Bournemouth the lead after 12 minutes .

Did they manage to maintain it during this one? ’If you heard me at half-time, no,’ McClaren revealed afterwards. This was a proper top versus second match. One between a clash of philosophies; arguably the league’s most attractive yet stringent side, Bournemouth, and the big names and spending might of Derby. The south coast club were hosting in their 12,000 capacity Dean Court ground. If the game were at Derby’s iPro Stadium it would’ve been full to it’s 33,000 maximum. Pure football struck first when the home side took the lead in only the 12th minute with a wonderfully constructed move. Yann Kermorgant cushioned a cross from Wilson into the path of Ritchie and the midfielder took a touch before finishing from eight yards out. The winger celebrates after giving the Cherries the lead against their promotion rivals . Tom Ince hit a precise left-footed drive to get Derby back on level terms on the half-hour mark . The 23-year-old - on loan from Premier League outfit Hull - wheels away in celebration after making it 1-1 . Howe was priced out of a January move for Birmingham’s exciting winger Demarai Gray despite five bids and they signed no one to reinforce their promotion push. Conversely, Derby shelled out on loan moves for Bent from Aston Villa and Hull’s Ince and it was those two who combined for their equaliser after half-an-hour. Bent, who came on in the 15th minute when top-scorer Chris Martin hobbled off, did well down the right flank and passed to Ince. With blistering pace he beat a man before burying a left-footed shot into the bottom right corner. But the home side scored a minute before the break, when top-scorer Wilson fired into the top left corner from a tight angle on the right. Howe broke the bank - in Bournemouth terms - to sign Wilson for a club record £3million from Coventry last summer. That goal was the 22-year-old’s 18th of the season in all competitions. But Derby were able to call on £65,000-per-week Bent, who has commanded almost £50m in transfer fees during his career, to fire them level from close range in the 68th minute. Callum Wilson's right-footed shot put Bournemouth back in front just before half-time . The Cherries top scorer (second right) celebrates scoring his 18th goal of the season . Howe said: ’For me names of other teams don't scare me in the sense of where they’ve been or the sides they’ve played for. I would back my players to go toe-to-toe with anyone. We’re where we are on right.’ Bent had a half-volley saved at the near post by Artur Boruc, who also fumbled but kept out Will Hughes’ effort and Wilson twice went close in the first half. McClaren and his players wouldn’t like to admit it out loud, but what an eff-ing game.","Matt Ritchie gave the hosts the lead after just 12 minutes .

"If this is to be Mark Warburton’s final season at Griffin Park then he won’t want any off the field issues derailing their push for promotion. Reports that Brentford are lining up a new manager for next season regardless of if they are promoted to the Premier League or still in the Championship are understood to have hurt Warburton and he is believed to be keen to stay at the club - but feels he is being forced out. Brentford refused to deny that they had been talking to potential replacements for Warburton in a statement but said the 52-year-old remained their manager. Ighalo celebrates a vital three points in the quest for promotion following his late winner . And if Warburton was looking for a response then he got one from his players, even if they fell to a late defeat to promotion rivals Watford. He said: ‘I thought we showed great character and I’m really disappointed for the players to put in that kind of shift and I thought they deserved more. ‘It has been a difficult day and the players have been outstanding. I can’t speak highly enough of them. They work hard every day and they are where they are because they deserve to be there. ‘Those players deserve my focus and there is nothing else than looking after that group of players.

The board made the statement and it would be disrespectful to these players to say anything else. Andre Gray gave Brentford the lead early in the second half after Brentford had been reduced to 10 men before half time but Watford hit back through a Odion Ighalo double. It took Brentford less than a minute to show their intent in this game as Jonathan Douglas headed over the bar from a Jota cross as the home side went on the attack from the start. Top scorer Gray then saw his attempt smothered by Watford keeper Heurelho Gomes. Watford took their time to get into the game, but Troy Deeney posed a threat and had a decent effort from the edge of the box. Ben Watson then had an even better shot from 25 yards out but Brentford keeper David Button got down well to his right to tip the ball round the post. Deeney then got himself in another good position in the box, but took one touch too many allowing James Tarkowski to make a vital interception. Warburton is mobbed by his players as the home club go 1-0 up at Griffin Park . Gray races towards Brentford manager Mark Warburton to celebrate his opener against Watford . Watford continued the pile on the pressure with Fernando Forestieri going close with a curling shot from the edge of the area. If Brentford thought they were under pressure with 11 men then things got worse just before half time when left back Bidwell was shown a straight red card for a challenge on Miguel Layun. Bidwell’s challenge was late but the Mexico international seemed to make a meal of it and referee Keith Stroud was quick to dismiss the Brentford defender. But Brentford did not let being a man down affect them as they took the lead early in the second half through Gray. Brentford's Jake Bidwell is shown the red card as they take on fellow promotion hopefuls Watford . Heurelho Gomes gets down well to deny Brentford attacker Gray during the first half at Griffin Park . Gray met Button’s long clearance brilliantly and rifled a shot past Gomes at his near post, and if there was any doubt about how the players felt about Warburton, then they made it clear by running over to the touchline to celebrate with their manager. Minutes later, Button maintained Brentford’s lead when he saved Deeney’s tame penalty after Jonathan Douglas’ handball. But he could not prevent Ighalo from levelling with a close range header from Juan Carlos Paredes’ cross as Watford made the extra man count. It was no more than Watford deserved and they were keen to make their man advantage count in the final 20 minutes. Warburton gives the Brentford fans the thumbs up after a day of scrutiny at the club . Brentford striker Gray gestures for a penalty as the ball spins away from his grasp at Griffin Park . First Deeney’s shot was brilliantly saved by Button and then Ighalo’s effort was also kept out by the Bees keeper. Forestieri then saw his effort come back off the post after a well worked free kick. But eventually the pressure told as Watford snatched the winner deep into stoppage time when Ighalo turned in substitute Matej Vydra’s cross from six yards out. It was a blow for Warburton and Brentford but they are still in the hunt for promotion at the end of the season as are Watford who strengthened their position in the top six. Watford manager Slavisa Jokanovic said: ‘Ighalo is in very good form at the moment. He played very well and if he has the chances he normally puts them in the net.’ Stuart Dallas takes on Watford's Juan Carlos Parades during the second half at Griffin Park .","Odion Ighalo scored an injury time goal to hand Watford all three points .

"NHS England bosses insist that safeguards have been put in place to keep personal data safe, despite concerns from doctors and nurses . Health officials are to go ahead with a controversial plan to harvest the personal data of millions of NHS patients despite widespread concerns. A pilot scheme involving 265 GP surgeries and 1.7million patients will see confidential medical information put on a giant computer database, it emerged last night. The data, which includes childhood illnesses as well as recent conditions, will be uploaded unless a patient specifically opts out. The highly controversial project was meant to begin last spring but officials were forced to postpone it following opposition from senior GPs and privacy campaigners. Bosses at NHS England insist that over the past six months they have ‘listened carefully’ to the concerns of doctors and patients, and put in place safeguards to prevent data falling into the wrong hands. But experts say the safeguards remain unclear and point out that the NHS has an abysmal reputation for losing patients’ medical data. NHS England, backed by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, insists the data is hugely valuable and will identify poor care and possibly help find new cures. Critics warn it could fall into the hands of hackers – or insurance firms who will use it to drive up premiums for patients with certain conditions. There have been repeated complaints that information about how to opt out has been unclear. Despite this, the pilot schemes will launch in six Clinical Commissioning Groups local GP-led organisations – spanning West Hampshire, Blackburn and Darwen in Lancashire, Leeds and Somerset. They will cover up to 265 surgeries and, given an average practice size of 6,500, nearly 1.7million patients. Unless patients specifically opt out in writing or by word of mouth to their GP, their data will be uploaded automatically. The information will include a patient’s date of birth, NHS number and postcode – but not their name. However, experts say it would be very easy for hackers or private organisations to identify patients from the information stored. Mr Hunt has promised that the data would not be shared with insurance firms for purely commercial reasons. But campaigners pointed out that a number of insurers also carry out research and analysis, so could use this to obtain information which could be used it to drive up premiums. Over the next few weeks doctors in the pilot areas will contact patients by text, email or letter alerting them to the Care.data scheme and advising how they opt out. NHS England does not yet know when the full project will begin but it is likely to be within months. Last February – a month before the scheme was due to get under way – it called a temporary halt following fierce opposition from doctors and patients. Critics have warned that patients' data could fall into the hands of insurance companies, who will use it to drive up premiums, or could be accessed by hackers . Both the British Medical Association and the Royal College of GPs said patients had not been given enough information as to how they could opt out. A number of GPs were so opposed they automatically withdrew the thousands of patients on their books – and in so doing risking their surgeries being shut down. They included Dr Gordon Gancz, from Oxford, who received a threatening letter from NHS England informing him his actions were in breach of his contract . Mr Hunt said in March that the database would be invaluable for identifying poor care and finding new treatments. ‘This is so important scientifically and this is going to save so many lives that it’s really important that we carry the public with us,’ he said. But the NHS has an appalling reputation for mislaying data. Figures show there have been 2.1million breaches since 2011. These include computers containing medical records mistakenly being sold on eBay by hospital trusts and files being dumped in recycling bins. Last night Roger Goss of Patient Concern said: ‘If you have a mental health condition – for example depression – there is the potential for this to become public knowledge. 'It could be hugely damaging for your reputation. Supposing you are a woman who had an abortion – if that got out it could destroy your career or relationship.’ Phil Booth, of the campaign group Med Confidential said: ‘The basis of the programme is unchanged – identifiable medical information will be extracted from the GP record of every man, woman and child in England. 'This this data will be centralised and made available in various forms to an open-ended array of organisations and companies for ill-defined purposes. ‘It’s all very well to make promises, but patients must be able to trust those promises are true. NHS England cannot fudge what it says to doctors and patients, or it risks another crisis of confidence. We look forward to reading what NHS England are actually proposing.’ Tim Kelsey, NHS England national director for patients and information, said: ‘There are huge benefits to be had from this programme and this is our opportunity to make sure we get it absolutely right. ‘This is another step on the way to creating a more substantial picture of our nation’s health so we can improve care for patients.’","Patients' date of birth, NHS number and postcode to be uploaded to system .

"Cancer-survivor Jonas Gutierrez has returned to Argentina and looks to have played his last game for Newcastle United. Sportsmail understands the 31-year-old is in talks with Velez Sarsfield and, with his Magpie contract set to expire in the summer, it is unlikely he will be afforded a final appearance for the club he has served since 2008. Gutierrez has been building fitness with Newcastle's Under-21s since returning to Tyneside in December having been given the all-clear from testicular cancer. Jonas Gutierrez winds up a strike during the Newcastle U21 side's clash with West Brom last Monday . Jonas Gutierrez brings the ball forward for Newcastle's Under 21 side in a game against Bolton in January . The former Argentina international was first diagnosed in September, 2013. He had a testicle removed and returned to Premier League action. However, the cancer returned last summer and Gutierrez underwent a course of chemotherapy and beat the illness for a second time. Newcastle fans had hoped to see the popular winger make a farewell outing at St James' Park, and Gutierrez told Sportsmail last month: 'Yes, I have played in a World Cup, but if I play again for Newcastle then that will be the best moment of my career. Former Mallorca man Gutierrez lost all of his hair after undergoing chemotherapy for testicular cancer . A huge screen at St James' Park shows a 'United for Jonas' message during Newcastle's win over Liverpool . Ex-Argentina midfielder Gutierrez drives forward during his country's World Cup clash with Mexico in 2010 . 'To get back after the cancer and chemotherapy, to put all of that behind me, would be a huge moment for me. It would be emotional. 'If I come back and play for Newcastle then for me it will be the best.' Gutierrez made his professional debut with Velez as an 18-year-old in 2001 and trained with the club last autumn as he began his comeback bid. Should talks prove successful then his Newcastle career will be over after 194 appearances and 11 goals, denying him the chance of an emotional cameo for the club.","Jonas Gutierrez is in talks with Velez Sarsfield .

"Sky Sports secured five of seven match packages offered up by the Premier League to BT Sport's two as the broadcasters contributed to a record £5.136billion rights deal, announced on Tuesday. Here Sportsmail's Nick Harris answers all the big questions surrounding the deal  - who won what and what it means for clubs, fans and English football as a whole. Q: So what was the big deal about Tuesday's announcement? A: That it really was a big deal. Much bigger than anyone expected. Sky and BT currently pay £3.018bn to show all the available live Premier League games between them each season, until the end of 2015-16. Sky Sports sealed five of seven Premier League match packages to cover the likes of Harry Kane from 2016 . Sky and BT Sport contributed to a record £5.136billion rights deal that is a 70 per cent increase on last deal . But in a move that shocked everyone, the value of rights has soared AGAIN, and the same two broadcasters will be paying £5.136bn for the three-year period 2016-19. That’s a rise of more than 70 per cent. Q: Who got what, and what did they pay? A: Sky have won the rights to five packages, or 126 games per season (up from 116 now), and will continue to show the major games each week in the 4pm Sunday slot, as well as Monday night football, occasional games on Friday nights, plus Saturday lunchtime and Sunday afternoon games. BT will show 42 games per season (up from 38), at Saturday tea-time and in midweek. Sky will pay £1.392bn per season or £4.176bn in total, which works out at a staggering £11.05m per game, up from the £6.6m they pay now. BT will pay £320m a season, or £960m in total, or £7.6m a game, up from £6.5m a game now. Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore announced the staggering deal on Tuesday . Scudamore told media Sky Sports' coverage will rise from 116 to 126 games a season and BT will show four more than their current 38 matches . Q: How will that affect fans who currently subscribe to their services? A: BT were always planning to introduce an element of pay-per-view from next season anyway as they start to show Champions League and Europa League games exclusively. Pricing plans are not available yet. Sky’s extra expenditure would most naturally come from an increase in monthly cost, of perhaps between £9 and £12 for Sky Sports. But a Sky spokesman said on Tuesday night: ‘The company will work hard to minimise the impact of higher rights costs on customers, with the majority of the funding coming through substantial additional savings to be delivered by efficiency plans.’ Sky Sports pundits Graeme Souness (left) and Thierry Henry analyse a recent match - the new deal means their broadcaster will be showing 126 games per season . Q: What does that mean in English? A: Probably a price rise anyway, of unconfirmed amounts, depending on how many ‘efficiency’ savings they make, presumably cutbacks on other programming or job cuts. Q: What will this mean for clubs in terms of extra income? A: As things stand the Premier League makes around £5.9billion for the three-year cycle 2013-16 from live UK rights (£3.018bn), all overseas rights combined (£2.23bn), UK highlights (MOTD, £170m) and a variety of clip rights, near-live rights and sponsorship income, for example from title sponsor Barclays. From 2016-17, the live UK rights along will jump to £5.136bn alone, with foreign rights expected to rise to around £3bn, and with all the other bits and pieces, the total pot should grow from £5.9bn over three years to around £8.8bn. BT Sport's (from left) Jake Humphrey and pundits Michael Owen, Steve McManaman and David James will show Champions League and Europa League games exclusively from next season . Q: So what does that mean in cold hard cash for the clubs? A: Put it like this: the bottom club last season made £62m from central funds and the highest earning club, Liverpool, earned £97.5m. From 2016-17, the bottom club can expect to earn around £99m a season and the highest earning club around £156m. This might be a bit lower if the overseas rights don’t climb as high as £3bn. Or it could be more, in which case the clubs’ income could rise even higher. Q: What about the fans? A: You mean the customers? Certainly the clubs will have no excuse whatsoever to start using some of this extraordinary extra money to make cuts to ticket prices that are the most expensive in world club football. Premier League CEO Richard Scudamore insists he will do what he can to encourage this, but he ultimately cannot force such cuts. Time will tell.","Sky Sports will have  five of seven Premier League match packages .
Channel got packages A, C, D, E, which is 126 games a season .
BT Sport's B and F packages include 28 Saturday 5.30pm games .
The £5.136bn deal total means games average £10.2m each .
Sky is paying a staggering £11.05m per match to BT's £7.6m .

"Leicester City manager Nigel Pearson was all smiles as he shook hands with club owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha on Tuesday night. The duo were pictured giving each other a friendly greeting as they took their seats in the Emirates stands ahead of Leicester’s clash with Arsenal. Leicester City owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha shakes hands with manager Nigel Pearson at the Emirates . The pair share a smile and a word as they put last weekend's issues behind them on Tuesday night . It was Pearson’s first stadium appearance since a weekend from hell for the 51-year-old who held on to his job by the skin of his teeth before swerving an FA charge. Few could imagine that Pearson would still be in charge after the 51-year-old manager appeared to grab the throat of McArthur during Crystal Palace’s 1-0 win at the King Power Stadium on Saturday. Pearson laughed off his touchline scuffle with Palace's record signing McArthur, who almost joined Leicester when leaving Wigan last summer. Leicester boss Pearson escaped punishment from the FA for grabbing James McArhur by the throat . Pearson proceeded to hold on to the Crystal Palace midfielder's top and would not let go . BBC Match of the Day host Gary Linekar said the incident between Pearson and McArthur was 'strange' Pearson claimed after the defeat to Palace that he could ‘look after himself’, but Match of the Day host Gary Lineker hinted on Twitter that he had been sacked. Former Leicester legend Lineker hinted that Pearson had been sacked by one member of the Srivaddhanaprabha family on Sunday night before being reinstated by another. But there was clearly no hard feelings on show on Tuesday as the duo watched Leicester take on Arsenal. Pearson was rumoured to have been sacked on Sunday night as his side sit bottom of the Premier League . But at half-time Lineker again took to twitter to have a dig at Pearson as Leicester went in at the break 2-0 down. He tweeted: 'Leicester are 2 down at Arsenal. Pearson needs to get a grip of his players at halftime.' Match of the Day presented Lineker yet again has a dig at the Leicester City manager . As he so often does Pearson made his way down to the touchline area to watch the second half of the match. And he was rewarded for his presence as club record signing Andrej Kramaric gave the Foxes a glimmer of hope against Arsene Wenger's side. The Croatian attacker, who cost Pearson £9.5million in January, found the bottom left hand corner of David Ospina's goal to give the relegation threatened Foxes a way back into the game. Pearson made his way down to the touchline at half time as he so often does . by SAMI MOKBEL . All eyes were on Leicester manager Nigel Pearson last night after his rather controversial antics on the touchline against Crystal Palace on Saturday. Could he keep his hands to himself at the Emirates Stadium? Or, at the very least, not throttle an opposition player's throat? 0-45mins - The Foxes boss started the clash in the comfort of the directors box, flanked by assistant manager Steve Walsh, leaving coach Craig Shakespeare to control the technical area. Despite the furore surrounding his confrontation with Crystal Palace midfielder James McArthur and the subsequent speculation about his job, Pearson seemed in chirpy mood, greeting well wishers with smiles and hand shakes. His mood would have changed no doubt after watching an unmarked Laurent Koscielny give Arsenal the lead. He didn't emerge until first half injury time, by which time his side were 2-0 down. His first task was to have debrief with Shakespeare. 46-56mins - He did take his place on the bench at the start of the second half - and it took just 70 seconds for Pearson to rise to his feet to hold another conference with Shakespeare before sitting down, cross armed and cross legged again. His subdued demeanour continued well into the second period, though he did smack his hands together in anger after Matty James failed to control with a clear run at goal awaiting him. 59mins - Finally some sign of life as he strides to the touchline to console Matt Upson who is forced off with an injury. Two minutes later he's on his feet again, this time celebrating Andrej Kramaric's goal with clenched fists. He stays stood in his technical area in the aftermath - but with his hands firmly in his pocket. Better safe than sorry. It's not long before he finds his seat again, though. 77mins - A tad more movement from Pearson as he gives Leonardo Ulloa instructions before his introductions, his conversation with the striker is interrupted though as Kramaric storms through one-on-one with David Ospina. The forward is foiled by the Gunners keeper, prompting a theatric arm waving and jumping from Pearson, About as animated he's been so far. 82mins - Having spent most of the night sitting down, Pearson - like his players - can smell Arsenal blood as he stays on his feet, right on the edge of his technical area for the final minutes of the encounter. He gives David Nugent a quick pep talk before throwing the striker on in search of an equaliser. But his efforts to cajole Leicester players are in vain, though he waits to greet every single one of his players as they walk off before giving the visiting fans a wave. A final goodbye, perhaps?

"Jamie Carragher and Co have reacted to the news of the staggering £5.136billion Premier League TV rights deal. The Sportsmail columnist says 'that's his coaching badges out of the window for a few years' now, with fellow colleague Gary Neville delighted with the outcome for Sky - who secured five out of the seven package deals - but says sensible ticket pricing must now be enforced and grass roots football must also benefit greatly from this.

We have already done that and I am sure other clubs will do the same. 'It is a market situation. Football has a huge global attraction and we can attract that sort of money because we can offer the product. It is a bit over the top to call it obscene.

"They could be strike partners for England next month and, at this rate, for some years to come. On Tuesday night, however, Daniel Sturridge and Harry Kane found themselves on opposing teams with very different goals in mind. The shootout between two of England's most prolific marksmen became a focal point for what was otherwise a breathless, exhilarating encounter featuring two teams built to attack. Roy Hodgson will have been as interested a spectator as anyone as he weighs up his options for the forthcoming Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley on March 27 and the friendly with Italy four days later. Harry Kane re-arranged his feet brilliantly to take Erik Lamela’s pass and score in the 26th minute . Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet looks on as Spurs striker Kane makes it 1-1 at Anfield . The Tottenham forward wheels away to celebrate after scoring his 23rd goal in all competitions this season . Kane celebrates with team-mate Ryan Mason in front of the Spurs support following his first-half equaliser . Kane arrived on Merseyside on Tuesday night having just upstaged two of his rivals for an England place; 10 days earlier he had scored twice at the Hawthorns to overshadow West Brom's Saido Berahino. Then on Saturday, of course, came that double in the North London derby at White Hart Lane to eclipse Danny Welbeck and give Spurs a memorable victory over Arsenal. Tuesday night was arguably an even tougher proposition. Sturridge might have missed the majority of the season with a combination of thigh and calf injuries, but he remains England's pre-eminent striker and the one most likely to be first on Roy Hodgson's teamsheet when fully fit. Coincidentally, the two men had an identical record of 15 goals from their last 20 Premier League starts. Kane got another one on Tuesday night and has now scored all of his 13 Premier League goals since November, while Sturridge's injury issues inevitably meant that his record stretched back well into last season when he formed a prolific partnership with Luis Suarez. Daniel Sturridge wins a penalty for Liverpool following a clumsy challenge from Danny Rose . Steven Gerrard stepped up to convert the resulting penalty during a frantic contest at Anfield . In fact, Tuesday night was his first start since last August and a 3-0 win over Tottenham at a time when Kane was only considered good enough for the substitutes' bench. How things have changed. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has no doubt that Kane is worthy of his first senior England call-up after eight goals in 10 internationals for the Under-21s, but had said on the eve of this game that 'as an English striker there's no-one better than' Sturridge. 'For me, Daniel clearly has everything as a top European striker,' Rodgers said before kick-off last night. 'If we can get him on the field regularly now he will show that. Sturridge was making his first start for Liverpool since last August following an injury-ravaged season . 'But it's brilliant for young Harry Kane seeing him as a young player coming through the system. He's a terrific talent and it shows you that, given the opportunity, a homegrown player can come in and do very well. I'm delighted to see him do that and I hope it will continue after tonight.' It's hard to see how Hodgson can ignore Kane now. The Tottenham man continued his remarkable run of form by scoring the first-half equaliser that takes his total in all competitions to 23 by mid January. No Premier League striker has scored more. It was another well-taken goal by the 21-year-old who managed to re-arrange his feet to take Erik Lamela's pass in the 26th minute when Mamadou Sakho was falling over his. Reds keeper Mignolet does well to thwart a goal-bound effort from Kane during the second-half . Once again, Kane went for power rather than precision, and Simon Mignolet just couldn't keep it out. He then helped set up Tottenham's second equaliser for Moussa Dembele and, on that basis, you would have to say that he just about shaded the duel with Sturridge. The Liverpool striker is not one to be easily outdone, however. In his defence, Sturridge is getting back to full fitness. He was still enough of a handful to win the penalty that enabled Steven Gerrard to restore Liverpool's lead early in the second half when Sturridge's jinking run invited a clumsy challenge from Danny Rose. England manager Roy Hodgson (centre) will have been watching Sturridge and Kane closely at Anfield as he weighs up his options for the forthcoming Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania in March . Both he and Kane are clearly high on confidence. Kane tried his luck with an effort from the half way line in the first half, while Sturridge sent an audacious backheel against the post. Hugo Lloris made two saves from Sturridge in the early stages and was relieved to see Eric Dier recover to deny the former Chelsea striker with a magnificent block after Nabil Bentaleb contributed to a catalogue of defensive errors by Tottenham with an awful pass. Dier then produced another fantastic tackle on Sturridge in the second half when Liverpool fans were screaming for a second penalty. By the end, they had to be happy with a point. Kane and Sturridge had both made theirs.","Liverpool defeated Tottenham 3-2 in a breathless encounter at Anfield .

"It's the smile Liverpool  have been waiting for since August, but Mario Balotelli's delighted post-match grin has been one Reds supporters will finally be glad to see. The Italian scored his first Premier League goal for the club after coming off the bench to dramatically snatch a late winner in the 3-2 win over Tottenham at Anfield. Balotelli's goal came in a pulsating match between the clubs and could yet prove huge at the end of the season with both teams fighting to reach the top four and a Champions League place that goes with it.

It’s been 850 playing minutes since Balotelli's last Premier League goal against Wigan on 28 November 2012. The striker went 17 games without scoring. In those 17 games, he fired in 19 shots on target, 17 shots off target and had 14 blocked. The striker showed little emotion in his celebration after tapping home Adam Lallana's cross from close range, and even at the final whistle he refused to acknowledge the Kop and was the first Liverpool player to depart Anfield - with manager Brendan Rodgers also leaving early to catch a flight. Balotelli did later show his delight and gratitude to fans after posting on social media. 'Great game guys!!!', Balotelli said on Instagram. 'This smile is ONLY for those that always believe and support me. Thank you and forza Liverpool. But now head down and keep working hard. Tonight is past.' Speaking in the absence of manager Brendan Rodgers, who had to catch a flight, assistant boss Colin Pascoe paid tribute to the Italian, who has struggled to settle back in English football since joining Liverpool for £16million last summer. ‘He is immensely happy,’ said Pascoe. ‘To get a winner at Anfield, I am sure he is happy. ‘It was great movement from Mario in the six-yard box. I hope it can be a springboard, he is training hard. The last couple of weeks he’s been ill and had gashes on his feet so couldn’t get his boots on.

"Paul Lambert insists he is '100 per cent' certain Aston Villa will stay up despite recording a tenth match without a Premier League victory to slide into the relegation zone. Villa slumped to a 2-0 defeat at Hull, courtesy of goals from Nikica Jelavic and Dame N'Doye, in a hugely important game at the foot of the table, prompting travelling fans to unfurl a banner reading 'Lambert Out' and chanting for their manager's head. A small crowd waited by the team bus after the final whistle to confront the squad. It was the 15th Premier League game this season Villa have failed to score and, with 13 matches to go, intensifies genuine fears the club could fall into the Championship. Aston Villa fans make their feelings known at the KC Stadium as a 'Lambert out' banner is unveiled . Nikica Jelavic scores the opener as his shot deflects off Ciaran Clark and loops over Villa keeper Brad Guzan . Dame N'Doye runs away in celebration after scoring for his Hull side to secure the three points against Villa . Lambert insisted that would not happen, but admitted his ambitions to play possession-based football would be abandoned in a bid to collect points by any means. He told each of his players 'make sure you don't buckle for your own career'. Lambert said: 'I probably can't describe how low I feel. It's as flat as you can get (in the dressing room). I've just told the players there are 13 cup finals. We have to win them. There are a few teams in it who will fight to stay in the league. You have to make sure you're out of that bottom three. No matter what you do. 'There have been moments before when it's been hard. You can either meet it head on or you buckle under it.

I can't do nothing about it, the fans pay good money. Whether that goes against the lads, I hope not.

"Real Madrid's £328million plans to redevelop their Santiago Bernabéu  have yet another snag after a ruling by the High Court of Madrid overturned the approval of plans that included updates to the stadium. Club president Florentino Perez revealed the vision for the new  Bernabeu to be 'the best stadium in the world' last January along with mock-ups for the 400million euro works. The three-year project would include a revamped exterior, a retractable roof and increase its capacity to 85,454 to 90,000, along with a hotel and shopping centre complex alongside, but Tuesday's ruling has put a spanner in the works. Real Madrid's £328million plans to redevelop their Santiago Bernabeu stadium have been stalled again . The design would include a revamped exterior, a retractable roof and increase capacity to 85,454 to 90,000 . 'The High Court of Madrid has overturned the Agreement from 15 November 2012, issued by the Community of Madrid's Governing Council, which approved the Specific Modification of the Madrid General Development Plan, a decision that affects the Santiago Bernabéu,' a statement on the Real Madrid website read. 'Following this ruling, Real Madrid C. F. will work with the City Council and the Community of Madrid to address those aspects that require attention in order to make the Santiago Bernabéu reform project viable.' It's another blow to Real this week after Spanish paper AS labelled the club as in crisis with Perez reportedly demanding his players 'return to the Madrid you were before.' Carlo Ancelotti's side were given a 4-0 lesson at rival Atletico Madrid's Vicente Calderon on Saturday, with goals from Tiago Mendes, Saul Niguez, Antoine Griezmann and Mario Mandzukic. A club statement said Real would 'address those aspects that require attention in order to make the Santiago Bernabeu reform project viable after the High Courts overturning of development approval . Perez said at the unveiling of the plans in January last year: 'It's time to face another challenge has come, we want to make the Santiago Bernabeu is the best stadium in the world. 'Our commitment is to continue increasing the heritage of our club, thus gain in economic strength, so we can continue to lead in an environment of increasing competition. 'We believe in a project that will enhance our image, brand and city that we also feel proud of.' The project was previously stalled in August due to European Commission investigation into allegations of illegal state aid. The court statement read: 'The court is adopting the (suspension) measure due to the launching of a process by the European Commission relating to possible state aid given to Real Madrid.' Volkwin Marg, owner of GMP, who will lead the project, said: '(We aim to) transform the Bernabeu into the most advanced and developed stadium of the 21st century. This building is undoubtedly the most important project of our careers.'","Real Madrid revealed £328m plans to revamp the stadium last January .

"Paul Scholes has slammed Louis van Gaal for reacting to Sam Allardyce's 'long-ball United' comments  - labelling the Dutchman's outburst 'bizarre'. The former England midfielder believes Van Gaal, as manager of Manchester United, should have ignored the West Ham manager's comments, which were made following the 1-1 draw at Upton Park on Sunday. The 63-year-old turned up for his press conference ahead of United's game against Burnley on Wednesday with a four-page dossier, which he insisted dispelled the claims made by Allardyce. Paul Scholes (left) says Louis van Gaal's reaction to Sam Allardyce's 'long-ball United' remark was 'bizarre' Scholes, speaking on the Fletch & Sav show, was unimpressed with the United manager's reaction . The United manager brandishes part of his dossier as he attempts to prove that United are not a long-ball side . Van Gaal looks unimpressed as he tells a packed press conference about his tactics . The statistics quoted in the A4 pamphlet, which were put together by Van Gaal's analysts, claim West Ham sent a higher percentage of their long passes forward than United during the match. The exact figures showed 71.1 per cent of West Ham's 'long passes' - of over 25 metres - went forward whereas United's percentage was just 49.9 per cent. However, Scholes, speaking on the Fletch & Sav show following Liverpool's win over Tottenham on Tuesday night, said there was no need for the United manager to react. He said: 'Why would you react to a West Ham manager, it’s different if it’s a rival manager like Chelsea or Manchester City's, but at the end of the day you're the Manchester United manager. 'I found it all bizarre to be honest with you, as I felt Allardyce's comments were light-hearted in the first place.' West Ham boss Allardyce labelled Louis van Gaal's side 'long-ball United' following Sunday's 1-1 draw . Van Gaal was clearly annoyed at Allardyce's comments and he had the pamphlet on his desk waiting when he fielded the first question about the West Ham manager's jibe . The former Barcelona boss insisted his team only started launching balls forward after 6ft 4in Marouane Fellaini came on in the 76th minute of the draw against West Ham . The 63-year-old hands the pages of his dossier to journalists during Tuesday's press conference . This sheet suggests United had a 56 per cent success rate of their 41 'long and forward' passes during the match at West Ham. The blue arrows indicate a successful pass . Scholes later went on to question Van Gaal's decision to deploy Rooney in midfield rather than as a striker this season, as well as expressing his disappointment at the level of United's performances. He added: ‘It’s not great to watch - put it that way. I've heard Van Gaal say recently that United can't take risks, but what message does that send to the fans? 'It’s all about taking risks as a Manchester United player and having the balls and tenacity to go out and attack the opposition. West Ham made just 11 of their 32 'long and forward' passes during the match, according to boss Van Gaal . Van Gaal claims United made 49.9 per cent of 'long passes forward' in comparison to West Ham's 71 per cent . Van Gaal freely admits that Man United played more long balls when Fellaini was introduced . When a colleague of mine is saying this kind of thing then, yeah, you have to see the data and you have to put the data in the right context I believe. I think the media is also coming to the match and you have a lot of opinion about me, or the game, or the players and now you say that you have no opinion. When you have 0 per cent ball possession do you think that you can do that with long balls? Yeah, long balls, in the width, to switch the play. You have to look at the data and then you will see that we did play long balls, but long balls wide, rather than to the striker.  A ball to the forward striker is mainly caused by long-ball play. Because I expected this question, I have made an interpretation of the data for this game and then I have to say that it is not a good interpretation from Big Sam. It is not so difficult also to read that. I am sorry, but we are playing ball possession play and after 70 minutes we did not succeed, in spite of many chances in the second half, then I changed my playing style. Then, of course, with the quality of Fellaini we played more forward balls and we scored from that, so I think it was a very good decision of the manager. But, when you see overall the long ball, and what is the percentage of that, then West Ham have played 71 per cent of the long balls to the forwards and we 49. So, I give you this and you can see that the blue ones are the good ones because long balls are also very difficult, which is why I began with the explanation of ball possession. When you have 60 per cent ball possession you cannot play long balls. So again, they did it 71 and we 49, and I give it you, you can copy it and then maybe you can go to Big Sam and he will get a good interpretation. 'They're (the fans) used to watching United teams that play high intensity football and score plenty of goals - and that just hasn't happened this season. ‘The two centre forwards - whoever has been playing up there in different games this season - have not been good enough either. ‘He (Rooney) scores goals, creates them and gives endless amounts of energy - this is Wayne Rooney - how many goals has he scored for Manchester United and England? 'He's wasted in midfield or on the wing, he's got to be playing upfront.'","Paul Scholes says Louis van Gaal's pre-match press conference on Tuesday was 'bizarre'

"Sky Sports have retained their stranglehold on the Premier League’s live TV rights as part of a staggering £5.136billion deal. The seven packages on offer for the three seasons, starting from 2016-17, went to Sky and BT Sport in what is a 70 per cent increase in value on the current three-year deal for the world’s richest league. Sky are buying 126 games per season — the maximum allowed — for £4.2bn, an 83 per cent rise on their present agreement. In contrast, BT Sport have paid £960m for 42 games per campaign — a 30 per cent increase in the cost of their current 38-game set of rights.

They take in Friday nights, Saturday lunchtimes, two slots on Sunday and Monday evening, plus Bank Holidays. Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said: ‘I am constantly surprised by the numbers of our TV deals. The little ol’ Premier League is doing quite well.’ A Sky spokesman said: ‘The company will work hard to minimise the impact of higher rights costs on our customers.’ Just nine months ago, Richard Scudamore’s position was threatened by the furore aroused by his sexist email exchange and the prospect of serious heart surgery.

And with each televised game bringing in £10m in rights, the Premier League’s first £500,000-a-week footballer can’t be far away. The haul for the seven packages of 168 live games per season was a 70 per cent increase on the current deal. That was way beyond the most optimistic expectation of any of the top flight clubs, especially as the highlights deal had gone for just a modest 13.5 per cent increase to BBC. Sportsmail had predicted a £5bn return but that was in the expectation that America’s Discovery Channel and Qatar’s BeIn Sport would be fully involved. The strict confidentiality covering the process means it is still not clear whether either network put an offer on the table, though probably neither did. Sky Sports pundits Souness (left) and Henry analyse a recent televised game . BT Sport presenter Jake Humphreys with pundits Michael Owen, Steve McManaman and David James . But in two rounds of bidding, Scudamore and his team of TV strategist David Kogan, lawyer Nick West and Premier League broadcasting chief Paul Molnar were still able to extract £5.136bn from Sky and BT Sport. The price was driven by Sky’s frantic desire to retain their rights at any cost while not losing out to their arch pay-TV rivals. Sky have paid £4.2bn over three years for 126 games a season spread over Friday nights, Saturday lunchtime, Sunday afternoons, Monday nights and bank holidays. They get 10 more games a season than under the current deal but will be paying 83 per cent more. The £2bn increase will inevitably lead to higher subscription costs. While Sky will pay £11.1m a game, BT are paying a more realistic £7.6m for each of their 42 live matches per season. Scudamore said: These are huge companies doing huge things and we are the beneficiaries. Seven packages were available in the auction, five with 28 games per season and two with 14 games per season. THE PACKAGES SKY WON . Package A comprises 28 games on Saturday lunchtimes (12.30pm). Package C has 28 games kicking off between 1.30pm and 2.15pm on Sundays. Pack A has 6 'first pick' games from 38 rounds and B has 9 first picks. Package D is the 4pm Sunday bundle of 28 games - crucially with 18 'first pick' games. Package E is the 'Monday night football' (8pm) bundle, with 18 games on Mondays plus 10 on Fridays; this is the first time Premier League games will be shown live on Friday evenings. There are no first picks in this package. Package G is a bundle of 14 games on Bank Holidays and other Sunday matches with two first picks. THE PACKAGES BT SPORT WON . Package B has 28 games at tea-time on Saturdays (5.30pm) Packages F has 14 games, a mix of midweek and Saturday games including three first picks. Under the current ongoing deals Sky have paid £2.28bn over three years from 2013-16 for 116 games per season, or in other words, get 348 games at £6,551,724 each. BT have paid £738m over three years from 2013-16 for 38 games per season, or in other words, get 114 games at £6,473,684 each. 50 per cent of the revenue is divided equally between the clubs . 25 per cent is awarded on a merit basis, determined by final league positions . 25 per cent is distributed as a facilities fee for televised matches . NICK HARRIS . ‘The Premier League is a success story. It is a great UK export. The Premier League, the BBC, the Queen — these are things that make people feel good about the UK.’ Sky chief executive Jeremy Darroch said: ‘This confirms that Sky is the unrivalled choice for sports fans. We went into the Premier League auction with a clear objective and are pleased to secure the rights that we wanted.’ BT say they are also happy with their increase in games — up from 38 to 42 — though they failed to break Sky’s stranglehold on the main packages and first picks. Virgin Media made a fanciful attempt to delay the auction until their complaint about the bidding process is fully investigated by Ofcom. Chief executive Tom Mockridge said: ‘The auction is a license to print money for the Premier League. There are better ways to structure the auction.’ There are 20 unbelievably rich Premier league clubs who will certainly disagree.","Sky Sports and BT Sport have paid £5.136bn to secure Premier League TV right from 2016-19 .

"A family in Chicago is claiming that a police officer unjustly shot their seven-month-old miniature bull terrier, Colonel, seriously injuring the dog that they had hoped to enter into competition. According to the dog's owner, Al Phillips, the officer shot the dog twice, after it followed him out of the house. 'My little bull terrier followed me out,' Phillips told Fox 32 in Chicago. 'Then, all I hear is boom! Boom! Two shots. You shot the dog.' The officer was giving Phillips a parking ticket in front of his home in the North Side of Chicago. Shocking: A Chicago family is claiming that a police officer shot their seven-month-old miniature bull terrier Colonel for no reason. Recovering: The dog had to undergo five hours of surgery to repair a lacerated muscle as well remove shrapnel from his stomach and a spent casing from his leg . According to witnesses, the incident began Saturday afternoon, when a member of the Chicago Police Department began writing a parking ticket for Phillips' van, which had been parked in front of his house. Upon seeing this, Phillips said that he walked out to meet the officer and was unwittingly followed by his dog. Witness Charlene Dezengo told Fox 32 that the officer warned Phillips about the dog being loose but said that he didn't sound like he was in any danger. Meanwhile neighbor Todd McClay told . DNAinfo in Chicago that the dog came out 'wagging his tail' and that the . officer 'did not give [Phillips] ample time to get the dog.' He said that the officer screamed once, 'waited a couple seconds,' screamed again, 'waited a couple seconds,' and then 'he was firing.' Dezengo said she saw a similar thing. 'All of sudden I heard him say, ‘get your dog,' and then the next . statement was ‘get your dog,' and then he just pulled out his gun and . shot twice,' Dezengo said. After the shooting, witnesses say the officer calmly put his gun back into his holster and finished writing the ticket. Phillips' wife, Barbara, told DNAInfo that the officer was 'deranged.' 'First of all, the dog is not even 30 pounds,' she said. 'He ran out . with his tail wagging. He's a puppy. He's little!' After the shooting, she and her daughter, Morgan, rushed the dog to the vet, where he underwent a five hour surgery to treat the shrapnel in his stomach, shell casing in his leg and a lacerated muscle. The family said that they planned to enter the dog in competition, but no longer think they will be able to do so. His father was a champion show dog. Traumatized: Phillips said the family had planned to enter the dog into competition but will not be able to do so anymore. The family is contemplating suing the police department. To make matters worse, three days after the incident, two officers came by Phillips' home and gave him an addition ticket for not keeping the dog on a leash. They also asked why Phillips had contacted the media about the shooting. 'They were giving us a ticket, three days after the fact,' says . Phillips. 'So I think they're probably trying to cover their rear ends.' Residents of the neighborhood were also outraged over the fact that the shooting took place near a preschool and that other individuals, including children, could have been injured by what they see as an unnecessary use of force. Phillips said that his family is considering a petition drive to get the officer involved in the shooting out of the department. 'I'm mad enough to file a suit,' Phillips said. 'I'm so angered that I . believe I might be forced to do that. I don't know what my options are. But the . first thing, this guy should not be on the street. And if he has to be on the . street, we don't want him in this neighborhood.' For their part, the police department said the shooting . is being investigated by an independent police review authority board, and that they are . taking the matter seriously.","Chicago police officer shot a seven-month-old miniature bull terrier named Colonel on Saturday .

Chris (McMillan - her hair stylist), and he said, ""That’s [stylist] . Lawren Howell from Vogue!"" And then he said, ""I just cut that!"" So . that’s it.' So far, no regrets for the Hollywood actress, who has been engaged to her Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux for over a year. 'I did it! I feel great.

Angel Montague-Sayers , UK Creative Ambassador for Cloud Nine, added: 'Jennifer Aniston's new blunt hair cut is a dramatic change from her well known softer, layered 'Rachel' look. I think Jennifer suits softer more textured hairstyles which soften her features and work well with her face shape.

"Police in Rotherham faced fresh outrage last night after it emerged officers undermined investigations into rape and sexual assault against vulnerable girls. A damning report revealed a unit which deals with serious sex crimes spent a great deal of time trying to 'disprove the word' of some of the victims. Officers in South Yorkshire Police's child abuse unit were also 'pressured' by senior colleagues not to record rapes as crimes, it was revealed. Chief inspector of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary savaged the 'unacceptable' culture within South Yorkshire Police's public protection unit . In a scathing attack on practices within the force at the height of the scandal, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) savaged the 'unacceptable' culture within its public protection unit. Tom Winsor, the official police watchdog's chief inspector, said: 'This culture of dealing with reports of crime shows a disregard for victims and is unacceptable.' It also emerged last night that only three part-time police officers were responsible for catching rapists who abused hundreds of vulnerable children at the height of the Rotherham exploitation scandal. A confidential report by South Yorkshire Police reveals that up to 300 children were being sexually exploited in the county in 2010, with the total number of offences 'in the thousands.' But during that period there were 'only three officers across the whole force with a permanent responsibility for CSE [child sexual exploitation]'. One of these officers worked part time and the other two had 'additional portfolios that take up at least half their time'. At least 1,400 vulnerable children were horrifically abused by rapists – mainly of Asian origin – who escaped justice for 16 years in Rotherham . The report added: 'Force provision for the policing of child sexual exploitation is not equivalent to the scale and seriousness of the problem.' It echoes this week's damning dossier into the Rotherham scandal by Professor Alexis Jay, in which she described how 'senior and middle managers were more focused on dealing with offences such as burglary and vehicle crime'. The revelations heap new shame on South Yorkshire Police just days after the catastrophic scale of child sex abuse in Rotherham was exposed. At least 1,400 vulnerable children were horrifically abused by rapists – mainly of Asian origin – who escaped justice for 16 years. Police, council chiefs and social services repeatedly turned a blind eye to evidence that the defenceless girls had fallen into the clutches of a group of paedophiles between 1997 and last year. The officer who was head of South Yorkshire Police between 2004 and 2011 was best known for leading an ultimately embarrassing crusade against speeding motorists. Chief constable Meredydd Hughes CBE showed little sympathy for those clocked by speed cameras. He also demanded tougher sentences for hit-and-run motorists and those causing death by dangerous driving. This was going on a time when scores of young girls were being subjected to sexual exploitation including gang rapes, grooming and trafficking. His campaign reached a humiliating conclusion when he was caught driving at 90mph in a 60mph zone in 2007. Mr Hughes was disqualified from driving for 42 days and fined £350, and was left with little option but to step down from his role as chairman of roads policing at the Association of Chief Police Officers, which he had held for two years. He retired from South Yorkshire Police in 2011, before making a failed bid to be elected as the area’s first police and crime commissioner. He has however been awarded a CBE for his services to policing. But now campaigners and politicians will want to know whether the focus on speeding motorists was to the detriment of child sex abuse victims in the area his force covered. Mr Hughes could not be reached for comment last night. HMIC yesterday published a report criticising South Yorkshire Police for under-recording crime following a 12-month probe from November 2012. Inspectors highlighted the impact this practice had on vulnerable children who had been victims of sexual assault. Out of 152 incident records, inspectors found that 117 crimes should have been recorded – but 24 per cent of them were not. South Yorkshire Police was found to have a culture of 'investigate-to-record', where officers do not record incidents as possible crimes until they have been investigated – in contravention of Home Office rules. HMIC examined 66 violent offences, including rape, that South Yorkshire Police had written off as 'no-crime' but found 11 of these – just under 20 per cent – were wrongly classified and should have been pursued. The report said: 'This level of under-recorded crime is a significant cause of concern and is a matter of material and urgent importance, particularly as some of these relate to violence and sexual assault against vulnerable children.' Failure to record crimes properly was 'particularly evident in the public protection unit, with a great deal of time spent trying to disprove the word of the victim from the outset'. It said: 'We found that where a victim is vulnerable, either through age or mental health issues, and it appears that there is any doubt regarding the authenticity of the report, a no-crime [report] is often submitted.' Separately, the revelations over the tiny number of officers devoted to grooming came in a confidential 2010 report commissioned by Detective Superintendent Adrian Teague, the South Yorkshire force's director of intelligence and public protection. By 2013, the child sexual exploitation team at the force had increased to 11 police officers. But in that year they still had to deal with 294 complex abuse cases. Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP responsible for exposing the paedophile past of Liberal politician Cyril Smith, said: 'Vulnerable children are being fobbed off and not treated seriously.' Last night it also emerged around a quarter of violent and sexual offences were wrongly written off by the three biggest police forces in England and Wales. HMIC found 23 per cent of rape, robbery and violence allegations were incorrectly shelved by the Metropolitan Police, 24 per cent by West Midlands Police and almost 29 per cent by Greater Manchester Police. The Independent Police Complaints Commission warned it may investigate South Yorkshire Police over its failure to properly investigate allegations of major crimes. But a spokesman for the force defended its record, saying: 'The public protection unit is victim-led and officers take great care to ensure all victims of this type of crime are fully supported throughout an investigation, from the moment a report is received.'","South Yorkshire Police's child abuse unit  'pressured' not to record rapes .

The brother of  Meriam Ibrahim has said she 'should be executed' if she continues to be a Christian. Ms Ibrahim, who gave birth to a daughter in her prison cell last week, has been sentenced to  100 lashes and death by hanging because she had wed a non-Muslim . Ibrahim has a son, 18-month-old Martin, who is living with her in jail, where she gave birth to a second child last week. By law, children must follow their father's religion . But Ms Ibrahim, 27, maintains that her Muslim father . left when she was young and that she was raised a Christian by her . Ethiopian mother, who is an Orthodox Christian. 'It's one of two; if she repents and returns to our Islamic faith and to the embrace of our family, then we are her family and she is ours,' he said. 'But if she refuses she should be executed,' he told CNN. Today Ms Ibrahim's lawyer said she has appealed the sentence. The appeal demands the release of Ms Ibrahim, saying the court that tried her committed 'procedural errors,'  said her lawyer, Eman Abdul-Rahim. Ms Ibrahim ,a qualified doctor, was thrown in jail in September and earlier this month was sentenced to death for apostasy and adultery for marrying Daniel Wani in 2011, a Christian Sudanese man with U.S. citizenship who lives in Manchester, New Hampshire. As in many Muslim nations, Muslim women in Sudan are prohibited from marrying non-Muslims, though Muslim men can marry outside their faith. Ibrahim has a son, 18-month-old Martin, who is living with her in jail, where she gave birth to a second child last week. By law, children must follow their father's religion. A video shows Ibrahim with her newborn and her son Martin at the prison's hospital where she gave birth. Looking happy and relaxed, the video shows Ibrahim breastfeeding the baby while seated on a bed with Martin sitting close by. Amnesty International condemned the sentence against Ibrahim, calling it 'abhorrent,' and the U.S. State Department said it was 'deeply disturbed' by the sentence. Sudan introduced Islamic Shariah law in the early 1980s under the rule of autocrat Jaafar Nimeiri, a move that contributed to the resumption of an insurgency in the mostly animist and Christian south of Sudan. Meriam was condemned to death under Islamic law because she is Christian and married a Christian man . The south seceded in 2011 to become the world's newest nation, South Sudan. Sudanese President Omar Bashir, an Islamist who seized power in a 1989 military coup, has said his country will implement Islam more strictly now that the non-Muslim south is gone. A number of Sudanese have been convicted of apostasy in recent years, but they all escaped execution by recanting their new faith. Religious thinker and politician Mahmoud Mohammed Taha, a critic of Nimeiri and his interpretation of Shariah, was sentenced to death for apostasy. He was executed in 1985 at the age of 76. Campaigners . had said that they feared the Sudanese government was just ‘playing . games’ to try and get the international community off its back.","Al Samani Al Hadi said he denounced his sister Meriam Ibrahim, 27 .

"Africa's longest serving leader is building a new multi-billion pound capital city from scratch in the depths of the jungle - despite his people living on just £1.50 a day. Equatorial Guinea president Teodoro Obiang wants his government to move to the new multi-billion capital called Oyala by 2020.

"Abbey Crouch has been announced as the model who will close the Fashion for The Brave Gala catwalk this year, in an original design by fashion icon Julien McDonald. The British fashion star will follow in the footsteps of designers such as Vivienne Westwood and Jasper Conran who have produced amazing dresses for the gala in previous years. Abbey, who has been wowing the judges on BBC’s Strictly Come Dancing, will close the show in McDonald’s daring sequined design. The design will feature tiny Union Jacks, which will create a sparkling iridescent pattern with risque nude sheer panelling at the sides . Julian (left) and Abbey (pictured right with partner Aljaz Skorjanec), were competitors on Strictly Come Dancing until Julian was voted off the show two weeks ago . The model is no stranger to Julien's daring designs - she was photographed at the Attitude awards last month in a very sexy black dress with sheer panels. Every year a celebrated designer creates a spectacular one-of-a-kind patriotic dress for a model personality to showcase at the Fashion for The Brave Gala. It seems Julien, who was also a contestant on this year’s Strictly, seems to have taken inspiration from the show's infamous dazzling costumes. The bubbly Welshman found himself the third celebrity to be voted off the hit show two weeks ago, but obviously bears no grudge against his former competitor Abbey. The gown Abbey will wear is a red, blue and white floor length bodycon dress. Tiny Union Jacks create a sparkling iridescent pattern with nude sheer panelling at the sides to create a risque barely-there feel. The glitzy dress will no doubt impress the crowds at the gala, which is expected to be attended by its royal patron, HRH Princess Beatrice. The gala and the fashion show, which has being organised by Hilary Alexander OBE and Lesley Goring, will be held at the Dorchester Hotel on November 8. Abbey Crouch (left) will model the design by Julien McDonald (pictured right with Melissa Odabash) at the gala at the Dorchester Hotel which will raise money for military charities . In 2010 violinist Linzi Stoppard modelled a Jasper Conran Union Jack gown . An auction will also be held at the glamorous event to raise money for the charities. This year Fashion for The Brave Gala is supporting the Household Cavalry Foundation and Soldiering On. The Household Cavalry is made up of Britain’s two most senior Regiments, The Life Guards and The Blues and Royals. The Household Cavalry Foundation cares for the casualties, serving soldiers, veterans, horses and heritage of the Household Cavalry. The Soldiering On Through Life Trust recognise outstanding achievements of teams or individuals from within the Armed Forces and raise sustainable funds for the military charities which support injured Service personnel and their families throughout life.","Fashion for the Brave Gala held to raise funds for military charities .

"Salvador Orozco, 48, has been detained in Hawaii in connection with a rape in Gateshead 23 years ago . A man wanted in connection with the brutal rape of a barmaid in Gateshead more than two decades ago has been arrested in Hawaii, it has been revealed. U.S. police arrested Salvador Orozco, 48, after executing a warrant at an address in the popular tourist destination. Cold-case detectives are now waiting for American officials to extradite Orozco to the UK where he will be questioned by officers. Orozco is wanted in connection with an attack that happened on May 17, 1990, which saw a 20-year-old barmaid ambushed. She was savagely attacked as she made her way home from work on Askew Road in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear. She was dragged into a deserted yard and subjected to a horrific assault in which the attacker told her: 'My name is Sushi. I'm Japanese.' A Home Office spokesman today confirmed they were waiting for officials in the US to send the suspect back to England for questioning. He said: 'We can confirm Salvador Orozco was arrested on February 7 in Hawaii on a UK extradition warrant. 'He is wanted for alleged sexual offences dating back to 1990. The extradition process is now a matter for the US authorities.' Orozco is alleged to have eluded authorities for more than two decades after fleeing the UK and heading for America and then Hawaii. In July last year British Embassy officials contacted the US Justice Department in an effort to locate, arrest and extradite him to the UK. American police today said he was wanted in Newcastle for one count of rape, one count of indecent assault and one other sexual offence. And a Northumbria Police spokesman said there is an 'ongoing investigation' into the incident. He said: 'We can confirm that an investigation is ongoing into the rape of a woman in Gateshead on May 17, 1990. 'We've been made aware that an arrest has been made in connection with the inquiry.' Orozco was arrested 'without incident' at around 9pm last Thursday (FEB 7) at a property on Puunene Avenue, in the isolated Kahului area of Hawaii. It came after law-enforcement agencies followed his tracks from America to the tropical island. [caption .

"Little Amber Travers was two years old when she almost died from meningitis. She had been intensive care for three days when doctors made the heartbreaking decision to amputate her limbs in the hope of saving her life. Three years later - now five - she is the youngest to appear in a series of compelling photographs to raise awareness about the illness. Five-year-old Amber Travers (right) and her sister Jade, eight, feature in the awareness campaign for Meningitis Now and the Meningitis Research Foundation. Amber caught the disease when she was just two . In fact Amber, pictured with her sister Jade, eight, from Liverpool, has just learned to walk using prosthetic limbs which were fitted last Autumn. The pictures have been taken by Australian photographer Anne Geddes as part of a campaign being jointly run by charities including Meningitis Now and the Meningitides Research Foundation. Around 3,400 Britons are infected with bacterial meningitis - the most serious form - each year, many of them children and teenagers. About 1 in 10 die and up to a quarter are left with life-long complications including amputated limbs, deafness or learning disabilities. Ellie-May Challis (left) contracted the illness when she was just 16-months old. For the campaign she was pictured with her sister Sophie by Anne Geddes, a photographer famous for her images of babies in flower pots . It is caused by an infection of the meninges cells in the brain and spinal cord which can lead to blood poisioning. Symptoms include a severe headache, fever, vomiting, blotchy skin and usually cold hands or feet. Viral meningitis - the other type - is far more common but less serious. Other children appearing in the photographs are Harvey Parry, eight, who contracted the condition when he was one, and Ellie-May Challis, who was infected at just 16 months. Anne Geddes, whose pictures will be published online on 24 April, which is World Meningitis Awareness Day said: ‘As a mother and passionate advocate of children, I want to empower parents to understand meningitis and know how best to protect their children. ‘You only need to look at Amber, Ellie and Harvey to understand the impact of this devastating disease. It really would be your worst nightmare to see any child go through such an ordeal. Harvey Parry, eight, lost his legs and part of his right hand aged one because of meningitis . ‘But at the same time, these children and their families are overcoming huge obstacles to rebuild their lives and these beautiful pictures capture their strength in the face of adversity.’ In an interview in 2011, Amber’s mother Vicky, now 27, said: ‘I never want Amber to feel different or to feel she can’t do what she likes, achieve what she wants, because of what’s happened. ‘We could have so easily lost her. The surgery she had saved her life and yes, she’s physically different now. ‘But she still has the same personality, she’s still Amber. She’s still my little girl. ‘And if telling her story can help one other child then that has to be to the good.’","Meningitis charities launch awareness campaign using images .

"The victim allegedly molested by Stephen Collins was shocked into sharing her story after reading his sordid novels, it has emerged. The woman - who has not been named - claims that the actor molested her between the aged of 11 and 13, but says she kept quiet about it for years. However, the experience of reading two highly sexualized novels by Collins in 2000 inspired the woman to write an anonymous message to his wife Faye Grant. Scroll down for video . Revelations: Stephen Collins, pictured above with wife Faye Grant, allegedly abused the victim in the 1970s, who spoke out after reading his sexualized novels . The message described the alleged molestation, and warned that he was capable of doing it to more people, according to TMZ. According to the reports, it was not until 2012 that the woman reported the alleged incidents to police. The novels in question are Eye Contact, published in 1994, and Double Exposure, from 1998. Collins's website - which has now been replaced with a holding page - was until this week advertising both novels on his website, but has posted warnings describing them as 'not appropriate' for his younger fans. Eye Contact, which a former neighbor of Collins called 'semi-pornographic', is the story of a sex-crazed actress who seduces men she meets in public places. One conquest  - however - proves more than she can handle, and the woman ends up standing accused of murder. Collins has written two sexualized mystery-thriller novels, Eye Contact (left) and Double Exposure (right) Meanwhile, Double Exposure charts the chaotic life of a television insider overwhelmed by lust for an attractive new neighbor he spies through his window. The relationship descends into kidnappings and violence, ending it what reviews call a 'forcibly twisted climax'. New York City police announced this week that they have an open investigation into allegations Stephen Collins molested a teenage girl in the early 1970s. The complaint was filed in 2012 accusing Collins of forcing a 14-year-old girl to commit a lewd act in the actor's Manhattan apartment in 1972. An NYPD spokesman said the case remains open and is being handled by Special Victims Division detectives, but no charges have been filed. Bombshell claims: Collins, 67, was accused of molesting the teenage girls, and the NYPD is investigating . Faye Grant wrote in a sworn court declaration in Los Angeles last year that her husband had disclosed he molested at least three young girls, including a relative. Grant wrote in the November 2012 declaration in the couple's divorce case that she reported abuse to Los Angeles police, who said they are not actively investigating the actor, but could not offer details on any previous investigations . ‘Stephen admitted that he has engaged in a long-term pattern of sexually abusing minor children, including sexually molesting three young girls over a decade ago,’ Grant wrote in the sworn declaration, which was filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court in November. The report to New York police was made six months after Collins filed to divorce Grant, whom he married in 1985. Grant and Collins separated in February 2012, about two weeks after the actress said she learned of her husband's alleged pedophilia in therapy sessions, according to her declaration. Collins filed for divorce three months after the separation. In the divorce filings obtained by MailOnline, Grant claims her husband used his fame to trick abused children. 'I believe that Stephen used his celebrity status to engender the trust of the families of the children he molested,' Grant wrote. 'I further believe that there have been other victims, but he has thus far only confessed to those three girls. 'I am particularly afraid of what may happen if he does not seek treatment, because he may be working or interacting with children in connection with his employment.'","Victim said that she was shocked into speaking by Stephen Collins novels .

"A third of all women murdered in the U.S. are killed by male partners, a study has revealed. The further south couples live the more likely women are to be victims of domestic violence. The Violence Policy Center records which states have the highest number of cases in which one man kills one woman and found that in 2012 Alaska had the highest rate of domestic homicide. Southern domestic homicide: A third of women murdered in the United States are done so by their significant other, most of whom live in the south and are allowed to carry a gun . A recorded total of 2.57 women were killed in Alaska for every 100,000. Over half of all women who were killed by intimate males between 2001 to 20012 in the United States were killed using a gun, not surprisingly in states with lenient gun policies. Between 2003 and 2012 Nevada had the highest domestic homicide rate of 2.447 women killed per every 100,000. Nevada's rate recently dropped to 1.83. The Huffington Post reports that the numbers of women abused by their partners compared to the number of men is vastly unequal which stifles the myth that men and women abuse alike. Still problem: Since the Violence Against Women Act was passed in 1994, domestic violence rates have fallen 64 per cent but an average of three women is still killed every day . In 2010, 85 per cent of domestic abuse victims were women and 15 per cent were men. Between 2003 and 2012 34 per cent of domestic homicides had female victims compared to only 2.5 per cent males. Over 18,000 women have been killed by male intimate partners since 2003. Southern states including Alaska have a tendency to have more lenient gun control laws, something that may indicate the higher numbers of domestic homicide in the Southern states. According to the website NRA-ILA, a permit to carry a concealed gun is not required in Alaska. Nor is a permit required to purchase a handgun in the state of Alaska. Since the Violence Against Women Act was passed in 1994, domestic violence rates have fallen 64 per cent but an average of three women is still killed every day.","At least one third of all victims of homicide are women killed by male significant others .

"Police and family members are desperately searching for a 33-year-old woman recently returned from a two-year, around-the-world trip who disappeared during a visit to relatives in Texas. Leanne Hecht Bearden and her husband Joshua Bearden, 39, traveled the world for 22 months without a mishap but after returning to the U.S. Leanne Bearden has gone missing. The couple was staying with Joshua Bearden's parents near San Antonio last week after returning from their trip abroad when she went out for a walk and never returned. Missing: Leanne Hecht Bearden went for a walk in Texas and never returned . Travels: The couple had just returned to the U.S. after their journey around the world . Bearden, a marketing graduate, left the house in Garden Ridge on January 17 wearing jeans and hiking boots and carrying about $60 in cash and some credit cards. 'We're very concerned,' Bearden's brother Michael Hecht told WSBTV. 'She left of her own free will to go for a walk and that's all we know. We're wondering what's happened. Maybe she went for a hike, saw a nice place somewhere she could hike and maybe is hurt, or has fallen over. We don't know.' The couple had intended to stay briefly in Texas before flying to their home in Denver to begin searching for work. According to CNN, the couple has been married for four years. Grief: Leanne's family are devastated by their loss and thanked the many people involved in trying to find the 33-year-old . 'Her husband is devastated right now and is extremely worried. We're just trying to help out the Police Department as much as we can canvassing the area, even going father out than we think she may be. But we have absolutely no idea where she is,' Hecht told WBSTV. According to My San Antonio, Bearden was planning to return to the home within an hour in order to take a phone call about a job in Denver. She was reported missing by her husband after she had been gone about four hours. At about that time, Bearden's parents returned home from an out-of-town trip. Search: Facebook pages and leaflets were set up to try to find Leanne . 'We could draw up scenarios that range from the sublime to the ridiculous,' Will Bearden told My San Antonio. 'I just stick with what we know. What we know is she was seen leaving our house Friday, and no one has seen her since.' Right now police say there is 'no indication at this time that this is criminal in nature.' Family friend Chris Busch told the Huffington Post that all leads are being followed. 'The area out there is surrounded by very rocky and rugged terrain,' Busch told The Huffington Post. 'There are caves, cliffs and all sorts of other things.' 'The options go from a twisted ankle to a snake bite,' he said. 'Is . it possible she was abducted? Yeah. There were two attacks on women . recently in the area. The police are looking into those. From our . standpoint, we are just out there trying to cover as much ground as . possible.' New life: Leanne and her husband were planning to return to their home in Denver and find work after their trip . The family organized 50 volunteers to search for Leanne Bearden on Wednesday and hired two helicopters, with the help of donations, to scour the area. 'Although we did not find her, we did cover a rather large area where we now know she is not,' her family said on a Facebook page started in her name. Garden Ridge police are planning a formal search on Saturday. 'Officials are asking that private volunteers and volunteer organizations refrain from searching this immediate area so not to interfere with the search or contaminate the area,' police said Thursday, reports CNN. 'Garden Ridge Police Department, Comal County Sheriff's Office, Comal County Constables, Schertz Police Department, Texas Rangers and Bracken First Responders will be supporting with the rescue.'","Leanne Bearden, 33, left her in-laws' Texas home on January 17 for a walk, planning to return in an hour .

"A group of teachers in Sarasota, Florida, put their markers and lesson plans aside on Friday to learn how to take down an armed gunman in hopes of preventing another tragic school shooting. Under the tutelage of weapons instructor Michael Magowan, local public school teachers practiced drills on disarming an attacker holding a rubber gun to their head during a free class at the Veritas Training Academy. During the class, teachers set behind desks, clutching fake handguns and intently watched Magowan as he demonstrated how to properly handle a firearm. Jarring scene: A teacher in Sarasota, Florida, is learning how to disarm a gunman holding a plastic weapon to her head during a free training session . Risky business: Firearms instructor Mike Magowan (center) uses a rubber training pistol to demonstrate how to disarm a person holding a gun to one's head as he speaks to students . Drastic response: The December 14 tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut, where 20 first-graders and six adults were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School, has sparked a national debate about whether to arm teachers . Switching from theory to practice, the educators later took part in shooting exercises at a firing range on the premises of the learning center, firing at a target depicting a burly, moustachioed assailant holding a little boy hostage. This is only the latest example of what has become a national trend of educators flocking to gun ranges and weapons training classes to learn how to defend their students in the aftermath of the Newtown, Connecticut, school massacre that has left 20 elementary school children and six adults dead. In Texas, two concealed handgun classes graduated 460 teachers, while 1,100 signed up for a three-day gun course in Ohio. In Utah last month, 200 teachers volunteered for six hours of firearms training. Aim, fire! Targets depicting an armed adult taking a child hostage are set out on the firing line . Controversial stance: Magowan (center) wields a rubber training pistol to demonstrate a shooting stance to his students at the Veritas Training Academy . Kudos: The firearms instructor, right, congratulates a woman named Christie, a teacher at a nearby high school, for her performance in shooting the depicted assailant . Uptick: There has been an influx of teachers flocking to gun ranges and applying for conceal gun permits nationwide . Gun ranges throughout the country have been reporting an increase in teachers coming in for weapons training, but not everyone is on board with this response to the Sandy hook tragedy, which is especially controversial in states like Florida where law prohibits teachers from carrying guns in school grounds, according to The Palm Beach Post. Amid a contentious national debate about gun control and gun violence, images of educators learning to disarm gunmen and firing weapons have been met with both shock and words of praise. Those who support the idea of weapons training for teachers believe that if another gunman . targets a school he will face an armed response rather than classrooms . full of defenseless staff and children. ‘I actually like the idea. I think it's better to be safe and cautious,' Chicago parent Jennifer Thompson told NECN. Be prepared: Joanna Baginska, a fourth grade teacher at Odyssey Charter School in American Fork, Utah is shown how to handle a 40 cal. Sig Sauer by firearm instructor Clark Aposhian . However,  Mandy Koehl disagreed, saying, ‘I think putting guns that close to . children presents a risk in itself, so I'm not sure it sends the right . message,’ During the training session in Utah last month, primary school teacher Jessica Fiveash said: ‘If we have the ability to stop something, we should do it.’ The basic training by the Utah Shooting Sports Council emphasized how teachers should show their gun, as well as taking cover, before trying to shoot. The teachers applied for a concealed weapons permit, submitting fingerprints and a mugshot for a criminal background check. Cori Sorensen, a fourth grade teacher from Highland Elementary School in Highland, Utah, receives firearms training with a .357 magnum from personal defense instructor Jim McCarthy during concealed weapons training for 200 Utah teachers . Clark Aposhian, President of Utah Shooting Sport Council, holds a pistol during the concealed weapons training. The lobby group offered six hours free training . In Ohio, a firearms group said it was . launching a scheme in firearms training for 24 teachers and Arizona is . proposing a change to the law to allow a teacher in each school to carry . a gun. Some parents have questioned the cost of arming and training . school staff and also whether it will keep anyone safe. Opponents . list potential dangers such as teachers being overpowered for their . weapons or students getting them and shooting classmates, either . accidentally or on purpose. The moves to train teachers come after the National Rifle Association proposed placing an armed officer at each of the nation's schools, though some schools already have police officers. Parents and educators have questioned how safe the proposal would keep children and whether it would be economically feasible. Around 200 teachers watched intently and made notes as Mr Aposhian demonstrated with a plastic gun during concealed-weapons training offered free in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre . Adam Lanza killed his mother and then went on a rampage through the Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, killing 20 children and six adults before turning the gun on himself . Following the Connecticut tragedy, NRA's chief executive Wayne LaPierre famously claimed: 'The only . way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun.' Larry . Pratt, executive director advocacy group Gun Owners of America, also . claimed that gun control supporters ‘have the blood of little children . on their hands’ and the tragedy could have been prevented if the . teachers were allowed to carry weapons. Some educators say it is dangerous to allow guns on campus. Among the potential dangers they point to are teachers being overpowered for their weapons or students getting them and accidentally or purposely shooting classmates. 'It's a terrible idea,' said Carol Lear, a chief lawyer for the Utah Office of Education. 'It's a horrible, terrible, no-good, rotten idea.' Mr Aposhian demonstrates with a plastic gun, rear, while Joanna Baginska, a 4th grade teacher from Odyssey Charted School, in American Fork, practices with a 40 cal. Sig Sauerr . Christine Caldwell, left, receives firearms training with a 9mm Glock from Mr McCarthy. It is the latest effort to arm teachers to confront school assailants . Kristen Rand, the legislative . director for the Violence Policy Center, a gun control advocacy . organisation, said to believe that a 'teacher would be successful in . stopping someone who has made the decision to engage in a shootout is . just not rationale'. 'No teacher is ever going to be as effective as a trained law enforcement officer,' Ms Rand said. Even trained police officers don't always hit their targets, and arming teachers could put innocent students at risk of crossfire, she said. Gun-rights advocates say teachers can act more quickly than law enforcement in the critical first few minutes to protect children from the kind of deadly shooting that took place in Connecticut. They emphasized the importance of reacting appropriately under pressure. Mr Aposhian says that a gun gives teachers another option if a shooter breaks into a classroom . The teachers listened intently to the lessons. Some claimed they do not see anything wrong with arming educators . 'We're not suggesting that teachers . roam the halls looking for an armed intruder', said Clark Aposhian, . chairman of the Utah Shooting Sports Council, the state's biggest gun . lobby. 'They should lock down the classroom. But a gun is one more option if the shooter breaks into a classroom.' They cautioned teachers about the liability that comes with packing a gun in public. 'I wouldn't hesitate to shoot if the . danger was immediate,' said Ms Fiveash, adding that her laser sight . would make shooting in tight quarters safer. English . teacher Kevin Leatherbarrow said he often felt threatened while working . at an inner-city school in Buffalo, New York, where he got a license to . carry a pistol. He moved less than a year ago to Utah, where he feels safer. But he said gun violence can break out anywhere. Mr . Leatherbarrow said he was highly trained in handling guns - and was . taking criticism from parents who don't appreciate his views on school . safety. Mr Aposhian, who demonstrated personally using plastic weapons during the six hour session, said that having a gun was a 'responsibility' Stephen Pratt, a third grade teacher from Alpine, Utah, is fingerprinted for a gun carry permit by instructor Mr McCarthy, right . 'I'm in agreement not everybody should be carrying firearms in school. They're not trained. But for some parents to think we're cowboys, that frustrates me,' he said.'I wish parents would understand.' In the U.S. the number of homicides at schools of children, ages 5-18, have been lower year-by-year in the 2000s than they were in the mid- to late-1990s, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics report on school crime released in 2012. At 32 deaths, the 2006-2007 school . year was the only one that reached the levels from the 1990s. The manner . of death was not listed. Utah . is among a few states that let people carry licensed concealed weapons . into public schools without exception, the National Conference of State . Legislatures says in a 2012 compendium of state gun laws. Utah . educators say they would ban guns if they could, but legislators left . them with no choice. State law forbids schools, districts or college . campuses from imposing their own gun restrictions.","Free training session was offered by Veritas Training Academy to teachers in Sarasota, Florida .

"The German Medical Association has apologised for the sadistic experiments carried out by Nazi doctors on Jews. The body has admitted that many doctors under Nazi-rule during the Second World War were guilty of 'scores of human rights violations'. German doctors performed pseudo-scientific experiments on concentration camp inmates, including at Auschwitz. Auschwitz prisoners: The German Medical Association has admitted that many doctors under Nazi-rule during the Second World War were guilty of 'scores of human rights violations' They were also  key to the Nazi's program of forced sterilisation or euthanasia of the mentally ill or others deemed 'unworthy of life'. In a statement made in Nuremberg this week, the German medical association said  'these crimes were not the actions of individual doctors but involved leading members of the medical community'. The crimes should be taken as a warning for the future, it added. The doctors were 'guilty, contrary to their mission to heal, of scores of human rights violations and we ask the forgiveness of their victims, living and deceased, and of their descendants'. Perhaps the most notorious Nazi doctor was Auschwitz medic Josef Mengele. Known as the 'Angel of Death', he consigned arrivals to the gas chambers and carried out appalling medical experiments on Jews, most of whom died in agony without anaesthetic. He escaped to Brazil at the end of the war and for decades was the most wanted Nazi war criminal.  He died in 1979 after suffering a stroke while swimming. Another infamous Nazi doctor was Dr Aribert Heim, the so-called ‘Doctor Death’, who would inject substances such as petrol, water or poison directly into his victims’ hearts. He would often perform operations without anaesthesia to see how much pain humans could endure. Notorious: Nazi doctors Josef Mengele (left), known as the 'Angel of Death', and Aribert Heim (right), the so-called 'Doctor Death' And in one notorious ‘experiment’ he castrated and decapitated a young athlete, before having the flesh boiled off his skull, to be used as a display piece. Until 2008, Heim’s actions earned him a place as the most-wanted Nazi war criminal still thought to be at large. But the 2009 discovery of a battered and rusting briefcase held in storage by the Cairo hotel owner now indicates that the hunt may finally be over. It contained medical records showing that Heim suffered from rectal cancer, which eventually killed him in 1992. He is then thought to have been buried in an anonymous grave, although there are some who think the evidence is far from conclusive and that he may still be alive. Guy Walters, author of Nazi war criminal book Hunting Evil, said: 'Heim is one of the major criminals of the last century. 'His experiments that he carried out on concentration camp victims were disgusting and he was currently being hunted for his crimes.' Although Heim was captured in a general round-up of leading Nazis by U.S. forces in March 1945, he was released because his name did not appear on any of the lists of war criminals the Allies had quickly drawn up. He became a gynaecologist in West Germany until 1962, when his past caught up with him in the form of the Austrian police, who were finally investigating him for his war crimes. Heim was tipped off and he escaped, reportedly to Spain and then to Uruguay, where he opened up a gynaecological practice. Since the 1960s, Heim had been able to live a relatively unmolested life, and quietly amassed a small fortune.",Body admits many doctors under Nazi-rule during WWII were guilty of 'scores of human rights violations'
"You couldn't really blame him for taking a curtain call. The Duchess of Cambridge might have been queen of Centre Court but yesterday – for the moment at least – Andy Murray was king.

Murray said: 'If I'd known they were . coming, I would have shaved. I was thinking to myself as I came off I . was sweaty and very hairy. I said to them, ""I'm sorry, I'm a bit . sweaty"". But it was very nice to get to meet them.' The bow, he said, was 'just, yeah, . sort of off the cuff. Didn't think too much about it'. He added: 'I was . obviously very happy after the match.

"The recent heatwave is thought to have brought killer blue sharks closer to the coast of Cornwall than ever before. Diver Nick Robertson-Brown was photographing sea life with his wife Caroline when they spotted several of the sharks. The specie is normally confined to the mid-Atlantic but last month it was spotted as close as 10 miles off the coast of Penzance. Predators: Nick Robertson-Brown was photographing sea life with his wife when they spotted several of the sharks . Just last week Mr Robertson-Brown was diving only five miles from the coast when he came across a hungry pack. He says he has also spotted them as close as three miles from shore before. He said: ‘The warmer weather has brought these sharks closer and closer to the coastline. 'They have been spotted only three miles from the coast - which is a lot further in than where they are usually found. The animal is normally confined to the mid-Atlantic but have been popping up along the Cornwall coastline . Last week Mr Robertson-Brown was diving only five miles from the coast when he came across this shark . Close encounter: Diver Nick Robertson-Brown has said he has seen them as close as three miles from shore . ‘The blue sharks are a very inquisitive shark. They came right up to us, which can be quite scary if you have never encountered a shark before. ‘To have one press its nose right up against your diving mask is quite a nerve-wracking experience. Blue sharks are considered to be dangerous and have been known to be responsible for attacks on ship and air disaster victims. In the past five years four people have been killed by a blue shark. The largest ever recorded was 12ft 6in, but females average 9ft and males 8ft. The specie has a bright blue body with a white underside and a pointed snout with long pectoral fins (on the side of the body). They are also recognisable with their triangular, serrated teeth and large eyes. Blue sharks normally inhabit deep water in tropical, subtropical, and temperate seas worldwide. They are voracious predators, feeding on schools of fish including anchovies, sardines, herring and squid. They can also travel hundreds of miles each year gathering in large groups or packs. Females give birth to 25-50 pups, (although once, a litter of 135 individuals was recorded) after a gestation period lasting 9-12 months. They are classified as Lower Risk by the 2000 The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. ‘We were only five miles away from the coast. 'The warmer weather may well have brought the mackerel closer in, which is what they feed off. ‘We weren’t expecting to see them as close to the coast as this, so it was a real shock.’ The creatures - one of the ocean’s quickest predators  - mostly eat squid and mackerel but have killed four people worldwide in the past five years. They can grow up to 12ft long and are known as the ‘wolves of the sea’ because they gather in packs. They are related to several other species, including tiger and bull sharks. Mr Robertson-Brown, 60, said: ‘We were surprised to see them so close in to the coastline, but the warmer weather is causing a lot of change in the seas. ‘The following day a diving colleague of ours saw some of the sharks in at three miles, and they were in a very large group of nine. ‘We made sure we wore black diving gloves, as these sharks can often mistake white gloves for fish, which is when you could end up losing a hand. ‘Swimmers aren’t in danger from these sharks. They are highly unlikely to bite humans. ‘These sharks were over two metres long, but one of them swam off when it got a jellyfish sting on the nose. 'The warmer weather has brought more jellyfish closer in too, and there were lots in the water. I think the shark thought it was a bit of mackerel and went in too close.’ Nick Robertson-Brown gets up close and personal with a blue shark off the coast of Penzance .

"Tribunal: Stella English, the winner of the Apprentice 2010, is claiming constructive dismissal against her former mentor, Lord Sugar (pictured leaving the hearing) When she won The Apprentice, Stella English expected Lord Sugar to make her work hard for her £100,000 salary. Instead, she ended up as an ‘ostracised’  and ‘overpaid lackey’, she told a tribunal. Miss English, who is suing Lord Sugar for constructive dismissal, said she felt nothing like his ‘apprentice’ because she saw him only five times in her 13 months with his company. When he told her he wasn’t renewing her contract, he said he had only moved her to another post to avoid embarrassment for him if she resigned, before adding: ‘But the fact is that I don’t give a s***.’ In 2010, Miss English, 34, joined the sixth series of the BBC1 show with 15 other contestants, and in September began a three-month trial with Viglen as part of the selection process, a post that she continued in after winning the show in December. Describing her first day at the firm which supplies IT equipment to academy schools, she said: ‘No specific duties were allocated to me. I was provided with a desk and a phone but that was pretty much it.’ Miss English, a mother of two from Whitstable, Kent, told the tribunal in East London which Lord Sugar, 65, attended, that the job was a ‘sham’ because the post had previously been filled by a woman on a salary of £35,000. ‘My reasons for going on to The Apprentice was to be an apprentice and to be mentored by Lord Sugar,’ said Miss English, who earned £82,500 a year as the only female trading manager at Japanese investment bank Daiwa before going on the show. Scroll down for video . Exit: Stella English lasted only 13 months after winning The Apprentice in 2010 . ‘I didn’t believe that they would pay me £100,000 a year to do anything less than £100,000 worth of work. ‘The career-enhancing opportunities that The Apprentice position had been sold as simply failed to materialise.’ Claim: Ms English (pictured with Lord Sugar) told the hearing: 'The career-enhancing opportunities that The Apprentice position had been sold as simply failed to materialise' She said she emailed her boss, Bordan . Tkachuk, after discovering the company had made an annual profit of . £800,000 despite a £60million turnover and noticing that projects worth . £1.4million had not been invoiced. Miss English cried as she told the . tribunal that his reply – which was copied to all her colleagues – said: . ‘I don’t know what you’re doing but this ain’t how things work around . here.’ Miss English then emailed Lord Sugar and asked to discuss the problem. When she arrived at their meeting, Mr Tkachuk was there. She said that she was upset when Lord . Sugar asked him what he thought of her and Mr Tkachuk replied: ‘Nice . girl. Don’t do a lot.’ Miss English said: ‘They had never said this to . me.’ She ‘continued to be marginalised’ and in May 2011 told Lord Sugar in a phone call: ‘I have tried so hard . for so long and it’s not working. I’m an overpaid lackey at Viglen.’ She told the tribunal: ‘My pride . would not allow me to continue doing it.’ In June 2011, Miss English . began a job at Lord Sugar’s internet set-top box consortium YouView. Last weekend, it was announced that Lord Sugar had left YouView after a boardroom argument. Miss English claimed she had similar . problems at YouView and was called to a meeting on September 28, 2011, . where Lord Sugar told her he was not renewing her contract. Turned sour: Ms English said her role with Viglen made her an 'overpaid lackey' and she has accused Lord Sugar of forcing her out . She said he told her he had only . offered her the YouView role because he was worried about ‘adverse . publicity’ for The Apprentice, the BBC or his own image if she resigned. He added: ‘But the fact is that I don’t give a s***.’ Miss English said: ‘I could not . believe what he was saying. I was in absolute shock. I’d given two years . of my life to be told by somebody that “I don’t give a s***”. All the . effort that I’d put in – to be told this was so unnecessary.’ Under cross-examination from Seamus . Sweeney, representing Lord Sugar, Miss English said she did not remember . being told that The Apprentice winner might not work directly with Lord . Sugar. In 2011, The Apprentice’s prize was changed to a £250,000 investment to help the winner start a company. Victory: Stella beat rival Chris Bates in the 2010 final of the show but she said the job was not what she hoped . Winner: Stella English, pictured on her first day, was a young woman with no qualifications who rose to a highly-paid role as a management boss before winning the BBC show three years ago . The tribunal heard filming of the TV . series took place from September to November 2009, with Ms English going . away as a semi-finalist along with Chris Bates. It was not televised until the following autumn, while her probationary period with Viglen took place from September 2010 to December of that year, before the final episode of the programme was filmed and she was crowned the winner. During cross-examination from Seamus Sweeney, representing Lord Sugar, Ms English admitted she had been given a 'talk of doom' by the series producers, as had all the other entrants. In it, they were warned of the potential media publicity they would get from taking part and that it was not advisable for them to leave their current jobs entirely in case they did not win. Ms English said her employers had given her a sabbatical while filming took place, but she quit the company to go and work at Viglen. She said she did not remember being told that the winner might not work directly with Lord Sugar, adding that she understood they had in previous series. 'I didn't believe that they would pay me £100,000 a year to do anything less than £100,000 worth of work,' she said. 'My reasons for going on to The Apprentice was to be an apprentice and to be mentored by Lord Sugar.' But she admitted: 'I had my own interpretation of what the job was going to be. Nobody had ever said ""this is what it's going to be"".' Earlier, Lord Sugar sniggered as the . tribunal was played clips of the TV show, in which he is described as . 'Britain's most belligerent boss'. Ms English said that on her first day at Viglen Mr Tkachuk looked at her with 'contempt' and told her: 'There is no job.' She said she often witnessed him displaying an 'aggressive manner'. But she said she did not say anything to Lord Sugar as she 'didn't want to be a troublemaker'. The tribunal was adjourned until today.

"Arsenal fear Aaron Ramsey is set to be out for at least four weeks after suffering a hamstring injury against Leicester City on Wednesday night, but remain hopeful Alexis Sanchez will recover quickly from a knee injury. Ramsey lasted only nine minutes before succumbing to a third hamstring strain of the campaign - with Mathieu Flamini taking the 24-year-old's position. Speaking of Ramsey's injury after Arsenal's 2-1 Premier League win against Leicester, Arsene Wenger said: 'I cannot say it is not a worry, It is not good news.' Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey (right) lasted just nine minutes after coming on a substitute on Tuesday . Ramsey (left) was replaced by Mathieu Flamini after pulling his hamstring for the third time this season . Arsenal fear Ramsey (centre) could be out of action for at least four weeks . Middlesbrough (February 2) Crystal Palace (February 21) Monaco (February 25) Everton (March 1) QPR (March 4) West Ham (March 14) The Gunners moved back above Tottenham and Manchester United, who host Burnley on Wednesday evening, with an edgy victory over bottom club Leicester, which saw both Ramsey and Alexis Sanchez pick up injuries. It was far from an all-conquering display Wenger's men as they aimed to recover from defeat in the north London derby, but they looked comfortable leading 2-0 at half-time before allowing a spirited comeback from the Foxes. Arsenal look to have avoided a double injury blow, however, as star man Sanchez is expected to miss no more that one game and even that would be as a precaution. The 26-year-old started the midweek clash at the Emirates, after returning from a hamstring injury, but hurt his left knee and was under-par until he was replaced on 68 minuted by striker Olivier Giroud. Arsenal face a double  blow after Alexis Sanchez (pictured) and Ramsey suffered injuries vs Leicester . Sanchez (top) injured his knee following a collision with Leicester defender Matthew Upson . The incident came following a tackle by Leicester defender Matthew Upson, that left the 26-year-old nursing his knee with ice once he was substituted. After the game, Sanchez later delivered a cryptic tweet hinting that his injury may have been more than a 'knock' as Wenger claimed. 'Sometimes the love for the game and anxiety to be on a football pitch works against you,' he tweeted. The Chile international had missed the Gunners' previous two Premier League games against Aston Villa and arch-rivals Tottenham, and it is unclear at the moment if he will now be available for their FA Cup fifth round home clash against Championship leaders Middlesbrough on Sunday. Jack Wilshere looks set to return to Arsenal's matchday squad this weekend for their FA Cup fifth round match against Middlesbrough.

"Most people do one of two things with old video game consoles: they either leave them in an attic gathering dust to be used during rare moments of nostalgia, or they’re sold on at a car boot sale. But that’s not the case for software engineer Greig Stewart from Glasgow, who modified an old Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) to make it capable of playing music. His creation, dubbed the ‘NES Keytar’, uses a chip within the system to make sounds - and he has shown the potential of the musical instrument by playing the Game of Thrones theme tune. Scroll down for video . Software Engineer Greig Stewart from Glasgow has revealed his amazing NES Keytar invention (pictured). Using an old Nintendo console, a Guitar Hero controller and keys, the inventor has been able to coax out sounds from a chip in the old console and make it recreate popular music such as the Game of Thrones theme tune . The system uses an original NES console as its main ‘board’. Attached to the console are keys, which in turn trigger an original RP2A03 sound chip in the console to give an 8-bit sound. - NES console . - Guitar Hero controller . - Famicom controller . - NES controller . - Toy keyboard . - Three Mini Arduinos (microcontrollers) - Raspberry Pi . - MaxM LEDs . - Midi IN/OUT connections . - MidiNES / Chip Maestro . A Guitar Hero controller, meanwhile, acts as the fret for the keytar. ‘The project was started way back in August 2013 purely as a hobby project,’ Stewart, who is a musician in his spare time, told MailOnline. ‘Since then I've spent roughly 300 hours upping my electronics skills, learning new programming languages, trying different combinations of parts and writing all the software features - not to mention writing the music! ‘Debugging and testing took the longest time by far, and I'm still finding bugs! ‘All in all it was definitely more complex than I'd anticipated.’ To the get the final system up and running Stewart reveals that the system cost ‘a lot more than it should have’ and he had to go through more than one console to get everything working. ‘Luckily it didn’t blow up like one of my previous projects did’ he adds. The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) is an 8-bit video game console that was gradually released around the world from 1983 to 1987. It remains one of the best-selling gaming consoles of all time - but it's unlikely many used it in the same way Stewart has done . Amazingly, the console is also still able to play games without any problems – in fact, Stewart said ‘it works better than it did before I started.’ This is because he ‘cleaned and replaced some of the internal contacts that had started to deteriorate (no more blowing into cartridges required!), and upgraded the audio outputs to give a much cleaner sound with less buzz.’ Stewart, who was on Britain's Got Talent in 2012 with his equally impressive laser harp, also reveals he has some other ideas in the works, but he isn’t ready to reveal them just yet. ‘I have quite a few ideas that I came up with while building the NESKeytar,’ he said, ‘but for now I'm going to keep them under wraps.’ No doubt many fans of his latest effort, including Wil Wheaton of Star Trek fame who called the invention ‘amazing’ on Twitter, will be looking forward to seeing what he dreams up next.","Software engineer from Glasgow unveiled his 8-bit NES Keytar in a video .

"Mario Balotelli arrived at Liverpool last summer as a young man perceived to be entering the last-chance saloon, but on the back of a scoring record at Milan that would make him one of the hottest strikers in the current Premier League season, if replicated. Contradictory? Absolutely. But therein lies the enigma of Balotelli, who has held immense promise but a matching capacity to be distracted ever since Roberto Mancini bought him for Inter Milan from Lumezzane as a young teenager almost eight years ago. But having finally scored his first Premier League goal for Liverpool, and crucially the winner, in Tuesday night’s 3-2 win over Tottenham, he will deliver at Anfield, eventually. That at least is his recurring promise and although with Balotelli the ride is never smooth, there are real signs that he won back the faith of his manager Brendan Rodgers, is gelling with his team-mates - and that he wants to show the fans he is worth the £16million fee and £5m-a-year in wages. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Star Man Season Stats: Mario Balotelli . Mario Balotelli fires home the winner for Liverpool as they edge out Tottenham at Anfield on Tuesday . Balotelli's goal was his first in the Premier League for Liverpool having arrived last summer from AC Milan . Balotelli was immediately mobbed by his team-mates as Liverpool moved to within a point of Tottenham . The Italian striker did not raise a smile however, despite helping Liverpool close in on the top four . As he said with a mixture of bite and humility in a grinning Instagram post after the Spurs win: 'This smile is ONLY for those that always believe and support me. Thank you and forza Liverpool. But now head down and keep working hard. Tonight is past.' Certainly his league goal drought for Liverpool is in the past, his vital strike against Spurs taking his club tally to three now, after a Champions League goal over Ludogorets in September and a Capital One Cup win against Swansea the following month. But then goals have generally not been a big problem in his career, when he’s had periods of stability. Statistics alone never tell the whole story and that’s especially true with Balotelli. But the hard numbers show he has got better with age, despite the many, many hiccups, be they fireworks, bib troubles, bust-ups with team-mates and managers, failed Hollywood back-heels, social media gaffes, and on and on. Between 17 and 20 at Inter, he scored 20 league goals in 59 games for a hit rate of  34 per cent. At Manchester City, where he was generally accepted as a maddening flop, his rate of 20 goals in 54 Premier League games actually rose to 37 per cent. Balotelli opened his account for Liverpool against Ludogorets in September and now has three goals . Balotelli posted this picture and caption on Instagram after he helped his side to victory against Tottenham . Balotelli has consistently posted pictures and messages alluding to his love of the club and his team-mates . And in 18 months in Milan from early 2013 to last summer, he scored 26 league goals in 43 games, a strike rate of more than 60 per cent. The only players doing better in the current Premier League season are Diego Costa (17 in 19 for 89 per cent), Sergio Aguero (14 in 19, 74 per cent), Charlie Austin (13 in 19, 68 per cent) and Harry Kane (13 in 21, 62 per cent). You want something counter-intuitive? Balotelli arrived at Anfield in the form of the current Harry Kane, but with several tons of baggage. The hope for everyone at Liverpool is he now comes good; the evidence is that as his confidence grows, he feels - and demonstrates, principally via social media - part of the unit. When he’s not watching Peppa Pig with his two-year-old daughter, Pia, his posts of himself with his team-mates or of his team-mates have come on his ‘good’ days. The day he scored against Ludogorets he posted pictures of Steven Gerrard and Raheem Sterling. The away win at Sunderland when he was a substitute was a team shot inside the dressing room captioned ‘Oh yes.’ Last month as his only involvement in one of the League Cup ties with Chelsea was watching it on his telly, he posted a photograph of himself doing so. The caption read: ‘This illness might prevent me from helping my team on the pitch but it will NOT stop me from supporting my team off the pitch!! come on guys.’ And then two days later, he posted a picture of himself with Daniel Sturridge. ‘Can’t wait,’ he said, obviously referring to their potential partnership. Rodgers then knocked him back by dropping him for the FA Cup tie at home to Bolton, but also made it clear there was a way back with hard work. 'I think we have shown here a number of times with players that have been out of the fold, for various reasons, that if they work hard in training, show the intensity and show the focus then they have every chance of getting back in the team - and not only getting back in it but staying in it,’ he said. ‘The opportunity is there for Mario, and for every player - not just him.’ Balotelli has been supported by manager Brendan Rodgers despite struggling to make an impression . Mario Balotelli's banner at Anfield which reads in English 'I have nothing to declare except my genius' Balotelli posted the message: 'The time will come when everyone will get what they deserve' on Instagram . He made it back. The comeback win over Bolton in the replay was followed by more convivial footage with team-mates: Sterling, Sturridge and Jordan Ibe, all dancing at the Melwood training ground with Balotelli joining in. Balotelli has been promising since October he would come good, since fans displayed a banner saying he had nothing to declare but his genius. ‘Wow thanks to whoever did this,’ he said then. ‘I know all of you expect more from me... More goals especially and more genius but give me time and I'll show is true.’ Then just last week, in Italian, he posted a new quote: ‘Arriverà il momento dove ognuno avrà quel che si merita' (‘The time will come when everyone will get what they deserve'). He clearly expects to come good.","Mario Balotelli scored his first Premier League goal for Liverpool .

"If your favourite vacuum cleaner is the type that threatens to suck up the entire carpet, the furniture and the family pet, prepare for some bad news. Many of the best cleaners currently on sale are to be banned under an EU energy efficiency drive which comes into force next month. Those who want a powerful model have been urged to act quickly and buy their new machine before it sells out. Banned: VAX Power 3 U88– P3–B (2000 W) (left), Bosch BSG8PRO1 (1800w) (centre) and Miele S5281 (2200w) - rated as a 'best buy' by Which? reviewers - are among the models that will be prohibited .

Consumer magazine Which? said the ban will spell the end of many vacuums its testers rate among the best on sale. Here are five of Britain's most popular vacuum cleaners that will be banned when the new regulations are introduced . 1. Hoover Spirit TSP2101 (2100w) 2. Miele S5281 (2200w) 3. VAX Power 3 U88– P3–B (2000 W) 4. Samsung CycloneForce Sensor (2100w) 5. Bosch BSG8PRO1 (1800w) ... And four top selling models on Amazon.co.uk that will be banned by 2017 . 1.

Sebo X4EXTRA Automatic Upright Vacuum Cleaner (1,300W) Of seven models the magazine has rated as a ‘best buy’ since January 2013, five have motors above 1,600 watts. The . European Commission said the rules, intended to help tackle climate . change by cutting energy usage across Europe, will lead to ‘better . vacuum cleaners than ever before’. But . Ukip MEP Louise Bours claimed the legislation will do nothing to help . climate change, with lower-powered vacuums succeeding only in making . ‘life harder for house-proud householders’. The maximum wattage will be lowered further to 900 watts by 2017. Current cleaners have an average of 1,800 watts. Which? says: ‘If you’re in the market for a powerful vacuum, you should act . quickly, before all of the models currently available sell out. ‘A . best buy 2,200-watt vac costs around £27 a year to run in electricity – . only £8 more than the best-scoring 1,600-watt we’ve tested.’ An . EU energy label will be introduced, giving vacuum cleaners A to G . ratings for energy use, cleaning performance on carpets and hard floors, . and dust emissions. The label also requires a minimum level of . performance for the vacuum to be sold in the EU. 'Act quickly': Which? has warned consumers that vacuum cleaner models such as the Samsung CycloneForce Sensor (2100w) (left) and Hoover Spirit TSP2101 (2100w) will sell out ahead of the new regulations . Specification: A sample of the label that manufacturers will put on all vacuum cleaners . But . the scheme is self-regulating, meaning that manufacturers will create . their own labels, and Which? said it was unclear if the results would be . corroborated by an independent third party. Sir . James Dyson, whose company pioneered ‘bagless’ cleaners and campaigned . for a cap on wattage, said the eco-labels could be misleading because . they did not take account of the cost of ‘consumables’ – vacuum bags and . filters, which often cannot be recycled. He said: 'A label should help people choose high performing, energy efficient technology not hide important information. 'The environmental impact of bags and filters is ignored. And the label misleads people by showing the energy scores of vacuum cleaners tested without dust inside. 'Machines should be tested for real world conditions, not just for a Brussels test lab – that’s why we’re taking it to judicial review at the European Courts.' Ukip . health spokesman Miss Bours said a cut in vacuum motor power may affect . those with lung conditions such as asthma, which ‘can be exacerbated by . dust mite allergy’. Marlene . Holzner, the European Commission’s energy spokesman, says the amount of . wattage does not automatically indicate how well a vacuum will perform. What counted was how efficiently a vacuum translated its electrical . power into picking up dust, which would be measured under the new rules. The measures will also be extended to appliances, including water heaters and tumble dryers. The . Association of Manufacturers of Domestic Appliances said: ‘The industry . has been working on designs to meet the requirements, as well as . overcome any concerns about how lower power outputs may affect . performance.’ Since the 2010 general election Brussels has handed down almost 3,600 pieces of new regulation and directives affecting British businesses. Last year, European Union officials came close to banning olive oil jugs and dipping bowls from restaurants. The plan, which would have forced restaurateurs to only serve oil in its original bottles, with tamper-proof lids was withdrawn following extensive opposition. There was proposed EU legislation to ban the Union flag, along with flags and signs representing Scotland, Wales and Ireland from packs of meat. Some of the world’s most popular perfumes - including Chanel No 5 - are under threat from planned EU regulations that target perfumiers with ingredient bans and labelling requirements aimed at protecting a tiny fraction of consumers who suffer from allergies. In May it emerged that best-before dates on kitchen cupboard items such as tinned goods and olive oil could be scrapped after several EU countries warned that they lead to the waste of million of tons of food a year. The EU has also proposed regulations on anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay, the labelling of spirits and the use of rosemary extracts in certain low-fat meat and fish products.","New European Commission rules ban cleaners with more than 1,600 watts .

"At the biggest Premier League clubs, specifically at Manchester United, Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal, with Liverpool on their tails, it is expected that the average first-team wage in five years' time will be £10million per player per season, or £200,000 per week. And while the average 'top club' player will routinely be earning the kind of sums reserved at the moment for the best of the best in English football, it is entirely plausible that the best of the best will be on £500,000 per week or more. The best young players in the division - the likes of Raheem Sterling, Eden Hazard and Ross Barkley - appear among the most likely candidates to command half-a-million pounds per week in the coming seasons, a figure which equates to £26m per year. The Premier League will continue to be shown on Sky Sports and BT Sport until 2019 in a £5.136bn deal . Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao is already earning £285,000-a-week at Old Trafford . Liverpool's Raheem Sterling, pictured in action against Everton, is in line to earn huge wages in the future . Chelsea forward Eden Hazard is on the brink of agreeing a new £200,000-a-week deal at Stamford Bridge . By 2020, the average player in the Premier League will be earning around £5m per year, or £100,000 per week - and that stunning figure will be applicable even down to many of the 'smaller' teams, which might by then include the likes of Bournemouth or Brentford. And this is not idle fantasy, but a prediction using hard data based on what has happened over the 23-year history of the Premier League - and what is likely to happen next in the wake of the latest staggering TV deals. The League announced on Tuesday that they have sold the UK live rights to matches for the three season from 2016-17 to Sky and BT Sport for a combined £5.136 billion. When the foreign rights, near-live rights, clip rights and other commercial deals are done for the same period, it is expected the Premier League will have income of almost £9 billion for that three-year period, or close to £3bn per year. A large majority of that money will go to the clubs, and the biggest single expenditure of any club is, and will continue to be player wages. As the accompanying table shows, the rise and rise of Premier League wages has closely tracked the rise and rise in TV income. In the 1992-93 season the League as a whole earned £50.7m per year from TV deals, and the average first-team wage was around £120,000 per year, or £2,300 per week. The first Premier League UK TV deal with Sky last five years, and the second one lasted four years. By the third deal, TV income for the division was £520m a year - a tenfold increase on the first season. And the average first-team wage was approaching £1m a year. The numbers show us that player salaries among the elite have been rouhgly doubling every seven years up to now. The Premier League's current income is almost £2bn per year and the average first-team wage is £2.3m a year, and more than double that at the top clubs. With the new money announced yesterday arriving in club coffers from the 2016-17 season, acceleration of wages is expected after that, although there will also be year on year increases until then. Arsenal's Thierry Henry and his fellow professionals earned an average of £680,000-a-year back in 2001 . Premier League players earned an average of £1.6m a year  in 2009, more than £1m less than they do now . Sky Sports have invested a huge amount of money into TV rights since the Premier League's inception . In three years' time, the rights for 2019-22 will be sold. The Premier League are famously reticent to make predictions over whether they will gain even more next time, but the trend remains upwards, not least with so many overseas markets still coming to maturity. Transfer spending has also grown significantly as TV income has grown. But it is wage packets that use the most cash each year - and they will continue to do so.","The Premier League have announced a new £5.136billion TV rights deal .
Top clubs expected to pay players an average of £200,000-a-week .
Biggest stars could command wages of £500,00-a-week or more .

"Frank Lampard says there is no point crying about Manchester City's form and believes Manuel Pellegrini's men can still overtake Chelsea in the race for the Barclays Premier League title. The former England midfielder admitted that City had endured a nightmare few weeks after they were dumped out of the FA Cup by Middlesbrough and left seven points behind his former club in the league. But speaking ahead of Wednesday night's trip to the Britannia Stadium to face Stoke City, Lampard said all is not lost. Frank Lampard is confident Manchester City can return to form and overtake Chelsea in the title race . Lampard, pictured against former club Chelsea, says there is no point crying over Man City's poor form . 'It's been a frustrating last month for us,' the 36-year-old explained. 'We were on a really good run through December, playing every three or four days but January seems to have broken our rhythm. 'We've had fewer games, results have turned and if you don't perform and you don't win, the points situation change. There's no point crying about it - all we can do is react and start winning games.' Defeat on Wednesday evening and victory for Jose Mourinho's seemingly-unstoppable machine over Everton at Stamford Bridge could see the gap extended to 10 points. But Lampard insists the end is not nigh. The 36-year-old admits January has broken Manchester City's rhythm after a good run through December . 'All teams have patches and we'll be judged at the end of the season,' he said. City could only secure a point against Hull City in a 1-1 draw on Saturday, which means they have won just one of their last six games. But Lampard thinks the point at Etihad Stadium after James Milner's late equaliser might be vital come May. 'I think it was a below par performance and if you are below par then you can struggle to create chances,' he said . 'Teams come to the Etihad knowing we have attacking quality. We dug a point out in the end so that was a small positive and now it's very important to get back on track. 'Sometimes you just need to wipe the slate clean, move on and we've a great opportunity to do that very quickly against Stoke.' Midfielder James Milner curled home an unstoppable free-kick to rescue Manchester City a point against Hull . Lampard spent Monday night with players and staff from New York City FC. The new MLS franchise will kick off their season in March and are in Manchester on a training trip. Last night they beat St Mirren 2-0 in their first ever competitive match.

"Specs appeal: Singer Sir Elton John is reported to have requested a room just for his collection of glasses while touring Brazil . He's famed for his eccentric variety of outlandish glasses and is no stranger to the odd diva episode. So it should come as no surprise that Sir Elton John is reported to have requested an extra hotel room on his current mini-tour of Brazil - just for his colourful collection of specs. The star is currently on a four show tour of the South American country celebrating 40 years of his Rocket Man album. And according to Brazil's Pampulha newspaper, the Goodbye Yellow Brick Road singer has told gig organisers in Belo Horizonte, south east Brazil, to reserve an extra room for his glasses collection. The singer is also said to have stipulated that the room must be kept at a constant temperature of 16C and that his suite must be adorned with flowers. He is believed to have demanded four two-metre high vases containing palm trees in his dressing room and seven other square vases, five containing 16 red roses and two with 16 white roses. But Aluizer Malab, responsible for Sir Elton's March 9 show at the city's Mineirao football stadium, said that nothing is too much trouble for tour organisers. He said: 'In general, he isn't that eccentric. They are reasonable requests. He is a very disciplined artist.' A spokesman for the singer denied the claim, insisting it was not true. The 65-year-old, real name Reg Dwight, is reportedly no stranger to making particular requests when on the road.

It has previously been reported that he demands a dressing room big enough to comfortably hold ten people with ample seating including a 6ft sofa, a 'love seat', an armchair and a selection of easy chairs. He is usually said to be adamant that floral displays should have 'absolutely no chrysanthemums, daisies, carnations or lilies'. Sir Elton is hardly the first popstar to make unusual requests however.

According to Rolling Stone magazine in Brazil, Sir Elton has said that he would like to eat traditional Brazilian food while in the country. As well as appearing in Belo Horizonte, Sir Elton is also performing in Porto Alegre tonight and Brasilia. Tickets for the shows range from $50 to $1,000.

"A North Carolina woman has proven once and for all that size does not matter when it comes to busting a move. Radio producer Whitney Way Thore's series of pulse pumping YouTube videos A Fat Girl Dancing has gone viral in recent months thanks to her impressive skills on the dance floor. Now Thore is using her newfound popularity to take her plus-size prosthelytizing to the masses. Scroll down for video... Having fun: Whitney Thore's A Fat Girl Dancing videos have gone viral thanks to her very impressive moves. Here, the North Carolina radio producer and her co-worker spoof the infamous Miley Cyrus/Robin Thicke duet . Feeling it: Thore is a life long dancer whose weight gain caused her to lose touch for a time with the pastime she once loved . The videos were in part the idea of her co-worker at 1075 KZL show Jared and Katie in the Morning, Jared Pike. 'I had the idea for No Body Shame Campaign after I posted photos of myself from a boudoir shoots,' Thore told DailyVenusDiva. 'While many responses were positive, there was a whoooole lotta fat-shaming going on! I started blogging really just for therapy.' But Pike knew of her awesome moves and suggested she make a video series as a way to cope. Over several months, the videos--which feature Thore dancing to songs by Robin Thicke, Pussy Cat Dolls and others--gained a solid following and recieved tens of thousands of views. And when she decided to put a recent dance video on Facebook, her popularity skyrocketed. 'Instead of posting a link to YouTube, I embedded the video directly into Facebook,' she said. 'This allowed it to become more visible and reach more people through the 150k+ shares!' Now Thore is getting compliments left and right and giving plenty of visibility to her No Body Shame Campaign, but things didn't always feel so bright. The lifelong dancer was teaching others the skill as early as 16, but weight gain too a serious toll on her confidence. 'Unable to face my reflection, I failed out of dance class my first semester,' she told the Huffington Post. Impressive: Thore's considerable dance skills and rediscovered positive self-image are both evident in the series of videos she's created called A Fat Girl Dancing . 'I am learning to practice aggressive self-love. I have lived my life as a 130-pound woman and as a 350-pound woman in North America, in Europe, and in Asia. Cultural norms, societal pressures, and the whims of the fashion industry do not define my worth as woman or a human being,' proclaims Thore . Sensation: Thore's latest video has been shared on Facebook over 100,000 times and her others video have racked up tens of thousands of views on YouTube . 'By the time I had graduated college, been diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, moved to Korea, and gained 200 pounds, I was finally able to dance socially, at a club or party, but never dreamed I would take a class or perform publicly ever again.'

"Tony Pulis has seemingly ended up on the wrong end of a prank call after a man impersonating Bolton boss Neil Lennon claimed to get through to the West Brom manager on his mobile phone. The prankster Blain Morrison had left the Baggies boss a voicemail asking him to return the call as he was interested in taking defender Gareth McAuley on loan. Pulis is said to have phoned back, and totally unaware that the man on the other end of the line isn't former Celtic manager Lennon, tells the man that he can't take McAuley because 'he plays every week'. West Brom boss Tony Pulis was apparently tricked by Blain Morrison who was impersonating Neil Lennon . Morrison, playing the part of Bolton boss Lennon, wanted to take Gareth McAuley to the Championship club .

"The top half of the Premier League table shows just how close the race for a place in the top four is . The race for the Champions League is shaping up to be the most tense in years. With Chelsea and Manchester City in a two-way fight for the Barclays Premier League title, five teams are battling it out for the remaining two spots in the coveted top four. Just three points separate Southampton in third spot and Liverpool in seventh, with Arsenal, Manchester United and Tottenham jostling in between. The riches of Europe's elite competition await the lucky two clubs who claim their places in the top four. With just over a third of the season to go, Sportsmail analyses the contenders' strengths and weaknesses... but who do you think will win the race? SOUTHAMPTON . REASONS THEY WILL MAKE THE TOP FOUR . Their mean defence. The Saints have conceded just 17 Premier League goals this season - the best defensive record in the top flight. Ronald Koeman has got his back-four, led by skipper Jose Fonte, well drilled. If they score, the likelihood is that Southampton leave with the points. REASONS THEY WON’T MAKE THE TOP FOUR . The lack of experience. Koeman has assembled a young and vibrant squad down at St Mary's. But when it comes to the crunch do they have the knowhow and mettle to go the distance? We don't know the answer because we've not seen them in this position. But we're about to find out.

They've been there, seen it, done it, got all the memorabilia. Arsene Wenger's side are masters at timing their run perfectly to ensure they finish in the top four. So many times we've questioned their Champions League qualification credentials. They've not buckled, yet... REASONS THEY WON’T MAKE THE TOP FOUR . Their injuries. With a fully-fit squad at his disposal, Wenger has a team to challenge England and Europe's best. But his season has been beset by injuries to key men. And with doubts now over Alexis Sanchez and Aaron Ramsey following the win over Leicester, could this be the year they miss out?

Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney, Angel Di Maria and Radamel Falcao. Is there a better forward line in the continent? REASONS THEY WON’T MAKE THE TOP FOUR . Their inconsistencies. It's been a stop-start season for United. Just when you think they're are on a run, they falter. It's been a transitional season for Van Gaal, an injury-hit one at that, but if they continue to stop-start then they could be facing a second successive season out of Europe's elite club competition.

With Daniel Sturridge back fit and Raheem Sterling fully-charged after his winter break to Jamaica, the Reds are on a roll. REASONS THEY WON’T MAKE THE TOP FOUR .

"Marouane Fellaini insists that Manchester United's priority this season is to make a swift return to the Champions League. The former Premier League champions failed to qualify for Europe last term for the first time since 1995 and are currently competing with the likes of Arsenal, Southampton, Tottenham and Liverpool for a top four finish. Although manager Louis van Gaal has not ruled out a late challenge for the title, Fellaini believes those hopes should be reserved for next season. Marouane Fellaini (right) celebrates with Daley Blind after United rescue a draw against West Ham . The Belgium international insists a top four finish is the priority this season . Speaking to Goal.com at the launch of New Balance Football, the Belgium international said: 'It is important because Manchester United have to play in the Champions League, and we have the quality for that. 'We will see if we can win the league in 2015-16, but we have the FA Cup and Champions League qualification to aim for. Then we will see next season. Fellaini was heavily criticised during his first season at Old Trafford after arriving as former Everton manager David Moyes' first signing. Fellaini was widely criticised after arriving at Old Trafford as ill-fated David Moyes' (right) first signing . Theo Walcott's Arsenal are among four clubs chasing a Champions League finish this season . The Scot was eventually sacked after a dismal set of results saw United finish seventh in the table, having won the league the previous year under Sir Alex Ferguson. 'Last season was a bad one for us,' admitted Fellaini. 'Both for me and everyone at Manchester United it was disappointing. 'It was worse for me because I was the first signing for David Moyes, so I received all the criticism. 'I felt bad because I've known Moyes for a long time. I know he is a great man. Fellaini insists he will play anywhere that manager Louis van Gaal asks of him . The 27-year-old has forced himself into the reckoning under Van Gaal, although he has largely been used as an attacking alternative as opposed to his preferred defensive midfielder role. “I’m a midfielder. I like to play a bit more defensive, but it’s up the manager to choose. If you put me up front you know why you’re doing it. 'Wherever he tells me to play, that's where I play.

"McLaren racing director Eric Boullier is hoping the team's 'extreme' new car can rack up the miles over the remaining two tests if they are to head into the new Formula One season on a competitive footing. Over the four days of the initial pre-season test in Jerez last week drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button completed a total of just 79 laps. With new power-unit partner Honda on board McLaren were anticipating teething problems, and so it proved as there were numerous issues to contend with. Drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button give their thumbs up at the launch of the new Mclaren car . The McLaren-Honda MP4-30 was unveiled at the Honda Motor Co. HQ on Tuesday . But there was no doom and gloom amongst the McLaren hierarchy, nor with their illustrious driver pairing, but instead positivity they are progressing in the right direction. Boullier appreciates for the remaining two tests at the Circuit de Catalunya in Barcelona from February 19-22 and February 26-March 1, McLaren now have to build to ensure they do not languish too far behind their rivals come the opening race in Australia on March 15. 'With a new concept and engine partner, obviously the less we run the more difficult it's going to be to catch up, or let's say, the later we will be ready to compete,' said Boullier. 'Every time we can't achieve all our targets in terms of mileage or development we push back the date where we are able to exploit 100 per cent of our car and our power unit to fight for the win.' McLaren have pushed that development to the maximum with a tightly-packaged, streamlined rear that so far has ticked all the right boxes. 'You can see yourself the back end of the car is quite amazing,' added Boullier . 'The car is very small, something we embarked on with our partner to try for such a challenge. 'We have also pushed the limit of the cooling, which means we can run hotter engines with smaller radiators and cooling system. 'All this has resulted in a tinier car, one that is very extreme in terms of how small it is. 'That is why it was a relief last week to see the car running with no cooling issues which is a concern when you go radical or extreme.' The new Mclaren completed just 79 laps in total at testing in Jerez last week . Jenson Button drives ahead of the Ferrari of Kimi Raikkonen at Circuito de Jerez earlier this month . Both Alonso and Button have already expressed confidence with the car, notably its stability under braking on entry into the corners, crucial for driver control. The only area of concern for Boullier was seeing reigning champions Mercedes put on a virtual demonstration in Jerez as Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg completed a record 450 laps for a first test. 'What was frightening was the fact they did pit-stop training on the first day!' reflected Boullier. 'Their confidence level is very high. They had such an advantage in 2014, I don't see them failing in 2015. 'The only thing you can expect, or hope, is that everybody closes the gap.'","McLaren admit their new car needs work to be competitive next season .

"When asked who would be leading the 2015 goalscoring charts across Europe's top five leagues, most football fans would predict that either Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo would be top of the tree. In fact, there's one more very important name that has been making headlines in the Premier League for his ability to find the net since the turn of the year. When Harry Kane pulled Tottenham level against Liverpool on Wednesday night, he joined Barcelona star Messi on eight goals for 2015, which is more than any other player in England, Spain, Italy, France or Germany. Harry Kane celebrates scoring his eighth goal of the year during Tottenham's 3-2 defeat against Liverpool . Lionel Messi has scored eight goals in as many games for Barcelona since the turn of the year . Although his side ended up suffering a 3-2 defeat at Anfield on Wednesday, Kane added to his impressive tally of 13 Premier League goals for Mauricio Pochettino's side as the young striker looks to keep pace with the likes of Diego Costa, who leads the way with 17 goals to his name so far. Kane's form in front of goal has been rising quickly since his headed goal against Swansea in December, 2014. In fact, Kane hadn't scored a Premier League goal until November when Pochettino began to give the youngster a run in the team. Since then, the 21-year-old has bagged 12 goals in 15 games for the north London club. And since New Year's Day, Kane has helped Spurs put Chelsea, West Brom and Arsenal to the sword with some sensational solo performances. Kane scored the first two of his eight 2015 goals against London rivals Chelsea on January 1 in a game which saw the youngster terrorise one of the best defences in the Premier League as Spurs marched to a memorable 5-3 victory at White Hart Lane. The 20-year-old has now scored 13 Premier League goals for Spurs, including two against Arsenal . The former Leyton Orient loanee then added to his tally in the 2-1 defeat against Crystal Palace before bagging four goals in two games against West Brom and Arsenal in Saturday's north London derby. Messi, on the other hand, has managed to score eight goals in as many games for Barca as the diminutive Argentinian looks to propel his side to the top of La Liga. A hat-trick against Deportivo on January 18 was the highlight for Messi, who already has 33 goals in all competitions for the Catalan giants. Antoine Griezmann (left) and Mario Mandzukic (right) also feature in our top scorers in 2015 list . Spurs fans will no doubt enjoy 'one of their own' Kane keeping pace with Messi in a list which also includes Neymar, Mario Mandzukic and Gonzalo Higuain. Interestingly, Ronaldo is nowhere to be seen in our top 10 list after a difficult start to the year which has seen the Portuguese banned for two games after he was sent off against Cordoba and notching four goals - a measly tally by his almighty standards. The Spurs faithful may well start to wonder how long they can keep hold of Kane should the young Englishman continue to keep pace with Europe's elite. Despite scoring four goals in 2015, Cristiano Ronaldo has had a difficult start to the year .","Harry Kane and Lionel Messi have both scored eight goals in 2015 .

"Tony Morley, the man who struck the most famous cross in Aston Villa history, was in the press room at the KC Stadium on Tuesday night poring over some statistics. He observed in the matchday programme how his club still holds the fourth highest total of major honours in the history of English football, with only Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal collecting more silverware. Villa have won seven First Division Championships, seven FA Cups, five League Cups, and of course, in 1982, one European Cup. In the final against Bayern Munich, Morley delivered the ball converted by Peter Withe to seal forever a moment to cherish for Villa fans. Joe Cole (left) and Christian Benteke (right) look dejected during Aston Villa's defeat to Hull City . Goalscorer Peter Withe (l) and Nigel Spinks (r) pose with the European Cup after beating Bayern Munich 1-0 . Paul Lambert is under pressure at Aston Villa with the fans on his back . Derby have been able to call on £65,000-per-week Bent, who has commanded almost £50m in transfer fees during his career, during a loan spell in the Championship. The England international has scored four goals in five games, after Paul Lambert lost trust with the striker, who cost Villa £24m. Throw in the European Super Cup secured the following season and it is 21 genuine trophies, one ahead of Chelsea. Those positions will surely be reversed by this season’s close. Two clubs going in opposite directions, much of Villa’s success came many years ago – six league crowns before 1910. Eleven of Chelsea’s honours have come since July 2003. It does not take the sharpest brain to spot the correlation between that growing trophy cabinet and Roman Abramovich’s enormous investment. Villa believed they had their own sugar daddy when American Randy Lerner came to town in August 2006. Initially, they very much did. Lerner pumped in many millions during Martin O’Neill’s reign, signing the likes of Ashley Young, James Milner and Stewart Downing for eight-figure fees. Three consecutive top six finishes followed and a place among the gilded corridors of Champions League football seemed close, as recently as 2010. But Lerner felt compelled to run his ship on more streamlined terms, falling out with O’Neill in the process. Still, Darren Bent arrived for a club-record transfer, initially worth £18m, in January 2011 under Gerard Houllier. Even out on loan at Derby County, Villa pick up more than two thirds of his £65,000 per week wages. Darren Bent fell out of favour at Aston Villa but has scored four goals in five games for Derby County . Aston Villa spent many millions during Martin O'Neill's reign, including on Ashley Young from Watford . The Villa fans present a 'Lambert Out' banner at the KC Stadium on Tuesday night . Overall Lerner is estimated to have ploughed into the club £300million of his own money – racking up sizeable Villa losses. These funds have declined in recent years as Lerner has lost interest, but he has opened the cheque-book on occasions too. Paul Lambert’s record purchase is £7million Christian Benteke. Tom Cleverley would have been bought for £8m had Everton’s late interest not materialised forcing the loan option. Carles Gil arrived for £3.2m this January. Frees such as Joe Cole, Philippe Senderos and Kieran Richardson were brought in for this season, and Scott Sinclair’s January move from Manchester City stalled at the £2.5m asking price, before an initial temporary switch was agreed. Demba Ba’s £80,000 per week wages were not even countenanced, but a £5m bid for Rickie Lambert was made on deadline day. Lambert’s net spend at Villa stands at £44m, with much dribbled away on European gambles such as Aleksander Tonev, Nicklas Helenius, and Antonio Luna. That total is more than Everton have paid and recouped over the same period, more than Tottenham. Villa’s failure to sell any players of great significance over this time is key, and Lambert cannot compete with the wages on offer at White Hart Lane. (Steve Bruce’s Hull have a net spend greater than £60m.) Villa slipped into the relegation zone of the Premier League after the defeat . Dame N'Doye of Hull City celebrates after scoring the second goal of the game . Lerner wants out, make no mistake. After searching privately for many months, he publicly placed the club up for sale last May and, despite claims he subsequently became ‘re-energised’, continues to invite a buyer. Just who would be interested at the £200m price Lerner wants as Villa dip below the dotted line of relegation remains to be seen. These are critical times and an asset in the Championship plunges in value, particularly in light of the astronomical domestic television deal struck by the Premier League worth £5.1billion. Quite when Lerner will study Villa’s utterly rudderless 2-0 defeat at Hull City from his residence across the Atlantic is uncertain. He last attended a Villa match in September, the visit of Arsenal when Lambert’s side had won three, drawn one of their opening four Premier League fixtures. That was Lerner’s first game in person in two years and it seems unlikely he will be returning to ‘enjoy’ his club any time soon. They have not won in ten Premier League games, failed to score in 15 all season. Randy Lerney has only been present at one game this season, the 3-0 home defeat to Arsenal . Lerner installed a new chief executive last summer in Tom Fox, drafted from Arsenal, to raise the commercial pull of a club rich in history. The idea was for Lambert to push Villa up the Premier League table while Fox implemented changes to make the club self-sustainable. That plan is under serious threat. Lambert faced renewed calls for his head from Villa fans at the KC Stadium, a banner unfurled reading “Lambert Out’ and chants to the same effect. After the game, a group of travelling supporters waited by the team bus to confront the squad. Villa will remain in the bottom three for ten days at least, with Leicester in the FA Cup next on Sunday. Fox said it was a ‘false narrative’ to blame the manager, but that provided little succour to supporters long starved of aspirations. Villa are in a downward spiral with a shortage of hope. While this trouble has been a long-time coming, something now has to change, and quick.

"It would be difficult to argue that Louis van Gaal has got the most out of his Manchester United squad after spending £150million on new players last summer. West Ham boss Sam Allardyce criticised United's long-ball style following Sunday's 1-1 draw at Upton Park, a game in which Daley Blind rescued a point for the visitors in added time. United have looked unbalanced at times this season, while Van Gaal's decision to drop Wayne Rooney into midfield as Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao struggle continues to confuse. So with United coming under pressure to find the right formula, Sportsmail's experts have picked the starting XIs they believe would be most effective, regardless of injuries or suspensions. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney has been used in midfield for much of this season . Louis van Gaal defended his tactics against West Ham in his pre-match press conference on Tuesday . Ian Ladyman . (4-3-2-1) De Gea; Rafael, Evans, Rojo, Shaw; Herrera, Carrick, Blind; Di Maria, Rooney; Van Persie . The back four here contains the squad's two natural full-backs and its two best nuts and bolts central defenders. Herrera needs a chance in midfield and his selection allows Rooney to be pushed further up the field. Van Persie is on borrowed time but remains United's best finisher. Striker Robin van Persie, pictured scoring against Leicester, has struggled to hit top form this season . Ander Herrera, pictured coming on for Angel di Maria, has made just six Premier League starts this season . Neil Ashton . (4-3-2-1) De Gea; Jones, Evans, Rojo, Shaw; Blind, Carrick; Mata, Di Maria, Valencia; Rooney . Van Gaal will spend 90 minutes with his hands over his eyes whatever defence he picks, but at least Rojo looks increasingly solid. Blind looks decent in the centre and Carrick can keep things ticking over alongside him in the engine room. Daley Blind, pictured celebrating against West Ham, has been a calming influence in United's midfield . This team relies on the attacking value sand principles of the club, turning to wingers - Mata and Valencia - and create from both sides. Then it's up to Rooney to score the goals. Van Persie and Falcao can wait for it all to go wrong on the bench before Van Gaal throws them on in desperation. Antonio Valencia (left) tussles with West Ham's Enner Valencia during United's 1-1 draw at Upton Park . Chris Wheeler . (4-2-3-1) De Gea; Valencia, Jones, Rojo, Shaw; Carrick, Blind; Mata, Rooney, Di Maria; Van Persie. A flat back-four (ideally with a new right-sided centre-back sooner rather than later), Rooney in a more advanced role, the right pegs in the right holes. Former Chelsea midfielder Juan Mata has found himself in and out of Van Gaal's starting XI this season . Angel di Maria, pictured celebrating against QPR in September, has struggled for form after a fine start . Dominic King . (4-2-3-1) De Gea; Rafael, Evans, Rojo, Shaw; Carrick, Blind; Di Maria, Fellaini, Mata; Rooney . First of all Wayne Rooney needs to play in his best position as a central striker, given that Falcao and van Persie are in wretched form. Fellaini's height and physical strength would be effective against Burnley's direct probing, not to mention being useful at the other end of the pitch. Juan Mata is an excellent player and deserves a chance ahead of Ander Herrera. Giant midfielder Marouane Fellaini (left) has been used as an impact substitute by Van Gaal at times . David de Gea, pictured making a save against West Ham, is the undoubted No 1 goalkeeper at United . Matt Barlow . (4-4-2) De Gea; Rafael, Jones, Rojo, Shaw; Januzaj, Carrick, Blind, Di Maria;Rooney, Van Persie . It's flawed but it's balanced and in a straightforward system that everyone should understand. There's pace out wide, control in the centre and two goal scorers up front with the intelligence to react if an extra body is required in midfield. Ideally, it would be stronger at the back and there fouls be more energy in the centre but the squad is off kilter. Adnan Januzaj (right) has admitted struggling with the defensive duties given to him by Van Gaal this season . Luke Shaw (right), pictured tackling Everton's Aiden McGeady, is included in each of Sportsmail's XIs . Sami Mokbel . (4-3-1-2) De Gea; Rafael, Evans, Rojo, Shaw; Carrick, Blind, Rooney; Di Maria; Van Persie, Falcao . I desperately tried to fit Di Maria, Rooney, Falcao and Van Persie into the team - and I think I've managed it. I've slotted Rooney into midfield - but with the license to push forward when United are in possession. The balance of this side is probably all wrong, it would concede goals. But they'd score a few, too. On-loan striker Radamel Falcao celebrates a rare goal against Leicester at Old Trafford in January .

"The pressure on beleaguered Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert has increased further after an influential local newspaper called for his immediate sacking. The Birmingham Mail have risked punishment by Villa for their stance but pulled no punches by demanding the club axe the 45-year-old Scot. Under a piece titled 'Birmingham Mail says: Lambert must go!', the paper makes its outspoken stance after the club dropped into the Barclays Premier League relegation zone following their latest dismal defeat.

'But this great club is now on its knees and the Holte End is hurting - and we can no longer stand by and watch that happen. 'Today the Birmingham Mail makes one simple, stark request to the Aston Villa board: sack the manager.' Tuesday's 2-0 loss at fellow relegation-battlers Hull leaves Villa third bottom of the table and many of their fans are demanding change. Lambert with Scott Sinclair during Villa's latest defeat, a 2-0 reverse at Hull on Tuesday . Christian Benteke (right) shows the strain during the Hull defeat as the club dropped into the relegation zone . Jores Okore's strike in Saturday's defeat against Chelsea was Villa's first goal in exactly 11 hours of football. Since Boxing Day, Villa have not won in eight games and are easily in the worst form of any top-flight club. 'We do not say this lightly, nor do we take any pleasure in saying that Lambert should go,' continues the Birmingham Mail, who then claim that he is not the man to save the club from relegation. That would be a 'disaster financially, and one from which Villa may never recover.' Lambert is also accused of being responsible for 'poor, and too often dull, performances' and 'awful football, declining attendances, and post-match excuses that beggar belief'. Villa supporters unveiled a 'Lambert out' banner at the KC Stadium with feeling mounting against the boss . 'Villa must act now - before it’s too late,' the piece urges before concluding: 'Enough is enough.' Meanwhile, former Villa striker Andy Gray has also put the boot into Lambert. '(Villa) have got all the hallmarks of a team that is going down,' Gray told talkSPORT. 'Paul comes out every week and says, ""we played quite well today"". That might be the case, but they are not winning football matches, and they don’t look like winning football matches. 'I really worry for my old club. I am not one for seeing people lose their jobs, but sometimes change is necessary. 'Paul is a great lad, but it just hasn’t worked for him at Villa.' Aston Villa is a proud and noble name in English football. It is an historic club at the heart of our community, a founding father of the beautiful game. But this great club is now on its knees and the Holte End is hurting - and we can no longer stand by and watch that happen. Today the Birmingham Mail makes one simple, stark request to the Aston Villa board: sack the manager. Paul Lambert is not the man to save this club from relegation and the long-term damage that disaster will bring. We do not say this lightly, nor do we take any pleasure in saying that Lambert should go. The Birmingham Mail has been as patient as many of the claret and blue fans, standing by and hoping things will improve. Despite the results, despite the performances. But time is now up. No progress has been made under Lambert. In fact, this once mighty club is now staring relegation in the face. A relegation that would cost the club a lucrative share of the new £2 billion Sky and BT television deal. Dropping down a division would be a disaster financially, and one from which Villa may never recover. As custodian of the club, Randy Lerner must ensure it doesn’t happen. Lambert has presided over just two Premier League victories in 20 matches since agreeing a bumper new four-year deal in mid-September. The poor, and too often dull, performances mean the team is last on Match Of The Day nearly every week - and at this rate destined for an even later Saturday night slot on the Football League show next season. That’s why Villa must act now - before it’s too late. Awful football, declining attendances, and post-match excuses that beggar belief. Aston Villa should not be aiming to survive - they should be aiming to strive, to compete in the higher reaches of the league. Long-ball football has been replaced by an equally unsuccessful possession-based style of play. Now the manager says his side must play ugly football to get themselves clear of relegation - and they will, he says. We don’t believe Lambert anymore. He is out of ideas, there is nothing left for him to say to his players that he hasn’t said already. We respect his integrity and loyalty, but the fans don’t want him. The fans deserve better. Enough is enough.","Paul Lambert is under fire due to Aston Villa's abysmal form .

"When Newcastle United signed Siem de Jong for just £6 million in July, Alan Pardew hailed the capture as a 'coup'. Once again the club's transfer model – headed by chief scout Graham Carr – was lauded as the envy of Europe. But De Jong was no secret – he was, after all, a title-winning Ajax captain and Holland international who had scored three times against Manchester City in the Champions League. Newcastle United midfielder Siem de Jong has been ruled out for at least eight weeks with a collapsed lung . The former Ajax star signed for Newcastle last summer for a £6million fee but has struggled with injuries . Why, then, did Newcastle land the attacking midfielder virtually unopposed and at a seemingly bargain price? Perhaps now we know. Worryingly, Newcastle should have known in the summer. It was confirmed on Tuesday that De Jong will miss the next two months because of a collapsed lung, the second time in 18 months he has been hospitalised with such a serious problem. Now a collapsed lung is scary enough, a recurring collapsed lung is terrifying. This isn't a calf, hamstring or thigh strain – although he has suffered from each of those – this is a vital organ breaking down, again. The 26-year-old was only days away from a return to action after five months out with a torn thigh muscle when the Magpies revealed he had undergone surgery on his lung. Before the thigh problem he had missed much of pre-season with a calf injury. Indeed, De Jong has made just one start and one substitute appearance in the Premier League for United. It was in August, 2013 that he was first sidelined with a collapsed lung. He returned but his progress was hampered by niggling muscle strains. In addition to his lung problems, De Jong's career has been blighted by a series of recurring muscle strains . Before his injury-hit 2013-2014 campaign, De Jong had scored over 15 goals in four consecutive seasons . Interestingly, Newcastle had been watching the player for 14 months before bringing him to Tyneside – Carr, Pardew and Peter Beardsley had all checked in on the elegant playmaker. They were prepared to discount last season and instead focused on his undoubted pedigree – for he'd barely missed a game during the previous four campaigns in which he scored north of 15 goals on each occasion. But De Jong's own comments about his initial lung episode – and his subsequent struggle for fitness – should read as a warning, and perhaps concern, for United going forward. 'It (the collapsed lung) was quite scary,' he said. 'It happened at the beginning of the season, and after that I had to be in bed for a couple of weeks. 'Looking back afterwards, we didn't focus enough on my entire body and focused too much on the lung. 'The lung was good after three weeks but the rest of the body just wasn't strong enough to play games, and that's what we forgot a little. 'During the season I had some other small injuries which was part of not being strong enough.' While playing for Ajax, De Jong scored three times against Manchester City in the Champions League . De Jong won four back-to-back Eredivisie titles between 2010 and 2014 and has six caps for Holland . And that is the worry for Newcastle, not only the fear of a recurrence, but the impact a collapsed lung has on the strength of the body. There is a precedent in these parts. Former Durham cricketer Mark Davies – brother of Bradford City defender, Andrew – twice suffered a collapsed lung during his career and was plagued by other injuries, eventually forcing his retirement last year. De Jong is unlikely to feature until the final weeks of this season, meaning his campaign will have been written-off by injury. Having signed him to a six-year contract, Newcastle can only hope we aren't writing that again. Newcastle fans will hope that the man hailed as Yohan Cabaye's replacement can return to full fitness soon .","Siem de Jong has been ruled out of action for at least eight weeks .

"John Inverdale has been axed from his role covering Wimbledon for BBC Radio 5 Live after he sparked a sexism storm last summer. The BBC was bombarded with complaints when Inverdale suggested French player Marion Bartoli - who went on to become women's champion - was 'not much of a looker'. Just days after Inverdale claimed the gaffe was due to hayfever, the corporation announced Clare Balding would be replacing him on the radio station for this year's tournament. Scroll down to hear Inverdale's comments about Bartoli . John Inverdale (left) is to be replaced by Clare Balding (right) on Radio 5 Live's coverage of Wimbledon a year after his on-air comments sparked accusations of sexism . Inverdale suggested French champion Marion Bartoli's father may have told her she'd never be 'a looker' Balding, 43, had previously been the station's Wimbledon host but the in-demand presenter was unable to front the coverage last year due to other commitments. Inverdale, 56, will continue to work on the BBC's tournament coverage with highlights on TV. A spokeswoman for the station said: 'We have a wide team of talent that work across TV and radio at Wimbledon and John is very much a part of this again this year, and will present the daily highlights programme on BBC2, Today At Wimbledon. 'Clare Balding reprises her presenting role on Radio 5 Live, which she has done before. Due to other commitments Clare was not part of the Wimbledon team last year.' In an interview earlier this week, Inverdale told how a bout of hayfever and efforts to fill airtime had been behind his comment last year. The incident caused such controversy that the then culture secretary Maria Miller wrote to BBC director-general Tony Hall about the remark. Inverdale (left) claimed this week that his comments about Bartoli (right) were caused by hayfever, adding: 'We're on air from 12 noon till 7pm with not a single word written' The TV host will still attend Wimbledon for the BBC, presenting a daily highlights programme on BBC2 . Inverdale told Radio Times magazine this week: 'I was feeling so ill that day, I had terrible hay fever and all I could think of was that I wanted to go home to bed. 'I had Andy Murray in the final the next day, I knew I had to be on form. 'Your mind is going all over the place, we're on air from 12 noon till 7pm with not a single word written and you've got to fill the time.' The BBC received around 700 complaints after Inverdale questioned whether Bartoli's father had told her, when she was younger, that she was never going to be a 'looker ... a Sharapova ... you're never going to be 5ft 11in, you're never going to be somebody with long legs, so you have to compensate for that'. The presenter later attempted to clarify the 'ham-fisted' comment and said that he had written to Bartoli to apologise for using a 'clumsy phrase'. He has since been signed up by ITV to work alongside Bartoli, 29, for coverage of the French Open, which starts this Sunday.","BBC in sexism storm last summer after Inverdale's on-air comments .

His agent, Bayram Tutumlu, told Sportsmail on Wednesday that Lekhwiya were unlikely to release the 50-year-old from his deal, which expires in June.

Tutumlu later told reporters: 'Laudrup is under contract with Qatari club Lekhwiya. Out of respect anyone interested in him should contact the club. 'I don't think they would let him go because the team are in so many tournaments and competitions.'

'In June his contract will finish and he will be free. I'm not sure if they will want compensation to let him go now, first QPR have to talk to them.

"Andy Murray backed up his stated intention that he intends to be more consistent outside the Grand Slams with an impressive return to action following his Australian Open disappointment. The 27 year-old Scot took only an hour and 33 minutes to overcome France's Nicolas Mahut 6-3 6-2 to make the second round of the extravagantly named ABN Amro World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam. Murray was back on court having given himself a four-day break following his loss to Novak Djokovic in the Australian final, when he had chances to claim a third Grand Slam title. British No 1 Andy Murray is currently playing in the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam . Murray marked his first match since his Australian Open final defeat to Novak Djokovic with a victory . Top seed Murray took one hour and 33 minutes to beat veteran Frenchman Nicolas Mahut 6-3 6-2 . The Scot coasted into a 5-0 lead in the second set before Mahut briefly rallied . In the past there have been times when the newly restored world number four has had a dip in form and motivation following his defeats in the climax of the season's opening Major, which now number four. However, there was no sign of that as he continued the purposeful approach that marked most of his campaign last month. Top seed for the event, he now faces Canada's Vasek Pospisil. 'I came to Rotterdam early to prepare properly, I want to do well here,' he said. 'I was on it from the start, I was quite sharp.' It may be significant that Murray headed to Holland last Saturday when barely over his jetlag, keen to maintain his early season momentum. One of the things he has discussed with coach Amelie Mauresmo - who is not at the event this week – is maintaining more intensity throughout the year, whatever the tournament, and this was an encouraging early sign of that. Murray stretches to reach a drop shot from the Frenchman during their match in Rotterdam . Murray plays a shot during the match against Mahut at the Ahoy Arena in Rotterdam . So was his plan to play in the doubles event, although that was aborted when his partner Gilles Muller dropped out with illness. The British number one has played this event four times previously and has not always looked delighted to be there, the notable exception being six years when he reached the final and defeated a hobbling Rafael Nadal. Yesterday was his first indoor match since getting hammered by Roger Federer at the O2 Arena back in November, a result he has already managed to banish from the memory. Mahut, a talented player on quicker surfaces, was already sharpened up by having come through the qualifying event but was swiftly put to flight by Murray, who was moving exceptionally well. He might have won the second set to love after going up 5-0, but let two games slip at the end before finishing off the Frenchman.

"A grandmother who survived a 13-storey plunge down an elevator shaft finally overcame her fears and got back in the lift for the first time in 15 years - only to get stuck. Pensioner Geraldine Tattam, now 65, her daughter and her then six-month-old granddaughter were lucky to escape with their lives when the cable snapped in the lift in a council block in Romford, north-east London, in 1999. She vowed never to use an elevator again, but three weeks ago, after returning home with heavy shopping and facing a 196-step climb, she decided to chance it. Scroll down for video . Geraldine Tattam got stuck in a lift in her council block, the first time she had used an elevator since a 13-storey plunge 15 years earlier . Ms Tattam lives on the 14th floor of the Highfield Towers council block in Romford, north-east London . To her shock, the lift dropped several feet and stopped working, leaving the unlucky grandmother trapped. Ms Tattam was stuck for more than two hours waiting for help to arrive because of a firefighters' strike. She said: 'I'm asthmatic and diabetic so I felt I had to use it. But when I was trapped I thought I was going to have a panic attack. 'I've just had enough now. It was a very scary experience.' It was the first time she had used a lift since her terrifying experience in 1999, when the emergency brakes kicked in moments before the carriage would have slammed into the ground, stopping the family just inches from almost certain death. The first lift accident saw Ms Tattam, her daughter Sarah-Jane  and her grandson Jake plummet from the 14th floor, where she lives, to the ground floor. The grandmother said: 'It was terrifying, I've never experienced anything like it before. We were all in such shock - and we got whiplash. 'I'd only been in the building about two weeks - it wasn't the best welcome.' Ms Tattam, who made a full recovery after the first incident, developed an acute fear of using the lift and climbs 14 storeys of stairs to get to her flat. the lift dropped several feet and stopped working, leaving the unlucky grandmother trapped for hours . Now Ms Tattam wants Havering Council to move her to a new building, preferably with a ground floor flat . She said: 'For a long time I avoided the lift, because the memories were too scary. 'But last month I had just had enough, and couldn't manage carrying my shopping up almost 200 stairs on my own. 'I was panicking a bit, but as soon as the doors closed there was a loud bang and the entire thing dropped. I thought I was going to die. 'But it didn't fall very far and I was able to use the emergency button to call for help. 'Still, they took their time coming to rescue me - that was the longest two hours of my life. 'I want the council to give me a ground floor flat somewhere now. I'm never using a lift again.' The retired cleaner lives in the flat with her 36-year-old son, who said the lift had been making a funny 'groaning noise' for the last couple of weeks. Havering Council, who manage the Highfield Towers building, say they will fix the lift and apologised to the shaken grandmother. Deputy council leader Damien White said: 'We are really very sorry to hear that Ms Tattam was trapped in the lift. 'A combination of factors led to a delay in responding to this incident. A technician has since reviewed the condition of the lift and it is now fully working. 'This was a very unfortunate incident and we want to reassure tenants that this doesn't happen very often.'","Geraldine Tattam survived 13-storey elevator shaft plunge 15 years ago .

"OK, chaps, put down the vacuum cleaner, step away from the kitchen sink... and head for the bedroom. Researchers claim that couples who stick to traditional gender roles in the home make love 20 times more per year. They found that on average couples have sex five times a month. But partnerships where the wife does all . the household tasks reported having sex 1.6 times more per month on . average than those where the husband does all the stereotypical female . chores. In the bedroom: Researchers claim that on average couples who stick to traditional gender roles in the home make love 20 times more per year . Previous research found husbands got more bedroom time if they helped around the home, suggesting that sex was in exchange for housework. But those studies did not factor in what types of chores the men were doing. ‘Couples in which men participate more in housework typically done by women report having sex less frequently,’ said the study’s lead author Dr Sabino Kornrich, of the Juan March Institute in Madrid. ‘Similarly, couples in which men . participate more in traditionally masculine tasks – such as DIY and car . maintenance – report higher sexual frequency. Under the covers: Couples in which men participate more in housework typically done by women report having sex less frequently . ‘Our findings suggest the importance of socialised gender roles for sexual frequency in heterosexual marriage.’ The researchers examined 4,500 heterosexual US marriages involving couples with an average age in their mid-40s. The . study by the University of Washington, published in the American . Sociological Review, suggests that adopting traditional gender roles is . important to sexual desire. ‘Our definition of attractiveness is linked to the ideal of masculinity and femininity,’ said Dr Kornrich. ‘These ideals are not necessarily the most modern and this may be a hangover of that.’ The scientists ruled out the suggestion that husbands who refused household chores might be more coercive when it came to sex. ‘Wives’ reported satisfaction with their sex life has the same relationship to men’s participation in household labour as sexual frequency,’ said Dr Kornrich. ‘Had satisfaction with sex been low, but frequency high, it might have suggested coercion. However, we didn’t find that.’ But for men hoping to leave all the work to their wives, there was a warning. ‘Men who refuse to help around the house could increase conflict in their marriage and lower their wives’ marital satisfaction,’ said Dr Kornrich. ‘Research has found that women’s marital satisfaction is indeed linked to men’s participation in overall household labour.’","Couples have sex five times a month on average, U.S. researchers found .

"The NHS is to hold an inquiry into whistleblowing over claims that a ‘culture of fear’ still stops staff exposing poor care. Sir Robert Francis, the barrister who ran the public inquiry into the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal, will chair the probe. Sir Robert said that since publishing his findings 16 months ago into the unnecessary deaths of hundreds of patients at Mid Staffs, many staff had contacted him saying they were still too scared to speak out. Investigation: Sir Robert Francis, the barrister who ran the public inquiry into the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal, will chair the probe into NHS whistleblowing . The announcement is a victory for the Mail, which has repeatedly highlighted how whistleblowers have been victimised for raising the alarm over poor standards and cover-ups. They include Dr Raj Mattu, who fought a 13-year battle to clear himself of wrongdoing, and Gary Walker, the chief executive paid £500,000 to keep quiet about the target-driven culture at United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust. Sir Robert said that although the Mid Staffordshire report had driven the NHS to be more open, many staff were still too afraid to raise concerns. ‘It’s significant to say that since the inquiry, I’ve had a lot of people talk to me about a culture of fear that prevents people from speaking out,’ he said. ‘Every time a whistleblower is treated badly, many people will be deterred from doing the right thing. That’s one of the things we’ve got to change quickly. Contact: Sir Robert said that since publishing his findings 16 months ago into the unnecessary deaths of hundreds of patients at Mid Staffs, many staff had contacted him saying they were still too scared to speak out . ‘Where those brave enough to speak out have been victimised, I’d like to look at what more could be done to remedy the wrongs which have been done.’ He has contacted whistleblowers whose cases have already come to light and will interview them on their experiences. Other NHS staff who have been victimised will be urged to get in touch through a dedicated website. Hospitals are being urged to make patients watch  airline-style safety videos under plans announced by Health  Secretary Jeremy Hunt. The two-minute films would tell people arriving on wards how to take simple precautions to avoid infections, falls, pressure sores  and dehydration. They would also encourage patients to wear bed stockings to avoid blood clots, ask staff whether they had washed their hands and tell nurses if they do not know how to take medication. The move is part of series of measures announced yesterday by Mr Hunt to make hospitals safer and encourage staff to be honest when mistakes occur. Sir Robert is hoping to publish a report in November that will set out what the Health Service needs to do to encourage staff to draw attention to poor care. The barrister, who specialises in medical negligence, spent two and a half years chairing the inquiry into failings at Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust that took place between 2005 and 2009. His report last February made 290 recommendations for the NHS and prompted key changes. Helene Donnelly, a former A&E nurse at Mid Staffordshire who now advises the Department of Health on whistleblowing, said: ‘As we speak there are staff and patients suffering. ‘We need to ensure staff feel truly able to raise concerns without fear of victimisation and that they will be listened to.’ Jennie Fecitt, a nurse who set up the group Patients First, said it had been ‘inundated’ by NHS staff who had been victimised for speaking out. She was forced out of her own job at a walk-in centre in Manchester after raising concerns about a doctor, and will be giving evidence to Sir Robert’s inquiry. She said: ‘You’re very alone when you blow the whistle. When you raise concerns about patient safety in the NHS, the organisation takes this up as an employment issue. ‘They then find a way of exiting that person. They either get removed over capability issues, on employment issues or they are just made redundant. Dr Raj Mattu: The leading cardiologist was sacked from Walsgrave Hospital in Coventry for exposing that patients were dying in overcrowded bays. Managers spent 13 years pursuing him through employment tribunals, but in April this year he was cleared of any wrongdoing and a tribunal ruled he had been unfairly dismissed. Victimised: Cardiologist Dr Raj Mattu, pictured with wife Sangita, was sacked from Walsgrave Hospital in Coventry for exposing that patients were dying in overcrowded bays . Gary Walker: He was forced out as chief executive of United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust in 2010 after warning that managers  were more obsessed with targets than patients. The trust made him sign a £500,000 gagging clause, which he broke last year. Managers are now trying to claw the money back. Forced out: Gary Walker was forced out as chief executive of United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust in 2010 after warning that managers  were more obsessed with targets than patients . Sandra Haynes Kirkbright: Mrs Haynes Kirkbright was suspended by Royal  Wolverhampton Hospitals Trust in March after accusing the trust of fiddling its death rate figures. She worked as a ‘clinical coder’ – recording patient deaths and illnesses – and claimed that staff in the same role were ‘breaking every rule in the book.’ David Ore: The security manager lost his job after exposing how staff at Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust were locking up elderly patients and children for 12 hours without food or drink. Last month police launched an investigation – one elderly man is believed to have died due to ‘unreasonable force.’ Speaking out: Sandra Haynes Kirkbright was suspended by Royal  Wolverhampton Hospitals Trust in March, while security manager David Ore lost his job at Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust .","Sir Robert Francis will chair the probe into NHS whistleblowing .

"Alan Pardew protested it was only the result that mattered in his first match against Newcastle since he quit the North-East — but the manner in which he celebrated Fraizer Campbell’s equaliser suggested it meant more to him than that. The 53-year-old was delighted after substitutes Yannick Bolasie and Campbell combined to cancel out Papiss Cisse’s first-half header. But the game was tarnished as a coin thrown from the stands hit Fabricio Coloccini, which furious Newcastle manager John Carver claimed could have blinded his defender. Palace substitute Fraizer Campbell toe-poked the ball home from close range on 71 minutes to earn the hosts a point against Newcastle .

As Newcastle players gathered in front of the Holmesdale End to revel in Cisse’s 42nd-minute goal, their captain recoiled after being hit on the forehead and referee Andre Marriner collected the missile. ‘It’s got to be taken out of the game,’ said Carver. ‘It’s a shame because they have fantastic support here. But I saw it and it missed his eye by an inch. It could have blinded him. Let’s find who it was and sort it out.’ Winger Bolasie, making his first appearance since helping DR Congo to third in the Africa Cup of Nations, transformed the game after his introduction on 68 minutes. He made a superb charge down the right and crossed for Campbell to slot past Tim Krul from six yards on 72 minutes. ‘Yannick’s cross was of the highest order,’ said Pardew, ‘I just came here and tried to get three points knowing Newcastle had some very good players. That was my only focus. It was nice to see both sets of players apply themselves in a good manner. A draw was fair.’ Papiss Cisse headed home emphatically from close range to give Newcastle the lead after Daryl Janmaat's superb cross found the striker .

Pardew’s four years on Tyneside are viewed with mixed emotions. Newcastle supporters in the Arthur Wait Stand made it evident there is no love lost. Pardew, however, was in conciliatory mode, devoting his programme notes to defending his fiery spell at St James’ Park. He made a beeline for his former players on the opposite bench before kick-off and embraced Carver. Led by the Crystal Palace Ultras, abuse from the away end was drowned out by chants of ‘Super Alan Pardew’. And the home side dominated the early stages.

"Stressed civil servants at three of Whitehall’s flagship government departments took the equivalent of more than 125 years off sick last year. Staff at the Home Office, Department for Education and Department for Communities and Local Government were absent for more than 46,000 days for stress, anxiety or depression in 2012-13. The sickness rate in parts of the civil service is four times higher than the rest of the UK workforce. At the Home Office, an average of 1.3 days were taken in 2012-13, almost three times the national average . Figures from the Office for National Statistics shows 30million workers in Britain took a total of 15.2million days off with stress, anxiety and depression last year. It means employees from all sectors took on average 0.5 days off in 2013 because of the disorders. But in Whitehall departments, hit by spending cuts and policy overhauls, the rates are much higher. Staff at the Department for Education (DfE) and the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) took an average of 1.8 days - four times the national figure. Figures released by DCLG show the number of sick days rose in the last five years, despite deep cuts to staff numbers. In 2012-13 a total of 3,052 days were taken off for mental health reasons, equivalent to nine years. The figure has risen from 2,662, or seven years, in 2008-09. Over the same period staff numbers have fallen by a quarter to 1,681. A DCLG spokesman said: ‘The civil service considers the long-term health of its staff to be of paramount importance. ‘In April 2013 the Department introduced a new comprehensive policy for managing long-term sickness absence and offers a number of wellbeing services to staff.’ Sickness rates at Theresa May's Home Office and Michael Gove's Department for Education are much higher than the national average . Staff at Michael Gove’s Department for Education took 5,156 days or 14 years off for mental health reasons in 2012-13. It reverse falls in recent years and markjs a return to levels previously seen in 2008-09. At the Home Office, an average of 1.3 days were taken in 2012-13, almost three times the national average. Staff at Theresa May’s department took 37,950 days suffering from stress, depression and anxiety in 2012-13 and 45,182 days in 2011-12. The figures cover staff working at the central Whitehall department as well as its executive agencies, such as the troubled UK Border Agency. However, the ministry said the data was ‘unreliable’ because the recording of workers' reasons for being off had not been standardised across the department and agencies.","Figures released by Home Office, Department for Education and Department for Communities .

"An angry pilot was calmed down by police after getting into an argument with an airport security official over his 'condescending' attitude. Southwest Airlines pilot John Mcghie was going through checks at Manchester-Boston Regional Airport when the row broke out with a Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) worker Bob Harbaugh. Mr Mcghie complained that he had difficulty in the past getting through the checkpoints, according to police investigating the incident. Dispute: A pilot with Southwest Airlines, pictured, got into an argument with a TSA official after complaining that he was 'condescending' He then demanded the name of the TSA official, who infuriated the pilot more by refusing to give him his details, it is claimed. The row then escalated as the Mr Harbaugh is alleged to have touched Mr Mcghie's arm, say police. Officers broke up the dispute and took statements from both men. They are now studying CCTV to see if an assault took place, as the pilot claims. Mr Mcghie is now demanding that the TSA face assault charges. Londonderry Police Lt. Tim Jones told Union Leader that an officer at the airport became aware of the two men arguing at around 10.3am last Friday. Strict: A TSA official checks a man at a U.S. airport, in scenes similar to those that angered Mr Mcghie (file picture) He added: 'The pilot felt that the supervisor was condescending and patronizing. He wanted the supervisor's name but he refused to give it. 'The argument escalated from there, but never got more physical than TSA official Bob Harbaugh touching Mcghie's arm, Jones said. 'At that point Mr. Mcghie told him not to touch him. Mr. Harbaugh became defensive and threatened to call the police.' Mr Jones said there were no witnesses to the incident but that it was loud enough for the nearby officer to be concerned about it. Mcghie is also alleged to have said he never raised his voice during the incident and told the officer that he had problems with the TSA at Manchester in the past. Mr Jones said that CCTV footage from the airport would clear up whether an assault took place. The TSA said it was aware of the dispute. They added that the police were now dealing with the investigation. Spokesman Ann Davis said: 'A preliminary review of the situation indicates that the officer followed proper screening protocol. 'We'll await the Londonderry Police Department's findings as well.' Southwest Airlines spokeswoman Christi McNeill confirmed that the airline was also conducting its own probe. Mr Mcgie was unavailable for comment.

"Senior Tory MPs plan to make an unprecedented formal complaint to Speaker John Bercow over what they see as his bias and ‘hatred’ for Conservatives. Leaders of the party’s 1922 Committee – the ‘men in grey suits’ – are expected to speak to Mr Bercow after his ‘appalling’ treatment of David Cameron this week. The Commons Speaker rebuked Mr Cameron at Prime Minister’s Question Time for describing Ed Miliband as a ‘conman’, saying the term was ‘unparliamentary’. Scroll down for video . Senior Tory MPs plan to make an unprecedented formal complaint to Speaker John Bercow (right) over his 'hatred' and 'contempt' for David Cameron . He was also seen to smirk when the Prime Minister stood to speak early by mistake. Backbenchers said he permitted ‘a wall of noise’ from Labour, while turning on a handful of Tory hecklers. Senior sources suggested that the word conman was not unparliamentary. MPs may not call each other liars, but can  say that an opponent has ‘misled’ the Commons. A small group of Tories has long criticised Mr Bercow’s approach, but it is unprecedented in modern times for senior MPs to complain formally of bias. A member of the 1922 executive said that feeling is so strong it is ‘a safe assumption’ a ‘delegation’ will call on the Speaker. One Conservative, who is generally supportive of Bercow, said: ‘It was the first time I have seen the vast majority of Tory MPs outraged. Mr Cameron was rebuked by the Speaker for calling Ed Miliband a 'conman' at Prime Minister's Question Time . ‘Bercow’s face was a face of rage. There was simply contempt in his eyes. You shouldn’t address the Prime Minister like that. ‘This was anger and dislike directed at the PM. It is clear that he hates him personally. We knew he could be biased but this went way beyond what was acceptable.’ Mr Cameron had told Mr Miliband: ‘It simply is the politics of the conman to pretend that you can freeze [energy] prices when you’re not in control of global energy prices.’ Mr Bercow broke in: ‘Let me  just say, I let it go the first time,  the word “conman” is frankly  unparliamentary. The Prime Minister is a man of great versatility in  the use of language – it’s a bit below the level.’ It is unprecedented in modern times for MPs to complain formally of bias from the Speaker in the Commons . The Speaker is no stranger to Commons controversy. Last year he attacked health minister Anna Soubry, saying she ‘thinks her views are relevant, but we are not interested’. In June, Tories accused him of failing to discipline a Labour MP who allegedly made an offensive gesture to Chancellor George Osborne. Earlier this week, he stopped Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt from talking about Labour’s NHS record. Mr Bercow’s spokesman said: 'If Members have any concerns and raise them with Mr Speaker, he will respond appropriately.'","Leaders of the Conservatives 1922 Committee expected to speak to John Bercow after his 'appalling' treatment of David Cameron .

"Accrington Stanley have highlighted the class divide in English football between the fourth tier and top flight with a cheeky Twitter post on Premier League's record-smashing £5billion TV rights deal. The self-described 'club that wouldn't die' say that one match in the new deal, worth an average of about £10million would cover their most significant outgoings - player wages - for two decades. As Sky Sports and BT Sport poured a combined £5.136bn into the 168 games that will be shown live between 2016 and 2019, and the headline clubs contemplated what they'd do with their riches, Stanley's social media mouthpiece put things into perspective. 'The Prem Lge has a new £5bn TV deal. £10m per match. 1 game would pay our annual wage bill for the next 20 years,' ASFC posted on Twitter on Wednesday afternoon. Seamus McCarten shoots for Accrington Stanley, whose wage bill could be paid for 20 years with what broadcasters have paid the Premier League for the TV rights to a single match in the new £5bn deal . Stanley take the pitch for a match against Darlington at their 5,057-capacity (2,000 seated) Crown Ground . A cameraman takes in the view of Manchester City's empty 47,405-capactiy (all seated) Etihad Stadium . Sky Sports took up five of the  seven packages on offer for the three seasons from 2016-17, while the other two went to BT Sport as the deal marked a 70 per cent boost on the current deal for the Premier League, already the world's richest football competition. While League Two's 15th-placed club didn't go into exact details of their costings, the more the numbers are crunched on the staggering deal the more clubs down the pecking order's proverbial jaws will drop. BT Sport are forking out £7.6m a game for their packages of Saturday afternoon games and midweek matches, but Sky are paying a whopping £11.1m-a-match for their five sets that include a first for Friday nights, Saturday lunchtimes, two slots on Sunday, Monday evening, and Bank Holidays. If CIty claim top spot in 2016-17, as they did last season, they will get around £156m from TV rights alone . Of course, comparisons between Accrington Stanley and world famous Liverpool gave the club international recognition in the 1980s in an advertisement for the Milk Marketing Board. When one kid was disgusted by his friend having a glass of milk, he says: It's what Ian Rush drinks... He said if I didn't drink lots of milk, when I grow up, I'll only be good enough to play for Accrington Stanley.' The milk hater said: 'Accrington Stanley, who are they?' 'Exactly,' was the famous response that has now become a catch phrase. Ian Rush appears at Accrington Stanley with a milk bottle referencing the famous 1980s commercial mocking the club in his role promoting telecommunications company EE . As with the milk ad, Accrington see none of the Premier League deal that works out at £1,887 per second of action shown. Of course, the clubs don't see all of this money, but they do get the lion's share with the bottom club in the 2016-17 season when the new deal begins expecting £99million from the TV rights, up from £62m this season and £1.5m more than this year's top club will get. The top club, and the Crown Ground faithful may want to look away now, will get around £156m for the 2016-17 campaign up from £97.5m this time around. With Premier League clubs concentrating on building their brands internationally and working out how to best monetise already packed stadiums, Accrington Stanley just want their turnstiles at the Crown - with a capacity of 5,057 with 2,000 seated - to be troubled. @ASFC boasts 20,200 followers which it's pointed out would fill the Crown Ground more than four times over: 'Be lovely if even 10% of you could make it to a game 1 day.' @ASFC pointed out that their 20,200 Twitter followers could fill their home ground four times over . Cricket legend David Lloyd is a famous Accrington Stanley fan and among many fan shareholders . The club also shows what the simple purchase of a scarf would do for its young players. 'Selling 15 of these pays 1 of our young professionals for a week,' the club posted on Wednesday with a link to its red and white merchandise. 'We may not be in Prem. We may not be on TV. We may not be glamorous. But we care about every share & shareholder #stanleyfamily,' says the account, directing followers to invest in their £100 share packages that earn them a vote at the club AGM and the honour of joining the ranks of Sir Alex Ferguson and famous fan David Lloyd.

"His list of ‘likes’ covers a broad range of interests – from sunshine to dancing, good food to fitness. Nowhere, however, does Clinton Baugh admit to a penchant for sleazy late-night clinches with the wives of prominent politicians. The DJ and professional dancer was yesterday revealed as the man that Sally  Bercow was pictured kissing at a West End nightclub last Saturday. Named: The man who kissed Speaker's wife Sally Bercow is believed to be DJ and fitness fanatic Craig Oliver, 49 . And perhaps worryingly for her . husband, Commons Speaker John Bercow, Mr Baugh is also on the lookout . for ‘the love of a good woman’. Mother . of three Mrs Bercow, 44, has insisted she is just friends with the . muscle-bound 49-year-old, who also uses the name Clinton Oliver. The Sun frontpage: Mrs Bercow, 44, was seen in an intimate clinch with the unidentified 'friend', now named as a London fitness trainer . Mr . Baugh, who also works as a personal trainer and dance instructor, . describes ‘beautiful girls’ and ‘female fitness models’ as two of his . likes on his Facebook page, where he has posted pictures of athletes . posing seductively in skimpy bikinis. In a separate profile, he describes  himself as a classically trained professional dancer with more than ten years’ experience. He . adds: ‘I like warm sunny days, great music, good food, and the love of a . good woman. I understand the need to dance and the need to dance to . good music. ‘This has helped me greatly in moving the dancefloor for over 10 years now … Here I am, come and get me.’ The . astonishing pictures of Mrs Bercow and Mr Baugh kissing  at London’s . No5 Cavendish Square nightclub last weekend were first published in the . Sun on Tuesday. The . Speaker’s wife was pictured in a brown wig at the party, which was . hosted by Calum Best – son of late Manchester United  footballer George . Best – and  The Only Way is Essex star  Chloe Sims. One . clubber who witnessed the clinch told the Sun: ‘They were snogging with . tongues and couldn’t take their hands off each other. It lasted for at . least two minutes. I wonder if he knew he was kissing the Speaker’s . wife? ‘You could tell Sally . was drunk. She appeared unsteady on her feet and her top was stained – . so she had obviously had a fair bit to drink. Ms Bercow attempted to play the photographs down on her Twitter account after they emerged . She said the images of her kissing the unknown man had been incorrectly interpreted by the media . Ms Bercow took to the social network to deny her marriage was in trouble after she kissed another man . Description: Mr Oliver, 49, says online that he is a man who likes to 'live, love and dance' ‘It . was very intimate. She didn’t seem to care who was watching her. Perhaps she thought the wig would disguise her. It is humiliating for . her husband. I am sure he’ll be upset and appalled.’ Such . was the potential embarrassment for Mrs Bercow’s husband, that copies . of the Sun were diplomatically removed from the Commons tea room by the . time MPs arrived at work on the morning of publication. But one MP later placed a photocopy of the front page – headlined ‘Out of Order! Order!’ – on each of the tables. Meanwhile, . Mrs Bercow launched an extraordinary defence of her behaviour. She . said: ‘Of course I’m still together [with John], I don’t need to . apologise to John, I’ve done nothing wrong. ‘My marriage is my business. I couldn’t give a damn what  people think. Let people judge me if they want. ‘I’m still very much with John, I’m sitting here in the flat with John and I did nothing wrong. ‘I went out for a friend’s birthday party. I love my husband, he is the most important man in my life.’ She told the London Evening Standard: ‘The guy in the picture is a friend. End of. ‘I . can’t wait until John  finishes being Speaker, maybe then the media . will leave me alone. No marriage is perfect but ours works for us.’ She . also took to Twitter to claim The Sun took the photographs ‘completely . out of context’, and she accused the newspaper of ‘shoddy journalism’ by . failing to contact her before publication. The Sun said it had repeatedly tried to contact her through her husband’s Westminster office. With the identity of her ‘friend’ still a mystery, the following day more details of Mrs Bercow’s night out emerged. Compromising photo: The picture surfaced on the Guido Fawkes blog, showing Sally Bercow straddling a pub sofa and holding a champagne flute . Denial: Mrs Bercow claimed the images of her kissing a man in a nightclub are 'totally misleading'. The Labour party activist has regularly courted publicity in recent years, including appearing in Celebrity Big Brother 2011 . Aisha Laine, who was also at the club, said that the kissing was so passionate she assumed they were a couple. She told the newspaper: ‘I’d no idea who she was until afterwards. I thought she must be in a relationship with the guy. Outraged: Mrs Bercow claimed the images are 'totally misleading' and denied her marriage was in trouble . ‘Someone told me it was Sally out of Big Brother but I didn’t recognise her. She looked a mess. ‘I . was shocked when I saw The Sun picture and read she was married. You . don’t expect someone in her position to carry on like that.’ Ms Laine said when she tried to dance with Mr Baugh, Mrs Bercow’s friends made it clear he was  off limits. The . newspaper appealed to its readers to help them find the mystery . smoocher. And yesterday they succeeded as they were able to unmask Mr . Baugh. Mrs Bercow and Mr Baugh are not believed to have planned to meet at the club, and bumped into each other by chance. A friend of Mr Baugh told the Sun: ‘He’s a lovely bloke, although Sally is not the type of girl he would normally go for. ‘He’s . a great guy, really into his fitness and isn’t a drinker as far  as I . know.’ If the kissing picture wasn’t embarrassing enough, a  second . photograph from her night out showed her being grasped around the waist . as she straddled the arm of a sofa while holding a champagne flute. Mrs . Bercow has claimed she only started drinking again in 2012 after a . decade off alcohol and that, while she likes a few drinks, she is ‘very . strict’ about how much. Marriage: The mother-of-three (right) has been married to current Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow (left) for 11 years. She is believed to have been wearing her diamond wedding ring during the kiss . Celebrity haunt: previous guests at the nightclub where Mrs Bercow partied have included Helen Flanagan . ‘I . only started to drink again last year after ten years off it. I  drank . every day, sometimes up to two bottles of wine, and I was out  of . control. ‘I don’t drink every day but I know I’m an addictive person so I have to watch it.’ Mr Baugh, who lives in a £600,000 terrace house in Battersea, South West London, did not respond to requests to comment. Sally Bercow has courted controversy since her husband was elected Speaker – despite insisting she hates publicity. Months after John Bercow started his high-profile Commons role in 2009, she gave a remarkable interview describing her previous ‘ladette’ behaviour of heavy drinking and casual sex. She said: ‘I would end up sometimes at a bar and someone would send a drink over, and I’d think, “Why not?” and we’d go home together.’ Her role as the Speaker’s wife was also drawn into question after she posed in nothing but a bedsheet against the backdrop of the Houses of Parliament for a magazine photoshoot in 2011.During her time on 2011’s Celebrity Big Brother she also forged an unlikely friendship with My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding star Paddy Doherty. She later took the Irish traveller and his wife on a tour  of Parliament and Mr Bercow later joined them for a  double date. Last year, she was forced to pay £15,000 damages to the late Tory grandee Lord McAlpine after wrongly linking him to child abuse allegations on Twitter. The following month it emerged that she had been selling antiques on eBay from her free home in Parliament. The furniture was her own, but photographs of it were clearly taken in the grace-and-favour apartments provided for her husband. In October, she put on an unexpected show for paparazzi when she danced in the street as she emerged from a party. Flashing her knickers as she clambered into a taxi, she grabbed a friend’s leg, provocatively placed it over her own and made a rude gesture with her middle finger.","Bercow had been spotted kissing a mystery man in a West End night club .

"British cricket helmet manufacturer Masuri have designed a clip-on application to provide extra protection for batsmen in a bid to prevent a repeat of the tragic death of Australian Phillip Hughes last year. Hughes, 25, was killed last November when a bouncer from fast bowler Sean Abbott struck him on the neck, dissecting his vertebral artery and causing a brain haemorrhage. Masuri’s new product is designed to protect the vulnerable area from such impacts. A clip-on application has been added to cricket helmets to provide extra protection for batsmen . Phillip Hughes was killed when a bouncer from fast bowler Sean Abbott struck him on the neck . The bouncer dissected Hughes' vertebral artery and caused a brain haemorrhage . The ‘StemGuard’, a device made from plastic and dense foam, will clip on to the back of existing Masuri Vision helmets. The foam – which is military specification – is similar to that between the layers of a helmet shell, and is the key component in reducing the impact of high-speed deliveries directed at the neck. The idea behind the arrangement of the foam and plastic – in a honeycomb shape – is to afford the batsman manoeuvrability while still providing as much protection as the shell of the helmet. The ‘StemGuard’ is designed to offer batsman manoeuvrability and protection . The ‘StemGuard’ is made from high-strength plastic and dense foam . Hampshire-based Masuri - whose helmets were worn by England players Moeen Ali, Gary Ballance, Eoin Morgan, Ravi Bopara, Jos Buttler, Chris Jordan, Stuart Broad and James Tredwell against Pakistan yesterday – tested the StemGuard at Loughborough University using the same ball-firing equipment and measuring apparatus used to test helmet peaks. Former professionals and the cricket boards of England, India and Australia have also been involved with the design, consultation and testing process. The StemGuard is patent pending, meaning the UK Patent Office have accepted there is no similar product on the market, and Masuri can go ahead with manufacturing and selling it .","Phillip Hughes was killed last November when a bouncer from fast bowler Sean Abbott struck him on the neck .

"Concerns: Home Secretary Theresa May. She said the conflicts in Syria and Iraq had created a haven for terrorists just a few hours from London by plane . The security services need new surveillance powers to counter the ‘real and deadly’ threat from jihadists, Theresa May warned last night in a fresh call for a so-called ‘snooper’s charter’. The Home Secretary said the conflicts in Syria and Iraq had created a haven for terrorists just a few hours from London by plane. At the same time, the internet has become a ‘paradise’ for terrorists and criminals who can operate out of the reach of the authorities. Mrs May warned that Britain faced threats from Islamist groups around the world, hostile nations, cyber hacking and international organised crime. In a speech in London, she revealed she had approved interception operations to fight the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological technology. But she added that the powers used to defeat Britain’s enemies were not keeping up with new technology, leading to a collapse in Britain’s capacity to protect its citizens. This ‘loss of capability’ is the ‘great danger we face’ Mrs May said. ‘We no longer have the capabilities upon which we have always relied.’ Mrs May’s call last year for a law to allow the collection of vast amounts of information about emails, phone calls and internet activities was blocked by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. But her speech yesterday will be seen by critics as an attempt to resurrect her ‘snooper’s charter’. She dismissed accusations that the Government was engaged in mass surveillance, as claimed by supporters of rogue US spy Edward Snowden. In fact, far from having a ‘fictitious mastery’ of the technology, Britain faced the ‘significant risk of being caught out by it’. She added: ‘The real problem is not that we have built an over-mighty state but that the state is finding it harder to fulfil its most basic duty – to protect the public. ‘The terrorist threats to this country and our interests are changing faster than at any time since 9/11. ‘We continue to face possible attacks by Al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan. But we face further threats from Syria and now from Iraq where Al Qaeda, ISIL [ISIS] and others have created a haven with substantial resources, including advanced technology and weapons. 'They are on the doorstep of Europe, just a few hours flying time from London, and they want to attack us – not just in Syria or Iraq but here in Britain.’ Snoops: Aerial view of the Government Communication Headquarters (GCHQ). Mrs May revealed she had approved interception operations to fight the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological technology . Some of the Britons who went to fight in the Middle East would pose a ‘real danger’ when they returned, she said, revealing for the first time that a few of the estimated 400 British citizens who had travelled to join the jihadists were women. She added: ‘The world is a dangerous place and the United Kingdom needs the capabilities to defend its interests and protect its citizens. ‘We are in danger of making the internet an ungoverned, ungovernable space, a haven for terrorism and criminality.’ Britain is at greater risk because its ‘secret capabilities’ were exposed by Snowden, she said, and the public was in danger of being misled about state surveillance as a result of claims made from documents he stole and published. She added: ‘There is no programme of mass surveillance and there is no surveillance state.’","Home Secretary said security services need new surveillance powers .

"Taking a walk through the Lake District early this month you could have been forgiven for thinking you had spotted a musical legend frozen in time. For, as the snow fell and the ice took grip of Red Tarn lake, the outline of a face emerged from the icy waters. Photographer Daz Slater captured this image of the expanse of water, one of the highest in the Lakes, lying at an altitude of 2,356 feet. In it, he saw the image of Reggae legend Bob Marley. Frozen in time: Photographer Daz Slater captured this image resembling the face of reggae legend Bob Marley standing out from the frozen waters of Red Tarn lake in the Lake District . Iconic: The figurehead is shaped like one of the beanie hats often worn by the  singer-songwriter, who started his career as the frontman for The Wailers . Highest: Red Tarn lies at 2,356 feet above sea level, making it one of the highest in the Lake District . The way the snow has fallen on the shoreline and the pattern of the ice in the waters, show the outline of the lake resembles a man's head. And the figurehead appears as though it could be wearing one of the colourful beanie hats, often worn by the Jamaican singer-songwriter, who started his career as the frontman for The Wailers. Marley, known for a string of hits including No Woman, No Cry and I Shot The Sheriff, died of cancer in May 1981 at the Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Miami. But for those fans hoping to catch a glimpse of the star's face in the waters of Red Tarn, might be disappointed. For once the icy and snow has thawed, the outline of the lake takes on a more rugged and random appearance. Legend: The Jamaican singer-songwriter, once frontman of the group The Wailers, is known for hits including No Woman, No Cry and I Shot The Sheriff . Singer-songwriter: Bob Marley passed away in a Miami hospital in May 1981 after battling cancer . The Tarn has a depth of 82 feet, and the lake's head wall rises 1,000 feet to the summit of Helvellyn. It is enclosed by the forbiding Striding Edge and Swirral Edge. The lake was formed when the glacier that carved out the eastern side of Helvellyn melted. It is fed by a number of streams running down its rear wall down into the corrie and it flows outward into Glenridding Beck. In the nineteenth century Red Tarn was dammed, using boulders, which raised the water level some eight or nine feet in order to supply power to the Greenside Lead Mine at Glenridding.","Photographer Daz Slater captured this image in the Lakes early this month .

"Lung cancer can remain dormant for 20 years before it is triggered into an aggressive form of the disease, a new study has warned. The first genetic mutations which cause the cancer could go undetected for up to two decades before additional faults trigger cancer cells to grow rapidly. During this expansion there is a surge of different genetic faults appearing in separate areas of the tumour. Lung cancer can remain dormant for 20 years as the first genetic mutations can be missed. New additional genetic faults - usually caused by smoking - trigger cancer cells to grow rapidly . Each distinct section evolves down different paths - meaning that every part of the tumour is genetically unique. Researchers hope the new discovery will lead to earlier detection. Two-thirds of patients are diagnosed with advanced forms of lung cancer, when treatments are less likely to be successful. Over 40,000 people are diagnosed with the disease each year, but fewer than a tenth survive for at least five years after being diagnosed. Professor Charles Swanton, at Cancer Research UK's London Research Institute and the UCL Cancer Institute, said: 'Survival from lung cancer remains devastatingly low with many new targeted treatments making a limited impact on the disease. 'By understanding how it develops we've opened up the disease's evolutionary rule book in the hope that we can start to predict its next steps.' The study examined lung cancers from seven patients - including smokers, ex-smokers and never smokers. The findings also highlighted the role of smoking in the development of lung cancer. Many of the early genetic faults are caused by smoking. But as the disease evolved these became less important with the majority of faults now caused by a new process generating mutations within the tumour controlled by a protein called APOBEC. The wide variety of faults found within lung cancers explains why targeted treatments have had limited success. Attacking a particular genetic mistake identified by a biopsy in lung cancer will only be effective against those parts of the tumour with that fault, leaving other areas to thrive and take over. Over 40,000 people are diagnosed with the disease each year, but fewer than a tenth survive for at least five years after being diagnosed . Professor Nic Jones, Cancer Research UK's chief scientist, said: 'This fascinating research highlights the need to find better ways to detect lung cancer earlier when it's still following just one evolutionary path. 'If we can nip the disease in the bud and treat it before it has started travelling down different evolutionary routes we could make a real difference in helping more people survive the disease. 'Building on this work Cancer Research UK is funding a study called TRACERx which is studying 100s of patient's lung cancers as they evolve over time to find out exactly how lung cancers mutate, adapt and become resistant to treatments ' Dr Noel Snell, Director of Research at the British Lung Foundation, said: 'Late presentation and diagnosis are key reasons for the very poor survival rates from this disease, which are worse in the UK than in Europe and the US. 'Finding the cancers earlier means that they are more liked to be curable; this exciting new research suggests that if they could be diagnosed at a very early stage in their evolution we might be able to tackle the disease earlier and dramatically improve survival rates. 'Greater investment in this sort of research is absolutely vital if we are to make significant advances in the management of this terrible condition.' The study was published in the journal Science.","First genetic mutations of the cancer could go undetected for 20 years .

"Tiger Woods has announced he will take a break from golf as he bids to overcome his latest injury scare and poor form. The 14-time major champion withdrew midway through his first round at last week's Farmers Insurance Open in California due to back pain although he has allayed fears over the setback. Of more pressing concern for the 39-year-old is his recent struggles on the course, with his injury coming six days after recording the worst round of his career - an 11-over-par 82 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open. Tiger Woods is taking a break from competition golf to work on his game and regain full fitness . 'Right now, I need a lot of work on my game, and to still spend time with the people that are important to me,' Woods wrote in a statement on his official website. 'My play, and scores, are not acceptable for tournament golf. Like I've said, I enter a tournament to compete at the highest level, and when I think I'm ready, I'll be back.' Although his comments read as if Woods is taking an indefinite break from the sport, he's also said that he hopes to play his hometown Honda Classic, which begins in a fortnight on February 26 at Palm Beach Gardens in Florida. Woods pulled out midway through his first round at last week's Farmers Insurance Open in California . 'Next week I will practice at Medalist and at home getting ready for the rest of the year. I am committed to getting back to the pinnacle of my game,' he said. The 14-time major winner said he is 'committed to getting back to the pinnacle of my game' 'I'd like to play The Honda Classic - it's a tournament in my hometown and it's important to me - but I won't be there unless my game is tournament-ready. That's not fair to anyone. 'I do, however, expect to be playing again very soon.' The American withdrew from last year's event in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, after 13 holes with back pain and would eventually have to undergo surgery in April on a pinched nerve which forced him to miss the Masters and the US Open. Yet any thoughts that he has aggravated the problem were dismissed. 'The last two weeks have been very disappointing to me, especially Torrey, because I never want to withdraw. Unfortunately, lately injuries have made that happen too often,' he said. 'This latest injury is not related to my previous surgery. I am having daily physical therapy and I am feeling better every day.' Since his return from last year's injury, Woods has struggled to recapture the form that saw him become one of the greatest players of all-time. He finished 69th at the Open at Royal Liverpool in July, while a month later he missed just his fourth cut in 66 majors as a professional after suffering yet more back trouble at the US PGA Championship at Valhalla. Woods subsequently ruled himself out of consideration for a captain's pick for the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles in September because of injury and later revealed he did not feel he could have won a point for the United States. Woods speaks to media following his withdrawal in Arizona. He has since said he's targeting a return to the game at his hometown Honda Classic, but that 'I won't be there unless my game is tournament-ready' Woods made an underwhelming return to golf by shooting a five-over-par first round at the Hero World Challenge in December and it has gone from bad to worse in his first two tournaments of 2015. His withdrawal on Thursday was the ninth of his career to date, and the third in his last eight. He has not won a PGA Tour event since 2013 and has failed to land a major since 2008.

"Samsung last night unveiled its latest flagship device, the Galaxy S3, the follow-up to last year's best-selling phone in the world. The smartphone market moves on once more, with the hi-tech voice-controlled Galaxy S3 likely to becomes a standard-bearer for Google’s Android operating system - and a device for the Apple refuseniks. The phone’s most innovative feature is built-in face-tracking and voice control - allowing, Samsung claims, for a more 'natural' control system. Other innovations include what Samsung claims is a 'more intelligent' lock system, that keeps the screen 'awake' when the phone’s camera senses eyes watching it, rather than turning it off. Blue and white: The Samsung S3 launches at the end of May, available in 'pebble blue' and 'marble white' The voice control system is called S Voice - and allows access to weather forecasts, web searches and scheduling, similar to iPhone’s Siri system. Saying 'I want to take a picture' launches the camera application - and will work in eight languages at launch. S Voice can also reply out loud - which Samsung claims will allow the system to be used while driving. Available in blue and white, the phone will be launched at the end of May, starting in Europe, with other regions following. Samsung played on its expertise in screens with a large 4.8-inch Super AMOLED screen running a resolution of 1280 x 720p - far bigger than Apple’s iPhone, and close in size to the smaller end of the tablet market. Ready for launch: A still from Samsung's presentation reveals the S3 for the first time . Screen size:4.8 inch . Processor:1.4 Ghz quad-core . Memory size:Up to 32gb (+64gb with card) Operating system:Android Ice Cream Sandwich . Camera:Eight megapixel . Weight: . 133grams . Dimensions:Height - 136mmWidth - 70mmDepth - 8.5mm . Battery:2100mAh . Screen size:4.7 inch . Processor:1.5Ghz quad-core . Memory size:32GB (non-expandable) Operating system:Android Ice Cream Sandwich . Camera:Eight megapixel . Weight:130grams . Dimensions:Height - 134mmWidth - 69mmDepth - 8.9mm . Battery:1800mAh . Screen size:3.5 inch . Processor:800 MHz dual-core . Memory size:Up to 64gb (non-expandable) Operating system:iOS . Camera:Eight megapixel . Weight:140grams . Dimensions:Height - 115mmWidth - 58mmDepth - 9mm . Battery:1432mAh . The S3 is powered by a quad-core processor - similar to the ones found in many laptops, and far more powerful than the dual core found in the iPhone. The phone also includes an NFC chip - near-field-communications - allowing users to share content such as video by tapping phones together. And if you are sick of wires, a separate wireless charging kit means you can charge your phone without hooking it up to the socket. Live audience: Hundreds of people packed into the Earls Court auditorium to see the launch of the phone . Mail Online science editor Rob Waugh gets hands-on with the S3: . The screen isn’t quite the match of some Android rivals such as Sony’s new Xperia S, but on every other count, this is a uniquely desirable device - and likely to set the pace for Apple’s next iPhone. The speed of the quad-core processor is detectable in every app, with the new version of Android giving everything a satisfyingly sci-fi 'Tron'-like feel, and the screen is absolutely huge - with the extra space particularly useful when panning through photos with a fingertip. It is also not massively bigger than its predecessor the S2, despite the vast screen - although anyone switching from an iPhone will definitely notice the difference. This blurs the line between phones and tablets - and pulls off the feat with verve. It's also packed with hidden treats - tapping two phones to trade videos between them at 300mbps is probably no more than a novelty, but it's a good one. Burst shoot outperforms a lot of dedicated digital cameras, with a held-down finger rattling out a machine-gun sequence of 20 pictures per second, then instantly picking the best using face detection. The auto-call function’s another 'why hasn’t anyone done this' winner - if you’re looking at a text, for instance, then pick up the phone and put it to your face, it automatically calls the person who texted you. It's smart - and it works. Voice control, as ever, is a bit more take-it-or-leave-it - although it’s unfair to judge S Voice from a crowded and noisy convention centre. It did at least bring up a weather forecast - but trying to persuade it to take a photo was far more difficult. Overall, this is a gorgeous handset that’s likely to put more momentum behind Google’s Android. Samsung has raised the stakes here - and Apple will have to do something truly special to beat this. Samsung pointed out that while the . screen is 22 per cent larger than the previous S2, the 'bezel' around it . has been slimmed down, so that the gadget is barely bigger than its . predecessor. The gadget will launch on May 29 in Europe, and in 10 other . cities worldwide including Tokyo and Dubai. The gadget also has some features clearly aimed at the . business market once dominated by BlackBerry. On-device encryption will allow secure emails working within . business networks - catering for the new trend for businesses allowing . employees to 'bring their own' smartphones rather than using company phones. The NFC chip will also be used for tap-to-pay mobile . payments, in partnership with Visa, with a 'virtual wallet' on the device . making payment simple. The . phone is also armed with a battery claimed to last longer than other . devices  - despite a form factor which is 8.6mm thin and 130g in weight. The phone has an eight megapixel camera - on a par with both iPhone 4S and the previous Galaxy S2. The . device was presented by Samsung president JK Shin, who said: 'There were a lot of . rumours and speculation - some were right, and some were wrong. 'The . Galaxy S3 is the best-in-class smartphone in the world.' The . phone was shown off by The Gadget Show’s Suzi Perry at a high-profile . event at London's Earls Court exhibition centre - a large, clearly . expensive stage show that had a distinct resemblance to Apple’s . well-choreographed showings for new iPhones and iPads. 'This is the biggest launch event of the year,' said Perry. Samsung is also to launch a range of pop-up shops which will show off the handset around Europe - announcing this in a way reminiscent of Steve Job's traditional, 'One last thing,' at their product launches. A new feature called ‘Pop up Play’ enables multitasking - so that you can, for instance, put a video in a . window on screen, then use other apps with the rest of the screen. This sort of feature was previously the province of Windows or Mac machines, rather than phones. Competition: The iPhone 4S and HTC One series are also premium models with high brand loyalty . The camera can also burst-shoot at speeds of up to 20 frames per second - faster than many pro-grade cameras. The camera also automatically zooms in on faces by double-tapping the screen and a ‘best-shot’ mode auto-selects the best out of the burst. Some of the apps pre-installed on the S3 . The phone’s front camera can also shoot in HD - still rare in smartphones - and take still images at the same time. Sharing photos with friends is also . speeded up by face-recognition technology - which offers to 'share' photos with any friends detected in a photo using hi-tech face . recognition, sharing either by text message or email, with a bubble . popping up over each person's face with the option to send the photo to . them. The S2 is expected to cost around £35-£40 per . month. Carphone Warehouse said their tariffs would start for £36 on a . 24-month contract. The S3 also contains voice controls - . which brings it up to speed with the iPhone's Siri - but users may be . wondering if it will be another damp squib. Despite . the fun of Apple's Siri, most users prefer traditional controls over . speaking to their phone, and the feature which launched the iPhone 4s is . not used by many users. The Samsung Galaxy S3 will be heavily promoted with a worldwide advertising campaign starting this week. Samsung is now the biggest phone . manufacturer in the world, and for this launch they took a page out of . Apple's marketing guide and kept everything hush-hush. Even . Samsung's invite to journalists and enthusiasts for the launch in Earl's Court, London, played it quiet - simply inviting people to . 'come and meet the next Galaxy'. The stylus-equipped Galaxy Note was a hit for Samsung, proving there is a market for devices with five-inch screens .","Samsung unveiled latest flagship smartphone at Apple-style launch party in London .

"Fit-again Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge is confident he can forge a successful partnership with Mario Balotelli as the club look to secure Champions League football next season. Sturridge made his first Premier League start since August in Liverpool's 3-2 win against top-four rivals Tottenham on Tuesday night, but it was former Manchester City striker Balotelli that stole the headlines. The 24-year-old Italy striker came off the bench, replacing Sturridge, and scored the winner for Brendan Rodgers' side - his first Premier League strike since joining the Anfield club last summer from AC Milan. Daniel Sturridge made his first Premier League start since August in the 3-2 win against Tottenham . Sturridge (centre) wins a penalty after he was adjudged to have been brought down by Danny Rose . Mario Balotelli replaced Sturridge in the second half of the clash at Anfield . Balotelli's best game for Liverpool came alongside Sturridge at White Hart Lane on his debut last August and the 25-year-old believes they can combine as a pair going forward. Sturridge said: 'He's been waiting for a while to break his duck and been working very hard in training, and now he has scored one in the league I am sure things will start to go his way now. 'For me it's always about trying to help players who are here, not just Mario, but all the boys who are at the club. It's not easy to settle into a new team, a new area, a new lifestyle, with different people around you and so on and so forth. 'People don't ever take that into account. I just try to do my bit, although I'm not taking any credit for him scoring – I'm just happy he did.' Balotelli had only been on the pitch a short while when he scored the winning goal . Balotelli celebrates with Adam Lallana after scoring the winning goal for Liverpool . Sturridge added: 'Whatever team the manager chooses to put out I will do my best whoever I have a partnership with. I try to adapt to whoever I am playing with and bring out the best in each other, and we (me and Mario) click when we are playing together.' 'But it is not just about me trying to do what I do - in the Tottenham game (in August) I played a little bit differently to how I did on Tuesday. 'I know Philippe Coutinho likes to thread balls through so I had to play on the shoulder a bit more. 'With Mario I can move around and go into wide areas because I know he will occupy the centre-halves. 'You play differently with different players and I am sure we will strike up a partnership in the future, I have no doubts about that.","Daniel Sturridge made his first start since August against Tottenham .

"Designers from Dolce & Gabbana to Ghost have sent dresses reminiscent of nightwear down the catwalk, and some stars have even worn nighties out on the town. So was Loose Women presenter Andrea McLean, 45, able to tell dress from nightie? 1. This must be a dress — it has lining, a zip and smoothed over all my lumps and bumps.

"Confidence is running high in the England camp and Chris Robshaw believes his side have developed the composure to lose their ‘nearly men’ tag and finally challenge for the elusive Grand Slam. England have finished second in every RBS 6 Nations since Stuart Lancaster took over in 2012, but the Red Rose side are now the bookies’ favourites to win the championship after their opening-round victory over Wales. Robshaw’s side trailed 10-0 after just eight minutes at the Millennium Stadium, but the 28-year-old skipper believes previous heartbreaks ensured there was no panic in the face of adversity — contrasting Friday’s performance to the 30-3 defeat in 2013.

The good thing was that no-one went off script. It was still reasonably early in the game and the guys stuck to doing their jobs. ‘We had a great win, but it’s a start to the campaign for us and that’s all. It’s about how we back it up because we’ve had some great wins in this tournament but unfortunately we haven’t picked anything up. We’ve got a triple crown, but the big prize at the end has eluded us three times.

"Ireland are set to roar against France on Saturday with Joe Schmidt poised to recall three Test Lions to his starting line-up and add a fourth to the bench when he names his team on Thursday. The Ireland head coach will recall Johnny Sexton, Sean O’Brien and Jamie Heaslip to the starting XV, while Cian Healy will be among the replacements. However, it appeared Schmidt was willing to wait on a Wednesday night medical update (and this morning’s training session) before making a final call on whether to include yet another 2013 Lion in Ulster’s Rory Best. Jonathan Sexton is expected to return against France after a three-month absence with concussion . Sean O'Brien is another British and Irish Lions player set to start against the French . Having comfortably seen off Italy in Rome, the Kiwi will be confident the inclusions of Sexton, Heaslip and O’Brien from the start — with Healy as a replacement — can give a timely boost to Ireland’s Six Nations title defence. This Saturday will be Sexton’s first match of any kind since Ireland beat Australia 12 weeks ago, the out-half getting stood down in the interim by a French neurologist and ordered to rest following repeated concussion. He will replace Ian Keatley, his Roman deputy, who slips out of the squad as Ian Madigan’s greater versatility across the back line means he will again provide this weekend’s No 10 bench cover. Heaslip, who had been nursing a shoulder problem since the start of January, was left out for the game in Rome despite being declared fit in the latter part of last week. Cian Healy is set to be named among the replacements when Joe Schmidt names team on Thursday . Jamie Heaslip is another Lions player to be recalled for Ireland's game with France on Saturday . But he will now return to his familiar No 8 role at the expense of Jordi Murphy after missing his first Six Nations match since 2011. The inclusion of Sexton and Heaslip in today’s 2pm team announcement at Carton House will be no surprise, but Schmidt is willing to give O’Brien a second chance to play his first Test since November 2013 following last Saturday’s aborted comeback in Italy. O’Brien, who twice had shoulder reconstruction surgery in 2014, had been chosen to start at Stadio Olimpico but pulled up lame in the pre-match warm-up with a tight hamstring, an 11th-hour development that resulted in Schmidt hurriedly promoting replacement Tommy O’Donnell to the starting line-up. Rory Best (centre) was taken off during the 26-3 victory over Italy with concussion on Saturday afternoon . Like his Munster team-mate Keatley, O’Donnell has dropped from the starting XV in Rome out of the matchday squad entirely. Healy, who trained fully on February 3 for the first time in 17 weeks following hamstring surgery, is poised to feature in his first Test since the title win in Paris last March — the loosehead taking over from James Cronin in the replacements. And he may yet be joined on the bench by Best. The Ulster hooker has not trained fully since suffering a concussion in Rome last Saturday and must prove his readiness if he is to keep back-up Sean Cronin out of the No 2 shirt. The Ireland players celebrate a try during the opening Six Nations fixture win in Italy last weekend . Meanwhile, France have made just one change from the side that laboured to a dull opening-round victory over Scotland last Saturday. Head coach Philippe Saint-Andre has replaced injured loosehead Alexandre Menini with Eddy Ben Arous, Sexton’s Top 14 team-mate at Racing Metro. Vincent Debaty comes onto the bench, where he will likely be used as a late impact substitute.","Ireland play France in second round of Six Nations matches on Saturday .

"There was no mistaking who ruled the waves today, as the world's largest container ship pulled into Southampton with thousands of Christmas presents on board. Measuring 396 metres long - or the size of four professional football pitches - the CMA CGM Marco Polo made its maiden call to Britain packed full of goods from the Far East that will be distributed across the UK. Locked away within the stacks of . anonymous steel containers is anything and everything from televisions to soft . furnishings and power tools to clothing. Christmas is coming: The world's largest container ship, the CMA CGM Marco Polo, arrived at Southampton with thousands of Christmas presents on board . The scope of the biggest man-made object to have ever moved across the planet is hard to comprehend: she is longer than the superliner Queen Mary 2 and more than five times longer than an Airbus A380. After unloading her cargo, this true monster of the seas will set sail again tomorrow afternoon, this time bound for Hamburg, Germany. Nicolas Sartini, CMA CGM Group's . senior vice-president of Asia-Europe Lines, said the company launched the South Korea-built ship 'with great . pride'. Making waves: The Marco Polo arrived at Southampton early this morning . Visitors at Southampton Port catch a glimpse of the massive container ship . Bearing gifts: The ship is the size of four football pitches and can carry more than 16,000 containers . Chris Lewis, managing director of DP . World Southampton, which operates the terminal, said today marked 'the latest milestone' in the terminal's history. He added: 'With the container industry changing, these new giants of the sea will soon be regulars at the terminal.' Marco Polo is the first of the next generation of super-vessels destined to keep the wheels of international trade turning. Even Cunard's flagship, the mighty 151,000-ton Queen Mary 2, a familiar sight in Southampton, would be dwarfed by the giant container ship. Technology: Some of the state-of the-art features used by the Marco Polo . Voyage: The routes CMA CGM's ships take from Asia to Europe . The Marco Polo is also far bigger than the nuclear-powered French aircraft carrier, Charles de Gaulle, western Europe's largest warship. Her length is equivalent to well in excess of 100 family saloon cars and the ship can carry more than 16,020 containers on her vast decks. Built by Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering of South Korea, the new ship boasts a vareity of environmentally-friendly technologies, such as an electronically-controlled engine that allows reduced fuel consumption. With an improved hull design, the Marco Polo's CO2 emissions are much lower than the average cargo ship and a ballast water treatment system helps to prevent pollution. Dwarfed: A port worker stands beneath the world's largest container ship . Locked away within the anonymous steel containers is everything from televisions to soft furnishings, power tools and clothing from the Far East . Feeling small: A boat moves alongside the Marco Polo, which is 51 metres longer than the Queen Mary 2 . Ready to unload: More than 16,000 containers will be unpacked before the giant vessel leaves for Hamburg . Over the past 20 years, the size of container vessels has steadily increased. The ship is: . In the 1980s, the average container carried just 1,600 containers, but the Marco Polo has increased that number tenfold. Before the latest giant of the waves arrived on the scene, the Emma Maersk, which was built in 2006 and capable of carrying 15,550 containers, held the title of the world's largest container ship. Southampton Port director Doug Morrison said: . 'We have now placed ourselves on the map as a terminal capable of handling the world's largest container ship. 'We have all the right ingredients to continue being one of the most productive terminals in Northern Europe.' But the Marco Polo might not hold on to her prestigious title for very long. Another two container ships of similar size, each also named after famous explorers, are set to follow Marco Polo next year and will be . capable of carrying a massive 18,000 containers.

"Steven Gerrard is set to miss the next crucial phase of Liverpool's season after tweaking his hamstring during the victory over Tottenham Hotspur. Liverpool's captain came off in the second half of a 3-2 win that has bolstered his side's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League but he is now almost certain to miss the next Barclays Premier League fixture at Southampton on February 22. Aside from that, Gerrard is also set to be ruled out of this weekend's FA Cup tie against Crystal Palace and, in probability, the Europa League last 32 assignment against Besiktas but Liverpool hope the 34-year-old will be available to face Manchester City on March 1. Steven Gerrard has been ruled out until March 1 with a hamstring injury sustained against Tottenham . Gerrard (centre) celebrates after scoring a penalty to make it 2-1 in Tuesday's crucial win over Tottenham . It is another headache for manager Brendan Rodgers, who only 48 hours earlier discovered that Lucas Leiva will miss between four to six weeks with a damaged thigh. Better news, though, is the sustained improvement in Daniel Sturridge's fitness and and the England striker took another step in the right direction against Tottenham. He was frustrated not to score but that tempered by his delight at seeing Mario Balotelli finally create some positive headlines for himself. Mario Balotelli (45) celebrates with Adam Lallana after scoring the winning goal for Liverpool . Balotelli's best game for Liverpool came alongside Sturridge at White Hart Lane on his debut last August and the 25-year-old believes they can combine as a pair going forward. Sturridge said: 'He's been waiting for a while to break his duck and been working very hard in training, and now he has scored one in the league I am sure things will start to go his way now. 'For me it's always about trying to help players who are here, not just Mario, but all the boys who are at the club. It's not easy to settle into a new team, a new area, a new lifestyle, with different people around you and so on and so forth. Daniel Sturridge (centre) wins the penalty after he was adjudged to have been brought down by Danny Rose . 'People don't ever take that into account. I just try to do my bit, although I'm not taking any credit for him scoring – I'm just happy he did.' Sturridge added: 'Whatever team the manager chooses to put out I will do my best whoever I have a partnership with. I try to adapt to whoever I am playing with and bring out the best in each other, and we (me and Mario) click when we are playing together.'","Steven Gerrard will miss the next two weeks after picking up the hamstring injury during Liverpool's vital victory against Tottenham .

"Sergio Aguero allayed Manchester City fans' fears that he could be set for another lengthy injury layoff after being substituted for Edin Dzeko for the closing 20 minutes of their win over Stoke. The Argentine marksman scored in each half, once from the penalty spot, before being taken off after 73 minutes in as Manuel Pellegrini's side dismantled Mark Hughes' men 4-1 at the Britannia. 'For the ones asking I'm OK,' he posted on Twitter in English and Spanish. 'I stepped out only for precaution. Now let's keep on working for the very important upcoming commitments.' Sergio Aguero appeared to be injured when taken off in Manchester City's win over Stoke City . But the Argentine striker tells Twitter followers 'I'm OK. I stepped out only for precaution.' Aguero's eventful night included the best and worst of the prolific striker as he found the net for the first time since his return from a knee injury. The unlikely stage of a cold night in Stoke was what he needed to get back on the score sheet but it was far from a supportive crowd, especially after he handled into the back of the back in an act reminiscent of his countryman Diego Maradona's 'hand of god'. Aguero's opener after 33 minutes was a gem as he showed his superior power and balance against Marc Muniesa, beat Phil Bardsley and shot clinically beyond Asmir Begovic. Aguero drills home his first goal since returning from injury to put City into the lead at the Britannia . His 21st goal of the season came from the penalty spot in the 70th minute to make the score 3-1 . Aguero applauds the travelling supporters after burying his chance from the spot . Peter Crouch's equaliser five minutes later saw the sides go to the break on level terms. City thought they'd reclaimed the lead when Aguero was celebrating his second but replays clearly showed his 'glove of god' moment and the Britannia crowd let him know about it. After consultation with his assistant referee Lee Mason disallowed the goal and booked the striker, who spent the rest of his night as the villain in a panto such were the boos from Stoke's faithful. Aguero's night wasn't all goals and glory with this unsavoury attempt on goal with his gloved hand . Aguero handled the ball into the net in similar fashion to Diego Maradona before being booked by Lee Mason . The City striker could have headed it in following good work from David Silva but put the ball in with his hand . Nevertheless, City were soon ahead legitimately through a James Milner header 10 minutes into the second period. And when City won a penalty Aguero, of course, stepped up to drill it high into Begovic's net for his 21st goal of the season. With the arrival of Wilfried Bony imminent it was a poignant time for Aguero to remind those around him why he's regarded the Premier League's most dangerous striker.","Sergio Aguero scored twice before being taken off for Edin Dzeko .

"A father of eight has sparked controversy by refusing to save money for his children’s college education. Guerilla Parenting author David T. Fagan told the Washington Post that college is 'a lot of wasted time' and if his children want to attend, they will have to pay for it themselves. The 37-year-old marketing entrepreneur, whose family lives in Orange County, California, added to MailOnline: 'The focus is too much on a piece of paper and not enough on self-reliance.' Scroll down for video . Family man: David T. Fagan, a father of eight, says if his kids want to go to college they have to pay for it themselves (center) and their eight children, says college is a resource, not a destination . He continued: 'College isn't necessarily bad - it can be quite good - but it quite often needs to be customized. Kids are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars. Many times, that money could be spent differently and more efficiently in helping people become truly self-reliant.' Mr Fagan says that while he'd approve if his kids, whose ages range from two to 17, paid for school with jobs and scholarships, what he really wants is for them to start their own business, which will ultimately teach them more and be far more lucrative. 'College might help you learn what you love,' he told the Washington Post. 'But it's a method. It’s a process. It’s a tool, it’s a resource. Different priorities: Mr Fagan, pictured with his wife Jill (center) and their eight children, says college is a resource, not a destination . Entrepreneurial spirit: Mr Fagan, now the owner of a branding and promotional firm, moved to California from a small town in Oregon at 17 and persuaded an electronics company to hire him as a salesperson . 'It’s not the destination. Too many people go to college as if that is the finish line. And that’s why you see all these people sleeping on their parents’ couches.' Oregon-born Mr Fagan, who was the oldest of six, says his parents raised him to work for anything he wanted. He left high school after the 11th grade and only briefly attended the University of Phoenix. At 17, he moved to California  and persuaded an electronics company to hire him as a salesperson. Declaration of independence: Mr Fagan and his wife Jill (right) preach the importance of self-reliance to their eight children . Mr Fagan is now the owner of Icon Builder Media, a branding and promotional firm. He believes business skills are more valuable these days than the kind of knowledge taught in school. By the book: Mr Fagan shares his views in Guerilla Parenting, out this January . 'Who are the people who make the most money overall? What are the careers? Sales people. Entrepreneurs. 'Maybe only 10 percent to 20 percent of those sales people or entrepreneurs are really doing well but that 10 to 20 percent of those people are drastically slanting the numbers against anything else,' he says. He says that even if his 15-year-old daughter Taylor, whom he deems 'perfect' for college, becomes an attorney, he will encourage her to open up her own practice rather than working for someone else. Mr Fagan says the biggest problem in society now is the inability of parents to teach kids to go after what they want. 'You very rarely see two or three generations of success in a row because that one person gets the success and what do they say? They say, “I never want my kid to go through what I went through.” When what they went through was exactly what made them a success. 'So what do they do? “I’m going to send you to the best school. I’m going to send you to the best college. I’m going to give you this, I’m going to give you that. I’m going to give you all the things I never had” –without them ever having to work for it. 'And so by giving them things they’re kind of condemning them to a life of mediocrity.' Guerilla Parenting will be released in January 2015.","In his new book, Guerilla Parenting, David T.

"A 28-year-old Oklahoma middle school teacher is facing charging of exchanging inappropriate messages with a 14-year-old student for two years. According to investigators, Whitney Fetters, a Spanish teacher at Hefner Middle School in Putnam City, met the victim when he was 12 years old and the two began sending each other innocuous texts. But police say what started out as an innocent exchange of electronic missives took a criminal turn in December, when Fetters and the student allegedly began conversing via text about sexual acts. Bad teacher: Whitney Fetters, 28, a middle school teacher from Oklahoma, is accused of exchanging inappropriate messages with a 14-year-old student, beginning when he was in her middle school class two years ago . How it started: Police say Fetters (left and right) met the victim when he was 12 years old and the two began sending each other innocuous texts, but their relationship took a criminal turn in December . Place of work: Fetters teaches Spanish at Hefner Middle School in Putnam City, Oklahoma . Fetters is suspected of swapping X-rated photos and videos with the teenager, including sending him nude photos of herself. The 28-year-old woman is expected to be charged with lewd proposals to a child under 16 and soliciting sexual communication through technology. Police learned of the alleged relationship between Fetters and the minor late last month when the student's parents found the pictures and contacted them. Fetters' arrest warrant states that the teacher and the victim began texting when he was 12 and a student in her Spanish class at Hefner Middle School. Court documents cited by News9 indicate that the victim sent the first sexually explicit message, telling Fetters he thought she was 'hot.'

"A British teacher who claims she was gang-raped in Thailand today broke her silence to say that police had treated the attack as a joke. The 20-year-old, who had only been in the country for two weeks, said that officers had made out she was 'some drunk idiot'. And she said that the situation was made even worse by allegations that she had not been attacked and was only crying rape. 'I think I'm still in shock. The first night after I was raped I was very upset, I was tired and cried quite a lot,' she said . 'Now, I can't cry, I just feel numb. As soon as I enter my family's company I think I will just break down.' The alleged scene of the crime: Police comb the second-floor balcony of the building in Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand, where a British student was found weeping . The woman, who is from Fort William, was . allegedly attacked by four men and raped by two of them as she walked . home from a night out at around 3am on Friday. Speaking from the city of Nakhon Si . Thammarat in the south of the country, she said: ''I had had a few beers at a restaurant with a friend and we moved on to a bar where I met another friend. 'I can remember a lot of that then things are unclear, I can only remember little things. 'I do not know if my drink had been spiked or what. There was a kafuffle with the bouncer there and we left at around 2.45am. 'I told my friend that I would get back home fine, it was not too far away. The police have told me that I was told to leave the bar because I was too drunk, but I can't remember if that was true. 'I was awoken on the balcony of a building around 50m away from the bar. Allegations: The British student said she was gang-raped in Nakhon Si Thammarat, southern Thailand . 'The police and other people that lived . nearby woke me up. At that point, I did not have a clue what had . happened or what was going on, but they were saying I was still drunk.' The woman added that she had a clear . description of two of her attackers. She said: 'I do not remember . certain parts of what happened, and I do not remember what order they . are in. 'I can remember a silver car or a pick-up truck and I think that is what the men who attacked me drove in. 'I remember it was raining, I remember there were four of them and I remember the attack happened on a concrete floor. 'I remember quite clearly what the two men who raped me looked like. 'One . was wearing a black T-shirt and the other was wearing a green khaki . T-shirt, he had black hair and a gap in his teeth or a tooth missing. 'They . hit me in the face and on my head. There are bruises on my arms from . where they held me down and my elbows and knees have been scraped.' Police . probing the attack have said they are waiting for forensic reports from . the hospital where she was treated while their enquiries continue. But the woman has hit out at the way the authorities have dealt with her since the assault. She said: . 'I've given three statements to the police using two different . interpreters, I feel like I'm going round in circles with them. 'They tell me one thing and then . another, they've said something about a bouncer at the bar taking me . home and dropping me off, but he can't remember where that was.' She added: 'I still haven't received . anything back from the police, or from the hospital for tests for . diseases following the attack. 'How come no-one in nearby houses . heard anything happening? I was screaming and shouting during the . attack, there's no chance they never heard anything. 'The . police have said the people living nearby just thought it was a fight . and didn't do anything. The police and authorities are very humiliating, . their whole system has let me down. 'They're making out that I was some drunk idiot and it was my fault, which was not the case. Destination: Thailand is popular with British tourists, particularly students, with thousands visiting every year. 'They started asking me questions about my relationship with my boyfriend, which is not relevant at all to this, it just seems like a joke to them.' The distraught woman is travelling home to Scotland after the ordeal forced her to abandon plans to begin teaching in the region. She said: 'It's been a horrific experience and the whole thing with the media has made it a lot worse. 'They have made me look like an idiot who was drunk, they also said my boyfriend had left me at the bar, which he hadn't. 'He was travelling down from Bangkok at the time and had nothing to do with it. 'What they've reported has been quite disturbing.' The young woman called for her attackers to be brought to justice but said she feels like nothing will be done. She said: 'I hope there's some way this can be resolved. Those men need to be caught. I just really want to go home, I want to go and see my family and get proper help, but I'm stuck in a foreign country where no-one speaks fluent English. 'When I get back to the UK I want to report this to the police who will understand me and I want to go to a hospital that can help me after this. 'My family are very supportive, they just want me home as soon as possible.' She added: 'Leaving my boyfriend behind here because he can't get a UK visa just now is terrible. 'We have been living out of each others' pockets for the past few months. But it has ruined everything that I had planned out here.' Jatuporn Mongkolkarun, who owns the bar where the young woman was drinking said that he had instructed a member of security staff to escort the young woman home as she was so drunk. Meanwhile, a witness who lives next door to the alleged victim said she heard her return home at 3.45am. Noi Raksachon, 33, said she did indeed hear a man come to her . room, but he encouraged her to go downstairs for fear that she would . fall from the balcony. She had earlier been in Rock 99 . Bar in Thawang Market before heading to the Nakorn Vientiane Restaurant . - popular because it serves after hours drinks. Police Lt. Col. Niti Boonjan, in . charge of the investigation, said: ‘She had scratches on her body and . she was taken to hospital for forensic tests. She was found crying on . the second floor balcony. Police are waiting the results of forensic tests. If . she is found to have made false allegations, the young woman would face . immediate imprisonment pending trial. She would also be presented with . bills from the police and hospital. In . June last year Stevie Bamford from Sydney, Australia was jailed for 15 . days after making false rape allegations to police on the Thai holiday . island of Phuket. Her sentence was cut in half because she pleaded . guilty. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of a British national having been involved in a serious assault in Thailand.

"Crammed into tiny cages and barely able to breathe, hundreds of dogs are pictured packed into a truck in China destined to be served to diners at some of the country's dog meat restaurants. But the dogs, which were spotted in Guiyang in China's Ghizhou province, were saved by animal activists thanks to a rallying call on a social networking site made by a passing driver. The quick-thinking motorist, appalled at the site of the truck driving along one of the province's main highways, took pictures of the truck and posted them on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. Horrific: The truck carrying dogs destined to be served in restaurants in China was spotted on the highway in the Ghizhou province . Shocking: The animals were destined for the dinner table in restaurants in China before a motorist spotted the truck and alerted animal activists via Weibo . He wrote: 'Many of the dogs are dying, and some have died. Please help!' Some animal lovers who spotted the driver's post immediately took to the road to intercept the lorry while others put in calls to police. Officers were able to track down the lorry and stopped it at the next toll gate. The truck was then taken to a nearby police station and as word of the incident quickly spread online, more animal lovers turned up to help care for the dogs. The trade and transportation of animals in China has long been a subject of contention and has prompted criticism from western animal activists. Outraged: Animal activists helped to intercept the truck and unload the animals from it . Helpers: Animal lovers and vets begin to tend to the dogs once they have been unloaded from the truck . Appalling conditions: Dogs were crammed into the tiny cages and barely able to breath when the truck was apprehended by police . Some of the huge markets which sell dog meat for human consumption came under scrutiny several years ago when they were suspected as the origin of the SARS virus. In one of the huge markets on a 60 acre site in Guangzha, cages packed with dogs are piled high. When a sale is agreed the dogs are reportedly bludgeoned until they are close to death and then handed over to the buyer. Suffering: The rescued animals are pictured recovering after they are released from their cages . Injured: One of the rescued dogs is pictured laying on the ground as he recovers from his ordeal . Last year a group of animal activists were unsuccessful in their bid to stop a truck contaning some 500 dogs which was spotted at a service station on the Jingha Highway after they were attacked by thugs. Another group was more successful when a truck with 505 dogs packed inside was stopped in Yunnan province.

"If anyone questioned Jose Mourinho's deadline day capture of Juan Cuadrado then have a word with Phil Jagielka. It was the deftest of touches midway through the first half, but it had Jagielka - a seasoned international defender - bewildered, looking round for the ball. One second Jagielka was comfortable, goal side and touch tight with Cuadrado. But with an inconspicuous flick of his boot, the Colombian was arrowing into Everton's penalty area. Juan Cuadrado made his first start fro Chelsea in the 1-0 win against Everton on Wednesday night . The Colombian international lived up to his billing after his £27million move from Fiorentina on deadline day . It was a breathtaking moment of skill. The sort of thing that forced Mourinho to pay an initial £23.3million rising to £27m. And on this, his first start for the Blues, Cuadrado, for the most part, lived up to his billing. His ovation ahead of kick-off would have made the South American feel at ease in his new home. And had he been as vocal as those who now chant his name, Cuadrado may well have earned his new team an early penalty after his shot ricocheted onto Steven Naysmith's arm. It looked a blatant spot kick on the replays, and perhaps with a louder appeal, referee Jonathan Moss would have pointed to the spot. Mourinho will surely drum that into Cuadrado in the coming weeks - but on Wednesday night's evidence the Colombian doesn't need a lengthy induction into life at Chelsea. Cuadrado, who could have had a goal and an assist inside 25 minutes, strikes at goal . Manager Jose Mourinho will have been pleased with his new signing's work rate too . He slotted seamlessly into Chelsea's attacking quartet - getting to grips with the fluidity of Mourinho's forward line instantly. He started the game out on the right, but looked just as comfortable through the middle or on the left. Mourinho likes a versatile player, in Cuadrado he seems to have one. He could easily have scored a goal and assisted another inside the opening 25 minutes such was his impact in the early stages. His work rate caught the eye, too. Refusing to allow Branislav Ivanovic to bear the brunt of the defensive duties down Chelsea's right, Cuadrado ensured he was on hand to lend support to his team-mate as they dealt with Naismith's threat. Willian won the game for the Premier League leaders in the closing stages with a long range strike . Willian takes a moment to look to the heavens after sealing a precious victory in Chelsea's title charge . Mourinho wouldn't accept anything less, though. Ask Juan Mata or Andre Schurrle. There wasn't quite the same level of dynamism in Cuadrado's second half display. Perhaps the pace of the Premier League caught up with him. He saw little of the ball in the second period before he was replace by Cesc Fabregas in the 69th minute. But the facts spoke for themselves: a respectable 87.2 percent pass completion rate, two shots, three key passes and 62 touches of the football. Perhaps this display didn't have the razzmatazz of his performances for Colombia during the World Cup. But he showed more than enough to leave Chelsea supporters with a positive first impression. Work-rate, versatility, pace and end product - Cuadrado is your archetypal Mourinho player.","Juan Cuadrado made first start for Chelsea against Everton on Wednesday .

"Police are investigating if a toddler who became unconscious and critically injured was knocked over by his family dogs. The three-year-old boy of Oberon, in the NSW Central Tablelands, suffered head injuries in an incident while walking with his mother and step-father in a park at about 1pm on Sunday. Chifley Local Area Command Crime Manager Detective Inspector Luke Rankin said police were told the boy's injuries were caused after he got tangled in the leads of an Alsatian and a husky when the animals became loose, reported the Western Advocate. Police are investigating if a toddler became critically injured after getting tangled in his family dogs' leads. Pictured are stock images of the two dogs' breeds, an Alsatian, pictured left, and a husky, pictured right . Det Inspt Rankin said police were told the boy had been 'knocked' down and 'stuck' on his head as a result of the incident. 'Our prominent line of inquiry is we are trying to establish if the child has injuries consistent with what the parents have told us,' he said. When the young boy became unconscious, he was taken home where emergency services were called.

"Pep Guardiola has long been touted as Manuel Pellegrini's eventual successor at Manchester City. And so it may not have come as much of a surprise to see the club's academy chief Patrick Vieira taking in the Spaniard's methods as he took training at Bayern Munich. The Frenchman, who is performing well in charge of City's youngsters, was snapped by the German champions along with star left back David Alaba.

"Postmen are refusing to deliver letters to 60 homes on the same street because of an 'unacceptable level of risk' after one of them was bitten by a family's pitbull. Residents of Worcester Road, a cul-de-sac in Whitebirk, Blackburn, Lancashire, have been told they must now collect their post from the local delivery office. It comes after a seven-stone American pitbull belonging to one of their neighbours bit a postman because the child holding his lead was not strong enough to restrain the animal, police said. Big: A family collect of Winston, the seven-stone American pitbull who bit a postman on Worcester Road, Blackburn, leading Royal Mail bosses to suspend all deliveries to the street until further notice . Worcester Road locals have branded Royal Mail's decision to stop deliveries 'disgusting' and 'ridiculous', while the dog's owner said it was 'out of order' to punish the entire street. After the incident last Thursday, residents were ironically informed by letter that deliveries to their street had been suspended with immediate effect. Royal Mail officials told them they could collect their mail from Blackburn Delivery Office in Canterbury Street, about two miles away, and that any post not picked up after 18 days would be returned to sender. They gave no indication of when deliveries would begin again, although the letter did apologise to all affected customers and said staff want to resolve the issue as soon as possible. Cut off: Residents of of the 60 homers on Worcester Road, a cul-de-sac in Whitebirk, Blackburn, Lancashire, have been told they must now collect their post from the local delivery office . Service suspended: Worcester Road locals have branded Royal Mail's decision to stop deliveries 'disgusting' and 'ridiculous', while the dog's owner said it was 'out of order' to punish the entire street . Hayley Sandiford, 28, the owner of the dog, which is called Winston, said animal now faces being neutered - but police and the RSPCA say he is not dangerous. 'He's safe': Winston's owner Hayley Sandiford, 28, says her dog now faces being neutered - but police and the RSPCA insist that he is not dangerous . 'He's never bitten before and everyone round here knows that he is safe,' she said. 'I have a nine-year-old little boy and a five-year-old little girl and Winston is brilliant with them both. He follows them round and is a great family pet. 'On the day of the incident my son had put him on a lead and taken him outside. I never let him do this because I know Winston is too strong for him. 'I was looking after my friend's baby that day and so had just nipped upstairs to get her and in that split second, my little boy disobeyed me by taking the dog outside to show off to his mates. 'I heard my son scream and I looked outside. The postman had seen a dog run towards him, got scared and tried to fend him off. 'Winston had jumped up at him and bit the postman on the arm. The bite had drawn blood. 'The police and the RSPCA have been round and they've said they are happy that he is not a dangerous breed and just advised we get him neutered to calm him down a bit. He's booked in for that today. 'I think that it's out of order for Royal Mail to decided to punish the whole street for this. 'If they said that they wouldn't deliver my post anymore then I'd understand but it's just not fair on everyone else.' Irony: Royal Mail informed the Worcester Road's 60 households that they would no longer get their letters delivered - with this letter . Royal Mail spokesman Val Bodden said . 'Suspending deliveries is always a last resort but we take the health . and safety of our employees very seriously and we are seeking assurances . from the dog owners that their pet will be kept securely while we . undertake deliveries. 'We . apologise to all affected customers and would like to assure them that . we will be working with the dog owners to resolve the situation as . quickly as possible. 'In the meantime, affected customers can collect their mail from Blackburn Delivery Office on the production of photo ID.' A spokesman from Lancashire Police said: 'The dog was on a lead at the time but the lead was held by a child, who was not strong enough to hold on to the animal. 'The postman suffered a wound to his arm and was taken to hospital to be checked over. 'The matter was passed on to the neighbourhood policing team who visited the dog's owner on a joint visit with RSPCA who gave the owner a voucher to have the dog neutered and take it to dog training classes. 'The dog was not a banned breed or classed as a dangerous dog.' Housebound: Winston sits next to the window in his owner's home . Resident Clive Fisher said he had been waiting for a letter from Royal Blackburn Hospital oncology unit after being referred by his GP because he was showing signs of cancer. The 69-year-old said: 'An appointment letter was left undelivered at the sorting office for days. 'There's only a short period of time to treat disorders like this and I know that there's a lot of people that live on this road that do have illnesses or disabilities.' 'I'm disabled but I'm lucky that I have a car. A lot of my neighbours don't or are unable to drive.' Another resident said: 'Why can't they just stop delivering to the house that has the dog? 'My wife is suffering from a terminal illness and she could be missing information about appointments, visits or even test results. 'She's not going to be able to go into town every day to collect the post. It's disgusting.' Blackburn MP, Jack Straw said: 'This is obviously aggravating to the residents but postmen and women face real danger everyday and until they can be sure the area is safe I support them taking this action. 'I'm hoping to meet with residents and Royal Mail to see how this issue can be resolved.'","Seven-stone American pitbull bit postman after child failed to restrain it .

"When she was found abandoned in a carrier bag in a park, this new baby was just a few hours from death, police said yesterday. The little girl, thought to be only a day or two old, was said to be alert and contented as she recovered in hospital. Officers released this picture of the baby - named Jade by hospital staff after the dog walker who found her - in an effort to trace her mother. Scroll down for video . Found: This newborn girl, known as 'Baby Jade', was discovered in a Birmingham park on Wednesday . Safe: The girl is now recovering in hospital, but police have not yet tracked down her mother . Jade had been wrapped in a towel . inside a bag and left in Marlborough House Community Park, Birmingham, . where she was found at 2pm on Wednesday. The umbilical cord was still . attached. Roger Wilday raised the alarm after making the discovery as he walked his dog Jade through a community park in the Stechford area . of the city. The 68-year-old was led to the newborn by his pet, who refused to leave the child's side until Mr Wilday came to investigate. 'Jade . has grown up with children around her, she loves babies and when she . found the baby in the bushes she wouldn't leave until she knew I had . seen it,' the retired engineer said. 'She . is a hero dog. There was no-one else in the park at the time and it was . very cold. If it wasn't for Jade that baby could have been dead. Newborn: Jade was apparently no more than a day old when she was abandoned in Birmingham . 'I always take her to the park and we . were out walking - she was off the lead and headed off towards the . bushes. She wouldn't come back when I called her and so I had to go . over, and I saw the bag and then I heard a baby cry. 'I . reached down to look at the bag closer and I saw there was a baby . inside wrapped in a light blue blanket. I dialled 999 and picked the . baby up, and within a minute the police and ambulance were here. 'She . was a tiny little thing, you could tell she must have been recently . born, she was still warm so I don't think she had been there long.' West Midlands Police have . released several photos of the girl and a heartwarming Instagram video in order to raise the likelihood . of someone recognising her. Chief . Inspector Ian Green said: ‘Paediatricians have confirmed the baby was . lucky to be found when even just a few more hours exposed to the . elements could have had fatal consequences.’ Police hope forensic tests on the bag and DNA samples from the baby will help identify her. Hero: This dog, named Jade, found the newborn in a carrier bag hidden in a bush yesterday . Hunt: Police are scouring the park in Stechford in an effort to find clues about Baby Jade's origins . Mr . Green added: ‘I’m told she’s very alert and a contented, happy . baby … but of course what she really needs is to be in her mother’s . arms. 'Thankfully, we now know she's safe and . well - and our priority is very much on finding her mum to ensure her . safety and to provide whatever support she needs. He urged the unknown woman to call police on 101. Baby Jade, who weighs around 6lbs, is currently being treated in Birmingham Heartlands Hospital. Officers are continuing to make house-to-house inquiries near the park where the baby was found. Mr Green added: 'We're still keen to hear from witnesses who were in the park yesterday - especially anyone who saw somebody with a carrier bag from The Entertainer toy shop - or anyone who believes they could have information that will lead us to identify the mother.'","Newborn has been nick-named 'Baby Jade' by staff treating her in hospital .

Provided clubs provide adequate stewarding for their matches and have CCTV to monitor any disturbances, the FA feel it is impossible to stop fans from turning up and throwing objects from the stands. Newcastle manager John Carver claimed afterwards that the coin could have left his player blinded. ‘I have seen it and it misses Colo’s eye by an inch – another inch and it could blind him, Carver said. ‘You can’t have that in this game. I hope the authorities deal with it and I’m sure they will because it will be on TV every other minute and rightly so. Let’s find out who it was and sort it out. ‘It just can’t happen, can it?

"The shopping trolley bag so beloved of grannies may be a familiar sight in the post office queue, but it has never been the chic shopper’s choice — until now. This winter, two of fashion’s biggest names have launched luxury designer versions of the humble wheelie bag. Of course, you’d have to win the lottery before you found yourself trundling Louis Vuitton’s £14,100 version or Chanel’s £6,025 edition around Waitrose. But the rediscovery of the shopping trolley goes beyond Paris’s poshest labels, and this season they are the accessory of choice for stylish shoppers everywhere. Indeed, one brand, Sabichi, has seen sales leap by almost 40 per cent in the past two months alone. So, which are more It Bag than Old Bag? We pick the shopping trollies you can pull along with pride... Scroll down for video . MONOCHROME MAGIC . Rolser four-wheeler Mono trolley, £69, Thetrolleyrevolution.com . This sturdy trolley by upmarket Spanish brand Rolser is solidly constructed from metal and high-quality plastic. It also has a smooth folding mechanism both in the centre (to halve it in size for packing away) and on the wheel configuration, which you can switch from four wheels to two for a speedier ride round supermarket corners by pushing the stand down. As a result, it’s easy to manoeuvre. The bag itself is strong and light, in thick waterproof fabric, with an internal pocket for bits and bobs. Trolley bags are measured in litres and this one will hold 48 — that’s nearly 85 pints of milk. The top pulls closed with a duffel bag-style toggle, beneath a flap with a press-stud that protects the top from rain. The only disadvantage is that the wheeled height is non-adjustable, so if you’re planning on wearing heels to do your shopping, you may find yourself having to stoop to grab the handle. STYLE RATING: 4/5 . CHINTZY CHARM . Sabichi Bon Bon shopping trolley, £24, sabichi.co.uk . This pretty two-wheeler brings a touch of chintzy charm to your shopping with its delicate pattern and polka dots — and at £24 it is also one of the cheapest on the market. While the fabric feels light, it is well put together and has a thermal lining, making it perfect for transporting frozen food. At 40 litres (that’s a potential 80 tubs of Haagen-Dazs), it is still pretty big but the fastening is a little flimsy: just a small square of Velcro holds the trolley’s flap down. The wheels have good rubbery tyres, although it won’t take long for their white sheen to look grubby. The wheels, like the bag, are supplied unconnected to the frame, but after a couple of false starts we found them easy to put on (make sure they are clicked properly into place) — although you may not fancy banging the bag up and down kerbs. STYLE RATING: 3/5 . DOTTY FOR DOTS . Polka Dot Wheelie Bag, £34.99, lakeland.co.uk . This is a Tardis of a trolley. In spite of its apparently small size, it has a 40-litre capacity. Its clever design means you can either remove or drop the handle to carry it as a relatively normal-looking tote bag. The top and the front and back pockets all zip up, so it feels secure, and there’s a side pocket for a brolly. It doesn’t feel as sturdy as some of the larger trolleys, though —and that pink bow looks cheap. STYLE RATING: 2/5 . CHEAP AND CHEERFUL . Knalla shopping trolley, £22, ikea.com . There’s no denying that this trolley is a budget option. Yes, the pattern is cheerful. But the 42-litre bag feels a little flimsy and, over the drawstring fastener, the flap is held down with little plastic twist-locks that feel as if they might snap off if used too vigorously. Yet for £22 it’s not bad value and features a convenient adjustable handle that works like those on suitcase trolleys, so it will suit both dainty women and their taller sisters. Its two rubber wheels have decent treads so it should have grip on a muddy day, and although it rattles somewhat cheaply when moved around, it would be great for occasional use. The removable interior pocket is a nice touch to avoid scrabbling around for small items such as keys or purses, and there’s an extra flat zip pocket on the back of the bag which would be handy for a newspaper or magazine. STYLE RATING: 3/5 . FRENCH FANCY . Perigot market trolley, £63.50, selfridges.com . This trolley from chic French homewares brand Perigot is all about understated style. It feels contemporary thanks to the nicely finished details such as slender handles, double stitching on the bag, a soft foam grip, two very smooth-rolling wheels and a minimalist aesthetic. The laminated waxed canvas makes the bag seem waterproof and hardy, and it looks smaller than its 40-litre capacity — there’s plenty of room to stuff it with mineral water bottles. It has an internal pocket for small items and a side pocket for an umbrella — though it would probably be better with a zip over it to keep the rain out. Then again, that would ruin those pared-back, utilitarian-chic lines. The main drawback? In colour and fabric, it’s ever so slightly Royal Mail. STYLE RATING: 3/5 . STEADY CRUISER . Typhoon shopping trolley, £54, debenhams.com . This two-wheeled trolley from Typhoon feels solid and well-made, and is easy to fold away. The 40-litre bag is sturdy, too. Even better, it has an inner insulated bag with a drawstring top that allows you to separate cold or hot products and keeps them at the right temperature, making it a great choice for the big supermarket shop. The main bag also pulls tight with a drawstring, but the Velcro fastening is less than secure and strangely positioned — one side of the Velcro runs horizontally and one vertically, so it holds only lightly in the centre. The bag feels agile, though, looks a little more eye-catching and cheerful than most trolleys, and there’s no rattle at all on the wheels — you certainly won’t get the wild careering of the average supermarket trolley. STYLE RATING: 4/5 . RETRO HIT . Coates willow basket trolley, £76.10, englishwillowbaskets.co.uk . This will certainly create a stir at the farmers’ market: it’s made in Somerset from willow grown in the county’s wetlands using methods this family company has employed since 1819. Wicker is incredibly long-lasting if looked after and this is a sturdy item — and although its lack of cover reduces its practicality on rainy days, it is perfect for holding a bunch of flowers without crushing them. It’s a lovely, tactile object and, as it’s not too tall, there’s no scrabbling around for lost items. Best of all is its strong walking-stick handle and stand.

"A group of gypsies has been driven out of a Belgian town after the mayor hired a DJ to blast rock music at them. The Roma had amassed 30 caravans at a site in Landen, a small town with a population of less than 15,000, around 30 miles east of Brussels, with no plans to leave. But after a DJ played Dire Straits at a volume of 95 decibels - equivalent to the sound of a pneumatic drill from 50 feet away - they caved in and agreed to go. Scroll down for video .

The gypsies had initially agreed with a landowner to park 14 caravans at the site in Flemish Brabant province until Tuesday, according to Landen mayor Gino Debroux. But since arriving on Sunday, they had reportedly amassed a further 16 vehicles. 'Since then, they've said they won't leave and they're there with 30 caravans,' Mr Debroux told Reuters via phone earlier this week. 'This is an industrial site and is not designed for camping.'

The drastic measure has sparked a range of reactions of social media, including some from fellow members of Mr Debroux's socialist Sp.a party. 'Not OK, what happened in Landen.

"Randy Lerner waited a considerable time before dismissing Paul Lambert, their close relationship making the American keep faith when supporters had long given up. But, with Aston Villa in the relegation zone and 13 Premier League games to go, the club’s owner cannot afford too much deliberation with his next decision. Despite no little talent, the players look bereft of confidence and ideas. Some are not pulling their weight. An instant injection of impetus is needed if Villa are to avert the impending disaster of relegation to the Championship. Paul Lambert was sacked as Aston Villa boss on Wednesday after the club slipped into the bottom three . Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner kept faith with Lambert due to his close relationship with the Scot . Step forward Tim Sherwood? Ever since leaving Tottenham at the end of last season he has been the man near the top of every vacancy list. His availability in a sparse field of credible managers made him a candidate for the jobs at West Bromwich Albion, Crystal Palace and Queens Park Rangers. Now he is the favourite to step into the Villa Park hotseat. His Premier League experience amounts to just five months in charge at Tottenham, but he left White Hart Lane with the highest win ratio (59 per cent) of any manager at the club in the Premier League era. He was a compelling character and forceful personality, unafraid to speak his mind to a formidable boss in Daniel Levy. Villa need a spark to lift the mood and generate a turnaround in results. Judging from his time in north London, Sherwood would provide that. Aston Villa are in need of a major lift after a season of struggle and inability to find the net this campaign . Former Tottenham boss Tim Sherwood could be the man to lift the mood and change results at Villa Park . Lambert, understandably tired after three seasons of continual struggle, had resorted to using clichés when talking about the challenge ahead for Villa. ’13 cup finals,’ he said of the remaining Premier League matches. It was the same term he used last season. The squad need to hear a different voice, an opinion that will compel and inspire. Tactically too, their play has been muddled. The switch from direct football to a possession-based game seemed like a sensible plan for long-term stability but has resulted in tedious fare. Just 12 goals in 25 games is a statistic that even those averse to data crunching can comprehend as terminal. Sherwood displayed at Spurs his ability to generate a lift in results and a good style, improving players and handing debuts to younger talents. Tottenham trio Nabil Bentaleb (left), Harry Kane and Ryan Mason (right) were handed starts under Sherwood . He does not yet have the UEFA Pro Licence coaching qualification required by the Premier League but has been working towards it with the Welsh FA and that should satisfy the authorities. Sherwodd has his UEFA A and B qualifications. The problem has come in each of his rumoured reprisals when discussions turn to wages. At West Brom last summer, he looked on course for the job until demanding £2.5million a year, plus sizeable packages for his assistants. A man who knows his worth, you might say. And that is fair enough. Still being paid by Tottenham as part of his severance package, Sherwood does not have to accept less than what he feels is his value. Sherwood is still being paid by Tottenham and has been linked to a host of vacancies since his departure . His reunion with Chris Ramsey and Les Ferdinand at QPR hit the buffers in similar circumstances, though, a job that seemed tailor made. Villa, with its history and financial stability, represents a better long-term bet – and there is a growing sense Sherwood needs to take an opportunity before it is too late. For the right man, Lerner will find the necessary funds. Desperate to avoid relegation to the Championship, and the disaster that would spell for his ambitions to sell the club, he is willing to pay well to get that bounce that will see Villa above the dreaded dotted line come May. Sherwood was expected to link up once more with Les Ferdiand (left) at QPR but the move didn't come off . Whether he feels this is Sherwood remains to be seen. Ideally, he would turn to a manager well-versed in steering sides clear of danger. But Tony Pulis has already pitched up in the midlands and is doing just fine at West Bromwich Albion. Sherwood would be a gamble given his inexperience in these waters, but short-term at least, he may represent the best out there. Long-term, Villa are in serious need of lasting change, they need to conduct a proper search of candidates, stage an in-depth recruitment policy. Right now, though, there is not time for that. Right now, Sherwood is available.","Tim Sherwood is the bookmakers favourite to take over at Aston Villa .

"The scoreline was deceiving at Old Trafford on Wednesday evening. Yes, Manchester United scored three times against Burnley but the performance did not do anything to silence the doubters of Louis van Gaal's side. Here, Sportsmail's Mike Keegan looks at what we learned from United's 3-1 victory over Burnley. Robin van Persie (left) celebrates his penalty with Wayne Rooney (centre) and Marcos Rojo (right) Chris Smalling (third left) scores his second goal of the evening against Burnley on Wednesday . United manager Louis van Gaal saw his team given a tough time by relegation strugglers Burnley . Wayne Rooney, defensive midfielder? United fans had called on their talisman to be shifted upfront from his place on the right of the diamond, bemoaning a waste of his attacking talents. Like having Rolls Royce and leaving it in the garage, said some. Little did they realise that when he was moved it would be backwards take over the holding role from the injured Blind. A bizarre sight, Rooney cleaning up in front of the back four but credit to the England man, he took on the responsibility like a captain and led his team to victory. Wayne Rooney (second left) dropped further back into midfield after Daley Blind went off injured . Blind (centre) hobbled off in the first half and Rooney filled in and played the rest of the game in his place . Ander Herrera has not been kidnapped . Has played just 56 minutes this year with conspiracy theorists in meltdown. Had he run over Van Gaal's cat? Did he follow Anderson to KFC? At £29m the Dutchman's first signing has hardly been given a chance to impress. Tonight, however, he got it. When he came off the bench to replace the injured Blind Old Trafford erupted in ironic cheers. Will have enjoyed a rare run out but did not do much to leave United fans wondering what they have been missing. No doubt desperately short of match fitness. Ander Herrera (centre) replaced Blind when he went off injured after 39 minutes at Old Trafford . Herrera (left) did not do much to impress during the 51 minutes he played for United against Burnley . Are the natives getting restless? They have been resolute in their backing for Louis van Gaal but are United fans reaching the end of their tether? Consensus in the press box was that the prolific Chris Smalling's second goal on the stroke of half-time saved Van Gaal's men from being booed off at the break. Credit to them, though, while shouts of frustration were audible this is still an onside crowd who back their man. Chants of Louis van Gaal's red and white army started in the K Stand and seemed to lift United a level. Like last year under Moyes, they deserve credit. Watching United is not as fun as it used to be. The United supporters were frustrated at their team's performance, especially in the first half . Smalling's second goal for United shortly before the break helped ease the supporters' nerves in the game . Is the problem of Di Maria being solved? This was more like it. Playing on the left of the diamond and terrorised Burnley on the break and relished getting out wide. He had come under-fire for lacking desire but covered every blade and even landed himself in the book for a late challenge which will have delighted the United faithful. Laid Smalling's second on a plate from a short corner that worked. A short corner that worked! Won the penalty and finally began to look at home in a red shirt. Yes, tougher challenges lie ahead but this was impressive from the £59.7m man. Angel Di Maria (right) impressed in United's victory and his commitment to the cause will please United fans . Di Maria (lower) was brought down by Scott Arfield to earn the penalty that team-mate Van Persie converted . Danny Ings is the real deal . It's not hard to stand out in Burnley's tin foil away kit but Danny Ings shone the brightest with a zesty performance that caused United's defence no end of problems. Almost unplayable in the first-half with no disrespect to Sean Dyche's Lancashire battlers you get the impression that in a stronger side he might have a similar impact to Harry Kane at Spurs. He really does look that good. Striker Danny Ings (right) found the net for his fifth goal in six Premier League games on Wednesday .

"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini repeated his desire to keep James Milner after the club's fans chanted his name throughout a 4-1 win at Stoke City on Wednesday night. Milner, City's best performer this season, was outstanding again at The Britannia, and scored their decisive second goal with a towering header. Man City midfielder James Milner marks goal against Stoke with 'joke' DJ celebration . The 29-year-old is out-of-contract at The Etihad Stadium this summer and keeping his options open with Liverpool and Arsenal among a number of clubs interested. But thousands of travelling supporters made their feelings clear by repeatedly signing: 'James Milner, we want you to stay.' Pellegrini said afterwards: 'Milner scored a beautiful goal but for us the most important thing is the way he works for 90 minutes. Milner scored decisive second goal with a towering header on Wednesday night . 'To sign a contract, you need both parties. I repeat, the club want Milner to stay here and Milner has to decide what he wants to do with his future.' Sergio Aguero scored his first goals since December 3 as City won in the Premier League game for the first time since New Year's Day. They remain seven points behind Chelsea but with Barcelona next up in the Champions League, Pellegrini accepts keeping Aguero fit – he recently missed five weeks with a knee injury – is key to their prospects this season. Manager Manuel Pellegrini wants Milner to commit his future to Manchester City . 'The most important thing for Kun is that he can play. The more minutes he has, the better he is. We know what he can do.' Aguero, who also had a goal disallowed for handball, was substituted with a tight hamstring but expects to play against Newcastle on February 21. Stoke manager felt Milner escaped an early penalty appeal after Peter Crouch's header hit his arm but said: 'Once Man City went 2-1 up, they picked us off.'","James Milner capped impressive display with goal against Stoke City .

"Referee Jon Moss 'wilted' under pressure from Chelsea players and sent off Gareth Barry, according to Everton captain Phil Jagielka. The Toffees were  level when Barry received his marching orders for a second yellow card late on for a tackle on Willian following an earlier booking for bringing down Juan Cuadrado. Jose Mourinho's men appeared quick to surround Moss and Jagielka believes the referee was influenced to show the red card before Willian scored a last-minute winner for the home side.

Tim Howard replaced Joel Robles in goal after returning to fitness and looked like keeping a clean sheet until Willian's late strike after Chelsea had a goal ruled out just minutes earlier. 'Tim's made some pretty good saves and (Petr) Cech has made a couple as well but you think your luck is in when the deflected goal is ruled out for offside,' explained Jagielka. 'Then there is a mad two or three minutes. Then to compound the misery, the ball deflected two or three times and went in the bottom corner.'

"The Football Association are poring over video footage of Branislav Ivanovic’s altercation with James McCarthy in Chelsea's win against Everton on Wednesday night. The Chelsea defender appeared to aim a headbutt at McCarthy and then there were suggestions he tried to bite him. The FA have already started investigating the entire melee involving players from both teams and are waiting on the report of referee Jon Moss and his match officials due this morning. Both teams could be charged for failing to control their players. VIDEO: Scroll down for Does Branislav Ivanovic bite down on James McCarthy's shoulder?

They are trying to establish exactly what went on before deciding on the appropriate course of action. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho refused to discuss the issue after the match and is sure to be furious if the FA take any action against his player.

That would pave the way for the FA to take retrospective action and impose a three-match ban, which would rule Ivanovic out of the Capital One Cup final against Tottenham. Mourinho feels his team are being victimised by match officials and the media, in the wake of Diego Costa being retrospectively banned for three matches for a stamp on Emre Can. The Portuguese questioned why Robin Van Persie was not banned for appearing to aim an elbow at James Tomkins in Manchester United’s draw with West Ham. Referee Marck Clattenburg saw that incident and opted to give Van Persie a talking to, leaving the FA powerless to take further action. Martin Keown – I think he's just about going to get away with this, there's not enough in it in terms of making contact with his head. He'll get away with it for me. Steve McManaman: I don’t think it was worth a red card, Jon Moss, the referee didn't see the incident - it's up to the law makers now. Robbie Savage: I've seen a lot worse but can you grab someone around the throat and do that? If the referee sees the movement towards McCarthy it's a red for me. Michael Owen: It’s a yellow for me - nothing more. Phil Neville: It's not clear cut enough for the FA to ban him for three games, for me. It’s not good what’s he done granted, but I don’t think the FA will take action.","Branislav Ivanovic may face retrospective disciplinary action .

"Australia captain Michael Clarke has lost his race to be fit for Saturday's blockbuster World Cup opener against England. Coach Darren Lehmann confirmed that Clarke would not play at the MCG despite the 33-year-old's quicker-than-expected recovery from hamstring surgery. Clarke pulled on an Australia shirt for the first time in two months on Wednesday night, hitting 64 and bowling two overs of spin, as his side finalised their World Cup preparations with a 188-run win over United Arab Emirates. Australia will not risk their captain Michael Clarke (left) for their opening World Cup match against England . The Australia captain has been racing against time to recover from a hamstring injury . Australia coach Darren Lehmann admitted Clarke was slightly disappointed at being kept back . That sparked speculation Clarke could be set for an early return against England, after Cricket Australia had initially set him a deadline of proving his fitness by the February 21 match against Bangladesh. But Lehmann confirmed the plan remained for Clarke to return against the Tigers. 'No he's not playing Saturday,' Lehmann said. 'I'm happy with the way he pulled up, really happy with his progress and we're going to stick to the plan. He'll play against Bangladesh.' Lehmann said Clarke's hit-out against the UAE could not have gone better, but that he and the medical staff were not willing to take any risks over his comeback. '(I'm) really happy with the way it has gone,' Lehmann added. 'The way he batted, ran, fielded, bowled - he ticked all the boxes. Now it's about a good solid week and get ready for Bangladesh.' Clarke is expected to return for Australia's second match against Bangladesh on February 21 . Clarke celebrates with team-mates after a successful run out against the UAE in a warm up match . Clarke has worked tirelessly around the clock to get himself back to fitness after suffering the injury during the first Test against India in early December. Lehmann hinted that Clarke had been slightly disappointed to be kept in cotton wool for what looms as one of the biggest matches of the tournament. 'We've just had a chat. He's respectful of what we're trying to do to get him right,' he said. 'He's a quality player and a quality leader and while we would have loved to have him available for this game we're making sure he's 100 per cent ready to go for Bangladesh.' While Clarke will miss the game his opposite number, Eoin Morgan, enters it with concerns over his form after he was dismissed for a third duck in four innings in England's final warm-up match against Pakistan. Since hitting a century against Australia in the tri-series opener Morgan has got out four times in 18 balls during a miserable return of 0, 2, 0, 0. 'I'd like him to continue that run against us on Saturday, but he's a fine player,' Lehmann said. 'We'll come up with our plans as we did in the tri-series, they seemed to be working.' England captain Eoin Morgan turns to rugby during a practice session in Melbourne . Morgan has suffered a disastrous run of batting form in the build up to the World Cup . Australia will also be missing James Faulkner . Lehmann expects an MCG full-house will provide the perfect starting point for Australia's bid to claim a record fifth World Cup title and denied suggestions playing at home could work against his team. 'I hope a lot of Australians come out to watch that first games - 90,000 people is going to be fantastic to see,' he said. 'The players are going to be in for a thrill. It's going to be exciting times for both teams and hopefully we get fantastic support.' India are the only home nation to have won the World Cup, when they lifted the trophy four years ago. 'There's pressure on any team at any World Cup no matter where you are playing,' he added. 'For us it's about embracing our own country, entertaining them and playing the brand of cricket we have done in the last 18 months in the one-day format. 'If we do that the results will look after themselves. I'm only worried about England in the first game.' Australia will go into the game with only 13 fully-fit players with all-rounder James Faulkner to sit out alongside Clarke with the side strain he suffered in the tri-series final. Lehmann believes Faulkner is on track to make a return during the World Cup after it was initially feared his tournament could be over. 'He's batting comfortably now so that's a good sign for us,' he said. 'We're dictated by the medical team with that and hopefully he'll resume bowling very shortly.'","England take on Australia in their opening World Cup game on Saturday .

"England have named an unchanged team for Saturday's RBS 6 Nations clash with Italy at Twickenham. Head coach Stuart Lancaster has retained the same starting XV and bench after Wales were dispatched 21-16 in Cardiff in the Championship opener, a result that saw England replace Ireland as new title favourites. Lancaster had hoped to pick Geoff Parling as specialist second row cover among the replacements at the expense of Nick Easter or Tom Croft, only for the Leicester lock to suffer a setback in his recovery from a knee injury. England coach Stuart Lancaster has championed consistency by naming an unchanged side against Italy . Jonathan Joseph breaks away to score in England's opening 21-16 defeat of Wales at the Millennium Stadium . 'It's always good to be able to name an unchanged team and to build some consistency. We did the same last year after France heading into the Scotland game,' Lancaster said. England were able to report a clean bill of health despite a full-blooded encounter at the Millennium Stadium that saw Anthony Watson and Jonathan Joseph cross in each half. Joseph, who alongside lock George Kruis will be making his first international start at Twickenham, resumes his promising centre partnership outside Luther Burrell with George Ford pulling the strings at fly-half. Joseph will be making his first international start at Twickenham along with George Kruis . Fly half George Ford will once again orchestrate England's play in the Six Nations . Anthony Watson, who scored England's opening try against Wales, will be given another chance to shine . Tighthead Dan Cole is given another chance to gain match fitness after a year interrupted by neck and foot problems, while on the other side of the scrum Joe Marler continues to be first choice loosehead. England have never lost to Italy in 20 matches dating back to 1991, but have won by only seven points or less in three of their last five matches. The rivals' last meeting at Twickenham two years ago saw Lancaster's men prevail just 18-11 through six penalties from Toby Flood. Geoff Parling (centre) has failed to recover from a knee injury in time to be included among the replacements . England players celebrate in the dressing room after their unexpected victory over Wales . England, who start as 1/100 match favourites, have finished Six Nations runners-up on points difference for the last two seasons and must seek to rout Italy knowing the Championship's weakest team can also prove dogged opponents. 'Italy are going to be fired up, they always are when they come to Twickenham - especially after last week's loss to Ireland,' Lancaster said. 'We know what's coming at us, but we have prepared well and are looking forward to getting back home and playing in front of our fantastic supporters.'

"After Wednesday night's resounding 4-1 victory over Stoke, Manchester City had more to be cheerful about as Yaya Toure returned to training.

Since Toure left the Etihad, City had managed just three points from three draws in the Premier League before the 3-1 victory at the Britannia - and they crashed out of the FA Cup to Championship leaders Middlesbrough. Having scored his spot-kick in the Ivory Coast's 9-8 win over Ghana in the final, Toure looked ahead to City's challenge of retaining the title. ‘With my confidence I know football is not about one game or two games, especially in the Premier League,’ he said. ‘We have 38 games and if we want to achieve it (retaining the title) we have to win all the games. ‘I know it is difficult but now I have to go back and do my duty again.’ The first opportunity to begin that difficult challenge will be on February 21 against Newcastle.

"There was a moment, less than a minute into Jose Mourinho's appearance after Chelsea's victory over Everton, when the threat was real and the mood was menacing. 'One more question I leave, so I'm more concerned with my reaction, so one more question and I will have to go,' claimed Chelsea's manager. Mourinho was back in 'Campaign Mode', driving the Chelsea battle bus towards another ridge in the road. He left us with another cliffhanger. Because this is Chelsea, because this is Mourinho, the repercussions and the recriminations will last for days. How sad that is. Scroll down for video . Jose Mourinho refused to discuss the melee towards the end of Chelsea's win over Everton . The Chelsea boss threatened to walk out of his press conference if he was asked another question . Branislav Ivanovic aggressively wraps his arm around Everton midfielder James McCarthy . Ivanovic (third right) appears to aim a headbutt in the direction of McCarthy . The incident took place during a melee shortly before Chelsea scored the winner through Willian . Mourinho had just been asked about the moment in the 88th minute when Gareth Barry's dopey challenge on Willian caused an almighty rumpus in front of the two technical areas. In real-time Mourinho jumped out of his seat, followed wearily and predictably by the concertinaed figures of coaches Rui Faria, Steve Holland, Christophe Lollichom and Silvino Louro. Ramires was waving an imaginary card at referee Jonathan Moss, for which he was booked, and Chelsea's bench were demanding the return of capital punishment down there. Scenes like that make you want to cough up blood. What followed was the ugly side of the game, with players from Chelsea and Everton puffing out their chests and pretending they are all hard as nails. For the FA the focus on Thursday morning will be on Branislav Ivanovic, the Chelsea defender who was accused on social media of biting Everton substitute James McCarthy. The video is inconclusive. Mourinho cut his usual animated figure on the touchline as he watched his league leaders win again . The resulting free-kick led to the decisive goal and Ivanovic was involved. His header was punched out unconvincingly by Tim Howard to Willian, who struck the winner. Ivanovic is likely to be charged with violent conduct for shoving his head into the side of McCarthy's left ear before Chelsea's captain John Terry and Didier Drogba could eventually drag the doofus away. Lovely player and all that, but even the great players lose it from time to time. And when Mourinho was asked about the apparent headbutt, he threatened to walk out. The Portuguese, last month fined £25,000 for saying there was a 'clear campaign' against Chelsea, was not prepared to discuss the possibility the Serbia defender could be banned. He had earlier told BT Sport: 'Did Branislav Ivanovic go in with his head? Don't make me laugh. Don't make me laugh.' Mourinho delivers a withering look as he stood firm on not answering questions about Ivanovic . And in an interview with the BBC, when asked if he would punish a player if replays showed he had committed an offence, the Portuguese ended the interview, saying: 'Sorry. See you tomorrow.' Everton boss Roberto Martinez felt the Serbian should have been dismissed. The Spaniard said: 'Ivanovic's behaviour is wrong. 'He grabs James McCarthy around his neck in a very forceful manner, then he puts his head against him when James McCarthy never reacted one single bit. 'If you want to be on top of the laws that's a red card.' Mourinho has already shown his displeasure at Diego Costa being suspended retrospectively for three matches for stamping on Liverpool's Emre Can. The Blues boss, who could be fined by the Premier League for opting out of media duties surrounding last month's draw with Manchester City, continues to imply his side are unfairly treated. Willian fires home Chelsea's winning goal as Everton's resistance is finally broken . Tim Howard is left stranded as Willian's shot flies past him to earn Chelsea all three points . Willian heads to the corner flag to celebrate and is soon joined by his Chelsea team-mates . Two decisions went in favour of Everton in the opening quarter of the contest, when the ball hit Steven Naismith's arm in the penalty area in the fourth minute and when Barry made two fouls in quick succession, but was booked only for the first offence. Mourinho added: 'I'm tired of stories and I'm never tired of football. Football is emotion and what we had here. 'A discussion because of a red card, a red card that should be given in the first half, because Barry should be sent off in the first half. 'He pulled Hazard. The second yellow card should be given there.' Mourinho had no complaints with referee Moss' performance. 'I think it's a clear penalty. I also think the referee had a fantastic performance,' the Blues boss added. 'The official that disallowed the goal, it was a fantastic decision.' Mourinho felt Gareth Barry should have been shown a second yellow card for pulling Eden Hazard's shirt . Barry was eventually sent off in the second half for his part in the melee . REPORTER: The mass confrontation between the players at the end... MOURINHO: You know, I'm tired of stories. I'm never tired of football and football is emotion and football is what we had here today. A discussion because of a red card that should be given in the first half because [Gareth] Barry should be sent off in the first half because he had a yellow card. He pulled Hazard when Hazard goes to attack a defender so second yellow card should be shown there. So nothing, nothing important. REPORTER: How concerned are you that Branislav Ivanovic might face retrospective action? MOURINHO: I'm concerned about my reaction because one more question I leave and after that you're not happy. I'm more concerned with my reaction because the next question for that story, I have to go. REPORTER: Do you think you should have had a penalty? MOURINHO: I think it is a clear penalty but i think the referee had a fantastic performance. [It is] a very difficult performance when the game is one team defending, recovering the ball and playing it to [Romelu] Lukaku. This for a referee must be a nightmare. He has to be focused on one box then suddenly a long ball and the ball is faster than the referee. So I think [it was a] very difficult match for him but very stable performance. And the official that disallowed the goal was a fantastic decision.","Branislav Ivanovic was involved in a clash with Everton's James McCarthy .

"It is an astonishing image of a unique city. This incredible panoramic image was taken 828 metres above sea level, from the top of the tallest building on earth, Dubai’s Burj Khalifa. Composed of over 70 individual photos, it recreates the view Tom Cruise made famous as he sat at the tower’s peak during the filming of Mission Impossible Four, ‘Ghost Protocol’. Navigate around the interactive image below (may not work on all mobile devices) The top of the Burj Khalifa, developed by global property developer Emaar Properties, is over 200 metres above the highest point reached by the building’s elevators, which reach the 160th floor at speeds of some 10 metres per second. The tower’s public observation deck is on the 124th floor. The journey to the pinnacle involves a steep ladder climb within the 200-meter spire that crowns the building. It takes in Dubai’s many landmarks, including the iconic Burj Al Arab hotel, the world’s biggest mall, the Dubai Mall and the Meydan Racecourse and shows the remarkable growth of a city still on a fast track to developing as a business hub and tourist destination. Dubai based photographer Gerald Donovan created the shot using a mechanised panoramic tripod head to take a series of 48 panoramic images, each shot at a resolution of 80 megapixels. Mr Donovan was given access to the  top of the Burj Khalifa, developed by global property developer Emaar Properties. It is over 200 metres above the highest point reached by the building’s elevators, which reach the 160th floor at speeds of some 10 metres per second. The tower’s celebrated public observation deck, at the top, Burj Khalifa is on the 124th floor. The journey to the pinnacle involves a steep ladder climb within the 200-meter spire that crowns the building. These were then stitched together with manually shot images to ‘fill-in’ gaps caused by equipment installed at the top of the tower such as the lightning conductor and aircraft beacons. The result is an image that can be zoomed, tilted and rotated, giving viewers a sense of how it must feel  to sit on top the world’s highest building. One of the astonishing 360 images from the top of the 828 metre high Burj Khalifa in Dubai . The image has been released to celebrate the second Hamdan Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Photography Award (HIPA), which will take place in Dubai in March. The award, the world’s richest photography award, will see prizes totalling $389,000 and attracts entrants from 99 countries, with a grand prize of $120,000. 'This is an extraordinary image taken from an extraordinary location,' said His Excellency Ali bin Thalith, the General Secretary of the award. 'It . reflects the goals of HIPA, to extend the boundaries of photography and . celebrate images of unusual beauty and quality that are truly . outstanding,' Photographer Gerald Donovan climbing to the top of the tower to set up his equipment . Dubai based photographer Gerald Donovan said he has wanted to take the photographs for several years. 'I've always wanted to – ever since seeing the first designs of the building,' he told MailOnline. 'The Burj Khalifa is a perfect building for shooting a 360 degree pano from the top of, because its 'roof' is only 1.5 meters across. 'This means that you can shoot from a single location and capture the entire view, without the building itself getting in the way (aircraft beacons and lightning conductors excluded!). 'I shot a 45 gigapixel panorama of the Dubai skyline in April 2010 – at the time, the world’s largest ever digital panorama, and thought that a panorama from the pinnacle of the Burj Khalifa would be a great way to top that. 'As long as it was big enough to make it interesting to zoom around in, it didn’t need to be 10’s or 100’s of gigapixels. 'It’s all about the view. Nothing can top that view – it is a unique place. 'Since the time of the Great Pyramids, remarkably few buildings have held the title of 'World’s tallest structure on land'. 'The Burj Khalifa is only the 15th in over 4,500 years of human history. 'It’s a very, very special building, and hopefully people will appreciate it even more now that they can see the view from the top. 'It’s all about being able to take people up there “virtually” and share what I experienced for real, and I hope people enjoy it!' Tom Cruise is one of the few to have see the incredible view from the top of the towers, when he performed a stunt for Mission Impossible 4.

"Ralph Ellis runs you through what we learned from the midweek round of fixtures... with some star turns and a look through the leagues, too. This week sees reason to celebrate for Kurt Zouma and Harry Kane, but less so for Edin Dzeko. 1 Kurt Zouma’s middle name is Happy – and the young French defender has every right to feel that way after starting to force his way into Jose Mourinho’s thinking. The 20-year-old is emerging as a genuine threat to England centre back Gary Cahill’s place alongside John Terry after getting picked in six of Chelsea’s last nine games. The 1-0 win over Everton was the fourth of those in which Chelsea have kept a clean sheet. Kurt Zouma has impressed in Chelsea's defence since featuring more often alongside John Terry . 2 Harry Kane is emerging as a candidate to join only three players to have ever collected both the PFA Young Player and Player of the Year awards in the same season. The 21-year-old Spurs striker is already a shoo-in for the Young Player prize after his explosive arrival in Mauricio Pochettino’s team. But if he keeps up his current rate he could well follow former Spurs idol Gareth Bale who won both prizes two years ago. After scoring at Liverpool Kane now has 13 Premier League goals despite not getting a start in the Tottenham side until November. That’s exactly the same number Bale had scored at the same stage of the 2012-13 season – and he’d been a regular in the team. 3 Edin Dzeko scored 26 goals in all competitions for Manchester City last season but now finds himself as the striker with most to fear from Wilfried Bony’s arrival. When £28million new boy Bony gets back from the Africa Cup of Nations it will push the Bosnian striker even further down the pecking order. Hauled off after an hour when City failed to beat Hull on Saturday, he was used only as a sub for the last 17 minutes of the 4-1 win at Stoke and has only once played 90 minutes in the Premier League all season. Edin Dzeko will be pushed further down the pecking order at Manchester City with the arrival of Wilfried Bony . 4 Tony Pulis might have a reputation for producing committed teams but he also insists on discipline and will want to sort out new signing Callum McManaman. The £4.75million man arrived at West Brom from Wigan with a reputation for reckless tackling, with a red card and five yellows already this campaign. And he was fortunate to escape with only a yellow for a lunging tackle on Swansea’s Jefferson Montero during Albion’s 2-0 win. Callum McManaman (right) has shown no sign of curbing his committed style since joining West Brom . 5 Graziano Pelle seems to be starting to feel the pace of his first full Premier League season, or maybe defenders have begun to work out the 29-year-old Italian. Pelle exploded on to the scene at Southampton with nine goals in his first 12 matches for Ronald Koeman’s team. But the former Feyenoord striker has now gone eight Premier League games without a goal following the 0-0 draw against 10-man West Ham. Graziano Pelle has failed to find the net for eight games after a bright start to the season for Southampton . 6 Joel Ward spent the early part of the season being switched around the Crystal Palace line-up under Neil Warnock, including a spell when he had to do a job at left back. Since Alan Pardew took over he’s been moved back to his best role at right back and his performances have been one of the keys to Palace’s run of just one defeat in seven games under their new boss. Pardew has kept an unchanged back four in every one of those matches. Joel Ward has been instrumental in helping Crystal Palace pull clear of the relegation zone . 7 Many asked why David Moyes didn’t keep Mike Phelan at Manchester United when he took over from Sir Alex Ferguson and the question has even more relevance following his impact at Hull. Apart from a brief spell helping out at Norwich the experienced 52-year-old had been out of work since he followed Fergie out of Old Trafford. But in two matches since Bruce recruited him to halt his team’s slide into the relegation zone Hull have taken four points. Mike Phelan (right) has helped Hull take four points from their last two Premier League matches . 8 Malky Mackay will have to win his next four matches at Wigan to have a better record after 17 matches than the one which got Uwe Rosler the sack in November. Owner Dave Whelan lost patience with Rosler when he’d taken just 16 points from the first 17 games despite signing 11 new players in the summer. Mackay has been allowed to bring in eight fresh faces, but after the 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest has just six points from 13 matches. Malky Mackay has struggled since taking over from Uwe Rosler at Wigan in November . 9 Nigel Clough has used Sheffield United’s profits from their run to the Capital One Cup wisely in signing Rochdale winger Matt Done. The 26-year-old whose career started at Wrexham then Hereford had 14 goals already this season when he signed for the Blades – and that is now 15 after marking his debut by scoring in the 4-1 win over Colchester. Clough’s side go to League One leaders Bristol City on Saturday with a chance to get into the promotion shake-up. They are in sixth place, but with two games in hand on most of their rivals. 10 Paul Buckle’s return to English football after spending time in America is reaching crisis point at League Two Cheltenham. The 44-year-old built a strong reputation taking Exeter then Torquay to play-off finals, but after flopping at Bristol Rovers and Luton needed a success story when he was put in charge at Whaddon Road following the controversial sacking of long-serving boss Mark Yates. The 2-0 defeat at Southend means he has won only once in 13 games, and the Robins were forced to deny stories he had been sacked in the wake of the defeat.","Chelsea kept another clean sheet with Kurt Zouma alongside John Terry .

"Manchester United have seen a drastic fall in broadcasting revenues due to a lack of Champions League football, the club's latest financial figures show. The Old Trafford outfit's debt has also risen by almost £24m in the space of three months. Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, however, pointed to the new Premier League TV deal and 'strong revenues' which he said demonstrate they are in a strong position. Manchester United's debt has risen by almost £24m in three months while broadcasting revenues have fallen . But executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward is optimistic for the future with the club's 'strong revenues' Woodward also says that United are in a strong place for a top-four finish this season under Louis van Gaal . He added that Louis van Gaal's men are now well-positioned for a top-four finish. The figures are for the second quarter of the financial year. Broadcasting revenue dropped from £46.9m for the same period last term to £28.4m, a fall of 39.4 per cent while matchday revenue dipped from £33.7m to £30.9m. Woodward put that down to a lack of Champions League football at Old Trafford after last season's seventh-placed finish. United predict that revenues for this season will be between £385m and £395m which would be a drop of around £40m from the previous campaign. But officials believe that with the new TV deal secured and cash from their world-record £750m kit deal with adidas to drop, the future looks bright. United are paying for a lack of Champions League football after David Moyes lead them to seventh place . The Old Trafford club spent big in the summer, including with the wages of Radamel Falcao (right) United prepare for a Champions League clash with Real Madrid back in 2013 . With regards to the debt, which is up from £356.6m to £380.5m, they claim it is down to the strength of the US dollar and are known to be comfortable with the situation which can potentially be beneficial for tax purposes. Woodward said: 'The recently announced Premier League broadcasting rights package for 2017-19, representing an increase just over 70%, once again demonstrates that we are part of the top football league in the world. 'Notwithstanding no European football this season, our Revenues and EBITDA remain strong and demonstrate the underlying strength of our business model, with commercial revenues up year over year. On the pitch, the team is well positioned to challenge for a top four finish in the Premier League and we look forward to the rest of the season.' United also lost around £1.2m in merchandising thanks mainly to the terms of thier existing deal with Nike that features penalties for non-participation in the Champions League.","Manchester United finished seventh in the Premier League last season .

"A pest control expert who hides out in client's bedrooms before shooting the animals claims to be Britain’s first urban fox hunter. Tom Keightley, 56, camps in clients’ upstairs bedrooms where he waits for the nocturnal creatures to come out before shooting them with a .22 air rifle. Fully-licenced Mr Keightley from Croydon charges up to £350 to kill a family of foxes and says he can exterminate between six and eight a night. Pest control expert Tom Keightley charges up to £350 to shoot urban foxes from people's windows . The man says he has been receiving calls to his UK Urban Foxes firm from hundreds of concerned residents about the pest problem. He said: 'The vixen tends to stay underground and the male comes up and does his work at night mainly so that’s when I do most of my work. 'I tend to shoot them because it’s quicker and kinder. Some people trap them first and then shoot them but they might be in the trap for hours, which isn’t very humane. 'Most of the time I shoot from one of the bedroom windows and they don’t know I’m coming. An urban fox on a terraced house in London. Mr Keightley, 56, says he has been receiving calls to his UK Urban Foxes firm from hundreds of concerned residents . He said: 'It is legal. Foxes don’t have the same protection as, say, a badger. I always let the police know when I’m going to shoot a fox. I have a firearms certificate as well. 'This has nothing whatsoever to do with fox hunting. 'They’re urban foxes so it’s completely different. You’re not going to get a bunch of hounds running through a London suburb.' Mr Keightley is contracted to DEFRA to respond during animal disease outbreak dealing with infected livestock in the field. He is also on the police call out system to humanely deal with deer or other animals injured in road traffic collisions. He has been trained by the humane slaughter association (HSA) The British Deer Society. Mr Keightley, who DEFRA contacts to kill animals humanely during disease outbreaks, says he always notifies the police when he is going to shoot a fox and insists his work is legal . The grandfather added: 'I quite like foxes really. In the countryside they don’t do much harm. But they are not welcome in cities. 'Animal rights campaigners say that 50 per cent of young foxes are killed on the roads, and that is enough of a cull, but I think that’s ridiculous. 'It’s crazy to rely on motorists to control any animal population - the damage to cars and potential loss of life is too great. 'And more often than not the foxes suffer, because they’re not killed straight away. I cleanly kill the foxes, as painlessly as possible.' Mr Keightley, who has been killing the animals since he was 16, say they rarely suffer as they die instantly . 'I haven’t got a problem with foxes, I quite admire them really. If they were in danger of becoming extinct I wouldn’t kill them. 'I wouldn’t like to be the one to kill the last remaining fox, put it that way.' A spokeswoman from The RSPCA said today: 'The RSPCA will always urge non-lethal methods of deterrent where possible as shooting foxes will simply encourage other foxes to move in from other areas and take their place . 'The most sustainable and long-term solution to discourage foxes from an area is to remove or prevent access to the things that are attracting them to the area, such as food and shelter.' 'There are restrictions on some of the methods that might be used to kill them but otherwise foxes do not have specific legal protection. 'Providing that the person has the appropriate firearms certification for the weapon used, is on land that they either own or have permission to be on and is not shooting so as to pose a safety hazard then there is no offence committed.'","Tom Keightley, 56, charges up to £350 to kill a family of urban foxes .

Lambert said in a statement issued through the League Managers' Association: 'I am extremely proud to have managed Aston Villa, a founder member of the Football League, and this sentiment will always remain with me. 'My initial remit was to conduct a massive overhaul of the playing squad, lower the overall wage structure of the playing staff and achieve this whilst keeping the club in the Barclays Premier League. 'There was also a concerted effort to purchase and develop younger players who would provide a solid footing for the football club to move forward and enhance the value of the playing squad in the future.

"Eoin Morgan has brushed aside concerns over his form ahead of England's World Cup opener against Australia. The England captain has scored just two runs in his past four innings, including consecutive first-ball ducks against Australia, ahead of Saturday's clash at the MCG. '(I'm) not really that concerned,' he said. Eoin Morgan says he isn't too concerned by his recent patchy form as England prepare to open their World Cup campaign against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday . Morgan tries a bit of rugby on the training ground at the MCG ahead of England's World Cup opener . The England skipper appeared to have some acumen for the oval-ball game . 'I went through a bit of a bad patch before Christmas and I feel, since I started with the Sydney Thunder at the Big Bash, I've started to turn things around. 'I've had a couple of low scores but I'll look to cash in on Saturday if I manage to get past 10-20 balls.' The left-hander is taking comfort in the fact that it was only at the start of the tour that he defiantly hit a century against Australia at the SCG. 'I think it is four or five games since I scored a hundred so I don't have to look that far back to actually reconnect with what works well for me,' he said. 'I took a lot from that hundred I scored at Sydney, particularly because it was against Australia, and the first game is a big game against Australia so I'll take a lot of confidence from that game.' Morgan (middle) shares a joke with Ian Bell (left) and Joe Root during England's training session on Thursday . Coach Peter Moores (right) joins in the hilarity as Bell, Morgan and Root crack the jokes . Gary Ballance runs with the ball during a game of touch rugby in training at the MCG on Thursday . He added: 'I find it really easy to reconnect with the past and what I do well and can be very individually focussed when the chips are down. 'I've done that in the past on a number of occasions when I've gone through low scores. I know that I have done it and come out the other side.' If Morgan was looking to move on quickly from the subject, he was given little chance to do so. The first question from the home media focused on his bizarre dismissal in Wednesday's four-wicket warm-up defeat to Pakistan in Sydney. Morgan somehow managed to direct his third delivery, a full toss from leg-spinner Yasir Shah, to slip and he was reluctant to re-live the moment 24 hours on.. 'My dismissal was I played a shot that I played, maybe, thousands of times,' he said. 'Usually it results in the ball going over 45 on the leg-side. It didn't. It caught the top edge and went to slip.' Asked if that was a concerning to get out given his form, he added: 'No'. James Anderson takes over possession as England make their final plans for Saturday's Australia opener . Morgan cracks a joke with bowlers Stuart Broad, James Anderson and Chris Jordan in training . Morgan takes a catch during fielding practice at the MCG on Thursday . Morgan was equally as brief when asked to discuss news from earlier in the day that his opposite number, Michael Clarke, would definitely miss the match as he continues his much-talked about return from hamstring surgery. 'It doesn't really bother me,' he said. 'Whatever team they put out doesn't really bother us. It's really important that we focus on what we do.' Morgan confirmed that England would not name their team until just before the match, although they are likely to call upon at least six World Cup debutants. With a sell-out 90,000 MCG crowd set to be baying for English blood it promises to be a baptism of fire for England's young guns. They do have prior MCG experience, however, with only Moeen Ali and James Taylor having not played a competitive match at the ground, and Morgan believes that not only can his players handle any white-hot atmosphere, but that they have played in more hostile venues. 'It is certainly going to be a challenge,' he said. 'In regard to the ground it is quite a big stadium. The majority of our guys have played here before - there's only two that haven't - and the guys that have played here before say that although it is a fantastic venue to play when you are in the middle you are so far away from the crowd.

Chris Woakes returns the ball during a fielding drill at the MCG as England get ready for the World Cup . England gather for a team talk on the outfield ahead of their training session . 'It's a big AFL oval, so in regards to places where we've played before where it is quite intimidating, it's not on top of you.' Morgan then sought to pour the pressure on Australia - and co-hosts New Zealand who England meet in their second group game - by suggesting such a large home following could be detrimental. 'They've had a good run of it, as have New Zealand for a while, which probably makes Australia favourites and New Zealand second favourites and with that brings a lot of pressure,' he said. 'I know sometimes it is a nice pressure to have, in front of your own fans, there will be 90,000 fans cheering them on - but if it goes against them it will be interesting to see how they react.' Regardless of the crowd England will need to arrest a poor recent one-day record against Australia in their own backyard - they have lost 13 of their past 15 games - if they are to begin the tournament with a win. More recently they lost all three games in the tri-series, including a 112-run defeat in the final, but Morgan remains confident his team can pull off an opening-night shock. 'If we can produce what I believe is our best cricket on Saturday we'll be able to beat Australia,' he said.","England skipper not worried by scoring just two runs in past four innings .

"Eden Hazard is currently lighting up the Premier League with his skills, flair and dribbling ability. He is arguably the favourite for the PFA Player of the Year award. And it also turns out that the in-form Chelsea winger is the most fouled player in the league this season, with opposing players being penalised 74 times. That works out at roughly three times a game; Hazard's twisting and turning is obviously too much for defenders at times. But who else makes the list? Eden Hazard has been fouled 74 times so far this season - the most in the Premier League . Hazard holds his neck during Chelsea's clash with Everton at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night . In stats provided by Opta, Liverpool starlet Raheem Sterling is second after drawing 60 fouls so far this season. Hazard and Sterling's game provokes challenges from defenders, and are often too quick with their low centre of gravity, so their status at the top is unsurprising. Arsenal's player of the season so far Alexis Sanchez is also up there, but he is beaten to No 3 spot by Steven Naismith. The Scottish forward has drawn 52 goals this season to Sanchez's 47, despite playing one less game than the former Barcelona man. Santi Cazorla is also in the top 13, as is Southampton winger Sadio Mane with both being fouled 41 times. Gabriel Agbonlahor (56), Remy Cabella (45), Leroy Fer (45), Stephane Sessegnon (44), Jack Colback (44), Connor Wickham (41) and Alexandre Song make up the list, but Hazard is the clear winner. The Belgian has scored nine times this season and has added consistency to his game as Chelsea have opened a seven-point lead over Manchester City at the top of the table. Opposing defenders have been penalised 60 times for fouling Liverpool starlet Raheem Sterling this season . Everton forward Steven Naismith (pictured tussling with Liverpool's Jordan Ibe) is third on the list . Charlie Adam picked up a yellow card for this foul on Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez, who has drawn 47 fouls . He has been praised by manager Jose Mournho, who has also bemoaned the frequency of fouls on Hazard on several occasions. 'The first free-kick of every game is somebody kicking him,' the Portguese boss said last month. 'He has fouls and fouls and fouls. I don't see many yellow cards. Sometimes a yellow card is a consequence of violent conduct, but I also think that accumulation of small fouls is also violent conduct. 'The kid is suffering the consequences of that, but playing amazingly well.' Jose Mourinho has praised Hazard for his performances this season but says defenders target him in games .","Eden Hazard has been fouled 74 times in the Premier League this season .

"The head of Boston's transit agency has abruptly quit her $220,000-a-year job after the closure of the area's transport service for more than 24 hours twice in the last fortnight. Beverly Scott, 63, general manager of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, announced her resignation in a letter to the board. She gave little explanation for her reasoning, but said she would work until April 11 to enable a smooth transition. Beverly Scott, 63, general manager of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, has resigned after coming under fire for the closure of the transport service in the greater Boston area twice in two weeks . Boston has been hit by extreme weather in the last month which has ground its public transport to a halt . The 'T' decided to suspend rail service completely Tuesday to try and recover from the extreme weather . In her resignation letter she said: 'During these past two years-plus, it has been an absolute pleasure and honor to serve with and lead this dedicated team of transit professionals and public servants. 'In my almost forty years in this industry, I have not worked at a public transportation system with such a personal connection to the people and communities it serves.' Her decision comes after another tough week for the transit agency. The 'T' decided to suspend rail service completely Tuesday to try and recover from the extreme weather. Charlie Baker, the governor of Massachusetts, expressed his dissatisfaction earlier this week at the closure of the transit system, describing the MBTA's performance 'unacceptable'. But he said Scott was doing everything she could to deal with the 'unprecedented' weather conditions. Scott's resignation came a day after she offered an impassioned defense of the 'T', citing historic snowfall and years of under-investment. 'We are running an extremely aged system that is getting a pounding,' Scott said, adding that it needs 'serious, bold' reinvestment to operate reliably. Amid the snowfall, Charlie Baker, governor of Massachusetts, called the MBTA's performance 'unacceptable' The storm on Tuesday left the Boston-area with another two feet of snow and forced the MBTA to run buses on a limited basis, and suspend all rail service for the day  to clean tracks and repair equipment . But following her departure, it was revealed Ms Scott had jetted off at taxpayers' expense almost every month since she took the job in December 2012. A review of her monthly expense reports by the Boston Herald reveals she spent 106 days travelling out of state, taking 30 trips in 24 months. During that time, Ms Scott racked up $56,753 in expenses on lodging, airplane tickets and dining tabs, including at least $1,132 on hotel laundry and dry-cleaning bills. Her impending departure leaves the MBTA, which includes the country's oldest subway and a network of buses, ferries and commuter rail lines, without a long-term leader. 'I suspect that she didn't see any light at the end of the tunnel,' said Robert Prince Jr., who led the T from 1997 to 2001 and considers Scott a friend. 'And if she does, it's another train coming at her.' In a statement, the MassDOT board's chairman, John Jenkins, said he was 'stunned by the resignation of Dr. Scott.' He added: 'Be clear, this Board has had no discussions at any time about her tenure as General Manager. 'We hoped and expected that she would fulfill her three year contract, which ends in December of this year. 'I want to thank Dr. Scott for her skillful and committed leadership over the last 26 months, and wish her the very best as she moves on to her next challenge.","Beverly Scott, 63, head of Boston's transit agency, has abruptly quit her job .

"Former Manchester United defender Paul Parker has launched an astonishing attack on club captain Wayne Rooney, branding the striker 'awful' and calling for him to be dropped after the arrival of Radamel Falcao. The prolific Colombian has arrived at Old Trafford on a season-long loan deal and Parker, who made more than 100 appearances for United between 1991 and 1996, believes that should spell the end of Rooney's time in Louis van Gaal's first team. The 50-year-old also blasted Rooney's performance in Saturday's lacklustre 0-0 draw with Burnley and questioned why he earns a reported £300,000-a-week. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Wayne Rooney: Falcao is a sign of intent from United . Under fire: Former Manchester United defender Paul Parker has criticised the performances of Wayne Rooney . Outspoken: Parker, pictured in action for United (right), believes Rooney should be dropped for Radamel Falcao . Not good enough: Parker says Rooney was 'awful' against Burnley and questioned the money he earns . After discussing Robin van Persie's disappointing display at Turf Moor in his Yahoo! Sport blog, Parker wrote: 'As for Wayne Rooney, he's been awful. There he was at Burnley this weekend, supposedly captaining the team - but I saw a player interested only in himself, doing nothing to try and lift his game or inspire his team-mates. 'The only thing in any way remarkable about his performance is that he collects £300,000 a week to play that badly.' The loan deal for Falcao has left many pundits coming to the conclusion that Juan Mata will drop to bench, leaving Rooney to play as a No 10 and Van Persie up-front with the club's latest signing. But Parker thinks otherwise. New boy: Parker believes Rooney should be dropped and Radamel Falcao (pictured) should start for United . Glory days: Parker evades a tackle from Chelsea's Gavin Peacock during the 1994 FA Cup final at Wembley . Frustrated figure: Rooney has scored just one goal in three Premier League games so far this season . He added: 'Once Van Persie is fully-fit again, Rooney must be the person to be dropped from United's new attacking line-up: for me, it'll be RVP and Falcao every time. And though there's lots of talk about him playing in the hole behind that front two, I think that'd be a huge mistake - why would you have Rooney there when Juan Mata or Angel Di Maria would do the job so much better?' Rooney was made captain by Van Gaal over the summer after the departure of Nemanja Vidic to Inter Milan, but Parker feels the Dutchman will not shy away from benching his skipper. 'That'll leave Van Gaal with a big call to make: dropping Wayne Rooney,' he wrote. 'He's always shown in his career that he's not afraid of the big decisions; he showed it most recently with his goalkeeper substitution for the shootout at the World Cup, and he'll have to show it once again because the way things are looking there will be no place for Rooney in that starting line-up soon.'

"Manchester United teenager Saidy Janko celebrated his league debut with a stunning goal that ended Bolton's winless run and left Championship rivals Fulham looking over their shoulders at the bottom three. Janko, who joined Bolton on loan last week as part of the deal that took Andy Kellett to Old Trafford, showed Louis van Gaal what wingers can do by smashing a right-foot shot past Marcus Bettinelli after 80 minutes to help his new club mount a deserved comeback. 'It was a miraculous goal,' said delighted Bolton boss Neil Lennon. 'Saidy is very old school, he takes the full-back on and tries to beat him.' Shaun Hutchinson celebrates after giving Fulham the lead at the Macron Stadium on Tuesday night . Eidur Gudjohnsen rolled back the years to level for Bolton just before half-time . Fulham led after 21 minutes when Shaun Hutchinson turned in from close range but 36-year-old Eidur Gudjohnsen, captaining Bolton for the first time, levelled shortly before the interval with a clever finish from Janko's cross. Bolton dominated the second half but had to wait until Janko's right-foot hammer to go ahead. And in the final minute, Fulham's misery was complete when Bettinelli cleared straight to Le Fondre in and the striker finished into an empty net. Saidy Janko scored with 10 minutes remaining to put the Trotters ahead against Kit Symons' men . Adam Le Fondre scored his first goal for Bolton to put gloss on the scoreline in the 89th minute . Talking about 19-year-old Janko's contribution, Lennon quipped: 'You would like to think he was happy, but you never know because he is so level-headed. 'You could see he was a bit tentative early on but once he got up and running, he put the turbos on. While Bolton celebrated their first win in six matches, Fulham are now only five points clear of Millwall in the final relegation place and their manager Kity Symons admitted: 'We have to get our own house in order.'","Bolton came from behind to secure 3-1 win at home to Fulham .

"Daryl Murphy has been the recipient of private tuition by Ipswich coach Terry Connor in a bid to find the net more often, and boy is it paying off. So far this season the pair have spent hours together after training perfecting the fine art of finishing; nobody was more pleased to see Murphy score the equaliser and his 19th of the campaign to turn this fixture just after the break than Mick McCarthy’s right-hand man. Ipswich fell behind to Kieran Lee’s 20th-minute strike, thanks to a terrible mix-up between goalkeeper Bartosz Bialkowski and Christophe Berra, but their talisman spearheaded a comeback which saw them rise to fourth in the Championship.

Murphy cleverly flicked beyond Kieren Westwood before Luke Chambers careered from right back to meet substitute Kevin Bru’s cross to head in the winner . So, what’s changed for a striker who previously saw goalscoring as an infrequent hobby rather than a career? ‘Wonderful management and coaching,’ McCarthy joked. ‘He’s got the No 9 on the back now. It’s about momentum. He’s reaping the rewards for working hard - extra training on Fridays. ‘It would have been a travesty had we lost that one. We contrived to give a goal away but deserved it.’ Sheffield Wednesday's Joe Mattock (left) gets physical with Ipswich winger Stephen Hunt . Ipswich midfielder Teddy Bishop drives forward with the ball under pressure from Lewis McCugan . The age of a £5billion Premier League is still over a year away, but Ipswich are insistent that they will grace it well before then, becoming one of the three top-flight newbies next season. Monies on offer to promoted clubs remain astronomical next year, of course, and the Tractor Boys want a piece of those riches. When you boast a striker such as Murphy, that’s always a distinct possibility. Murphy earlier struck a post; so too did Darren Ambrose, making his third full debut for the club for whom he began his career, while Sheffield Wednesday manager Stuart Gray opted not to speak afterwards.","Kieran Lee fired the visitors into the lead in the 20th minute .

Ramsey takes over from Harry Redknapp who resigned due to problems with his knees. Rangers chairman Tony Fernandes had tweeted on Tuesday that he thought he had secured his 'dream manager' which led to a flurry of bets on Michael Laudrup.

QPR chairman Tony Fernandes will appoint Chris Ramsey as Rangers boss until the end of the season. Here Sportsmail look at five key issues he needs to address to ensure they beat the drop. AWAY FORM . Despite picking up their first win on the road against Sunderland last time out, the previous 11 matches did not yield a single point for Rangers. With Arsenal, Tottenham and Chelsea still to come to Loftus Road, their away form could be the key to ensuring their Premier League survival. LEAKY DEFENCE . Rangers have the joint worst defensive record in the league and, with goals also at a premium, tightening up at the back is a must. Harry Redknapp failed to identify his preferred central defensive partnership so finding a system that gets the best out of Rio Ferdinand and Steven Caulker could make the difference. SHARE THE GOALS . Charlie Austin has contributed 50 per cent of QPR's goals in the Premier League and that form has rightly led to talk of a potential England call-up. But Ramsey will be looking for someone else to help shoulder the scoring burden, especially with the former Burnley man not having scored in open play since the December win over West Brom. CALM JOEY BARTON DOWN . This may be easier said than done, with the combative midfielder becoming the first player in Premier League history to be cautioned in seven consecutive matches. Barton's leadership qualities and never-say-die attitude are far more beneficial on the field than off it, so avoiding suspensions is crucial. INTEGRATE A SQUAD OF EGOS . Barton, Adel Taarabt, Ferdinand. None of the three are afraid to speak their minds and they are not the only squad members with chequered pasts. Sandro and Mauro Zarate have also had high-profile disagreements with managers and Ramsey will need to forge a team ethos to stand any chance of survival.","Chris Ramsey has been named as successor to Harry Redknapp .

"Liverpool assistant manager Colin Pascoe believes Emre Can could be a future club captain but in the short term he may just have to settle with assuming Steven Gerrard's midfield role. Gerrard is awaiting results of a scan on a hamstring problem which could keep him sidelined for a fortnight and with Lucas Leiva already out for between four and six weeks with a thigh problem, the side are looking light in central midfield. Can, who arrived from Bayer Leverkusen in the summer as a midfielder but has adapted to defensive role in a back three, stepped in briefly in midweek when Gerrard went off in the win over Tottenham. Liverpool assistant manager Colin Pascoe believes Emre Can could be a future club captain . Can arrived from Bayer Leverkusen in the summer as a midfielder but has adapted to play in defence . Vice-captain Jordan Henderson and Joe Allen are the only two fit senior central midfielders with Can another option, although his success in defence may mean Brendan Rodgers is reluctant to move him. Asked whether Can's calmness under pressure and quality on the ball makes him a potential future captain Pascoe said: 'He is young, he is learning his game, but in years to come I am sure he will progress to be one of them. 'He is a leader on the pitch and the way he is playing he has been fantastic. 'But at the moment he himself is probably not even looking at that sort of thing.' On the possibility of Can being restored to midfield Pascoe added: 'When we were monitoring him to come into Liverpool he could play at centre-half but the opportunity arose for him to go into a back three - where he has been fantastic. Can has impressed since taking his role in a back three and is likely to be kept there by Brendan Rodgers . The Liverpool player looks relaxed during a training session at Melwood on Thursday afternoon . 'But you could see the other night when he stepped into midfield he does want to play there, it is his position, and he is a great asset. 'He is a great lad and a good player. He hasn't moaned about anything or knocked on the manager's door, he has waited for his chance and grabbed it with both hands. 'If Emre Can had to go into midfield there is another possibility but with Jordan and Joe there we have enough cover.' With Mario Balotelli scoring his first Premier League goal to win the match against Spurs there is renewed hope the Italy international will be able to make something of a so-far disappointing career at Anfield. Can celebrates with his team-mates after they beat Tottenham 3-2 at Anfield in their Premier League clash . Fellow summer signing Mario Balotelli scored his first goal for the club during the win against Tottenham . The problem he has is Daniel Sturridge is back to full fitness and in the current 3-4-3 system there is really only room for one out-and-out striker. However, Pascoe admits the goal has not done Balotelli any harm. 'Mario is Mario. He comes in every day, works hard. He is one of those guys who when he is out there he wants to work well,' said the assistant boss, standing in for manager Brendan Rodgers who was returning from Italy on player-related business. 'It was great for him the other night when he got his goal. 'It is not about one player, it is about the group, and the next game with all the players available. 'He has put himself out there for selection for the next game with his contribution the other night. 'Every team is picked for certain occasions.

"Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott warns the government has 'absolute determination' to prevent 'returning jihadis' who are a threat to the country. The PM's call to protect the nation's borders from extremists comes as the Weekend Australian reveals a handful of Australians are participating in executions of captured Iraqi prisoners in the war torn country. Several Australian Islamists, including a convicted terrorist, have appeared in social media images carrying out bloodied executions during the two-week Iraqi insurgency. The group are believed to be fighting with the extremist Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS). Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott warns Australia will do its 'damnedest' to ensure the 'returning jihadis' never come back to the country . Mr Abbott believed up to 100 Australians are involved in groups fighting in Iraq and Syria: 'Some of them are involved with this murderous, murderous AL-Qaeda splinter group,' Mr Abbott said, (referring to the  ISIS). Some of them are involved in atrocities.' He said Australia can't afford to have 'trained killers who hate our way of life, who hate us, making mischief with the potential to cause mayhem in our country'. A spokesman for Defence Minister David Johnston confirmed that a small Australian Defence Force 'liaison element' had been sent to Iraq to bolster security arrangements at the embassy in the country's capital Baghdad. Mr Abbott said Australia can't have 'trained killers who hate our way of life, who hate us, making mischief with the potential to cause mayhem in our country'. 'The important thing is to ensure that as far as is humanly possible, they don't come back into our country,' he told Macquarie Radio on Friday. 'And if they do come back into our country, (that) they are taken into detention. 'Secure borders is not just a question of stopping the illegal (asylum-seeker) boats that have been coming to our country under Labor,' Mr Abbott said. 'It's also a question of ensuring that we don't get these jihadists coming back to our country trained up in the techniques of death and destruction.' Up to 100 Australians are believed to be involved in groups fighting in Iraq and Syria . Australia will do its 'damnedest' to ensure they never come back to the country, he said. 'And if there are some that we have to take back, we will make sure that they are not a threat to the Australian community,' he said. He said the opposition had been offered a briefing on the government's plans to stop returning jihadists.

"Liverpool will continue to be patient with Daniel Sturridge before finally giving him the green light to play 90 minutes. The England international played 74 minutes of the 3-2 win over Tottenham on Tuesday, having previously launched his comeback from a long standing thigh problem with substitute appearances against West Ham, Bolton and Everton. Sturridge is eager to play a full game now that he has had no reaction and Saturday's FA Cup tie against Crystal Palace would seem an obvious point to play a full game. However, Liverpool assistant manager Colin Pascoe revealed the club will continue to treat Sturridge with kid gloves to eliminate any chance of him suffering a reoccurrence.

"Manchester City's senior stars have defiantly claimed the Premier League title race isn't over despite Chelsea's last-minute winner against Everton on Wednesday night keeping Jose Mourinho's men seven points clear at the top. Captain Vincent Kompany and experienced defender Pablo Zabaleta both pointed to City's previous Premier League triumphs to show why Manuel Pellegrini's men still believe they can claw back the deficit.

With City winning their first league game since New Year's Day by a convincing 4-1 margin at Stoke City this week, Zabaleta said: 'We are Manchester City and we never give up, simple as that. 'We have had that situation before, when we won the league in 2012. We were eight points beind United. 'Mourinho said the other day that seven points is different in this league because every game is like a final. We have 13 games to go to the end. We have belief in the team and if we play like we did at Stoke, we will have a great chance to catch them. We cannot afford to drop points though.' Kompany hailed the result at the Britannia Stadium – in which Sergio Aguero scored twice and gave his best performance since returning from a knee injury – as a potential turning point. He said: 'I guess we had to find our form and all of a sudden something has freed up. We started looking more like the team we are. 'It is a good feeling.

"Britain's most reviled female criminals are living in the same seaside town, it has been claimed. The mother of Baby P, Tracey Connelly, Maxine Carr – the former girlfriend of double child killer Ian Huntley – and kidnapper Karen Matthews are said to have homes close to each other in the resort. Although their location cannot be named for legal reasons, sightings of the notorious trio have already provoked comment on social networking sites. Scroll down for video . Maxine Carr (left), the ex-girlfriend of double murderer Ian Huntley and Tracey Connelly, the mother of 'Baby P', are both believed to be living in the same seaside town . Furious locals have complained that the town is being used as a ‘dumping ground’ for criminals. One wrote online: ‘What did we do to deserve them?’ Another resident said: ‘It’s incredible, even bizarre that they are all living here. Everyone is talking about it.’ The town dubbed the ‘monsters-by-the-sea resort’ has a ready supply of low-cost housing. It also has a high turnover of visitors and casual workers which should make it harder to identify ex-convicts. But this has not prevented residents from recognising their infamous faces. Carr, 38, who provided a false alibi to Huntley after he killed ten-year-old schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in 2002, has already been moved from one address because of the reaction of people living in the area. Her ex-boyfriend is still serving a minimum jail term of 40 years. Carr, who served 21 months in jail, was granted a lifetime anonymity order by the High Court ten years ago which bars the identification of her whereabouts or her new identity. She is one of only four offenders ever to get a new identity at the expense of the taxpayer. Following her release from prison in May 2004, she had dental work in an attempt to change her appearance. Karen Matthews, 39, who faked the kidnap of her own daughter to claim £50,000 reward money has also been seen in the seaside resort . Earlier this year she married her long-term boyfriend who is said to be ‘besotted’, despite knowing about her past. In October 2011 she gave birth to a son, who is unlikely to ever know his mother’s real identity due to the strict terms of the order. She is apparently working for ten hours a week in one of the resort’s shops. One person who claimed he was served by her told the Sunday People: ‘It suddenly clicked who she was. She is very distinctive.’ Also living in the town is Connelly, 33, who let her 17-month-old son Peter be tortured to death. She was released from prison a year ago after being jailed in 2009 and now lives in a two-bedroom flat. When she was granted parole, Connelly begged for an anonymity order, a flat near Blackpool’s seaside attractions and round-the-clock police protection, but ministers refused. Carr, 38, served 21 months in jail for providing Huntley with a false alibi after he murdered two schoolgirls . Huntley was given a double life sentence after he was convicted of the murder of Holly Wells (left) and Jessica Chapman (right) Maxine Ann Carr was sentenced to 21 months in prison in 2003 for perverting the course of justice. She provided Ian Huntley, who she was dating at the time, with a false alibi after he killed Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in 2002. Carr, was the girls' teaching assistant at St Andrew's Primary School, Soham, Cambridgeshire. Her failure to expose Huntley's lies in the early stages of the investigation meant that police initially eliminated him as a suspect. It took the police nearly two weeks to arrest and charge him. The court accepted that Carr had only lied to the police to protect Huntley because she believed his claims of innocence and so found her not guilty of assisting an offender. Instead she was given a grant of £750 to decorate and furnish a flat elsewhere, £400 a month housing benefit and jobseekers’ allowance. Last week the 24-stone junk food addict, who is still under the supervision of probation officers, was said to be unhappy after being recognised at a GP surgery in the resort. Karen Matthews, who was jailed for the kidnap of her nine-year-old daughter Shannon in a plot to pocket a £50,000 reward, is also said to have requested a seaside flat when she was freed in 2012. The 39-year-old mother of seven served four years in jail, and will remain on licence for the rest of her eight-year sentence. When she was released, she was given a makeover to prevent her being recognised. She lives under an assumed name and has signed on at the local Jobcentre. A resident on one of the resort’s estates where she apparently lives said: ‘She has put on so much weight that you can’t fail to notice her. I wouldn’t be surprised if she was 30 stone.’ Yesterday criminal justice expert Harry Fletcher said: ‘Normally offenders are dispersed. Certain seaside towns have disproportionate numbers living far from home to maintain their anonymity. But I have never heard of three high-profile offenders in the same area, it’s too risky. It’s extraordinary.’ A Ministry of Justice spokesman said yesterday: ‘We have some of the toughest measures in the world to manage serious offenders in the community and public protection is always our top priority.’ Peter, who was referred to as 'Baby P', was found dead in his blood-spattered after suffering 50 injuries . Matthews, 39, (left) faked the kidnap of her own daughter, Shannon, then nine, in 2008 and the search became a major missing person operation . Karen Matthews faked the kidnap of her  daughter Shannon, then nine, in 2008 to claim £50,000 reward money. She was sentenced to eight years in jail for child neglect, kidnapping, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice. The girl was found in a house which belonged to Michael Donovan, uncle of Craig Meehan - the boyfriend of the kidnapped girl's mother. Her disappearance sparked a major missing person operation and it was compared to the police search for Madeleine McCann . When she gave evidence she denied having anything to do with her daughter's disappearance, claiming that Craig Meehan told her to 'take the blame'. She said she did so because she was scared of him. Tracey Connelly was jailed for  five years in 2009 after admitting causing or allowing her son Peter's death. 'Baby P' died in August 2007 with more than 50 injuries, despite being on a social services ""at-risk"" register. His death at home in Tottenham, north London, came a day after police told his mother she would not be prosecuted over abuse of the 17-month-old. Social workers, health professionals and police officers had visited 60 times in eight months. Connelly's boyfriend Steven Barker, and his brother Jason Owen were all convicted of causing or allowing the death of a child. Peter, who was 17-months-old, was found dead in his blood-spattered cot at Connelly's flat with a broken back.

Lynda died aged 66 in the arms of her husband, Michael, in a London hospital on Sunday, just days after she announced her plans to end chemotherapy for the colon cancer which had spread to lungs and liver. She said she wanted to take back control of her life and spare her family the pain of seeing the gruelling treatment take its toll on her. She said two weeks ago: 'I want my husband and children to see me off happy, contented. So I put the chemotherapy in a box. 'In this box, I could stop the chemotherapy after Christmas - I'm determined to hang on until Christmas.

"One of the last iconic remnants of 'old' Heathrow is being demolished this week. The distinctive nine-floor red brick old control tower is being pulled down as part of the airport's transformation. It is being removed to make way for roads which will serve the new Terminal 2. Served its time: The original control tower at Heathrow is pulled down . End of an era: The demolition of the distinctive nine-floor red brick old control tower is the latest phase of the £2.5billion refurbishment . of Terminal 2 . The iconic structure, with its instantly recognisable glazed Air Traffic Control Room and white radar dome, has stood over the ever-evolving airport since 1955.

"Active: Thousands of people's lives could be saved by more walking . Walking for 20 minutes a day could save 37,000 people a year from dying prematurely of cancer, heart disease and stroke, according to a report. But one in three people can barely manage to walk for 30 minutes a week – including everyday trips to the shops, work or school. Just under half of those surveyed walk for two hours or less a week – far below Government guidelines of 150 minutes a week, or 21 minutes a day. Only one in 20 people in England does enough moderate physical activity such as walking to get the health benefits, says the report from The Ramblers walking charity and Macmillan Cancer Support. It reviews research into the life-threatening consequences of inactivity, ranging from early death to a greater risk of serious diseases. The report Walking Works found if everyone in England did enough walking to meet recommended guidelines each year it could prevent 36,815 people dying prematurely, 294,730 cases of diabetes and save 12,061 people going to hospital for emergency treatment of coronary heart disease. Research suggests being inactive can take three to five years off your life and increase the chances of developing cancer, heart disease or having a stroke by 25-50 per cent. A lack of physical activity is to blame for 17 per cent of early deaths in the UK, says the report, costing the economy up to £10billion a year through sick days, care costs and early deaths. Opinion polls reveal nine out of ten Britons think walking is a good form of exercise that can keep you healthy. But a third of people are very inactive, saying they do less than 30 minutes of exercise a week – and objective testing shows the figure is probably higher, with more than half failing to exercise. Only 6 per cent of men and four per cent of women manage 150 minutes of physical activity a week in England. Nearly everyone could step up their walking, says the report, with only 4 per cent of people not able to walk or needing help to do so. Dr William Bird, founder of Walking for Health and Intelligent Health, which promotes exercise schemes, said lack of physical activity is a more significant source of ill-health and premature death than obesity. He said: ‘You can be fat and fit, but you can’t be healthy if you’re inactive and thin. Britain has one of the most inactive populations in the world. 'The USA eats more but as a nation they move around more, despite the car culture, because they understand how much it matters.’ He said the NHS should change its approach so every contact with patients, from GPs to consultants, stressed that exercise was vital to health. ‘You don’t have to do it all in one go – just ten minutes extra walking a day could save your life,’ he added. Ciaran Devane, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘ For cancer patients, being active can help manage some of the debilitating consequences of treatment and can even help reduce the chance of some cancers returning. ‘Inactivity is a nationwide epidemic that must be tackled now before it is too late. ‘Healthcare professionals need to ensure that they prescribe physical activity, such as walking, as an intrinsic part of a healthy lifestyle.’ Dr Bird said walking improves health by boosting natural killer cells, curbing inflammation and preventing damage to the ‘energy battery’ in cells.","Survey from The Ramblers and Mamillan Cancer Support exercise could save lives .

"A jury took less than half an hour to find a woman guilty of lying to police about being raped by her ex-boyfriend in a bid to cover up a threesome she had with two men she met in a pub. Lisa Yapp, 24, showed the men naked photographs of herself then went to one of their homes where they had sex in the kitchen, a court heard. The court was told she high-fived the men afterwards but later turned up on the doorstep of a friend in tears claiming she had been raped. Lisa Yapp was convicted at Worcester Crown Court yesterday when a jury returned a unanimous guilty verdict after 29 minutes of deliberation . The single mother-of-one told the friend she had been attacked by her former partner Gavin Hockey, 30, in an alleyway on July 31, 2011. Police launched a major investigation after she told them her attacker 'sounded and felt' like her ex-boyfriend. But it later emerged Mr Hockey had an alibi and could be seen on CCTV on a night out with friends 30 miles away in his hometown of Hereford. Yapp, from Ronkswood, Worcester, was arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice by making a false statement and went on trial last week. She was convicted at Worcester Crown Court yesterday when a jury returned a unanimous guilty verdict after 29 minutes of deliberation. The court heard Yapp got talking to friends Matthew Stevens, 39, and Terry Lippett in the Goodrest Tavern, in Worcester in the summer of 2011. Yapp, pictured with an unidentified man, went to a friend's house claiming she'd been raped, the court heard . During the seven-day trial, the jury heard the trio returned to Mr Stevens’ home around the corner from the pub after the talk became 'sexual'. When they arrived, the court heard, Yapp showed them more photographs in the kitchen before stripping off and telling them she had been involved in orgies in the past. Mr Stevens told the jury he had sexual intercourse with Yapp while Mr Lippett said he 'groped' her while the pair were having sex. He told the court: 'I was a bit shocked. Afterwards I thought ""that was a bit mad, I can’t believe what just happened"". 'I was a bit embarrassed to be honest.' Police launched a major investigation after Yapp told them her attacker 'sounded and felt' like her ex-boyfriend . The court heard Yapp and her friend called police to report she had been raped in an alleyway near her home in Worcester. In a recorded police interview played to the court, she told officers: 'I knew someone was walking behind me and I started walking a bit faster. 'I felt his fist hit the back of my head and he pushed my back down. He grabbed hold of my hair and with his other hand he pulled my trousers down.' She added that she had screamed and tried to fight back as her attacker raped her before pinning her to the floor shouting 'I told you I’d get you for it'. Yapp also revealed she had previously made allegations of rape against Mr Hockey, which had been dropped, and believed the attack was revenge. But a police investigation revealed Mr Hockey had been out with friends in Hereford and a medical examination found no evidence that Yapp had been attacked. CCTV from the pub and friend’s accounts showed she had left the pub with two older men in the opposite direction to the alleyway. After being arrested, Yapp changed her story and claimed to police that she suffered from blackouts - but still maintained she had been raped. Prosecutor Andrew Wilkins said: 'Why she lied we might never know, it might be because she felt guilty. 'It might be that she was trying to pre-empt any effects of the sex she had had - pregnancy, or disease perhaps - by making these allegations sooner rather than later. 'It might be that she wanted to get back at her former boyfriend. We will never know.' During the trial it also emerged Yapp had a history for lying after another of her ex-partners Darren Edwards, 26, told the jury she would often tell 'major' lies. Giving evidence he said when she called him to tell him she had been attacked, his first thought was: 'Oh, here we go again.' He also revealed their first relationship broke down because of her lies but they got back together when she led him to believe her son was his. A DNA test later proved Mr Edwards was not the father and he told the court. The court also heard Yapp had previously made an allegation of sex abuse against her step-father when she was just 13. But she later admitted she had lied, and said she had made the complaint to get more affection from her family. Yapp was bailed and ordered to return to the court to be sentenced next month.","Jury took 29 minutes to find Lisa Yapp guilty of lying about being raped .

"President Bush has been criticized for making poor speeches, but according to a new survey, Obama's address to the American people is only slightly more sophisticated. Vocativ calculated data on 600 presidential speeches from George Washington on using a reading comprehension algorithm called the Flesh-Kincaid readability test. The algorithm measures each speech's word count, sentence length, and word syllables and then assigns a numerical grade parallel with educational level. Comprable: Obama's speeches measure only slightly more sophisticated than former president George Bush who was criticized for making poor public addresses to the nation . Data: Bush (red) and Obama (blue were graded similarly numerically in trms of speech sophistication . Vocativ reports that a number grade four indicates that the speech could be understood by a fourth-grader. A number 12 means the speech would be understood by a college graduate and a grade of 21 or higher is comprehensible by people who have achieved a PHD. After calculating the data Vocativ reached five conclusions which a former speech writer for Bill Clinton by the name of Jeff Shesol analysed. Speeches made by Obama and Bush were numerically graded somewhere between 7 and 11 and both of their speeches ranked similarly. 'I don't see a huge discrepancy here. I think President Obama, no more or less than President Bush, tries to pack a lot of nuance and subtext into language that is as plain and straightforward as possible. While President Bush was often inarticulate off the cuff, Bush's speeches were underestimated. There was a crisp formality to a lot of his best speeches, particularly the ones he delivered shortly after Sept. 11,' said Shesol after looking at the numbers. Long winded: Over time speeches have gotten longer and longer and presidents like Bill Clinton have been criticized for making lengthy State of the Union addresses . Longer: Over the years, presidential speeches have gotten longer and longer from the 1700s until now . The study also finds that speeches have become less sophisticated over time because at first presidents were merely speaking to men similar to themselves in education and in status sin life. 'It's tempting to read this as a dumbing down of the bully pulpit,' Shesol says. 'But it’s actually a sign of democratization. In the early Republic, presidents could assume that they were speaking to audiences made up mostly of men like themselves: educated, civic-minded landowners. These, of course, were the only Americans with the right to vote. But over time, the franchise expanded and presidential appeals had to reach a broader audience.' Not only have speeches gotten less sophisticated they have also gotten longer. President Clinton was one modern president who would get criticism for writing lengthy State of the Union addresses. Most variance: Lincoln made speeches with varying degrees of sophistication but his Gettysburg Address was so well received the John F. Kennedy's spech writer looked to it as a reference. 'One would assume that our decreasing attention span has led to shorter and shorter speeches. I believe that no one, not even a president, ought to give a speech that's longer than 20 minutes. President Clinton used to get tremendous grief from commentators about the length of his State of the Union addresses. But our polling showed that the public liked the long speeches—and people actually stayed tuned. But very few speakers are as compelling as Bill Clinton,' said former speechwriter Shesol. The study finds that when presidents like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington made speeches to Native Americans that they simplified their language. Though, Shesol says that this type of variation is rarely seen today. 'If Washington and Jefferson simplified their language when speaking to Native Americans, they must have seen some kind of gap, either in language or in shared cultural understanding (or both), between themselves and their audience. Presidents today certainly modify their language when speaking to different groups—when speaking in Little Rock, Arkansas, President Clinton would often roll out Southern expressions that you'd never hear him use in a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations. But when a live microphone or camera is in front of them, presidents are really speaking to everyone at once. So I don't imagine you'd see this degree of variation today,' says Shesol. The data shows that Abraham Lincoln's speeches ranged in numerical grade from seven to 21. Lincoln’s Gettysburg address was so inspirational that that both John F. Kennedy and his speechwriter would refer to it for inspiration. According to the speechwriter, one syllable words as oppose to three syllable words make the speech more effective.","A study calculated 600 presidential speeches from George Washington on using a reading comprehension algorithm called the Flesh-Kincaid readability test .

Senior figures within the Rangers dressing room believe the caretaker boss will be handed the role. The move to install Ramsey is yet to be finalised but the club are moving in that direction. Chris Ramsey is now the leading candidate to take the QPR manager's job until the end of the season . Ramsey and Kevin Bond took charge for the 2-0 defeat of Sunderland in their previous outing . The QPR players have been impressed with the quality of Ramsey's training sessions . Sportsmail revealed on Wednesday that Ramsey had significant backing from senior QPR players. Chairman Tony Fernandes is due to jet in to London next week and he will be greeted by glowing references from players, who would now like to see Ramsey - alongside coach Kevin Bond - put in permanent control until at least the end of the season. Players have been thoroughly impressed by Ramsey's coaching sessions since he assumed control of first team matters last Tuesday. The quality of his coaching has been compared to that of Steve McClaren - who is widely recognised as one of England's best coaches. McClaren spent a spell at Loftus Road under Redknapp last season. Whether a team of Ramsey and Bond - with Les Ferdinand as director of football - is the 'dream' appointment Fernandes alluded to on Twitter remains to be seen.

"Former Liverpool striker Sebastian Leto has been taken to hospital for emergency treatment after a barbell fell on his head during training. Now at Italian side Catania, Leto suffered the injury after a squat exercise in the gym which saw a barbell drop on his head. The 28-year-old, who has been on loan at Argentinian club Lanus since February 3, was initially sent home by the medical staff with a deep wound in his head. Sebastian Leto (right), pictured in action for Catania last year, is in intensive care after barbell fell on his head . Leto is challenged by Reading striker Shane Long during a League Cup clash with Liverpool in 2007 . But he later went to the hospital after suffering headaches and is now in intensive care. Doctors are not ruling out surgery for the 28-year-old and it is feared Leto may have internal hemorrhaging. Leto was signed by Rafa Benitez from Lanus in 2007 and made 15 appearances for the Reds before leaving for Olympiacos on loan in 2008. He left Anfield permanently a year later when he signed for Greek side Panathinaikos before moving on to Catania in the summer of 2013.

"Ryder Cup star Thomas Bjorn is pleased to be out on the course again after a couple of weeks struggling to get out of bed with a back problem. The Dane's solitary appearance this year came at the Dubai Desert Classic, where he missed the cut earlier this month, but he feels in better shape as he tees it up at the True Thailand Classic, a new event on the European Tour.

"It is an exclusive address that only a handful of people would be rich enough to be able to afford. But that still hasn't stopped a Saudi prince swearing would-be buyers to secrecy if they decide to purchase the luxurious Kensington home in the heart of London. Prince Abdul Aziz bin Fahd is attempting to sell one of Britain's priciest homes, which is located at the bottom of Kensington Palace Gardens - itself dubbed 'Billionaire's Row' as it is one of Britain's most expensive streets. A home fit for a prince: Saudi prince Abdul Aziz bin Fahd was reported to be selling his luxury London mansion in Kensington Palace Gardens - known as Billionaire's Row - which is estimated to be worth £150million . Very few of these ambassadorial-type houses come onto the market and they attract global attention on the rare occasions they are made available. Because of the expected international media interest, estate agent Knight Frank is understood to have approached potential buyers and asked them to sign confidentiality agreements, The Times reported. Secret sale: Price Abdul Aziz bin Fahd was last year selling his home in Kensington Palace Gardens . The Prince's detached, three-storey . property in Palace Green, is one of many luxurious homes that make up . the exclusive area in West London. In fact, the homes in Kensington Palace Gardens would be too pricey even for many celebrities, bankers and lottery winners. A string of eye-watering property deals has helped to turn the tree-lined  half a mile long avenue into Britain’s most expensive street. The average price of a mansion in the affluent road in Kensington, West London, is an astonishing £19.2million, according to a study by property company Zoopla. That equates to around 93 times the national average house price of around £210, 000. Even a single square foot of land in the street would cost you £1,193. It is estimated that the Saudi royal . family owns at least ten of the properties on the street between them - . with the mansion up for sale believed to be worth £150million alone. Other . residents are said to include the Sultan of Brunei, the steel magnate . Lakshmi Mittal and the founder of Foxtons estate agents, Jon Hunt. Both ends of the street are manned by . armed Diplomatic Protection Group officers because it houses several . embassies, including those of Israel and Russia. The . street’s allure is helped by Kensington Palace, set back from the road . on the eastern side, where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are . currently staying with newborn Prince George. Billionaire's row: The privately-guarded road by Hyde Park is one of the most exclusive streets in Britain . Living in luxury: Large mansions along Billionaire's Row - where the average house price is £19.2million - can be seen at the end of Kensington Palace Gardens in London . The Prince is not the only resident believed to currently be considering selling up their property in Kensington Palace Gardens. It was reported in April that the Nepalese embassy plans to sell its property on the famous street. The mansion, built in 1865, was gifted . to the Nepalese in 1937 as a thank you for the heroic help from the . Gurkhas to the British armed forces. Soldiers regard the Victorian Villa . as a priceless part of their history. They . pay a nominal £1,000 a year rent on the crown lease, but the mansion - . which has remained untouched for half a century - requires more than . £5million in essential repairs. The rundown property, which backs onto Palace Green, has been described as a 'national embarrassment' in its current condition. Exclusive: A 12-bedroom mansion on Kensington Palace Gardens which was bought by Britain multi-billionaire steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal . Embassy street: The Russian Ambassador's official residenence on Kensington Palace Gardens . Heritage: The exclusive No 12A Kensington Palace Gardens was given to Nepal in 1937 as a thank you for the work of their Gurkhas in the British armed forces . Toilets don't flush, the roof needs . repairs and visa applicants are greeted by the sound of pressure cooker . whistles from upstairs. But . despite the 32,000 square foot property's dilapidated state, there is . likely to be a bidding war the moment the property is officially made . available. It is not known whether the Nepalese Government has decided to go ahead with the sale. Desirable location: The luxury property is located in the heart of the London . Trevor Abrahmsohn, from Glentree Estates, who sold Bernie Ecclestone's house on Kensington Palace Gardens to Lakshmi Mittal in 2004 has previously said the road is one of the best protected in the UK. He said: 'With all the embassies in the road, security is probably higher than any other private road in the UK. This is why it is so sought after amongst oligarchs who crave their privacy and protection. 'The mansions in the road are surrounded with sizeable gardens and that is unique in central London. 'Of course, once you exit this road you are literally in the centre of London. 'Since there are very few properties in this road available at any time, of the few people able to afford it, there could certainly be a bidding war.' Research by Knight Frank, the upmarket . estate agency, shows about half of the homes bought in central London . for more than £1million are acquired by foreigners from countries such . as Russia, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, France, . Singapore and India.

"For many hay fever sufferers, spring can be a mixed blessing. With the benefits of longer days and warmer weather comes the misery of endless sneezing. And the bad news for hay fever sufferers is that this year is going to be particularly bad. Dr Jean Emberlin predicts that by 2060, between up to 70 per cent of people in England will have hay fever. Maps show (left to right) how the proportion of people with hay fever is expected to increase by 2009, 2020, 2040, 2060 . According to experts, the birch pollen hay fever season will start much earlier than usual this year. And over the next 50 years, the number of hay fever sufferers may double, they say. Dr Jean Emberlin, Director of Pollen UK, predicts that this year the birch pollen hay fever season will hit the UK by the end of March. She said: ‘This year’s birch pollen season is expected to start three to four weeks earlier than 2013 and is set to be a high pollen production year, with high or very high pollen counts occurring on warm, dry days with some wind. ‘Current indications for 2014 suggest that the birch season will start abruptly in the South and Midlands between March 25 and 28, but some sufferers may be in for an earlier hay fever hit as temperatures continue to rise. ‘There will be a short lag time of about two weeks when it will reach Scotland mid-April. Pollen count is highest in central and south eastern England. It is much lower in Scotland and Wales . ‘The South and Midlands will be the . worst affected areas and the season is likely to last for approximately . four weeks in each location. ‘Last year, the birch pollen season started nearly a month later around April 24, across the South and the Midlands and the season was below average severity across the season overall.’ Dr Emberlin says that Britain currently has one of the highest rates of hay fever in the world with about 25 per cent of the population suffering. She added that the number of sufferers is likely to more than double to 32 million by 2030. Speaking on behalf of Opticrom Hay Fever Eye Drops, she explained: ‘Climate change in the next few decades will have a notable impact on people’s health, especially for hay fever sufferers. It is thought that this year the UK birch pollen season will start three to four weeks earlier than normal. Image shows a pollen calendar for the UK . ‘This will have important consequences for the individual sufferer in the form of economic and social costs, together with decreased quality of life and exam performance. ‘The costs of absences from work and decreased productivity, together with the costs of remedies and GP consultations are estimated to be about £7 billion a year in the UK. ‘There is a high probability that climate changes over the next few decades will bring longer and more severe pollen and spore seasons which will, in turn, increase these financial and social costs significantly.’ Dr Emberlin said: 'This year's birch pollen season is expected to start three to four weeks earlier than 2013 and is set to be a high pollen production year, with high or very high pollen counts' However, it is not all bad news as Dr Emberlin says there are things people can do to reduce their symptoms. She says it can be helpful to avoid going outside when the pollen count is high - normally from early to mid-morning - and to avoid cutting the grass. She says people can also benefit from wearing wraparound sunglasses to keep the pollen out of their eyes and to avoid drying laundry outside when the pollen count is high.","The season is expected to start three to four weeks early this year .
It is predicted to hit southern England between March 25 and 28 .

"Bernard Hopkins has launched a withering attack on Carl Froch by branding the English Super Middleweight boxer a 'coward' for avoiding a potential world title showdown. Hopkins has hit back at Froch after the Nottingham fighter suggested a title bout against the 50-year-old American would be a 'lose-lose situation'. Froch was hoping to face Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in Las Vegas but he had to scupper plans of a mega fight against the Mexican due to an elbow injury. Bernard Hopkins has responded to Carl Froch's recent comments regarding a potential fight . Froch, pictured on the left during his fight against George Groves, is not keen on a fight with Hopkins . The postponement led to talk of a potential fight against Hopkins until Froch ruled out the possibility. Hopkins, speaking to Sky Sports, said: 'You should put all the pressure on that coward that calls himself one of the greatest European fighters of all time. 'That is not true, that’s an insult to Joe Calzaghe, and let me tell you something - that's an insult to any great fighter that has come out of the UK from the past and the present. 'To hear a guy make excuses for a legitimate force that he knows he will lose against and possibly lose his career, like many other fighters did when they stepped in the ring with ""The Alien"". ' Hopkins (left) lost his last fight to Russian boxer Sergey Kovalev in November 2014 . Hopkins added he was happy for Froch to dictate where the potential fight would take place. He said: 'If he wants to fight before he retires as he was quoted: ""I want to fight in Vegas"". 'Well, I haven’t fought in Vegas in multiple years. We can do it in Vegas, let's get our people together and talk. Or we can fight in the UK. He thought that was going to be something that was going to be a snag.

They are from the archive of newsreel company British Pathe, which has published a gallery of images to coincide with the opening of the first part of the network back in 1863. The photos show the Queen opening the Victoria Line in 1969 and taking the controls of a train at Green Park, the closest stop to her Buckingham Palace home. The newsreel narrator says: 'Her Majesty inspected the automatic controls of one of the line’s 34 silver trains, then pressed the buttons which sent the loco in motion. That’s all the driver has to do. Computers do the rest. 'The Queen stayed at the controls for the short journey between Green Park and Oxford Circus.' Her Majesty was also seen in the video relaxing in one of the trains carriages, using one of the station's escalators and inspecting new ticket machines. It was the Queen's second trip underground, the first had come in 1939 when she was 13 with her governess Marion Crawford and Princess Margaret. It would not be the last time that The Queen would ride in the driver's cab of an Underground train. Although not at the controls this time, she rode at the front of a train again in 1977 as she opened up part of an extension to the Picadilly Line and travelled between Hatton Cross and Heathrow on the train. Her most recent trip underground was a visit to Aldgate station in 2010, to view a plaque in honour of those killed in the July 7 bombings in 2005.

"Diego Costa has defended his fighting mentality as the Chelsea striker gets set to make his return after serving a ban for stamping on Emre Can. Costa was slapped with the three-match ban for violent conduct during the Capital One Cup semi-final win against Liverpool last month. The Spanish international will return to the Chelsea squad for the Champions League last-16 clash against PSG next week - and it looks as if there will be no change to his strong approach.

Costa scores Chelsea's second goal in their 5-0 victory over Swansea at the Liberty Stadium . Costa appears to stamp on Emre Can's right leg during the Capital One Cup semi-final against Liverpool . The front cover of Sport Magazine, which features an interview with Chelsea striker Costa . Costa told Sport Magazine: 'If you check my records, you will find out that I’ve never caused a bad injury to any player. The bottom line is that sometimes the little things I do on the pitch provoke exaggerated reactions. 'But if you rewind a bit and go through what they did to me, you may have another point of view. 'I consider myself a player who fights and gives everything on the pitch. Those who know me and appreciate those values understand what I say.' In turn, Costa feels that he has had to make adjustments to deal with the treatment coming his way in English football. Costa said: 'I am getting used to getting kicked more than before. Premier League defenders are really strong and physical. 'In England, the referees don’t call many fouls, as opposed to Spanish football. Consequently, you must be really strong all through the 90 minutes. 'Some of the kicks I suffer in England would be punished with a red card in Spain. My challenges on the ball are strong but noble at the same time.' Costa and Can clash after the incident, which occurred close to Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho . Costa sits behind the bench during the Premier League match between Chelsea and Everton on Wednesday . Costa (right) celebrates after the final whistle as Chelsea beat Everton 1-0 in a feisty encounter . Costa has made quite an impact in England, scoring 17 goals in 19 Premier League matches since his arrival from Atletico Madrid last summer. And he paid tribute to manager Mourinho, saying he has learnt ‘many things’ from the Blues boss. Costa said: 'We all know that he’s among the best managers in the world. When you arrive in a team with a manager like him, you try to spot every single thing you can learn from him. 'Every manager has a different way of reading the game. In regards to Jose Mourinho, he is a clever manager who spots very well the opponent’s virtues and weaknesses. Our training sessions are based on that.'

"From a human ear, to perfectly functioning valves, 3D printers are already being used in medicine, but now scientists in the U.S. are attempting to build a whole human heart using the versatile piece of kit. Their ultimate goal is to create a new heart for a patient using their own cells that could be transplanted. It is an ambitious project to first make a heart and then get it to work in a patient and it could be years - perhaps decades - before a 3D printed heart would be put in a person in a standard operating theatre. Learning by heart: Scientists could create a new heart for a patient using a 3D printer and their own cells. The organ could be created in just three to five years time and be transplanted in a human within the next decade. The printing of 'ventricle cyclinders' is pictured . The ultimate goal is to create a new heart for a patient using their own cells that could be transplanted. The finished product would be called the ‘bioficial heart’ - a blend of the natural and artificial. The heart may be built from cells taken from the patient's fat. But plenty of difficulties remain, including understanding how to keep manufactured tissue alive after it is printed. Patients in the operating theatre would have some fat tissue removed and regenerative cells isolated. The cells would then be mixed with solutions and placed in the bioprinter, which prints the heart. The new organ would then be transplanted in another operation. The technology, though, is not all that futuristic. Researchers have already used 3D printers to make splints, valves and even a human ear. So far, the University of Louisville in Kentucky has printed human heart valves and small veins with cells, said Stuart Williams, a cell biologist leading the ambitious project. They have also successfully tested the tiny blood vessels in mice and other small animals and Professor Williams believes scientists will be able to print parts and assemble an entire heart in three to five years. The finished product would be called the ‘bioficial heart’ - a blend of the natural and artificial. The biggest challenge is to get the cells to work together as they do in a normal heart, said Professor Williams, who heads the project at the Cardiovascular Innovation Institute, which is a partnership between the university and Jewish Hospital in Louisville. A tricky operation: An organ built from a patient's cells could solve the rejection problem some patients have with donor organs. If everything goes according to plan, Professor Williams says the heart might be tested in humans in less than a decade. An image of open heart surgery is pictured . 3D printing is already being used in medicine. Researchers have used the technology to make splints, valves and even a human ear. So far, the University of Louisville in Kentucky has printed human heart valves and small veins with cells. The team has also successfully tested the tiny blood vessels in mice and other small animals. Professor Williams, of the Cardiovascular Innovation Institute, believes scientists will be able to print parts and assemble an entire heart in three to five years. The 3D printer uses a mixture of a gel and living cells to gradually build the shape of a blood vessel – and one day a heart. The idea is that eventually, the cells would grow together to form the tissue. In the future it could take just three hours to print the whole structure of the heart. An organ built from a patient's cells could solve the rejection problem some patients have with donor organs or an artificial heart and it could eliminate the need for anti-rejection drugs, he said. If everything goes according to plan, Professor Williams believes the heart could be tested in humans in less than a decade. The first patients would most likely be those with failing hearts who are not candidates for artificial ones, including children whose chests are too small for an artificial organ. Professor Williams said the heart he envisaged would be built from cells taken from the patient's fat. But plenty of difficulties remain, including understanding how to keep manufactured tissue alive after it is printed. Dr Anthony Atala, whose team at Wake Forest University in North Carolina is using 3D printers to attempt to make a human kidney, said: ‘With complex organs such as the kidney and heart, a major challenge is being able to provide the structure with enough oxygen to survive until it can integrate with the body’. The 3D printing approach is not the only strategy researchers are investigating to build a heart out of a patient's own cells. Elsewhere, scientists are exploring the idea of putting the cells into a mould. Scientists have already created rodent hearts that beat in the laboratory and some simple body parts made using this method have already been implanted in people, including bladders and windpipes. Mending hearts: Professor Williams said that the heart (a model is pictured) is the easiest organ to print because it is made up of so few cells and only has one major function - to contract or beat . The 3D printer works in much the same way an inkjet printer does, with a needle that squirts material in a predetermined pattern. The cells would be purified in a machine and then printing would begin in sections, using a computer model to build the heart layer by layer. Professor Williams' printer uses a mixture of a gel and living cells to gradually build the shape. The idea is that eventually, the cells would grow together to form the tissue. At the moment, the printer is focused on replicating parts of the heart, but in the future it could print the whole structure in less than three hours, Professor Williams told Wired. However, the largest blood vessels and valves will need to be printed and assembled separately. ‘Final construction will then be achieved by bioprinting and strategic placement of the valves and big vessels, he added. The technology has already helped in other areas of medicine, including creating sure-fitting prosthetics and a splint that was printed to keep a sick child's airway open. Doctors at Cornell University used a 3D printer last year to create an ear with living cells.","Scientists from the Cardiovascular Innovation Institute in Louisville, Kentucky, are able to print parts of hearts including blood vessels .

"It is something that will surely come as a surprise to few of us. People who live or work near takeaways eat more junk food and are almost twice as likely to be obese as those who have none on their doorstep, a study has found. Consumers who are the most tempted by takeaways and fast food eat an extra 40g of high calorie food - the same as half a small serving of McDonald’s fries - every week compared to those who stay away. Warning: People who live or work near takeaways eat more junk food and are almost twice as likely to be obese . Working near a fast food place or takeaway caused the biggest problems, closely followed by them being located near the home. The research, published online in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), is the first UK study to combine data from home, work and commuting and involved 5,442 adults from Cambridgeshire aged 29 to 62. On average, people were exposed to 32 takeaway outlets - nine each in their local neighbourhood and on their commute, and 14 within a mile of work. There were around 48 per cent more takeaway outlets and fast food joints near work compared to home, the study found. Researchers examined how much takeaway food people ate using questionnaires for foods such as pizza, burgers, fried food (such as fried chicken) and chips. They also measured people’s body mass index (BMI) as a measure of their weight. The results showed that people exposed to the highest number of takeaways were 80 per cent more likely to be obese and 20 per cent more likely to have a higher BMI than those with the lowest number of encounters. They also ate more of these types of foods. The researchers said: 'Compared with . people least exposed to takeaway food outlets, we estimate those most . exposed consumed an additional 5.7g per day of takeaway food, which . would constitute a 15 per cent higher consumption than those least . exposed. Those most tempted by takeaways and fast food eat an extra 40g of high calorie food - the same as half a small serving of McDonald's fries - every week . 'In a week, this translates into an additional 39.9g of takeaway food. This weekly amount constitutes more than half a small serving of McDonald’s french fries (typically 71g per serving).' Over the past decade, consumption of . food outside the home has increased by 29 per cent, while at the same time, the . number of takeaway food outlets has increased dramatically, the . researchers said. This, they argued, could be contributing to rising . levels of overweight and obesity. Dr Thomas Burgoine, lead author of the study from the UK’s centre for diet and activity research, based in the Medical Research Council’s epidemiology unit at the University of Cambridge, said: “The foods we eat away from home tend to be less healthy than the meals we prepare ourselves. 'Therefore it is important to consider how exposure to food outlets selling these high calorie foods in our day-to-day environments might be influencing consumption. 'Our study provides new evidence that there is some kind of relationship between the number of takeaway food outlets we encounter, our consumption of these foods, and how much we weigh. 'Of course this is likely to be just one of a number of factors that contribute to a person’s risk of developing obesity. 'However, our findings do suggest that taking steps to restrict takeaway outlets in our towns and cities, particularly around workplaces, may be one way of positively influencing our diet and health.' Professor Jill Pell, chairwoman of the Medical Research Council’s population health sciences group, added: 'To date, studies examining the link between the neighbourhood food environment and diet and body weight have provided mixed results, which is why it’s important that we continue to study these relationships. Over the past decade, consumption of food outside the home has increased by 29 per cent - and this has been linked to obesity . 'In future, this type of research will provide the robust evidence needed to develop effective strategies to tackle obesity and promote a healthier lifestyle.' Tracy Parker, heart health dietitian at the British Heart Foundation (BHF), which helped fund the study, said: 'We already know that people are spending more than ever on takeaways and food eaten away from home, and that these foods are often less healthy than the meals we make ourselves. 'This is a worrying trend given that a quarter of adults in the UK are already obese, putting them at greater risk of heart disease. 'While this study can’t prove someone’s local environment can cause them to become obese, it’s vital we have the tools to make healthy choices when eating takeaways or food in a restaurant. 'Clearly signposting healthy meal options, providing clear nutritional information, and offering appropriate portion sizes can help this.'","Those most tempted by fast food eat extra 40g of high calorie food a week .

"Online attack: Connor Brown accused the victim of being a 'money grabbing little tramp' A teammate of the footballer jailed last week for raping a teenager has been suspended by his club after he branded the victim a 'money grabbing little tramp'. Soon after Sheffield United striker Ched Evans was convicted, reserve player Connor Brown posted Twitter messages about the case, including a personal attack on the woman. The club said it has launched an investigation into the 19-year-old's social network posts, which were passed on to North Wales Police by a leading rape charity. A club statement read: 'Sheffield United Football Club have suspended reserve team player Connor Brown with immediate effect pending an internal investigation into comments apparently posted on his personal Twitter account. 'There will be no further comment from the club during the process of the investigation which it hopes to conclude swiftly.' The suspension follows a storm that erupted as the victim was named on the social networking website. Police promised a ‘robust’ investigation after the girl was identified and abused on the internet within hours of Wales international Evans being found guilty of the attack. Her name was being circulated so widely that it is understood to have been one of the top ‘trending’, or most used, words on the Twitter site over the weekend. The victim was last night said by her family to have been ‘traumatised’ by the loss of her anonymity and the Attorney General has warned that those who published her name could face prosecution. Standing by her man: Ched Evans, left, is being supported by his girlfriend Natasha Massey, 24, despite him being convicted of raping a teenager . Sheffield United player Evans, 23, was sentenced to five years in jail on Friday for raping the 19-year-old in a hotel after a night out in Rhyl, North Wales last May. He admitted having sex with the victim but she told police she had no memory of the incident and believed her drinks had been spiked. Evans’s friend, the Port Vale defender Clayton McDonald, 23, also admitted having sex with the victim but was found not guilty of the same charge. Despite his conviction he was this week named in the Professional Footballer Association League One Team of the Year. Organisers defended the decision to include him in the award as a 'footballing judgement' and not a moral one. Soon after Evans was convicted, his teammate Brown took to Twitter to post comments about the case and the victim. Trial: The victim's name was circulated within hours of the jury returning its verdict. Clayton McDonald, 23, left, was cleared of rape while Ched Evans, right, was convicted of rape and sentenced to five years in jail . A number of supporters joined in, with one writing: ‘Birds that **** footballers then accuse them of rape are complete compensation-grabbing ***s. They need shooting.’ Personal abuse against the victim on the internet soon escalated into messages in which she was named. Jonathan Cox from Sheffield published her name, saying she ‘isn’t a victim she’s a whore’. Joshua Laughton, also from Sheffield, tweeted the name of the victim before sharing another user’s message saying ‘she’s got a massive reputation in Rhyl for doing similar things’. Both Cox and Laughton have since removed their messages from Twitter. Rape victims are granted lifelong anonymity by the courts and publishing a name is a criminal offence punishable by a fine of up to £5,000. North Wales Police have described the comments on Twitter as ‘profoundly disturbing’ and say they contribute to the young woman’s ‘continued trauma’.Last night her family revealed she was ‘traumatised, shocked and deeply upset’ at being identified by Twitter users. Tirade: Connor Brown took to his Twitter to comment on the verdict and the victim . The most high-profile leak on Twitter was the naming of footballer Ryan Giggs as he tried to protect his identity. Giggs, 38, took out an injunction last April to prevent the media from reporting allegations that he had an extra-marital affair with former Big Brother contestant Imogen Thomas and allegations that she had blackmailed him. The Manchester United star was the subject of so much speculation on Twitter that eventually Lib Dem MP John Hemming 'outed' him in the House of Commons. Her mother said: ‘Putting her name  on Twitter is just another horrendous ordeal for her and we have been assured the police are going to come down like a ton of bricks on these people.’ The teenager is understood to have had counselling following the rape. Evans has been the top scorer for Sheffield United this season, scoring 29 League goals, and he was named in the Professional Footballers’ Association League One team of the year on Sunday. Voting took place before his conviction. The sister of the victim believes she has been abused because of Evans’s popularity as a footballer. She said: ‘People are only doing it because he is a footballer, I think it is absolutely disgusting and the whole family are shocked.’ While newspapers and television broadcasters follow court anonymity rulings, they are often ignored on the internet and postings are usually difficult to remove once they have been published. Labour MP Louise Ellman said: ‘The naming of any rape victim should be condemned, anonymity is crucial and this case should be pursued by the authorities.’ North Wales Police have begun collecting evidence. Detective Chief Inspector Steve Williams said: ‘As and when criminal offences are identified on such websites they will be dealt with robustly and the offenders will be brought to justice.’ A spokesman for the Attorney General’s Office said: ‘Rape victims have lifetime anonymity and the publication of a rape victim’s name is a criminal offence.’ When confronted about his Twitter message Cox, 20, said:  ‘What Ched Evans did was totally unacceptable but there are thousands of people tweeting about it, not just me. ‘I didn’t think about the content before passing it on. I didn’t even know if it was the girl involved or not.’ Sheffield United yesterday announced an internal probe into the tweets from Brown. Jailed footballer Ched Evans is being supported by his girlfriend and her wealthy family despite being convicted of raping a teenager. Natasha Massey, 24, lives with her  parents in a £1.5million property in  Alderley Edge, Cheshire, close to the homes of Manchester United’s Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra. Her father Karl Massey is a director  of 11 companies, including prestigious jewellers Cottrills in nearby Wilmslow, which is popular with the privileged ‘Cheshire set’. Support: Natasha Massey, pictured right, is understood to have told her friends that she will stand by her boyfriend Ched Evans and that she is still ‘deeply in love’ with him . Evans and Miss Massey, who have been dating for two years, have been photographed with a rare 1972 Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Spyder in a promotion for the jewellers. They were also pictured together at  a Cottrills ‘Rolex dinner’, described as  an ‘evening of fine dining, fine wines and a tasting of the very rarest Dom Perignon vintages’. Miss Massey is understood to have told her friends that she will stand by her boyfriend and that she is still ‘deeply in love’ with him. In tatters: The career of Sheffield United's Welsh striker Ched Evans, left, is now in ruins following his conviction for rape . Her mother Susan has also expressed her support for the Sheffield United striker who was sentenced to five years in jail on Friday. On the day he was sentenced she tweeted: ‘Absolutely devastated! My love goes to Tash and Ched! He is INNOCENT.’ Natasha’s sister Imogen, 19, tweeted: ‘I’m in shock! He’s innocent! This can’t happen!’ There was no answer at the Massey home when the Daily Mail called last night. The detached mansion, which sits in acres of gardens, had a BMW, a Jaguar and two motorcycles on the drive.

"When Jose Mourinho answered a question about the new £5billion television contract on Wednesday evening, spontaneous applause broke out in the room from a group of Chelsea fans listening in. ‘When I was living in Italy and Spain I was paying about £200 a month to have the Premier League at my house,’ he said. ‘I think the Premier League is better when I am here.’ He really believes that stuff and so do his legions of supporters. Jose Mourinho and his Chelsea backroom team celebrate the late winner against Everton on Wednesday . Mourinho embraces Branislav Ivanovic after Chelsea's Premier League victory at Stamford Bridge . Mourinho speaks to the media at the post-match press conference on Wednesday night . Sportsmail's team of reporters discuss whether Jose Mourinho's off-the-field antics are starting to harm his and the Premier League's reputations. Click HERE to read. With that razor-sharp quip he walked out, heading back towards the manager’s office at Stamford Bridge to discuss with members of his backroom team the mayhem that occurred on the pitch in the 88th minute. On Thursday night, when the FA announced that Branislav Ivanovic had escaped punishment for throttling Everton substitute James McCarthy and then laying his forehead on him, it was regarded by the club as a major victory. They ignored the rationale, the television pictures that clearly showed referee Jonathan Moss on the scene when Ivanovic grabbed McCarthy round the neck after Gareth Barry had nobbled Willian. The TV images showing Ivanovic’s head make contact with McCarthy’s left ear were inconclusive, according to a panel of three former referees. Because of that, Ivanovic has got off scot-free. This literally is a fight for the title, with Chelsea happy to antagonise the FA, the opposition, officials, TV companies and the rest of the media with this increasingly odd behaviour. Mourinho has everybody on the run and on Thursday it was the turn of the FA to produce a series of statistics in an attempt to disprove his theory that a campaign has been started to destabilise Chelsea. Since 2005, Arsenal, Manchester City and Newcastle United have been charged six times by the FA for incidents that were not seen by the match official. Manchester United, Stoke City and Chelsea have been charged four times. The idea that there is a vendetta is a myth.

Mourinho (left) and assistant coach Steve Holland get animated against Everton on Wednesday night . Still, given Mourinho’s consistent claims about the injustices in the game, it would certainly help if the FA publicly clarified the position surrounding off-the-ball incidents. Confusion reigns. When he was questioned about Gary Cahill’s off-the-ball kick in the back of Harry Kane at White Hart Lane on New Year’s Day, Mourinho responded with a query about Raheem Sterling’s escape for raising his hands to Swansea defender Federico Fernandez. On Tuesday, Mourinho highlighted the FA’s failure to take any action against an unnamed player (Robin van Persie) for the glance at James Tomkins before the Manchester United man elbowed him at Upton Park on Sunday. From time to time, the Chelsea manager tosses in Arsene Wenger’s shove on him at Stamford Bridge on October 5, for which the Arsenal manager went unpunished. The memory plays tricks sometimes and Mourinho’s acolytes have forgotten how miserable life was in the weeks and months before he was sacked by Roman Abramovich in 2007 after drawing 1-1 with Rosenborg. We are close to revisiting that era, returning to a period when English football had earned a rest from the Chelsea manager. Mourinho (right) and Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger during a match at Stamford Bridge last October . Mourinho (left) celebrates wildly after Chelsea beat Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium last year . Seven years on they brought him back and just over a year into his five-year deal, nothing has changed. It is a sad day when the normally mild-mannered Chelsea assistant manager Steve Holland is seen haranguing the fourth official, as he did repeatedly on Wednesday. With coaching assistant Rui Faria, who fell to his knees and then grasped colleague Silvino Louro in a bearhug after Willian’s dramatic 89th-minute winner, it is to be expected. Now Holland is at it as well. In recent weeks, Chelsea’s technical area has become like the Dog & Duck at chucking out time. Someone needs to call time on it. What happened to winning with dignity or showing a bit of class? What a shame because Chelsea have a brilliant team, seven points clear of Manchester City in the Barclays Premier League and hurtling towards the title. At this rate it is in danger of being tainted.

With the exception of Abramovich, there is no one on the Chelsea staff who is prepared to tell Mourinho to fall into line. There is no question who runs the show there. Not only that, he is being allowed to run rings around English football.","The FA announced on Thursday that Branislav Ivanovic escaped punishment after grabbing James McCarthy around the neck .

"In a move that could escalate tensions around the Arab world, the leader of the Hezbollah militant group called for protests against the movie and said the U.S. must be held accountable for the film. In a televised speech, Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah pushed for the creation of an international law that would ban insults of Islam and other religions, citing similar laws that exist to prevent anti-Semitism. His outrage stems from the anti-Islam film produced by a mysterious convict based in California, that has since sparked protests outside American embassies in the Middle East and across the globe. Arguing for action: Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah pushed for the creation of an international law that would ban insults of Islam in wake of the offensive film that prompted global protests . 'Those who should be held accountable, punished, prosecuted and boycotted are those directly responsible for this film and those who stand behind them and those who support and protect them, primarily the United States of America,' Mr Nasrallah said. He called for protests on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, urging protesters to call on their leaders to express their anger too. 'We should not only express our anger at an American embassy here or there. We should tell our rulers in the Arab and Muslim world that it is ""your responsibility in the first place"" and since you officially represent the governments and states of the Muslim world you should impose on the United States, Europe and the whole world that our prophet, our Quran and our holy places and honor of our Prophet be respected,' he said. In Pakistan, police fired tear gas and water cannons at the protesters in Karachi after they broke through the barricade and reached the outer wall of the U.S. Consulate. The protesters threw stones and bricks, prompting the police to beat back the crowd with their batons. The police and private security guards outside the consulate also fired in the air to disperse the crowd. One protester was killed during the clash, said Ali Ahmar, spokesman for the Shiite Muslim group that organized the rally. The protests were set off by a low-budget, crudely produced film called 'Innocence of Muslims', which portrays Muhammad as a fraud, a womanizer and a child molester. Tensions flare: Pakistani Shiite Muslim . protesters throw stones toward the police as they attempt to reach the . US consulate during a rally against an anti-Islam movie in Karachi . Emotions run high: Thousands of protesters shout . slogans during a march in Lahore, Pakistan, against an anti-Islam film . made in the U.S. Call for action: Protesters in Lahore are . demanding that the Pakistan government immediately end diplomatic . relations with all Western countries and recall its envoys to protest . the film . A 14-minute excerpt of the film, which is both in English and dubbed into Arabic, has been available on YouTube, although some countries have cut access to the site. The violence began Tuesday when mainly Islamist protesters climbed the U.S. Embassy walls in the Egyptian capital of Cairo and tore down the American flag from a pole in the courtyard. Chris Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya, also was killed Tuesday along with three other Americans, as violent protesters stormed the consulate in Benghazi. President Barack Obama has vowed that the attackers would be brought to justice but also stressed that the U.S. respects religious freedom. The President's response was echoed by former Prime Minister Tony Blair, who called into BBC's Radio 4 Monday morning to discuss the continued violence. Mr Blair, now Middle East envoy for the Quartet of powers, said: 'The film, it may be wrong and offensive but it is also laughable as a piece of film-making. Urging understanding: Former Prime Minister Tony Blair said 'The film, it may be wrong and offensive but it is also laughable as a piece of film-making.' 'What I am afraid is very dangerous and actually is wrong is the reaction to it.' Mr Blair said such problems were an inevitable consequence of the Arab Spring that has overthrown repressive regimes in Libya and elsewhere. 'I just see a region that is in the process of huge transition. There is essentially a struggle between the forces of modernisation, who want an open society, a properly functioning economy, who recognise the 21st century is the 21st century, and then those of reaction based on a perverted view of religion, that want to pull the whole thing backwards,' he said. 'When you lift the lid off the repression what comes out are a whole lot of religious, ethnic, tribal influences that themselves have to be countered and moulded into something that is compatible with the modern world.' Going global: The protests spread to Indonesia as American flags were burned outside of the U.S. embassy in Jakarta . Aiming for Americans: By protesting with English posters, these Pakistani students tried to get their point across to an international audience . Mr Blair said he had changed his view since his time in Number 10, when he used to avoid discussions about faith. 'What the politicians often want to do - for totally understandable reasons, I used to feel this myself - is religion is such a tricky subject for us that we want to stay away from it,' he said. 'But one element of resolving this is about a view of religion that is also open-minded and pluralistic. 'And what you actually require for democracy to function properly is a view of democracy in which religion has its place but where you have democracy-friendly religion as well as religion-friendly democracy.' He added: 'In the end we need both the leadership within those countries and within Islam to stand up and say ‘look, there is a proper modern way of reconciling religious faith, democracy in society’, and we need ourselves from the outside to engage with this process of change in a way that’s constructive.'","Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah gave a televised speech condemning anyone who supports the anti-Islam film .

"In a private room at one of Roy Hodgson’s favourite London restaurants on Thursday, England’s head coach confirmed that Harry Kane is to dine at the top table from now on. Hodgson was in the celebrity haunt, Scott’s of Mayfair, chewing the fat over the darling of English football after 23 goals in a Tottenham shirt drew him to national attention. Next month, when Hodgson names an England squad for a Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley on March 27 and a friendly in Italy four days later, Kane will be the signature dish. Tottenham striker Harry Kane has bee in sublime form for Spurs and is set to earn an England call up . England’s head coach said: ‘Is he worth a place in the squad now? Of course he is. ‘We bought a lot of young players in during my time. We had Saido Berahino in the last squad. ‘He (Kane) certainly deserves a place in the squad as much as, say, Saido did. ‘Is he worthy of a place like Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck and Daniel Sturridge or whoever? Well, that’s something he’ll have to prove. ‘Unless I give him a chance in the squad he’ll never get a chance to prove that anyway. Certainly, I like to think I do show a certain degree of loyalty to players who have been playing for a while and who I know I can trust. The 21-year-old, seen scoring at Anfield on Tuesday, has scored 23 goals for Tottenham this season . Harry Kane celebrates scoring against Liverpool (left) with his performances impressing Roy Hodgson . ‘But I also like to think that I’m prepared to give someone a chance when he’s really showing with his current form that he’s worthy of a place with us. Tim Sherwood started it with Harry Kane at the end of his reign last year by putting him in the team and he didn’t do badly. ‘Now Mauricio (Pochettino) has put him in and I’m delighted for us, delighted for the lad as well because he looks like the sort of player who has had to work very hard for his success. It’s not something that’s come overnight, he’s had to put in a lot of hard work.’ Hodgson also had praise for Danny Ings, the Burnley striker who continues to score goals for a team that has been deep in the relegation mire all season. Hodgson (centre), watching QPR play Southampton, will name his next England squad in March . Burnley striker Danny Ings, who scored at Old Trafford on Wednesday, has also caught Hodgson's eye . Ings, 22, has scored nine times for Sean Dyche’s team in his maiden season in the Barclays Premier League and is expected to join Liverpool when his contract expires in May. Hodgson added: ‘Danny Ings has impressed me as well, when we had that get-together, when I was watching the Under 21s and he impressed me. I think we need to keep an eye on him. ‘John Stones is now back from injury, that’s good news for us. I am lucky at the moment, quite a few players have already started to make their mark. Ryan Mason is another one - I like the look of him as well. Jordon Ibe is very young, but we have a lot of young players like that he would have to jump over.’ 21-year-old Kane has now scored 13 Premier League goals for Spurs, including two against Arsenal . There are hurdles for Berahino to overcome after he was banned from driving for 12 months in January after pleading guilty to drink- driving on the M6 in Cheshire last year. Hodgson promoted the West Brom striker into the senior squad in November, but he has been reprimanded by the increasingly powerful figure of the FA’s director of elite development, Dan Ashworth. The England head coach added: ‘It’s been dealt with. He has been reprimanded and as far as we are concerned the matter is closed. ‘It is up to him to put that behind him and show with his future behaviour that he has taken the reprimand on board.’ Hodgson also spoke about Jack Wilshere after the Arsenal and England midfielder was pictured holding a shisha pipe in London on the night of the Super Bowl. England’s head coach, like Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, insisted he had no issue with it and even admitted that he had smoked shisha in the past. England midfielder Jack Wilshere is now back in full training with Arsenal after another injury setback . Hodgson said: ‘I thought tobacco was smoking and shisha pipes were water with flavour — well you are blowing in and you’re blowing out. ‘As an ex-cigar smoker, when I tried shisha I thought it was a complete nonsense, I couldn’t understand who would do it. ‘Apart from a faint fruity taste in your mouth that was about the end of it. As far as I am concerned that is a club matter and Arsene dealt with it very, very well. ‘If you are asking me, in an ideal world is that an ideal thing to happen? Of course it isn’t, but we don’t live in an ideal world.’","Tottenham striker Harry Kane has 23 goals for Spurs so far this season .

"Civil rights advocates and lawyers say recent cases involving Texas State Troopers conducting roadside cavity searches with little or no cause indicate 'some sort of standard practice'. In two recently publicized cases on opposite sides of the state, troopers have pulled over women for minor infractions - which the women often deny - and ended up conducting cavity searches. In both incidents, the troopers' dash-cam captures the women being probed in their private parts by a female trooper summoned to the scene by the initial male officers. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Invasive: Female trooper Kelley Helleson, left, aggressively searched Ashley Dobbs, 24 . Officials have deemed the searches, conducted in full view on the side of the road, unconstitutional and say that there is no official policy encouraging the searches. But lawyers for the victims and civil rights advocates say that the fact the two incidents occurred in separate parts of the state and involved different officers indicates some kind of department complicity. 'The fact that they both happened means there is some sort of [department] policy,' Jim Harrington of the Texas Civil Rights Project told the New York Daily News. 'It’s such a prohibited practice. I don’t know why they think they can do this. It’s mind-boggling.' Peter Schulte, an attorney and former Dallas police officer, said that the practice may have spread around the state from region to region, rather than being an order from above. 'I think the Department of Public Safety is trying to figure out who in the world trained these troopers to think that this is OK,' Schulte told the Daily News. 'The law just doesn’t support that. It just doesn’t.' Out: State trooper David Ferrell, pictured, has been suspended after subjecting two women to invasive body cavity searches . Pulled over: The women were initially stopped by Helleson's colleague David Farrell on State Highway 161 near Irving, Texas . The victims of the first invasive search, Angel . Dobbs, 38, and her niece Ashley Dobbs, 24, filed a lawsuit against the . two troopers and the state Department of Public Safety last December. The . women, from Irving, Texas, claim in the suit that they were violated when Trooper Kelly Helleson . subjected them to a humiliating and invasive body search that was caught . on video. The 'unconstitutional' search took . place in full view of passing cars on State Highway 161, near . Irving. Ashley and Angel Dobbs claim the trooper used the same blue . latex gloves while searching both of them. The women were initially pulled over by Farrell after he saw one of them throw a . cigarette butt out the window. Farrell can be heard in the . disturbing video questioning the pair about marijuana after supposedly . smelling the drug in the women's vehicle, though he failed . to find any evidence of it in the car. Despite that, he requested the women be searched because they were 'acting weird'. Violating: Helleson, pictured left, also rubbed the women's breasts . Angel Dobbs passed a roadside sobriety test and the women were given warnings for littering. 'This has been an eye-opening experience . for me,' Angel Dobbs said on the video. 'I've never been pulled over, never searched like this. I was . totally violated over there a few minutes ago... this is so embarrassing . to me.' 'They didn’t even search my socks or my shoes,' Angel Dobbs said. 'I just couldn’t fathom how you could search someone’s butt and their vagina, and not search their socks or shoes.' The suit reads: 'Angel Dobbs was . overwhelmed with emotion and a feeling of helplessness and reacted . stating that Helleson had just violated her in a most horrific manner.' The two women are also suing the . director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, Steven McCraw, who . they claim ignored previous complaints about 'unlawful strip searches, . cavity searches and the like.' Lawsuit: The women are also suing the director of the Texas Department of Public Safety for ignoring prior complaints about searches . Humiliating: Angel Dobbs, 38, pictured right, claims she will never forget the humiliating, invasive experience . 'Unconstitutional': The search is being deemed unconstitutional in the lawsuit . The Dobbs' lawyer, Scott H. Palmer, said the shocking incident, which was filmed on one of the trooper's dash-mounted cameras, was a roadside 'sexual assault.' He said the Texas Rangers investigated his clients' complaints but failed to take any action against the troopers. The women said the 'molestation' has scarred them for life. 'I've never been so humiliated or so violated or felt so molested in my entire life,' Angel Dobbs told NBCDFW.com. Her . niece added: 'I don't think anybody needs to have to feel, or go . through what we went through. It crosses my mind every day. It's . humiliating.' The Texas trooper who performed the . roadside body cavity searches of two women using the same latex glove . was indicted on charges of sexual assault and two charges of . official oppression. A Department of Public Safety spokesman said Friday that Helleson was fired but is appealing that decision. The trooper who called Helleson to do the search, David Farrell, was indicted on a theft charge, according to the Dallas Morning News. Abused: Angel Dobbs, 38, right, and niece Ashley Dobbs, 24, left, were pulled over on State Highway 161 near Irving, Texas, and searched . In the second case, friends Brandy Hamilton, 26, and Alexandria Randle, 24, told reporters how they were ordered out of their vehicle, not permitted to put on clothes to cover the bikinis they'd been wearing at the beach that day, and given cavity searches right by the side of the road. The disturbing video of the event, which was caught on the dash-cam, captures one of the women asking in disbelief, 'Are you serious?' when the officers tell her they're going to give her a cavity search. Speaking about police searching people for drugs, Brandy Hamilton said, 'If it comes to that, then take the person into jail, you don't have to do it on the side of the road.' The women are suing the Texas Department of Public Safety and the sheriff of Brazoria County, Texas, where the stop occurred. Their lawyer alleges that the search was meant to humiliate them and was conducted without probable cause. Routine: Randle and Hamilton were pulled over for speeding but were then subjected to an invasive search that left them feeling violated . Disbelief: The Trooper calls for a female officer because he's not going to get near the young womens' 'woman areas' The female officer who performed the invasive search, which included inserting a finger into the women's vaginas, is also accused of using the same pair of gloves to search both women. Attorney Allie R. Booker told MailOnline her client's case is startling similar to the Dobbs case.Booker said a third case, that has yet to become public, bears the same hallmarks as well.'How are these people behaving in the same manner, hundreds of miles away from each other. There's got to be some factor at the DPS that makes these officers think they can do this,' she said.Miss Hamilton and Miss Randle were on their way home to Houston from Surfside Beach on May 28, 2012, when they were stopped for speeding by DPS trooper Nathaniel Turner.Turner immediately asks both women to step out of their car. Both were wearing only their two-piece swimsuits from their time at the beach.Ms Hamilton, the driver, asks if she can put her dress on to cover up. 'Don't worry about it. Come out here,' the trooper tells her. Violated: Hamilton is handcuffed despite not having committed any crime, and Officer Turner didn't allow her to cover up her bikini after  ordering her out of the car . Hard to watch: Hamilton asks, 'Do you know how violated I feel?' but the officers are clearly unconcerned . Turner says he can smell marijuana in the car and accuses the women of smoking and driving. He later claimed that he found a piece of a smoked marijuana blunt under the back seat of the car. He then makes the two women sand on the side of a busy highway in their swimsuits while he calls for backup. 'One of them has got her zipper open on her pants of her daisy dukes shorts - whatever they are,' the trooper says on the radio. Two more troopers show up - including Jennie Bui. Bui, as trooper Turner explains, 'is going to search you.' 'I ain't, because I ain’t about to get up-close and personal with your woman areas… she is going to put some gloves on,' he says. 'You're going to go up my private parts?' asks Hamilton, sounding bewildered. Both women can be seen with pained looks on their faces as the trooper probes their genitals. Miss Randle sobs uncontrollably as she is probed. At one point Turner says: 'Don’t smoke weed in your car and you won’t have to go through this.' Booker, the lawyer for the two women, said the behavior of the troopers was outrageous. Family support: Randle (front, left) and Hamilton (front, right) spoke out about their ordeal recently . 'If the cavity search alone isn't enough and say it's their fault that you basically just sexually assaulted them - that's humiliating,' she said. Turner later released both women and issued Miss Hamilton a citation for possession of drug paraphernalia. She is still fighting the charges in court, though she contends the marijuana wasn't hers. Trooper Bui was fired last week by the DPS. Trooper Turner has been suspended, Booker said. 'These police officers are here to protect and serve,' Brandy Hamilton told KHOU11. 'And they did not protect me at all. Not one of them.'","Concern is growing that recent cases Texas cops conducting roadside cavity searches indicate wider departmental policy .

"Manchester City star Samir Nasri has launched an attack on title rivals Chelsea, claiming Jose Mourinho’s team ‘are not special at all’ and predicting a slip-up to allow his team back into the title race. French playmaker Nasri accused Chelsea of being a one-man team in Diego Costa who rely too much on physical strength. ‘I’m a big fan of Mourinho, but I am not impressed with his team, not at all,’ said Nasri. ‘We have played Chelsea twice this season, once with 10 men, and were better than them. Samir Nasri celebrates after Manchester City scored their second goal against Stoke City on Wednesday . Nasri (centre) shoots to score City's fourth goal in their 4-1 victory at the Britannia Stadium . ‘When I have seen some of their games, I don’t think they are that fantastic — they are just strong, and have a good striker up front. ‘For me they are not special at all, and I think they are going to make some mistakes. We just have to perform, to win our games, and see what’s going to happen.’ Chelsea stayed seven points clear of City by beating Everton with a late goal from Willian on Wednesday night while Manuel Pellegrini’s side won 4-1 at Stoke. It was City’s first Premier League win since New Year’s Day, with Sergio Aguero scoring his first goals since returning from injury.

We have 42 points to fight for, and if we reach 90 points we will be champions of England.’ Nasri’s optimism has been defiantly echoed by some of the senior players at the Etihad. Pablo Zabaleta argued: ‘We are Manchester City and we never give up, simple as that. ‘We have 13 games to go to the end.

"Reform: Critically ill patients will be able to benefit from new drugs years before they are approved for general use under new fast-track rules . Patients with life-threatening and serious diseases will be able to get new drugs years before they would normally be available under a Government-backed scheme. The fast-track plan would help patients with cancers or dementia where there is no effective treatment left from existing medicines. It will mean drugs can be prescribed on the NHS – paid for by the manufacturer – before they are licensed. This could mean new medicines become widely available to desperate patients ‘several years’ earlier than under the existing system. The prostate cancer drug abiraterone, for example, could have been available around two years before it was licensed. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency will examine data from ongoing trials in order to approve a drug as a ‘promising innovative medicine’. It will also need to gain a positive scientific opinion, saying the benefits outweigh the risks, which it is hoped would be granted within two to three months. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the early access scheme due to start next month would boost industry by attracting investment and help patients. He said ‘This ground-breaking scheme will provide cutting edge medicines earlier, give hope to patients and their families and save lives. And as part of our strategy for life sciences it will create more jobs and opportunities for people, helping secure a better future for our country.’ The plan means medicines will be given to patients before the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) has decided whether to approve NHS funding. Once a drug has been fully licensed for use, it will come out of the early access scheme and be assessed by Nice. Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said ‘Time is of the essence for many cancer patients, particularly those with more advanced disease. It can mean the difference between life and death. ‘Therefore this scheme, which has at its heart the potential to bring promising new medicines to patients faster, is to be warmly welcomed. ‘The scheme should also make it more attractive for life sciences companies to conduct their development activities in the UK, which will bring a multitude of benefits to the population.’ It is thought anything from one to 12 drugs a year could qualify for early access. Although doctors are currently allowed to prescribe unlicensed drugs by taking personal responsibility for a ‘named patient’, the new system will provide confidence to them and patients that the safety risks and benefits have been professionally assessed prior to licensing. However, the individual doctor would still be liable if anything goes wrong, according to the Department of Health. Under the plan, pharmaceutical firms will be able to gain experience of how their medicines are being used in the NHS, it said. Firms would also ‘work closely with regulators to look at the value of the drugs, gaining guidance and advice much earlier in the regulatory process.’ Drug companies would still be able to offer new medicines via trials and on compassionate grounds. Medication: It is thought anything from one to 12 drugs a year could qualify for early access . Robert Meadowcroft, chief executive of the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign, said ‘This is a welcome step by the Department of Health towards addressing the lengthy and at times convoluted process of bringing a drug to market. ‘For people with some forms of muscular dystrophy, every day counts and a year could be the difference between walking unaided and using a powered wheelchair, between breathing independently and needing a ventilator to support lungs through the night. ‘The long wait for potential treatments to make their way through three stages of clinical trials can be agonising - particularly when followed by a drawn-out licensing process. We need urgency in the supply of safe and effective treatments to these families.’ Paul Catchpole, director of value and access at the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), said ‘The early access to medicines scheme will benefit patients, the NHS and the UK clinical research community, of which our industry is a part. ‘Most importantly, it means that patients with some life-threatening or seriously debilitating conditions - without adequate treatment options - will be able to get faster access to important innovative medicines as these will be made available before launch, following an assessment by the MHRA.’ Dr Ian Hudson, Chief Executive of the MHRA, said ‘We are delighted that the Early Access to Medicines Scheme will be launched in April 2014. 'The scheme is intended to enable patient access to medicines for treatment of life threatening or seriously debilitating conditions where there is an unmet need. This is a major new development in medicines policy in the UK.’","New plan means drugs can be prescribed on NHS before they are licensed .

"Arrival: Prince Harry has arrived in Sydney, Australia, ahead of his appearance at the harbour tomorrow . A mystery drone has crashed into Sydney Harbour Bridge - just three days before Prince Harry arrives at the harbour to review an international navy fleet. The prince, who arrived in Sydney  this afternoon, is due to make an appearance at the city's harbour tomorrow to help Australia celebrate its navy's centenary. He will be joined by more than 55 warships, galleons and tall ships from around the world. However, counter terrorism teams have been placed on high alert after the remote-controlled 'quad-copter' was discovered at the foot of one of the iconic bridge's pylons. Officials have said they do not believe the drone - which crashed on Wednesday -  is linked to the International Navy Fleet Review, which has already attracted thousands of spectators to Sydney Harbour and its foreshore. No one has yet come forward to claim the aircraft, and an investigation has been launched by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA). 'Investigations are continuing, but anyone with information or who knows who owns it is invited to contact police,' an official told the Sydney Morning Herald. Police are understood to be examining footage captured by a camera attached to the drone. Mr Peter Gibson, a CASA spokesman, said: 'New South Wales police have contacted CASA about an incident at the Sydney Harbour Bridge.' He said the incident involved 'a small remotely-piloted helicopter being operated as a model aircraft (which) has collided with one of the pylons'. He added: 'It is early to draw any conclusions, but this would appear on the surface of it to be operating a machine in an area which would probably be inappropriate. 'Certainly, colliding with the bridge structure is something that shouldn't have happened.' Security: Counter terrorism teams have been placed on high alert after a mystery drone crashed into Sydney Harbour Bridge on Wednesday - just three days before Harry's arrival at the harbour . Greeting: Harry waves at fans, before being escorted to his official Sydney residence, which is nestled beside the harbour . Mr Gibson pointed out that anyone . remotely-piloting a small aircraft must ensure they are kept at least 30 . yards from people, buildings or structures. Checks . have to be made with local councils where aircraft of this type can be . used - and the airspace around the Harbour Bridge was restricted, even . for small aircraft like drones, he said. Aside from the drone incident, security . around Prince Harry is likely to be extremely tight for his day at the harbour. Today, the region was already a buzz of . activity today, with crowds cheering, sailors saluting and helicopters . putting on displays while flying the Australian navy flag.

This will be followed by what officials promise to be a 'spectacular' fireworks display.","Mystery drone discovered at the foot of Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia .

"Nasa’s Opportunity rover has provided the world with incredible insights into the mysterious red planet. In its ten years on Mars, the rover has uncovered evidence of water, taken impressive selfies and been at the centre of an international probe into a ‘doughnut’ on the alien surface. But now Nasa is pulling funding for the rover, according to newly released details of its 2015 budget. Opportunity landed on Mars in 2004 in what was to be a three-month mission. 10 years later, and it is still active on the red planet . The $17.5 billion (£10.5 billion) budget, which still requires Congressional approval, will also put an end to the orbiting Mars Odyssey mission on September, 2016. ‘There are pressures all over the place,’ Nasa’s planetary science division director Jim Green said during an advisory council committee teleconference call on Wednesday. Opportunity touched down on in January 2004, several weeks after its twin Spirit. Both rovers outlasted their warranty by years, but Spirit stopped phoning home in 2010 after getting stuck in sand. A panoramic image of the Martian area named 'Lion King,' showing 'Eagle Crater' and the surrounding plains of Meridiani Planum on Mars taken by the Rover Opportunity . A selfie taken by the Opportunity rover ahead of its 10 year anniversary earlier this year . Opportunity landed on Mars in 2004 in what was to be a three-month mission. Instead the rover has lived beyond its prime mission and roved the planet for nearly 10 years. The rover is currently at 'Solander Point' at the rim of Endeavour Crater on Mars. The rover hasn't moved in over a month as it waits for better weather on the red planet. During its time on Mars, the rover has identified rock laden with what scientists believed to be clay minerals. Their presence is an indication that the rock has been altered at some point in the past through prolonged contact with water. Early discoveries by the two rovers pointed to a planet that was once tropical and moist. However, the signs of water suggested an acidic environment that would have been too harsh for microbes. More recently, Opportunity uncovered geologic evidence of water at Endeavour Crater that's more suited for drinking — a boon for scientists searching for extra-terrestrial places where primitive life could have thrived. Nasa’s Mars rover Curiosity received a better deal in the budget proposal receiving $59.4 million (£35.7 million) to support its operations next year, and a steady $58 million(£35 million) a year after that. The 2015 budget also includes proposals for $92 million (£55.4 million) for work on a new, unnamed, Mars rover that is expected to launch in 2020. The space agency currently spends about $13 million (£7.8 million) a year to support the Opportunity rover. Nasa, however, could still choose to restore funding for Opportunity if Congress approves an President Obama’s for requested budget supplement. President Barack Obama's 2015 Nasa budget plan includes funding for a robotic mission as well as space taxis to the ISS . The proposed 2015 federal budget  allocated $17.5 billion (£10.5 billion) to Nasa. The space agency has set aside $15 million (£9 million) to plan a robotic mission to Jupiter’s moon, Europa. Mars rover Curiosity will receive $59.4 million (£35.7 million) to support its operations next year, and a steady $58 million (£35 million) a year after that. Nasa’s budget also includes funding for a commercial ventures to fly to the ISS. The agency could have $1.1 billion (£600 million) next year to help at least two companies develop commercial space taxis that would do this. The new budget also includes $3.1 billion (£1.9 billion) for Nasa to operate the ISS. It provides $2.8 billion (£1.7 billion) to continue development of the Space Launch System heavy-lift rocket and Orion capsule for future human missions to the moon, asteroids and Mars. Planning for the so-called Asteroid Redirect Mission gets a boost to $133 million (£80 million) in the 2015 budget proposal, up from $78 million (£47 million) in 2014. The space agency has also set aside $15 million (£9 million) in its budget proposal to start planning some kind of mission to Europa. As well as a mission to Europa, President Barack Obama's 2015 Nasa budget includes funding for commercial ventures to fly astronauts to the International Space Station. The agency could have $1.1 billion (£600 million) next year to help at least two companies develop commercial space taxis to fly astronauts to and from the space station. The research outpost, a project of 15 nations, flies about 260 miles (420 km) above Earth. Since the space shuttles were retired in 2011, the U.S. is dependent on Russia to fly crews to the space station at a cost of more than $65 million (£40 million) a seat. Planning for the so-called Asteroid Redirect Mission gets a boost to $133 million (£80 million) in the 2015 budget proposal, up from $78 million (£47 million) in 2014. The proposed budget keeps the Hubble Space Telescope successor program - an infrared observatory known as the James Webb Space Telescope - on track for launch in 2018. It also lets Nasa begin planning for a new telescope to probe the mysterious force known as ‘dark energy’ that is driving the universe apart at faster and faster rates.

"A study by 'friendship group Oddfellows found that more than one-in-three over-70s told researchers that they considered themselves 'very happy' (file picture) It is often said that the best times of our lives are when we are young. Now, however, a survey suggests we are in fact happiest in our seventies – because after we reach retirement we rediscover the everyday joys of life. Indeed, far from being grumpy old men and women, it seems Britain’s senior citizens are more content than those younger than them. And the key to happiness, they say, is simple – good friends, good health and having the freedom to go shopping whenever you want. More than one in three over-70s told researchers they considered themselves ‘very happy’, compared to only one in six of those aged 50 to 60. The research revealed that the three most unexpected joys of retirement are regaining a social life, enjoying good health and not having to leave chores and arduous tasks until the weekend. Some 36 per cent of those aged 71 to 80 said they lived life with a smile on their face, compared to only 16 per cent of 51- to 60-year-olds. In addition, only 9 per cent of 70-somethings said they didn’t feel they had a meaningful role to play in their community, compared to 22 per cent of 50-somethings. The findings emerged in a study carried out by Oddfellows, the 200-year-old ‘friendship group’ that holds social events and provides support for pensioners, to mark the start of its annual Friendship Month. Jane Nelson, the society’s chief executive officer, said: ‘What our research shows is that it’s perfectly possible for life to begin at 50, 60 or even 70. They key is how positively you choose to use your time. If you approach retirement in the right way then you can become happier as you get older.’ She added: ‘Our study shows that the reality of retirement doesn’t necessarily meet expectations for a lot of people. ‘Many simply look forward to having a lot more time on their hands, but that can translate into loneliness, a lack of purpose and a longing for social interaction. ‘Above all, people often discover they miss the kind of camaraderie and everyday engagement that they took for granted in the course of their working lives.’ The study questioned nearly 1,000 over-50s to gauge their perceptions of retirement and their place within their communities and society. Nearly half – 45 per cent – of respondents in their fifties said spending time with friends was what they were most looking forward to about being retired. Yet nearly two-thirds of participants aged in their seventies said they considered it the most enjoyable element. Having less stress was the aspect of retirement that was both most looked forward to and most enjoyed, selected by more than 60 per cent of those questioned overall. Some 36 per cent of those aged 71 to 80 said they lived life with a smile on their face compared to only 16 per cent of 51- to 60-year-olds . The Oddfellows helps 280,000 members enjoy a social life, as well as providing care, advice and support. Throughout September its 146 branches will stage special events to ‘connect old and new friends’. Professor Tarani Chandola of Manchester University, a leading expert on the links between work, stress, friendship and happiness, said yesterday: ‘There’s a wealth of research on how people with stressful jobs get a temporary boost in happiness upon retirement, but this boost isn’t sustained by everyone. ‘Older adults who remain socially active in community and voluntary organisations like the Oddfellows are the ones most likely to maintain their happiness in retirement.’ The findings are supported by a 2011 study of the health and well-being of pensioners since 1971, which found that not only are the over-70s happier, but also better educated and enjoying a more fulfilling sex life than their counterparts 30 years ago. Professor Ingmar Skoog, who led the Swedish study at Gothenburg University, said: ‘This is the rock and roll generation born in the 1930s and 1940s now getting old and they are not going to be sitting on a park bench feeding the birds. Being 75 today is probably like being 55 was 30 years ago.’ Older people are smarter than ever too, according to intelligence test scores, due to better schooling. Researchers suggested that many may be inspired by active and glamorous 70-somethings such as American actress Jane Fonda, 76, and designer Dame Vivienne Westwood, 73.","Study by Oddfellows shows Britain's senior citizens are the most content .

"CLICK HERE to read why Xavi reckons Lionel Messi would be even BETTER in the Premier League . Barcelona pass master Xavi has a long standing admiration for the English game and admits he would have loved to have played with the likes of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard at the Nou Camp. The two midfielders have created a conundrum for a succession of England managers puzzling over how to fit them both in the same team, but Xavi insists that they have the technique to play at any level. When asked by BBC Sport which English players could play at Barca, the Spaniard said: 'I would have in my team any top technically-gifted player. Barcelona veteran Xavi (R) revealed that he was reared on watching English football . The Spanish playmaker rates Steven Gerrard (R) among his favourite current English players . Gerrard and Frank Lampard (above) have the necessary skills to play for Barcelona, says Xavi . 'Gerrard could have played for Barcelona, as could Lampard. They're players with top-quality technique. Here we prioritise technique over the physical aspect of the game. So a lot of English players could play for Barcelona.' The 34-year-old still rates Gerrard and Lampard among his favourite current English players and has praise for a couple of next generation talents. Jack Wilshere and Raheem Sterling (R) are Xavi's picks from England's next generation . 'There is a lot of talent out there and I think Jack Wilshire is an amazing player, very good. Raheem Sterling has a great future ahead of him. 'Then there's the older guys such as Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and John Terry. They're part of English history, winning every single title.' Xavi grew up watching spectacular goals scored by Southampton's Matt Le Tissier (C) The 34-year-old also recalls the so-called 'sombrero' scored by Paul Gascoigne against Scotland at Euro 96 . Xavi also revealed he was nurtured on watching English football, although the fact that his affection was reserved for exponents of the beautiful game is less surprising. 'I remember John Barnes, Paul Gascoigne and Matt Le Tissier. We used to watch a lot of English football. They used to show highlights and Le Tissier scored some spectacular goals. 'I remember the European Championships in England with Gascoigne playing some great matches and remember the 'sombrero' at Wembley [Gascoigne's goal against Scotland].
