"David Cameron last night joked that ‘assassination’ would be a ‘welcome release’ from the pressure of keeping Scotland in the UK – as the battle over independence raged ahead of tomorrow’s vote. The Prime Minister made the crass remarks at a  Downing Street gathering last night as the polls showed Scotland’s future in the Union hanging by a thread. Mr Cameron also decided against a last-minute campaign trip north of the border today – leaving his former adversary Gordon Brown to do the heavy lifting for the ‘No’ campaign while he dropped off his children at school and  visited a factory in Hampshire to highlight Britain’s plummeting unemployment. Scroll down for video . David Cameron visited Weir Minerals factory near Yateley in Hampshire today instead of Scotland . The Prime Minister used today's factory visit to hail the latest unemployment figures - which showed the jobless rate falling to just 6.2 per cent . The PM has been forced to defend his handling of the independence debate amid criticism that he has given Alex Salmond an easy ride – only venturing to Scotland a handful of times to campaign against separation. He said had no regrets about allowing Mr Salmond a referendum, but added that he was 'passionate' about keeping the Union together and revealed he had 'of course' suffered sleepless nights over the break up of Great Britain. Mr Cameron will face intense pressure over his stewardship of the Union if the Yes campaign emerges victorious on Friday morning. Speaking last night at a charity event attended by the BBC broadcaster Andrew Marr, Mr Cameron admitted the pressure of his job was intense. At the reception – in which Mr Marr was handing out copies of his novel featuring a Prime Minister who is assassinated – Mr Cameron said: ‘I have to say that after the events I’ve been facing over the past few days assassination would be a welcome release.’ Mr Cameron used the final day of campaigning ahead of tomorrow’s crunch referendum to visit a factory in Hampshire run by the prominent Scottish ‘No’ campaigner Keith Cochrane. Mr Cochrane is the chief executive one of Scotland’s biggest manufacturing companies Weir – which has not ruled out relocating its headquarters to England in the event of a Yes vote. At the visit today Mr Cameron insisted he would not resign in the event of a ‘Yes’ vote tomorrow. ‘My name is not on the ballot paper,’ he said. ‘What's on the ballot paper is 'does Scotland want to stay in the United Kingdom, or does Scotland want to separate itself from the United Kingdom? ‘That's the only question that will be decided on Thursday night. The question about my future will be decided at the British general election coming soon.’ It came after Mr Cameron acknowledged his unpopularity in Scotland in a speech on Monday. He said: ‘If you don’t like me – I won’t be here forever. If you don’t like this Government – it won’t last forever. But if you leave the UK – that will be forever.’ Mr Cameron is facing growing pressure from his own party of the plan to hand Scotland more powers over tax and welfare in the event of a ‘No’ vote. But the PM said: ‘The Conservative Party and all our backbenchers want to see the United Kingdom survive and thrive. ‘Well of course everyone who cares about our United Kingdom - and I care passionately about our United Kingdom - is nervous. ‘But I'm confident that we've set out how Scotland can have the best of both worlds.’ Polls continue to suggest that the referendum contest is going down to the wire, with three separate surveys last night all putting support for No narrowly ahead on 52 per cent, with 48 per cent for Yes. Scottish First minister Alex Salmond was out campaigning in Stewarton, Ayrshire, today . Mr Cameron spent last night at an event at Number 10 with BBC broadcaster Andrew Marr . With the opinion polls on a knife-edge, there is dismay among Tory MPs at the prospect of a possible Yes vote. The Prime Minister admitted that he was feeling ‘nervous’ ahead of the vote, but insisted that he was confident about the case for a No vote. ‘Well of course everyone who cares about our United Kingdom - and I care passionately about our United Kingdom - is nervous,’ he said. ‘But I'm confident that we've set out how Scotland can have the best of both worlds - a successful economy with a growing number of jobs ... combined with the ability of Scots if they vote No to have even more powers and even more say over how to run their own affairs in Scotland.’ Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said he was confident voters would back independence when they go to the polls. Speaking on a visit to an engineering firm in Stewarton, Ayrshire, the SNP leader said: ‘My confidence is based on what's happening in the streets and communities around Scotland, I think there's a very substantial movement towards yes because people understand this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to take the future of this country into our hands.’ But former PM Mr Brown said: ‘The vote tomorrow is not about whether Scotland is a nation - we are, yesterday, today and tomorrow. ‘It's not about whether there is a Scottish Parliament - we have it. It's not about whether there are increased powers, we are all agreed to increase the powers. ‘The vote tomorrow is whether you want to break and sever every link, and I say let's keep our UK pensions, let's keep our UK pound, let's keep our UK passports, let's keep our UK welfare state. ‘What we have built together, by sacrificing and sharing, let no narrow nationalism split asunder ever.’","PM made the crass joke at a gathering in Downing Street last night .

"Morocco will host next month's Club World Cup despite deciding not to host the Africa Nations Cup because of fears over Ebola. 'The #ClubWC 2014 will take place in Morocco and all preparations continue as planned,' FIFA said on Twitter. The tournament, which also took place in Morocco last year, is held annually and features the champion clubs of each continent. Morocco have been banned from the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations for refusing to host the tournament . CAF president Issa Hayatou is adamant that the Africa Cup of Nations should go ahead this winter as planned . Real Madrid (Europe), San Lorenzo (South America), Western Sydney Wanderers (Asia), Auckland City (Oceania), Cruz Azul (CONCACAF) and Entente Seitif (Africa) will take part, plus Moghreb Athletic, who qualified as champions of hosts Morocco. Morocco pulled out of hosting the Africa Nations Cup because it believes thousands of travelling supporters from west Africa pose a risk and wanted a postponement of at least six months. The virus has killed at least 4,950 people in the world's worst Ebola epidemic since the disease was identified in 1976. Morocco had asked for a postponement of the Nations Cup but CAF said the tournament must go ahead in January and February as scheduled, and said it would name a new host in the next few days.

"This week sees the UK’s first melon juice launching — with a whole melon in every bottle. There are two varieties of Mello, which will be launching in Ocado at a special promotional price of £1.99 throughout August and at two bottles for £4 during September. The normal price will be £2.49 for a bottle. Mello is made from pressed melons and nothing else. There is no added water, sweeteners or preservatives — and it is low-calorie, fat-free and full of vitamins and minerals. Scroll down for video . Mello is made from pressed melons and nothing else - it has no added water, sweeteners or preservatives . These includes vitamins A and C, essential for skin and hair health, and potassium, which maintains blood pressure. It is, the makers say, great to drink after a gym work-out or to cure a hangover! The brand’s founder, Rose Aldean, spent a year working out the best way to turn her home-made melon juice into a viable supermarket product and came across HPP — high pressure processing — as the best method. The juice is not heat pasteurised, which can destroy the vitamins, minerals and enzymes found in fruit, and it isn’t a cold-pressed juice which often need additives to stop them deteriorating. Instead, with HPP, the melon is skinned, deseeded and juiced and the juice is then subjected to a high level of pressure. This inactivates the micro-organisms that cause decay, while at the same time retaining the nutritional value and keeping the juice fresh throughout its shelf life.

"The need for Australian coal aided the nation through the Global Financial Crisis and fueled the economy when it needed it most. However, under new restrictions enforced by China's powerful National Development and Reform Commission, an import ban has been flagged for certain low-grade imported coal. Created with the aim of reducing pollution and improving air quality, the restrictions are set to be enacted from January 1, 2015, leaving many wondering how the fallout will impact the Australian coal industry, which may be exposed to billions of dollars in lost sales due to the changes. Scroll down for video . The restrictions created by China's National Development and Reform Commission will affect 39% of coal . At the same time, the country will also be moving to slash the amount of coal imported, a move which will give China's domestic coal miners a lift and potentially impact on the volume it imports from countries such as Australia. The restrictions apply to coal with more than 16 per cent ash and 1 per cent sulphur, a far cry from the Australian coal standard. Australian coal typically contains 24-25% ash, said Bruce Jacques of IHS McCloskey Coal, . Australia exports an estimated 49 million tonnes of thermal coal a year to China, and about 39 percent of this may be excluded if the proposal becomes law, said Morgan Stanley analysts in a September 4 report. Coal from 28 mines around Australia would be affected, the largest of which is located in Newcastle, NSW, which stands at 170 million tonnes. Resource exporters have been left to clarify what the new regulations will actually mean for the industry. Senior Industry Analyst at IBISWorld, Caroline Finch, said that the restrictions with provide additional challenges in an area where producers are already under a lot of pressure. 'Thermal coal exports for the last financial year totaled $16.4 billion.' 'These regulations will increase production cost in certain countries such as Australia, making other countries much more competitive.' 'Thermal coal is found all over the world, so Australia doesn't have a monopoly on it.' Gavin Wendt, Senior Resource Analyst at MineLife said that China had been discussing making the changes for several years, and that whilst the decision shouldn't come as a surprise to the coal industry, there would be a notable impact on Australia's thermal coal exports. 'Coal prices are under significant pressure anyway.' 'Since the GFC there hasn't been the same demand for coal.' The restrictions apply to coal with more than 16 per cent ash and 1 per cent sulphur, a far cry from the Australian coal standard. Countries such as the US have started exporting coal, flooding the market and pushing prices down.' 'If China does indeed implement this ban and stick to it, I would think there would be a reasonable impact on the coal industry because there would be a large amount of coal which doesn't meet the new standards.' 'Australia is one of the biggest exporters of coal to China. Companies such as BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto are currently producing coal that wouldn't meet the criteria.' 'They are probably putting a brave face on at the moment.' Dean Dalla Valle, President of Coal at BHP Billiton said, 'We support efforts to improve environmental standards,' 'We expect to be capable of meeting the proposed NDRC regulations, which stipulate a range of quality limits for both domestic and imported coal, should they be finalised and implemented, and do not anticipate a material impact to our business.' However, Mr Wendt has raised the problem of coal produced in Australia which does fail to meet the standards. 'The issue is, what will Australia do with coal that doesn’t meet the standards?' 'Are there ways they could wash or upgrade it to minise the harmful elements? If they can, would the cost of doing so be economically viable in the long run?' The highest restrictions will be placed upon coal usage in high-density areas in the north of China, such as Beijing,Tianjin, Hebei, and areas around Shanghai, as well as cities in the southern Pearl River Delta and the eastern Yangtze River Delta. The Mineral Council of Australia have labelled the concerns as 'misleading an unnecessarily alarmist' However, the Minerals Council of Australia has downplayed the concerns, calling the reports that the move would devastate Australia's multi-billion dollar exports to the Asian economic powerhouse 'misleading and unnecessarily alarmist...' 'The future for Australia's $2.7 billion annual coal trade with China remains strong.' Greg Evans, Executive Director of Coal at the Minerals Council of Australia said that the main coal type affected was brown coal (lignite), which Australia does not export, and low quality domestic black coal. 'To the extent it impacts imports of black coal destined for northern cities this relates to small scale coal use, not large scale power plants or other industrial users,' said Mr Evans. 'There is nothing in the information which suggests that Australian coal exporters will be disadvantaged and we are confident that we can meet the proposed specifications,' 'Australia is fortunate to have reserves of high quality black coal, which will continue to be in strong demand from established and emerging markets, including China.' 'Coal production has exceeded the demand,' said Mr Wendt . 'There is only one way coal prices will go, and that is down.'","China to implement new restrictions on coal imports to reduce pollution .

"A reptile park near Sydney is calling for public assistance in catching deadly funnel web spiders to help make antivenom. With warmer weather approaching, spider season has begun but the Australian Reptile Park is experiencing a shortage of spiders to milk. Managing operator Mike Drinkwater says there are safe ways to capture the arachnids and urges the people to exercise caution when undergoing the process. Scroll down for video . The Australian Reptile Park are calling on the public to catch funnel web spiders to help make antivenom . Managing operator Mike Drinkwater says there's a shortage of spiders at the park which is why they need public assistance to source more of them . 'We're at an all time low in spider numbers,' Mr Drinkwater told Daily Mail Australia. Previously the reptile park, in Central Coast - north of Sydney, conducted 1500 milkings for antivenom production but this year they hope to double that figure. 'The reason why we want so many is because we're aiming for 3000 milkings this season,' Mr Drinkwater said. 'This provides us with the antivenom which is a huge contributor in saving lives.' Mr Drinkwater says it's vital the spiders are caught the right way. 'Use a 20 to 30 centimetre container and place the opening of the jar near the spider,' he said. 'Then use a ruler to gently flick the spider into the container. Then put the jar upright and place the lid on. 'It's also important to put in some moist soil into the jar and also poke some air holes.' While catching spiders can be a dangerous task, Mr Drinkwater says the public have helped the reptile park source them in previous years. Mr Drinkwater says the park began the spider milking program to produce antivenom in 1981. There were reportedly 13 deaths in NSW from funnel web spiders but since the reptile park program was established, there have been no further recorded deaths. 'Our park is the sole provider of funnel web poison for antivenom,' he said. There are various drop-off points across NSW including spider hotspots in southern parts of Sydney, Newcastle and the Blue Mountains.","The Australian Reptile Park is the sole provider of funnel web poison for antivenom .

"Two Philadelphia police officers have a friend for life in the form of a dog who was missing three days before being found stuck neck-deep in mud. Sergeant Mike Martin and Officer Mike Kushner received a call from a distressed dog owner whose beloved pup, 13-year-old Pluto, had been missing three days.

Martin and Kushner didn't hesitate to jump into the mud and pull the weak canine to safety. Pluto was away from home and without food or water for three days as he struggled to free himself from the mud. The dog was close to death and too exhausted to even muster a wag of his tail as the officers loaded him onto a makeshift gurney. Weakened: The police officers load Pluto onto a plank to carry him to safety . Recovery: Pluto rests, still muddied from his three-day ordeal, at the veterinary clinic . Subdued: Pluto at home recovering after being released from the vet . Home safe: Pluto and a little friend at safe and sound at home . Pluto's owner took him to Sugartown Veterinary Hospital where he was treated. The pooch is now back home with his family and doing well. Pluto's owner said, 'We feel very fortunate indeed that you are there and always quick to respond, skilled and compassionate.' Had he remained much longer in the dangerous mud, Pluto would surely have died. Photographs and video from the rescue show that Pluto's nose was barely clearing the surface of the mud when the officers rescued him.

Another woman who lives next door is a nurse, and she’d been inside too and checked their pulse, but they were all dead.’ Kelly Hughes, 31, who also lives nearby said: 'I heard shouting on the street and there was police everywhere. The cops were shouting ""open the door"" at a man sat in a car. 'My partner saw him being put on the ground and arrested. It’s scary knowing it’s right on your doorstep. 'I knew the woman by sight.

"The manufacturer of the helmet worn by Phil Hughes say he was not wearing their most up-to-date model after the Australian batsman was left fighting for his life having been knocked out by a bouncer. Hughes, 25, who was pressing for a Test recall, crashed to the ground unconscious after the heavy blow to the lower head and was rushed to hospital from the Sydney Cricket Ground on Tuesday. Television images showed the helmeted Hughes, who had scored a composed 63 for South Australia in the Sheffield Shield game, standing dazed before going down face-first following the rising delivery from New South Wales bowler Sean Abbott. Scroll down for video . Hughes is currently in the Intensive Care Unit at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney's inner suburbs. He is in an induced coma and in a critical condition . Masuri released this graphic to illustrate how their old 2013 helmet may not 'fully protect' the batsman . Masuri, the UK-based manufacturer of the helmet worn by Hughes and one of the leading suppliers of protective headgear to the world's top batsmen, said in a statement they wished him a 'full and speedy recovery'. Their statement said they were seeking as much footage of the incident as possible to be able to see more conclusively exactly where Hughes had been hit. 'From the footage and pictures currently available to Masuri, it appears that Phil Hughes was struck by the ball to the rear of the grille and below the back of the shell, missing his Masuri Original Test model helmet,' the company's statement said. 'This is a vulnerable area of the head and neck that helmets cannot fully protect, while enabling batsmen to have full and proper movement.' However, Masuri's statement added: 'The newly-developed Masuri Vision Series helmet, which supersedes the 2013 helmet worn by Phil Hughes, does afford batsmen extra protection in this region –- and still allows comfortable movement.' The moment Phil Hughes  is struck in the head by a delivery during day one of the Sheffield Shield match between New South Wales and South Australia at Sydney Cricket Ground . The bouncer can be seen (left) just before it made contact with Hughes . The moments leading up to Hughes' collapse shows the cricketer paused for a couple of moments before he hit the ground . Nevertheless, it was yet to be determined whether a change of helmet could have prevented Hughes's accident or indeed if the design of the one he was wearing had played any part at all in his injury. Masuri managing director Sam Miller said: 'The thoughts of everyone at Masuri are with Phil Hughes and his family. 'Helmet manufacturers are constantly developing their products to make them safer. 'We work continuously with the governing authorities worldwide to reduce the risk of injury to players.' A spokesman for Masuri told AFP the new Vision Series helmet had gone on sale in the UK in August 2014. This is the moment batsman Phillip Hughes collapsed and hit the ground face first at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Thursday afternoon . He was helped by New South Wales players after falling to the ground . The New South Wales players yelled out for help after Hughes was hit . Former England fast bowler Stephen Harmison said he had been 'horrified' by Hughes's injury, particularly as he was a top-order batsman. Harmison, who in the first Test of the 2005 Ashes at Lord's struck Ricky Ponting, one of cricket's greatest batsmen, with a delivery that hit the then Australia captain between the helmet and the grille, drawing blood from the Tasmanian's cheek, told BBC Radio Five: 'It's horrifying seeing something like that happen to a top-order batsman. 'You sometimes fear for lower-order players, bowlers especially when they're batting and facing the quick bowlers. You don't fear too much for the top-order batsmen because they're good players and they're used to fending off short balls. New South Wales players Sean Abbott (right) and Steve O'Keefe are pictured at the Sheffield Shield on Tuesday, when the tragic event occurred . Cricket Australia team doctor Peter Brukner briefs the media outside Sydney's St Vincent's Hospital . 'It just looked like a freak accident,' added Harmison, echoing comments made by other leading cricketers and experienced observers. 'It's saddening and sickening to see such a fantastic player in the position he's in. We all hope he pulls through.' Safety standards for helmets in English county cricket, where Hughes has had spells with Middlesex, Hampshire and most recently Worcestershire, were already in the process of being improved prior to his accident. Angus Porter, chief executive of England's Professional Cricketers' Association, said: 'There is a new British safety standard which is in the process of being implemented that will hopefully offer a greater measure of protection. The critically injured Hughes was carted by medical transport vehicle to a waiting ambulance as doctors worked to treat the batsman . Players and ambulance officers raised a white sheet to shield Hughes as he was loaded into a waiting vehicle . 'The standard is now live and the manufacturers are working with testing houses on designs that will pass. 'The first batch of helmets are coming through now which would pass the test and we're hopeful we will see them used in professional cricket next season.' However, Porter said complete protection was impossible. 'It's difficult to know exactly what difference the standard might have made in this precise circumstance because there will always be an element of risk in cricket,' he said. 'The balls are hard and they travel fast. No design will eliminate risk completely.'

"The Federal Reserve said today that it will keep interest rates near zero until wages grow, long-term unemployment falls, and the economy shows other signs of consistent growth. The central bank retained language signaling its plans to keep short-term rates at historic lows 'for a considerable time' after it ends its monthly bond purchases after its next meeting in October. 'In the Fed's mind, the economy still has work to do, but it's improving,' said Mike Arone, an investment strategist with State Street Global Advisors. U.S. economy remains subpar: The Federal Reserve decided Wednesday that the key interest rate will remain at a record low because of many U.S. economic measures failing to grow consistently. Stock prices rose after the Fed issued a statement at 2 p.m. Eastern time after a two-day policy meeting. Traders appeared pleased that the Fed seems in no hurry to raise rates. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note ticked up to 2.59 percent from 2.56 percent before the Fed's statement. In its statement, the Fed said it will make another $10 billion cut in the pace of its Treasury and mortgage bond purchases, which have been intended to keep long-term borrowing rates low. It also clarified the process by which it will eventually unwind its low-rate policies. The Fed said it would first increase its key short-term rate before it stops reinvesting its bond holdings, which have driven the Fed's balance sheet to a record of nearly $4.5 trillion. On Wednesday, the central bank also issued updated forecasts for growth, inflation and interest rates. The median short-term rate supported by Fed policymakers at the end of 2015 is now 1.38 percent, up from 1.13 percent at its June meeting. The Fed expects slower growth this year and next than in its last projections issued in June. It predicts that the economy will grow about 2.1 percent this year, down from its June forecast of roughly 2.2 percent. That reduction likely reflects the sharp contraction in the first quarter of this year. The economy has rebounded solidly since then. Out of work: Board of Governors for the Federal Reserve System Chair Janet Yellen expressed concerns about stagnant wage growth, lack of full-time jobs, and unemployment . On the eve of the Fed's meeting this week, the financial world had been on high alert for whether the Fed would reiterate that it expects to keep its key short-term rate near zero for a 'considerable time' after the bond buying ends. With job growth solid, manufacturing and construction growing and unemployment at a near-normal 6.1 percent, many analysts had suggested that the Fed was edging closer to a rate increase to prevent a rising economy from igniting inflation. Other economic gauges have strengthened, too. The number of U.S. job openings is near its highest level in 13 years. Layoffs have dwindled. And consumer confidence has reached its highest point in nearly seven years. Despite the signs of a stronger economy, most economists think the first increase in the Fed's short-term rate won't occur until mid-2015. The Fed's new statement retained language stating that a range of labor market indicators 'suggests there remains significant under-utilization of labor resources.' Good news: Prior to the policy announcement Today, the Fed received good news on inflation with a report that consumer prices fell for the first time in 16 months . Chair Janet Yellen, who is holding a news conference, has expressed concerns about stagnant wage growth, the large number of part-time workers who can't find full-time jobs and the proportion of the unemployed who have been out of work for more than six months. The statement made only minor changes from a previous statement in the assessment of the economy. It was approved on an 8-2 vote. The dissents came from Charles Plosser, president of the Fed's Philadelphia regional bank, who had dissented at the last meeting, and Richard Fisher, president of the Dallas regional Fed bank. Both men are viewed as 'hawks' — Fed officials who are concerned about the threat of future inflation and believe the Fed should be moving more quickly to raise rates. Before the policy announcement Wednesday afternoon, the Fed had received good news on inflation with a report that consumer prices fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.2 percent in August, the first monthly drop in prices in 16 months. Over the past several years, the Fed's ultra-low rates have helped the economy, cheered the stock market and shrunk mortgage rates. A rate increase could threaten to reverse those trends. In August, U.S. employers added just 142,000 jobs, well below the 212,000 average of the previous 12 months. The slowdown was seen as likely temporary. But some analysts said it underscored that the economic outlook might remain too hazy for the Fed to signal an earlier-than-expected rate hike.","The Fed intends to keep its benchmark rate near zero until inflation remains under control and wage growth and long-term unemployment are under control .

"Thousands of children are committing acts of sexual abuse against other young people every year, the NSPCC has warned. The charity found there were more than 5,000 cases of abuse by under 18s reported to the police in the last three years. In some instances acts of sexual abuse were committed by children as young as five or six. At least 5000 cases of sexual abuse of children by other under 18s have been reported in three years. 98 per cent of them were committed by boys . The NSPCC have blamed the number on the rise of harcore porn that is readily available online. This comes after a 15-year-old boy was convicted of raping a 14-year-old girl after watching sadistic porn last week. The girl was gagged, bound and beaten up as he attempted to re-enact scenes he had seen on the internet. The boy's father condemned ministers for not protecting children from adult, especially violent,  material online. The Daily Mail has been campaigning for an automatic block on all adult material online as part of its Block Online Porn campaign. The NSPCC has blamed the rise in sadistic, easy-to-access adult porn on the internet. They say this has influenced young children . Nearly all - 98 per cent - of the 4,562 young offenders were boys and where the relationship was recorded, at least three out of five of the victims knew their abuser. More than a third of the offences were said to have been committed by a family friend or acquaintance, and one in five by family members. The NSPCC obtained the statistics through Freedom of Information requests to each of the 43 police forces in England and Wales. Only 34 forces supplied figures - revealing a total of 5,028 offences - so the true number of offences is likely to be higher, the NSPCC said. The findings follow a report by probation inspectors last month which found that police, social workers and teachers were missing the warning signs that a child may sexually offend. The NSPCC warned that easy access to indecent material could be leading to an increase in the number of children needing help. The charity has found that more children were carrying out online grooming and harassment. Claire Lilley, policy adviser at the NSPCC, said she hoped the findings would ring 'alarm bells' with authorities that the problem required urgent action. 'In some cases older children are attacking younger ones and in other cases it’s sexual violence within a teenage relationship,' she said. 'While more research needs to be done on this problem, we know that technology and easy access to sexual material is warping young people’s views of what is ‘normal’ or acceptable behaviour. 'We are treating an increasing number of children who have carried out online grooming, harassment in chatrooms and ""sexting"". 'Children who are sexually abusive . have often been victims of abuse, harm and trauma themselves. Exposure . to this can make them think abusing someone or being sexually violent is . ok. 'But evidence shows . that most young people who receive behaviour changing treatment early . on, such as that offered by the NSPCC, will not continue to sexually . abuse others or grow into adult offenders. 'If . we are to tackle this growing problem and protect young victims, more . needs to be done to identify and treat children at risk of sexually . offending. And we must do more to shield young people from an . increasingly sexualised society.' A government spokesman said: 'The number of young people cautioned or convicted for sexual offences has fallen by nearly a quarter over the past five years. 'However, these young people remain some of the most challenging in society and most have extremely complex issues and needs. 'We are driving up the skills and experience of social workers so they are better able to identify the warning signs much more quickly as well as strengthening guidance on child protection.'

"L'Wren Scott misled Mick Jagger about her debts by secretly taking out a loan against the £3 million flat he bought her and where she was found dead . L’Wren Scott misled Mick Jagger about her massive debts by secretly taking out a loan against the £3  million flat he bought her and where she was found dead, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Jagger, 70, told friends he became frustrated at pouring cash into the business while other investors warned her: ‘There is no bottomless pit of money’. Rolling Stones star Jagger, who has asked for his lover’s body to be flown from New York to Los Angeles, ploughed huge sums into his girlfriend’s company, as did other investors such as top US designer Tommy Hilfiger. And as Scott’s spokesman denied her firm was  in trouble, The Mail on Sunday  has learned that: . Last night a source close to Jagger, who is worth a reported £200  million, revealed he had been ‘blindsided’ by the extent of his lover’s woes. The source emphatically denied claims by Scott’s friends that the couple’s relationship had been strained by a series of rows over money, saying:  ‘They were inseparable to the end. He did everything he could to help and support her. There was an element of frustration [for Mick] that money was being poured away into a bottomless pit. He wasn’t the only investor to feel that way.’ But Phillip Bloch, the stylist who befriended Scott, 49, when both started out as models in Paris, claimed: ‘Everyone knew the relationship was in trouble. Her spending could be reckless. There were massive rows.’ Another friend added: ‘There was a massive argument last year when Mick learned she had secretly borrowed against the flat. ‘He bailed her out but she was going round saying he had told her, “Call me when you sort out your mess”.’ Jagger’s spokesman insisted he had never said this. Scroll down for video . Investigation: This photograph shows a police officer at the apartment block where L'Wren Scott died . Last night the grieving singer – said to be ‘deeply distressed but starting to feel better’ – was with his children in a £2,500-a-night suite at the exclusive Four Seasons hotel in Los Angeles. Scott’s body is due to be flown to LA from New York by her brother Randall Bambrough this weekend for a private wake and memorial followed by a burial next Saturday, details of which are being kept secret. Jagger’s lover of 13 years was found inside the flat he bought for her in Manhattan. Neighbours included actresses Nicole Kidman and Amy Adams. Records show the flat was purchased by a holding company, Scottland Management, in April 2010 for $5.6 million – a sum paid by Jagger. But Scott secretly took out a $1.25  million loan in February 2012 to prop up her ailing business, using the three-bedroom property as security. When she finally confessed about the loan to Jagger in February last year, the couple had an argument. A source said: ‘He bailed her out again – of course he did, he is worth £200  million. He set her up in business to begin with. It is fair to say there was an element of frustration but it wasn’t a lot of money to him.’ A source added: ‘When they first got together the relationship was very much reciprocal – L’Wren introduced him to Madonna for example – but it became all one way.’ The Mail on Sunday has been told the designer frantically sent text messages to celebrity friends on Sunday night after holding an impromptu dinner party at her home. The party was attended by her assistant Brittany Penebre – who found her body on Monday at 10.03am after receiving a text saying ‘Come over’ – and others in her apartment block, including a hedge fund manager and a lawyer. Scott was said to have been ‘stressed and disintegrating’ in the weeks leading up to her death. Records filed in the UK last October  show her company, LS Fashion Ltd, had a deficit of $5,899,548 (£3.6  million), with the designer owing creditors $7.6  million (£4.6  million). Rolling Stones star Jagger has asked for his lover's body to be flown from New York to Los Angeles . Jagger is said to be one of the main creditors of the American business. Scott borrowed from other fashion friends including, it is claimed, Hilfiger, who owns a holiday home next to Jagger’s on Mustique. One of L’Wren’s best friends, fashion writer Cathy Horyn, wrote a tribute in the New York Times last week saying Scott planned to announce the closure of her business last Wednesday. In fact, The Mail on Sunday has been told that a restructuring could have involved scaling down or possibly closing her company’s London offices, which has just eight employees. Scott’s spokesman released a statement on Friday denying that her fashion line was about to collapse. ‘As a private business, details of income and turnover are not publicly disclosed. However, it can be said that the long-term prospects for the business were encouraging,’ the statement said. It is said that Scott had financial problems before she met Jagger and was accused of ‘padding’ bills for work charged to Vanity Fair magazine. ‘When she was working as a stylist in the 1990s, she padded the budgets she submitted to the magazine for photo shoots she was styling,’ said a New York fashion editor. ‘They eventually found out and after that she was no longer allowed to handle their cash.’ Craig Avner, an artist who helped restore a villa Scott bought in the Hollywood Hills in 1996 – around the time she split from first husband Anthony Brand, a wealthy property developer – said: ‘She was slow in paying. She was always promising to give me publicity credits in return for deals I’d give her but the credits never came.’ And an interior decorator who helped furnish her house said: ‘She pulled some funny ones. She’d have me “borrow” items from stores, like antique fabric and some ball and claw feet for cabinets. ‘She never returned them and it cost me thousands because I’d guaranteed them on my credit card.’ L'Wren Scott's devout Mormon sister, Jan (pictured), 53, insists she should be returned to the family plot to lay beneath a granite memorial alongside her mother and father . L’Wren Scott’s final resting place is at the centre of a bitter dispute between her relatives and supporters of Mick Jagger, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Her devout Mormon sister Jan, 53, insists that L’Wren – who  was born Luann Bambrough – should be returned to the family plot to lay beneath a granite memorial alongside her mother and father. The gravestone – believed to have been paid for by the family – is at the Ben Lomond Cemetery, five miles from the family home in Utah. It marks where L’Wren’s adoptive parents Ivan and Lula Bambrough are buried in the shadow of the Wasatch Mountains. L’Wren’s name is etched on the back of the headstone along with those of her siblings. But last night plans were under way to fly her body from New York to Los Angeles where the grieving Jagger is currently staying in a  five-star hotel.Speaking to The Mail on Sunday from her home in Roy, Utah, Jan said: ‘No one has told me anything about a funeral.  I’ve not had a single call from anyone in the Jagger camp. I’m beside myself. ‘Are they going to make it so secret that her own family is banned from attending?’ A source close to Jagger insisted that the funeral will be held in Los Angeles with the full agreement of L’Wren’s brother Randall, who is in close contact with Jagger. He is a financial adviser who had been trying to help his sister sort out her debts during her final months. Randall is said to be ‘disgusted’ that Jan spoke to media last week, during which she claimed her sister envied her ‘simple’ lifestyle in Utah, and that  she had been unhappy with her jet-set life. Jan said: ‘L’Wren would have wanted to come home. It’s the family plot. ‘It is where we thought we would rest together for eternity.’ Memorial: L'Wren's name etched on the headstone of her parents .","L'Wren Scott misled Mick Jagger about her debts by secretly taking out a loan against the £3 million flat he bought her where she was found dead .

Scroll down for video . Nabbed: Soldiers escort head of the Beltran Leyva drug cartel Hector Beltran Leyva in Mexico City, in this handout picture taken Wednesday and released Thursday . Hector Beltran Leyva, one of the most notorious Mexican drug lords still at large, was captured on Wednesday by soldiers at a seafood restaurant . The 49-year-old Beltran Leyva and an associate were carrying . military-issue handguns, but like his adversary Guzman, he was . arrested without a shot being fired. Guzman, who was the world's . most wanted drug boss, was captured in Mexico in February. Beltran Leyva shunned luxury cars, passing himself off as a . well-off businessman, said Tomas Zeron, director of criminal . investigations at the Attorney General's office. '(Beltran Leyva) kept his operations away from his home so . as not to alter his discreet, low-key lifestyle, avoiding . attracting the attention of neighbors or friends or the . authorities,' Zeron said. Beltran Leyva now faces charges of trafficking cocaine from . Mexico and South America to the United States and Europe and a . host of other crimes. In November, the U.S. Treasury Department . said the Beltran Leyva gang was responsible for 'countless . murders' of Mexican anti-drugs and military personnel. The 49-year-old Beltran Leyva and an associate were carrying military-issue handguns when they were arrested . Hector's capture is a major victory for President Enrique . Pena Nieto, who has sought to shift focus away from the violence . that fighting the drug gangs has spawned in recent years and . onto the economic reforms he has pushed through Congress. Pena Nieto on his Twitter account touted the capture of . Beltran Leyva, who had bounties on his head of $5 million in the . United States and 30 million pesos ($2.2 million) in Mexico. Hector, who Zeron said had likely branched out into selling . synthetic drugs, was the only one of the gang's brothers known . to be involved in drug trafficking not dead or behind bars. When Mexican special forces arrested Alfredo Beltran Leyva . in early 2008, the brothers reportedly believed Guzman had sold . out their sibling, sparking a war with the boss of the Sinaloa . Cartel based in the northwestern state of the same name. Over the next three years, the rupture ushered in a new . brutality to the violence that overshadowed the 2006-2012 . administration of then-President Felipe Calderon. By 2010, the Beltran Leyvas had lost several leaders and . Hector, alias 'The Engineer,' was in control. The Beltran Leyva gang has had a reputation as one of the . most vengeful and ruthless in the business. When Hector's older brother Arturo was killed by Mexican . marines in December 2009, the government honored one of the . young marines slain in the raid and images of the family funeral . were broadcast around the country. The next day, gunmen swept into the family home and killed . the marine's mother, sister, brother and an aunt. For years, the Beltran Leyva brothers had worked with other . Sinaloan gangsters, notably Guzman, helping to manage his . network of hitmen. The brothers and Guzman hailed from the same . region of Sinaloa, and marriages also linked the two clans. The Beltran Leyva gang has had a reputation as one of themost vengeful and ruthless in the business . Beltran Leyva was arrested in the picture postcard town of San Miguel de Allende . Guzman reportedly tasked the Beltran Leyva organization with . infiltrating Mexico's security and political apparatus. Security experts went as far as to credit Hector Beltran . Leyva with having an informant inside the office of . then-President Vicente Fox a decade ago. The official, Nahum . Acosta, was arrested in 2005 but later released for lack of . evidence. At its peak, the Beltran Leyva cartel dominated . drug-trafficking in western Mexico. After the break with Guzman, . the brothers forged alliances of convenience with former rivals . in the Gulf Cartel as well as the ruthless Zetas. After Arturo's death, the Beltran Leyva organization was . weakened by infighting as a split emerged between Hector and a . faction led by U.S.-born Edgar Valdez Villarreal, alias 'La .

"Airbus is teaming up with US-based Aerospace firm Aerion to create a supersonic jet that can fly from London to New York in three hours and from Los Angeles to Tokyo in six. The Aerion AS2 business jet will fly at 1,217 mph, using proprietary supersonic laminar flow technology -  almost as fast as Concorde, which flew at 1,350 mph. The two companies announced this week that they will be joining forces on the project, sharing 'capabilities in design, manufacturing and certification'. Supersonic: The Aerion AS2  jet will use proprietary supersonic laminar flow technology,  flying at 1,217 mph . Engineers from Airbus' Defence and Space Division will work with Aerion at its base in Reno, Nevada. The cost of the AS2 is thought to be more than $100million - over £60million - and Aerion hopes test flights will begin by 2019. The jet, which will fly between major global cities, will be made mostly from carbon fibre composite material. The cost of the AS2 is thought to be more than $100million - over £60million - and test flights will begin by 2019 . Design features include wings which reduce overall drag by 20 per cent, allowing for lower fuel consumption and longer range and a luxurious 30-foot-long cabin will seat up to 12 passengers. Aerion chairman Robert M. Bass, said in a statement: 'This is a major step forward for Aerion. It puts us solidly on track toward our objective of certifying the world's first supersonic business jet in 2021.' After 27 years of service, British Airways retired the Airbus' Concorde airliner - which travelled at more than twice the speed of sound -  in Ocotber 2003, signalling the end of the supersonic passenger jet. Interior: A 30-foot-long cabin will seat up to 12 passengers in business-style comfort . Modern commercial long-haul jets typically cruise at speeds between 480 and 560 mph . The plan is to certify the plane in 2021 with first delivery in 2022. Flight testing would begin in roughly 2019. Aerion officials knew it would take a well-established original equipment manufacturer to complete the project, he said. 'We couldn't be more delighted with the choice of Airbus,' Barents said. 'We think that their footprint around the world is clearly going to help us as we develop the airplane.' Flight testing could begin on the supersonic jet as early as 2019 with it becoming available in 2021 . Billionaire Bass has been open about his personal mission to offer the first business jet to fly faster than the speed of sound, a project begun in 2002. Aerion, Chief Executive Officer Doug Nichols, told CNN:'The collaboration with Airbus was an essential piece in order to bring the expertise of a premier aircraft development concern into the fold.' The U.S. forbids civilian planes from  the sound barrier - about 750 mph per hour - while flying overland due to noisy sonic booms, but the AS2 model will fly at subsonic speeds until it reaches the ocean, when it will speed up. Over Europe it can fly at supersonic speeds without detection.","Aerion hopes test flights for AS2 supersonic business jet will begin by 2019 .

"Rumors have emerged that Jessa Seewald (nee Duggar) and her new husband Ben Seewald consummated their marriage mere hours after they tied the knot last week. According to an alleged wedding guest by the name of 'Mary B', Jessa, 21, and Ben, 19 were busted by sister Jinger, 20, in a closed room, in the act of 'lust' at the reception and in the very Arkansas church they had just been married. 'Multiple people were discussing that when Jinger opened the door to get Jess for the reception, she immediately closed the door with a look of shock on her face,' Mary B wrote on the Christian fundamentalist blog, My Life As A Stay At Home Wife And Mom. Scroll down for video . Scandal: According to an alleged wedding guest by the name of 'Mary B', Jessa, 21, and Ben, 19 (pictured), were busted by sister Jinger, 20, in the act of 'lust' at the church reception. Pictured, the couple in a snap posted to Instagram on Tuesday . Whether or not 'Mary B' actually attended the wedding, or whether the blog post is a hoax is unclear, but she did mention, 'my daughter who knows the girls from Journey to the Heart' - a local religious event. She wrote: 'I was very upset when I was told about the incident that was witnessed by [my daughters] when the door to the room [Jessa and Ben] were in was accidentally opened. 'I am not sure why they would not wait for the evening to pray and then consummate God's marriage.' The woman added: 'This really made me question Ben's headship and leadership skills. I pray he is not swayed to evil. I pray he acts as strong husband and worship leader to Miss Jessa.'

What is certain is that Jessa and Ben waited until the reception before sharing their kiss in private. The couple, who have evidently been practicing since then, posted a snapshot of themselves puckering up on Tuesday, alongside the caption: 'It's great living life with your best friend!' The new Instagram emerged alongside snapshots of the pair in their wedding finery with Jessa's modest $1598 gown from Tesori Bridal in Fayetteville, Arkansas, seen for the first time. The dress was described by People as 'modest' with 'a fully beaded bodice of Swarovski crystals and pearls, and had some of the tulle in the dress removed so it would fall exactly the way she wanted it to.' 'It was the second dress I tried on,' Jessa told the site. 'I love it.' Cinderella story: The reality star's dress consisted of  'a fully beaded bodice of Swarovski crystals' Me and my man: Ben looked dapper in a navy blue three-piece suit and red bow tie . Tesori Bridal co-owners Lindsey Stavely and Erin Bridges added they didn't know if she would like it because it wasn't 'traditional white.' Bridges then said, 'She kept coming back to this dress and all her sisters were like, 'the second one, the second one,' so everyone agreed.'

"Since Starbucks staff began writing customers' names on their cups in a bid to bring a personal touch to their service, the internet has been awash with snaps of baristas' spelling mistakes. But this photograph taken in a Hong Kong branch might just be the biggest faux pas yet. It was taken by a Starbucks customer named Virginia, who was handed her take-away coffee in a paper cup with the word 'Vagina' scrawled on it. Unacceptable: Virginia's sister posted a photograph of the cup on the Starbucks Hong Kong Facebook page . The picture was posted on the .

Goh said staff had misspelled her sister's name on previous occasions - . including once when it was written simply as 'Virgin' - and added that . Virginia's every Starbucks experience was tainted by 'fear and . anticipation'. Ms Goh said her sibling had been 'forgiving' up to now, but that the latest incident was the final straw. 'Fancy your staff not being able to spell an American name like Virginia,' Ms Goh posted on Facebook. 'Starbucks HK, you have to buck up or just not spell your customers' name anyway,' she wrote. 'It is a derogatory attitude even if it is not intentional.' More than 1,700 Facebook users have 'liked' Ms Goh's rant, which was featured on Shanghaiist.com. It joins the ranks of hundreds of photographs of similar mistakes shared online by Starbucks customers. Staff at the coffee chain ask customers what their name is as they place their order, then scrawl it on their take-away cup. When their drink is ready, customers are called by name. The policy was introduced to make staff appear friendly, but has led to entire blogs being devoted to photographs of baristas' often hilarious spelling mistakes.

"Pacific walrus that can't find sea ice for resting in Arctic waters are coming ashore in record numbers on a beach in northwest Alaska. An estimated 35,000 walrus were photographed Saturday about 5 miles north of Point Lay, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Point Lay is an Inupiat Eskimo village 300 miles southwest of Barrow and 700 miles northwest of Anchorage. Scroll down for video . Global warming: Tens of thousands of walruses have come ashore in northwest Alaska because the sea ice they normally rest on has melted . The enormous gathering was spotted during NOAA's annual arctic marine mammal aerial survey, spokeswoman Julie Speegle said by email. The survey is conducted with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the agency that oversees offshore lease sales. Andrea Medeiros, spokeswoman for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said walrus were first spotted Sept. 13 and have been moving on and off shore. Observers last week saw about 50 carcasses on the beach from animals that may have been killed in a stampede, and the agency was assembly a necropsy team to determine their cause of death. 'They're going to get them out there next week,' she said. The gathering of walrus on shore is a phenomenon that has accompanied the loss of summer sea ice as the climate has warmed. Pacific walrus spend winters in the Bering Sea. Females give birth on sea ice and use ice as a diving platform to reach snails, clams and worms on the shallow continental shelf. Unlike seals, walrus cannot swim indefinitely and must rest. They use their tusks to ""haul out,"" or pull themselves onto ice or rocks. In this aerial photo taken on September 3 and released by NOAA, some 1500 walrus are gather on the northwest coast of Alaska because the sea ice they rest on has melted . As temperatures warm in summer, the edge of the sea ice recedes north. Females and their young ride the edge of the sea ice into the Chukchi Sea, the body of water north of the Bering Strait. In recent years, sea ice has receded north beyond shallow continental shelf waters and into Arctic Ocean water, where depths exceed 2 miles and walrus cannot dive to the bottom. Walrus in large numbers were first spotted on the U.S. side of the Chukchi Sea in 2007. They returned in 2009, and in 2011, scientists estimated 30,000 walruses along 1 kilometer of beach near Point Lay. Young animals are vulnerable to stampedes when a group gathers nearly shoulder-to-shoulder on a beach. Stampedes can be triggered by a polar bear, human hunter or low-flying airplane. The carcasses of more than 130 mostly young walruses were counted after a stampede in September 2009 at Alaska's Icy Cape. The World Wildlife Fund said walrus have also been gathering in large groups on the Russian side of the Chukchi Sea. ""It's another remarkable sign of the dramatic environmental conditions changing as the result of sea ice loss,"" said Margaret Williams, managing director of the group's Arctic program, by phone from Washington, D.C. ""The walruses are telling us what the polar bears have told us and what many indigenous people have told us in the high Arctic, and that is that the Arctic environment is changing extremely rapidly and it is time for the rest of the world to take notice and also to take action to address the root causes of climate change."" This summer, the sea ice's annual low point was the sixth smallest since satellite monitoring began in 1979. Ice melting: In this aerial photo taken on September and provided by NOAA, some 35,000 walrus gather on shore near Point Lay, Alaska looking for places to rest in the absence of sea ice .","An estimated 35,000 walrus were photographed Saturday about 5 miles north of Point Lay .

"Among the reaction and criticism of Apple's latest iPhone event, one feature that many experts agree on is that its upcoming iOS 7 software is a game changer - in the way it looks and the way its new features will 'revitalise' older models. Current iPhone 5 and 4 owners, plus people with the iPad 2 and iPad Mini, can get the new software from 18 September, which means all devices released since 2010 will benefit from the release. The software has been in beta since Brit designer Sir Jonathan Ive unveiled its flatter look in June, and despite the visual changes being initially met with hostility, experts who have installed and used the operating system have been raving about it, with one classing it as 'incredible.' Apple's iOS 7 software includes a new feature called Airdrop that lets users share photos, video and contacts simply by clicking share and selecting a fellow iOS 7 user from a contacts list . Michael Liedtke from Associated Press said: 'One of the best things about Apple's latest iPhones is the slick new iOS 7 software that runs the devices. 'But that souped-up operating system could end up hurting sales because the free software upgrade will also work on iPhones released since 2010, giving owners of the older models less incentive to buy Apple's newest products.' He continues that even Apple's software boss, Craig Federighi predicts that anyone installing iOS 7 will feel 'like they're getting an all-new device.' James Chandler, head of mobile at media agency Mindshare UK told MailOnline: 'I've had iOS 7 on my iPhone 5 for the last three months and have to say that it's incredible - it is literally like getting a whole new device. 'Airdrop, quick access menu and the way photos are organised by location, event and time make for a brilliant new user experience.' The new Apple Control Center can be accessed from any screen in iOS 7, including the Lock Screen. It lets users quickly access settings, change their handset's brightness level, control playback and access AirPlay . Individual apps can also be controlled and closed by double-clicking the 'home' button and swiping up in iOS 7 . Airdrop is a brand new feature to iPhone that lets users share photos, video and contacts simply by clicking share and selecting a fellow iOS 7 user from a contacts list. A similar feature is already available for Mac computers. All transfers are encrypted and items can be sent using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. The quick access menu is called the Notification Centre and it has been revamped to show the most relevant information. It shows new mail, missed calls and other notifications, but iOS 7 additionally has a feature called Today that gives an at-a-glance look at the day ahead. The menu can also now be opened while the screen is locked. It shows live weather and traffic information, for example, updated in real-time as well as birthdays or upcoming events. In addition to the Notification Centre, iOS 7 has a Control Centre that can be opened by swiping from the bottom of the screen and lets the user quickly access the Wi-Fi and network mode settings, change the screen's brightness and play or stop music. The Control Centre looks similar to the Notifcation Menu on the latest versions of Android Jelly Bean. Individual apps can also be controlled and closed by double-clicking the 'home' button and swiping up in iOS 7. Apple's . updated photo feature has added Years, Collections, and Moments that . groups images and videos together based on when and where they were . taken. When taking shots, budding . photographers can also now focus using the volume down key on the side . of the handset, while the volume up button takes the picture. Apple's Craig Federighi, pictured, unveiled the iOS 7 software in June. It has a flatter look and was designed by Brit Sir Jonathan Ive . The new iTunes Radio streaming service, pictured will only be available to U.S phones when it launches. It lets users stream radio stations on and create playlists . The Compass app, found in the Utilities folder in iOS 6, now includes a spirit level. Apple has also added built-in a torch feature that uses the phone's flash, removing the need to install torch apps. The firm has additionally made password manager apps redundant by introducing an encrypted folder that can automatically store multiple account logins and passwords. It can save credit card details using its iCloud storage service, too. Similar to how LastPass works, the software can automatically fill forms with names, addresses and personal details to save time at the checkout, for example. Because these passwords use iCloud, the details can be synced across other iOS 7 devices. Additional new iOS 7 features include a Find My iPhone Activation Lock, that asks for an Apple ID and a password before the feature can be disabled. This means if a phone is stolen, the thief can't stop the original owner from being able to locate it. It will also prevent people from deleting data from the handset. Apple has also added the Popular Apps Near Me feature that personalise which apps appear when a user opens the App Store, based on the current location. Not all the features of iOS 7 will be available to older handsets because some require the iPhone 5S' fingerprint scanner, for example, while others work best on the high-end model's faster 64-bit chip. The new iTunes Radio streaming service will only be available to U.S phones when it launches on the same day as iOS 7. Apple's updated photo feature has added Years, Collections, and Moments that groups images and videos together based on when and where they were taken. Each year holds Collections and Moments are shown in each Collection . It lets users stream radio stations on their iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch and create playlists based on genres or artists. The service will work in a similar way to Last.fm's 'scrobbling' feature that personalises radio stations based on past listening history. A UK release date has not been confirmed, although it is likely to be dependent on agreements from record labels. Speaking at Wednesday's launch Federighi said:'iOS 7 is completely redesigned with an entirely new user interface and over 200 new features, so it’s like getting a brand new device, but one that will still be instantly familiar to our users.' He added that Apple has shipped 700 million iOS devices and 94 per cent of users are running the most recent software, iOS 6, with predictions that the majority will download the seventh-generation system when it launches next week.","Airdrop feature shares photos, videos and contacts at the press of a button .

"Detectives hunting a teenage girl who vanished in suspicious circumstances more than seven years ago today charged a man with her murder. Robert Ewing, 59, and another suspect were arrested earlier this week in connection with the disappearance of Paige Chivers on August 23, 2007. Paige was 15 when she vanished after a row with her father at their seaside home in Blackpool, Lancs. Despite appeals from police, the youngster's distraught family and TV chat show host Jeremy Kyle plus the offer of a £12,000 reward no trace of her has ever been found. During the inquiry Paige 'inherited' thousands of pounds on what would have been her 18th birthday from a trust fund set up following the death of her mother Sheila who died of a heart attack aged 48 - six months before the youngster vanished. Seven years on: Paige Chivers (left and right) was aged 15 when she disappeared in August 2007 in Blackpool . Vanished: She left home in Blackpool (pictured) 24 hours after an argument over the phone with her father . The investigation into Paige's disappearance is now being treated as a 'murder without a body.' Today . Lancashire Police said Ewing of Blackpool, had been charged with murder . and doing a series of acts with the intent to pervert the course of . justice. Paige - who . attended Montgomery High School in Blackpool - lived with her late . father, Frank, 46, a builder and brother, Jack, but was 'very troubled . and angry' over her mother's death. She left the family home 24 hours after an argument over the phone with her father over the spending of some family cash. Paige . packed her belongings in her purple suitcase and left home on 23 . August. Police believe after leaving home, she went to the home of a . middle aged man in the nearby village of Bispham to whom she had been . introduced by a teenage pal. Missing person poster: Paige (right) lived with her late father, Frank, a builder, and brother, Jack, in Blackpool . As a younger girl: Paige packed her belongings in her purple suitcase and left home on August 23, 2007 . Appeal: Paige's sister Madison Houghton (right) in August 2009 with Detective Supterintendent Kevin Toole . The . man was said to have told Paige that she could not stay at his home. He . claims he walked her to a nearby bus stop and told her to go to a local . drop-in hostel for troubled children in Blackpool. But she never . arrived and has not been seen since. Disappearance: The inquiry into what happened to Paige remains the most heavily-resourced major investigation in Lancashire Police's history . The last confirmed sighting of her by her family was that day getting on a number 11 bus. Detectives . received a letter from a mystery person who claimed to know what had . happened to the teenager. Police did not reveal the contents of the . anonymous note but urged the person who sent it to get in touch. During . the inquiry three men and a woman were arrested on suspicion of Paige's . murder - but all were released without charge. The . enquiry remains the most heavily resourced major investigation in . Lancashire Police's history with more than 2,800 people spoken to as . part of the inquiry and over 1,200 statements taken. The . investigation has been extended to Peterlee in the North East and the . Bolton area where Paige is known to have friends plus Nottingham, . Sheffield, Croydon and the South Coast of England. Police frogman have . searched a lake and ponds in the Blackpool area. During . a 2010 appeal when Paige would have turned 18, sister Maddison Houghton . who gave birth to a son Connor just days after the teenager vanished . said, 'All my brothers and sisters are all missing Paige like crazy, and . we want her to come home. Paige's very out going, she just loved . everybody, and very caring. You could hear her from everywhere - you . could hear her half way down the street. 'When . our mum died Paige couldn't handle things and she kept it all inside, I . think she probably just couldn't talk about it and decided to go. 'We . just need her to come home so we can scatter my mum's ashes and we . don't want to do that without her. I really want her to meet Conner . because he's her nephew and she hasn't seen him and she'd adore him. 'She . had some money inherited in my mum's will which she can get on her 18th . birthday. I just want to make sure and let her know that it's safe and . in the bank and ready for her when she comes home.' Earlier this week Lancashire Police confirmed: 'Following . consultation with The Crown Prosecution Service two men are due to . appear in court in connection with the murder of Paige Chivers.

"British backpacker Hannah Witheridge was attacked by three men before she was brutally beaten to death, police have revealed. General Kiattipong Kaosam-ang said officers have uncovered an important piece of evidence which makes them even more determined to catch those responsible. Thai police have been heavily criticised over the investigation into the deaths of Miss Witheridge and David Miller on Koh Tao's Sairee Beach, as the line of inquiry has changed several times. Scroll down for video . Police revealed  that Hannah Witheridge was attacked by three men before she and David Miller (right) were brutally beaten to death . Investigating officers have said they believe sexual jealousy was the motive behind the murder of 23-year-old from Great Yarmouth in the early hours of September 15. A condom has recently been recovered from the crime scene which has the young woman's DNA on its outer skin. Police have already said that DNA recovered from her body has shown that two men took advantage of her on the morning of her death. 'The discovery of the condom is an important piece of evidence,' said provincial police commander General Kiattipong Kaosam-ang. Investigating officers have previously said they believe sexual jealousy was the motive behind the murder of 23-year-old from Great Yarmouth . 'Solving this crime is going to come down to DNA matches and we are working hard on this.' Her recently-met friend David Miller, 24, from Jersey died when he was attacked after - it is believed - he went to her aid when he found her in trouble near a group of boulders on the beach. DNA found on a cigarette matches a sample taken from Miss Witheridge and police say they are hoping that matching it with a suspect would 'open the door' to finding who else was involved. 'There is no doubt the murder of Miss Witheridge was sexually motivated because none of her belongings or those of the English man were missing,' said General Kiattipong Kaosam-ang. 'Yes, the motivation for the attack is rape.' He said the attackers might have been smoking when they saw Miss Witheridge walking back to her guest house alone along the beach. Relatives of the two young British backpackers hug each other at the  Royal Thai police headquarters . Police have taken more than 200 DNA samples from men living and working in the area of the crime scene - most of them being migrant workers from Burma. But there have been no matches so far with the victims. Miss Witheridge's family said they are  'broken' by her death and revealed several days ago that they have returned to the UK with her body. In a statement, they said: 'As a family we feel enormous relief to have Hannah back at home where she belongs. 'We continue to work closely with officers to assist in the investigation and bring those responsible to justice. 'Our family is broken and require time to grieve in private - as do Hannah's many friends.'

"Fans have been standing in queues for days, anxious to get their hands on Apple's latest iPhone. So what do one group of fans do the moment they get the iPhone in their hands? Why, tear it down into little pieces, of course! However, this is standard practice for the iFixit team, who always deconstruct products to figure out the value and provenance of the components inside. The insides of a phone can be quite revealing to tech fans. You can see if corners have been shaved, or no expense spared on the components inside. You can even divulge information . about Apple's relationships with suppliers - for instance, arch-rival . Samsung seems more absent than first expected. Scroll down for video . Inside the iPhone: Despite the luxury exterior of Apple's new device, the insides are much more like a computer . This is what your £500 will get you: The iPhone was completely disassembled by the iFixit team - before they put it back together again . Apple is notorious for keeping its products sealed, not even allowing users to change the battery. However, the teardown found that while users still need special screwdrivers to open the phone, it was far easier to repair than previous models. iFixit said: 'This iPhone may be the most repairable iPhone we've seen in a while.' At least some of the processors . inside the iPhone 5 have not come from Samsung, instead coming from . relatively-unknown company Elpida. Perhaps this is because of the frosty . relationships between the two companies - coming on the back of a . billion-dollar lawsuit successfully won by Apple. Or instead it may just be Apple sharing the demand for the phone by using a range of suppliers. From the images, it also seems that . Steve Jobs's mantra that a device should be as beautiful within as it is . on the surface still holds true. The iFixit team have awarded the iPhone a . '7 out of 10' for repairability, as - despite Apple's insistence on . phones being repaired in-shop - all the components are easily accessible . and easy to re-assemble. iFixit's iPhone was purchased in Australia - the first country to sell iPhone 5s - within the first hour of trading. Inside the iPhone: iFixit.com opened their phone as soon as they purchased it, to let the tech world know about the internals of APple's new device . Getting an iPhone 5 is no easy task, as Apple prefers to keep their electronics sealed. DIY experts need to buy special Apple screwdrivers to open the unit. Once inside, users then need a special suction device to remove the screen. The . team then rushed home to tear the phone apart, with their own pair of . Apple's propriety screw-drivers at hand as Apple does not like users . opening phones themselves. After unscrewing the back-cover, the team use a suction cap to lift the screen from the rear housing. This is a step-up from previous models, which required more work to remove the screen. The team say the move means the iPhone 5 is likely to be far easier to repair than previous handsets. iFixit said: 'Compare this to the . iPhone 4s, where it took 38 steps to isolate the display assembly, and . this iPhone may be the most repairable iPhone we've seen in a while.' Removing . the screen unveils the newly designed battery which is of a longer . design and, at 3.8V, contains a fraction more than the 3.7V found on the . iPhone 4S. As other components - from audio . chips to power modules to radio antennas - we can see that the iPhone . contains many chips from the same companies which supply the vast . majority of smartphone makers. Qualcomm, . Texas Instruments and Broadcom all have components tucked inside, . suggesting they will do well from Apple's latest release. Apple is believed to have used three different manufacturers to make screens, so suppliers could vary from handset to handset. It is believed the firm made the move to ensure delays from one supplier could not impact iPhone 5 delivery dates. However, it was reported in recent week that one supplier, Sharp, had fallen behind of shipments. However, Apple appeared to be able to meet demand. The interior also reveal one of Apple's trademarks - a neat, tidy design. When the firm was set up, co-founder Steve Wozniak was renowned for his ability to create clean designs using far fewer components than the competition. The firm even used to sign the interior of the first machines to make engineers feel part of the product. Now, sadly that has ended - but the tradition of clean, simple design has survived - even though most of this will always remain hidden to most fans. What a sucker: Once the screws are removed from the iPhone, the iFixit team can lift the screen off . iFixit was founded in 2003 by Luke Soules and Kyle Wiens, after a night frustrating night pulling an old iBook laptop apart. They realised that few tech products came with an instruction manual on how to dis-assemble a device and re-assemble it. Companies . do not like consumers 'tearing down' products which, as a starting . point, will invalidate a warranty and - worst case - could lead to . injury due to faulty electrical parts. But . tinkerers and tweakers always like to get hands-on with their kit, so . Luke and Kyle began 'tearing down' new products, in a bid to build . guides for those who want a 'how-to'. Speaking of their iBook experience: 'We tinkered. We fiddled. We broke some tabs and lost a few screws. But we fixed it! Tweaking out the errors: The iFixit team, seen here pulling out the camera components of the iPhone 5, help regular users make hardware fixes for themselves . Household repairs: The website has expanded to deal with a range of household items . 'We attempted to fix some other . laptops but had trouble finding parts. So we bought a broken computer on . eBay and stole parts from it. Then we decided to start selling the . parts ourselves, and iFixit was born. 'For . the first time, it was easy for someone with no technical background or . experience to take apart a Mac. Our step-by-step instructions were . enabling people to repair Macs they wouldn't have been able to repair on . their own.' 'We thought . the instructions would be useful to our customers - and they were. But . it turned out that they were useful to a lot of other people as well. 'From . New York to Alaska, Tibet to the Faroe Islands, people have used our . guides to fix their stuff. They saved money, they kept their Macs out of . landfills, and they did it completely by themselves.' Now, everytime a popular device comes . out - in particular, the iPhone range - Luke and Kyle are on the spot, . frequently within the first hour or two, and ready to tear a device to . pieces to be the first to see inside the coveted and jealously-guarded . machines. So next time you . hear something rattling in your phone, or the screen starts going wrong, . then if you are confident with a screwdriver, consider visiting iFixit - . but be warned: if you pour coffee all over your iPhone, you will need a . miracle to bring it back to life. Standard components: The display connector is held firmly to the logic board by a few simple Phillips screw . Bespoke and standard: Apple has their own 'A6 processor' on-board, while Qualcomm, who supply HTC among others, supply the phone antenna chip . 'This contact connects the metal frame around the front-facing camera to . the frame around the rear-facing camera. Maybe this frame is some kind . of an antenna? Only time will tell. There are all kinds of metal-to-metal contacts inside the iPhone 5. Spring contacts make for easy repairs, but mandate careful attention to . cleaning all the parts before reassembly. Inside the iPhone: 'Spring contacts make for easy repairs, but mandate careful attention to cleaning all the parts before reassembly' Finger oils can get in the way of these metal contacts and cause frustrating component failures. Speaking of antennas, a 'spudger' easily pries one end of an antenna connector off of the logic board near the battery. In . the iPhone 4S, this antenna location was reserved for the cellular . antenna. We won't know for sure what this antenna's purpose is until we . uncover more.' iFixit has published teardown guide for all of Apple's main competitors, from the latest Blackberry to Samsung's Galaxy S3. The images below reveal the different approaches other manufacturers use. The Samsung Galaxy S3, the iPhone 5's arch rival. It uses a plastic casing which users can take off themselves tho change the battery.

"It was a chat with a stranger at a party that saved Manoly Viravong’s life. The mother of two, who had been waiting for a kidney transplant for five years, struck up a conversation with Veronica Buttigieg, a friend of a friend she had never spoken to before. The talk turned to health and Mrs Viravong’s disappointment that her brother had decided against donating one of his kidneys to her. Friends for life: Manoly Viravong (left) and her Veronica Buttigieg who donated her kidney to the other . But Mrs Buttigieg, 53, did more than . just politely sympathise. Over the clink of glasses and chatter of the . other guests, she made an amazing offer. ‘Why not have one of my kidneys?,’ she asked. Two months later, the operation took place and Mrs Viravong, 45, is well on the way to recovery. Mrs Buttigieg, who lives with her husband Mario, 54, a painter and decorator, said she would happily donate again if she could. ‘I barely knew Manoly but after talking to her and hearing of how . desperate she was, I felt it was the right thing to do,’ she said. Mrs Viravong, who has suffered from kidney problems for 18 years, is still astonished at her good fortune. ‘I did not know Veronica very well at all. We have a mutual friend and I . had seen her at social gatherings a handful of times but we had never . really talked,’ she recalled. From strangers to sisters: Manoly Viravong (left) was thrilled to receive a kidney from Veronica Buttigie . ‘Shortly after arriving at the party, which was a friend’s 40th wedding . anniversary, she offered me her kidney. Just in a really casual way. ‘I thought that she was joking, so I just said thank you. But then I realised that she was serious. ‘I asked her if she was really sure, and she said she was positive. Two . days later she had gone to the hospital to be tested to see if we were . compatible. ‘When I found out we were a match I was stunned. I just couldn’t believe it.’ In the UK between 1 April 2010 and 31 March 2011... There were 3,740 organ transplants, thanks to 2,055 donors . 1,008 lives were saved in the UK through a heart, lung, liver or combined transplant . 2,732 patients' lives were dramatically improved by a kidney or pancreas transplant . A further 3,564 people had their sight restored through a cornea transplant . 1,045 living donor kidney transplants were carried out accounting for more than a third of all kidney transplants . More than 60 kidney transplants were as a result of altruistic donors or paired and pooled donations . Almost 675,000 signed up to the NHS Organ Donor Register, bringing the total to 17,751,795 . For more information visit the NHS Blood and Transplant website . The women both live in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, and the operations took . place in July, on the first day of the school summer holidays, so Mrs . Buttigieg, who teaches sick children at Basildon Hospital, could be back . at work in time for classes to resume. Her husband and sons Richard, 20, and Robert, 22, supported her . decision, although they became increasingly anxious as the operation . neared. ‘Mario is used to me,’ Mrs Buttigieg said. ‘When I offered Manoly my kidney, she turned to him and asked if it was . all right. He simply said “if that is what she would like to do”.’ As the operation loomed, the family became more concerned, aware that . any type of surgery involving a general anaesthetic always carries a . risk. ‘We all knew there was a chance I could die,’ Mrs Buttigieg said matter-of-factly. ‘But I wasn’t worried at all. I am a Christian and I felt that God said . it was right. I had a real peace about it because I knew it was what God . wanted me to do. I felt completely calm.’ Since the operation in July, the women have become the closest of friends. Mrs Viravong, who is originally from Laos, is well enough to consider . reopening the Thai restaurant she used to run with husband Sene, but . closed due to her ill health. Veronica with Hannah Perry an organ donor nurse. Veronica donated her kidney in an operation in July . She has two teenage children, Viumee, 18, and Sam, 16, and is relishing . every moment with her family.  ‘It has been wonderful. I have got my . life back,’ she said. ‘For two years I had endured eight hours of dialysis a night and my . kidneys were deteriorating. My life expectancy was very short – it would . have killed me ultimately. ‘I had been feeling very low because my brother had changed his mind . about giving me his kidney, yet here was a virtual stranger offering to . do an amazing, wonderful, selfless thing for me. ‘I can’t really thank her enough.  We are very close now, like sisters. I’m really grateful to her and I count my blessings every day.’ As they waited at the Royal London Hospital before surgery, Mrs  Viravong kept asking her new friend if she was definitely sure. ‘She said she was positive but she just wanted them to get on with it. ‘After that it was a few days before we could talk to each other again. ‘When I saw her, I just cried and cried. We held each other and I told her how grateful I was.’ By the time of the transplant, Mrs Viravong’s kidneys were functioning at just 10 per cent of their capacity. They remain inside her body, along with the transplanted organ. Mrs Buttigieg is back at work, going to the gym and coping perfectly well with one kidney. Although her safety net is gone if ever she develops kidney problems of . her own, she is adamant that she has done the right thing. She said: ‘I have no regrets and I would do it again tomorrow.’","Patient's brother had travelled from Laos to UK to donate kidney but pulled out at last minute .

"Daniel Sturridge has revealed he will be fit to face Crystal Palace later this month. The Liverpool striker has been sidelined since September with a thigh injury suffered on England duty before sustaining a calf problem. But speaking ahead of Liverpool’s Premier League clash against Chelsea, Sturridge said he hopes to be available for selection for his side's first match after the international break. Daniel Sturridge scoring against Southampton in Liverpool's opening match of their Premier League campaign . Sturridge travelled to Madrid in the week, but was not included in the matchday squad to face the Spanish side . 'I'll be ready for that one, God willing,' Sturridge told BT Sport. Regarding his spell on the sidelines he added: 'It's the worst feeling to be honest but that's football. Everyone picks injuries up.' Sturridge has played only three times for Liverpool this term with his last outing in their 3-0 victory at Tottenham in August. The 25-year-old was not included in England's squad for next week's Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia and Roy Hodgson said he did not speak to Brendan Rodgers about the striker's fitness. Sturridge has been out of action since sustaining a thigh injury while he was on international duty . When asked if he had spoken to the Liverpool boss, Hodgson told Sky Sports News: 'No not at the moment but I have it in mind to do so of course. 'I was waiting to see what the situation would be with him (Sturridge). It's very good news to hear that he's travelled but of course before I select him again I would check with the player and the club that we were doing the right thing.'","The England international has been out of action since early September .

"A freshly baked scone, a layer of fruity jam and lashings of cream – the ingredients for a traditional cream tea couldn’t be simpler. But according to one expert you will also need a tape measure, scales and perhaps a degree in maths. Dr Eugenia Cheng, of Sheffield University, claims to have devised a statistical formula for the perfect combination of jam, cream and scones. The mathematician concluded that the best weight ratio is 2:1:1, which means an average scone, weighing 70g, requires 35g of jam and 35g of cream. The cooking instructions are precise and include guidance on how much scone there should be on the base to prevent drippage . Dr Cheng set the ideal thickness of the scone, with all its elements added, at about 2.8cm, allowing a relaxed open width of the mouth when taking a bite. The equation also specifies the thickness of the cream and jam layers. Wrangles over whether it should be jam first or cream, and whipped cream or clotted, have been running for generations, with references to the sweet treat dating back to the 11th century. The Devon tradition is to slather the scone with cream first, while the Cornish – who also lay claim to inventing cream teas – prepare their scones the opposite way. Dr Cheng says jam goes first and it must be 2.3mm thick . Dr Cheng’s formula is a victory for Cornwall, with jam spread first due to avoid it running off the edge. Another rule in the scientific method is to use clotted rather than whipped cream. This is due to the excessive volume of whipped cream needed to satisfy the weight ratio. The thickness of the layer should not exceed that of the scone. Dr Cheng said: ‘Building a good scone is like building a good sandcastle – you need a wider base, and then it needs to get narrower as it goes up so that it doesn’t collapse or drip.’ Clotted cream is better than whipped cream, primarily due to the excessive volume size of whipped cream required . The total thickness of the scone, . with all its elements, should be around 2.8cm (based on her own mouth size). This provides a relaxed . open width of the mouth . Jam, due to its density, needs to be spread prior to the application of the clotted cream . Putting it on after the cream may cause the jam to run off - creating sticky fingers . The thickness of the cream should . also not be thicker than the scone, as the scone will become off balance . whilst trying to eat it . The average scone, weighing 70g, would require 35g of jam and 35g of cream . She added that a 5mm rim should be left between the jam and the edge of the scone, and between the jam and cream. The world’s oldest producer of . clotted cream, Rodda’s Cornish Clotted Cream, which was founded in 1890, . commissioned the study. Director Nicholas Rodda said: ‘For a perfect . cream tea, you need to have the right quantities of each ingredient and . prepare them in the right way.’ He said the formula ensured the perfect cream tea ‘no matter where you are in the country’.","Sheffield University's Dr Eugenia Cheng develops perfect cream tea formula .

"Vladimir Putin today issued a Cold War-style tirade to Western leaders warning them not to 'blackmail' major nuclear power Russia. Ahead of a key summit showdown with European leaders including David Cameron, he also threatened to shut of gas supplies to the EU this winter. The tough-talking former KGB spy took aim at a 'hostile' Barack Obama who listed 'Russian aggression' in Ukraine among the top global threats alongside Islamic State jihadists and Ebola. Don't mess with Russia: Vladimir Putin had a stark message for the West while speaking today in Serbia . Old school pomp: President Putin and Serbian President Tomislav Nikolic, right, arrive for a military parade in Belgrade, the Serbian capital to mark 70 years since the city's liberation by the Red Army . He lambasted Western sanctions now hitting his struggling economy, accusing the US and EU of an 'absurd, illusory goal' in seeking to isolate Moscow. 'We are hoping our partners will understand the recklessness of attempts to blackmail Russia, (and) remember what discord between large nuclear powers can do to strategic stability,' warned the Kremlin strongman. If pro-Western but energy-starved Kiev siphons gas from a pipe carrying supplies to the EU this winter, then Moscow would cut supplies, warned Putin, after receiving a red carpet welcome in Serbian capital Belgrade. 'If we see that our Ukrainian partners begin unsanctioned siphoning of gas from the pipeline system aimed for export, we will also cut the flow for the amount of stolen gas,' he said. He warned of 'major transit risks'. Cameron is taking part in a key summit in Milan tomorrow which will see Putin hold make-or-break talks with his Ukrainian opposite number Petro Poroshenko. But last night Angel Merkel warned Putin that an enforceable ceasefire this winter depended on urgent action from Russia. Fearing the conflict could escalate, Ukraine announced it has dug a 39-mile anti tank ditch and 30 miles of other defences on a key section of its border to discourage Putin from sending his forces into its territory. Show of force: President Nikolic and President Putin review the honor guard during the welcome ceremony . Cult of personality: Serbian nationalists hold posters of Putin ahead of his appearance at the parade . Meanwhile, former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev expressed fear of a damaging return to the Cold War. He urged both the West and Putin to pull back from the brink. 'As a first step, the logic of mutual accusations and sanctions must be left behind,' the 83-year-old told Rossiiskaya Gazeta newspaper, the Kremlin's official organ. 'One must not get dragged back into a new Cold War. Shared threats to our security have not disappeared.' The elder statesman demanded the leaders concentrate on critical global threats such as the Ebola virus and the Islamic State insurgency in Iraq and Syria. 'In the face of shared challenges, we can again find a common language,' he said. 'It won't be easy but there is no other way.' But Moscow denied it had agreed to share intelligence on the IS with America.","Putin spoke at military parade to mark Red Army liberation of Belgrade .

"With her possessions crammed into a single red bag, a Romanian woman watches as police prepare to search her and her fellow beggars. This is the sight greeting dignitaries arriving in one of London’s wealthiest streets for the Olympics. Up to 40 beggars have made Park Lane their home, transforming a stretch of the central reservation into a gambling den and doss house. Unwelcome guests: Some of the 50 Romanian beggars evicted from Marble Arch last Month gambling in Park Lane after setting up a new camp in the exclusive road's central reservation . Growing problem: Officers search the Romanians as police and the council battle to keep a steady influx of migrant pickpockets and prostitutes in check . According The Evening Standard, locals said the gang had been sleeping in cardboard boxes in a subway which runs under the central reservation until the midpoint entryway was barred shut last week. Coachloads of penniless pickpockets and prostitutes are arriving in the capital every day, many already armed with maps directing them to the best patches, which they have been ordered to defend from rivals. Yesterday, police made attempts to search the beggars – while just a few yards away out of sight some of the group were urinating in the street. And this morning, two police vans were parked in Marble Arch, while a small group of six Eastern Europeans sat nearby with several large black bags. A British homeless man said it had become too dangerous to sleep out in central London because of Romanian gangs roaming around at night thieving at knifepoint. Disgusting: The group regularly urinate in the street, in full view of the area's top restaurants and hotels . Ongoing issue: Westminster Council has held a summit meeting of local agencies including the Foreign Office and representatives of the Romanian Embassy to discuss the problem . Keeping an eye out: Police vans parked outside Marble Arch, around 50 yards from Park Lane, as officers monitor the homeless group . Westminster Council has held a summit meeting of local agencies including the Foreign Office and representatives of the Romanian Embassy to discuss the problem. It repatriated 18 people to Romania recently, but only after the coach company insisted on them being given showers and new clothes before they boarded a bus. Westminster councillor Nickie Aiken said: 'These people are dispersing but they are not going away. They are either camping in Park Lane or moving into South Mayfair and around Oxford Street. 'The police and council are doing all we can about this but the taxpayers are picking up the bill, mainly the cost of cleansing because they have no toilets.' Last night, a group of around 20 - split between elderly women with walking sticks and headscarves and men in their 30s with hooded jackets and mobile phones - sat together on a tatty blanket playing dice for piles of £1 coins in the dual carriageway’s central reservation. Push-along suitcases, beer bottles and carrier bags littered the grass yards from the prestige car dealerships, Speakers’ Corner and some of the capital’s best-known hotels. 'Police here earlier, no trouble, no problems,' said one man in his 20s in broken English, before adding: 'No camera.' Transient problem: Police move members of the group, clutching bin bags, from the entrance of Marble Arch station . An elderly woman broke away from the group to pull down her tights and relieve herself against a fence. 'It’s disgusting,' said Brian Portman, 46, from New Zealand, waiting to board an open-top bus tour. 'It’s definitely not what you expect to see in London. It’s like something from the Third World,' he told the Standard. Local trader Said Ali, of Park Lane News, said: 'There’s always a group of them out there, at night I’ve seen more than 50. They go out in the day begging for money and all come back to sleep in the bushes. 'Sometimes they come in here asking to buy drinks. They always pay in change - 5ps and 10ps they’ve collected through the day. It’s not nice seeing them out there with their bags, sleeping everywhere, it doesn’t give a good impression.' Luiia Rapuano, a hairdresser at the upscale Kakan Altay salon, said: 'Some of our clients use the subway and there were piles of cardboard boxes down there where they’d been sleeping. It was like a cardboard city in the middle of posh Mayfair. 'I use the subway to go home at night and I was a little bit scared. It was awful. The council have taken all the boxes away now, so they’re sleeping rough in the bushes. We need Boris to come up here and sort it out.' Under siege: The beggars have only moved around 50 yards from Marble Arch (above), where they were evicted from last month as council workers fight to control an influx of crime gangs ahead of the Olympics . Rough deal for London: Coachloads of penniless pickpockets and prostitutes are arriving in the capital every day, many already armed with maps directing them to the best patches, which they have been ordered to defend from rivals . Sarah Greene, who has manned an ice cream booth opposite for more than 20 years, said: 'It’s disgusting. I’ve seen men from the council come down to move them on, but as soon as they leave they come back again. When you walk past the subway it stinks of urine.' The council has asked the Foreign Office and the Romanian government for a publicity campaign in Romania to try to deter people from coming. Ms Aiken said: 'This is getting worse because of the Olympics, I worry that people are being duped into thinking there are jobs here.' A Met Police spokesperson said: 'Westminster Police are working alongside Westminster City Council, the UK Border Agency and partner agencies to address these issues. 'The local Safer Neighbourhoods Team and Westminster Council will be working together to prevent any crime and anti-social behaviour linked to the recent influx of homeless people in Marble Arch.' A Westminster City Council spokesperson added: 'There is continued dialogue going on with outreach teams to try and get them to move on. 'They try to suggest that they return home and ask them what they are doing and how they are earning money. 'It is an ongoing issue and one which we think will require various strategies to tackle, including talking with the groups directly and monitoring chartered coaches arriving in London from Romania.'","Moved into central reservation after eviction from Marble Arch last month .

"It's a sunny October afternoon, and Wendy Whelan, who's been enthralling audiences for three decades at New York City Ballet, is engaged in her favorite activity: Getting down and dirty in the rehearsal studio, trying to figure things out. She swoops high onto her partner's shoulders, soaring with the music, an otherworldy look on her face. Then — oops!  — she breaks into giggles when an attempted landing doesn't quite work. Time to rejigger. Whelan, whose famous intensity onstage is belied by her frequent, easy laugh offstage, says she experiences sheer joy in rehearsals like this one. Maybe that's because she's spending it with colleagues she adores, longtime partners Craig Hall and Tyler Angle. Maybe it's also because at 47 — easily twice the age of many colleagues — she's in high-level form, having made a remarkable recovery from a hip reconstruction last year that saved her from a potentially career-ending condition. Retiring: Ballerina Wendy Whelan, seen warming up before a rehearsal, is to dance her final performancy for the New York City Ballet on Saturday after 30 years with the company . And maybe it's because she's ending that ballet career now — on her own terms, and because she's ready. After 30 years with City Ballet, almost to the day, Whelan dances her final performance Saturday, one that's sure to be marked by tears, hugs, and countless bouquets. Whelan is such a popular figure with NYCB audiences that the show sold out within minutes. 'I hope I'm not nervous,' Whelan says of the big night. 'But I know I will be.' And though retirements often are bittersweet affairs — in their implicit acknowledgment of time passing and bodies changing — Whelan says she has no regrets. 'Nope!' she says. 'It feels absolutely right.' Things didn't always feel so right. About three years ago, Whelan was pulled — too early, she thinks — from the role of the Sugarplum Fairy in 'The Nutcracker,' which she'd danced for many years. It felt, she says, 'like the beginning of the end.' A few months later, she began feeling serious pain in her hip. She felt like her heart was influencing her body, and vice versa. Beloved colleagues: Whelan seen rehearsing with one of her longtime dance partners, Craig Hall, in the Rose Building of the Lincoln Center complex in New York . On pointe: Whelan, seen rehearsing with fellow principal dancer Tyler Angle, is in high-level form - despite being twice the age of many other ballerinas . Whelan had certainly dealt with physical adversity before. Growing up in Louisville, Kentucky, she was fiercely determined to become a ballerina. But her teachers noticed a spine curvature. At 12, she was diagnosed with scoliosis. One week a month, she'd go into the hospital and spend 20 hours a day in traction. At week's end, she'd be plastered into a body cast. Even in that plaster cast, Whelan would attend ballet class. 'It weighed 15 pounds — I got really strong,' she says. Finally, she graduated to a plastic brace, which she wore for five more years. At 17, Whelan joined City Ballet. Although she missed working with the legendary George Balanchine, spotting him only once in a hallway before he died, she worked with another key NYCB figure, Jerome Robbins. But she became best known for collaborations with contemporary choreographers, serving as a muse for, most famously, Christopher Wheeldon and Alexei Ratmansky — the two most accomplished choreographers in classical dance today. 'Chris and Alexei, they've really fed me for the last 10 years — kept me curious and excited and creative,' Whelan says. Perseverance: Angle (pictured) says that 'for Wendy, it's about working, working, working until she gets it right' Wheeldon, in turn, has credited Whelan for launching his own career, with the 2001 work 'Polyphonia.' Four years later, he created 'After the Rain' for her. In its breathtaking pas de deux, she appears — long hair flowing, no pointe shoes, in just a light pink leotard — almost to fly off into the air. She'll perform that work at her farewell, along with pieces by Ratmansky, Balanchine and Robbins. To finish it off, Whelan will debut a special piece, created by both Wheeldon and Ratmansky at her request, with partners Hall and Angle. Angle credits his partner with teaching him and many others about perseverance. 'For Wendy, it's about working, working, working until she gets it right,' Angle says. Star turn: Whelan performing 'After the Rain' in 2010. In its breathtaking pas de deux, she appears — long hair flowing, no pointe shoes, in just a light pink leotard — almost to fly off into the air . Just the other night, Angle says, he and Whelan were taking bows. 'I turned and said, 'I hope you're having as much fun this season as I am,'' he says. 'It's been so wonderful seeing her enjoy herself.' Whelan is definitively not hanging up her dance shoes. She's been moving gradually into modern dance, and is booked solid with numerous projects, including a tour next year with 'Restless Creature,' a series of duets with four modern choreographers. 'Exploration. That's what I love,' Whelan says. But for now, she has to stay fit and healthy for a few more days. She's not overly concerned. Karma, she says, is with her. 'I've paid some big dues,' she says. 'I've earned a good farewell.'","After 30 years with City Ballet, almost to the day, Whelan, 47, dances her final performance Saturday .

Fellaini's agent denied . suggestions on Monday night there was a meeting between the player and Napoli's . technical director Riccardo Bigon at the Sheraton Hotel at Brussels . Airport over the weekend. However . Fellaini is aware of Napoli's interest and that the club's manager . Rafael Benitez believes he can turn him back in to the buccaneering . forward player he was when he was at Everton and wants to utilise his . physical presence. Fellaini, for his part, has accepted that Van Gaal . doesn't want him and is open to the move. However, . United want a cash sale for a player who cost £27.5m while Napoli wish . to explore the possibility of a loan. That would probably only be . acceptable to United if Napoli could fund all of Fellaini's . £100,000-a-week wage packet. On Monday, the player was back in Manchester after his efforts with Belgium in the . World Cup. Because his country reached the last eight of the tournament, . he was not required to join United's tour of America and was back at . Carrington with compatriot Adnan Januzaj for physical testing on Monday. Off the pace: Fellaini struggled badly throughout his debut season at Old Trafford . Unwanted: Louis van Gaal is hoping to offload Fellaini before the start of the new campaign . Van . Gaal - whose team face Inter Milan in Washington on Tuesday night - told United . chief executive Ed Woodward early in the summer that he didn't see . Fellaini as a United player and wanted him to sell him. It is understood . that the future looks similarly bleak for Japan midfielder Shinji . Kagawa and other bit-part players Anderson, Wilfried Zaha and Nani. Meanwhile, . Van Gaal goes into the game at Washington's FedEx Field knowing . that victory over the Italian side would leave United on the verge of a . place in next week's International Champions Cup Final in Miami. This would mean extending a two-and-half week tour by an extra three days, something that Van Gaal will have mixed views about. With . United already in talks with promoters about an offer to return to the . US next summer to play games in New York, Dallas and Chicago, Van Gaal . has told the club he wishes things to be done differently. On Tour: Manchester United are currently away in the US on a pre-season schedule . Captain for the day: Midfielder Tom Cleverley, derided by some United fans, skippered the side against Roma . The . Dutch veteran wants the tour to be a maximum of two weeks long and . wants a central US training base that United can travel to and from to . play game elsewhere. It has . been the distance between hotels, training grounds and stadia that have . infuriated Van Gaal on this tour and he wants assurances it won't happen . again. FedEx Field, for . example, is 90 minutes away from United's central Washington Hotel here . while Saturday's game against Real Madrid will be played in Ann Arbor, . 50 miles away from United's base in Detroit.","Fellaini has met with representatives from Napoli over potential move .

"A Mormon mother from Phoenix is being falsely held in a Mexican prison for smuggling marijuana after the family failed to bribe a judge soon enough, they have claimed. Yanira Maldonado was returning home with her husband after attending her aunt's funeral in Mexico last week when their bus was stopped and police claimed drugs had been found beneath her seat. When she was hauled into a prison, an attorney told her husband Gary to raise money to give to a judge because 'that's how it works here', her family said. But when the couple, who have seven children and two grandchildren between them, scraped together $5,000 for her release, they still refused to free her. Separated: Yanira Maldonado was with her husband Gary, both pictured, when they were stopped in Mexico and accused of smuggling drugs. Mr Maldonado remains in a Mexican prison . Her family is now seeking the help of their state Senator and hoping to raise awareness of her plight, in the hopes it will lead to her release. They claim that the Mormon mother, who does not drink or take drugs, is innocent. Maldonado and her husband were returning to Phoenix from her aunt's funeral when their bus was stopped at a military checkpoint near Hermosillo. When the federales searched the bus, they claimed they found drugs under a seat where the couple - the only Americans onboard - had been sitting. They initially charged Mr Maldonado but then let him go before charging his wife instead. 'Never in our lives deal with drugs or do drugs,' Mr Maldonado told Fox 10. 'Everybody from the very beginning was telling us, ""We know you guys aren't guilty, but this is just the process"".' 'Innocent': The Maldonados, who are Mormon, said they do not even drink and have never taken drugs . Family: The couple, who have seven children between them . He called it 'the most frightening feeling you could ever imagine', adding that fellow passengers saw them board the bus without packages, so he is hopeful that justice with prevail. A Mexican attorney told the couple to raise cash, Mrs Maldonado's brother-in-law Brandon Klippel told CBS 5. 'His attorney had talked to the prosecuting attorney there and came back . to him and said, ""You know how it works in Mexico, right?""' Klippel said. 'He said, ""No I don't."" The attorney said, ""Well, if we . bribe the judge – then he'll let you go"".' But when they took the money to them, they were told it was no longer about the money. 'Bribes': The couple were told they could pay off the judge because 'that's how things work here' A couple of days after her arrest, she was transferred to a women's jail in Nogales, but the family was not informed. When her husband went to visit her, he was told she had been sent elsewhere. 'He panicked,' his brother, Klippel, . said. 'He told me terror struck him. And he thought, for that period of . time, that he'd never see his wife again.' But on Saturday, he tracked her down to the holding cell and visited with one of their sons. 'She had a rough night,' Klippel said. 'Their interrogation included putting her in a non-air-conditioned room . and waking her up several times in the middle of night – trying to get . her to sign documents that she said she couldn't read.' Stopped: The couple were returning from a funeral when they were stopped at a checkpoint (file picture) Family members said Mrs Maldonado had started crying during the visit, but said that she had faith others would help. Senator Jeff Flake's office said he is personally monitoring the situation and has spoken with the deputy Mexican ambassador. Yanira Maldonado has an attorney and will appear at a hearing in front of a judge on Monday. 'In Mexico, I guess you're guilty until proven innocent,' said Klippel. 'So, it's just been a real nightmare for them.' The family is providing updates on their Facebook page.","Yanira Maldonado and her husband were stopped at military checkpoint on her way back to the U.S. from a funeral last week .

"The South African man who shot Anni Dewani dead on her honeymoon in Cape Town has died in prison from brain cancer. Xolile Mngeni was  handed a life sentence in 2012 after being found guilty of hijacking a cab that Anni and her husband Shrien were riding in, before shooting her in the neck. In July this year it was reported that he was due to be freed from prison on compassionate grounds after 11 doctors signed a waiver saying he didn't have long to live, but the attempt failed. Scroll down for video . Xolile Mngeni, the man who shot Anni Dewani dead in Cape Town while she was on her honeymoon with husband Shrien Dewani, has died of brain cancer . Shrien Dewani is currently on trial in South Africa after Mngeni's accomplice, Mziwamadoda Qwabe, told the court Dewani ordered his wife's death. Mngeni had been due to appear, but was deemed to be too ill . Mngeni was first diagnosed with aggressive tumour in 2011. He was jailed for the killing in 2012, and was back in hospital earlier this year. He had been attempting to get released from prison on compassionate grounds . In September it is believed Mngeni met with his lawyers to discuss a second bid, claiming he could be cared for at home by one of his relatives who is a health care worker, but the case was never brought back before a judge. Mngeni had been suffering from pineoblastoma since 2011, a rare and aggressive form of brain cancer which has a very low survival rate. After he was convicted of Anni's killing, her father branded the drug dealer 'a weak and spineless coward' for killing his 'defenceless' daughter. He was jailed along with accomplice Mziwamadoda Qwabe, who admitted his part in the crime, but told the court the killing had been ordered by Shrien Dewani, who paid £1,400. Mngeni (left) and Qwabe  were jailed for Anni Dewani's killing in 2012. Mngeni had been diagnosed with cancer before his trial, but after chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery, was deemed fit to stand . Mngeni and Qwabe hijacked a cab Shrien and Anni Dewani were travelling in as they drove through a notorious district of Cape Town. The men threw Shrien out, before Mngeni shot Anni in the neck, severing her spine . Qwabe has been appearing for the prosecution at Shrien Dewani's trial, saying that he  hijakced the Dewanis' car as it drove through the notorious Gugulethu township, before throwing Shrien out. He told the court that he had been driving as Mngeni turned around and shot Anni in the neck, severing her spine and killing her. He alleged that Dewani had ordered the killing to be done in this way to make it look like an ordinary street crime. It was believed Mngeni had been due to appear at the trial, but was too ill to take to the stand. Anni Dewani is pictured on her wedding day shortly before she was killed during a carjacking in South Africa . Anni Dewani's family arrive at her husband's trail in South Africa this week. It was their outcry at the possibility of Mngeni being released that, in part, led to the appeal being turned down . During his previous court appearances, Mngeni had appeared frail, and on several occasions had to use a frame to walk to the dock. Mngeni was diagnosed with cancer before his initial trial in 2012, but after several rounds of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery, he was deemed fit to stand. He was convicted and handed a life sentence, but was rushed to hospital again at the beginning of this year in critical condition after the cancer returned. His condition was stabilised, but judges were asked to consider releasing him from jail after 11 doctors assessed him and concluded that time was running out. Shrien and Anni were riding in this cab when it was hijacked by Mngeni and Qwabe. Anni's body was found slumped in the back seat the following day . The new husband, the taxi driver and the gunman... 'murder plot' which saw new bride Anni Dewani killed . On November 13, 2010, Anni Dewani was killed by a single gunshot wound to the neck while on honeymoon with her husband, millionaire Shrien Dewani. Shrien maintains his wife was killed as part of an everyday hijacking. However, he is now on trial accused of ordering her murder after others involved in the crime pointed the finger at him: . Gunman Xolile Mngeni . Mngeni was first arrested on November 16, three days after Anni was killed, at his home and charged with robbery and kidnapping. He denied the charges and was held in custody. On December 7 his accomplice, Zola Tongo, was jailed after pleading guilty. As part of his plea bargain, Tongo named Mngeni as one of the kidnappers. The following year Mngeni was first diagnosed with pineoblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. After chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery he was deemed fit to stand trial. On August 8, 2012, Mngeni's associate Mziwamadoda Qwabe also pleaded guilty to his part in the crime. At the time he told a court he and Mngeni kidnapped the couple, but said it was Mngeni who shot Anni. In November Mngeni was found guilty of premeditated murder at the Western Cape High Court. The following month he was sentenced to life in prison for the killing. In early 2014 he was rushed to hospital in critical condition after the brain tumour came back. Eleven doctors assessed his condition and ruled he should be released as he did not have long to live. However, after an outcry from Anni's family, a judge turned the request down and Mngeni was returned to jail. Earlier this month Shrien went on trial accused of ordering his wife's killing. Mngeni was thought to be a future witness for the prosecution, but earlier today he died behind bars. Taxi driver Zola Tongo . Tongo, who had been driving Shrien and Anni Dewani through Cape Town when their car was hijacked, was arrested four days after Mngeni, and held in custody by police in South Africa. Just over two weeks later he agreed to plead guilty in return for a reduced sentence of 18 years behind bars. As part of his plea bargain, he told judges that Shrien Dewani paid him £1,400 to arrange his wife's killing, a statement strongly denied by the millionaire businessman's family. In his statement, Tongo said he recruited Xolile Mngeni and Mziwamadoda Qwabe to hijack the cab he was driving before executing Anni. He says he was ordered to make the killing appear like a random street crime. Kidnapper Mziwamadoda Qwabe . Qwabe was arrested shortly after Mngeni and charged with similar offences. On August 8, 2012, after being named by Tongo as part of his plea bargain, Qwabe also pleaded guilty to Anni's kidnapping and murder and was given 25 years in jail. At the time, he told the court that he was recruited for the job by Tongo, and went on to confirm Tongo's statement. He also said that Dewani told the group that the killing must look like a street crime. He claimed that, while he hijakced the cab Anni and Shrien Dewani were travelling in, he did not kill the bride. Instead, he testified that Mngeni pulled the trigger. New husband Shrien Dewani . On the day Anni was killed, Shrien had been riding in the cab with her through Gugulethu township when Mngeni and Qwabe stopped the vehicle and hijakced it. Shrien was thrown out of the car, and the two men made off with Anni. Her body was found the following day, with a single gunshot wound to the neck. Dewani returned to the UK shortly after the killing where he had treatment for stress. After Anni's body was flown back, he attended her funeral on November 21. Shrien Dewani (left) pictured with his new bride Anni at their wedding shortly before she was killed . Shrien Dewani arrives at Western Cape High Court earlier this month accused of ordering his wife's murder . Only a few days later, he was forced to issue the first denial that he was responsible for his wife's death after allegations were made against him. On December 7, Tongo claimed in open court that Dewani ordered the killing of his wife, and the same day Dewani was arrested in Bristol under a South African warrant. At the beginning of 2011, Dewani was moved to the Priory Hospital in Bristol where he was reported to be suffering severe post-traumatic stress disorder. He was later detained under the Mental Health Act in his home city. Meanwhile, at his extradition hearing, the prosecution cited an unnamed witness who testified that Dewani said he needed to 'find a way out of' his marriage months before his wedding. On August 10, District Judge Howard Riddle ruled that Dewani could be extradited to South Africa to stand trial. However the following year, as Mngeni and Qwabe were jailed, the High Court halted Dewani's extradition on health grounds, but judges said he should still be sent abroad 'as soon as he is fit'. During his trial, Shrien Dewani has admitted to having accounts on gay dating sites such as Recon (pictured), but said he was bisexual and loved his wife . Throughout 2013, Dewani was moved in and out of mental hospitals while continuing to fight his extradition. After repeated appeals, three judges at the Supreme Court - the highest in the land - rejected Dewani's last attempt to stay extradition early this year. Dewani arrived in South Africa on April 8, and after a medical team ruled that his condition had improved, his defence council said he would be fit to take the stand. On October 6, two weeks ago, Dewani attended the first day of his trial, accused of ordering his wife's killing. So far, the court has heard that Dewani surfed gay dating websites, where he described himself as a 'submissive', and asked an older man's advice about coming out as gay. Dewani, however, denies these claims and says he is bisexual. He also told police that Anni wanted to visit the dangerous township where she was killed. Police also said he was found sobbing on the night she died. The trial continues.","Xolile Mngeni, the man who shot bride Anni Dewani dead, has died of cancer .

"It's been another busy week in the world of boxing and it's only going to get busier for me between now and May 31 – Wembley Stadium is a big stadium to fill but Carl Froch and George Groves have a better chance than anyone else of filling it. More of that later, though, because for now I want to talk about a fight that would excite me just as much. I think Kell Brook would knock Amir Khan out. I'm positive about that. Now it's time to try to make the fight. That's the hard part. I have spoken to Golden Boy Promotions, Khan's people in the US, and made Khan an offer of $5million. I'm not sure if it will happen this summer because Khan seems to be under the impression that he's above fighting Kell, but that is a fight I would love to see. VIDEO Scroll down for Froch and Groves' press conference . Matchmaker: A fight in front of a massive crowd at Wembley is a dream come true . Rematch: Carl Froch (left) and George Groves will meet in the ring once more . Khan needs to decide if that payday, and a fight of that scale, is worth turning down. I think turning it down would be a massive risk on his part and I'll explain why. Kell will be warming up for his IBF title shot against Shawn Porter with a fight in Liverpool on March 15 and I can reveal here that it will be against the Mexican welterweight champion Alvaro Robles, who has 17 wins (15 KOs) and two losses. If Kell wins that, Shawn Porter will have to defend his IBF world title against him this summer. The only fight Kell would sidestep that for is Khan. Khan has a lot to lose against Brook. If he gets knocked out, and I believe he will, I think that his career is over. He thinks he can fight Adrien Broner, Floyd Mayweather and then Kell Brook. The problem with that is Brook will go off and fight Porter and if he wins that title then there is no way Khan will be getting $5m as a challenger. Take your risks Amir, but realise what you are turning down. Offer: Amir Khan has been offered $5m to fight Kell Brook . Below him? Khan seems to think fighting Brook (right) is below him . In either case, the next few months for Kell will be massive. After what he's been through, it is time something went his way. He is 28 now and is an immense talent, a wonderful boxer who has won all 31 of his fights, but the past few years have just not gone his way. He should be a world champion by now. His career was a textbook example of progression until he was meant to fight Devon Alexander for the world title in 2013. You couldn't make up what has happened since then. Talent: Brook deserves something to go his way after what happened with injuries when he was meant to fight Devon Alexander . First, Kell injures his ankle and the . fight is postponed. It gets rearranged and 10 days out Alexander pulls . out with a bicep injury. Kell was his destroying sparring partners and . ready to a job on Alexander. Alexander's withdrawal really hit Kell . hard, he lost some of his professionalism and dedication in the sport. He had a few weeks off, put on a bit . of weight. We rescheduled the fight, came back and then he had a problem . with his foot. He went to see a doctor and they said he had two stress . fractures in his foot. That was hard for him to take. Three times that . fight was cancelled! He came . back against Carson Jones and got the job done. Then he fought . Vyacheslav Senchencko and looked fantastic. At that point he was due to . fight Alexander in March or April of this year but Alexander lost to . Shawn Porter. That was never supposed to happen. Decisions: Khan wants to fight Floyd Mayweather but will be giving up a big payday if he sidesteps Brook . That was the same night Darren Barker fought Felix Sturm. I was sat watching the Porter fight with Kell in our hotel. The look on our faces. He just kept saying, 'I can't believe it'. What are the chances? But Kell is over that now. He knows he is close to getting the huge fight he deserves. He is like my special project, a fighter who I respect and rate enormously. People might have given up on him, but I believe when he gets that chance he will rule the division. He has as much talent as any fighter in Britain and more than Khan. This will be his year. Wembley is set for the biggest British boxing event of all time. I am delighted. My dream of an 80,000 capacity crowd could become a reality. Tickets will go on sale on Monday, March 10. Wembley and the FA have done everything they can the make the fight happen and it will be on HBO in America. I'm really excited. We will put 60,000 on sale initially and I am confident they will fly away. In Manchester we sold 20,000 in 12 minutes and this is five times the size of the fight. I am anticipating huge sales on day one and two. There will be a lot more more cheap seats and tickets will start at £30. I want it to be as accessible as possible. We already have 24,000 on our email alerts. If the average one of those wants three tickets, we will be well on the way to living the dream. You NEED to be part of it. Massive: Froch-Groves II will be the biggest boxing event of all time - and tickets will start at just £30 . If ever you could back a fighter to bounce back from a defeat then it would be Ricky Burns. He lost in Glasgow on Saturday against Terence Crawford, who just had too much for him. We hoped Crawford would crack under the pressure of being the away fighter – my word, it was some atmosphere - and we were keeping fingers crossed that he wouldn’t be as good as he has looked. Unfortunately he had it all and Ricky probably wasn’t at his best coming back from an injury. I had a long chat with Ricky about his future on Sunday after the fight. He wants to be back in the gym as soon as possible. He might even fight the winner of John Murray and Anthony Crolla, which I am hoping to make. There are some big domestic fights but the target for Ricky is ultimately to win back a world title. I'd back him to be on top before long. He's a warrior. Bouncing back: Ricky Burns is a fighter you can expect to recover from a defeat . Top class: Terence Crawford showed he had it all . The demand for Anthony Joshua is at an all-time high. He gets mobbed everywhere we go. One thing that made me laugh recently was going up to Scotland for his fight at the weekend. We went through security and this older lady came up to him and said: ‘I can’t believe it’s you’. Her mouth was wide open, she was totally awestruck. He was saying ‘Thanks, that’s very kind,’ but then she just said: ‘I love your new dance show on Sky 1.’ She thought he was Ashley Banjo!

"Leaked screenshots claim to show the next version of Google's Android software have leaked online - and it appears the firm has taken a leaf our of Apple's book. The screenshots show newly redesigned icons with a 'flat' appearance - similar to Apple's iOS 7 redesign. They icons far more closely resemble those used by Google on its websites. Android's new home: accordin to this leaked screenshot of the next version of Android, the icons have been completely redesigned to look 'flat' Google's redesign will also make the Android logos look more like those used on the firm's web site . 'The rumor, if you haven't guessed it already, is that Google will be changing the style of its launcher icons for Android apps to more closely resemble those of its web properties,' said Android Police, which released these shots. 'This new style, internally referred to as 'Moonshine' would see Android icons take on a somewhat flatter appearance.' According to Android Police, the 4.5 update is known internally as Hera. It will further integrate Google's chrome browser into the Android software. The search giant is expected to unveil the new software at its developer conference, I/O in San Francisco in June. The 'flat' design was a cornerstone of Apple's recent overhaul of its iOS software, a project led by British designer Sir Jonathan Ive. The radical overhaul of the iOS software was the result of a huge power struggle within the company, which saw the previous head of iOS, Scott Forstall, outed in favour of Sir Jonathan. Forstall was Apple's senior vice president of iPhone Software, from 2007 - when the first iPhone launched - until last year when Apple announced he had resigned from his position. Forstall launched the 'skeuomorphic' design of the iOS software, which uses visual cues that have been designed to look like physical objects, for example the 'leather' on the Find My Friends app, the 'wooden' bookshelves in iBooks and the green felt in the Game Center. Now, it seems Google has taken the same decision. Apple's 'flat' Apple iOS 7 features are displayed on screen during Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2013 in San Francisco . Experts warned Apple's  radical makeover could confuse some users. Jan Dawson, chief telecoms analyst at Ovum, said it 'represents a massive overhaul of the look and feel of the operating system, which has remained largely unchanged visually since the original version.' However, it has proved to be a huge success, with a record setting adoption rate among users. The radical overhaul of the iOS software was the result of a huge power struggle within the company, which saw the previous head of iOS, Scott Forstall, outed in favour of Sir Jonathan Ive. Forstall was Apple's senior vice president of iPhone Software, from 2007 - when the first iPhone launched - until last year when Apple announced he had resigned from his position. The iOS 7 design is the first major change to the operating system since he was replaced by London-born Jony (as he is known) Ive in October last year. Ive was already in charge of industrial . hardware designs for the iMac, iPhone and iPad and there were rumours . that suggested that Forstall was forced to step down as software chief . as part of Cook's apparent desire to remove anyone who had a good . relationship with previous CEO Steve Jobs. The radical overhaul of the iOS software is the result of a huge power struggle within the company, which saw the previous head of iOS, Scott Forstall (left), outed in favour of Sir Jonathan Ive (right) There were also rumours that Forstall and Ive couldn't be in a meeting together without Cook being there to mediate. Forstall launched the 'skeuomorphic' design of the iOS software, which uses visual cues that have been designed to look like physical objects, for example the 'leather' on the Find My Friends app, the 'wooden' bookshelves in iBooks and the green felt in the Game Center. It was a design that Ive is said to have disliked and other people had criticised Forstall for its dated look. In an interview with the Telegraph, Ive apparently 'winced' when the interviewer asked him about Forstall's designs and said he wanted to make iOS 7 more simple. At last year’s WWDC 2011, Forstall introduced iOS 5 and later launched Siri on the iPhone 4S. But by October 29, Apple announced in a press release that Forstall had resigned as senior vice president of iOS. The announcement came after Apple's Q3 results showed revenues and profits grew less than predicted – the second quarter in a row the company had failed to meet expectations. Forstall had also been criticised after he launched Apple Maps due to them being inaccurate and in some cases, missing entire roads.

"The heartless thug who kicked a squirrel into the Grand Canyon in a Youtube clip has a £10,000 bounty on his head thanks to furious animal activists. PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), famous for its shock tactics and ads containing scantily clad women, are on the hunt for the man shown in the video. The charity pointed to notorious criminals such as Jon Venables, Ian Brady and Ian Huntley, who all abused animals in the past, as reasons why the act should not go unpunished. At least one of them deserves a kicking: After luring the adorable rodent to the edge he takes aim . Gone: The tiny animal flies off the edge of the canyon after the man kicks it into the abyss . The video shows two men in boxer shorts at the Grand Canyon as one of them lays out treats for the squirrel  (seen bottom right) The video has had nearly 105,000 . views and shows a shirtless man wearing boxers and a straw hat laying . out breadcrumbs for a squirrel near a cliff top. As the squirrel gets close to the edge of the cliff one man, thought to be French, sneaks up on it and boots it off the cliff. PETA UK spokesperson Ben . Williamson said: 'It is imperative that any community faced with a . sadistic and violent act such as this take measures to find the culprit . or culprits and bring them to justice. 'Animal . abusers are a danger to everyone - they take their issues out on . whomever is available to them, human or non-human, and must be caught . before they act again.' The reward will be paid to anyone who gives information leading to the arrest and conviction of the man responsible. Anyone with information is encouraged to contact Grand Canyon Chief Ranger Bill Wright on +1 928-638-7888. The 15-second video was uploaded to YouTube by a user claiming he was only just a witness and had no part in the evil joke. ‘I . did not realize what was happening until it was too late,’ Jonathan . Hildebrand wrote in his defence. ‘I do not know who they are. All I know . is that they were French.’ Danger ahead: The man walks off as the little squirrel dashes towards the treacherous trail of treats . If found, the man could face a charge that falls into a category of disturbing or harassing wildlife — a federal petty offense that carries a maximum six months in jail and/or a $5,000 fine. However it is unlikely Rangers would pursue animal cruelty under a state statute because that would require them to retrieve the squirrel and prove that it was injured or had died. Squirrels are an everyday sight at the Grand Canyon and have become accustomed to visitors, climbing on their laps, begging for food and ransacking backpacks. Park officials discourage visitors from petting or feeding wildlife because the animals can bite or attack. Do you know the person responsible?

"Google is planning to release a maps app for the iPhone and iPad in a head on battle with Apple. The search giant had its maps dumped by Apple in the latest version of its iOS software. However, now it is set to hit back with its own app - if Apple approves it. The Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol as it appears in Apple's maps. The firm has come under fire for some of its 3D photography which has distorted buildings, and is set to face fresh competition from Google's map app. It is believed Google has been working on the app for months, as Apple revealed it was creating its own mapping service in June. Maps are an extremely lucrative service for both firms due to revenue from advertisers keen to appear in searches. However, sources close to Google have claimed the app, which is expected to be free, has recently been submitted to Apple for approval. This means it could be available within days. However, Google faces one major hurdle - Apple. To have an app in the iTunes download store, it must be approved by Apple - which has tough rules on app that compete with . existing functionality'. No official statement has been made by either firm, but experts believe Apple holds the key. 'Maps generate huge amount of revenue, but the key is whether Apple will approve it - for instance, Google's voice app has been delayed for over a year,' said Stuart Miles of gadget website Pocket Lint. 'Apple could say it is too similar a product to its Maps service.' Even Transport for London has  turned on Apple's maps, with this sign being displayed at Hackney Wick station. Apple has already come under fire for its maps service, although the firm did today admit it needed improvement.

"Former Australian captain Allan Border believes the first Test should go ahead, but it'll be a very personal decision for players whether they take part. The prospect of a four-Test series against India due to start at The Gabba in seven days has become trivial for Australia's best cricketers following Phillip Hughes' tragic death. Captain Michael Clarke and vice-captain Brad Haddin have been among the many Test players to regularly visit Hughes at St Vincent's Hospital following Tuesday's freak accident.

'There will be guys, particularly the guys that were out on the field at the time that are named in the Test squad, they mightn't be feeling like playing cricket at the moment,' Border told Fox Sports before the death was confirmed by Cricket Australia. 'You'd understand if they wanted to pull out. But I think the game should go ahead. 'We're all a bit numb at the moment. 'I get the feeling that Phillip would want the game to go ahead. But if the individuals don't feel up it, then so be it.'

"Looking pale and exhausted, NSW fast bowler Sean Abbott arrived at St Vincent’s Hospital wearing a black baseball hat at 2.30pm on Thursday. In the hospital's coffee shop, where some of the cricketers had congregated, Abbott was given some words of advice from Steve Waugh, while spin bowler Nathan Lyons draped a comforting arm around his shoulders. They were there for him. He then sat down and had a coffee with his team mates, who were obviously rallying behind the young fast bowler. It was Abbott's short-pitched ball that struck Hughes and injured him as he attempted a pull shot. It was a tragically freakish accident.

Abbott and his team mates had been given counselling since the incident took place. But it wasn't just the cricketers who turned out to give support, and as it turns out, say their goodbyes, to Hughes.  Good mate and boxer Anthony Mundine was one of those who came to see him at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney's inner East. The first inkling that the worst had happened, that their mate had lost his fight, was when those players and friends who had been gathered in and around the hospital’s coffee shop left en masse to go upstairs to Hughes' bedside at 3pm. Then, about 45 minutes later, Australian vice-captain Brad Haddin re-emerged downstairs. Weeping and clearly distressed, he was comforted by family and friends. A shocked looking Ricky Ponting and batsman Steve Smith left the hospital 50 minutes later, while others stayed behind still trying to take in the harsh reality. It was a Who’s Who of cricket in Australia who came to give comfort to the opening batsman. Michael Clarke barely left his bedside.

Players left from various exits of the hospital, some in tears, some being consoled by teammates. Understandably, none of them hung around for any longer than they possibly could such was their shock and grief. Earlier this morning, former Australian test captain Steve Waugh, 49, was warmly welcomed at the hospital entrance by Aaron Finch, David Warner and Tom Cooper, who was batting with Hughes when the freak accident happened on Tuesday. No official statement had been released by the hospital. But a hospital source said that this was because there was no further news to give as 'his condition had not changed.' He was still critical, fighting for his life, and in an induced coma after emergency surgery on Tuesday afternoon.

Players gathered here by Australia's general manager, Pat Howard, before being brought up as a group to visit their stricken teammate and his family at his bedside. There had still been no official update from the hospital on Hughes' current condition. Australia coach Darren Lehmann struck a sombre figure as he walked from St Vincent's hospital after spending over an hour with Hughes' family and teammates on Thursday morning. He left with Australian batsman Aaron Finch who looked similarly downcast. Both players warmly embraced before going into the hospital, showing clearly how the tragedy has brought the Australian players even closer together.","Australia's cricket family were devastated by the loss of Phillip Hughes .

With a little planning, a Naval Officer was able to give her daughter a very special birthday treat by coming home to Michigan from California to give her a surprise celebration.

The cameras were rolling during the assembly but Sienna had no idea that they were there for her. The students gathered on Wednesday for an assembly on kindness, respect and caring for others. Towards the end, one of the presenters mentioned that it's almost Sienna's birthday, and had her stand while a video message from her mother played in the gym.

As the students sang Happy Birthday, the two hugged each other for several seconds as they both took in the enormity of the moment. Clinging shyly to her mother's uniformed arm, she murmured a few words on what it meant to her. 'I like to spend time with her,' Sienna said. 'I'm overwhelmed right now. She just looked really shocked when I saw her,' mom Shawna Welborn said to WNEM. None of this would have been possible without the help of a teacher from the school.

"An oil tycoon who owes his ex-wife £17.5 million after a divorce battle has been told to hand over £20,000 or have his appeal against an order to pay her £400,000 thrown out. Michael Prest was warned to pay the cash within 28 days or face having the appeal against paying his ex-wife Yasmin or going to jail, dismissed. At the High Court Family Division, senior appeal court judge Lady Justice Gloster, said the 52-year-old continued to live a 'lavish lifestyle' and 'clearly has the ability to pay'. Michael Prest, left, who has been told to pay £20,000 in 28 days or have his appeal against paying ex-wife Yasmin, right, £400,000 or go to jail, dismissed . His ex-wife, 51, had asked the judge to make the order for £20,000 security of her costs for the forthcoming appeal. It was said that she made the order given his failure to pay other money in the long running dispute, which has now topped £1million. At a previous hearing, Mr Justice Moylan said he was satisfied Mr Prest had the means to give the £270,000 a year he was ordered to pay his ex-wife along with the £24,000 a year for their four children. But because he has 'willfully refused' to hand over the money and was in contempt, he was told he must pay the £360,000 he still owes plus £40,000 towards his wife's £82,000 legal costs within three months, or go to jail for four weeks. The deadline of paying the cash by October 28 has been extended pending his appeal, which Lady Justice Gloster said would be dismissed if he did not lodge the £20,000 in time. In June last year, Mrs Prest won a landmark Supreme Court battle for her rightful half share of his multi million pound fortune - put 'conservatively' at £37.5m. But he has failed to pay a penny of the £17.5 million ordered by the court. Mr Prest had been living as a tax exile in Monaco, but Lady Justice Gloster was told he has had to give up his flat there and now gave his address as Nigeria. The couple, who both have dual British and Nigerian citizenship, married in 1993 and have four children. As part of the divorce Mrs Prest kept the family home in Maida Vale, West London, pictured . Despite claiming poverty the judge said he still had a home in the West Indies and she had evidence of his lavish lifestyle with skiing holidays and funding expensive litigation in the Isle of Man. She said his 'lifestyle continues to be extravagant' and added that it was once claimed that the family needed £800,000 a year to live on. The court was also told how he transferred a number of properties to his ex-wife under the divorce agreement, who the judge also described as 'not on the breadline'. But she added that because of Mr Prest's disobedience in not paying costs orders in the past it was right that he should provide security of £20,000 to cover his ex-wife's costs before the appeal could proceed. At a hearing in July, Mrs Prest's counsel Jeremy Posnansky QC said Mr Prest's 'false claims of impoverishment' and 'tale of woe', were untrue. It was heard that when in London he stayed at the £624 a night Halkin hotel and took his children on luxury skiing holidays. Mr Prest was ordered to pay the £20,000 or have his appeal thrown out by Lady Justice Gloster at the High Court, pictured . The court was also told how he spent an estimated £12,000 on buying £175 a time tickets for his children and their friends to a Justin Bieber concert. He also paid the expensive school fees for the children and took them on holiday, and bought them expensive treats. But the court heard that when it came to his ex wife, he 'will not pay anything that puts money into her pocket.' The couple, who have dual British and Nigerian citizenship, have four children after marrying in 1993. Their divorce became final in November 2011. Mrs Prest still lives in the £5 million family home in Maida Vale, West London, which she keeps under the divorce settlement.

"Stars from all corners of the entertainment world have gathered to design custom teddy bears for an upcoming charity auction to benefit child victims of sexual abuse in South Africa. Actors including Nicole Kidman, Eva Longoria and Sean Penn have put their unique spin on the cuddly toys; as well as musicians Bruno Mars and Janet Jackson, models Heidi Klum and Dita Von Teese, and designers Karl Lagerfeld and Roberto Cavalli, among others. The bears will be auctioned off in New York at Sotheby's on December 8, and all proceeds will go toOperation Bobbi Bear; a nonprofit that encourages  children in South Africa to report abuse, provides them with emotional support and helps get their offenders behind bars. Bling bear: Stars from all corners of the entertainment world have gathered to design custom teddy bears for an upcoming charity auction to benefit child victims of sexual abuse in South Africa. Pictured, Heidi Klum with her creation . Founder of Bobbi Bear Jackie Branfield launched her charity in 1992 after realizing how difficult it was for child victims of sex abuse to report their crimes. Every fourth girl under the age of 16 is raped in the South African Province of Kwa-Zulu Natal, for example, and all too often, victims are afraid to tell police about it. Furthermore, it is estimated that 51per cent of all adults in the region between the ages of 16 and 45 are HIV positive. Since most sexual offenders are in this age-group, the chances of them infecting their victims is high.

Pictured, Dita Von Teese goes with a burlesque theme . As many of these crimes go un-reported, Ms Branfield needed to find a way to get children to open up about their ordeals, so that more perpetrators could be brought to justice. She found her answer in Bobbi the stuffed bear. By communicating directly with the teddy, she learned that children could better speak about their abuse. Specific details about the crimes are written or drawn onto the bear by the children, and its use has been approved at court; ultimately leading to more convictions. The celebrities who signed up to decorate their own bears for the upcoming auction produced a league of very unique offerings.

"Big tobacco companies are pushing for electronic cigarettes to enter the Australian market as a 'medicine' but health groups fear the unregulated device could encourage young people into taking up the habit. British American Tobacco has been lobbying Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration to allow them to sell e-cigarettes at any corner stores and roll out major marketing campaign to promote the medicinal benefits of the product. The cigarette shaped devices are a multi-billion dollar industry overseas but in Australia they remain unregulated and legally contentious, according to ABC. Scroll down for video . The cigarette shaped devices are a multi-billion dollar industry overseas but in Australia they remain unregulated and legally contentious . Designed to reduce the harm of smoking, the battery-powered device simulate the effects of smoking by heating a nicotine liquid into vapour and gives smokers a nicotine hit without producing smoke. But long-time tobacco opponent from Sydney University Professor, Simon Chapman told ABC that describing e-cigarettes as a medicine was 'Orwellian' and destructive to society. 'That's the only word I can think [of] that's apposite here,' he said.

Tobacco giant British American has been lobbying Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration to allow them to sell e-cigarettes at any corner stores . The cigarette shaped devices are a multi-billion dollar industry overseas . Nicoventures, owned by British American Tobacco first sought a meeting with the Therapeutic Goods Administration in November 2013 'to fully explain our medicines-based approach to these agencies', according to ABC. After the meeting was confirmed for December 2013, the company claimed it was motivated by protecting smokers' health. 'Thanks again for making time to see us, this is an area of much focus globally and we are committed to bringing these products to market and so reducing the harm caused by smoking in the population,' the letter said.

'If smoking cessation products can achieve a greater acceptance among smokers by offering craving relief, coupled with rapid absorption and mimicking many aspects of a cigarette ... they will enable a greater proportion of the smoking population to begin their journey towards quitting or substitution of cigarettes with medicinal nicotine products.'

"The Syrian Electronic Army and celebrity prank group Exposed have both been linked to hoaxes against the Associated Press and the White House. A group of Syrian hackers claimed responsibility for hacking the AP twitter account yesterday afternoon and posting a false report about explosions at the White House. Meanwhile in a separate prank, Exposed, the group behind most major celebrity swatting, is reported to have claimed responsibility for a 911 bomb threat hoax phone call directed at the White House. But today sources close to the investigation have told TMZ that both groups are linked and have members working for both operations. Hacked: This terrifying report of explosions at the White House injuring President Obama has been deemed false after the Associated Press said they had been hacked . The message 'Breaking: Two . Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured,' was tweeted . from the Associated Press news agency, causing panic to some of their . near 2 million followers. Meanwhile Exposed reportedly made a hoax call pretending to threaten to detonate eight devices around the White House if President Obama does not declare war against North Korea within 24 hours, according to TMZ. Exposed responsible for exposing private financial information about Michelle Obama, Beyonce, Jay-Z, Britney Spears, Donald Trump and Kim Kardashian. After yesterday's fake tweet the White House and AP assured the . public minutes later that the report was not true but word didn't appear . to come fast enough to those frantically watching and responding on Wall Street. New target? Exposed, the group behind exposing private financial information about Michelle Obama and Kim Kardashian reportedly made a hoax call pretending to threaten to bomb the White House . All safe: White House Press Secretary Jay Carney also told the media on Tuesday that the President is fine . The White House was the latest media company to be targeted by the Syrian Electronic Army which says it is ‘supporting the Syrian people against #FSA (Free Syrian Army) terrorism’. Two days ago the SEA claimed responsibility for hacking the Twitter accounts of FIFA president Sepp Blatter and the official FIFA World Cup account. On its website, available in Arabic and English, the SEA declares states it is 'supporting the cause of the Syrian Arab people by armaments with science and knowledge against the campaigns led by the Arab media and Western on our Republic by broadcasting fabricated news about what is happening in Syria.' In the past few months the hacking group has been particularly active. There are reports it may have been launched in retaliation to the hacking of private Assad family emails, which were released to the media in early 2012. Last month several official BBC Twitter accounts were hacked by the SEN. It sent a series of tweets from the accounts, including several with anti-Israeli sentiments on the day that U.S. President Barack Obama visited the country. Others targeted in the past include . the Agence France-Presse agency, whose @AFPphoto account was taken over . in February and images purporting to be from the warzone in Syria were . posted. The group has previously claimed . credit for hacking the Twitter and Facebook accounts of Sky News Arabia, . Al-Jazeera Mobile, German Deutsche Welle, France 24 and Israeli . newspaper Haaretz. Yesterday they It is thought they use . SEA used fairly simple phishing attacks via emails - recipients are . asked to click on a link in order to access their password. The prank plunged the DOW Jones . Industrial average more than 100 points and the Standard & Poor's . 500 to lose $136.5 billion. In a graph capturing traders' apparent panic, the DOW Jones Industrial average took a straight dive plunging from about 14,700 to around 14,570 before gradually shooting back up in a three-minute roller coaster. The S&P 500 Index also fell about 1 percent, wiping out $136.5 billion before gradually recovering their loses, . according to Reuters data. Amid the hysteria the volume of trading on the New York Stock Exchange blew up to an intra-day high of 3.06 million. The alarming message by the AP appeared retweeted at least 1,181 times before its deletion. Both the DOW Jones and the S&P regained their previous levels following word of the news agency's hacking minutes later. An editor with the AP wrote: 'Please ignore AP tweet on explosions, we've been hacked.' 'The President is fine, I was just with him,' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney also told the media. The Syrian Electronic Army, celebrated on their Facebook wall the impact made on stock . prices. The AP has since temporarily suspended . their main Twitter account as well as their mobile Twitter account, both . of which they say were hacked. The attack was preceded by a phishing attempt on their corporate network, the news agency said. At the time of their Tweet they had a reported following of 1,905,403. Some traders blamed automatic electronic . trading for the sharp fall and recovery and not human reaction to the report. 'No human believed the story. Only . the computers react to something that serious disseminated in such a . way. I bought some stock well and did not sell into it. Humans win,' Rick Fier, director of equity trading at Conifer Securities LLC in New . York, overseeing $8 billion in assets, told Bloomberg. Jonathan .

Billions gone: Similarly seen the S&P 500 dropped about 1 percent wiping out $136.5 billion before almost as quickly recovering from their losses amid the scare . 'He did not know what I was talking about,' Corpina, who's a senior managing partner with Meridian Equity Partners Inc. told Bloomberg Radio. ]'He said I’m staring at the White House and there’s nothing going on here right now.' He also partially blamed algorithmic trading programs that react to certain headlines. 'It puts into perspective our . increasing dependence on technology and communications,' said Bill . Baruch, senior market strategist at iiTRADER.com remarking on Twitter's . impact on the stock market. 'As . we put more and more trust in technology for our communications, it . brings us back to reality in the sense that these communications are . easily misconstrued, easily hacked, so not only can people put out false . information, but they can capitalize on it,' he said. Hackers: A group claiming responsibility for the hacking posted this apparent screen grab taken from their computer showing their infiltration . The AP is the latest media organization to come under siege from hackers in a spate of high profile incidents over the past several months. The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal said their systems were hacked, prompting the White House and lawmakers to push through legislation that will help better defend against cyber attacks. Reuters News said in August one of its Twitter accounts was hacked and false tweets were posted, mainly related to the armed struggle in Syria. The bogus report of explosions in the heart of Washington, D.C. comes eight days after the Boston Marathon bombings that killed three people and wounded more than 200 others.","Syrian hackers claimed responsibility for hacking Associated Press twitter .

"A 200-year-old mystery that links a castle in a German town, a mysterious 'Dark Countess' and the French royal family may be on the cusp of finally being solved. In 1807 a covered carriage arrived in the central German town of Hildburghausen. A man, now known to be Leonardus Cornelius van der Valck, a secretary in the Dutch embassy in Paris from July 1798 to April 1799, got out. With him was an enigmatic and secretive young woman who would go on to fire the imaginations of historians everywhere. End of the mystery? A digger clears the earth during the exhumation of the grave of so-called 'Dark Countess' in Hildburghausen, Germany . Known as the 'Dark Countess', many believed she was none other than Marie Thérèse Charlotte de Bourbon - daughter of the French King Louis XVI and his wife, Marie Antoinette, who were executed during the French Revolution. Rarely seen in public and always veiled, she lived under the protection of the Duke and Duchess of Saxony- Hildburghausen in castle of Eishausen. Now a team of archaeologists, supported by Central German Radio, may be about to shed light on a secret that has gone unsolved for more than two centuries. The grave is being opened to find out if it contains the remains of 'Madame Royale', the French Princess Marie Therese who was said to be the sole surviving member of the French royal family after the revolution in 1789 . Resting place: Michael Roemhild, director of the local municipal museum, holds what are believed to be pieces of the coffin and nails during the exhumation . They are exhuming her grave to collect DNA evidence that can prove once and for all whether the Dark Countess was in fact the ill-fated princess. Princess Marie Thérèse, pictured around the time she left France . After her parents were guillotined Marie Thérèse was imprisoned in the 'Temple', a notorious former fortress used as a prison during the Reign of Terror. Accepted historical dogma is that afterwards she was taken to Vienna, the capital city of her cousin, the Holy Roman Emperor Francis II, and also her mother's birthplace. It was speculated that she would have refused to rejoin society after her traumatic time in the Temple, where it is rumoured she was subjected to cruelties by the guards - and perhaps even pregnant from rape - and was replaced by Ernestine Lambriquet, her half-sister and childhood companion. The Count gave her name as Sophie Botta, a single woman from Westphalia and refused to confirm what the relationship between the pair was. When she died in November 1837 she was quickly buried, possibly without a religious service, intensifying the speculation. A physician said she appeared to be around 60 years old when she died- which would match the age of Marie Thérèse. 'I am personally convinced that the Madame Royale , the French king's daughter, is buried here,' said Mayor Hildburghausen Harz Steffen, reports Die Welt. He welcomes the grave opening, but many residents want to prevent it to maintain the air of mystery surrounding a tale that would not look out of place in a Dan Brown novel. Central German Radio has sought to allay those fears and say the project will be respectful. 'The grave of the Dark Countess and the remains will be treated with the utmost care and with due regard for piety and dignity,' said editor Eva Hempel .","Mysterious woman arrived in Hildburghausen in 1807 and lived in castle .

Nigel Farage, the fiercely eurosceptic UKIP leader, has urged Britain to get behind 'Team Europe' in the Ryder Cup . The video, which is described as a ‘party political broadcast for Paddy Power', Mr Farage pays tribute to ‘the wine, the food, the excellent transport systems, the clogs, and the greatest golfers in the world’. He pokes fun at the US side’s Hunter Mahan, Bubba Watson, and Webb Simpson over their names. Mr Farage said: ‘They’re not names, they’re just noises’. He also takes a pop at Tiger Woods’ back injury – which he claims was sustained ‘carrying the hopes of a nation’.

"Kim Jong-un's dictatorial regime in North Korea could be teetering on the edge of collapse - at least according to Chinese military chiefs, who have drawn up plans for how to deal with the end of his reign. Chinese soldiers would capture the leaders of the North Korean government, set up their own refugee camps for displaced citizens and step up border patrols should the regime totter, according to leaked documents. Strategists from the People's Liberation Army in China explain in the plans how they would gather up key figures from Kim Jon-un's Workers' Party of Korea, as well as the leaders of the Korean army, should unrest break out. Scroll down for video . Teetering? Kim Jon-un, pictured with members of his military, could be detained in a Chinese camp if his regime collapses, according to leaked documents . China - which remains North Korea's only major ally - would offer the leaders their protection, but only while detaining them in camps where they could not lead Korean forces or make trouble for the Chinese, according to the plans. 'Detained': The plans say North Korean leaders would be protected from foreign powers, but prevented from leading and military operations . They outline concerns that a 'military power' - thought to be the U.S. - could attempt to target the key personnel, which detaining the leaders would seek to prevent. The secret documents detailing the plans were leaked to the Japanese media, and imagine a scenario in which 'foreign forces' bring about the collapse of the North Korean government, according to the Telegraph. This, the Chinese army fears, could in turn lead to a mass exodus as millions try to escape across the border between North Korea and China, which spans almost 900 miles. According to the plans, China would adopt a tough system of immigration checks along the border, in which new arrivals would be interrogated and have their identities scrutinised. Any known agitators would be turned away. In response to the revelation, a foreign policy expert has warned that the leaking of the documents could be a sign that China thinks the end is coming soon. Jun Okumura, of the Meiji Institute for Global Affairs, pointed out that China has probably had some kind of contingency plan for decades, but only chose to allow it to be released now. He added: 'What we have learned from the collapse of other dictatorships – the Soviet Union, Muammar Gaddafi’s Libya – is that the more totalitarian the regime, the harder and faster they fall.'

"A western Pennsylvania coroner is auctioning off about 100 guns used in suicides and accidental shooting deaths. Corner Ken Bacha says the November 8 surplus weapons sale is Westmoreland County government's first since his father Leo Bacha was coroner in the 1980s . He says state law requires local governments sell off unclaimed property. Proceeds will help fund county government. Sinister sale: Those wishing to own a gun used in a suicide or accidental shooting can buy one in Pennsylvania . Bacha's office took possession of the guns during death investigations. Family members had a year to get them back before they became county property. Some of the weapons have been in the county's hands for decades. Bacha says guns were used in 34 of the 55 suicides in the county last year. No weapons used in homicides are being auctioned off. They're kept in storage for use as evidence. WTAE reports that as the auction date gets closer the coroner and auctioneer are seeing a growing interest. 'Now as we are a week and a half away, we're getting more phone calls, several today. I talked to the auctioneer earlier today, and he's getting a lot of hits to his website and a lot of calls to his office as well,' Bacha said. 'I know when my dad had the auction in the 80s, there were guns that were valued at $100 brand new that were selling for $200. Was it just the novelty of it, that this gun took a life? I'm not really sure.' Bacha made sure to say that none of the guns were used in homicides. 'Most of these firearms that are going to be auctioned are non-homicide firearms, meaning accidental deaths, but most of them are suicides,'Bacha said. Bacha added that guns often go for more than the going price because of the 'novelty' and story behind their use.

"A group of schoolchildren has beaten the land speed record for a rocket-powered car, twice over, after their vehicles hit speeds of over 500mph (800km/h). The young engineers from Nottinghamshire beat the existing record of 287mph (460km/h) set in March by Samvir Thandi of The Heathland School in Middlesex. In total, the group put three car designs through their paces at a testing track in Hucknall - and all three were able to reach speeds in excess of 440mph (708km/h). Scroll down for video . A group of school children have smashed a land speed record twice for rocket-powered cars after their model vehicles hit speeds of over 500mph (800km/h). Pictured is the Redshift model . The cars were each built by students at the Joseph Whitaker School, in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, and were called Redshift, Bloodhound and Insanity. They were tested at the Royce track in Hucknall. Redshift reached speeds of 478.1mph (769.4km/h), and Bloodhound followed with a speed of 448.9mph (722.4km/h) – and then Insanity took to the track. The car managed 509.83mph (820.49km/h) on its first run, then recorded 556.28mph (895.25km/h) on its second.

The world record was broken on a 4.2km circular race track in Geelong - south-west of Melbourne - in Victoria at the Australian Automotive Research Centre in July. The vehicle called eVe was the fifth one built and raced by Sunswift since the team was founded in 1996. Teacher Phil Worsley said: 'The weather was horrific early on Saturday morning but then eventually the sun came out and we were away. 'We're actually going to get two certificates from the Guinness Book of Records because we broke our own new record and the whole school is absolutely buzzing. 'We started with buying simple rocket kits, building them and firing them into the sky - then developed our ideas from there.

"Spending Christmas on a Caribbean island is not without its problems, it seems. Take, for instance, the example of one British family who mid-way through preparing their festive feast, realised they had forgotten to pack the all-important cranberry sauce. Thankfully, after scouring the island in vain to try and find somewhere that sold the condiment, they were able to call on the services of a VIP courier service who immediately dispatched a jar of the sauce from London in time for their Christmas day dinner. London-based courier company First Luggage delivered a jar of cranberry sauce to the Caribbean after a family who were spending Christmas Day on an island forgot to pack their favourite condiment . It is just one example of the unusual assignments undertaken by First Luggage – a London-based delivery company that prides itself on being able to transport  luggage to its clients in the world’s most unlikely destinations. From delivering supplies to Mount Everest and football paraphernalia to President Obama in the White House, to sending BBC camera equipment to the remotest parts of Italy, First Luggage say they manage a range of weird and wonderful requests on a daily basis. Each week, the door-to-door company delivers hundreds of holidaymakers’ bags to destinations around the world. Sports personalities, celebrities and VIPs are also among those who rely on their services. One of the biggest items they were asked to deliver was a circus big top from the UK to Angola in Africa . Celebrating its 10th year in business, First Luggage is now lifting the lid on some of its more unusual deliveries. Following extensive UK floods in early 2014, two Surrey newlyweds were left without their suitcase which had been lost underwater. After being rushed to the airport by boat, local police retrieved the case after it was seen floating past the police station. When the couple were informed, they immediately contacted First Luggage, who, with permission from the couple, dried out the contents, including a wedding dress, and then delivered it to them on their honeymoon. Supplies and climbing equipment were also shipped to Everest base camp in 2013, where two British climbers were attempting to scale the summit of the world’s highest mountain . First Luggage came to the rescue when the BBC team needed camera equipment sent to one of the remotest parts of Tuscany in Italy, to film a recent series of the MasterChef . The company once sent a showerproof prosthetic leg sent from the UK to Canada, while one of the biggest items they were asked to deliver was a circus big top from UK to Angola. First Luggage came to the rescue when the BBC team needed camera equipment sent to one of the remotest parts of Tuscany in Italy, to film a recent series of the MasterChef, and the firm even couriered a large collection of sex toys from the US to southern France. 1. Supplies to Mt Everest: In spring 2013, First Luggage was called upon to deliver equipment for a British expedition to Everest in Kathmandu. The two British climbers were aiming for the summit . 2. Soaking Suitcases: Following extensive UK floods in early 2014, two Surrey newlyweds were left without their honeymoon suitcase as they were rescued by boat before rushing to the airport.

"Sol Campbell has put his London home on the market for a whopping £25million - just days after slamming the proposed mansion tax. The ex-England star called the controversial levy a 'cheap and easy way to extract money from individuals who have done well' just over two weeks ago. Campbell, 40, is now selling his Thames-side six-bedroom home in London, which overlooks the river and the stunning Albert Bridge. Scroll down for video . Ex-footballer Sol Campbell (left, with wife Fiona) is selling a property (right) just weeks after he attacked the proposed mansion tax . The beautiful Thames-side home, on the market for £25million, is in the exclusive Cheyne Walk in Chelsea, south-west London . It offers beautiful views over the famous river and of the nearby Albert Bridge, which crosses the Thames next to Battersea Park . The property has five bathrooms, a drawing room, library, dining room and a separate mews home at the rear. It underwent a renovation in 2008 with Campbell's wife, Fiona Barrett-Campbell, designing the interior. The listed home has 7,224 sq/ft of space and also features a lift, 45ft garden and an underground tunnel which links the main home and the mews property at the rear. Campbell has now put it up for sale with the John D. Wood estate agency for £25million. A spokesman for the agency has declined to discuss the property, which is also available to rent through Knight Frank for £15,000 a week. It comes onto the market less than a month after the ex-Arsenal defender's stinging criticism of the proposed mansion tax. The property - which has six bedrooms, five bathrooms - was renovated in 2008 by Campbell's wife, Fiona Barrett-Campbell . It also features a 'mews house' at the end of the garden, which is connected to the main property by an underground tunnel . It is estimated Campbell would have to pay £250,000 'mansion tax' on the property if the proposal ever became law . Setting out the idea, Labour leader Ed Miliband has said that owners of properties worth more than £2millon would face an annual charge in future. Under the proposed tax, Campbell would have to pay an estimated £250,000 per year on his property to the government. In an extraordinary series of tweets last month, Campbell launched a scathing attack on the idea and the Labour party. He wrote: '#MansionTax? Why should we except this? @UKLabour are the grim reaper of business entrepreneurs or anyone that has done well! 'Some people only have their houses to support their incomes, some have been lucky or have risked a lot with their properties. 'They don't trust bankers or the stocks and shares market and now labour want to penalise everyone with a £2million+ home!' In an angry series of tweets last month, Campbell - whose home has a 45-feet garden (pictured) - attacked the idea of a mansion tax . He branded Labour 'the grim reaper of business' for suggesting the idea and proclaimed: 'An Englishman's home is his castle!' The property, on the market with John D. Wood estate agency, is also available to rent through Knight Frank for £15,000 a week . Former couple: Sol Campbell with his former girlfriend, interior designer Kelly Hoppen, in April 2004 . He added: 'This Tax on homes is a cheap & easy way to extract money from individuals that have done well! Does @UKLabour want to kill the top market? 'They talk about rolling the tax up when you sell your home! We already have stamp duty which has gone up, capital gains tax, death duties.' He went on: 'Suggestion: separate & flexible council tax linked to actual earning; if you earn a lot you pay more, if not working you pay very little? 'Think out of the box @UKLabour. Don't go back, look forward. An Englishman's home is his castle, there will be uproar with this tax! 'Look after the needy and embrace the people and companies who make this country great! Listen to @George_Osborne @Conservatives last night!' Campbell once dated interior designer Kelly Hoppen, but he then become involved with her protégée, the then-Fiona Barratt, who had worked for Miss Hoppen for three years. In July 2010, he married Miss Barratt - who left Miss Hoppen's firm where she had become head of interior design to set up her own firm in May 2006. Interestingly, Campbell had commissioned Miss Hoppen to design his Chelsea town house - a job which subsequently went to his wife following the split.","Former Tottenham and Arsenal player attacked Labour's idea of taxing property in series of tweets last month .

"Former New york Mayor Rudy Giuliani joined Jewish and disabled protestors camped outside the New York Metropolitan Opera at the premiere of 'The Death of Klinghoffer' last week which tells the story of four Palestinian hijackers who brought terror to the Achille Lauro cruise ship in the Mediterranean in 1985. The slick production has been criticized for glamorising terrorism in its portrayal of the infamous atrocity in which the terrorists murdered an elderly disabled American Jewish passenger, Leon Klinghoffer in full view of many of the American and British passengers on board. They then threw his blood-stained body - still in his wheelchair - overboard. Scroll down for video . Infamy: The hijacking of the notorious 1985 hijacking of the Achille Lauro has been made into an opera that sparked protests when it was staged at the New York Metropolitan Opera last week . Anger: The slick production has been criticized for glamorising terrorism in its portrayal of the infamous atrocity in which the terrorists executed an elderly disabled American Jewish passenger, Leon Klinghoffer in full view of the passengers on board. They then threw his body - still in his wheelchair - overboard . The hijackers threatened to execute more passengers if their demands to release 50 Palestinian terrorists held in Israeli jails were not met. But what the opera fails to explain is one of the true motives behind the Achille Lauro attack - and why one prisoner in particular was of key significance. Abu Abbas, the murderous leader of the Palestinian Liberation Front - the terror group behind the hijacking - was determined to make Israel release Samir Kuntar. His was the only name specified by the hijackers. Kuntar, a Lebanese citizen and a friend of Abbas, had been jailed five years earlier by the Israelis for one of the most horrendous and notorious acts in Israel's history. Kuntar and an accomplice launched an attempted kidnapping of a Jewish family in Israel which resulted in the horrific deaths of a young father and two young daughters. Wife and mother, Smadar Haran Kaiser, was the only survivor after the raid on the fateful night of April 22, 1979, in Nahariya, in northern Israel, close to the Lebanese border. Smadar wrote in 2003: 'It was a murder of unimaginable cruelty, crueler even than the murder of Leon Klinghoffer, the American tourist who was shot on the Achille Lauro and dumped overboard in his wheelchair.' When the family heard the men approaching their apartment, Smadar grabbed her two-year-old daughter, Yael, and managed to hide with her in a ceiling loft space. Her 31-year-old husband, Danny, and her elder daughter Einat, four, tried to run to an underground shelter but were caught by the intruders. The terrorists, who had already killed a policeman en route from the beach where they had landed in an inflatable dinghy, began searching for mother and daughter. Horror: Danny, Einat and Yael Haran were killed in a botched kidnapping in Nahariya, Israel, at the hands of  terrorists in 1979. The killings are still seen as one of the worst episodes in the country's history . Dirty deal: Abu Abbas, the murderous leader of the Palestinian Liberation Front - the terror group behind the Achille Lauro hijacking - was determined to make Israel release Samir Kuntar - who killed the family . Survivor: Smadar Haran Kaiser, Danny's wife and mother to the two girls, told MailOnline that she was upset that the Death of Klinghoffer does not reference in any way the horror her family endured . In a bid to avoid being caught, Smadar hushed Yael's cries by putting her hand over her terrified little girl's mouth and the attackers failed to locate them overhead. Danny and Einat were taken away by Kuntar to the beach. But the alarm had been raised and the police were in hot pursuit. Kuntar abandoned any hope of returning with hostages. According to eyewitnesses, Danny was shot in front of Einat - so the last thing she would see was her father being murdered. Then Kuntar killer her by smashing her skull against a rock with a rifle butt. The postscript to the awful events of that night was no less shocking. In Smadar's own words: 'By the time we were rescued from the crawl space, hours later, Yael, too, was dead. In trying to save all our lives, I had smothered her.' The next day Abu Abbas, who planned the attack with Kuntar - who was caught that night - said it had been done 'to protest the signing of the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty at Camp David' seven months earlier. Writing in the Washington Post in 2003, Smadar said: 'Kuntar's mission against my family, which never made world headlines, was also masterminded by Abu Abbas. 'And my wish now is that this terrorist leader should be prosecuted in the United States, so that the world may know of all his terrorist acts, not the least of which is what he did to my family.' Her pleas went unheeded. Despite his violent terrorist past and the efforts of many intelligence agencies to apprehend him, Abu Abbas was never brought to account for his many acts of terrorism. As part of the 1993 Oslo Accords treaty between Israel and the Palestinians, he was controversially allowed to move freely around the Middle East as a representative of the Palestine National Council. He spent some years in Gaza before moving to Iraq where he reportedly became the conduit through which Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein – a sworn enemy of Israel – paid $25,000 bounties to the family of each Palestinian suicide bomber who killed Israelis. Brutal: Kuntar, seen here being arrested after the murders, shot Danny dead on a beach and then killed Einat by smashing her head against a rock with a rifle butt. Meanwhile, Smadar had tragically smothered Yael to death as she held her hand over her mouth to stifle the girl's screams as they hid in a crawl space in their home . Senseless: Kuntar and his accomplice had landed on the Israeli beach with the aim of kidnapping the family in an operation masterminded by Abu Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Liberation Front . Haunted: Evidence from the pathologist's report showing that Einat's brain tissue was found on the rifle butt . Abbas was captured by US forces in Iraq in 2003 and reportedly died a year later, while still in custody, of natural causes. Despite an outcry in Israel against the decision, Kuntar was released from prison five years later in 2008, returning to a hero's welcome in Lebanon - where he was met at the airport by both the Lebanese president and prime minister - while, not to be outdone, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad granted him the Syrian Order of Merit. He remains a free man. The awful events of that 1979 night still shock more than 35 years later, but are apparently not presented nor referenced in any way in 'The Death of Klinghoffer', to the dismay of Smadar. The key, sickening event that specifically inspired the hijacking - and might have put it into proper even more grotesque context – is absent from the production. This week, Smadar, now in her 60s, still living in Naharia, and who some years ago re-married and has two adult daughters from her second marriage, spoke to MailOnline. Smadar, who is now a clinical social worker who cares for Jewish and Arab children in her mixed community in the Galilee, has not seen 'The Death of Klinghoffer'. But she expresses concern at the glaring omission of the truly horrific catalyst to the story – her story - which they fail to mention at any point. 'These days I see that everybody is trying to simplify everything without making people have to think too much,' Smadar said. 'They take anything that is controversial, or that will grab attention, and portray everything as black and white... like in the news coverage connected to the very complicated issue between us [Israelis] and the people around us, including the Palestinians.' 'The opera appears to be yet another easy way to show things in a superficial way; simplified, very basic, without looking at the background in enough depth. It surprises me that they’re doing an opera about it. I ask myself, “What is the connection to opera?” It's very strange.' 'I saw the demonstrations on the news,' she continues. 'I ask myself if it has an anti-Semitic message, anti-Jewish, or anti-Israeli, or if we're over-sensitive.' She pauses then wonders out loud: 'I just don't know, but it might be that the bigger picture might have ruined their story.' Outrage: Abu Abass, left, was never brought to justice and Samir Kuntar, right, was freed in 2008 . She offers a final thought for those considering enjoying a night at the opera by taking in 'The Death of Klinghoffer'. 'They need to understand that Samir Kuntar, the one that was supposed to be released [by the hijacking of the Achille Lauro], was a cold-blooded murderer that acted against an innocent family at night. There's nothing heroic, or brave about that.'","Death of Klinghoffer opera drew protests when staged at NY Metropolitan opera last week.

"Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling, who was banned for life from the National Basketball Association after a tape of his racist comments became public, claimed in a new recording he was not a bigot, according to an online report on Thursday. The entertainment news blog Radar Online said it obtained a tape from an anonymous source who provided an affidavit confirming the voice was that of the 80-year-old Sterling. 'You think I'm a racist?' Radar Online quoted Sterling as saying on what it reported was a secretly recorded phone conversation. 'You think I have anything in the world but love for everybody? You don't think that! You know I'm not a racist!' Lies: Donald Sterling claims he is not a bigot after being found guilty of racist remarks by the NBA in April . Radar Online included the recording in its report. Reuters could not independently confirm it was Sterling's voice on the recording. Last month the NBA fined Sterling $2.5 million and banned him from pro-basketball after the website TMZ.com posted an audio recording with a voice said to be his that made derogatory remarks about black people. Express yourself: Clippers' fans made their views clear towards Sterling and his reported comments . The comments sparked outrage from players fans as well as U.S. President Barack Obama, especially since Sterling was a team owner in a league that was in the forefront of racial integration in U.S. sports. Sterling has yet to comment publicly. He could not be reached immediately on Thursday. The NBA has initiated the process to terminate Sterling's ownership. 'How can you be in this business and be a racist?' Sterling said on the tape, according to Radar Online. 'Do you think I tell the coach to get white players? Or to get the best player he can get?' Ardent fan: Shelly Sterling (left) wants to retain her 50 per cent share in the Clippers according to her attorney . The Los Angeles Times reported on Wednesday that Shelly Sterling, Donald's wife and co-owner of the Clippers, said she intended to remain an owner of the team and has hired a law firm to represent her as the NBA moves to terminate her husband's ownership. Mrs Sterling's attorney Pierce O'Donnell said that she will fight to retain her 50 percent ownership stake in the NBA team. O'Donnell also added that Sterling, who is considering a divorce, ""abhors"" the comments and has been separated from her husband for the last year. Deadlock: The Clippers are currently tied 1-1 in their Western Conference play-offs semi-final vs Oklahoma . O'Donnell said she was an ardent Clippers fan and planned to attend Friday's play-off game against Oklahoma City Thunder. In 1981 Mr Sterling purchased the Clippers, which were based in San Diego, for $12.5 million. The team is now estimated to be worth at least $575 million, according to Forbes, which compiles a list of professional sports team values each year. The Clippers are currently tied with the Oklahoma City Thunder in the second round of the NBA playoffs at one game a piece. Their next match is scheduled for Friday.

"Lost: Eric Sinacori, 20, was a junior at UMass Amherst on a scholarship, but at the same time was struggling with abuse problems . It was the father and step-mother of a UMass Amherst junior that first discovered his lifeless body next to a needle and syringe in the bathroom. While the parents say they had no idea 20-year-old Eric Sinacori even had a heroin problem, university police had found a hypodermic needle after catching him dealing club drugs months before. But instead of arresting him or informing the family, UMass police turned him into an informant, then cut him loose  to continue down his fatal path. 'You’re always looking to move up the ladder and get an individual that is more of a threat to our community,' UMass Police Chief John Horvath told the Boston Globe. UMass announced Tuesday it is now suspending its confidential informant program and thoroughly reviewing it. A memorial scholarship was set up in Sinacori's memory, and family members and friends remember Sinacori, who played high school hockey in his home state of New Jersey and attended UMass thanks to a significant scholarship, as a passionate young man. The university first became interested in his drug habits after another confidential informant told police he was dealing Molly, the powdered form of MDMA, which is the active ingredient in ecstasy. A university officer, with the help of a Drug Enforcement Agency agent, arranged two buys of Molly and LSD off Sinacori late in 2012. After the officer revealed his identity, Sinacori worried that his world was about to come crumbling down. But campus police made him an 'offer I couldn't refuse,' as he put it in a text message to a friend, in exchange for becoming an informant. Sinacori took $80 from the undercover officer and bought LSD off of another suspected drug dealer in the dorm. Both the dealer and another student in the room were arrested on drug charges and suspended. Unaware: UMass Amherst, where Eric Sinacori, 20, died of acute heroin intoxication as a junior living in an off-campus apartment . But Sinacori walked free. In return for complying, he faced no criminal charges and no academic sanctions. He kept his merit-based scholarship and his parents were kept in the dark. Dec 8, 2012 - Eric: Anyone with anything going for them would do the same..and for te record all [person] had was a couple strips on him. Friend: [Expletive] man, I can't say I fully agree but I'm glad you told me the truth. So does that mean you're not in trouble at all? No fines, suspension from school, or anything like that . Eric: Nah dude nothing. Which is the only reason I did it., I have to live with this [expletive] which really really sucks but it is what it is. Iit was either give my friend up who was already under heavy investigation or go to jail for 5 years and be done for life..such a [expletive] up lose lose situation that ill never be able to forget ya know . Friend: Yeah that's true. I take it you're done selling anything . Eric: I'm def takin a break and if I do start again ill be super careful and def not be as big as I was. Burner phone and [expletive] haha . Police even returned $700 in cash that had been seized from Sinacori's dorm. The only thing they kept was a hypodermic needle. Oct 3 - Eric: [Expletive] my veins are crying...is the traffic gonna be bad? Alleged dealer: I know you’re hurting but you will very soon be in the loving comforting arms of Miss H . Oct 27 - Eric: You killed my son you [expletive] bastard. I hope you live a life of [expletive] hell and are as haunted as you've made me for the rest of your miserable [expletive] life [name]. You will rot in hell! Horvath told the Boston Globe that the needle did not definitely point to heroin use, especially when none of the drug was found in the dorm and the student denied having a problem. Sinacori's mother Francesca believed officers missed an opportunity to intervene. 'If you find a needle on my kid, you have to assume it’s heroin. And if it’s heroin, you have to say something,' she said. 'Because that’s the drug that kills everybody.' Drug and alcohol policy at UMass normally stipulates that a student's parents be called after the first violation. An exception is made for the confidential informant program. At the time, the student was already struggling with drug abuse. Text messages obtained by the Boston Globe showed Sinacori days before the bust trying to buy heroin to ease the painful symptoms of withdrawal. But the family also missed the signs, having seen Sinacori get arrested for cocaine when he was still a teenager, but believing it was an isolated incident. He seemed to kick drugs the summer after the bust, but relapsed later in the year. On the night of his death, he was texting with someone driving to deliver heroin who had gotten stuck on traffic on the way. 'My veins are crying,' read one message. Baggies of heroin labeled Tropicana were dropped off. Sinacori went inside to shoot up. He didn't respond to follow up texts asking about the drug's effects, and hours later he was dead. Eric's mother later texted the alleged dealer angrily from Logan's phone, ending by saying, 'You will rot in hell!' As UMass evaluates its informant program, it struggles to understand how its student body gets hard drugs onto the university. Review: UMass Amherst Chancellor Kumble Subbaswamy says the university has suspended the confidential informant program and will review it . Though officers said they couldn't remember the last heroin arrest, Horvath admits 'there may be an underlying heroin problem that we’re unaware of.' A former student now in detox, Maddie Schnier, 22, said it was 'ridiculous' how easy it was to obtain. '“If someone needed heroin I would be like, ""come for a drive with me. I’ll take you.""'","Eric Sinacori, 20, was caught dealing club drug Molly and LSD by campus police in 2012 .

"An eleventh grader in Texas was thrown in jail - just for missing school. However, honour student Diane Tran, 17, is no lazy truant. In fact, she's quite the opposite. Since her parents divorced and left her and her two siblings, she has been the sole breadwinner and works two jobs to keep the family afloat. Scroll down for video . Devastated: Diane Tran, 17, has a criminal record and spent a night in jail after being charged with truancy. She works two jobs to support her family . Abandoned: Her parents divorced 'out of the blue' and left Tran and her two siblings to fend for themselves . Ms Tran said she works a full time job, a part-time job, and takes advancement and dual credit college level courses at Willis High School. '[I take] dual credit U.S. history, dual credit English literacy, college algebra, Spanish language AP,' she says of her impressive academic workload. However, the high-achiever cannot devote as much time as she would like to her schooling as she often misses an entire day, reports KHOU. Ms Tran says that her parents divorced 'out of the blue,' leaving her and her two siblings to fend for themselves. 'I always thought our family was happy,' she said. Now, it's up to Ms Tran to support her siblings, who include an older brother at Texas A&M University and a younger sister who lives with relatives. Honour student: Tran works a full time job, a part-time job and takes advancement and dual credit college level courses at Willis High School near Houston, Texas . Harsh: Judge Lanny Moriarty also ordered Tran to pay a $100 fine but others are asking that he shows leniency on the school girl . Local authorities are using Ms Tran's case to crackdown on truancy. Judge Lanny Moriarty ordered the exhausted student to pay a $100 fine and spend 24 hours in jail as a lesson. According to Texas state law, students who are absent from school without parental consent for three days in a four-week period or ten or more days in a six-month period are subject to prosecution. Parents of children who miss excessive amounts of school may also be prosecuted. 'If you let one [truant student] run loose, what are you gonna' do with the rest of 'em? Let them go too?' asked Judge Moriarty. He had warned her last month to stop missing her classes. Ms Tran's employer at the Waverly Manor wedding venue, where Tran works during the weekend, suggested that the authorities should 'help [the family], don't harm them'. Ms Tran also works full-time at a dry cleaners. Her co-worker and classmate Devin Hill told the network how hard her friend works. 'She goes from job to job, from school, she stays up 'til 7 o'clock in the morning to study' she said. On the homepage of the school's website, there is a warning to students to be vigilant about their attendance. 'Should a student have multiple unexcused absences and a pattern of failing to attend school regularly, the law is clear that the matter becomes the jurisdiction of the court system,' it states. However, locals are arguing that Ms Tran's case is unique and should be treated with more leniency. Ms Tran, in the meantime, is worried this could mar her future ambitions - she one day hopes to become a doctor.

"An entrepreneur has made $200,000 out of the tragedy of the Ebola outbreak by selling a domain using the virus' nameto a Russian marujuana company. Jon Schultz, who monitors a number of 'disease domains' from his home in Las Vegas, bought Ebola.com in 2008 for $13,500 and has been waiting for the moment to cash in. And this week that moment came, when a Russian firm called Weed Growth Fund bought the name for  $50,000 more than Schultz's initial asking price, reported business news website BusinesstoCommunity.com. Scroll down for video . The hemorrhagic fever, which has no proven cure, has killed more than 4,000 people in West Africa . Under terms of the deal Schultz received $50,000 cash and 19,192 shares in the company. It has not been revealed at this time how a company specializing in marijuana plans to use the Ebola.com domain purchase. The businessman also owns birdflu.com and H1N1.com, as well a domain for the deadly mosquito-borne disease Chikungunya and another for the Ebola-like Marburg virus. 'Ebola.com would be a great domain for a pharmaceutical company working on a vaccine or cure, a company selling pandemic or disaster-preparedness supplies, or a medical company wishing to provide information and advertise services,' Mr Schultz told CNBC before the sale. 'There could be many other applications as well. With so many people concerned about the disease, any advertisement referring people to Ebola.com should get an excellent response.' In an interview with the Washington Post, Mr Schultz said he felt that a six figure sum was more than reasonable for Ebola.com. 'According to our site meter, we're already doing 5,000 page views per day just by people typing in Ebola.com to see what's there,' he said. 'We're getting inquiries every day about the sale of it. I have a lot of experience in this sort of domain business, and my sense is that $150,000 is reasonable.' Mr Schultz, who also owns terror.com, PotassiumIodide.com and fukushima.com, appeared untroubled about the issue of making money from a human tragedy. The World Health Organization called the outbreak 'most severe acute health emergency in modern times' 'But you could say the same thing about doctors,' Schultz told the Washington Post. 'They can become very well-off treating very sick patients. 'Besides we have sacrificed a couple of thousands in parking page income to put up links about Ebola on the site. And people can also donate to Doctors Without Borders at the site.' The hemorrhagic fever, which has no proven cure, has killed more than 4,000 people in West Africa since an outbreak that began in March. The World Health Organization  called the outbreak 'most severe acute health emergency in modern times'. The risks of failing to contain Ebola in West Africa have come into sharp focus in the United States after the first patient diagnosed with the disease on U.S. soil, Thomas Eric Duncan, died last week. Erica Ollman Saphire, a professor at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego is hoping to find a cure for the deadly virus using 'crowdfunding' on the internet . Mr Schultz told the Washington Post he wants to sell the domain soon because he is worried something may 'ameliorate' the outbreak, diminishing Ebola's news value and the value of the domain. 'Ebola is either something that could become more of a problem, or it's something that could ameliorate and not be a big news story for that much longer,' he said. But the entrepreneur still has other domain's to fall back on should Ebola.com lose its value. 'Our domain, birdflu.com, is worth way more than Ebola.com. We're definitely holding onto that one for the event,' he said, referring to an outbreak he believes could be far bigger than Ebola. ZMappwas used to treat aid worker Dr. Kent Brantly (pictured). An appeal is hoping to raise money to speed up the research into the drugs . 'That one's airborne and Ebola would never go airborne in the United States like bird flu can.' In California, a different individual has also turned to the internet to raise money. But rather than capitalizing on the outbreak immunologist Erica Ollman Saphire is hoping to find a cure for the deadly virus. The professor at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego is hoping that Internet 'crowdfunding' will help provide the extra money needed to speed up the research. She is in charge of an international consortium developing the new anti-Ebola drugs that helped formulate the experimental ZMapp serum that used to treat two American aid workers who contracted Ebola in Liberia and recovered. Dr. Saphire posted an appeal on the Crowd Rise website  seeking at least $100,000 in contributions for purchasing equipment that will allow researchers to more quickly analyze blood samples of antibodies from survivors of the hemorrhagic fever. The appeal has so far raised nearly $17,500 in donations. The Scripps-led consortium was established with a $28 million grant from the National Institutes of Health, but the rapidly growing scope of its work has placed additional demands on limited resources. Specimens are being sent to Dr. Saphire's lab from around the world, 'but the number of samples outpaces the ability of her current equipment to process them', the website said in a message. ZMapp is a mix of three antibodies designed to bind to proteins of the Ebola virus, preventing it from replicating and triggering the immune response of infected cells. The compound was tested in monkeys, but there were no human trials of the serum before it was rushed to Atlanta to treat U.S. aid workers Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol after they became infected in Liberia in July. Both were ultimately cured, but doctors are unsure whether the ZMapp actually helped them.","Jon Schultz sold the name to Russian company Weed Growth Fund .

"The family of a girl whose toes were amputated by a Macy's escalator is suing the operating company. Juliana Valdez, then aged 10, was back-to-school shopping with her mother and brother at the store in Paramus, New Jersey, when her right  leg got trapped in the metal plates. A passer-by hit the emergency stop switch but the top of her foot was already stripped bare of skin, muscle, tendons and nerves. Crippled: Juliana Valdez, 11, has had 20 surgeries on her foot after getting it trapped in a Macy's escalator . Trauma: Her family is now launching a legal battle against the firm after more than a year of operations . When police arrived, they said, her leg had been pulled into the escalator up to mid-calf. Paramedics had to spend almost an hour extracting the child from the machinery. However, Macy's refused to terminate the contract with ThyssenKrupp Elevator America Inc. Since the incident in August 2013, the Germany-based firm, which operates in around 80 countries, has reportedly reaped more than $5.63 billion in sales. Juliana's parents Juan and Nora Valdez are now launching a six-count federal complaint against the firm, claiming they were third-party beneficiaries in the contract between the store and the company. 'Poor maintenance': Juliana's parents will argue the firm ThyssenKrupp had not properly check their machine . Mangled: Police said Juliana was pulled down to mid-calf by the escalator. This is the shoe she was wearing . Their daughter has had 20 surgeries, including a skin graft, and doctors amputated her second and pinky toes. A few days into her treatment, her kidneys also started to fail, according to Commercial Appeal. Dr Sanjeev Kaul, who treated Juliana at Hackensack University Medical Center, said  doctors removed dead tissue from her foot and cleaned bones that had been blackened by grease from the escalator. They made surgical holes in her eardrums to equalize pressure so she could be treated with oxygen under high pressure in a hyperbaric chamber to promote healing, Kaul said. Months of agony: She even suffered kidney failure in the hospital due to the stress and the trauma, medics said . Now, in a legal complaint, the Valdez family claim ThyssenKrupp was obliged 'to provide inspection, maintenance and repair services for the escalators.' That deal, they say, was breached by the careless failure to properly maintain the escalator. A judge will now consider their six-count federal complaint alleges negligent maintenance and repair of the escalator; negligence in Macy's supervision of inspector ThyssenKrupp; emotional distress; breach of contract;  and punitive damages. They also claimed loss of consortium - a breakdown of family relationship caused by the incident - but that was dismissed. Macy's will simultaneously pursue action against ThyssenKrupp.","Juliana Valdez, 10, was back-to-school shopping with her mother .

"A teenage girl who was given a ten percent chance of survival after a horrific accident has returned home and is set to attend school for the first time in months. Mathilda Vazille was struck by a car and flung into a brick wall at a notoriously dangerous intersection on Sydney's northern beaches in May of this year. The horrific crash - which took place on Warringah Road in Narraweena - left the 13-year-old in a coma and bedridden in hospital for many months following. 'The doctors and nurses had very little hope I would survive, and even if I did, I'd be completely brain damaged', Mathilda told The Daily Telegraph. Mathilda Vazille, 14, escaped death and serious brain damage after she was hit my a car and thrown into a brick wall earlier this year . However Mathilda, now 14, has made a miraculous recovery and will return to Stella Maris College this week, according to the newspaper. The crash took place when the teen and four of her friends were on the way to meet a group when their bus broke down. The girls are said to have got off the vehicle and walked as they were not far from their destination. Just days after the accident Bella Amato and Chiara Tisamo, who were right behind Mathilda when she was crossing Warringah Rd, revealed to Nine News the moment they witnessed their friend being hit. 'She kind of went about like three or four metres up in the air and flipped and she went head first and hit a brick fence,' Bella said. Friends Bella Amato and Chiara Tisamo were right behind Mathilda when she was crossing Warringah . This week the teenager will return to school after spending weeks in a coma after the accident and the months following in rigorous rehabilitation . 'I thought I was imagining everything and I looked at Chiara and just went like – ""did this happen?""'. The girls explained how they were crossing the road when the pedestrian lights turned from a clear green to a flashing red, but Mathilda carried on crossing. 'You just have that instinct to just keep running because she was so close to the path,' Chiara said. Meantime, Mathilda's father Francois was in Singapore when he was told about his daughter's accident. Mr Vazille described his trip back to Australia as 'the longest flight ever'. 'I didn't even know if she would still be alive when I got there,' he told The Daily Telegraph. The schoolgirl suffered a severe brain injury and was in an induced coma while at Randwick Children's Hospital. It took more than three weeks until she began to regain consciousness. The intersection is known to be dangerous and has been the scene of many accidents before it . Mathilda said the first thing she remembers after the accident was waking up in hospital thinking she was having a nightmare, and trying to bite herself so she would wake up. Following this she had to learn to breathe, speak, eat, and walk again during her intense four months of rehabilitation. Mr Vazille described his daughter's recovery as miraculous, while Mathilda is looking forward to returning to normal life. Though there's a long way to go still she hopes to be back to her old self within the next two years, and despite all the challenges Mathilda said she is happier and more appreciative of her life now.","Mathilda Vazille was hit by a car and flung into a wall in May of this year .

"If you’re planning a holiday it turns out you shouldn’t treat Sunday as a day of rest. New research from the Airlines Reporting Corp (ARC) suggests that the lowest fares are found on Sundays, regardless of the domestic or international destination. During the traditional Monday through Friday work week, tickets purchased on Tuesday were the best bargains. New research from the Airlines Reporting Corp (ARC) suggests that the lowest fares are found on Sundays . During the traditional Monday through Friday work week, Tuesday had the best bargains . This graph shows the average ticket price and advanced purchase days for US domestic flights . The findings were part of a study into nearly 130 million ticket purchases – worth an estimated £58bn ($98bn) – between January 2013 and July of this year. However, it only looked at tickets purchased from travel agents and satellite ticket printing offices, and did not include tickets purchased directly from airlines - a practice used by most consumers. With over six million US domestic flights purchased on Sundays during that 19-month period, the average price for a round-trip ticket amounted to £267 ($432). The average cost for a return flight to an international destination was £593 ($958) with over two million tickets purchased on Sundays.

ARC’s study revealed that the best deals for US domestic routes were found eight weeks before the date of departure, while the lowest fares for international destinations were found 24 weeks in advance. An ARC study conducted in 2012 found that the least expensive domestic tickets were purchased six weeks prior to departure. Chuck Thackston, managing director of enterprise information management at ARC, said: ‘This latest study by ARC is significant because it reveals that not only have the lowest airfares shifted from six to eight weeks out for domestic travel, but the savings are markedly greater on a percentage basis. The best deals for US domestic routes were found eight weeks before the date of departure . ‘It was also interesting to see that the data showed the least expensive tickets were purchased on a Sunday as opposed to Tuesday, which is a common belief.’ But he recommends people shop around and check prices every day as the best deals may not always be offered on a Sunday or Tuesday. ‘Air ticket pricing is dynamic and ARC isn't advising anyone to purchase tickets only at these times during the sales cycle as there is no guarantee they will receive the lowest price; it is just what the data pattern indicates during the study period.’","Airlines Reporting Corp study analysed nearly 130 million ticket purchases .

"The stock market had another turbulent session Friday, capping off one of the more eventful weeks on Wall Street in years — but at least the Dow Jones closed in an upward motion. The Dow Jones industrial average soared more than 250 points following strong earnings from Morgan Stanley, General Electric and Textron as well as some encouraging U.S. economic reports. It was the latest big move for a market which, with a few exceptions, has been on a mostly downward track. Stocks have had four weeks of declines, leaving the Standard & Poor's 500 index 6 percent below the record high it set Sept. 18. U.S. stocks opened higher Friday as investors weighed the latest corporate earnings news and data showing home construction picked up last month . The Dow Jones industrial average soared more than 250 points Friday, following strong earnings from Morgan Stanley, General Electric and Textron as well as some encouraging U.S. economic reports . Investors have been riding wild market swings for much of the week. The Dow Jones industrial average plunged as much as 460 points Wednesday, then had one of its best days of the year on Friday. 'We had indiscriminate selling all week, and then today we had indiscriminate buying,' said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. Market watchers have warned investors to expect more volatility than they have been used to in recent months, reflecting the heightened concerns about weaker growth in Europe and what it could mean for U.S. corporate profits, as well as plunging oil prices. The turmoil has not been limited to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Bonds, overseas stock markets and commodities prices have all had big moves this week. 'Most of the swings this week were related to fears about global growth and not about the fundamentals of this market,' said James Liu, global market strategist at JPMorgan Funds. The VIX, a measure of how much volatility investors expect in stocks, has risen from 12 in mid-September to as high as 31 this week, above its historical average of around 20. That's still far below the readings of 80 it had at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. 'This volatility, in a way, is purely psychological. This is the market returning to a more normalized behavior,' Liu said. U.S. stocks opened higher Friday as investors weighed the latest corporate earnings news and data showing home construction picked up last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 263.17 points, or 1.63 percent, following six consecutive days of loses . The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 263.17 points, or 1.6 percent, to 16,380.41 Friday. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 24 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,886.76 and the Nasdaq composite rose 41.05 points, or 1 percent, to 4,258.44. On Friday, investors rallied behind a group of corporate earnings results. General Electric rose 2.4 percent after the company reported third-quarter earnings that beat analysts' forecasts, citing improved performance in its aviation and oil and gas divisions. GE has a broad range of businesses that cover so many parts of the economy, from banking to building nuclear reactors, that investors see its results as a bellwether for how U.S. industry is doing. GE rose 57 cents to $24.82. Textron, another industrial conglomerate, had the second-biggest gain in the S&P 500 index after its own earnings came in far ahead of what analysts were expecting. Textron rose $2.99, or 9 percent, to $36.65. Trader Gregory Rowe works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange Friday . Overall, the S&P 500's industrial sector rose nearly 2 percent, making it the best performing part of the market. Next week will be one of the busiest periods for Wall Street this earnings season. A total of 130 companies in the S&P 500 index will report quarterly results next week, including big names like American Express, Cola-Cola, AT&T and IBM. Investors also had two pieces of positive economic data to work through. A survey by the University of Michigan showed consumer sentiment unexpectedly rose last month to 86.4, much higher than the 84.3 expected by economists. It was the highest reading for that survey since July 2007, right before the Great Recession. The Commerce Department reported that construction firms broke ground on more apartment complexes in September, up 6.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.017 million homes. Specialists Ronnie Howard (left) and Christopher Culhane confer on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange . Homebuilders rose on the news. Hovnanian Enterprises gained 21 cents, or 6 percent, to $3.71 and Beazer Homes rose 72 cents, or 4 percent, to $17.71. On Friday oil prices rose slightly, but were still down 4 percent for the week on prospects of lower demand from a slowing global economy and high supplies. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 5 cents to close at $82.75 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many U.S. refineries, rose 34 cents to close at $86.16 on the ICE Futures exchange in London. In other energy futures trading on the NYMEX, wholesale gasoline rose 2.2 cents to close at $2.233 a gallon, heating oil rose 2.8 cents to close at $2.498 a gallon and natural gas fell 3 cents to close at $3.766 per 1,000 cubic feet .

"Washington Redskins tight end Niles Paul stopped by his locker before a recent practice to drop off a carry-out plate of baked chicken, black-eyed peas and rice. The mini-feast would become dinner later that evening for a player who doesn't cook, one of the many advantages of playing for a NFL team with a full-time, fine-dining chef. It's quite the change from Paul's previous options. Sous Chef Connor McQuire cooks eggs for NFL Washington Redskins players breakfast at the Players Club cafeteria kitchen at Redskins Park in Ashburn, Va. Over the last 13 months, the Redskins have changed the diets of many of its players by converting the basketball and racquetball courts in the Redskins Park basement into a made-to-order, healthy-options eating establishment . The gas burner in the pizza oven burns at NFL Washington Redskins Players Club cafeteria kitchen at Redskins Park in Ashburn . 'Probably Wendy's, and get a Baconator,' he said. Over the last 13 months, the Redskins have changed the diets of many players by converting the basketball and racquetball courts in the Redskins Park basement into a made-to-order, healthy-options eating establishment. There's a chef with a French cuisine background, a sous-chef, five cooks and a full-time nutritionist creating some 350 fresh-from-scratch meals per day — mostly breakfast and lunch — for the players, coaches, support staff and other employees. 'If I was going to take a leap from the fine-dining branch, why not go polar-opposite and try to do clean-eating for a football team and see where it goes,' said the head chef, 49-year-old Jon Mathieson, a top name in the D.C. dining community who was hired away by Redskins owner Dan Snyder. Teams invest more than a hundred million dollars annually in player salaries, yet they often fuel those high-performance bodies with standard fare catered from a local restaurant during the week. Ofelia Ramirez prepars onions and celery in the NFL Washington Redskins Players Club cafeteria kitchen at Redskins Park . NFL Washington Redskins Wide Receiver DeSean Jackson walking through the teams Players Club cafeteria at Redskins Park . That's what the Redskins did until the start of last season, setting out lunches of Mexican, Italian, barbecue or other fare — whatever the catering company had to offer — much of it containing heavy sauces and empty calories. Of course, the team did win three three Super Bowls while eating McDonald's hamburgers for lunch in 1980s and early 1990s. 'But they were also smoking cigarettes and drinking malt liquor,"" tight end Logan Paulsen said. ""The culture's changed. It's another resource that 20 years ago wasn't really looked into, and now it is. They didn't take care of their bodies the way we do now. There wasn't the necessity for it because no one was doing it."" The kitchen was part of a $30 million building renovation and opened just over a year ago. The Redskins say they are one of a handful of teams that employ a full-time nutritionist, and on-site chefs are even rarer in the league. Kale and peanut butter are ready to use at the smoothie bar at the NFL Washington Redskins Players Club cafeteria . A view of the NFL Washington Redskins individual player's breakfast orders at the teams Players Club cafeteria kitchen . 'If your diet starts to suffer a little bit, then your play is going to suffer,' Redskins coach Jay Gruden said. 'You'll get more tired and you're going to sleep worse at night. It all goes hand-in-hand. It's hard to be a physical specimen and have a terrible diet.' Snyder spared no expense in giving Mathieson and nutritionist Rob Skinner every toy a food connoisseur could imagine: two wok stations, cheese melters, a pasta station, an omelet station, a brick pizza oven with the word 'Redskins' visible next to the flame, a smoothie bar, industrial-sized pots that can cook a week's worth of meat sauce at a time. Mathieson arrives before 5 a.m. every day, a delivery truck shows up within an hour, and soon the kitchen is running like a well-oiled machine preparing 75 pounds of fish, 75 pounds of some other meat protein and as many as 30 pizzas per day. NFL Washington Redskins Executive Chef Jon Mathieson arrives before 5 a.m. every day, a delivery truck shows up within an hour, and soon the kitchen is running like a well-oiled machine preparing 75 pounds of fish, 75 pounds of some other meat protein and as many as 30 pizzas per day . Breakfast might include scrambled egg whites, turkey bacon and sausage, apple chicken sausage and an omelet station that runs the vegetable gamut. For lunch, Mathieson comes up with inventive, healthy ways to cook fish, chicken or turkey and occasionally beef. A recovery smoothie is waiting at every player's locker after practice. 'Berry' and 'tropical' are popular flavors, although Paulsen goes for the more exotic 'kale.' Some players buy in more than others. Running back Alfred Morris provided a comical highlight last season by declining comment on coach Mike Shanahan's firing. Why? Because Morris said he had to get to Chick-fil-A before it stopped serving breakfast. 'Dietitians are salesmen,' Skinner said. 'We're trying to sell good health. We're trying to sell better performance. Do guys still eat fried chicken? Of course, they do. ... I don't whip, but I gently nudge in the right direction. I get all the time, I'll stand here and they'll say, 'Well, which one's better?' And I'll say, 'This one.' They'll say, 'But I don't want that one.' I'll say, 'You didn't ask me what you wanted, you asked me what was better, and this is better.'' Quarterback Kirk Cousins has been known to text Skinner from a grocery store to ask which product is a healthier choice. Veteran Santana Moss brought in a recipe for garlic crab legs from his native Florida, and Mathieson cooked it as a special meal for the receivers. The chef's craftiest masterpiece might be his pizza. Knowing it was a treat dish that players couldn't resist, he changed the dough, adding yogurt and milk and whole wheat flour. NFL Washington Redskins Guard Shawn Lauvao eats breakfast in the team's  Players Club cafeteria . 'We started with 50-50 to see what they would do, and if they kicked back on it,' Mathieson said. 'No one said anything. We went 75-25. No one kicked back on it.' It's 100 per cent now, and a quick poll of the locker room shows that the pizza is probably second to salmon among the players' favorites from the kitchen. Skinner consults with the team's doctor about individual players. He advises them how to eat when they're not at the facility, but he obviously can't control whether they follow his advice. An average player eats about twice the protein of a normal person, although a lineman's diet is obviously more caloric than a kicker's. And then there are the coaches, who live perhaps the unhealthiest lives of all, meeting deep into the night and getting by on little sleep. 'I've talked to them about putting me on a meal plan,' Gruden said. 'But I go down there and I always look for the most fattening food and eat that. I'm terrible.'","Culinary staff includes chef with a French cuisine .

"France's former first lady reportedly came to blows with another woman she saw chatting to Francois Hollande's friends in a Paris bar. Guests at the private party looked on in shock as Valerie Trierweiler 'scratched and pulled the hair' of her 'treacherous' former friend, Valerie de Senneville. The pair were attending the wedding anniversary party of their mutual friend, politician Jean-Luc Romero, when the scuffle erupted in the Banana Cafe on September 28. Fury: Former French First Lady Valerie Trierweiler (left) attacked her former pal Valerie de Senneville in the trendy Banana Cafe in Paris . Miss Trierweiler – nicknamed 'the rottweiler' – had spotted Miss de Senneville talking to friends of President Hollande, who she felt had abandoned her after she was dumped for actress Julie Gayet last year. The former first lady challenged Miss de Senneville and the two attacked each other in front of dozens of people, the magazine France-Dimanche reported. It said Miss Trierweiler 'scratched her with one hand and pulled her hair with the other', before fellow guests managed to break up the fight. Miss de Senneville was later persuaded not to bring legal action for assault against the president's former girlfriend, the magazine said. Happier times: Ms Trierweiler and Francois Hollande are photographed in public in May 2012 before the French president ended their seven-year relationship after his affair with actress Julie Gayet went public . The two women became friends more than 20 years ago, as they both launched careers as political journalists in Paris. Both then went on to be linked to high-flying socialist politicians, with Miss Trierweiler becoming close friends with Mr Hollande ten years ago, and Miss de Senneville meeting party activist Michel Sapin in 2010. When Miss de Senneville married Mr Sapin in 2011, Mr Hollande was best man at their wedding. After becoming president a year later, he appointed Mr Sapin as his finance minister. Bar brawl: The pair of women had to be pulled apart by fellow party-goers at the swanky Banana Cafe in Paris . When Mr Hollande's affair was revealed, Miss de Senneville consoled the former first lady during a holiday in Mauritius. Miss Trierweiler, 49, has angered the French Socialist party in recent weeks after publishing a tell-all memoir, in which she claims the president 'does not like poor people' and refers to them as 'the toothless'. It also tells how she tried to overdose on sleeping pills when she learned of his trysts with film star Miss Gayet, 42. Embittered Miss Trierweiler wrote about her boyfriend of nine years: 'He portrays himself as a man who doesn't like the rich. But in reality, the president does not like poor people. He, a man of the Left, says in private 'les sans-dents' [the toothless] and he is very proud of his humour.' She reportedly received an advance of more than £70,000 for the memoir, which is entitled Thank You For This Moment. French newspaper Le Parisien said Mr Hollande had not been aware of Miss Trierweiler's book and he was 'dismayed' to hear it had been published. Miss Trierweiler learned of the president's affair with Miss Gayet after he was pictured being dropped off at her home on a motorbike. It was claimed she flew into such a rage that she smashed up his office – causing £2.5million worth of damage.

"For a manager with a reputation for caution, it seemed a very odd decision to leave out Ashley Cole and plump for a teenager with one cap. Even as Roy Hodgson tried to explain his reasons he did not seem convinced, and yet nobody will have paid more attention to these two left backs set on radically different trajectories. Luke Shaw, at 18, is rising at a breathtaking rate, a seemingly unstoppable force scouted by every top club in Europe. Cole is fading. Finished: Ashley Cole, who has 107 England caps, has retired from international football . Changing of the guard: Luke Shaw will go to the World Cup ahead of long-time left back Cole . In public, Jose Mourinho has been ultra-supportive of a man who has served him loyally. The Chelsea manager has tried his best to credit Cesar Azpilicueta rather than find fault with Cole, but the Cole of old is not replaced at left back by a right back. No more than the Cole of old is replaced at international level by Leighton Baines. No more than the Cole of old spends half an hour struggling to contain Cardiff’s Mats Daehli. Cole’s form has slipped from its very high standards. It is a trend that started last year and continued into this, amplified by the damaged confidence which comes from losing your aura of invincibility. Mourinho and Hodgson have agreed on this. That does not mean he is a spent force. Cole remains a fine player and an attractive free transfer, but Chelsea’s defenders have all been impressive within Mourinho’s strong unit. If he had played left back at Everton this season, the physical limitations of a  33-year-old with delicate ankles would have been more severely tested. Mourinho wants his full backs to defend, not bomb on, and protects them with midfield enforcers in Ramires and Nemanja Matic. Hodgson will want more from his left back, but tactical deliberations are beside the point. Cole has lost his World Cup place because he was not good enough to keep his Chelsea place. By the time he returned in late April, the England manager’s mind was made up. Give youth a chance: Roy Hodgson announced his England squad for the World Cup on Monday . Where next? Ashley Cole is resigned to leaving Chelsea this summer as his contract ends . During Cole’s absence, Hodgson studied Shaw and became convinced he was ready for international football. His emergence also fits into a broader philosophy which can serve England well. Hodgson wants to do well at the World Cup but expectations are low and he can start to extend his vision, because failing to reach Euro 2016 in France looks almost impossible given England’s group. Here is a rare luxury. Hodgson can start by enveloping the best of the young players into the framework and giving them time to train together and play together. At the same time, Shaw and Baines are exciting players. They are quite capable of rewarding the England manager for discarding his cloak of caution. Finished: Cole retired from international football having been left out of England's World Cup squad . Uncertain future: John Terry earned a new contract, but Cole and Frank Lampard are yet to receive an offer .","Ashley Cole was left out of the 23-man England World Cup squad .

Those living in the neighbhrood were not amused to see the writing suggesting that their quiet community has been touched by the deadly virus, which claimed its first victim on US soil as recently as last week. Scroll down for video . Gallows humor: Residents in Scottsdale, Arizona, woke up Tuesday to find the words 'Ebola quarantine zone' spray-painted on the fence surrounding their gated community . Under the cover of darkness: The vandals behind the disturbing graffiti defaced the wall sometime Monday night . Homeowners Association President John Melling jumped into action and quickly had the upsetting graffiti covered up with a coat of brown paint, AZCentral.com reported. ‘It's not a joke, this is something that's in the forefront of the news right now and for somebody to do that, it goes beyond vandalism,’ Melling said. With the number of patients suffering from the devastating illness on the rise, people in the area say Ebola is not a laughing matter. Police in Scottsdale said they have opened an investigation into the act of vandalism that has left homeowners in the gated community shaken. Lisa Gorgone pointed a finger of blame at bored teenagers who have nothing better to do than to destroy public property, but Jack Carpenter, who has lived in Rio Montana subdivision for more than 20 years, believes there's something more to it. ‘The writing was pretty clear,’ he told ABC15. ‘It suggests an activist as opposed to someone who was just doing it as a prank.’ Cover-up: The homeowners' association acted quickly to paint over the red letters . Crime and punishment: The person or people responsible for the act of vandalism will face misdemenor charges . Trying to make light of the situation, Tracy Garrity quipped that she was surprised the vandals knew how to spell the word 'quarantine' correctly. Police Officer Dave Pubins told AZCentral that the person or people responsible for the callous prank will face misdemeanor charges, if arrested. People in the US and around the world continue to be on edge about the Ebola outbreak, which so far has claimed more than 4,000 lives in western Africa, according to the latest numbers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Thomas Eric Duncan, an American citizen who returned to the US from Ebola-stricken Liberia in mid-September, succumbed to the disease last week while being treated at a hospital in Dallas, Texas. Nurse Nina Pham, 26, also contracted the virus while caring for Duncan at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, and on Wednesday, the CDC confirmed that a second health worker, 29-year-old registered nurse Amber Jay Vinson, tested positive for Ebola.","Vandals left the disturbing graffiti Monday night at the Rio Montana subdivision in Scottsdale .

"A man wanted over an assault and domestic violence incident has mocked authorities who are pursuing him by posting a 'selfie' of himself standing in front of a police station. Aaron Bee, 22, is wanted in connection with an assault and an incident of domestic violence last Wednesday Lincolnshire. The father-of-one first taunted Lincolnshire Police last Friday by saying on Facebook he 'always liked playing hide and seek'. Aaron Bee poses for the 'selfie' outside Lincolnshire Police station, after officers had launched a bid to find and arrest him in connection with an assault and domestic violence incident, saying he 'liked to play hide and seek' Aaron Bee took to social media after Lincolnshire Police had launched a bid to find him, saying he 'always liked playing hide and seek' and he later joked that the authorities' efforts to track him down were 'fun and games' But yesterday the father-of-one taunted police further by posting pictures of himself on the social network site standing outside Lincoln Police Station. Yesterday, Mr Bee said: 'I did it because it's funny. Its (sic) just a bit of fun really. If I've got one message for the police it's 'come catch me if you can'.' Lincolnshire Police launched their appeal to find Mr Bee who is wanted in connection with an assault and an incident of domestic violence last Wednesday. After failing to find him at his home in Lincoln officers turned to the public's help for information. They released a photo of Mr Bee, who then took to social media that evening to mock the force's attempts to trace him. He branded the pursuit as 'fun and games' and joked 'I always liked playing hide and seek as a kid.' Writing on his Facebook page he added: 'How come my photo is all over Facebook ? Anybody would think iam (sic) wanted or something …' Aaron Bee (pictured centre holding a can of beer) on his Facebook account from which he taunted police . He added on Monday: 'Anybody have an idea on a new hiding place ? Theese (sic) rabbit hutch Are getting boring !!!!' A friend, Nicole Laura Stiff, commented on his photos and said she thought Mr Bee 'was joking' when he said he was going to evade the authorities. Another friend, Phil Rowe, said Mr Bee's comments were 'Funny as' and added that Lincolnshire police were the 'worst hide and seek players ever'. Aaron Bee mocks Lincolnshire Police from his Facebook page for their bid to find and arrest the father-of-one . Mr Bee took to his Facebook page again yesterday to say the officers were not serious about tracing his whereabouts. 'It's really funny, I wanted to do it to show how ridiculous this all is and how they obviously aren't that bothered about me. 'They are making me out to be a mass murderer of some sorts but I'm not a violent bloke. But they can't even find me.' Mr Bee added: 'Its only criminal damage and assault and I haven't even been found guilty of them yet. Lincolnshire Police (station in photo) said Mr Bee's online taunts will not thwart their efforts to arrest him . 'I'm not going to hand myself in, they will have to track me down but they haven't tried that hard to find me. 'I was just enjoying the thrill of the chase but it's started to get boring now.' Lincolnshire Police confirmed they were still looking for Mr Bee. A spokesman said: 'We are aware of comments made by Mr Bee on social media. 'He is clearly upset that we wish to speak to him.

"Families should do their Christmas shopping now because a shortage of lorry drivers has raised fears that there could be empty shelves in the shops, the Transport Secretary said last night. Thousands of hauliers have quit over the past few months following a new European Union rule forcing them to sign up to expensive training. In an interview, Patrick McLoughlin said he ‘hopes and thinks’ there will be no problems in the next six weeks, before adding: ‘But I’d advise everybody to get their shopping done.’ Scroll down for video . Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin urged people to get their Christmas shopping done to avoid problems with deliveries . Lorry drivers have warned of an oncoming ‘crisis’, with the threat of Christmas ‘being put on hold’ ahead of the busiest festive period in terms of spending since the banking crisis. Deliveries of presents bought online from firms such as Amazon could also be affected, hauliers warn. And Christmas meals could be affected because perishable vegetables could be delayed. The EU’s new training rules mean the logistics industry is 60,000 drivers short, according to the UK Commission for Employment and Skills. And the Freight Transport Association (FTA) claims 20,000 drivers have either taken early retirement or moved to different jobs since the Certificate of Professional Competence became mandatory in September. The qualification involves 35 hours of training and costs up to £300. Drivers who do not hold it risk a £1,000 fine. James Hookham, managing director of the FTA, said: ‘This is the first Christmas when we have had this requirement and many drivers are saying, “I didn’t take up truck-driving to go back to school” and just voting with their feet.’ Kate Gibbs, of the Road Haulage Association, said: ‘There is a possibility that shelves will empty and be slower to fill this Christmas. ‘We always see people stocking up at Christmas as if the shops are going to be closed for two months. ‘It is the perishable goods – the big bags of mandarin oranges, the vegetables that go with the turkey. All of the perishable goods have a rapid turnover and a short shelf life. We have got to make sure those shelves are filled.’ Labour's shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher hit back at the comments, branding them ‘out of touch’ Julian Thompson, managing director at logistics recruitment company 24-7 Staffing, said: ‘It’s a crisis. Christmas could be put on hold.’ And agencies that provide extra drivers during the pre-Christmas peak say they have no more to spare. Meanwhile, Andrew Starkey, of IMRG, which represents online retailers, said there were signs that less-experienced drivers were being used to meet the shortfall. He said: ‘I’ve had a delivery of wine that has failed to turn up three times. When I queried it I was told, “Terribly sorry we’ve got a temporary driver on”.’ In an interview with the ConservativeHome website, Mr McLoughlin admitted there was a shortage of lorry drivers. But he defended the EU’s new training requirements, saying: ‘If you’re driving a motor vehicle, with the investment you’ve got in that motor vehicle, it’s no bad thing to know what you’re doing.’ New rules mean all lorry drivers must undergo 35 hours of training at a cost of £500, but many have left the industry altogether . Asked whether he would be doing his Christmas shopping early, he said: ‘No. I’d rather not go in to my Christmas present list. I’m actually a bit better prepared this year than I am most years. My wife’s very worried about it. I’ve told her I’ve sorted her present out.’ Last night, sources close to Mr McLoughlin said the Christmas shopping warning was only a ‘light-hearted exchange’. ‘We don’t think there’s any real concern,’ the source said. ‘Driver training makes our roads safer, helping the delivery of presents on time.’ In a Commons debate last month, Tory MP Philip Hollobone warned: ‘The country faces a national shortage of 40,000 qualified HGV drivers, which is acting as a brake on national economic growth.’ Douglas McCormick, from the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, has said: ‘Because logistics underpins the operation of so many other businesses we often do not think about it by itself, but its overall contribution to the economy is huge.’ Britain needs between 45,000 and 60,000 extra lorry drivers, according to estimates. There is a long-running shortage caused by drivers retiring and too few young people choosing haulage as a career. And since September, all drivers must obtain the Driver Certificate of Professional Competence, completing an extra 35 hours training, costing some £500. Under the new rules, drivers who do not hold the new certificate face a fine of £1,000. As many as 20,000 drivers are thought to have quit or retired as a result. The Road Haulage Association wants Chancellor George Osborne to offer funding to train a new generation of drivers - especially women - in next month's Autumn Statement. However, the comments have shone a spotlight on a crisis in the industry, with too few people choosing a career in haulage. Douglas McCormick, from the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, has said: 'Because logistics underpins the operation of so many other businesses we often do not think about it by itself, but its overall contribution to the economy is huge. 'As over 60 per cent of goods in the UK are moved by road, driver shortages would cause serious knock-on effects to the rest of the economy.' A spokesman for online market place eBay said deliveries were crucial to the consumer market. The spokesman said: 'Getting delivery right is absolutely important which is why more than half the items sold by businesses large and small on eBay offer free delivery and a range of fast delivery options. 'More and more, customers are choosing Click and Collect and on eBay there are millions of items available for convenient collection from over 650 Argos stores throughout the UK.'","New training rules for drivers have led to thousands quitting the industry .

"Sam Allardyce's final act as West Ham manager will be to try to wrestle the title away from Manchester City's grasp this weekend. Sportsmail understands the decision has been made privately to sack Allardyce following Sunday's visit to the Etihad Stadium. The 59-year-old has successfully steered the club to top-flight security after a difficult start to the season. It's over: Sam Allardyce will be sacked by West Ham United after their game against Manchester City . Not a happy bunch: West Ham supporters have grown tired of Allardyce's tactics at Upton Park . But a growing contingent of supporters have turned on the former Bolton boss, despite the team's improvement since the start of 2014. Allardyce's tactics have become a major bone of contention among Hammers fans, and the anger towards the manager from supporters has not gone unnoticed by owners David Sullivan and David Gold. And the club's hierarchy will look to appease disgruntled fans by replacing Allardyce after the club's clash against the champions-elect on Sunday. Allardyce has remained bullish about his job prospects in recent weeks, and will hold a scouting meeting on Thursday as he looks to finalise the club's transfer blueprint this summer. However, the manager will not have the chance to implement his summer spending plan. Sections of the Upton Park faithful have been vociferous in their condemnation of Allardyce in recent weeks. A survey of 12,392 Hammers fans taken . last month saw 77.95 percent vote in favour of Allardyce leaving the . east London club this summer. Little bit of flair: Allardyce has guided the Hammers to Premier League survival for a second year . He was booed by home fans after the final whistle of March's clash against Hull - despite winning the match 2-1. His last task as Hammers boss will be to secure a shock win at the Etihad Stadium, which could open the door for Liverpool to snatch the Barclays Premier League title away from Manuel Pellegrini's side on the final day of the season. Realistically, City must only avoid defeat against the Hammers to secure their second league title in three seasons. However, defeat will hand Liverpool the title as long as Brendan Rodgers' side beat Newcastle.","West Ham are ready to sack manager Sam Allardyce .

The company says more than 55 million gamers visit its site every month. 'Nerds are sexy, and you're all magnificent, beautiful creatures, but let's try and keep this about the games, shall we?' reads a section titled 'Dress ... appropriately' in Twitch's new Rules of Conduct. Under the new rules, gamers can be suspended from Twitch for nudity or broadcasting themselves wearing items 'including lingerie, swimsuits, pasties, and undergarments.'

It comes amid an online furore known as Gamergate. Beginning this summer, people involved in an online campaign dubbed ""Gamergate"" have been harassing several prominent women in the video game industry and their supporters for criticizing the lack of diversity and how women are portrayed in games.

Earlier this month, people threatened her and her husband with rape, death and castration on Twitter and posted her address online, she said, and they have been trying to impersonate her on the Internet to smear her reputation. She got so frightened that she left her home in Boston. Wu went to the police, but most people harassed online don't. According to Pew, just 5 percent of those who were harassed reported the incident to law enforcement, while nearly half confronted the person online. Forty-four percent said they unfriended or blocked the person. Most recently, actress Felicia Day, known for the gaming-oriented Web series 'The Guild,' had her email and real-world address posted online less than an hour after a blog post in which she criticized GamerGate.

"A U.S. Marine who vanished from his unit in Iraq and later wound up in Lebanon for eight years will face trial on desertion and other charges, the military said Friday. Maj. Gen. William D. Beydler has referred 34-year-old Cpl. Wassef Hassoun for a general court-martial on charges of desertion, larceny and destruction of government property, according to a news release from the Marines. No date has been set for Hassoun's trial at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, where he is being held. Marine Corps Corporal Wassef Ali Hassoun was charged a month ago with desertion in a mysterious case in which he left his unit in Iraq only to turn up in Lebanon . The case began in June 2004, when Hassoun disappeared from a base in Fallujah, Iraq. About a week later, he appeared in a photo purportedly taken by insurgents. Hassoun was blindfolded and had a sword poised above his head. Hassoun, a naturalized American citizen who was born and grew up in Lebanon, turned up days later at the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon saying he was kidnapped by extremists. But the military doubted his story, and he was brought back to the U.S. while charges were considered. He was allowed to visit relatives in Utah in December 2004 when he disappeared again — eventually winding up back in Lebanon. The case began in June 2004, when Hassoun disappeared from a base in Fallujah, Iraq . Defense attorney Haytham Faraj argues that Hassoun was prevented from leaving for years by Lebanese authorities and came back to the U.S. after travel restrictions were lifted. Faraj, himself a former Marine, said he's seen many similar cases dating to the Vietnam era in which the desertion charge was changed to unauthorized absence, and service members were given administrative punishment. To prove desertion, the military must show a serviceman intended not to come back. 'The intent to remain permanently away isn't there,' Faraj said. 'Here we have a clear case of a person who came back.' Faraj has said the report by the military equivalent of a grand jury hearing notes that the case consists mostly of circumstantial evidence and that many witnesses, including some in Iraq, would be hard to find. Hassoun approaches a podium to read a statement to the media July 19, 2004 outside the U.S. Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia. saying he was captured and held against his will by anti-coalition forces for 19 days . Military prosecutors argue Hassoun was unhappy with his deployment and left the Marines in Iraq in 2004. They cited witnesses who said Hassoun didn't like how the U.S. was interrogating Iraqis and that he said he wouldn't shoot back at Iraqis. Military officials say a marriage for Hassoun had been arranged with a woman in Lebanon. They are now married and have a son who has dual U.S. and Lebanese citizenship. Faraj, who maintains the kidnapping story is true, has said his client traveled to Lebanon in early 2005 while on leave and was soon arrested. Faraj argues that court proceedings in Lebanon were triggered by the U.S. charges against Hassoun. Military prosecutors argue Hassoun, seen here with brother Mohamad Hassoun, was unhappy with his deployment and left the Marines in Iraq in 2004 . Marine prosecutors say Hassoun's whereabouts were unknown for eight years. He was returned to the U.S. in 2014 after he contacted officials here. Translated Lebanese government documents provided to the court say Hassoun was arrested in 2005 by Lebanese authorities after Interpol issued a bulletin triggered by his status as a deserter. The documents, which the defense also gave to The Associated Press, say Lebanese authorities released him but took his passport and prevented him from traveling. The documents indicate that Lebanese officials declined to extradite Hassoun and he was eventually fined for theft of military tools — a charge that mirrors the U.S. larceny count.","Cpl.

"A computer hacker who famously stole nude photos from Paris Hilton’s cell phone and posted her contacts online has apologized some nine years after publicly embarrassing the socialite. Cameron Lacroix, now 26, was just a teenager when he cracked Hilton’s T-Mobile account in 2005 in the first example of a celebrity’s phone being hacked. Lacroix, who has spent the past 10 years carrying out a range of cyber-crimes, is attempting to put his house in order before he begins a four-year sentence in federal prison. Scroll down for video . Cameron Lacroix, now 26, was just a teenager when he cracked Hilton’s T-Mobile account in 2005 in the first example of a celebrity’s phone being hacked . ‘Paris, I’m sorry I put your information online,’ he told NBC News. ‘I should never have done it. I wouldn’t want it done to me.’ Along with embarrassing Hilton, Lacroix, from New Bedford, Massachusetts, also famously hacked Burger King’s Twitter account last year. Along with these high profiles crimes, Lacroix has also hacked federal law enforcement databases, changed his community college grades and caused more than $1 million in damage to private firms. Lacroix was just 16 in 2005 when he cracked the code to Hilton’s Sidekick phone. Lacroix hacked into T-Mobile’s computer system and decided to check if there was a phone registered in Hilton’s name since she was advertising the Sidekick . He had decided to hack into T-Mobile’s computer system because he wanted a free phone, but on realizing how easy it was he decided to check if there was a phone registered in Hilton’s name since she was advertising the product. ‘Sure enough, it was under her name. I went into it and was shocked at what I saw,’ he said. Publishing Hilton’s phonebook and nude photos online made Lacroix feel good about himself. ‘I wanted to be a celebrity,' said the computer obsessive whose mom had died of a drug overdose when he was young and who had dropped out of high school, ‘it was mind-blowing for me. … I felt famous.’ But Lacroix also got noticed by federal officials and was soon serving 11 months in a federal juvenile facility for the Hilton hacking and other offences. Over the next seven years he served several stretches inside and says that when he wasn’t in prison he was committing further cyber-crimes including steeling credit card numbers from online retailers. Lacroix's other high profile hack happened in February 2013, when he gained access to Burger King’s Twitter account and changed the logo to McDonald's golden arches . Lacroix's other high profile hack happened in February 2013, when he gained access to Burger King’s Twitter account. He replaced the fast-food chain’s logo with McDonald’s golden arches and said that Burger King had been sold to its competitor because 'the Whopper flopped.' In October he was sentenced to four years in federal prison and has vowed to go straight when he gets out of jail in 2018, by which time he will be 30. After his release, Lacroix plans to put his hacking skills to good use for the federal authorities and credit card companies that he has spent the past 10 years scamming. 'I’ve caused a lot of harm. I’ve got to fix this,' he said.","Cameron Lacroix was just a teenager when he cracked Hilton's T-Mobile account in 2005 in the first example of a celebrity's phone being hacked .

"Infatuation: Sophia Loren and Cary Grant in The Pride And The Passion, the film they were making when Grant made his first attempt to woo the Italian star . Sophia Loren's memoirs will reveal in excruciating detail how Hollywood idol Cary Grant twice tried to convince her to become his lover. For the 300-page Yesterday, Today And Tomorrow - My Life, the Italian screen legend, who turned 80 last month, has fished out old pictures, letters and notes detailing their encounters. It includes details of how Grant suggested they should pray to make the right decision as he tried his utmost to seduce her while they worked together on a film set. The pair became infatuated in 1956 when she was only 22 and already romantically linked to her future husband, the film producer Carlo Ponti. Grant was 52 and on his third marriage, but he nevertheless asked the young star to marry him while they were filming The Pride And The Passion, a Napoleonic-era adventure romance based on a novel by CS Forester. 'Forgive me, dear girl,' reads one letter reproduced as a photograph in Loren's book. 'I press you too much. Pray - and so will I - until next week. Goodbye Sophia. Cary.' Prayer was a word that appeared repeatedly in notes from Grant, who died in 1986. Another reads: 'You'll be in my prayers. If you think and pray with me, for the same thing and purpose, all will be right and life will be good'. Loren was born Sofia Scicolone in Rome on September 20, 1934, the daughter of a frustrated actress whose lover had refused to marry her. She grew up in Pozzuoli, a poor town near Naples, and remembered begging for food from U.S. soldiers during World War Two. She was so thin her nickname was stuzzicadenti (toothpick). Her mother took her to Rome, where she earned a small income for both of them by modelling for pulp magazines and winning prizes in beauty contests. At one contest in the early 1950s she was spotted by Carlo Ponti, who secured her first roles. Although he was 22 years older than her, three years later he had left his wife and they were married - a union that lasted for five decades until Ponti's death in 2007. Goat: Grant was 52 and on his third marriage, but he nevertheless asked the young Loren, just 22, to marry him . 'Pray with me': Loren looks rapt with attention as she spends time with Grant between takes on the film's set . 'I had to make a choice': Loren with her husband Carlo Ponti, who she chose over Grant . Loren said of her decision to stay with Ponti despite the attentions of Grant, then a Hollywood heavyweight: ‘You know, I had to make a choice, Carlo was Italian; he belonged to my world. ‘I know it was the right thing to do, for me. ‘At the time I didn’t have any regrets, I was in love with my husband. I was very affectionate with Cary, but I was 23 years old. ‘I couldn’t make up my mind to marry a giant from another country and leave Carlo. I didn’t feel like making the big step.’ In the interview with Vanity Fair Loren admitted she craved ‘a legitimate husband, children, a family like anybody else’. Loren with Grant Washington, DC, in 1957: The rejctions didn't stop Grant taking another punt at the Italian . But the initial rejection didn't stop Grant making another punt at the Italian bombshell two years later, on the set of the romantic comedy Houseboat, set in Washington and based on an idea by Grant's wife Betsy Drake. Drake had been expected to star in the film herself but her marriage with Grant was on the rocks, leading producers to replace her with Loren. Director Melville Shavelson later complained that the simmering sexual tension between Grant and Loren made the movie difficult to make. The story seems to contradict persistent rumours since Grant's death that he was in fact gay. Passion: Loren and Grant in a scene from the romantic comedy Houseboat, who director complained over their simmering sexual tension . Loren's book reads like a who's who of world cinema in the past 60 years as it chronicles the life of an illegitimate southern Italian street urchin who became one of the world's most glamorous film stars. Its title comes from the 1963 three-part comedy anthology directed by cinema great Vittorio De Sica in which she played three different roles. The 'tomorrow' part appears to be her way of saying her career is not over. Her last film - an adaption of Jean Cocteau's The Human Voice - was released this year. Each time Loren marks a major milestone it is almost a national event in Italy, in part a bittersweet reminder that the boom times she epitomised at the height of her fame are gone. One television channel has been running only Loren films all week as a tribute to the woman who won two Oscars, first in 1961 for her tragic portrayal of a war-time mother in De Sica's neo-realistic classic 'La Ciociara' (Two Women). Photo exhibitions and roundtables are being held about the extraordinary rise to planetary stardom of a poor teenager discovered by a film producer who later married her and made her what one critic called Italy's greatest export after pasta. But, as the book shows, behind the mesmerising olive green eyes and silken cappuccino skin of her youth was a will of steel and an exceptional talent. Such has been her unfading allure that one Roman Catholic cardinal quipped several years ago that while cloning was ethically wrong, an exception might be made for Loren. In the book she describes her relations with several leading men aside from Grant, and reveals how she cut off an advance by Brando when they were filming 1967's 'A Countess from Hong Kong'. 'All of a sudden he put his hands on me. I turned in all tranquillity and blew his face, like a cat stroked the wrong way and said, 'Don't you ever dare to do that again. Never again!',' she writes. 'As I pulverised him with my eyes he seemed small, defenceless, almost a victim of his own notoriety. He never did it again but it was very difficult working with him after that.' She also describes the 17 days she spent in jail in Italy in 1982 as part of a plea bargain over a failure to file an income tax return. At the time she blamed her accountant. The book is published by Rizzoli in Italy and is due to be published in English in the United States in December by Atria Books, a division of Simon and Schuster.","Letters reveal Grant's passionate pursuit of the Italian bombshell .

Nate also took to Facebook to update his friends saying he was 'grateful to be alive' after his condition was upgraded from serious to satisfactory. Spokeswoman Susan Gregg says he's awake and breathing on his own and still in the intensive care unit. Nate and Jaylen grew up together in the Native American Tulalip tribe along with Andrew Fryberg, 15, another brother-like cousin who is in a critical condition in Harborview Medical Center following the attack. Overnight it was revealed that Gia Soriano had died as a result of her injuries. She was the second person to be confirmed dead as a result of the shooting after Zoe Galasso last week. Their classmate and friend Shaylee Chuckulnaskit, remains in critical condition in intensive care at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett. Nate (pictured with gunman Jaylen Fryberg left) was his cousin and best friend. They called each other brother . Speaking out: The youngster also took to Facebook to update his friends on his condition. He was upgraded from serious to satisfactory overnight but is still in the intensive care unit at Harborview Medical Center . While he was still in a serious condition, Nate's mother posted on Facebook . Nate's grandfather, Donald Hatch, revealed Nate started communicating with his family by writing notes as he is unable to speak. Mr Hatch told King5 reporter Alex Rozier that Nate knows it was his close cousin Jaylen who opened fire on the group of friends. He said one of the notes Nate had written to his family reads: 'Grandpa, I still have a bullet in my chest'. Mr Hatch added: I think Nate's either getting his memory back or somebody mentioned what had happened. 'And it kind of broke his heart to hear, ""why would my brother do that to me,"" even though they're cousins. 'Why would my brother do that to me?"" Last week Nate's mother, Denise Hatch-Anderson wrote on Facebook, thanking the community for their support in the aftermath of the shooting. She wrote: 'Thank you so much from the mother of Nate Hatch... i cant [sic] thank everyone from our community for the outpouring love that has been shown [sic] to me since this tragic happened... i love everyone!!! No time for hate just love.' Since the shooting, it has emerged that Jaylen was left heartbroken over a girl who rebuffed him for the his cousin Andrew. In an ominous indication of the anger that spurred his deadly tirade, Jaylen tweeted last month: 'Dude. She tells me everything. And now I f***ing HATE you! Your no longer my 'Brother'!' Friends say it was a reference to the fact that he was crushing on the girl dating Andrew, 15, who is still fighting for life. Couple: Fryberg's other cousin, Andrew, 15, (left) went to the school's homecoming dance days before the shooting with Zoe Galasso, 14, who was killed in the attack.

"A Silicon Valley startup is poised to replace the everyday security guard with high tech robots the company plans to introduce to the world on Thursday. The 300 pound R5 Autonomous Data Machine looks like a hybrid of R2-D2 and the robot from Lost in Space. More than just yelling ‘danger,’ manufacturer Knightscope hopes the machines will actually help predict crimes and even cut current rates in half. And its inventors say it was a recent school shooting that actually inspired them to create the R5. Scroll down for video... Borne out of tragedy: The 5-foot-tall, 300-pound robot was dreamed up by its creators at Sunnyvale, California company Knightscope in the wake of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary. A publicity photo shows how the R5 might look in a school setting . 'You are never going to have an armed officer in every school': Instead of being armed with guns, the R5 will use cameras and other surveillance mechanisms to alert off-site analysts to the possibility of an impending crime (publicity photo) ‘We founded Knightscope after what happened at Sandy Hook,’ Knightscope co-founder William Santana Li told the New York Times. According to Li, the idea was to put the R5, not just where guards already exist, but where they haven’t yet or may never go. ‘You are never going to have an armed officer in every school,’ he explained. Knightscope sees the mobile robot as a security tool that will also one day be placed in businesses and even act as a neighborhood watch in residential areas. The company appears to understand that successfully gaining a foothold in the market could mean the elimination of many of the 1.3 million private security jobs in the United States. They note the savings companies could gain from firing the already low-paid, largely non-union workers in favor of even cheaper—at least in the long run—robotic guards. With minimum wages hovering around $8 per hour, the creators of R5 hope the costs of the robot will be closer to $6.25 per hour according to the New York Times. But they say the role of the guards who keep their jobs will become more like an analyst. ‘We want to give the humans the ability to do the strategic work,’ Li told the Times. The Knightscope K5 Autonomous Data Machine uses something known as a ‘predictive analytics engine’ to assess the level of threat. Essentially this means it finds patterns in historical and current data that might help it see something out of the ordinary. The robot feeds real-time on-site data into this engine using a combination of sensors. These might include a video camera, thermal imaging sensors, a laser range finder, radar, air quality sensors and a microphone. For instance, a thermal imaging sensor may be able to find if a gunman is lurking in an area that is usually barren. It combines this data with existing information on the area from local businesses, government and social media sites. It is then assigned an alert level that determines when the community and the authorities should be notified of a danger. The R5 autonomous data machine is not armed and is unable to disable a threat on its own. Instead, if an alert is signalled, the machine will turn on all of its sensors to allow the police to review the situation in real-time. Cheap? The 300-pound machine would run on the base of a Segway and its creators home it will cost less than minimum wage to operate . Bells and whistles: The R5 features a video camera, thermal imaging sensors, a laser range finder, radar, air quality sensors and a microphone...but no gun . 'Like R2-D2’s evil twin': The hulking device looks like a hybrid of R2-D2 and the robot from Lost in Space. Much like the 1960s sci-fi automaton, the R5 exists to alert its human masters to danger . The strategy, it appears, being to prevent crimes that could be about to happen and the folks at Knightscope are poised to introduce their baby to the world at a press event this coming Thursday. The R5 will come equipped with video camera, thermal imaging sensors, a laser range finder, radar, air quality sensors and a microphone. The tools will signal to authorities when a presence of actual humans with weapons might be needed. This use may conjure negative connotations, in some, of the Tom Cruise film Minority Report where so-called ‘pre-cogs’ predict crimes. And the R5’s creators aren’t deaf to these cinematic parallels. ‘We have a different perspective,’ Mr. Li said. ‘We don’t want to think about RoboCop or Terminator, we prefer . to think of a mash up Batman, Minority Report and R2-D2.’ Futuristic nightmare? ¿We don¿t want to think about RoboCop or Terminator, we prefer to think of a mash up Batman, Minority Report and R2-D2,' says Li . ¿Once you enter public space and collect images and sound recordings, you have entered another realm. This is the kind of pervasive surveillance that has put people on edge,' says electronic privacy analyst Marc Rotenberg . The robots, at least for now, remain unarmed. Critics question the ethics of such a machine, whether or not it carries a gun. ‘This is like R2-D2’s evil twin,’ Marc Rotenberg, director of Washington’s Electronic Privacy and Information Center told the Times. Rotenberg’s issue with such a device seems to be its ability to constantly gather and transmit footage, like a real-time CCTV camera that roams free. ‘There is a big difference between having a device like this one on your private property and in a public space,’ he said. ‘Once you enter public space and collect images and sound recordings, you have entered another realm. This is the kind of pervasive surveillance that has put people on edge.’","The 5-foot, 300-pound R5 Autonomous Data Machine was dreamed up by its creators in the wake of the tragedy at Connecticut's Sandy Hook Elementary .

"The heartbroken mother of a 19-year-old straight-A student who took her own life weeks after filming an amateur porn has revealed their final conversation and spoken out about the vicious bullying her daughter suffered. Melissa Funke, 36, of Stillwater, Minnesota, spoke to her daughter on April 17 only minutes before she committed suicide. The chemistry student then texted her mother 'I just want to die' in a message tragically she didn't see before it was too late, she told MailOnline. Alyssa Funke decided to take part in a sex video with a stranger in Las Vegas for website CastingCouch-X, using the name 'Stella Ann,' as a way of covering college expenses, her mother said - but she couldn't deal with the relentless bullying from former high school classmates that it resulted in. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Bullied: College student Alyssa Funke was mercilessly bullied for appearing in a pornographic video. The 19-year-old Minnesota native, who committed suicide last month, . 'She said she was going to take a shower... and that she was upset from all the bullying,' Melissa Funke recalled. '[But] she is very… she wanted to come off as everything is fine when it is not.' The teen acted as if life would go on, and put on a strong face for her mother before saying she loved her and hanging up the phone. It was a familiar feeling for the 19-year-old who had been bullied since starting school for not being from a wealthy family like many of her classmates in the well-heeled town about 26 miles east of Minneapolis. Only this time she texted 'I just want to die' to her mother after the conversation ended. Tragically Melissa Funke says she was shopping at the time and did not see the message until 20 minutes later. A brave face: Alyssa Funke always tried to stay strong and act as if everything was normal, her mother says, but that clearly was not the case . Straight-A chemistry student Alyssa Funke, 19, from Miinnesota, took her own life two weeks after she dabbled in amateur porn and was mercilessly taunted for it . She contacted Wisconsin authorities to help find the girl. She was found dead by police at 1.59 p.m. in a car borrowed from a friend. The bullying had finally beaten her, Alyssa Funke couldn't put on a brave face anymore. 'She had been bullied since she was a small child,' said her mother. '[Because] she didn't have the nice things... toys, a nice car' that her classmates did. 'It was so many people and she had grown so tired of the bullying…the decision she had made was causing unbareable grief.' Within days of the sex tape's posting online in March, abusive messages flooded her social media accounts. Many from her former schoolmates at Stillwater High, forcing her to delete her Facebook page, her still grieving mother said. High school students reportedly gathered . around tables in the cafeteria to watch Alyssa Funke's sex tape on . their cellphones, according to KMSP-TV. Funke went to Las Vegas for her interview with CastingCouch-X in March where she called herself Stella Ann. She appeared nervous on the tape and talked about her real dreams of becoming an anesthesiologist . During her interview for the amateur porn site in March, Alyssa Funke, who called herself 'Ann' looked nervous and described her college plans and described her childhood as 'pretty much normal' One called Miss Funke a 'thot', a slang word for prostitute, adding: 'Does her dad know?' Another message sniped: 'Nothing brings a school together like a porn star who graduated last year.' But the school denied there was a bullying problem, the mother claims. Miss Funke fought back - defending herself. She tweeted: 'Pornstar status' and 'FAMOUS for dayzzzzz.' The last message she posted on Facebook on March 4 read: 'The people that envy & hate you the most, stalk you on social media the most so, hey hi hello how r u doing, this ones for you.' She wrote a post to her 'future husband' and a vulnerable message about wanting a relationship where you 'never feel unwanted or alone,' but that warmth never came for the distraught teen. Melissa Funke recalled being 'surprised, [but] wasn't really shocked' when Alyssa told her she had filmed the movie. 'There was tons of videos on there, I didn’t know everybody would see mine,' Melissa Funke remembered her daughter saying. But the bullying never stopped - even after her death. Online trolls have been hounding memorial pages in her honor. Many of the messages said 'suicide is a sin' and that the girl 'would burn in hell.' Her devastated family launched The Alyssa Stop Bullying Fund, which has so far raised a meager $165. On the site, a family message reads: 'On Wednesday April 16, at the young age of 19 Alyssa Funke took her . own life. Alyssa like so many other teens was a victim of bully and . sadly the bullying lead to her death.' The teenage college student had a troubled upbringing with her father in jail in Arizona and her mother and a boyfriend arrested for dealing drugs . The local sheriff's office is investigating the teenager's death but does not believe that the messages sent to Miss Funke amount to criminal harassment. The lack of action has left her mother frustrated. 'Because no one told her to kill herself? There should be huge amounts of people on harassment charges and there aren’t [because] town is so image conscious…these kids are not going to have any consequences because they are so concerned about their image,' she continued. Her other 16-year-old daughter is also being bullied, she claims, and very little is being done to help the teen. 'The world is a cruel place and getting worse all the time.' 'If we lived in a different area, it would have been a lot different.' Miss Funke's story draws similarities with Duke student Miriam Weeks, 18, who was outed as porn star Belle Knox earlier this year and also sat on the same Vegas couch for CastingCouch-X. Miss Knox, a women's studies major, made headlines earlier this year when one of her classmates outed her secret life as a porn star to the student body. Since then, she has defended her decision to enter the adult film world on Piers Morgan Live, The View and other talk shows. Only, Alyssa Funke's story has a much sadder outcome, and her mother is left to second-guess. 'I wish I would have known how bad she was feeling at that time, I would have had her with me instead of at college.'

"So what about financial fair play? It wasn’t mentioned as part of the great leap forward and the Football League does have very strict views on this. There are percentages of turnover that can be paid as salary - 55 per cent in League Two, 60 per cent in League One - and huge  punishments for clubs that fail to comply. And into this forest of red tape and limitation, Football Association chairman Greg Dyke wishes to introduce clubs that cannot be bound by those rules for, if they were, they would undoubtedly fail. The Premier League B teams would include players earning far in excess of the norm for the competition and have financial structures that bear no relation to those of the standard lower league club. Vision for the future: FA Chairman Greg Dyke speaks after revealing the commission's findings . To B, or not to B? An animated Dyke outlines his vision for the future of English football . For the . bottom line is that Manchester United B do not really exist. Not as a . real club with a board and an independent revenue stream, and sponsors . and advertisers, supporters and a gate and salaries that conform to the . limitations of League Two. So . to expect Accrington Stanley to be tied to Football League regulations . on expenditure, while playing against a striker earning £25,000 a week . whose owners are not party to the same rules, is entirely unfair. In . 2013, the average wage in League Two was £49,600, annually. An emerging . Premier League player at a major club could expect to earn that in . between two weeks and a month at the worst. So how will the Football . League calculate what is financially fair for the interlopers, . particularly as B teams are  notoriously under-supported? Top table: Commission members Howard Wilkinson, Danny Mills, Dyke with FA press officer Greg Demetriou . Booked: Dyke poses with his 82-page report on the Wembley pitch . Some optimistic souls think the bright young things of Tottenham B would give a revenue boost to the lower divisions but the opposite is true. These teams have no away support, for instance, so that vital revenue stream for Football League clubs might be reduced to a dribble. In Spain, where the B team idea is long established, Real Madrid Castilla — about to be relegated, by the way — are the 19th worst supported team in the second division, with Barcelona B 16th. Real Madrid are averaging crowds of 72,943 in this campaign; Real Madrid Castilla are averaging 3,049. Last season, a single Real Madrid home game amounted to close to 15,000 more than watched Castilla all year. It is the same with Barcelona B. In 2012-13, their average attendance was 5,117 — but one game against Villarreal, who clinched promotion that day, was besieged by 10,000 away fans and drew 13,826, amounting to close to 13 per cent of the season total. Barcelona B had the lowest gate of the season, 977 against Las Palmas; Castilla hold that record this year, 1,136 against Girona. One imagines, once any novelty wears off, England’s B teams may even draw less. You can’t pay players £20,000 a week on gates of, let’s be generous, 2,500. If Morecambe wanted to do it they would be hit with punitive fines. So there is no way of levelling this playing field, unless the Football League insists these B teams are set up as separate entities with their own, quantifiable, financial structure that can be measured against their rivals. And that can’t happen because the salaries are those of aspiring Premier League footballers. On the slide: Real Madrid Castilla are on the verge of being relegated . Low crowds: The Real Madrid B Team are the 19th worst supported side in the second division . That’s the technical, practical point. Here’s one from the heart. Liverpool fans sing that Chelsea have no history, and that’s rubbish — but Chelsea B certainly haven’t. And neither have Liverpool B, Stoke City B, Manchester City B or any other Bs you care to name. Meanwhile, in the lower leagues, away from the daily narrative spilled across our back pages and television screens, there are rivalries that go back decades, maybe even centuries, fixtures that are anticipated all year, while barely registering in the wider world. Pride of Lancashire: Blackpool and Preston have a rivalry that no B team can match . Fierce rivalry: If Premier League B teams are integrated into the lower leagues it could devalue the rivalries of teams like Mansfield and Chesterfield . Grimsby Town and Lincoln City, the only teams in Lincolnshire; Colchester United and Southend United, the two from Essex; the Sheffield derby; the Bristol derby; Blackpool versus Preston North End; Luton Town versus Watford; any meeting involving Plymouth Argyle, Torquay United and Exeter City. One of the bitterest derbies in English football is Chesterfield versus Mansfield Town. Their grounds are 10 miles apart and there has always been rivalry, but in 1984 the Derbyshire miners went on strike while the Nottinghamshire miners remained at work. It hasn’t been pretty since. So introducing a raft of B teams into these leagues dilutes those passions and that intensity. Not discounting that every team in those lower leagues bears the name of its community. Who carries the banner for Fleetwood besides the local football club, particularly once it is kicked further down the league by this invasion of Premier League wannabes? There is an identity in following Hartlepool or Bury that Arsenal B will never possess. They deserve their voice, their place and their status. New league: Young stars like Chelsea's Ruben Loftus-Cheek could play in the FA's new proposed league . Back to the technical. What happens when the top of League One becomes a giant bottleneck through which B teams cannot pass? Dyke says League One will be the limit of aspiration for B clubs, but they will be able to occupy promotion places, even if they cannot take the promotion. What happens if the top eight teams in League One cannot go up, and promotion and play-offs involve those ranked ninth to 14th? Those clubs will not be equipped for the Championship. They will not have sufficient form or financial strength based on revenue to cope. Crowds are drawn to winning football and the ninth placed team in League One this season, Port Vale, lost 21 matches. Could we seriously consider promotion for a team who had been beaten that many times? Promotion is about momentum. What keeps a team afloat in a higher division is often the positive energy that has been built over the previous winning campaign. Yet what momentum will a mid-table club  rising by default have; how will they cope without that thrust? Reserve teams used to play in the Football Combination and the Central League but as the modern game evolved, so major Premier League clubs became dissatisfied with that model. They didn’t like the idea of their precious young talent being kicked around an empty stadium by much older professionals, inferior, on the wane and cynical, or desperate to impress the manager that they were ready for first-team action on Saturday. This, if anything, is worse. Playing against some hatchet-faced old pro from the lower leagues, whose  methods might be at best agricultural, is hardly the best preparation for a career among the elite. Loan issues: The current loan system allows bigger clubs to stockpile players and loan them out - as Chelsea do with Thibaut Courtois . Unless it addresses the loan system Dyke’s plan is bunk anyway. Thibaut Courtois is likely to return to  Chelsea this summer and replace Petr Cech in the first team. Would he have been able to do that had he spent three years playing the likes of Wycombe Wanderers? No. So why would Chelsea use their B team when they could still loan a player to Liverpool, Everton, Atletico Madrid or Vitesse Arnhem, as happened this season? Tomas Kalas came straight into the first team and performed excellently against Liverpool because he had honed his talent against clubs like Ajax and PSV Eindhoven in the Dutch league. It isn’t the same against Northampton Town. Starlet: Dyke has the support of Manchester United, with young talent like James Wilson . Without the loan system, the elite could no longer stockpile and their best young players would make careers at smaller clubs, many in the Premier League, as used to happen. Now if the B teams become reality, the powerful can keep close to 30 or 40 players on elastic in the top divisions and below, and nothing in Dyke’s paper truly addresses that. Outlawing loans, however, would have meant taking on the rich and powerful and the FA are not so bold. So what might be a way forward? No loan system and a clearly defined Under 23 league for top level club academy players, outside the pyramid, with a trophy, a financial incentive, and a proper television contract. A star is born: Johnny Haynes became an overnight sensation when he played for England Schoolboys against Scotland in front of 55,000 at Wembley . What if two slots each weekend were set aside for live Under 23 league matches - 10.45 to 12.30 on Saturday and 12 until 2 on Sunday - serving as a taster for the Premier League action later? People would watch their team; they might tune in to see a top-of-the-table clash, too, or an individual with a growing reputation. In the early days of television, before saturation coverage made every game available, Johnny  Haynes became a name overnight for his performance in a match between England and Scotland schoolboys. There is an appetite for a proper youth competition and the success of the NextGen Series proved it. UEFA weren’t getting a slice of that pie, however, so they started their own tournament based entirely around the Champions League clubs and killed it. Yes, there are good ideas in Dyke’s blueprint - a tougher stance on work permit regulation is long  overdue, even if Willian was among the 30 per cent of players who required special dispensation this season. Some will at least credit Dyke with starting a debate. Yet the B team league is his big idea and it is hopelessly, catastrophically, flawed. If a debate begins with a fanfare and ends five minutes later with a raspberry, it really isn’t much of a conversation at all.","FA chairman Greg Dyke and the commission's plan for Premier League B teams is doomed to fail .

"Former New York Rangers forward Sean Avery threw in his acting debut two days before the off-broadway show was set to open after having a 'complete meltdown' during rehearsals, according to reports. Christy Smith-Sloman - author of the play, Negative is Positive - told Page Six that Avery - who was ousted from Dancing With The Stars earlier this year - stormed off set after being offered pizza by an assistant. 'It’s a complete horror story,' she told the column. 'Avery had a complete meltdown in rehearsals and quit. 'He pretty much snapped.' 'Breakdown': Sean Avery, 34, reportedly stormed off set of Negative is Positive on Tuesday. The show's playwright says he is no longer welcome in the production . Debut: The play - set to open at Theater for the New City on Thursday - is seen here in rehearsals . 'Complete horror story': Avery was accused of being a 'madman' ahead of the show opening this week . Retired: Sean Avery stopped playing professional ice hockey in 2012 . The show will open at Theater for the New City in the East Village on Thursday night. The incident with Avery is said to have started on Monday, when he left rehearsals after becoming agitated, according to Page Six. The issue escaled on Tuesday when the assistant stage manager asked Avery if he wanted some pizza. A miscommunication occurred and Avery believed the woman had referred to him as an 'a--hole'. Avery allegedly lost it at the woman, who was reduced to tears. The director, Andreas Robertz, told the column Avery then left. 'I think something snapped in him,' Robertz said. Smith-Sloman added that Avery is not welcome back. 'At this point I don’t want him to be a part of this production,' she said. 'He can’t call people pieces of s--- and say, ''Do you know who I am?''.(He) can’t threaten people.' Avery has not commented on the incident at the theater. Engaged: In November last year, Avery became engaged to Sports Illustrated model Hilary Rhoda. The couple are seen here in New York on July 24 . He will be replaced by an understudy. Negative is Positive is a comedy-drama about a newly-married interracial couple. Avery was to play the pair's close friend. Avery retired from ice hockey in 2012 and began working at New York advertising agency Lipman. Appearing on Dancing With The Stars earlier this year, Avery said at the time that his early exit from the show was the result of an argument with a producer. 'I had a conversation with Conrad (Green), one of the producers, and I was upset at the package that they had brought in the week previous, and it was a very tacky attempt to show me as the bad boy of DWTS,' Avery said on Good Morning America after leaving the show. 'And I think in reality TV or some sort of competition, if you have a disagreement with the producers, then generally that seals your fate quite early.' Messing around: Prolific on social media, Avery is seen here in a photo from his Instagram . In November last year, Avery became engaged to Sports Illustrated model Hilary Rhoda. The engagement came just a few months after tabloid reports that he was in a relationship with TV personality Andy Cohen, after they were photographed vacationing together in East Hampton. The pair made light of the reports on social media, before Avery deleted his posts.","Retired New York Rangers forward was set to appear in Negative is Positive off-Broadway on Thursday night .

"Chelsea target Filipe Luis has moved a step closer to leaving Atletico Madrid after the Spanish champions signed Granada full-back Guilherme Siqueira. The arrival of £8million Siqueira - who spent last season on loan at Benfica - on a four-year deal opens the door to the likely departure of left back Luis, who has been strongly linked to a move to Chelsea. Wanted: Atletico Madrid's Filipe Luis is a target for Chelsea, who he helped defeat in the semi-finals of this season's Champions League . New direction: Guilherme Siqueira has signed for Atletico from Granada having spent last season on loan at Benfica . ‘Siqueira will increase the competitiveness of the group,’ sports director Jose Luis Perez Caminero told the Atletico website on Friday. ‘He is a player that is very strong at set-plays, taking penalties, he has a lot of attacking qualities as well as great defensive ability.’ Atletico's defence conceded just 26 goals in 38 La Liga games as they won the title for the first time since 1996 and Luis - who the Blues have identified as a potential replacement for Ashley Cole - was an integral part of that feat.","Luis has been identified as potential replacement for Ashley Cole .

"For Chelsea, their magnificent start to the season goes on. Having won nine of their eleven games in the Premier League so far, Jose Mourinho's team are unbeaten and top of the table after Saturday's 2-1 win over Liverpool at Anfield. The Chelsea manager, however, believes a defeat will arrive at some time. Asked if Chelsea could go through the season unbeaten, he said: 'No chance. It's possible to be champions. We want to play for that. VIDEO Scroll down to watch post-match reaction from Jose Mourinho . Cesc Fabregas (left) played against Chelsea despite not being 100 per cent fit . Chelsea's players celebrate their 2-1 win over Liverpool on the team bus on the way home to London . Ramires (right) also was struggling with injury but played in Chelsea's win over Liverpool . 'But in modern football I don't believe in going unbeaten all season. It's a good start and we can keep this stability. 'We can lose tomorrow but my team is still the same. One day we will lose but the next game we will win again. 'We will play badly but we will recover our game because we are a strong team. We are a stable team. 'I have been in the game so long I know the defeat will arrive and the bad moment will arrive. We will be ready for that. 'We believe in everything. We are a happy camp. We believe in the players.' Mourinho paid tribute to midfielders Cesc Fabregas and Ramires as both players played with injuries. The Chelsea manager also believes that winning goal scorer Diego Costa will benefit from not playing for Spain over the coming international break. He added: 'I know every player was fantastic and some were brilliant but I give you Ramires and Fabregas in particular. Jose Mourinho was his normal animated self on the touchline at Anfield .

'They put themselves there for the team like other players will do in the future because the spirit is fantastic. 'Ramires has been in trouble for a while but he knew we needed him. Fabregas put himself on the line. He gambled. We all gambled. He can't play for Spain. He can go but he will come back. 'Spain have made a good decision with Diego. He is in good condition now. When they have him again they will have a good Diego and not a bad Diego.' William Gallas tries to clear a Luis Garcia effort off the line, only to see the goal awarded back in 2004 . Goal-line technology needed to to rule that Cahill (top) had equalised for Chelsea . Chelsea conceded a controversial goal at Anfield almost ten years ago in the Champions League, Luis Garcia's first-half effort being adjudged to be over line at the same end where Gary Cahill scored. Mourinho, for one, is certainly happy that technology is now available to help officials. 'I'm happy for everything to help,' he said. 'What has happened today is that everybody knows the truth. It's a goal. 'It's fantastic for the players and the crowd and the referee. It can be hard for him. Without the technology it can be difficult to make a decision. 'It's more difficult to use for other things like penalties. Sometimes it's impossible for the referee to give. 'Goal-line technology is simple. It costs money but it's simple.

'We have had a good run, hopefully we can come back from the international break and continue our form. We are proving hard to beat and long may that continue.'

"Global warming has been blamed for polar bears straying into residential areas to scavenge for food in recent years - but strolling through downtown Tokyo seems a stretch too far. As does this polar bears placid nature, as it ambles on a leash across a pedestrian crossing at the Shibuya Scramble. Footage of the bear and its female handler - a blond in a short skirt - has spread across social media in China as debate has raged about whether the bear is real or not, and just why it is out for a walk. Scroll down for video . The polar bear is walked across the Shubuya Scramble in Tokyo, led by a blond woman in a short skirt . Crowds gather around the busy crossing to take photos which are quickly uploaded to social media accounts . The stunt was performed by a Russian group called LASH, which is written on the handlers clothes . Most onlookers are convinced that the bear was either a robot or had somebody dressed up in a sophisticated costume underneath, as polar bears have been known to kill humans, and consent to walk the bear on the busy crossing would be unlikely to be granted. Nevertheless, the debate over whether the polar bear was real or not, did nothing to quell excitement about the unusual happening, or speculation around what the stunt might be promoting. The most popular theory was that it was a PR stunt for Lady Gaga, however, others suggested it was to promote everything from ice cream and cosmetics through to global warming. All that was known was that the woman and the men involved were wearing T-shirts with the words 'LALSH' printed on them. It is not known what, if anything, the stunt is promoting but LASH say all will be revealed later this month . The LASH organisation pose for pictures with the collared polar bear, as onlookers take pictures . A picture from the LASH organisation's Facebook page, which shows its members who have not been identifed . The group has a Facebook page which was set up in March, and shows photos of the polar bear being walked in Yokohama where it caused an equal amount of hysteria. The page, offers little insight into what the organisation is about, but a post says 'all will be revealed' in Shinjuku on October 24. As well as pictures of the polar bear, the page also shows those linked to the organisation dressed up in shirts printed with their logo. Polar bears are not known to be friendly to humans. In the past 20 years, six people have been killed by the animals in Canada alone and recent studies have suggested that attacks are on the rise. Climate change has been sighted as one of the main causes, as the bears are forced to roam further to find food.","The polar bear was walked across Shibuya Scramble in Tokyo .

"A single dose of antidepressant medication is enough to produce dramatic changes in the brain within three hours, a study has found. Volunteers had their brains scanned after taking the widely-prescribed drug escitalopram, marketed in the UK as Cipralex and Lexapro in the U.S. The drug is a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) and aims to boost the level of this ‘feel-good’ chemical in the brain. Scroll down for video . A single dose of the antidepressant escitalopram, marketed in the UK as Cipralex and Lexapro in the U.S., is enough to produce dramatic changes in the brain within three hours, researchers found . SSRIs are believed to change brain connectivity in important ways, but the effects had generally been thought to take place over a period of weeks, not hours. Study leader Dr Julia Sacher, from the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Germany said: 'We were not expecting the SSRI to have such a prominent effect on such a short time scale or for the resulting signal to encompass the entire brain.' The scans, which measured blood flow, showed that the drug reduced connectivity in most parts of the brain. But there was an increase in connectivity within two specific brain regions, the cerebellum and thalamus. Although SSRIs are among the most widely studied and prescribed antidepressants, it is still not entirely clear how they work. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter - a messenger chemical that carries signals between nerve cells in the brain). It is thought to have a good influence on mood, emotion and sleep. After carrying a message, serotonin is usually reabsorbed by the nerve cells (known as 'reuptake'). SSRIs work by blocking ('inhibiting') reuptake, meaning more serotonin is available to pass further messages between nearby nerve cells. SSRI drugs aim to boost the the level of the 'feel-good' chemical serotonin in the brain. Until now, the effects had been thought to take place over a period of weeks, not hours . Dr Sacher said: 'What we are seeing in medication-free individuals who had never taken antidepressants before may be an early marker of brain reorganisation.' She added the new findings represent an essential first step toward clinical studies in patients suffering from depression. The next step is to compare the brains of those in recovery and those of patients who fail to respond after weeks of SSRI treatment. Dr Sacher said: 'Understanding the differences between the brains of individuals who respond to SSRIs and those who don't could help to better predict who will benefit from this kind of antidepressant versus some other form of therapy. 'We hope our work will help to guide better treatment decisions and tailor individualised therapy for patients suffering from depression.' The research is published in the journal Current Biology. A widely-used antidepressant could help slow the onset of Alzheimer’s disease. Scientists say citalopram can significantly reduce the formation of plaques in the brain, which could go some way to warding off the disease. The U.S. academics admit it is too early to recommend the drug to Alzheimer’s patients, but dementia charities last night welcomed the ‘promising’ findings as providing ‘vital new clues’ about the disease. Plaque deposits are closely associated with declining memory and other symptoms of Alzheimer’s, so anything that can stop their build-up in the brain is likely to help ward off the condition. The research, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, found that a single dose of the antidepressant citalopram lowered production of the plaque protein amyloid beta by 37 per cent. The experiment was conducted in healthy adults aged 18 to 50, but the scientists, from the universities of Washington and Pennsylvania, hope the findings can be replicated in elderly patients. The drug, marketed in the UK as Cipramil, also had a dramatic effect on elderly mice, halting the growth of existing plaques and reducing the formation of new deposits by 78 per cent.","Drug was escitalopram, marketed in  UK as Cipralex and Lexapro in the U.S.

"Startled passengers on a New York train were left staring in disbelief at the sight of a man holding two enormous snakes during their evening commute. The unidentified man was seen casually handling the reptiles on the C train, according to a rattled eyewitness who took a couple of pictures on his phone. Eric Hertzog, a 26-year-old KTU radio producer got on the uptown subway at Canal Street and saw the man 'playing' with the snakes. Snake charmer: The unidentified man was seen casually handling the reptiles on the C train in New York whilst a brave woman sat beside him seemingly unfazed by the snakes in his hand . He told NBC 4 New York that the man had one python above his head which was hanging from a railing while another, around six feet long, sat between his legs. And he revealed that one unlucky passenger was so preoccupied with his day that he nearly sat down beside the man without noticing the snakes. But he soon realized his mistake and ran  to the other side of the subway car. Yet one brave woman appeared to be completely unfazed as she  calmly sat beside the man and browsed her e-reader during the hair-raising ride. After three more stops, the man put the snakes into two bags and placed them in his backpack before he coolly got off the train at 14th Street station, according to Hertzog. The stunned commuter posted two pictures of the bizarre incident on his Instagram account, on Monday, jokingly giving them the hashtags 'snakes on a subway' and 'sh*tgotreal.' He wrote: '11pm subway. Dude just letting his snake chill like its nothing. #snakesonasubway #SamuelLJackson #nope. However, the snake charmer is in breach of the The Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Transit Rules of Conduct under Section 1050.9(h)(1). It prohibits riders from bringing animals (aside from service animals) onto trains unless they are enclosed in a container and carried in a manner which would 'not annoy other passengers'.

"Kerry Welsh of Rancho Palos Verdes, California, hopes to bring a class-action lawsuit against in-flight internet provider Gogo for allegedly misleading consumers over recurring charges . In-flight internet provider Gogo is being sued by a man who hopes to bring a class-action lawsuit against the company for allegedly misleading consumers over recurring charges. Kerry Welsh of Rancho Palos Verdes, California, paid the company $39.95 for up to 30 days internet access on any airline on August 7, 2011. In his lawsuit he claims that 30 days later on Sept. 7, he was charged another $39.95 and then again every 30 days after that until at least Dec. 2012 - even though he didn’t use the service. Welsh claims he ‘received no communications from Gogo on a monthly basis notifying him of the recurring charges,’ according to the lawsuit filed last week in U.S. District Court in the Central District of California. His attorney, Michael Reese, told ABC News that he believes the lawsuit is important ‘to vindicate consumer rights.’ Reese said his client is trying to recover on behalf of the class members the money charged to those who ‘were misled to believe they were purchasing only a one-month pass, but were in fact charged every month thereafter.’ The lawsuit states that ‘every other class member purchased in-flight internet serve from Gogo prior to Dec. 31, 2012, using a registration website that had representations about the monthly cost of the service but had no representations about the recurring nature of charges for the service.’ Gogo offers internet services on more than 1,900 commercial aircraft and 6,000 business aircraft . Gogo declined to comment, citing the pending litigation. The company's website now clearly states that the charge for monthly service will be recurring, ‘but it did not do so in 2011,’ the lawsuit states. Gogo offers internet services on more than 1,900 commercial aircraft and 6,000 business aircraft. It currently charges $49.95 per month or $14 for an all-day pass. Those aircraft include all domestic mainline Delta Air Lines and nearly all of Delta's regional jets; all AirTran Airways and Virgin America flights; and select Air Canada, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Frontier Airlines, United Air Lines and US Airways flights.","Kerry Welsh is bring a class-action lawsuit against in-flight internet provider Gogo .

"England twice surrendered the initiative and ultimately had to settle for a draw in their Under 20 international with Canada at Bournemouth on Wednesday night. Aidy Bothroyd's team twice led in the contest, firstly through Arsenal's Chuba Akpom and then, with only five minutes left at the Goldsands Stadium, through local boy Baily Cargill. But Canada had an answer to the Young Lions, equalising initially through Michael Petrasso shortly after half-time and then claiming a share of the spoils in stoppage time through Jordan Hamilton.

The result meant England remain unbeaten under Boothroyd but there will be slight disappointment that they couldn't hang on. Since the former Watford manager was appointed, England have beaten Romania 6-0 and won a Four Nations tournament also involving Germany, Holland and Turkey last month. Boothroyd named a mixture of establish youth internationals and debutants, one of whom was Bournemouth defender Cargill, who understandably received a warm welcome from the near-7,000 crowd. The visiting Canucks gave England an early fright when Manny Aparicio darted through the England back line, only to fire off a tame shot that presented no problem for Exeter keeper Christy Pym.

He lined up to shoot but feinted and returned it to Baker, whose cross was headed home by Akpom. The Arsenal frontman saw a couple of other chances go begging before half-time as England continued to press, including a header that flashed inches wide of the post. Despite a defensive reshuffle to compensate for the loss of Liverpool's Lloyd Jones to injury, England continued to press after the break and Southampton man Harrison Reed forced a finger-tip save from Marco Carducci. But Canada left the hosts stunned when QPR winger Petrasso ran half the length of the field to fire home and equalise on 48 minutes.

But in the end it was Cargill, a defender, who restored their lead with a thumping header just five minutes from the end.

"Gary Cahill is honoured to have been named England vice-captain by Roy Hodgson as the Chelsea defender eyes another strong season which he hopes will culminate in silverware. The 28-year-old has been rewarded for his consistency for club and country by being formally named Rooney's deputy and received the armband when the Manchester United forward was substituted in England's recent wins over Norway and Switzerland. 'It's an ambition, but more of a dream, to captain your country,' Cahill said. 'It's still an amazing feeling every time you put on an England shirt to go out to play.

Cahill was speaking ahead of Goalmouth, which airs on Disney XD on Saturday, when he surprised Chelsea fan and competition winner Mark Castiglione, who is 11 and from Walton on Thames. 'He was happily surprised,' Cahill added. 'He was a crazy Chelsea fan and it was a fantastic opportunity for me to do something like that. We had a kick-a-bout in his back garden. It was a fantastic day. I really enjoyed it and I hope he did as well.' Cahill passed on some of his knowledge and skills. 'Basic ones,' said the central defender, laughing self-mockingly. Yet the former Aston Villa and Bolton defender showed his skill and value in the Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland in making a crucial block.

"A who's who of stars including Britney Spears and Steve Tyler have testified in support of a bill that would curb the freedom of paparazzi to take pictures of celebrities. The Aerosmith frontman plans to attend a legislative hearing in Hawaii on Friday on the bill that bears his name, when the country's Senate Judiciary Committee is due to consider the so-called Steven Tyler Act. More than a dozen celebrities have submitted testimony supporting the bill, including Britney Spears, Avril Lavigne, Neil Diamond, Tommy Lee and the Osborne family. Write caption here . The stars say paparazzi have made simple activities like cooking with family and sunbathing elusive luxuries and the bill would give them peace of mind. A publicist for the former 'American Idol' judge told The Associated Press on Thursday that Tyler submitted written testimony supporting the proposal, which would allow people to collect damages from someone who photographs them in an offensive way during their personal or family time. In the same text, the stars said: 'Providing a remedy to the often-egregious acts of the paparazzi is a very notable incentive to purchase property or vacation on the islands. 'Not only would this help the local economy, but it would also help ensure the safety of the general public, which can be threatened by crowds of cameramen or dangerous high-speed car chases.' Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie says he supports the intent of the bill but says it may need to be refined. He says the state attorney general will testify about legal concerns concerning the bill's language. Privacy: More than a dozen celebrities have submitted testimony supporting the bill, including the Osborne family, pictured . Sen. Kalani English, from Maui, says he introduced the bill at the request of Tyler, who owns a multimillion-dollar home in Maui. More than two-thirds of the state's senators have co-sponsored the bill. English says the bill will spur celebrity tourism to the islands, boosting Hawaii's economy.Opponents say the bill could be unconstitutional. Laurie Temple, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, said Thursday the bill would punish freedoms of expression protected by the First Amendment. She said lawmakers should support better enforcement of current stalking laws rather than passing new legislation. The National Press Photographers Association said the bill is 'well-meaning but ill-conceived' and tramples on constitutional rights. The New York-based organization represents numerous national media organizations with its letter, including the Society of Professional Journalists, the Associated Press Media Editors and the American Society of News Editors. Write caption here . Maui home: Sen. Kalani English, from Maui, says he introduced the bill at the request of Tyler, pictured, who owns a multimillion-dollar home in Maui . The Motion Picture Association of America also opposes the bill. Among other objections, the association says the bill could make it harder to police movie piracy, because there's no exemption for law enforcement who might want to take photos or video of people they're investigating. The bill would open up photographers, videographers and distributors to civil lawsuits if they take, sell or disseminate photos or videos of someone during private or family moments 'in a manner that is offensive to a reasonable person.' The bill doesn't specify whether public places, like Hawaii's beaches, would be exempt. The bill says it would apply to people who take photos from boats or anywhere else within ocean waters. English says the bill is not intended to limit beach photos. But he says Tyler has had paparazzi hide in his bushes to take photos of him inside his house. Photos of vacationing stars in swimsuits have long been a fixture in tabloids and celebrity magazines. The state's largest newspaper, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, published an editorial Thursday that called lawmakers who support the bill 'star-struck.' The newspaper said the bill might not affect only journalists. 'It could also make lawbreakers out of anyone taking photographs in public places, be it an ordinary photojournalist or someone with a camera phone,' the editorial said.","Aerosmith frontman Steve Tyler, who has a multi-million dollar home in Maui, plans to attend a legislative hearing in Hawaii on Friday on the bill that bears his name .

"Thomas Cook had been constantly ribbed over the name he shares with the famous travel agent. For years people have asked whether he can get them a free holiday. So, in a bid to get some 'compensation', the 26-year-old posted a cheeky request for a weekend in Paris on the company's Facebook page. Thomas Cook refused to give away the 'free holiday' but, seeing an opportunity to get over on their rivals, quick-thinking travel agent Lowcostholidays.com offered to take Mr Cook to Paris instead. Yesterday, Mr Cook, from York, uploaded a photograph of himself and friend Rob standing under the Eiffel Tower on the Reddit website. Bonjour! After asking Thomas Cook for a weekend in Paris to 'compensate' for the years of ridicule he had suffered because of his name, Thomas Cook, left, and a friend finally took the trip earlier this month...with rival firm Lowcostholidays.com . The snap, titled 'Benefits of sharing my name with a travel agent', shot up to one of the most-read items on the website and also went viral on Twitter. Mr Cook, the bass player in punk band The Fear, had taken to Thomas Cook's Facebook page last November to lament the ‘years of . ridicule and torment’ he had suffered because of his name. He added that the trip to Paris could help 'promote your brand by constantly keeping it in . peoples minds every time they speak to me' (sic). But when the travel agent declined, Mr Cook received an email from Charlotte Hunt at  Lowcostholidays sympathising with his plight. Missed opportunity: Mr Cook had posted a cheeky request on Thomas Cook's Facebook page asking for a weekend in Paris . Quick-thinking: Seeing Mr Cook's message to Thomas Cook, Charlotte Hunt from rival company Lowcostholidays.com stepped in to offer him the trip instead . Marketing representative, Ms Hunt wrote: 'Here at lowcostholidays.com we . completely sympathise with your suffering and if your name was . “lowcostholidays.com” we would certainly have accepted your request to . be sent away on a weekend in Paris. '...So how about we send you on that weekend in Paris?' Mr Cook finally took the trip earlier this month. Speaking to the MailOnline Mr Cook said he posted the request on the travel agent's Facebook page 'for a laugh'. 'I didn't think for a second that it would amount to anything at.' And when the offer from Lowcostholidays came through Mr Cook admits he didn't believe it at first. 'I thought it was some sort of joke,' he said. He added: 'Looking at the response on the Lowcostholidays' Facebook page, I'd say they definitely missed out. Companies need to be aware of how social networking works. Lowcostholidays saw an opportunity for some fun and good press and grabbed it.' Despite missing out on the golden PR opportunity, Thomas Cook posted a message on its Facebook page congratulating Mr Cook. They wrote: 'Just a quick one from the team . to say we're really pleased our namesake Thomas Cook looks like he's . had a great time on his free trip to Paris!!! 'We’d love to have helped him out (along . with all the other 'Thomas Cook's who write to us!), but we'd love to . help out ALL of our other loyal customers too... so unfortunately we . can’t give freebies to people who just happen to have fantastic names!' This is not the first time the rival companies have sparred. Mr Cook's campaign last November came weeks after Lowcostholidays was forced to axe an online advertising campaign that asked its customers whether they had ever been 'Thomas Crooked'. After Thomas Cook threatened legal action, Lowcostholidays were ticked off by the association of UK travel agents and tour operators.","Thomas Cook, 26, posted cheeky request for French holiday on Thomas Cook's Facebook page .

"Disciplined: Dame Judi Dench revealed she learns a new poem or word every day to keep her mind active . Dame Judi Dench has revealed she learns a new poem or word every day to keep her mind active after a survey found nearly half of pensioners were concerned about life in older age. The Oscar-winning actress, 79, joined actor Sir Tony Robinson and Slade frontman Noddy Holder for the poll of more than 2,000 people aged over 65, in which they were asked for their 'bucket list' of things they want to do before they die. Sir Tony, 68, best known as Blackadder's sidekick Baldrick in the BBC series, said he dreamt of becoming an internationally renowned professional gambler, according to telecare service provider Centra Pulse, which commissioned the research. Holder, also 68, revealed he wanted to travel the world in a yacht, while Dame Judi said she did not have a bucket list but she did learn a new poem or word each day, the company said. The YouGov poll found that flying a plane, speaking a foreign language and playing a musical instrument were the most popular skills over-65s wanted to master. But 40% of pensioners said they were worried about life getting more difficult as they grow older, Centra Plus said. Wendy Darling, the firm's managing director, said: 'Today's over-65s have a set of ambitions that would put most twenty-somethings to shame. It's so important that they are given access to the right support which will help them achieve their dreams.

'That's why we're urging older people not to forget about the care out there which will help them hold on to their independence for longer both inside and outside of the home.' Some 30% of pensioners said that travel was their top wish during retirement, with Australia as the most popular destination.

"The sale of alcohol has been banned in Broome after a woman was run over by a police car on Saturday night when police attended an alcohol-fueled brawl involving over 150 men. Police arrived at the Town Beach park in Broome after being alerted to the large group of locals drunkenly fighting at the popular picnic spot just after 4pm. The woman was allegedly lying on the ground and intoxicated, when an officer attempted to drive the police van forward in an effort to aid his colleagues contain the brawl and ran over her. Police arrived at the Town Beach park in Broome after being alerted to the large group of locals drunkenly fighting at the popular picnic spot just after 4pm . Kimberley District Superintendent Mick Sutherland said that those in the area were 'already fighting among themselves,' reported The West Australian. The woman has been taken to the Royal Perth Hospital hospital with six broken ribs and a fractured wrist, but her injuries are reported to not be life-threatening. Broome Liquor Accord has banned the sale of take-away alcohol in a voluntary motion, and Superintendent Sutherland said that the local police would continue a zero-tolerance approach to street drinking. Officers were reportedly afraid for their safety, with one officer punched in the head and neck and another hit in the face. Superintendent Sutherland said that enough was enough, and that Indigenous leaders needed to take responsibility for relaying the message to their community before someone was killed. 'An officer attempted to arrest one of the males and handcuff him, when the group surrounded police and set upon officers,' said Superintendent Sutherland. 'Indigenous leaders and elders need to get a very important message back to their people to behave themselves before someone is killed.' 'We will have to take two police vehicles off the road and replace them with two vehicles from remote communities, which will have to go without patrols.' 'This is the knock-on effect. These people are the first to contact us when they are in trouble, yet they attack our officers and equipment that are needed to keep people safe.' Police vehicles also suffered attacks, with many of the van windows broken and several panels kicked in. Four people were charged with offences including assaulting police, criminal damage and escaping legal custody. In September this year police attended to a drunken post-match brawl involving 300 people, during which police and local houses were pelted with glass bottles. The large fight also prompted a temporary ban on the sale of alcohol, with local community members expressing outrage over the violence, reported The ABC.","Police arrived at Town Beach park in Broome after being alerted to a drunken brawl which had erupted involving 150 people .

"The body of London McCabe, aged six, was found on Monday after his mother allegedly threw him from an Oregon bridge . A mommy-blogger who threw her six-year-old autistic son from a bridge told officers on the scene that voices in her head made her do it, police said today. Jillian McCabe, 34, has been charged with aggravated murder and first-degree manslaughter after allegedly throwing London McCabe from the Yaquina Bay Bridge in Newport, Oregon on Monday night. In a probable cause affidavit, which was issued on Tuesday prior to her arraignment, she called 911 after throwing her son 100 feet from the bridge. She reportedly told dispatchers shortly after 6pm that her son was 'in the water and gone'. She then described what her son was wearing along with his date of birth and details of his physical appearance. Mrs McCabe, whose husband Matt is battling multiple sclerosis, claimed voices in her head told her to throw her son, Newport Police Chief Mark Miranda told OregonLive. Another police officer revealed in witness statements that he had earlier passed the woman carrying a boy 'who seemed too big to be carried' on to the center of the bridge. Both Newport Police Department and the District Attorney's Office refused to comment on the case to MailOnline today. Kelly Beaudry, principal of Crestview Heights School in Waldport, said on Wednesday that London McCabe was filled with laughter and loved to sing. Ms Beaudry said the school will be dedicating a wall in his memory. Samples of his work with be posted and teachers can bring students to share their feelings. The state medical examiner's office said an autopsy was being conducted on the boy. Scroll down for video . Jillian McCabe (left), who was arrested after she allegedly threw her severely autistic son London (right) off  a bridge on Monday evening, had talked of 'pulling a Thelma and Louise' in the past . The mother allegedly carried her son to the center of the Oregon bridge and threw him into the water 100ft below on Monday night . Jillian McCabe had previously posted a number of blogs and videos on social media sites trying to raise money for the care of her son and husband, who was diagnosed with MS at the end of last year. In one video, recorded last year, the 34-year-old talked about how hard it was to raise her 'severely autistic' son and her desire to 'pull a Thelma and Louise'. McCabe, of Seal Rock, Oregon, was taken in after authorities discovered the body of her son London in Oregon's Yaquina Bay just hours after she allegedly threw him off the bridge. Family members close to McCabe describe the young mother as mentally unstable, and old videos and blog posts written by the woman seem to highlight her difficulties raising a child with severe autism. Loving father: In addition to her autistic son, Jillian's husband Matt McCabe (above) was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis last year . Family members said her downward spiral began soon after her father died and her husband, Matt, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. 'I'm sorry but to wake up one day and your whole world is topsy-turvy in a world that already was topsy-turvy with our son,' Jillian said of the situation in a 2013 video. 'All of a sudden, my husband who was your provider, the caregiver, my captain Kirk, and its hard to talk to him, and everything's hard.' In that same video, which she recorded and posted to thank her friends and people who were supporting her and her family financially after Matt lost his job, Jillian said; 'Matt and I love you guys. ... If we don't know you, we still love you. 'You are making this experience livable versus us pulling a Thelma and Louise, which I have totally thought about.' Other videos on her YouTube page show London throwing coins into a fountain, playing with his iPad on a hammock, and visiting his father in the hospital. Family members said that Jillian McCabe (above in her mugshot) was mentally unstable prior to allegedly throwing her six-year-old son from an Oregon bridge . Tanya McCabe, London's great-aunt, told NBC News: 'Jillian really struggled with her mental health and I know she was just out of her mind when this happened.' She added: 'It was terrible what we went through to get her the help she did get. We worked full-time to get her the services but obviously they weren't sufficient.' Tanya McCabe also said how shocked and heartbroken she was to find out what happened to London. 'Jillian was always so patient with him, and loving. She really had a lot of compassion for his condition,' she said. 'When he was screaming at the top of his lungs, which was the only way he could communicate, she didn't get upset at all. She would calmly comfort him, and I was amazed at how patient she was.' One family member, Tanya McCabe, described Jillian as 'patient and loving' when she was caring for son London who had severe autism (above) Matt McCabe (above with son London) has yet to comment on what happened. Mr McCabe was diagnosed with MS late last year . London's uncle, Andrew McCabe, also cited Jillian's mental instability as the cause of this horrific tragedy. He told NBC: 'The state of health care in the country and the lack of prioritization that we have especially for our mentally ill is appalling. And its heartbreaking and unfortunately there’s tragic results when people don’t get the help they need.' “She took him for a walk and did what she did,” he added. McCabe was arrested on charges of aggravated murder, murder, and first-degree manslaughter on Monday and is being held on $750,000 bail. The Newport Police Department said that Jillian McCabe had been located near the bridge and interviewed by detectives prior to the discovery of her son's body .

Ferguson has accused Hargreaves, who later joined Manchester City, of not having 'nearly enough determination' and claimed he opted 'for the easy choice' in training. 'When I signed him there was something about him I didn’t like,' added Ferguson. Read more from Ferguson on Hargreaves HERE . ON MARK BOSNICH...

"Miraculous recovery: Ex-England batsman John Edrich claims he recovered from cancer thanks to extracts of mistletoe . An international cricket career that spanned two decades, he won a reputation as a dogged and fearless batsman. Now, John Edrich is applying the same determination to fighting cancer – with a little help from mistletoe. The opening batsman, who played 77 tests for England between 1963 and 1976, has credited the experimental tumour treatment with saving his life. Edrich was given just seven years to live when he was diagnosed with a rare blood cancer in 2000. His health deteriorated so badly by 2005 that he told his wife Judith he was on the brink of death. Shortly afterwards, he heard about Stefan Geider, an Aberdeen GP who uses injections of mistletoe extract as a cancer treatment. He has never looked back. The 75-year-old is on the golf course three times a week and says he feels on top of the world. Speaking from his home in Ballater, Aberdeenshire, Mr Edrich said: ‘My quality of life was grim. I said to my wife, Judith, “This is the end”. I was so tired and lethargic, I couldn’t do anything. Then three or four days later a friend of a friend rang me and said I had to see Dr Geider because his treatment had worked wonders with another patient. There is some evidence that compounds found in mistletoe can have an effect on cancer cells, but there is little concrete proof of its value as a treatment at present. Scientists claim extracts from the plant: . The use of mistletoe extract is . widespread in Europe, particularly in Germany, but the third mistletoe . symposium in that country - reported on in the British Medical Journal - detailed a long . list of possible side effects from mistletoe, from nausea to herpes. The issue is also confused by the fact that mistletoe is sometimes used as a homeopathic remedy - which is never recommended as a key treatment for any type of cancer. ‘When I went along, I asked him whether he thought I could really get better and he said “You will be all right, John”. ‘The difference now is incredible. Mistletoe is not the final cure, but whatever is inside it certainly helped me. Without it, I don’t think I would be here today.’ Mistletoe has been touted as a cancer treatment since the 1920s and experiments show it can kill cancer cells in the lab. Doubts remain however about how effective it is in the human body. Dr Geider said that in some cases injections of the plant can help shrink tumours. Other patients seem to benefit from a better quality of life, more energy or a healthier appetite. The doctor, who is to carry out a clinical trial of the treatment on breast cancer patients, said: ‘Mistletoe has to my experience helped a lot of patients tremendously. ‘But it does not work for everybody – it’s not a miracle cure. We need to find out why the mistletoe works for some people, and not for others – that’s why we need the trials.’ Professor Steven Heys, an Aberdeen University cancer specialist who will help run the trial, told the BBC: ‘There isn’t any evidence that mistletoe does have an anti-cancer effect, in terms of prolonging the life of patients. Unusual methods: Dr Stefan Geider, left, a GP at Aberdeen’s Camphill Medical Practice, suggested the radical treatment using the traditional winter plant, right . ‘What it does do, possibly, is improve the quality of life of patients with breast cancer who are having chemotherapy. ‘Therefore I think it’s important to look and evaluate that and study it, in very good randomised controlled trials, conducted in a very controlled setting.’ Mr Edrich was diagnosed with Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia in 2000. ‘I hadn’t seen a doctor for about ten years, but I’d been feeling tired for a while,’ he said. ‘Having taken blood tests they discovered leukaemia. It was quite a shock. You can’t fight it. ‘I think we’ve got to be grateful for what we’ve had. I did something which I loved and had the ability to play cricket at the highest level.’ Mr Edrich’s fearlessness on the pitch saw him twice returning to the wicket to bat during the 1974-5 Ashes tour despite having his hand and later ribs broken by balls from Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee. He comes from a famous Norfolk sporting family and four of his cousins played first-class cricket. A scorer of 12 centuries for England, his best effort was 310 not out against New Zealand in 1965.","Treatment has been widely used in Europe - particularly in Germany .

He said: 'I thought Gareth Bale had an incredible season, I really did.

"The parents of missing student Lauren Spierer are outraged that their daughter's reputation has been tarnished by her boyfriend's parents who claim that the young woman was a drug user. Today marks the two-year anniversary of when the Indiana University student was last seen in 2011 after a night of partying with friends in Bloomington. Lauren's parents Robert and Charlene Spierer said on Monday that they were appalled by claims by the parents of Jesse Wolff that their daughter used drugs. Desperate search: Lauren Spierer, 20, has been missing for two years with very few leads into what happened to the 20-year-old Indiana student . Still missing: Student Lauren Spierer went missing on June 3, 2011 after a night of partying with college friends in Bloomington, Indiana . The Spierers told the Indy Star on Monday: 'We are appalled that the Wolffs have defamed our daughter knowing that Lauren will never have the opportunity to respond.' Their outrage came after Nadine and Alan Wolff, whose son Jesse was dating the young woman at the time she disappeared, called the Spierers 'liars' last week, adding: 'This poor little girl is not with us today because of her drug abuse.' The couple said that they were defending their son against the constant public scrutiny and calls from the Spierer family for Jesse, and three other young men who were the last to see Lauren, to come forward with information. Focus: Jesse Wolff, Lauren Spierer's boyfriend at the time of her disappearance, has passed a private polygraph test . The Wolffs' explained that the reason their son had not taken a police polygraph is because they did not trust law enforcement in the town. They told the paper that their son passed a private polygraph test. One of the young men who was last to see Lauren, Jay Rosenbaum, told investigators that she may have told him she had snorted a prescription drug on June 3, 2011. He also claimed that Miss Spierer . and a friend David Rohn had taken cocaine - but no evidence has been . found of this allegation. Police . have given no further information on whether investigators have made . any progress into what happened to the 20-year-old two years ago. Her parents say they still believe someone will eventually reveal what happened to her. Robert and Charlene Spierer say it would be devastating to never find their daughter even though they assume she is dead. Seeking answers: This surveillance photo is the last known image of Lauren. Several of the people to see her last have hired lawyers and stopped fully cooperating . The Spierers have maintained since . soon after Lauren vanished in the early hours of June 3, 2011, in . downtown Bloomington that several of the people who were with her that . night haven't fully cooperated with police. 'There's . a sense that someday, some week things will change for us. That someone . will have the strength, the crisis of conscience to come forward,' Robert Spierer told The Herald-Times of Bloomington. The 20-year-old apparel merchandising major from Greenburgh, New York, could have graduated with her college class last month. Indiana University President Michael . McRobbie asked those attending the commencement ceremony to keep Miss . Spierer and her family in their thoughts. Bloomington . police officials won't comment on the search other than to say the . department has received more than 3,000 tips, with some 160 of those . coming in this year. 'There's only so many ways you can say we continue to investigate,' police Captain Joe Qualters told The Indianapolis Star. 'We will not talk about people. We will not talk about evidence. We will not talk about the investigatory plan.' Robert . and Charlene Spierer spent weeks in Bloomington after their daughter . disappeared, and hundreds of volunteers joined searches around the city . and parts of the surrounding wooded countryside that is dotted with old . limestone quarries and lakes. Although . many of Lauren Spierer's friends and classmates have left Bloomington, . there were rejuvenated efforts in April to rebuild signs and hang new . posters to keep up awareness about her disappearance. Bloomington . firefighters rebuilt 20 large, wooden-framed signs to replace the . weathered billboards that were first erected two years ago. Members of a . Lauren Spierer Facebook group invited the public to distribute and hang . new posters and fliers. 'We do have local support,' Robert Spierer said. 'Her presence is in Bloomington.' The three young men who were last . seen with Lauren said earlier this month that her parents are harassing . them for information about their daughter's whereabouts. One of the young men . who was seen carrying her out of a restaurant towards his house is saying . that the Spierers are harassing him by repeatedly calling him demanding . information that he claims he does not have. 'We’ve done nothing wrong. If we’d . done something wrong, we would have been arrested already. All they’re . doing is hurting my career,' said one of those men Corey Rossman. Desperate search: Charlene Spierer, left, has kept the pressure on in the hunt for her missing daughter Lauren . 'It’s inappropriate the way they’re harassing people that are also victims in this case,' he told The Indianapolis Star. Rossman told the paper that he has had . to field phone calls from reporters, the Spierer's lawyers, and the . Spierers themselves, though the parents deny that they ever called the . young men themselves. 'Rob and I have never spoken to Corey Rossman,' Lauren's mother Charlene said to the paper. 'The . private investigators have never spoken to Corey. So I don’t know how . it is we’re harassing him other than asking him to talk to the . Bloomington police department. All of them.' Rossman is involved in the case is . because he accompanied Lauren to a bar, and then back to her apartment . at a building called Smallwood Plaza. While there, he was punched in the . face by another student. His . lawyer has previously said that Rossman does not remember anything . after the punch, but the building's surveillance footage shows Rossman . helping Spierer out of the building in the direction of his own . apartment. Plea for information: Lauren Spierer's mother Charlene asks the public to help find out what happened to her daughter, two years after she went missing in Bloomington, Indiana . Rossman, his roommate Mike Beth, and their neighbor Jay Rosenbaum are the final three people to see her alive. The . article in the Indianapolis Star paints Rossman as defensive, as he . said the following when a reporter called him at work: 'What do you . think, I’m doing drugs now? No, I’m at work. Don’t ever call again. If . you contact me again, you’re going to hear from my lawyer. Either way, . you’re going to hear from my lawyer.' No arrests have been made in relation to the young woman's disappearance. The . search for Lauren has taken one frustrating turn after another. When . the investigation began two years ago, five of her male friends, who police believed . could have offered insight into the final moments before her . disappearance hired criminal defense lawyers and stopped fully . cooperating with police. Speaking on Katie Couric’s daytime talk show in December, Lauren’s parents said that their daughter’s friends are impeding the search for her. They hypothesized that the friends have made a pact of silence. ‘Despite their claims of doing whatever they could do, the fact of the matter is they refuse to meet with us…they refuse to take a police polygraph, which we feel is important for a number of reasons,’ Mr Spierer said.","The 20-year-old Indiana University student was last seen on June 3, 2011 after going to a local bar in Bloomington .

"U.S. authorities have have arrested the head of the Gulf Cartel, one of Mexico's most violent drug trafficking rings, they said Tuesday. Juan Francisco Saenz-Tamez made his initial court appearance in Beaumont, Texas, on Tuesday, said U.S. Attorney John M. Bales. A federal grand jury indicted Saenz-Tamez in September 2013 on three drug and money laundering counts. Saenz-Tamez, 23, from the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, was arrested by federal agents on October 9 while shopping in the South Texas city of Edinburg. If convicted, Saenz-Tamez faces up to life in prison. Juan Francisco Saenz-Tamez, the boss of the notoriously-violent Gulf Cartel, is indicted with three drug and money laundering counts . Roberto Yzaguirre, Saenz-Tamez's attorney, did not immediately return a phone call or email seeking comment. Michele M. Leonhart, head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, said Saenz-Tamez was the newest leader of the Gulf Cartel following the 2013 arrest of former leader Mario Ramirez-Trevino. 'He moved steadily up the cartel ranks, working as a lookout, record keeper, plaza boss, and finally its leader,' Leonhart said. 'Thanks to the quick actions of DEA and our local partners, we were able to identify and safely arrest Saenz-Tamez while he was in the United States.' Saenz-Tamez does not appear on the U.S. State Department's list of Mexican narcotics fugitives or the Treasury Department's list of significant foreign narcotics traffickers. However, the DEA said its investigation revealed Saenz-Tamez's leadership role. Wendell Campbell, a spokesman for the DEA's office in Houston, said the cartel's leadership has seen various changes since Ramirez-Trevino's arrest. His arrest 'started a fragmentation where there has been no sense of strong stability, no consolidation of power. They have been fragmented. Basically the cartel is looking for strong leadership,' Campbell said. Mexican marines escort the former head of the Gulf Cartel, Jorge Eduardo ""El Coss"" Costilla Sanchez (C), as he is presented to the media in Mexico City in September 2012 . Raul Fernandez (C), alias ""El Lucky"" (The Lucky One), a suspected leader of the Zetas drug cartel, is presented to the media along with other suspected members of the Zetas in 2011 . The cartel's fragmentation, Campbell said, has been due to several reasons, including internal and external fighting and arrests by Mexican authorities. 'We have been watching his progression ... and when an opportunity came up with him being on this side of the border, we took the opportunity and grabbed him,' he said. Saenz-Tamez has not been a targeted cartel leader in Mexico. According to a Mexican federal official, Saenz-Tamez did not have a known criminal record in Mexico. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the subject. Asked who the Mexican government considered to be the Gulf cartel's current leader, the official said the government avoided getting into those discussions. Despite its leadership problems, the Gulf Cartel continues to control an important swath of cocaine and marijuana trafficking along the Texas-Mexico border. The body of a gunman suspected of cartel involvement lies in a field after a shootout with soldiers in the municipality of Patzcuaro, Michoacan, in 2011 .","Juan Francisco Saenz-Tamez, 23, faces up to life in prison after being arrested in Texas .

"Bernard Vann chose instead to enlist as a regular soldier rather than join the chaplaincy . He never forgot that he was a priest of God. So how did clergyman Bernard Vann reconcile his conscience with acts of war? His story becomes the focus of a new BBC documentary which will be aired on BBC Radio tomorrow as part of the World War One at Home project to mark the First World War Centenary. Rev Richard Coles, vicar of St Mary's in Finedon, Northamptonshire, gave up his career as a pop star in The Communards to become a priest. He decided to go in search of the real Bernard Vann and discover why he swapped a prayer book for a rifle and what was it like for a man of god to kill on the battlefield. Vann was born in High Street South, in Rushden in 1887, and played football for Northampton Town before training for the priesthood. He then went on to become chaplain of Wellingborough School. However, at the outbreak of war in August 1914, Vann chose instead to enlist as a regular soldier rather than face a delay to join the chaplaincy and was dispatched to France. Vann rose through the ranks in the 1/8 Sherwood Foresters, receiving the Military Cross as well as the Croix de Guerre. He was promoted to acting Lieutenant Colonel in October 1917, taking command for the 1/6 Sherwood Foresters. On September 29, 1918, Vann led the battalion across the St Quentin Canal, through dense fog and heavy fire. Bernard Vann standing at the back on the left with his brother Arthur Vann, far right and his mother Hannah Elizabeth Vann, sat in the chair knitting . The citation in the London Gazette adds that he 'rushed a field gun single handed and knocked out three of the detachment.' Four days later he was killed by a German sniper while preparing to lead another attack. Rev Coles, who went to Wellingborough School, said: 'When I started this I felt an affinity with him. 'He and I were both ordained. He and I both sang the same hymns and worshipped the same God in the same place in the school chapel. But then I began to feel the distance between us. Revd Richard Coles, vicar of St Mary's in Finedon, at the grave of Bernard Vann . 'I certainly wouldn't have the courage and stomach for the fight. 'If I'm honest I wouldn't have the relish and I'm wondering if Vann enjoyed his war-making more than I could imagine.' The grave of Bernard Vann which can be found in northern France . Rev Coles visited Arras in northern France where Vann led his men. Not only was Vann awarded the Military Cross twice, he was also awarded the Victoria Cross - the highest award for galintary which British forces can bestow. Rev Coles said: 'We are so used to the idea of clergy being mild figures. 'Meak and mild. But there is another version. 'The warrior Christian. Warriors for Christ. And Vann is very much in that category.' 'In his pack he always carried a cup and communion. 'Once a priest always a priest. He added: 'I don't think he could have asked for a more honorable death. 'That is a warrior's death.' When asked if he thought it would have been a difficult decision to fight on the front line, Rev Coles said: 'There would have been tensions. 'But he was convinced of the righteousness of this war and the British cause. In a way we might find difficult to imagine today. 'We do not know what it was like to have lived through the First World War.' The documentary on Bernard Vann will be aired on BBC Radio Northampton and BBC Look East on Thursday February 27 as part of the BBC’s World War One At Home project.","Bernard Van was born in Rushden, Northamptonshire, in 1887 .

"Scotland put in a gutsy performance but were ultimately seen off by World Cup winners Germany in Dortmund on Sunday night. Ikechi Anya equalised Thomas Muller's first half opener but the Bayern Munich hitman restored the host's lead minutes later with what proved to be the winner. Scotland gave Germany plenty of problems in the second half but the world champions stood strong and they could have added a third with Muller hitting the post late on to deny him a hat-trick. Here, John McGarry gives his verdict on the performance of the players. Celebrate: Ikechi Anya looks delighted with his goal but Scotland's joy was shortlived in Dortmund . GERMANY . MANUEL NEUER: Was thankful for Howedes blocking Bannan’s early strike then untroubled by Anya’s shot on stroke of half-time. Not a prayer as the Watford man motored through to equalise. 6. SEBASTIAN RUDY: In for Kevin Grosskreutz at right-back, the Hoffenheim man justified his inclusion with a gem of a cross that allowed Muller to head high beyond Marshall. Had the measure of Bannan whenever the Scots broke forward. 7. JEROME BOATENG: Bayern colossus had harder task to shackle Naismith than he probably imagined. Left for dead as Anya raced onto Steven Fletcher’s pass to score. 7. Justified: Sebastian Rudy came in at right back and marshalled Anya well in the first half . BENEDIKT HOWEDES: Outstanding sliding block by the Schalke man steered Barry Bannan’s onto the bar. Gladly strode into central midfield to release Kroos or Kramer. Booked. 7. ERIK DURM: Dortmund full-back had been savaged by Angel di Maria last week but this was a night for expression on the front foot. Muller ought to have converted his peach of a cross while Marshall did well to hold his fierce strike. 7. CHRISTOPH KRAMER: Holding role beside Kroos but frankly it wasn’t much of a two-man job. Was able to get further forward to help Reus as Germany attempted to dissect the Scots’ defence. 7. TONI KROOS: Madrid’s £25m man had James Morrison for company and the Scot ensured his opponent wasn’t allowed to dictate the pace of the game at will. Headed occasional scares off at the pass with wonderful recovery tackles. 7. Recovery: Toni Kroos dictated the play and would not let Scotland take a grip in midfield . THOMAS MULLER: Preferred to Mario Gomez, the Bayern man missed a pinch of a header inside eight minutes. Made up for that 10 minutes later with a looping header to beat Marshall then poached the winner. Yellow. 8 . MARCO REUS: Local hero was deployed off the front in the most fluid of formations. Twice tested Marshall from distance in the first half and miserly use of the ball contributed to the outcome. 7 . ANDRE SCHURRLE: Chelsea winger was asked to go at Alan Hutton down the left. Had reasonable success but found the Aston Villa man reserves his best stuff for his country. 6 . Contrast: Andre Schurrle strugged to get past Alan Hutton but Thomas Muller was at his best . MARIO GOTZE: Hero of the Rio final started at the point of the four-man attack but it was clear Low had given him licence to do as he pleased. Nippy, incisive runs and instant control of whatever was fired at him made him a thorn in the Scots’ sides. 7 . SUBS . Podolski for Schurrle (84) Ginter for Reus (90). Late sub: Arsenal's Lukas Podolski came off the bench for the final six minutes in Dortmund . SUBS NOT USED . Zieler, Weidenfeller, Grosskrautz, Sam, Rudiger, Gomez. Booked: Howedes, Muller . SCOTLAND: . DAVID MARSHALL: Justified his starting place over Allan McGregor with some superb saves in both halves. Helpless with goals. 7. ALAN HUTTON: A trademark surging run so nearly earned Naismith an equaliser at the start of the second half. More like himself. 6. STEVEN WHITTAKER: In at left-back after Andre Robertson’s injury and did fine in trying circumstances. 6. Close run thing: Steven Whittaker marshalls Thomas Muller away from goal - he didn't score...this time . RUSSELL MARTIN: Passed a pre-match fitness test, but couldn’t maintain his record of three straight clean sheets. 6. GRANT HANLEY: Blocked a certain second goal from Schurrle but toiled to deal with Muller. 6. DARREN FLETCHER: Played in a deep lying midfield role sweeping up but needs time. Replaced by McArthur. 5. Getting to grips: Darren Fletcher needs time and he wasn't gifted that by the relentless Germans . CHARLIE MULGREW: Finished the night with a red after two late bookings. Smashed superb shot offside upright early in game. 6. JAMES MORRISON: Lively and inventive, trying to bridge the gap between Naismith and midfield. 6. BARRY BANNAN: Had Scotland’s first effort of the match with a shot deflected over the bar. Replaced by Fletcher. 5. Struggle: Barry Bannan couldn't make use of his creative talents and was often pushed back . IKECHI ANYA: Another outstanding night for the little winger, scoring a quite brilliant breakaway goal for the equaliser. 8. STEVEN NAISMITH: So nearly drew the Scots level at the start of the second half. Ran tirelessly before making way for Maloney. 7. SUBS . Steven Fletcher for Bannan (58). 6. McArthur for Darren Fletcher (58). 6. Making an impact: James McArthur saw an effort on goal blocked as he looked to impress from the bench . SUBS NOT USED . McGregor, Gordon, Greer, Maloney, Bryson, McDonald, Burke, Reynolds, Forsyth, Martin. Booked: Hanley, Mulgrew, Morrison. Sent off: Mulgrew. Referee: Svein Oddvar Moen (Norway)","Ikechi Anya scored a brilliant equaliser in this Euro 2016 qualifier .

"It is not every day you get to see a 66,000-pound US Navy fighter jet zoom over the Golden Gate bridge. Luckily for amateur Bay Area photographer Rich Shelton, he had his trusty camera at the ready to capture the awe-inspiring sight of a Blue Angels stunt pilot soaring over the span of the iconic San Francisco landmark. The gorgeous shot of the No. 5 F/A-18 Hornet strike fighter suspended mid-air high above traffic and pedestrians - and perfectly framed by the unmistakable orange supports of the bridge - was taken earlier this month as the Blue Angels demonstration squadron was preparing for this year's San Francisco Fleet Week. Scroll down for video . Money shot: Bay Area resident Rich Shelton, 55, snapped this awe-inspiring image of a Blue Angel flying over the Golden Gate Bridge earlier this month . Steel swallow: The No 5 F/A-18 Hornet fighter jet dove and swooped over the famous span . Picture perfect: No. 4 jet is pictured perfectly aligned over one of the bridge's two 746-foot towers . Dry runs: The demonstration squadron was doing practice flights around the bridge October 9 in preparation for Fleet Week . Location, location, location: Shelton was able to make photos of the jets from a WWII-era bunker next to a toll plaza . Knowing the US Navy and Marine Corp demonstration squadron was going to be doing practice flights on the morning of October 9, Shetlon picked out a perfect spot by a toll plaza overlooking the bridge and trained his camera on the iconic span. The 55-year-old retiree from Tiburon did not have to wait long before the gleaming fighter jets painted blue and yellow appeared on the horizon, swooping down like graceful steel swallows. Shelton trained his camera equipped with a full-frame 70-400mm lens on the high-flying spectacle and began snapping away, capturing some two dozen shots of planes flying at top speed over and around the Golden Gate bridge in various formations. 'There's a fair bit of luck involved trying to catch a perfectly centered shot,' Shelton told Aol.com. Of all the dazzling pictures taken by Shelton that day, however, one stood out from the rest: the crisp, meticulously aligned shot of jet No. 5 piloted by Lt Cmdr. Dave Tickle hanging in mid-air some 400 feet above the span. Online phenomenon: Shelton's Blue Angels picture has gone viral on Facebook and Reddit . In formation: A total of 16 officers voluntarily serve with the Blue Angels, taking part in air shows and events like Fleet Week . A US Navy spokeswoman estimated that the F/A-18 Hornet would have been flying at a speed of about 350mph and at an altitude of 600 feet in that moment, making Shelton’s photographic feat all the more impressive. The Golden Gate Bridge's elevation is 220 feet, and the orange towers standing at both ends of the span rise to a height of 746 feet.

"An artist has transformed the head of a breast cancer patient into a stunning henna crown. World famous henna artist Ash Kumar, 35, spent over an hour giving a cranial makeover to Dipika Patel - who lost her hair in a battle with the disease. The crown was created by Ash for Breast Cancer Awareness Month in partnership with the Henna Heals project. Ash Kumar, 35, spent over an hour giving a cranial makeover to Dipika Patel - who lost her hair to cancer . Ash used Dipika's eye colour and skin tone as inspiration for the royal design . The project works with women who have lost their hair to promote empowerment, confidence and beauty. Dipika Patel, from Uxbridge, London, was diagnosed with breast cancer in May 2014. The 43-year-old decided to shave her head completely after her first treatment left her hair falling out in clumps. Dipika said: 'I think the main reason I agreed to the henna crown was to raise awareness for breast cancer in the Asian community in particular. 'It is brushed under the carpet and it isn't talked about a lot - you think its not going to happen to you.' The design was created for Breast Cancer Awareness Month in partnership with the Henna Heals project . Dipika has been supported throughout her treatment by her husband, family and four-year-old son - but often wears a scarf out on the street to cover her shaved head. Dipika said: 'When I was diagnosed I was very shocked and upset. 'People still think 'she's got cancer she's going to die' and it's still a lot of fear factor. 'When I start losing my hair it did upset me because it was coming out in clumps. 'All I was seeing was hair everywhere. I asked my husband to shave the rest of it off - I cried through the whole thing. The design totally transformed Dipika, who chose to shave her head when she began to lose her hair to regain control over the disease . Dipika was transformed by a web of brown gold and copper henna lines highlighted with crystals . 'I wanted to control the crisis, I didn't wanted it to control me so I chose to get rid of it in only one cut.' Ash used natural henna, crystals and body glitter to create the stunning crown, which will last around 12 days. He used Dipika's eye colour and skin tone as inspiration for the royal design. Ash said: 'I don't really choose a pattern but I'm inspired more by the personality. Ash used natural henna, crystals and body glitter to create the stunning crown, which will last around 12 days . 'I look at the colour and shade of their skin, which gives me kind of a palette to create a mood from it. 'Today I'm working on a project with Henna Heals, which is a wonderful movement. 'I created a henna crown for a wonderful lady to bring empowerment, confidence and beauty.' Dipika was transformed by a web of brown gold and copper henna lines highlighted with crystals. She cried with delight as she described how the transformation made her feel. Dipika said: 'It was amazing, I couldn't believe how beautiful it is, it is beyond all expectations - I can't take the smile off my face. 'I think the henna crown is very empowering and I'm going to be walking out of here without a hat on because I want everyone to see it. 'After everything you have to go through with cancer treatment something like this makes you feel beautiful.'","Dipika was diagnosed with breast cancer in May 2014 .

"Apple could be forced to scrap its latest iPhone connectors under plans to create a universal phone charger in the European Union. An EU Parliament Committee has voted to standardise power connectors so that everyone who buys a handset in the Union gets the same type of charger, expected to be a microUSB connector. Yet Apple, and firms including Asus, use specially-designed connectors that only work with their own handsets and, if the proposals are passed, could be forced to stop selling them in certain countries in order to comply with the law. Apple could be forced to scrap its Lightning connector, pictured, under plans to create a universal phone charger in the European Union. A Parliament Committee has voted to standardise power connectors so everyone who buys a handset in the Union gets the same type of charger . The proposal passed with a unanimous vote and was filed in a bid to reduce the amount of waste created by old or unused phone chargers. These changes would also benefit phone customers who could easily borrow or swap chargers, and could additionally be extended to include tablet connectors, too. However, this hasn't been passed as a law yet, and may not ever become law; it was a vote carried by a single group of MEPs. In a statement issued last week, the . committee announced it 'will decide later whether to start informal . negotiations with the Council in order to seek an early first-reading . agreement.' The majority of Android and Windows Phone handsets are charged using what's called a microUSB port - a smaller version of the USB ports used on many pen drives, laptops and PCs. Apple is renowned for having unique chargers. It introduced its Lightning connector in September 2012, which was shipped automatically with the then-new iPhone 5, and this connector replaced the Apple 30-pin connector that charged older models of the phone, as well as its iPods.

"It is a mystery that has puzzled biologists - including Charles Darwin - for 320 years. Biologists had been unable to work out how the Falklands wolf came to be the only land-based mammal on the isolated islands, which are 460km from the nearest land, Argentina. Previous theories have suggested the . wolf somehow rafted on ice or vegetation, crossed via a now-submerged . land bridge or was even semi-domesticated and transported by early South . American humans. Illustration of 'Dusicyon australis', the Falklands wolf,  from Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle. Researchers have now solved the mystery of how the wolf gor to the Flaklands - and say it skated across a frozen sea . The Falkland Islands wolf (Dusicyon australis), is also known as the warrah and occasionally as the Falkland Islands dog. It was the only native land mammal of the Falkland Islands until it became extinct in 1876, making it the first known canid to have gone extinct in historical times. The first recorded sighting was by Captain John Strong in 1690. He took one, but during the voyage back to Europe it became frightened by the firing of the ship's cannon and jumped overboard. When Charles Darwin visited the islands in 1833 he found the species present on both West and East Falkland, and tame, but numbers were dwindling and he predicted that the animal would join the dodo among the extinct within 'a very few years.' Islanders hunted it for its fur, and were also concerned it would attack sheep. Now, University of Adelaide researchers have found the answer - and say the animals skated across a frozen sea, probably chasing a penguin or seal. Researchers from the University’s . Australian Centre for Ancient DNA (ACAD) extracted tiny pieces of tissue . from the skull of a specimen collected personally by Darwin. The 320-year-old mystery was first recorded by early British explorers in 1690 and raised again by Charles Darwin following his encounter with the famously tame species on his Beagle voyage in 1834. The findings were published in Nature . Communications today and concluded that, unlike earlier theories, the . Falkland Islands wolf (Dusicyon australis) only became isolated about . 16,000 years ago around the peak of the last glacial period. 'The eureka moment was finding . evidence of submarine terraces off the coast of Argentina,' says study . leader Professor Alan Cooper. 'They recorded the dramatically lowered sea levels during the Last Glacial Maximum (around 25-18,000 years ago).' 'At that time, there was a shallow . and narrow (around 20km) strait between the islands and the mainland, . allowing the Falkland Islands wolf to cross when the sea was frozen . over, probably while pursuing marine prey like seals or penguins. 'Other small mammals like rats weren’t able to cross the ice.' The team also used samples from a . previously unknown specimen, which was recently re-discovered as a . stuffed exhibit in the attic of Otago Museum in New Zealand. The 'submarine terraces' that enabled the Falklands wolf to cross from Argentina during the Last Glacial Maximum (around 25-18,000 years ago). The image shows a shallow and narrow (around 20km) strait between the islands and the mainland . The yellow dots show the areas in Argentina the relatives of the Falklands Wolf were found, and the red marks its population on the island . 'Previous studies used ancient DNA from museum specimens to suggest that the Falkland Islands wolf diverged genetically from its closest living relative, the South American maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus) around seven million years ago,' said Associate Professor Jeremy Austin, Deputy Director of ACAD and co-lead author with Dr Julien Soubrier. 'As a result, they estimated that the wolf colonised the islands about 330,000 years ago by unknown means. 'Critically, however, these early studies hadn’t included an extinct relative from the mainland, the fox-like Dusicyon avus. 'We extracted ancient DNA from six specimens of D. avus collected across Argentina and Chile, and made comparisons with a wide group of extinct and living species in the same family.' ACAD’s analyses showed that D. avus was the closest relative of the Falkland Islands wolf and they separated only 16,000 years ago – but the question of how the island colonisation came about remained.

"Scientists claim to have to found an effective method for tackling the age-old school nightmare of 'mean girls' behavior. According to researchers at the University of Missouri, 'relational aggression ' - forms of non-physical bullying such as gossiping, rumor spreading, exclusion and rejection - can be reduced using an intervention strategy they've dubbed Growing Interpersonal Relationships through Learning and Systemic Supports (GIRLSS). Tested on 30 girls aged between 12 and 15, the ten-week program involved group counseling, role-playing, journaling and weekly goal setting, and was found overall to decrease relational aggression. Scroll down for video . You can't sit with us: In a new program developed by the University of Missouri, teens and their caregivers were given weekly social exercises which decreased 'mean girls' bullying of the non-physical variety . As part of the intervention method, students took park in one 70-minute session a week where they participated in a range of discussions and exercises. In addition, the girls' caregivers attended separate workshops and bi-weekly phone consultations during which they were taught better monitoring and supervision skills. A range of 'appropriate disciplinary responses' for dealing with mean girl-esque behavior were also suggested. According to Melissa Maras, co-author of the study and assistant professor in the Department of Educational, School and Counseling Psychology at the university, parents and teachers should keep their eyes open for relational aggression, so they don’t 'unknowingly contribute to the negative behaviors.' Statistically, teenage boys are twice as likely to bully as teenage girls, or at least twice as likely to be reported for bullying. It is widely speculated, however, that boys, who tend to be more overt and physical in their approach, are simply more easily detected than 'mean girls' who display relational aggression. 'This study represents a first step in helping school personnel meet the intervention needs of a diverse group of relationally aggressive girls,' Dr Maras said. Co-author Connie Brooks, also an assistant professor, added: 'Good outcomes can happen when priorities are set by schools and families to prevent and eliminate relational aggression.' Indeed, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, bullying stops in ten seconds, 57per cent of the time ,when an adult or fellow student immediately intervenes. Researchers at the University of Missouri now hope to expand the GIRLSS program into more schools in a bid to manage what is a pretty universal, if sometimes overlooked, part of the nature of teenage girls.","'Mean girls' bullying is characterized by non-physical behaviors such as gossiping, rumor spreading and exclusion .

"Joleon Lescott has confirmed that he is set to leave Manchester City after winning every domestic honour with the club and fired a parting shot, saying: 'Not bad for a money grabber!' The England defender is still hurt at how he was portrayed when he joined City from Everton for £22million in August 2009, with furious Everton fans claiming that a £100,000-a-week salary was his only motivation. But after winning his second Premier League title on Sunday, Lescott believes he has been vindicated after reaching the end of his five-year contract. Moving on: Joleon Lescott has confirmed he will leave Manchester City at the end of his contract this summer . Happy memories: Lescott won two league titles, the FA Cup, the League Cup and the Community Shield during his time at the Etihad . ‘Two titles, FA Cup, League Cup, Community Shield, not bad for a money grabber eh?’ he said. ‘Not a bad decision in the end.’ Asked if there was a feeling of sadness to be leaving the champions, he added: ‘Definitely. The way it all started and speculation about my reasons for coming here. Hopefully I’ve shut everybody up now.’ Lescott made 24 appearances for City this season but has fallen down the pecking order of centre-back partners for Vincent Kompany behind Martin Demichelis and Matija Nastasic, who has been out with a knee injury. The 31-year-old almost joined West Ham in the January transfer window and has been in talks with Turkish club Besiktas as he weighs up his next move. ‘It is the end,’ he said. ‘I know I’m going to be leaving. We’ve had a good relationship, this club has been a big part of me. I know the business side of it. We’ve been successful and I hold no grudges. ‘Everyone talks about how you look back when your career has finished on what you’ve won – I can look back and say I’ve won some amazing things. ‘Now I’m . going to see what’s best for me and my family and then make a decision. I’ve spoken to a number of clubs in different countries but there’s been . no decision made. I want to get it sorted soon. I don’t want to leave . it until after the World Cup but at the same time I won’t rush. ‘I . won't go anywhere that I'll win more trophies than I do here. It will . be a different mindset wherever I go. They’ll have goals and ambitions. Now I’ll just go and enjoy playing some games.’ Criticised: Some Everton fans accused Lescott of being a 'money-grabber' after his move to City in 2009 . Fresh faced: Lescott fell out of favour after the arrival of Matija Nastasic (left) in the summer of 2012 . Lescott admits that he is somewhat mystified by the way he fell out of favour at City after helping them win the title under Roberto Mancini in 2012, and in particular how he lost his place following Nastasic’s arrival from Fiorentina. ‘It was a bit strange,’ he added. ‘I came back from Euros 2012 as high as I could ever be after winning the league and scoring for England at the Euros. ‘I came back and read reports that my confidence was dented by the signing of Nastasic. He did well, Matija, but my confidence couldn’t have been any higher. ‘Now I’m . going to see what’s best for me and my family and then make a decision. I’ve spoken to a number of clubs in different countries but there’s been . no decision made. I want to get it sorted soon. I don’t want to leave . it until after the World Cup but at the same time I won’t rush. ‘I . won't go anywhere that I'll win more trophies than I do here. It will . be a different mindset wherever I go. They’ll have goals and ambitions. Now I’ll just go and enjoy playing some games.’ New start: Lescott wants to find a new club where he will play games more regularly than at City . Gareth Barry, Scott Sinclair, Micah Richards and Jack Rodwell could all leave the Etihad this summer at a time when City face Financial Fair Play sanctions from UEFA that could see their foreign player quota for the Champions League cut by four next season. ‘As far as I'm concerned it’s the end,’ said Lescott. ‘If something changed then great, but if not there are no hard feelings between me and the club. I’ve had a great relationship with them. ‘I’d have to weigh it up. There’s a lot to consider. This club is going to win things over the next couple of years and I’d like to be a part of that. I didn’t play as often as I’d have liked but I still made nearly 25 appearances, so I’ve played my part.’","Lescott will officially leave Manchester City when his contract ends next month .

"Several Syrian friends of an American aid worker held by the Islamic State group and threatened with decapitation called Saturday for his release, saying he converted to Islam and was helping Syrians. The friends of Peter Kassig, who became Muslim while in captivity and changed his name to Abdul-Rahman Kassig, held a news conference in the northern city of Tripoli, where Muslim militants and Lebanese troops clashed last month. Kassig, a 26-year-old former Army Ranger, was helping victims of the Syrian civil war when he was captured last year. Release him: Syrian refugee Amjad Moghrabi stands in front of a photograph of his colleague, American aid worker Peter Kassig, 26, who converted to Islam while in captivity . One of the friends, Amjad al-Moghrabi, told reporters: 'We are demanding the Islamic State to release him, if they know Islam. He is a Muslim and has not participated in what his country is doing.' He was referring to airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. Dr. Ahmad Obeid, a friend of Kassig said 'our demand is to release him and to return to his family because as a person he helped us and we should ask for mercy for him.' 'He is unfortunately detained so we are calling for his freedom because he supported our cause and we cannot leave him and let them hurt him,' Obeid said.

"The man who followed the man who followed Sir Alex Ferguson was always meant to be the lucky one and on Monday that stroke of good fortune officially went the way of Louis van Gaal. Appointing Manchester United’s first continental manager has been a protracted process, and one that will not have pleased the Dutch FA so close to the start of the World Cup, but the club feel they have made the right choice this time. The situation Van Gaal inherits at Old Trafford could not be more different from the one that faced his predecessor 12 months ago. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal put Holland through their paces . The future's bright: Louis van Gaal, pictured here with Robin van Persie, is remoulding his backroom staff . Dutch of class: Van Gaal will first coach Holland at the World Cup before moving to Old Trafford . Values: Van Gaal has a record of bringing through young talent at Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich . While many feared that the only way for David Moyes was down, in the short term at least, after the glittering success of the Ferguson era, the feeling now is that it cannot possibly get any worse under the new man. Turning things around will not be easy. Van Gaal must revive a club that tumbled from Premier League title winners to seventh place over the course of a season. The top four and a return to the Champions League has to be his aim. He must restore the confidence and swagger to a team who became almost frightened of their own shadow and he must get the best out of players who, for one reason or another, let down Moyes so badly. Some of them will no longer be around when the 62-year-old Dutchman officially takes charge in July. And there is a £200million kitty available to replace them. Gone: David Moyes (pictured with LMA chief executive Richard Bevan) was sacked by the club in April . Safe pair of hands: Ryan Giggs has been taking care of business at Old Trafford in the interim . United . couldn’t be sure if Moyes was the man to spend that money but, in Van . Gaal, they believe they have an established statesman of European . football; a coach who has been in charge of Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern . Munich and has the success to show for it. There will be no issues . convincing the United players of his credentials. It . was notable that the talks with United chief Ed Woodward and Ryan Giggs . last week took place on Van Gaal’s terms, on Van Gaal’s turf in . Holland. At his penthouse apartment on Queen Astrid  Boulevard in . Noordwijk, King Louis held court and told his guests what they wanted to . hear. ‘He . will have spelt out to United the Van Gaal philosophy,’ said a source . close to him. ‘Attacking, dominant, pressure football.’ Van Gaal (right) is a big character with a big ego. Some are concerned that it might be too big.Even . Woodward referred to a ‘larger than life  character’ on Monday and some . people at the club are already bracing themselves for a bumpy ride. United suffered through their lack of activity in the transfer market last summer and cannot afford to make the same mistake again. Many of the targets remain the same, but Van Gaal is bound to have plans of his own and they must be hatched around the restrictions of a World Cup.

Of the . current United squad, what now for the likes of Ashley Young, Nani and . Javier Hernandez? Can Van Gaal get the best out of Juan Mata and Shinji . Kagawa? Some players could face a very different future now that he has taken over, and none more so than Robin van Persie. The . striker never bought into the Moyes project, and it is unlikely that he . would have stayed around had the Scot survived his first season. Now . the Holland captain is being tipped to be Van Gaal’s skipper at United . as well, although where that leaves Wayne Rooney is an intriguing . question. On the move?

Moyes and he was set to inherit the armband from Nemanja Vidic. Negotiating that particular minefield will be an early test of Van Gaal’s skills. He has already made a wise move by appointing Giggs as his No 2. Keeping a United icon and someone who knows the club inside out has gone down equally well in the boardroom and the dressing room.

"Over 10,000 London taxi drivers are planning a mass protest over a new app which encourages people to become their own taxi service. The London cabbies are planning to meet in June against the app by Uber Technology Inc at a London landmark, which has yet to be decided. Steve McNamara, the Licensed Taxi Drivers’ Association’s general secretary said cab drivers are against the Uber app because it allows drivers to carry passengers without following the same rules as other services, giving them an unfair advantage. Steve McNamara: The Licensed Taxi Drivers Association's general secretary said the issues over the app are about a good old British sense of fair play . ‘All we’re saying is if you want to come to London and operate the business model you’re operating, you should operate within our laws,’ McNamara told Bloomberg. ‘This is about a good old British sense of fair play. It’s not cricket.’ However, the app looks set to shake up the taxi market as it has given private drivers the ability to charge for rides without the constraints that taxi drivers tend to face. The company was valued at $3.5billion last year after raising cash from Google Inc.’s venture-capital arm and private-equity firm TPG Capital. Threat: Uber's app is marketed as a way for drivers to start their own taxi business . Black cab protest: Cab drivers are against the app by Uber Technology Inc because it allows drivers to carry passengers without following the same rules as other services . Uber is marketed as a way for drivers to start their own businesses by showing profiles of top drivers on its website. The website shows ordinary people like a single mother who used the app to start her own business to make money and a student who used the app to make money on weekends, along with a man who left his job to drive passengers around San Francisco. It wants to show that ordinary drivers can become professional drivers without training, licencses or  prior experience. Uber uses a phone's GPS to detect a location and connects them with the nearest available driver even if they don't know the exact address. When a customer requests a ride, a driver will let them track their location on the map. Uber texts customers when their ride arrives. The driver’s name and car details appear in the app, and they can message or call if they need to. Customers can view rates in their city in the app and enter a pickup and drop-off locations to get a fare quote for the trip. Uber users don't need cash when they ride with Uber. Once they arrive at the destination, the fare is automatically charged to your credit card on file, and they e-mail a receipt. Customers can split the fare with friends. Other apps like Hailo are slightly different to Uber as they recruit taxi drivers. But it has been met with fierce protest in different countries by taxi drivers who are upset that these drivers do not have to pay the same fees, permits or licences that taxi drivers do. In France, French President Francois Hollande attempted to impose a 15-minute pickup delay on Uber and other private car services, which was struck down in February by the constitutional court. Parisian drivers staged their own protest against the app by blocking traffic from airports expressing their frustration that the private taxi drivers do not have to buy a taxi permit that costs more than €200,000. In Berlin, the taxi association said . that Uber hurt competition by violating rules that force limousine . drivers to return to a base after delivering customers. In April, a . court banned taxi services that use the app, though the injunction . wasn’t enforced at the time. Cars in Brussels that use the app will . be subject to a €10,000 ($13,863) fine after a local court ruled . against Uber cars last month. European Commission Vice President Neelie . Kroes called the ban ‘crazy’ and anti-competitive. But Mr McNamara said that London cab drivers like their European counterparts also see the app as  unfair. Crazy: Neelie Kroes European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes called the bans in certain parts of the EU 'crazy' and anti-competitive . ‘For me to persuade 10,000 guys to take a day off work shows you the strength of feeling,’ he said. ‘They’re not a commercial threat to us. It’s a sense of fair play.’ The Licensed Taxi Drivers’ Association represents almost half of London’s 24,000 cabbies who drive the city’s black taxis. Another sticking point over the app is that private hire vehicles, such as Uber’s cars, aren’t allowed to have meters because they’re pre-booked and can quote a fare in advance. The rule is meant to prevent companies from charging different amounts or surprising a passenger with an unexpected charge, he said. However, the Uber app does have a built in meter. McNamara added: ‘Uber drivers also don’t always have an operators’ license, which means that they aren’t supposed to take customers’ bookings themselves.' A spokesman for Uber said: ‘Uber is pro rider and pro driver -- we are all about keeping London moving with our innovative app at great prices.’ The San Francisco based app has fought back against the backlash from cab drivers saying that it has all of the licenses needed for private hire cars in London. Uber said it already provides a $1million commercial policy during trips and $1million of coverage for . uninsured and under insured motorists. The firm said that it is abiding by Transport for London’s rules and Transport for London said in a statement that Uber is eligible for a licence. But Uber is facing a growing barrage of criticism at home. Commissioner Dave Jones of the California Department of Insurance said in a statement last month that the app was ‘encouraging non-professional drivers to use their personal vehicles to drive passengers for a profit, a risk which personal automobile insurance simply does not cover.’","London cab drivers plan to boycott an app by Uber Technolgies Inc.

"A nurse yesterday told how her elderly mother starved herself to death in what the pensioner considered her only legal way to exercise her right to die. Bronwen Davies said she initially struggled to reconcile feelings of extreme anger with a desire to support Jean Davies’s right to die ‘on her own terms’. Twice-widowed Mrs Davies, 86, a long-term right-to-die campaigner, had been battling an increasing number of chronic health conditions – but was not terminally ill – when she ‘reached a point where she didn’t want to go on’ at the end of this summer. Jean Davies, 86, a life-long right to die campaigner, poses for a portrait with her daughter Bronwen at her home in Oxford September 2014 . The former maths teacher began refusing food on August 28 – five weeks before she eventually died on October 1, just hours after being visited for the final time by a GP who had agreed to treat the symptoms of starvation and dehydration. She stopped drinking water on September 16. Yesterday her daughter, who is married but has kept her maiden name, said: ‘I was very angry when my mother first told me of her decision. 'However, I recognised that this wasn’t about me. All the family did. We are all respectful of the fact that it was her life and her choice.’ Miss Davies added: ‘My mother was a fiercely independent lady who had the capacity to make this decision. 'She had been talking about doing this for the last two or three years, if her health deteriorated – although that’s not to say we ever thought it would actually happen. She was becoming increasingly restricted in what she could do. A portrait of Jean Davies aged 15 in 1943, left, and her daughter Bronwen Davies, 60, right . 'Her quality of life was diminishing and eventually she was diagnosed with one chronic condition too many.’ Assisting or encouraging a suicide remains a criminal offence in the UK. But last week Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, issued new guidance to Crown Prosecution Service lawyers suggesting doctors or carers in such cases should only be prosecuted if they ‘may have exerted influence on the victim’. Miss Davies, 63, from Cardiff, said her mother suffered from fainting episodes throughout her life, which last autumn progressed to her collapsing unconscious in the middle of the night. Mrs Davies also suffered chronic back pain. Although she was still travelling independently around Britain by train until the spring, and was technologically literate enough to order her own grocery shopping online into the summer, she suffered a further ‘episode of acute ill-health’ in May. The former maths teacher began refusing food on August 28 – five weeks before she eventually died . Miss Davies declined to go into further detail about the nature of her ‘remarkable’ mother’s various health conditions. Mrs Davies had been a right-to-die campaigner for decades. A former chairman of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society, she wrote a book in 1997 which called for doctors to be allowed to help patients die. In the absence of British laws permitting assisted dying, and unwilling to travel to the Dignitas assisted suicide clinic in Switzerland, she believed starvation was the only legal option of ending her life available to her. She feared an overdose of medication would not work. Jean Davies might have been able to find a doctor to help her commit suicide under new prosecution guidelines slipped into operation last week which mean a doctor who assists a suicide is unlikely, in the right circumstances, to be prosecuted. Until last week the rules said that any doctor, nurse, medical professional or carer who takes part in an assisted suicide should be prosecuted under the 1961 Suicide Act. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders altered the guidance last week in a move condemned by anti-euthanasia campaigners. Her predecessor Keir Starmer published guidelines in 2010 on who would be prosecuted for helping a suicide which said broadly that no one would be prosecuted if they acted out of compassion rather than greed or malice. However, they warned that a medical professional would be prosecuted if the suicide victim was ‘in his or her care’, whether or not they were being paid. Mrs Saunders has now said the phrase ‘in his or her care’ will apply only to doctors who know the suicide victim and have been in a position to influence their thinking. Lord Falconer’s Assisted Dying Bill would allow a doctor to provide lethal drugs to someone who is terminally ill and expected to die within six months. Mrs Davies, from Oxford, contacted the Sunday Times four weeks into her fast. In the interview published yesterday, she described her situation as her body shut down as ‘hell’. She added: ‘I can’t tell you how hard it is. 'You wouldn’t decide this unless you thought your life was going to be so bad. It is intolerable. What alternative do I have?’ She admitted that her family ‘don’t want me to die’, but added: ‘They give me absolute right to make my own choices.’ The former choir singer began starving herself after enjoying a final piece of a cake she had baked herself. When she stopped drinking water it left her mouth so dry she had difficulty talking. Miss Davies said her mother hadn’t realised it might take weeks rather than days to die after she stopped drinking. In her final weeks, Mrs Davies was looked after by her four children and two grown-up grandchildren, who took it in turns to visit. She died peacefully at home with Miss Davies and her grandson at her side. Miss Davies yesterday declined to identify the Oxford GP surgery which treated her mother. But her doctor, a Christian who does not believe in assisted dying, told the Sunday Times he had treated her after consulting his defence union who ruled ‘you cannot force someone to eat if they have capacity’. Miss Davies said the case had been referred to the coroner, who was waiting for medical reports before deciding whether an inquest would be necessary. Sarah Wootton, chief executive of Dignity in Dying, said the group supported Lord Falconer’s Assisted Dying Bill, which would enable competent adults who are terminally ill to request assistance to end their own life. Dr Peter Saunders, campaign director of Care Not Killing, said he feared Mrs Davies’s case could be ‘seized upon by the pro-euthanasia lobby to further their agenda of legalising assisted suicide and euthanasia’.","Jean Davies, right-to-die campaigner from Oxford, had chronic health issues .

"Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore has warned that the Football Association's proposal for Premier League B teams to be entered into the football league would decimate and damage English football. FA chairman Greg Dyke revealed plans to allow B teams made up of young professionals to be entered into a new division where they will face teams at Conference level in an attempt to address the lack home-grown British players reaching the top level. Scudamore has conceded that Dyke is right to address the problem, but insisted that there are other solutions than the one the FA has presented. Concerned: Premier League CEO Richard Scudamore believes B teams would damage the Football League . 'I have some real concerns we shouldn’t be looking to infiltrate and damage the pyramid and therefore I would like to think we should exhaust all other options, all other ideas,” he told the Guardian. 'The commission report has hit upon an issue that we are all faced with – a big challenge as to how do you take this huge investment that we make in youth up to the age of 18? How do you get all that talent through and convert it into first-team players able to hold their own in the Premier League and able to compete for England? 'That’s a challenge we recognise. We know we have to address it and we are going to sit down and yet again re-examine everything we do in terms of trying to overcome that challenge. 'So I have no issue with the identification of, if you like, ‘the problem’, but I have been on record very recently as saying I think the English pyramid is one of our unique strengths and I would like to think we would be able to come up with a solution which doesn’t mean the decimation or the infiltration or the damage really of something precious.'

"A Church of England charity has described England as one of the most unequal countries in the western world. Church Urban Fund published research of the vast differences between the richest and poorest neighbourhoods in England. All ten communities at the bottom of the list are in the north, with five of them in Liverpool. All but one are situated in the North West of England with the 10th in Middlesbrough in the North East. Poorest in the country: Boarded up shops in Toxteth, Liverpool, the most deprived area in England according to research . Stark contrast: A cricket match at affluent Alderley Edge in Cheshire which made number two on the top ten richest communities list . The worst ranked community is Toxteth in Liverpool where 62 per cent of children and 52 per cent of pensioners live in poverty. Ninth worst is South Shore, Blackpool where the life expectancy for men is 66 years – the overall in Britain is 78.4. The figures are in stark contrast to the most affluent area, Camberley Heatherside in Surrey where only six per cent of children and three per cent of pensioners live in poverty. Only two of top 10 least-deprived communities were in the north of England - in Wheldrake, York and Alderley Edge, Cheshire. 1.  Camberley Heatherside, Surrey2. Alderley Edge, Cheshire3.

South Shore, Blackpool10. Cannon Park, Middlesbrough . The Church Urban Fund’s research also show how in some cases the difference between a child growing up in a top ten or a bottom ten community can be a matter of miles. Harpenden, Hertfordshire, ranks as the seventh most affluent in the country but is situated only six miles from bottom ten performer Farley Hill in Luton. The findings were calculated at Church of England parishes by comparing life expectancy and poverty rates among children, pensioners and those of working age. Paul Hackwood, chairman of the CUF trustees, said: ‘We live in one of the most unequal countries in the western world, where babies born within a few miles of one another can have widely differing life expectancies - of 10 years or more. ‘We urge people to go online and try out the tool and find out where their local community ranks in terms of poverty indicators. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg delivered his speech on social mobility, at the Royal Society, in central London today . ‘We hope it will create a much greater awareness of poverty in England and bring people from affluent and less affluent areas together to think about what could be done to support those that are living in poverty.' The figures and Mr Hackwood’s statement ties in neatly with an announcement by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. New figures on social mobility in Britain will be published annually to expose stark gaps in life chances. The studies will chart progress in making society fairer by revealing children’s development. The Deputy Prime minister said: ‘We must create a more dynamic society. One where what matters most is the person you become, not the person you were born.’ ‘These are challenging times but that doesn’t mean we can give up on making society fairer and helping people get on in life.’ Mr Clegg, who appeared on ITV's Daybreak said that the figures published by the Cabinet Office today will be lifting a lid on an ‘absolute scandal’. 'In our country more than many other countries, where you are born and certainly what your background is seems to determine your subsequent life. ‘We are measuring that in lots of different ways.’","Research published today show top ten richest and poorest communities in England.

"Convictions for benefit fraud have soared by 40 per cent in the last two years, MailOnline can reveal. The rise follows a decision to grant new powers to investigators, allowing them to access bank account records and credit reference checks to see if someone is earning while claiming sickness benefits. Officials can also use Sky TV bills to establish if a woman in receipt of benefits as a single mother is wrongly claiming to be living alone – by discovering their partner has signed up to a sports package at the same address. Scroll down for video . Today Michelle Taylor, 40 was convicted of claiming £21,008.54 in benefits after claiming to being unable to walk but was filmed walking to the gym. This month football manager John Alexander, 68, (right) admitted claiming nearly £7,000 for being 'unable to walk' but was caught playing and . training with his team . Ministers yesterday warned fraudsters . that they will ‘have to pay back their ill-gotten gains’ as the . Department for Work and Pensions revealed that the benefits fraud bill . topped £215million last year. Figures showed that 9,861 benefit . cheats were convicted in 2011-12, up by 40 per cent on the 7,040 tally . of 2009-2010, the last full year of the Labour government. Over the same period, around 7,000 . people a year received ‘administrative penalties’. Almost 16,000 were . given cautions in 2011-12, up by around 900 on 2009-10. Welfare reform minister Lord Freud said benefit cheats will have to 'pay back their ill-gotten gains' The sharp rise in convictions is despite  the number of cases referred to specialist teams remaining relatively stable. The DWP said the increase in convictions was the result of a more aggressive stance and investigators having more powers. Tackling welfare reform is one of the . Government’s top policy priorities, and it  gave specialist teams . permission to access private spending records. Welfare reform minister . Lord Freud told MailOnline: ‘Our fraud investigators now have powers to check bank accounts, satellite TV bills, and credit reference records. 'Benefit cheats who try to steal from taxpayers need to . know our investigators are actively targeting them. ‘Our teams are actively going through . benefit claims to spotlight potential cheats and where fraud is . suspected we have the power to film suspects and raid people’s homes. These cheats can end up with criminal records and will have to pay back . their ill-gotten gains.’ The number of cases probed by the Fraud Investigation Service was 166,073 in 2011-12, up from 150,365 two years earlier. The majority of cases are passed to customer compliance teams, to allow the FIS to ‘focus on higher risk fraud’. The customer compliance team can cut benefits and recover overpayments, but the FIS takes serious cases to court. Some cases are so complex it can take months, and sometimes years, to result in a conviction. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has admitted fraud in the welfare system is 'rife' The DWP yesterday highlighted the latest person to be convicted of claiming benefits while working. Michelle Taylor, 40, of Bloxwich, . West Midlands, was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison, suspended for 12 . months, after claiming more than £21,000 in benefits because she said . she was unable to walk without support or a wheelchair. Walsall magistrates heard that she was filmed walking to the gym after an anonymous tip-off to investigators. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has admitted fraud and error is ‘rife’ in the current welfare system. He . told the Tory party conference the next stage of his reforms would be . the introduction of the Universal Credit - 'the most extensive shake up . of the welfare system for years, replacing many out-of-work payments . with a single, simple payment'. He added: 'It will save billions in fraud and error which is rife in the existing systems.' Earlier this month football manager John Alexander, 68, from Plymouth, admitted dishonestly failing to notify a . change of circumstances affecting his entitlement to benefit between . August 2010 and November 2011. He . claimed nearly . £7,000 in benefits because he was 'virtually unable to walk' but was . caught red-handed training his football team - jogging, kicking, . retrieving loose balls and gesticulating from the side of a pitch. The Department for Work and Pensions today highlighted cases it said proved new powers for investigators were working: . Steven Wiseman, . 45, of Primrose Road, Southampton, Hampshire, was sentenced last week . to 12 months in jail for a £67,241.27 benefit fraud after claiming . benefits while working as a van driver delivering sandwiches and rolls. David Durrant, . 64, of Colebrook, Crediton, Devon was sentenced on October 12 to 8 . months suspended for 2 years after being found guilty of working while . claiming £48,362.53 in benefits. Sara Peckham, . 42, of Maclean Road, Bournemouth, was sentenced to a 12 month Community . Order, 150 hours hours unpaid work requirement and told to pay . compensation of £5,000 earlier this month. She claimed disability . benefits because she could only walk short distances, but she was found . working cleaning cars and for a train company serving customers from a . trolley. Sakir Kaytaz-Mehmed, 56, . of Brantley Road, Birmingham was given six months to pay back . £51,892.49 following a confiscation hearing on last week.

"She's admitted that she feels the need to exercise every day as it affects her mood and has been showcasing a toned new physique lately so it made sense for Nike to snap up Ellie Goulding to front its latest fitness campaign. The British platinum-selling artist, who incorporates sport into her everyday life, is the star of the sporty brand's new Just Do It campaign because, they say, she encapsulates everything that it stands for. 'Ellie works hard, trains hard and plays hard to achieve the impossible, with an inspiring amount of inner drive and determination,' said a spokesperson for brand. Scroll down for video . Fitness fan: Ellie Goulding, who makes sure she incorporates sport into her everyday life, is the star of Nike's new Just Do It campaign . And it seems the brand aren't wrong about the 27-year-old singer, who is currently focussing on her training. She said: 'I’m always trying to increase my distance and speed. I’m doing the Paris 10k soon and aiming to beat my previous time. I have never done a marathon, so there’s also that. But I have also started sprinting recently. That’s my new thing. I am constantly on a journey - there is a lot further to go.' Despite often being hectic with shows, appearances and other work commitments, Ellie always finds the time to work out. 'It’s a prerequisite. It has to happen,' she said. 'All my crew and everyone around me knows that time has to be built into the day for me to exercise. It’s important that I know there is time in my schedule for exercise. 'I'll always do something. I woke up the other morning, feeling tired and unusually unmotivated, and I made myself a green tea, decided to snap out of it and put some music on and started dancing. My heart rate went up and I felt myself wanting to move - I did some sprints on the spot, some burpees, some lunges and things like that.' Always on the move: Speaking about fitting exercise into her daily life, Ellie said: 'It’s a prerequisite. It has to happen,' and explains that she can get herself into the mindset even when she is feeling tired and unmotivated . As well as running, she says she's really into boxing at the moment and trains with her security guard Gareth, who does a certain kind of JujitSu. While sport is working wonders on her energy levels and physique, it also helps her confidence. 'Exercise has taught me confidence and discipline in the long-term,' she said. 'Over the years I have managed to learn more about myself and my own motivation and how I push myself through sport, and have then managed to apply that to everything else.' Opening up about her work ethic and what inspires her to push herself that extra mile, she revealed that she has conversations with herself when she's about to start a race, a half marathon or a big show. Fashionable face: Ellie's most recent outing was at the Chloe show at Paris fashion week, where she joined her best friend Rosie Huntington-Whiteley . As well as her powerful voice and killer performances, Ellie's on-stage outfits often grab the headlines. So how important is it for her to feel and look good when working out? 'I don’t care that much,' she said. 'For boot camp I wear tiny shorts and a sports bra. The less I wear, the more aware I am of what my body looks like and what it’s actually doing when I move. If I can see what it’s doing - if it’s wobbling - then I can say to myself “Well you need to work on that, Ellie.” 'Having said that I don’t think I would draw attention to myself by going out running in the smallest clothes I have. In boot camp you can because you’re in the dark.' Ellie most recently showed off the fruits of her labour in a flattering outfit as she hit the Chloe show at Paris fashion week. Ellie arrived at the high-profile event with her pal Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.

"She rose to fame after winning reality TV show 'Signed by Katie Price' but Amy Willerton turned down a contract with the star's management to strike out on her own. Now she's battling it out to be crowned Miss Universe competing in Russia against models from around the world. The 21-year-old from Bristol has already impressed on the catwalk in an evening gown and bikini, while she wore a skimpy take on royal robes as she dressed up as a Queen for the 'national costume' round. Vying for the title: Amy Willerton representing Great Britain at the rehearsals of Miss Universe 2013 in Moscow . The winner, announced in a worldwide TV broadcast on Saturday, will gain a luxury lifestyle for a year funded by Donald Trump. Amy won her place in the competition after winning the title of Miss London in 2012 and then Miss Universe Great Britain in 2013. Her beauty pageant success came after she controversially turned down a contract with Katie's company, BlackSheep Management. Two years ago, she beat 10,000 other young models to be crowned the winner of Sky Living's show Signed by Katie Price. On the worldwide stage: The model, who won the reality TV Signed by Katie Price, takes a break during Miss Universe rehearsals. The winner will be announced in a live broadcast on Saturday . On entering the competition, she was promised a ­modelling contract with mentoring from Katie, her picture on the front cover of OK! magazine, a Range Rover and a holiday in the Maldives. But she told The Sunday Mirror she never received any of these things and felt 'let down' after giving up a place studying media at Cardiff University to take part in the show. She said at the time: 'I never expected overnight fame. But I don't believe the promises from Katie or her team were kept. 'I gave up my job, was encouraged to turn down a place at university and had to put my life on hold.' In the running: Amy has already taken to the catwalk in the ball gown and bikini rounds . Queen of the catwalk: In the national costume round she donned a skimpy regal outfit . She said she had always admired Katie . and identified with her as she has a brother who is disabled like the . glamour model's son Harvey. But far from being mentored by her, Amy said Katie had no time for her and she felt she didn't even like her. Amy said the management company failed to find any work for her so she had to survive on her savings and support from her parents. She added: 'I'm so angry. When I won, I thought life . would change. It has... but for the worse. My life's been turned upside . down. I've had enough of Katie and don't want anything more to do with . her or her team.' Katie was said to react with fury when Amy refused to sign a contract after winning the show calling her 'arrogant, stuck-up and fake.' Meanwhile BlackSheep . Management issued a statement saying they were 'disappointed' in Amy . saying she 'had changed from the girl we met during filming.' They . said it was unreasonable for her to expect overnight success as it . would take 'time and money' to raise her profile. They said they had not . failed to deliver the Range Rover (but that Amy couldn't drive it . because she couldn't afford the £10,000 insurance) and had offered her a . holiday in the Marbella instead of the Maldives. Fall out: Amy said she felt let down after Katie Price failed to mentor her as promised when she won her search for a star . Amy's website states that she walked away from Katie and her team because 'she wanted to take her career in a different direction.' She added in another interview with The Mirror that she hasn't had contact with Katie since. She said: 'I broke off all contact when I decided to leave. A lot of very upsetting things happened - some of which Kate doesn't even know about - but I think we are both best moving on and going our separate ways. 'There was only room for one leading lady in that circus. I want to be the leading lady of my own game.' And Katie isn't the only person Amy has broken ties with ahead of her Miss Universe appearance. The Daily Mail's Richard Kay reported last month how she had been dumped by her multi-millionaire diamond dealer boyfriend, Mohamed Shawesh. The model said she was upset by the break-up but focussing on the Miss Universe competition was helping her move on. She said: 'We were madly in love - but then he dumped me on holiday. I was quite shocked at first, but I think that it was a classic case of me not being able to give him enough attention. 'I need to focus on my career because I'm very ambitious and it's much more difficult with a man around.' While she isn't being mentored by Katie, it seems Amy's career may yet follow a similar path to the glamour model's. She's tipped . to be taking part in the new series of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of . Here, the show that propelled Katie's career.","Amy beat thousands to win  TV show 'Signed by Katie Price'

"Nick Clegg is drawing up plans for a £7billion raid on middle class pensions to help head off cuts to public spending. The Liberal Democrat leader has ordered a wide-ranging review that could result in the end of the 40p tax break on retirement savings enjoyed by higher rate taxpayers. The move would be a massive blow to millions of middle income families trying to save for retirement. Scroll down for video . Nick Clegg (left) is drawing up plans for a £7billion raid on middle class pensions to help head off cuts to public spending. Business Secretary Vince Cable (right) yesterday accused the Tories of ‘lying’ for suggesting that Britain’s huge budget deficit can be paid off without the need for tax rises . However, the party says it will enable it to reduce the need for spending cuts after the next election – and Business Secretary Vince Cable yesterday accused the Tories of ‘lying’ for suggesting that Britain’s huge budget deficit can be paid off without the need for tax rises. The new review goes much further than plans announced by the Lib Dems at the weekend to raise £1billion for the NHS by reducing the lifetime allowance for pension tax relief from £1.25million to £1million. Under the existing system, higher rate taxpayers get 40p tax relief for every 60p they save towards their pension. By contrast, basic rate taxpayers get just 20p for every 80p they save. Under the new proposals, tax relief could be ‘equalised’ for all taxpayers at 25 or 30p in the pound. Pensions minister Steve Webb, who is carrying out the review, said the current policy ‘cannot be right’. He said only part of the savings would be siphoned off to help pay down the deficit, with the rest recycled into more generous tax reliefs for basic rate payers. Mr Webb said: ‘Some people would take a hit, but on the whole they are people who will still end up with very decent pensions. There would be more gainers overall. ‘We could probably spend less on pension tax relief overall – helping to contribute to deficit reduction – but also rebalance the money so that everyone, rich or poor, got help at the same rate.’ Mr Clegg added the current system meant that the better off were ‘disproportionately’ rewarded, but said the party was not ‘committed’ to the proposal yet. A recent report by the Centre for Policy Studies think-tank suggested that scrapping higher rate relief could save the taxpayer £7billion a year, although Mr Webb suggested the savings would be more modest. But former Treasury pensions adviser Ros Altmann warned it could have consequences for savers. Mr Cable launched a stinging attack on the Tories for pledging to pay off the deficit through public spending and welfare cuts alone. He called Tory plans for £25billion more cuts ‘deeply irresponsible’ and accused the party of ‘reinventing themselves as Ukip without the beer’. Michael Howard was blocked from becoming Britain’s new EU Commissioner by Nick Clegg, senior Lib Dems claimed last night. The former Tory leader is believed to have been vetoed because Mr Clegg said his MPs ‘couldn’t stomach’ certain figures. Lib Dem MEP Chris Davies said he had been told by sources ‘very close to Nick’ that he had blocked at least one Tory nominee. He told BBC Radio 4’s PM programme that one of the Lib Dems’ greatest achievements in the Coalition had been stopping the Tories from ‘doing unpleasant things’. Another Lib Dem source confirmed Lord Howard’s name, saying that Mr Clegg had left the Tories ‘under no illusions that his nomination wouldn’t be acceptable’. Calling for billions of pounds more spending on Britain’s creaking infrastructure, he added: ‘The truth is more taxes will be needed. To contribute to deficit reduction and also to address unacceptable inequalities. Any politician who tells you that the next Government can balance the budget and avoid tax increases is lying to you.’ Mr Cable also drew a line over immigration, saying more migrants were needed to help fuel the economic recovery. He said: ‘Our responsibility as Liberal Democrats is to tell the uncomfortable truth: that the vast majority of migrants coming to the UK from inside or outside the EU have brought tangible benefits to the economy.’","Nick Clegg is drawing up plans for a £7billion raid on middle class pensions .

"When scouring through far-flung corners of the world, you never know what you might find. This month, an Australian film crew, led by cinematographer Abrahem Joffe, stumbled upon the world’s largest lip disc in the remote valleys of southern Ethiopia. Joffe told Daily Mail Australia the crew was filming a documentary series for Canon Australia when they made the discovery. ‘We were taking a tour with some of the local guides. When they spotted the woman, they were absolutely bewildered,' he said. ‘I’m a big reader of Guinness World Records and I figured it was out of the ordinary, but you know you've found something special when the locals are amazed.’ Ataye Eligidagne, 20, dons the largest lip disc in the world. The hardened clay disc is 59.5 cm in circumference and 19.5 cm in diameter . The discs are a tradition dating back further than 1896, and a way of attracting a husband amongst the the Surma woman of the lower Omo Rover valley in Ethiopia . The procedure of preparing to wear the discs, which also involves knocking out the bottom two teeth, is done at the age of 15-18 . Ataye Eligidagne, 20, dons the largest lip disk in the world. At a whopping 59.5 cm in circumference and 19.5 cm in diameter, it’s over twice the size of the average disc. The previous record disc in the Guinness Book of World Records was 15cm in diameter. Lip discs are a long-running tradition amongst the Surma woman of the lower Omo Rover valley in Ethiopia. There is evidence of woman wearing the discs in this region from 1896. The procedure, which also involves knocking out the bottom two teeth, is done at the age of 15-18. In recent times, the Ethiopian government has taken measures to ban the discs, and the frequency amongst the younger generations is reportedly dwindling. The discs carry a multifaceted significance. They are intended to attract a husband, as well as a dowry for the family of the wife, who are given a contingent  of cattle respective to the size of the disc. But they are also a form of self-expression. ‘I think that locally, it's a matter of pride. The larger the disc, the more impressive. Young people try to outdo each other all over the world.' Eligidagne, who has been stretching her lips for three years since the initial piercing, said it was not painful at all and there weren't any adverse affects from wearing the disc . In recent times, the Ethiopian government has taken measures to ban the discs, and the frequency amongst the younger generations is reportedly dwindling . The previous example of the largest disk in the Guinness Book of Records was 15cm in diameter, making Eligidagne by far the largest of it's kind in the world . Joffe asked for their guides to translate for the woman so he could interview her, but the guides were not fluent in Mursi, the local dialect, so they had to use a local warrior to translate for the guide .

When asked if her daughter would adhere to the tradition, Eligidagne said she would respect her daughters decision . Eligidagne has been stretching her lips for three years since the initial piercing. The process also involved the removal of bottom two front teeth. Joffe asked for their guides to translate for the woman so he could interview her, but the guides were not fluent in Mursi, the local dialect, so they had to use a local warrior to translate for the guide. ‘During the interview, we offered her some Coca-Cola. It was a fascinating, because she had clearly never tasted anything like it,' he said. ‘Ataye poured it onto her tongue with the disc in place, and suddenly had this stunned expression. It was incredible.’ Joffe asked if there were any hurdles that come with such an unusual tradition. ‘She said it was not painful at all and there weren't any adverse affects.' But Eligidagne acknowledged that the discs may not be around forever. ‘When we asked her if her daughter would adhere to the tradition, she said wasn’t sure her daughter will see it the same way, and she would respect her daughters decision on whether or not to do it.’","This month, an Australian film crew led by cinematographer Abrahem Joffe was filming in southern Ethiopia .

"He is one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time, but it seems the remarkable career of Tom Brady may be coming to a crashing halt. Only four games into the season, the New England Patriots star and owner of three Super Bowl rings has been putting up abysmal numbers, resulting in two losses for his team, an early season rarity for the storied dynasty. Even worse, the Patriots second-string quarterback, Jimmy Garoppolo, replaced Brady in last night's game against the Kansas City Chiefs, and looked like the far more experienced and capable player of the two. Scroll down for video . Sad Brady: Tom Brady (above) has been putting up abysmal numbers this season . Stats: In the first four game, the quartback great has thrown for only four touchdowns and 791 yards . All this has many wondering if Brady, and the Patriots', reign as the best in the NFL is coming to an end. Since their shocking Super Bowl win in 2001, Brady and the Patriots have posted numbers unlike any team in the history of football, with five Super Bowl appearances in just 11 seasons and three Super Bowl wins, as well as becoming the only team since the league expanded the regular season to 16 games in 1978 to go undefeated back in 2007. The force behind all of this has been Brady, who, at 37, is one of only two players, alongside Joe Montana, in NFL history to win the NFL Most Valuable Player and Super Bowl MVP awards multiple times. He also holds the record for postseason passing yards, places third on the list for postseason touchdowns, and has won an astonishing 148 regular season games and 18 postseason games, numbers that are even more impressive considering he was one of the last players picked in the 2000 draft. Dynasty: Brady has led the New England Patriots to three Super Bowl wins, in 2001, 2003 (right) and 2004 (left) Dynamic duo: Brady and Patriots coach Bill Belichick (above) are one of the greatest tandems in the history of football . Coming up: Patriots second-string quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo (above) has been showing plenty of promise . This season however is a far different story, with the man who was long believed by many to be untouchable posting numbers that are no doubt causing major concern for his boss, and biggest champion, Patriots coach Bill Belichick. He is completing just 59 percent of his passes and has only 791 yards, and four touchdowns, in the first four games of the season. Last night against the Chiefs he had only 159 yards before he was pulled from the game by Belichick, this after his second interception. And the Chiefs did not just beat the Patriots, they routed the team, going up 41 - 7 at one point, the most Brady has ever been down in a game. No doubt making matters much, much worse for Brady was the performance of Garoppolo last night, whose story as the good looking backup who comes in to save the day and plays remarkably cool under pressure is eerily similar to the one that played out between Brady and former Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe back in 2001. Personal life: Brady's wife Gisele Bundchen (above) is one of the biggest models in the world . Family: Gisele opened the Chanel show in Paris earlier today (above left) and the couple have two children, Benjamin and Vivian (right) That being said, this is still the Patriots,the one team that should never be counted out. They started the 2001 season at 0-2 before going on to win the Super Bowl, and Belichick and Brady still remain perhaps the greatest tandem in the history of the sport, or any sport for that matter. Of course, if things don't get better for Brady, there's no need to feel too concerned for the man. He signed a five-year, $57 million contract in 2013 meaning he will likely play through the 2017 season. Furthermore, his wife, and mother to his two children, Benjamin and Vivian, is 34-year-old Gisele Bundchen, one of the most successful models of all time who is still without question at the top of her game, having just opened the Chanel show in Paris earlier today. And there is no question that no matter what happens this season or next season or the season after that, Brady will go down as one of the greatest to play the game .","Many believe Tom Brady's reign as one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL may be coming to an end following his poor performance so far this season .

Beyonce (left) and Topshop owner Sir Philip Green (right) will team up to create Parkwood TopShop Athetic Ltd . Sir Philip Green comments: 'We have been looking at this category as fashion inspired fitness develops, and know that this is right in our customers' heartland. 'Creating a partnership with Beyoncé, one of the most hard-working and talented people in the world, who spends many hours of her life dancing, rehearsing and training is a unique opportunity to develop this category.' 'I could not think of a better partner as I continue to grow the Parkwood business. I have always loved TopShop for their fashion credentials and forward thinking' said Beyoncé. 'Working with their development team to create and produce a technical and fashion led collection is exciting and I'm looking forward to participating in all aspects of this partnership.' Beyonce is undoubtedly a style icon for her generation and her legions of fans will be desperate to get their hands on her latest fashion venture when it launches next Autumn . Beyonce teamed up with H&M in 2013 as the face of their Summer campaign . Together with her mother Tina, Beyonce launched her own fashion brand House of Dereon in 2005 . Named after Beyonce's maternal grandmother Agnèz Deréon the brand includes denim collections as well as sportswear, footwear and high glamour clothes .

It's something we need to be in. 'Based on what she does, how she works out, the conversation got into that category. We started getting into proper conversation in May or June, as to how it would work. It took six or eight weeks to put a deal together. 'On Friday, Beyoncé came to our office for the last piece of the jigsaw puzzle.'

"Police forces across the country will investigate officers for dealing with criminals to buy steroids and abusing their power for sex, a chief constable said today. Mike Cunningham said the top risk factors for corruption of police officers are inappropriate relationships -  including to buy bodybuilding drugs, abuse of power for sexual gratification and misuse of information systems. He said most forces across the country will be running investigations into officers who associate with criminals to get steroids, or use their position to sleep with people. Police forces across the country will investigate officers for dealing with criminals to buy steroids and abusing their power for sex, a chief constable said today (stock image) The Chief Constable of Staffordshire was speaking as the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) published a report on how to tackle corruption. He said: 'We do our own assessment of corruption threats, one of them is steroid abuse and gym use by officers. 'What that starts off is very often officers going to the gyms, beginning to dabble in steroids, then the relationships they form when they’re using steroids become corrupt and corrosive. 'There is good evidence of officers getting way out of their depth with serious criminals who they are beholden to.' He said that dozens of officers across the country are caught up in this kind of situation. Mike Cunningham, Chief Constable of Staffordshire, said in most forces there would be an officer who would abuse steroids . 'We do know that most forces would be investigating an issue which relates to an officer with steroid abuse,' he said. 'In most forces there will be a police officer who is into bodybuilding and the gym and who would abuse steroids. 'There would be an investigation in most professional standards departments in the country in relation to an allegation of steroid abuse.' Abuse of power for sex is also occurring across forces in England and Wales. Mr Cunningham said: 'We found that when we asked force professional standards departments that again most forces were investigating allegations against individual officers abusing their position for sexual favour.' Chief constables will discuss plans later this week on how to tackle allegations of corruption. Plans under discussion include making details of gross misconduct hearings public, and revealing the details of chief constables’ pay packets and the extra perks they might receive. Officers could also be made to wait for a cooling-off period before leaving the service and taking a job at a private company. Ethics committees could also be set up to monitor each force, independently of the police and crime commissioner.","Mike Cunningham, Chief Constable of Staffordshire, said in 'most forces there would be an officer who would abuse steroids'

"It is such stuff as a football fan's dreams are made on – being pulled from the crowd to replace an injured player and scoring a crucial last-minute goal. For 20-year-old Sarah Crilly, the dream came true when she was asked to pull on the Scotland jersey as she sat in the stands watching the national women's team play. Miss Crilly was a spectator at the game against Norway in which Scotland, having already been hit by two late call-offs, suffered a series of injuries. When yet another player was carried off, with only ten minutes to go, Miss Crilly was  summoned to the dressing room. Great Scot! In boots two sizes too big Sarah Crilly, wearing number 14, bears down on goal before equalising for Scotland against Norway . She took to the pitch in borrowed boots two sizes too big – and three pairs of socks to ensure they stayed on – yet kept her nerve to score the equaliser as Scotland trailed 2-1. Miss Crilly, of Carluke, Lanarkshire, said: 'I was there for a day out with my friends and the next thing I know I'm stepping on the park. It was crazy. I couldn't believe it when I scored. It was incredible.' She has been playing football since she was three and has been with Hamilton Ladies since she was 11. She has played for the  Scotland under-17 and under-19 teams and had been helping out the full squad in training. Incredible: Sarah Crilly, pictured right, celebrates with teammate Jane Ross after scoring the late equaliser in the Vauxhall Internationa Challenge match last week . Miss Crilly was then invited to the . friendly at Dunfermline's East End Park last Thursday ahead of two . crucial Euro 2013 qualifiers against Wales and France later this month. She said: 'I was standing with my friends waiting on a cup of tea when the team administrator came up and asked if I had my boots with me. I didn't. So she took me to the changing room and got me kitted out. 'The shorts were way too big and baggy and I was wearing three pairs of socks. I must have looked ridiculous.' Miss Crilly, who studies sport at Stirling University, would not  normally have been allowed to play – but the referee agreed to relax the rules as it was a friendly. Big impact: After make her dramatic last gasp entry to the field of play Sarah Crilly has everything to smile about . Scotland boss Anna Signeul said: 'Sarah . was training with the players during the week but she wasn't in the . squad – so we asked if she could play because we were a player short. I'm very pleased with her – the first ever game with the  A-squad and . she scores.' Hamilton Ladies manager Kevin Murphy said: 'I wasn't aware Sarah was even at the game.

"David Cameron should apologise for failing to cut immigration, Nick Clegg suggested tonight in an escalation of the coalition row over control of Britain's borders. Mr Clegg hit back at his critics who accuse him of breaking promises to stay in power, pointing to the Tories' missed target to reduce net migration to the 'tens of thousands'. But the Lib Dems have used their party conference in Glasgow to call for more open immigration, insisting migrants from both inside and outside the EU have brought 'tangible benefits' to the UK. Nick Clegg (right), pictured at his party conference in Glasgow today, called for David Cameron to apologise for not meeting Tory promises on immigration . Mr Cameron promised a Conservative government would cut net migration to the tens of thousands. But since the coalition was formed the numbers arriving each year have topped more than 200,000, fuelled mostly by large numbers arriving from elsewhere in the EU. In an interview with the BBC, Mr Clegg rejected criticism of Lib Dem broken promises and suggested the Tories should say sorry to voters. 'I've never heard an apology from David Cameron for promising he's going to get net migration down when he's failed to do so,' he said. Mr Clegg famously issued a public apology for breaking the Lib Dem pledge to abolish tuition fees, which was later remixed into a music video which entered the top 40. Net migration from EU countries has risen sharply in recent years, hitting 131,000 in the 12 months to March 2014, according to data from the Office for National Statistics . Nick Clegg has challenged David Cameron to 'come clean' on whether he will take part in televised leadership debates in the run-up to next year's general election. The Liberal Democrat leader accused Conservatives of 'foot-dragging' over the debates and said it was time for the Prime Minister to end uncertainty over his plans. Mr Clegg is committed to a re-run of the TV clashes tried for the first time in 2010. He suggested Mr Cameron was 'running scared' of taking on his rivals in front of the cameras. 'This foot-dragging by the Conservatives is getting rather boring now. 'Let's just get on with it,' said Mr Clegg. 'We had the TV debates last time, people enjoyed them, they livened up the whole thing, they're actually quite good fun. 'The Tories should come clean - if they want to run scared they should come clean and say they don't want to do them, but not this endless ducking and weaving.' The Lib Dem leader added: 'I've said sorry to those people who are disappointed about some of the decisions we couldn't make. I'm not Prime Minister, I can't deliver the Liberal Democrat manifesto in full. 'I've never heard an apology from Ed Miliband for crashing the economy,' he said. However his claims that Mr Cameron should apologise for failing to tackle immigration is likely to spark a furious response from the Conservatives who blame the Lib Dems for blocking efforts to control the numbers of people who come to Britain. A Tory source hit back at Mr Clegg, telling MailOnline: 'I don't think the man who can't keep a promise for more than two minutes is in a position to lecture others.' Mr Cameron last week used his Tory party conference speech to make clear he would put immigration 'at the very heart' of his renegotiation strategy for Europe, which he has promised before staging an in-out referendum by 2017. 'So we're going to go in as a country, get our powers back, fight for our national interest and yes – we'll put it to a referendum in or out – it will be your choice,' he said. However, the Lib Dems have never signed up to the 'tens of thiousands' target as a coalition policy, and oppose the idea of limiting free movement across Europe. Today Lib Dem president Tim Farron told conference delegates how Britain’s future 'relies not on turning away the best and the brightest from our shores...relies not on attacking migrants'. He added: 'Migrants who make a net contribution to our economy. Migrants who are less likely to claim benefits than our own citizens. 'Instead we should be grateful and proud that migrants have chosen to relocate their lives here and are working to build our economy. 'These people make Britain great, we should celebrate them not demonise them.' While the number of people leaving the UK has remained at around 80,000, the numbers arriving from the EU have risen sharply . Business Secretary Vince Cable yesterday said the Tories were trying to 'close the borders to skills and talents that Britain needs, by pursuing an absurd net migration target – plucked out of the air and totally unenforceable'. Mr Cable argued for more open immigration, accepting people coming to Britain to study or work. 'Overseas students, whose fees subsidise British students and earn £9bn a year for the UK, are discouraged and so go to the US or Australia instead. 'Firms who need specialist skills from Japan, India or the US have to climb piles of red tape (far bigger than anything generated by Eurocrats in Brussels). 'We then train Chinese engineers and insist they go home just when British industry can make good use of them. 'But, of course, there is always a warm welcome isn't there for dodgy billionaires willing to make a large party donation for a game of tennis with Boris and Dave.' Mr Cable said the Lib Dems have a responsibility 'to tell the uncomfortable truth that the vast majority of migrants coming to the UK from inside or outside the EU have brought tangible benefits to the economy, importing valuable skills and strengthening our civic culture'. He added: 'Of course immigration does have to be controlled at the point of entry and exit. And we must deal with abuse and crack down on 'benefit tourism'. 'But not at the expense of the EU Single Market, and its free movement of workers.'","Clegg hits back at critics who accuse him of breaking Lib Dem promises .

"Half of a power station which supplies electricity to a million homes will remain out of action indefinitely following a major blaze – prompting blackout fears. The devastating blaze at the Didcot B site in Oxfordshire comes days before National Grid sets out its winter outlook, amid worries over how it will keep the lights on if there is an 'energy crunch'. It is expected to put further pressure on the UK's squeezed electricity network and could result in supply failing to keep up with demand. Scroll down for video . Firefighters are investigating the cause of a major blaze at Didcot B power station in Oxfordshire . The fire broke out about 8pm last night. There are no reports of any injuries, according to officials . Energy Secretary Ed Davey said National Grid had assured him that there was no risk to energy supplies . But a spokesman for the Grid said details of the potential impact on capacity over the winter would not be set out until it publishes its seasonal outlook on October 28 . At least 25 fire engines and around 100 firefighters raced battle the flames which ripped through four cooling towers, leaving the plant operating at 50 per cent capacity. Fire officers are currently investigating the cause of the blaze, but they have ruled out arson and terrorism. This is the latest blaze to hit Britain's power capacity, with Ironbridge and Ferrybridge crippled by fires earlier this year. Energy supply has also been hit by plans to close a site at Barking in east London. At least 25 fire engines and around 100 firefighters battled the flames which ripped through a cooling tower . A spokeswoman at Oxfordshire Fire Service confirmed investigating officers will visit the scene this morning, and said they are likely to remain there throughout the day . It also emerged that four EDF nuclear power reactors, which shut down after a defect was discovered, will be operating at three-quarters capacity by the end of this year. Officials at the RWE npower owned site - who carry out regular safety drills - managed to shut down the Didcot site quickly to stop the incident turning into an inferno. A spokesman for RWE said: 'The affected part of the site will remain non-operational until an investigation and repairs can take place. It is too early to give any definitive estimate of how long this will be.' Npower said the plant was only producing half as much power as it normally would for the National Grid, but that all 70 of its staff who work there were at the station today. Dorian Lucas, energy analyst at Inenco, said the long term impact of the fire on the UK's power supply could be 'significant' if the damage takes some time to repair . The B Station opened in July 1997. The A Station, a combined coal and oil plant, shut last year . The company said it will begin its own assessment of the damage once the fire service has left. An Npower spokesman said: 'One bank of cooling towers has been unaffected which means the station can still operate but it could take a week or two before the plant is fully operational. 'The assessment of the damage and repair costs won't start until the fire service has left.' There were no reports of casualties, but Thames Valley Police were advising local residents to keep windows and doors closed because of clouds of billowing smoke. Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: 'First, I want to thank the emergency services who are at Didcot working to tackle the blaze. A total of four cooling towers were affected by the blaze and two of those were completely destroyed . Thames Valley Police are were advising local residents to keep windows and doors closed because of clouds of billowing smoke . The Didcot incident is the latest blaze to hit Britain's power capacity, with Ironbridge and Ferrybridge crippled by fires earlier this year . Responce: Dozens of firemen from across Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire were fighting the fire . Officials at the RWE npower owned site  managed to shut down the site quickly to stop the incident turning into an inferno . 'I've been reassured by National Grid that there is no risk to electricity supplies. 'I will be keeping in touch with the relevant authorities throughout. My priority is to understand the cause of the fire and get the affected unit back generating electricity as soon as it's safe to do so.' But a spokesman for the National Grid said details of the potential impact on capacity over the winter would not be set out until it publishes its seasonal outlook on October 28. The latest outage appears to bring closer a 'last resort' scenario described by Mr Davey earlier this year to keep the lights on. This would see factories paid to shut down in peak times and mothballed power stations being fired up to supply reserve power. Npower has said the damaged part of Didcot B will remain non-operational until an insepection and repairs can take place . Rising: There were no reports of casualties but Thames Valley Police were advising local residents to keep windows and doors closed because of clouds of billowing smoke . The UK is facing an energy crunch over the next two winters when the capacity margin - how much its total generating capacity outstrips expected peak demand - is expected to shrink to as little as 2 per cent. A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: 'The lights will not go out this winter. 'Up and down the country there are power stations on standby that can start pumping out power when needed, and the Government has given National Grid the extra powers it needs to ensure there is enough electricity to keep the lights. 'There have been some unexpected closures over the past few months and National Grid is buying some extra energy supply to make up for any shortfall. 'The Government will continue to work with National Grid and energy providers to make sure the system remains secure over the coming months.' Fire crews spray water on to the B Station, which generates electricity using natural gas . A spokesman for RWE npower said: 'We can confirm that no one is injured which is clearly the most important thing and also that the fire is now under control' Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: 'First, I want to thank the emergency services who are at Didcot working to tackle the blaze' It is not clear how the Didcot fire started, but officials have ruled out arson or terrorism. Oxfordshire's assistant chief fire officer, Simon Furlong, said the blaze began in one of Didcot B power station's cooling towers and spread to three other towers. Mr Furlong said: 'We responded to the scene and worked well to extinguish the fire. 'We work closely in partnership with the power station to ensure we have plans in place should an incident of this nature actually happen. 'The fire itself was extinguished quickly - there are no reports of injuries, which of course is pleasing. 'We have three fire engines on-scene still, dampening down hot spots and we will continue to have a presence there for at least the next 24 hours. 'An investigation has begun in conjunction with other agencies regarding the cause of the fire. 'I expect that it will take some time to determine the reasons behind what actually happened.' Power station has dominated Oxfordshire skyline since building work started on the A Station in the 1960s . Around 12 fire crews attended the power station at around 9pm, but that number doubled as flames took hold . It is not clear how the fire started, but fire service officials have ruled out arson or terrorism . The charred remains of the cooling towers are seen at the plant, which is around 70 miles west of London . Resident Steve Shadbolt said: 'I looked across at the power station and there was this bright light. I got my camera and zoomed in and realised one of the towers was alight' Local resident Daniel Anderton tweeted: 'It was well alight. Lots of fire brigade, police and helicopters...' Fellow Didcot local Amy Lambourne said: 'It still looked very bad even after an hour.' Steve Shadbolt told the Oxford Mail newspaper: 'I live on Great Western Park and I looked across at the power station and there was this bright light. 'I got my camera and zoomed in and realised one of the towers was alight. 'It burnt so fiercely that it spread to the next one.' The power station has dominated the Oxfordshire skyline since construction work started on the A Station in the 1960s. The B Station opened in July 1997. The A Station, a combined coal and oil plant, shut last year. Its three giant cooling towers were demolished in July. Hundreds watched as the blast, using more than 400lb of explosives, flattened 36,000 tons of material in seconds.

"For many, self-destructing Snapchat messages and wiping their phone when it’s stolen is the closest they’ll come to needing to destroy data on a device. But, for people who work with highly sensitive documents and official secrets - or are extremely paranoid about protecting their personal data - there is now a range of self-destructing hard drives. Reminiscent of the gadgets in Mission Impossible, the drives can be wiped instantly simply by sending a text message - but they come with a spy price tag of £1,000 ($1,600). The Autothysis128s and Autothysis128t (pictured centre and right) are 2.5-inch solid state drives, that are controlled using a free smartphone app. When a user loses the drive, they send a text to the device and the storage is destroyed automatically. An authentication token (left) adds an extra level of security . There are three self-destructing drives available from London-based Secure Drives, as well as a Master Kill Switch. Prices start at £938 ($1,500), for the Autothysis DSP, while the Autothysis128s costs £967 ($1,560) and the top-of-the-range Autothysis128t costs £1,027 ($1,663). The Autothysis128s and Autothysis128t are 2.5-inch solid state drives (SSD), that can be controlled using a free smartphone app available on Android and iOS. The drives each have 128GB of encrypted storage and can be fitted to computers, or connected externally using a USB port. They also have built-in GSM, or cellular technology, which means they can receive text messages. When a user loses the drive, or wants to permanently delete the data on it, they  send a text to the device and the storage is destroyed. In addition to a text message, the data can be destroyed by turning off the GSM signal, entering a PIN too many times incorrectly, removing the drive from a PC, when the battery falls below a certain level, or using an optional authentication token. The Authothysis DSP has the same amount of storage and encryption tools as the other two drives, but doesn’t come with GSM functions.

The Autothysis128s a 2.5-inch solid state drive (SSD), that can be controlled using a free smartphone app available on Android and iOS. More than one smartphone can be linked to a drive, and if the phone is lost or stolen, the connection can be broken using a PIN code. The drive has 128GB of encrypted storage and can be fitted to computers, or connected externally using a USB port. It also has built-in GSM, or cellular technology, which means it can receive text messages. When a user loses the drive, or wants to permanently delete the data on it, they  send a text to the device and the storage is destroyed automatically. The technology is designed to fragment, or scramble, the data, making it impossible to extract or read, plus a built-in security measure stops any attempts made to recover the data. In addition to a text message, the data can be destroyed by turning off the GSM signal, entering a PIN too many times incorrectly, removing the drive from a PC, when the battery falls below a certain level, or using an optional authentication token. This £111 ($180) token adds an extra level of security and means only the owner can destroy the data. After the first year, customers  also have to pay an extra £29 ($47) for a yearly GSM subscription. The Autothysis128t has almost all of the same features as the Autothysis128s, but has added internal security measures  to make the drive even more impenetrable. The technology is reminiscent of the gadgets used by Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible (pictured in the 2011 Ghost Protocol film). As a result, the Secure Drives also come with a spy price tag.

"Taking his own advice not to linger at the beach, President Barack Obama cut short his family's vacation on Martha's Vineyard and headed back to Washington late on Friday to await the landfall of a Hurricane Irene, which he warned could be an 'historic' storm. Joined by his wife, Michelle, and daughters Malia and Sasha, Mr Obama boarded his Marine One helicopter at the island's airport and took off for Cape Cod, where Air Force One then took them back to Washington. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the president felt it prudent to be back in Washington when Irene strikes the Eastern Seaboard. Holiday halt: U.S. President Barack Obama and his family walk to board Air Force One at Cape Cod late on Friday after cutting short by a day their vacation on Martha's Vineyard . Mr Obama informed his staff shortly after urging millions of Americans in the path of the storm to heed instructions from state and local officials, especially if directed to evacuate. 'Don't wait, don't delay,' Mr Obama said. The storm was on course to rake the coastline from North Carolina to New England over the weekend. The President, speaking from his vacation rental on the island, said the federal government is 'bringing all federal resources to bear' in response. 'I cannot stress this highly enough, if you are in the projected path of this hurricane you have to take precautions now,' he said. Illustrating government preparations, Mr Earnest said that the administration conducted a national exercise to test emergency preparedness in 2009. He said the exercise included a simulated hurricane that struck New York City. He said the President participated in that exercise. Though Martha's Vineyard was in Irene's path, Mr Earnest said Mr Obama's decision to return to Washington on Friday night, instead of Saturday as planned, was not made out of worry about his personal safety. Mr Obama has been vacationing in Martha's Vineyard since August 18, though the holiday's been repeatedly interrupted amid the upheaval in Libya, Tuesday's East Coast earthquake and preparations for the new jobs and debt package Mr Obama is unveiling next month. None too pleased: Mr Obama walks with his wife Michelle and daughters Malia (left) and Sasha as they board Air Force One late on Friday . Back home: The Obama family disembark Air Force One in Washington, where the President will await Hurricane Irene's landfall . Mr Obama said he had been briefed on Irene's status on Friday morning by top federal officials. He also talked to governors of states and mayors of communities in the expected hurricane path, including mayors Michael Bloomberg of New York and Michael Nutter of Philadelphia. As the president spoke, rains from Irene's outer bands began hitting the Carolinas, along with six to nine-foot waves. On Martha's Vineyard, though, Mr Obama stood in the shade of a poplar tree outside a gray-shingled cottage. Otherwise it was bright sunshine, not a cloud in the sky. Back to work: The President waves as he walks with his family across the South Lawn of the White House late on Friday . 'Historic': Earlier in the day, Mr Obama declared that Hurricane Irene would be an 'historic' storm during a speech at his vacation home on Blue Heron Farm on Martha's Vineyard . Mr Obama cautioned that it would take time after the storm to begin rescue operations and get resources to people in need. 'So the more you can do to be prepared now, making a plan, make a supply kit , know your evacuation route, follow instructions of your local officials, the quicker we can focus our resources after the storm on those who need help the most,' he said. 'All indications point to this being a historic hurricane.' Two years ago, Obama's first vacation on Martha's Vineyard as president was delayed by Hurricane Bill.","President took part in emergency test in 2009, which simulated a hurricane striking New York City ."
"Walking up the aisle in their wedding finery, they look like any other nervous couple about to tie the knot. But this blushing bride has a secret camera hidden in her bouquet – and is about to expose the marriage as a sham. Playing her part in a TV sting operation, undercover journalist Harriet Morter helped to reveal how easy it is for immigrants to marry Europeans for UK visas. Scroll down for video . Sham: Undercover reporter Harriet Morter (right) took part in a TV sting, which involved attempting to set up a sham wedding with her 'fiance' Ali (left), in a bid to show how easy it is for immigrants to marry for passports . Disguise: Despite Ali believing he was marrying to get a passport, the blushing bride had a secret camera hidden in her bouquet to record the dramatic events . She met her Indian ‘fiance’, called Ali, through a self-styled sham marriage fixer who advertised her services on the classifieds website Gumtree. Ali agreed to pay £5,000 to marry his British bride, while the fixer – known only as Elizabeth – was to take a further £400. Ali even offered Miss Morter an extra £10,000 if she would have a baby with him. To make their relationship seem more authentic, he hired a Rolls-Royce to drive her to the register office and even took her shopping for a wedding dress. The most difficult moment came before the big day, when the couple were interviewed by a registrar who wanted to make sure their love was real. Amazingly, Ali forgot his bride’s address and couldn’t even name the borough where she lived – but they were still allowed to set a wedding date. The filmmakers said the registrar, who was not named, did report his suspicions to the Home Office but the case simply ‘slipped through the net’. The sham ceremony was only called off at the last moment, when the registrar asked if anyone present knew of any lawful impediment to the marriage. At that point, journalist Paul Connolly – who was posing as Miss Morter’s best man with his own hidden camera in his button – stepped up and revealed they had filmed the entire process. The pair met through a 'fixer' who advertised her services on Gumtree and Ali agreed to pay £5,000 to marry his British bride . In dramatic footage that will be shown on Channel 5 tomorrow, Ali is last seen fleeing from the register office. Before the ceremony, he had boasted to the undercover team that he would use the marriage to get a British passport. He explained he had been living on a student visa, despite the fact he never attended classes, and admitted he had been surviving on ‘cash in hand’ work. As the visa was about to expire, he was urgently looking for a European bride to help him stay in the country. Ali told Miss Morter she would be free to leave him immediately after the wedding ceremony, although they would have to wait five years before they divorced. I object! But Paul Connolly, pictured behind the couple, stopped the ceremony when the registrar asked the congregation if anyone had any objections to the marriage . Rumbled: The journalists said they never expected the ceremony, assuming it would be blocked by the safeguards that are in place - but it wasn't . He even invented a back-story to help them fool the authorities, claiming they had met a year-and-a-half ago at Mile End tube station in East London when Miss Morter had lost her travel card. He told his prospective bride: ‘When I get the card, you can leave. That’s it, me and you. If I want a passport I need only one signature, that’s it. ‘I want to make money. Why do I have to go to university? I came here to make money.’ Interviewed on the programme, Mark Rimmer, superintendent registrar at Brent Council, said the number of sham marriages was ‘absolutely enormous’. He said: ‘In London we see that possibly one in five of our marriages are suspicious. ‘The goal is always the British passport. It is like gold dust. ‘We had a Lithuanian girl who spoke no English marrying a Pakistani male who spoke British and Urdu. I asked them how they communicate and they told me “through Google translate”.’ The journalists said they have made all their evidence available to the police. Mr Connolly said: ‘Neither Ali nor Elizabeth are hardened criminals. They tried to play the system, but lost. Getaway: The groom is then seen fleeing from the register office. It is not known whether he was arrested or charged for attempting to set up a sham marriage . ‘The truth is we never expected to end our investigation with a sham marriage ceremony. We assumed the road would be blocked by the safeguards that are in place. But it wasn’t.’ It is not known whether Ali or Elizabeth have been arrested or charged for attempting to set up a sham marriage. Earlier this year, the Home Affairs select committee said that sham marriages are ‘spiralling out of control’ in the UK, with as many as 10,000 fake weddings carried out each year.

"Tesco faced fresh embarrassment last night after it emerged its cold pork sausages were contaminated with chicken and turkey and its venison burgers contained lamb. The beleaguered supermarket giant admitted its DNA testing had found undeclared meat in five products on its shelves. The discovery comes just days after it emerged that Tesco had inflated its profit by at least £250million – amid claims it did so to cover up a slump in profits. A batch of Butcher’s Choice pork sausages, made by Tulip, contained up to five per cent undeclared turkey and chicken and ‘Kids Billy Bear’ turkey  slices were found to contain traces of chicken . Yesterday, Tesco admitted it had discovered between five and 30 per cent lamb in its venison burgers. Britain’s biggest retailer said it believed this was down to human error and that staff at supplier Two Sisters may have picked up the wrong meat. The supermarkets ‘Kids Billy Bear’ turkey and pork sausage slices, made by Feldhues, were also found to contain traces of chicken of between one and five per cent, The Grocer reported. Feldhues said it understood the chicken contamination came from its turkey supplier. Tesco said it believed the meat contamination was down to human error and that staff at supplier may have picked up the wrong meat . Meanwhile, a batch of Butcher’s Choice beef, pork and onion and turkey sausages, made by Tulip, contained between one and five per cent undeclared turkey and chicken. This was understood to have been caused by the cross-contamination of machinery by factories which made several different meat products on-site. Tesco said it was too late to withdraw the products from the shelves by the time the discovery had been made because the rest of the batch had been sold – and presumably eaten. The results were among 450 tests carried out on random meat products over the last quarter. Tesco became the first retailer to introduce DNA testing on its meat after being embroiled in the horsemeat scandal in 2013. During the row, it emerged Tesco’s ‘minced beef’ in its frozen bolognese was up to 100 per cent horsemeat. The value range ready-meal was made by Comigel, a French firm, was also linked to contaminated products at Findus and Aldi. Tim Smith, Tesco’s group quality director, said: ‘The presence of chicken, turkey and sheep DNA in these five products does not render them unfit for human consumption or otherwise unsafe and does not represent a risk to public health. Tesco admitted it had discovered between five and 30 per cent lamb in its venison burgers . ‘We have insisted that our suppliers put in place improved process controls to prevent these problems reoccurring, and have made clear any future incidents of this type will have consequences.’ The supermarket has tested more than 6,000 products since the horsemeat scandal, which it publishes online on a quarterly basis. Its DNA testing has only flagged up one previous breach, when it found its Simply Roast meatloaf, supplied by UK firm Eurostock, contained five per cent horsemeat. Ben Reynolds, from campaigning food and farming alliance Sustain, said: ‘The news of contamination in Tesco’s sausages, burgers, and meat slices clearly shows that lessons have not been learned from the horsemeat scandal. ‘It shows that recent recommendations from government are not having the required impact - we are still seeing animal carcasses mixed up and, yet again, the public are in the dark about what meat they’re eating. ‘If consumers want to be sure that the meat they are buying is responsibly produced and accurately labelled, they should buy it from suppliers they know they can trust, looking out for certification labels which guarantee meat is produced to the highest standards, such as organic and RSPCA certified meat. ‘ . Yesterday, Two Sisters said they were ‘extremely concerned to be informed by our customer of an instance of lamb traces in a pack of venison burgers’, which were processed at their site in Cornwall in May. A spokesman said: ‘We have concluded that this incident is a case of human error that may have occurred at any point in the supply chain and not a deliberate or malicious act. ‘However, this is still wholly unacceptable and we have since enhanced a number of our working practices and controls to reassure our customers and their consumers that our processes are as thorough and robust as they can be.’ Tulip told The Grocer it was ‘very disappointed’ to have fallen below its own high-quality standards in relation to the Butcher’s Choice sausages, but was confident ‘the issues identified have been fully addressed’. And Feldhues insisted it only processed turkey and pork but ‘had identified a supplier of turkey as the source of the small proportion of chicken meat’. Yesterday, it emerged that Tesco finance director Laurie McIlwee will still receive his £1m payoff despite an accounting scandal that has engulfed the grocer this week. While McIlwee has not been accused of any wrong doing, but the timing of the award will embarrass under-pressure chairman Sir Richard Broadbent. The firm announced in April that McIlwee was to be replaced but it said he would be available to help with the ‘transition’ to a new finance director over the following six months. However it has since emerged that McIlwee was told by former chief executive Philip Clarke not to come into the office since April and Tesco has been in the unusual position of having no finance director in the interim. It is thought that it was during this period that the accounting mistake occurred. New finance director Alan Stewart was drafted in three months earlier than planned from Marks & Spencer this week. Last night a Tesco spokeswoman said: ‘Investigations into each incident have concluded that production line error was responsible and we have worked with suppliers to ensure their controls are effective and our stringent standards are met every time.’","Tesco admitted its DNA testing had found undeclared meat in five products .

"Left wing luvvies, artists and celebrities poured hundreds of thousands of pounds into the Labour party's coffers last night - as the party ramped up its fundraising drive ahead of the next election. Two games of five-a-side football with a team of Labour 'all stars' including Ed Balls, Jim Murphy, Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, went for £24,000, while £1,000 was raised after Hollywood star Patrick Stewart offered to record a phone voicemail. One bidder is understood to have pledged more than £105,000 for artist Antony Gormley's 'Small Turn III' - a 106cm pillar of blocks made of cast iron. And a ceramic lion with the words 'Vote Labour' made by Grayson Perry, the cross-dressing artist, went for £42,000, according to one Labour MP at the event. Despite telling voters there is a cost of living crisis in the UK, the top draw at the Labour summer party was a cast iron sculpture by Sir Antony Gormley which had a reserve price of £100,000 and sold for £105,000 . Labour 'all star' footballer Ed Balls will play two games of five-a-side with other shadow cabinet ministers, after a party supporter stumped up £24,000 for the honour . This ceramic lion with the words 'Vote Labour' made by cross dressing artist Grayson Perry sold for £42,000 . Labour was accused of ‘staggering hypocrisy’  for refusing to publish the names of the guests who attended the lavish fundraising dinner with Ed Miliband. Star Trek actor Patrick Stewart, Bianca Jagger and Stephen Fry attended the fundraising ‘gala’ dinner. Labour has refused to comment on who was on the guest list for last night's event at the trendy Roundhouse music venue in Camden, north London. The fundraising auction, presided over by Nick Finch - the director at Christie’s - also sold off three bits of art by Mark Wallinger, Nicola Green and Anish Kapoor - for £60,000 in total. Grayson Perry attended last night's lavish bash. One of his works - a ceramic lion with the words 'Vote Labour sold for £42,000 . A 'premium table' for nine guests at last night's star-studden 'Election Gala Dinner' cost £15,000 – more than a year's wage on the minimum wage. But the amount of cash marked down as a 'donation' on the ticket was £7,000 – just below the level at which gifts must be declared to the Electoral Commission. Members of the shadow cabinet were guests on the most expensive tables, as well as some former cabinet ministers such as Lord Kinnock. More than 600 guests turned up for the event, which came a week after the Tories held their lavish 'summer ball' at the exclusive Hurlingham Club in west London. The Labour supporters were entertained by acrobats and dancers and dined on asparagus, monkfish and rhubarb custard on tables surrounded by flowers, ivy and trees. According to the Financial Times, comedian Stephen Fry introduced Mr Miliband claiming that the Tories’ first duty was to the 'rich and reprehensible' while Labour stood for ordinary workers and the vulnerable. Mr Miliband told the crowd that the next general election was 'ours to win'. He added: 'This is a battle of ideas, not about bandwagons or photo opportunities.' He added: 'Some people have been saying some things in newspapers – they’ve been saying it because they fear we’ll win.' Artist Grayson Perry arrived in a sequin dress and green platform shoes while comedian Eddie Izzard had red lipstick and painted nails. Former . cabinet minister Lord Mandelson was joined by TV presenter and Mail . columnist Janet Street-Porter while ex-leader Neil Kinnock, now Baron . Kinnock, was with wife Glenys.

"If food no longer smells appetising and perfume seems less pungent, you could be seriously ill. Men and women who have lost their sense of smell are almost six times more likely as others to die within the next five years, a study found. The inability to identify fish, rose, leather, orange, and peppermint – the five scents used in the experiment – could predict death within five years, scientists said. While the finding may seem odd, a poor sense of smell raises the odds of death more than established medical conditions including cancer. Scroll down for video . U.S. scientists have found men and women who lose their sense of smell are almost six times more likely as others to die within the next five years. File picture . The U.S. researchers said that while the dulling of the sense does not directly cause death, it provides ‘early warning that something has gone badly wrong’. They believe that a simple smell test could be used to identify pensioners most at risk of an early death. University of Chicago researcher Jayant Pinto said: ‘Of all the human senses, smell is the most undervalued and underappreciated – until it’s gone.’ But British experts urged people not to panic – and said that much more research is needed to confirm the link. In the first study of its kind, more than 3,000 men and women aged between 57 and 85 were put through a three-minute smell test. They were asked to sniff the scent given off by felt tip-pen like gadgets and given four possible answers. They did this five times. The fragrances used were, in order of increasing difficulty, peppermint, fish, orange, rose and leather. The inability to identify fish, rose, leather, orange, and peppermint – the five scents used in the experiment – could predict death within five years, scientists said . Most of the men and women got at least four of the five right, meaning they had a normal sense of smell. Almost 20 per cent only identified two or three of the smells – indicating a mild loss of the sense. Some 3.5 per cent got one or none right – and were judged to be ‘anosmic’ – or to have lost their sense of smell. Five years later, 430 of the men and women had died. Those who had failed the smell test were almost six times as likely to have died as those with a healthy sense of smell, the journal PLOS ONE reports. The finding could be partly explained by age, gender and socio-economic status. But, even when these were taken into account, someone without a sense of smell was more than three times as likely to have died. The US researchers said that while the dulling of the sense does not directly cause death, it provides ‘early warning that something has gone badly wrong’ Even a moderate loss of sense of smell raised the odds of an early death. What is more the link wasn’t simply due to those with poor sense of smell having lost their appetite, or drinking or smoking more, having cancer or heart problems or being generally frail. In fact, not being able to smell things provides a more accurate warning of an early death than cancer or heart failure. Only severe liver damage is more strongly linked to dying within five years. Dr Pinto said: ‘We think that loss of sense of smell is like the canary in the coal mine. ‘It doesn’t directly cause death, but it’s a harbinger, an early warning that something has gone badly wrong.’ One possibility is that the health of the olfactory nerve, which carries information on smell from the nose to the brain, is a sign of overall health. If it has become old, worn and unable to repair itself, the brain and body may be in the same position. Another possible explanation is that infections, poisons and pollutants that we breathe in damage our sense of smell before harming the brain and body. Dr Pinto said: ‘Pollution can affect heart, lung and brain disease, predisposing to early death.’ Dr Martha McClintock, the study’s senior author, said: ‘This evolutionary ancient special sense may signal a key mechanism that affects human longevity.’ Nirmal Kumar, a consultant head and neck surgeon, described the research as interesting – but questioned the reliability of the smell test used. He would give a patient 40 different fragrances, rather than just five, to establish if they have lost their ability to identify smells. Professor Kumar, honorary secretary of ENT UK, the British association for ear, nose and throat specialists, added that people who are starting to lose their sense of smell shouldn’t panic. However, they should seek medical help as previous studies have linked the loss with the early stage of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.","Those who lose smell six times likely as others to die within next five years .

"BBC presenters have been accused of being ‘insensitive’ when interviewing losing British competitors. Sports editor David Bond sparked 162 complaints after the cycling road race when he questioned Mark Cavendish, which elicited an angry response from the rider. Jill Douglas was criticised for her interview with Victoria Pendleton after a disqualification, and the attitude of other presenters have prompted a storm of anger from viewers. GB track cyclist Victoria Pembleton secured a gold medal yesterday after previously being disqualified in an earlier team event . Commiserating: Rebecca Adlington was 'comforted' after taking bronze by Sharron Davies . There were also 152 complaints after a joke by Gary Lineker about how many medals Germany had won. The BBC has been hit by claims that it has been 'insensitive' when interviewing losing competitors from the British team. Complainants have accused interviewers of being too brutal or negative with clearly disappointed contestants. Last weekend David Bond asked Cavendish after the 250km race: 'Was Tour de France tiredness a factor? The cyclist reacted angrily and said: 'Stop asking stupid questions. Do you know about cycling?' The BBC was deluged with complaints that Mr Bond's report was of 'poor quality' and biased against the British team. And people took to Twitter to vent their frustration at the 'negative and insensitive' approach they feel many BBC presenters have adopted. Referring to interviews where Team GB lost out on medals, Twitter users said BBC interviewers needed to approach the athletes with a little more sensitivity.

Swimming champion Sharron Davies has . come under fire for 'commiserating' with Olympian Rebecca Adlington, . asking her if she was disappointed with her bronze medal in the 800m . race. User Sam Gray ‏tweeted: 'Disappointment for winning bronze, are you bloody crazy? Sometimes the BBC reporters are as insensitive as they come. You swim 800m!!!' Sharron Davies has come under fire for her harsh approach to interviewing . Emer Walsh wrote: 'Sharon (sic) Davies...you are arguably one of the worst post sport interviewers ever....' The interview with triathlete Helen Jenkins, who came fifth, also provoked anger from the audience. One Twitter user, under the name Steven Stokes said: 'BBC's Olympic coverage is superb but tone of Helen Jenkins interview was inappropriate. Made her sound like a failure. Amazing effort by her.' Victoria Allen ‏agreed with the comment, saying: 'Insensitive BBC commentator just then covering the women's triathalon post race interviews' Others have claimed the interviews with British judo competitors have been too downbeat, after GB judo contender Euan Barton was knocked out of the competition and nearly in tears while a reporter tried to interview him. One seething Twitter user called James Phillips wrote: 'I can't believe the BBC were so insensitive. To interview Euan Barton then was cruel and unnecessary. Cycling reporter Jill Douglas was criticised for being insensitive when she spoke to cyclist Victoria Pendleton after she and her partner Jess Varnish were disqualified from a race. One viewer said: 'The BBC's coverage of the Games is almost superb, but some of the Interviewers are quite insensitive when interviewing sportsmen and women when they have just finished competing.' Another said: 'No sportsman/woman needs to be told when they haven't achieved their best, they all know that. Please be more sensitive.' One added: 'Strongly feel BBC journalists should not bully unsuccessful athletes until they crack & cry. It does NOT make good tv. It's insensitive.' Responding to the David Bond criticisms, the BBC said: 'We believe the report was balanced as it reflected the enormous recent success of the British cycling team and, as such, the sense of disappointment at the lack of a medal.' But at least one presenter has been praised for her upbeat attitude; Claire Balding has been widely applauded for her hilarious and heartwarming interview with the flabbergasted father of 100m butterfly winner Chad Le Clos.

"Chick-fil-A says it's removing high-fructose corn syrup from its white buns and artificial dyes from its sauces and dressings as part of a push to improve its ingredients. The fast-food chicken chain says the reformulated buns are being tested in about 200 Georgia locations, while the sauces and dressings will be tested starting early next year. It says it also removed a yellow dye from its chicken soup and that the new recipe should be in all restaurants by the end of this month. Chick-fil-A says it's removing high-fructose corn syrup from its white buns and artificial dyes from its sauces and dressings . Bye-bye yellow dye: A new soup will be available at Chick-Fil-A by the end of this month . It's also testing a new peanut oil, with hopes of a rollout early next year. The changes come after blogger Vani Hari wrote a post in 2011 titled 'Chick-fil-A or Chemical Fil-A?' on her site, FoodBabe.com. It noted that the chain's sandwich had nearly 100 ingredients, including peanut oil with TBHQ, a chemical made from butane. Hari, based in Charlotte, N.C., continued writing about Chick-fil-A's ingredients. Then last year, the company invited her to its headquarters to spend the day talking with executives. 'They took my concerns and started developing a road map of how to address them,' Hari said. On Wednesday, she said she was notified about the changes in an email from the company. Ingredients in packaged and fast foods . are coming under greater scrutiny as more people look to stick to diets . they feel are natural. Last year, for instance, PepsiCo Inc. said it . would remove a controversial ingredient from Gatorade in response to . customer demand, and Kraft Foods recently confirmed to the AP that it . was reformulating select varieties of its macaroni and cheese to remove . artificial dyes. Vani Hari met with Chick-Fil-A execs to discuss menu changes for the year 2014 . Vani Hari sparked controversy when she published information on her site saying that Cick-Fil-A sandwiches were partially  made from butane . Still, companies typically don't like publicizing such changes because it could bring unwanted attention over other ingredients or other products. Chick-fil-A, for instance, hasn't made any announcements about its recently reformulated products. Jodie Worrell, who works in Chick-fil-A product strategy and development, confirmed the changes in an interview and said the company has been working on improving the ingredients in its foods for several years, starting with the removal of trans fats. High-fructose corn syrup was also recently removed from other dressings. 'We've been systemically going through (the menu),' she said. David Farmer, vice president of product strategy and development, noted that Chick-fil-A would likely keep making changes. 'More and more these days, we've become a kind of food culture. People seem to care a lot more about what's in it, how it's made and where did it come from,' he said.

"A teenage amputee made a friend for life when he met a three-legged Dachshund who recognized they were in the 'same situation.' It was last August that Sam Sartain lost control while riding his ATV, which flipped and landed on his leg. NBC reports that doctors were forced to conduct a series of amputations on him that removed more and more of his right leg. Best friends: Sam Sartain lost his leg to an ATV accident in 2013 and says that Pooh, once a stray three-legged dog, recognizes how similar they both are . The surgeries pushed him so far to his limits that he became thin and required a feeding tube. Once that ordeal was done, Sartain was fitted with a prosthetic leg in May that had him back walking and eventually playing school sports. 'It’s cool because when I went back to school, not only did I have that respect as a person, but as an athlete too,' he said. But he really felt whole once he met Pooh, a stray dog who almost lost his life after being struck by a car. Sartain's mother Judy says she came across a Facebook page for rescue Dachshunds and found a dog with a similar story to her son searching for a family. 'As a mom you search for any resources that can help and animals are very therapeutic and they give you a reason to get up,' Judy said. Family: Sam not only found a friend, Pooh found a home with the Sartains, who welcomed him in after he was rescued . Long road: Pooh was hit by a car, and vets said he lost blood and his right hind leg couldn't be saved, but after surgery, Pooh pulled through . Miami-Dade Animal Services found Pooh after he had been hit by a car. Officers brought him to Dachshund Rescue South Florida, which raised $5,000 in two days for his critical surgery. When he first arrived, loss of blood and trauma made vets uncertain Pooh could withstand surgery, and he had to be stabilized before the operation. 'The thing that was similar between me and Pooh,' Sartain said 'was the complete top layer of skin was just torn off, you could see the bones.' After Pooh's recovery, the two were introduced and formed an instant bond. 'It’s a weird feeling,' Sartain said, 'because he looked at me and he realized I guess that we had the same situation and he immediately ran over towards me.'","Sam Sartain lost his leg last August in an accident when his ATV flipped and landed on his leg .

Murray paid tribute to his opponents and cohort as his season ended on a far more enjoyable note than the 6-0 6-1 lesson given to him on Thursday night by Federer in their final group match.

"While many girls fret about being skinny in order to make it as a model, the career of Australian Robyn Lawley reached new heights after she embraced her curves.

She revealed: 'I started out doing regular modelling as a teenager but I couldn't maintain a size 6 to 8 figure and that's what size all the samples are. 'I'm tall and I have big hips and shoulders. Even if I diet I can't shrink my bones. I had tried to be that skinny I would have ended up in hospital.' Instead, a friend recommended Robyn tried plus-size modelling and she hasn't looked back. Now she's in demand for editorial and commercial work and has launched her own swimwear range.  She said that she doesn't feel under pressure to diet to be part of the fashion industry so has no plans to lose her curves, like other plus-size models before her such as Crystal Renn. Robyn explained: 'I am the perfect shape for plus-size modelling. I don't feel any pressure to lose weight as I've been this size for years now and I don't want to change or diet. I enjoy exercising and being able to eat foods I like.' Body confident: Robyn Lawley said she's not going to diet and doesn't covet a size 8 figure . She added: 'It must annoy some of the . other models when they see the plus-size models eating after they have . starved themselves all night.' But . she admitted being plus-size can be both a gift and a curse in the . fashion world and a lot still needs to be done to make curvaceous girls more accepted and catered for. 'Being a plus-size model in an industry . where there aren't many means there are some opportunities I wouldn't . have had otherwise,' she said. 'But there are also less jobs available, particularly . in mainstream and high-end fashion. 'I . know a lot of stunning girls who are not working because being a size 8 to 14 you are in no man's land even though you have a normal, healthy . body.' She added that she has had to work hard to prove herself as a model because of her size. 'People are surprised when I turn up on a . shoot and I can model. But why shouldn't I be able to do it just because . I'm a size 16?' she said. While . Robyn has had worldwide success in magazines and campaigns, she has had . little work on the catwalk and she blames this on designers' reluctance . to use models who are bigger than a size 8. Role model: The Australian wishes there were more plus-size models like her . She said: 'It's disappointing as I love catwalk modelling, it's more . exciting than being on a shoot so it sucks not to be included. 'Plus-size . models are being used more in magazines and in the media but not on the . runway and not by high-end designers like Prada. I'd love them to use . more curvy girls but it's like a taboo and I don't know why. It screams . lack of diversity.' Her own career ambitions aside, the model claims that the lack of larger catwalk models is also damaging for young girls. She said: 'It doesn't send out a good message to teenager girls who are impressionable. They're not coat hangers, they're girls and it's bad for them to only see skinny frames on the catwalk. I hope I can be a strong role model for them but there's not enough of us plus-size models.' Robyn's values sit well with MiLK Management who also aim to celebrate diversity, which is reflected in their latest campaign showcasing their clients who include Ill Manors actor Sean Sagar, former X Factor contestants Union J and and another plus size model, Felicity Hayward. Founder, Anna Shillinglaw, a former model, describes MiLK as a boutique agency that understands no two models are alike. She said: 'MiLK has been instrumental in pushing the boundaries in terms of diversity, we believe that there is no longer a standard size for modelling and we look at everyone's potential individually. It's about offering something unique and special to clients.' MiLK's roster has already seen their models like Robyn grace covers from Italian Vogue to i-D, star in campaigns from Chanel to Victoria Secrets and runway shows from Calvin Klein to PPQ. In 2013 they launched MiLK Special Bookings headed up by Calvin Morris, who prior to joining the agency, helped guide the career of Kate Moss for more than nine years. The #MeetMiLK campaign aims to show off the agency's diversity of talent and features Union J and Lucille Boston the fashion dog .

"China's first school for butlers has opened in a sprawling upmarket villa - and it is run entirely by westerners. The International Butler Academy offers £11,000-a-head courses to youngsters desperate to cash in on the rise of China's super-rich and the 'Downton Abbey effect'. Recruits in smart three-piece suits are whisked through a punishing eight-week regime which includes shoe-shining, table-laying and pouring wine before working for the East's rising elite. Students pay £11,000 to join the butler course to cater for China's new super-rich who love Downton Abbey . The eight-week course teaches students how to shine shoes and pour wine for the new billionaire Chinese . The International Butler Academy is located in a mansion in Chengdu China which opened for business in July . The academy opened in July at a multi-million pound villa in Chengdu, China, which has a swimming pool, two saunas and a bar. Behind the idea was Dutchman Robert Wennekes, once a butler for 'one of America's wealthiest billionaires' who served as head butler for the U.S. Embassy in Germany. The 56-year-old, whose firm already runs a similar school in a 14th Century castle in the Netherlands, is cashing in on the desire for western customs and traditions from the super-rich businessmen of cities like Shanghai. Western butler training schools had already been sending many of their graduates overseas to Chinese families. Students learn how to lay tables and travel to some of Europe's great homes to learn first-hand how its done . As well as learning all the skills to become a butler, the students are also given their uniform to star work . Graduates of the academy can expect to earn anything between £30,000 and £90,000 a year . Now the 'academy' claims to be the first permanent, accredited butler school in China - and it is proving popular. Young recruits pay £10,900 for their eight-week course, which includes a full uniform, field trips to grand homes in Europe and all meals during the training. The budding butlers learn how to set tables using rulers, polish silver forks and crystal wine glasses, iron tablecloths and pour wine for their masters. When they graduate classes given by tutors from Canada, the U.S., Belgium and Switzerland, the academy claims they can expect to earn anywhere from £30,000 up to £90,000. While the Eurozone is still struggling to pull out of the longest recession in its history, China's economy is growing by more than 7 per cent every year and shows little sign of slowing down. Graduates are taught by tutors from Canada, the US, Belgium and Switzerland who have years of experience . Students are taught that attention to detail is everything when it comes to serving in a great house . With the Chinese economy growing on average by 7 per cent a year, there is a huge market for butlers . A manufacturing boom and the relaxation of some of the Communist nation's state controls has led to a new generation of super-rich investors. They splash out on opulent homes - often in wealthy areas of London - fast cars, and sending their children to England's top private schools and universities. Michel Hockx, Professor of Chinese at SOAS University of London, said using western culture had a lot to do with status symbols. 'The fundamental reason for all this is that Chinese people now have the opportunity to distinguish themselves from other people in the country,' he told MailOnline. 'It started with the way people dress, then it was hobbies, then foreign travel - it's one thing after another. 'It's now accepted that China has become a class society, which is strange because it's still a communist country, at least in name. Super-rich Chinese see television shows such as Downton Abbey and think that they now need a butler . Female butlers are in great demand in the Middle East and the Far East due to cultural sensitivities . The academy said it is the first accredited institution of its type in operation in China . 'They seek to emulate what they see to be upper class life in countries like the UK, U.S. and elsewhere. You could compare it with what the U.S. went through half a century ago when there was a lot of imitation. 'English literature from the Romantic era still has an enormous appeal and China has millions of fans of shows like Sherlock or Downton Abbey. 'It betrays a certain lack of confidence in one's own culture, but in time this will change.' Despite the reputation of British butlers, Mr Wennekes insists the best now come from Switzerland. The academy's website adds: 'The French invented the butler and the Americans invented the modern butler. Most butlers are employed in the U.S. and in the Middle East.' There is another stereotype which is fast dying out - that 'butlering' is a profession reserved only for men. If a candle is being reused it is vital that the wax drippings are removed with a razor blade to avoid offence . Before any formal dinner it is important that the napkins are ironed with a military-type precision . The International Butler Academy in China advertises itself 'by royal appointment' Buckingham Palace advertised for its first female butlers in 2004 and many of the students at the new school in China are women. 'Female butlers are sometimes preferred, especially for work within Middle and Far Eastern families where it may be culturally problematic for males to work closely with females in a household,' the academy said. 'Western female celebrities may also prefer a female butler, as may households where the wife is driving the decision to hire a butler.' A good butler should ensure that there are no water marks on the crystal and never the remains of lipstick . Students at the academy are expected to work a 14-hour shift - preparing them for life with the super-rich . Before starting work each morning the students must clean the entire house from top-to-bottom . The students practice serving dinner to the CEO of the academy Thomas Haufmann, left .","International Butler Academy opened in sprawling villa in Chengdu, China .

"Vandals have spray painted the word 'evil' across the front of a 60-year-old mosque in a small town in far north Queensland. Worshippers arrived at the mosque in Mareeba, inland from Cairns, on Friday morning to find their place of worship defaced with the yellow paint. Mareeba Mayor Tom Gilmore said the act was deeply saddening and the mosque had been part of the community since the 1950s. Scroll down for video . Worshippers arrived at the mosque in Mareeba, inland from Cairns, on Friday morning to find their place of worship defaced with the yellow paint . 'This is entirely unacceptable behaviour by anybody in this community,' he said soon after visiting the site on Friday. 'The thing that is deeply saddening is that it has been in this community since the mid-fifties. 'I don't think it's ever been defaced before in that time.' Mr Gilmore said a large group of 'highly respected' Muslims had lived in the community since the 1920s. He said the graffiti was visible from the street.

"Phil Neville changed his diet after being persuaded by wife Julie . Manchester United coach joins David Haye and Serena Williams on diet . The 37-year-old is set to be sacked as Manchester United coach . Neville was told by executive vice chairman Ed Woodward he has no future at Old Trafford after Sunday's Premier League 1-1 draw at Southampton . Goalkeeping coach Chris Woods has also been axed by Woodward . Gary Neville wants United to not panic buy this summer . Neville insists the club should promote youth rather than going for lesser targets . Phil Neville has swapped allegiances, from red to green, as the former Manchester United player has become a vegetarian. The 37-year-old has been on a meat-free diet for a few weeks after his wife Julie persuaded him to do so and it is a decision Neville hasn't regretted. VIDEO Scroll down to see Phil Neville discuss his new diet . New man: Phil Neville (right) has become a vegetarian after being persuaded by his wife . Food for thought: Neville (centre) was told on Sunday that his Manchester United coaching career was over . In an interview for animal rights charity PETA he said: 'I always used to think as a footballer, as a sportsman, that it was so important for me to eat meat, to have that in my diet. 'I thought if I became a vegetarian that would take away a lot of the nutrients that I would require to be a professional footballer and an athlete. I was really ignorant.' Neville is the latest professional sportsperson to opt for a vegetarian diet which includes tennis star Serena Williams, former athlete Carl Lewis and boxer David Haye. The former England international rejoined United as a coach at the start of the season as part of former Red Devils' boss David Moyes' backroom staff. Eyes on the prize: Tennis star Serena Williams has also opted a meat-free diet in her life . However, after a tumultuous campaign at the club he was informed by executive vice chairman Ed Woodward that, along with goalkeeping coach Chris Woods, he had no future at the club following United's 1-1 draw at Southampton on Sunday. Neville's older brother Gary believed the deposed Premier League champions have panicked in the transfer market and the wants the club to only spend their money on quality signings. Speaking on Sky Sports, Neville hopes expected United boss Louis van Gaal fine tunes the squad where necessary in order for the the club to compete for honours again. ‘Luis Van Gaal is potentially going to get the job and he will have to asses it. It won’t happen overnight, but they have a great chance to get back into the Champions League, especially as they have no European football next season,' he said. ‘If he decides he wants eight players, that doesn’t mean he should go and buy eight players. Signing three or four real top quality – and improving next season, bedding them in and then going again with two or three more the year after is the organic approach I would expect Manchester United to have. ‘However, I didn’t expect Manchester United to sack a manager after ten months, so what’s going to happen in the next few months, who knows?' Panic buy: Maroaune Fellaini joined Manchester United for £27.5million on deadline day in August . Under sacked Manchester United boss David Moyes, the club struggled to acquire their much publicised summer targets - something Neville doesn't want a repeat of. ‘United have panicked into signing players who were not the top choices,' he added. ‘It was quite public last summer who United’s targets were – it was either Bale or Ronaldo, it was Fabregas, it was Baines and it was Fellaini. They were the targets, it was publicised – and I don’t know why because Manchester United have always kept their transfer dealings really quiet. I’m not quite sure how all of a sudden everyone knows who they are signing. Dream debut: James Wilson (left) scored twice on his Manchester United debut in a 3-1 vs Hull in May . ‘But if they can’t get No 1, No 2, three or four - I’m not in a rush. As a Manchester United fan, I’d rather seen James Wilson come through than some fourth choice striker who isn’t at the top of the list. ‘I don’t want signing number eight, nine or 10, because they can’t get No 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 - I have no interest in that. ‘I’m a supporter too, I want signings, as fan. I (only) want quality players.’","Phil Neville changed his diet after being persuaded by wife Julie .

"Detective Hercule Poirot is set to make a triumphant return in a new thriller - almost four decades after he last featured in an Agatha Christie novel. The Monogram Murders is to be written by poet and crime novelist Sophie Hannah and is set for release on September 8. The publication comes almost 39 years after the last Poirot novel Curtain - which was published in September 1975. Hercule Poirot, pictured here played by actor David Suchet, will return in a new thriller novel called The Monogram Murders. It will be written by crime novelist Sophie Hannah and published on September 8 . Hugh Fraser, David Suchet and Philip Jackson star in The Mysterious Affair At Styles - published by Christie in 1920. The prolific author's family have backed the latest novel - which will be released in 29 languages . The detective, who was famous for his reliance on his 'the little grey cells' for solving crimes, was  killed off in the book - but Ms Hannah is said to be avoiding this creative set-back by setting her story early in Poirot's career. The Monogram Murders will be told from the perspective of a new character - a policeman - who knows Poirot and asks for his involvement in the case. Other famous Christie characters will make cameo appearances in the book - which will be published in 29 languages in 50 countries. The novelist has today said writing the book, which comes four decades after Agatha Christie's last novel Sleeping, was a great honour. Novelist and Poirot fan Sophie Hannah (left) said writing the book was 'extraordinary'. Her novel Kind Of Cruel (right) was nominated for Crime Thriller of the Year in 2013 . She added she had read scores of Chrisitie's previous works in preparation for the book. Sophie Hannah said: 'As a huge fan of Agatha Christie, it has been an extraordinary experience revisiting all of her magnificent novels and creating a Poirot mystery of my own. I cannot tell you how thrilled I am to be part of this story.' Ms Hannah says she was asked to write the book after a lunch with her editor - who knew Christie's publishers HarperCollins were taking on contemporary novelists to re-write other classic novels. Born in Manchester, Ms Hannah lives in Cambridge with her husband and two children. She was a Fellow Commoner in Creative Arts at Trinity College, Cambridge between 1999 and 2001. She was also a junior research fellow at Wolfson College, Oxford, before embarking on a career as a writer. Although Ms Hannah has written scores of poems and children's books, she is best know for her eight crime novels - some of which have been adapted for television. Her 2008 novel The Point of Rescue was transformed into two-part drama Case Sensitive - shown on ITV. Her novel Kind of Cruel was shortlisted for the Specsavers National Book Awards Crime Thriller of the Year in 2013. She is also expected to publish another novel this year calling The Telling Error. In an interview with the Western Daily Press, she said: 'My agent knew that HarperCollins was Agatha Christie's publisher and suggested that if they were doing that sort of thing, they should get Sophie Hannah to write an Agatha Christie novel'. Ms Hannah then met with the author's family - who have since backed the project. Speaking about meeting Christie's family, she said: 'Well, actually when I met them, I didn't think it was going to happen, so I wasn't that daunted. 'I felt daunted when they liked it and thought, ""Yikes! Now I actually have to do this!""' Christie's grandson Matthew Prichard said: 'Agatha Christie would have been really honoured at the thought of so many people around the world enjoying a new Poirot story and I am certain that all those who read Sophie Hannah’s novel will be reminded of the ingenious character my grandmother created.' Hilary Strong, MD, Acorn Productions, which manages the rights to the Agatha Christie estate added: 'As we continue to build the Christie brand globally we are delighted to be working with HarperCollins and our publishing partners around the world to make this a truly memorable publishing event.' Belgium Poirot is one of the most famous literary detectives in history - appearing in 33 novels, over 50 short stories and two plays between 1920 and 1975. He is also one of Christie's most famous and loved characters - appearing in numerous screen adaptations, portrayed by several well-respected actors. David Suchet is perhaps the most famous example - playing the detective in television series Agatha Christie's Poirot between 1989 and 2013. Agatha Christie, left, with actress Margaret Lockwood in 1976. She wrote her last Poirot novel - Curtain - in September 1975 shortly before her death in 1976 . Born in Manchester, Ms Hannah lives in Cambridge with her husband and two children. She was a Fellow Commoner in Creative Arts at Trinity College, Cambridge and a junior research fellow in Oxford. She is best know for her eight crime novels - some of which have been adapted for television. Her 2008 novel The Point of Rescue, for example, was transformed into two-part drama Case Sensitive - shown on ITV. Her novel Kind of Cruel was shortlisted for the Specsavers National Book Awards Crime Thriller of the Year in 2013. She is also expected to publish another novel this year calling The Telling Error. David Suchet in How Does Your Garden Grow, a show from the Third Series of the ITV programme . Fictional Belgian detective Hercule Poirot was created by Agatha Christie, making his first appearance in novel The Mysterious Affair at Styles - published in 1920. He made his exit in Curtain, published in 1975, dying from heart complications. His passing saw him gain an obituary on the front page of the New York Times. Between 1920 and 1975, he appeared in 33 novels, 50 short stories and two plays named Black Coffee and Alibi. The character has been adapted from film, television and radio and has been played by scores of actors - including Tony Randall, David Suchet and John Moffatt. The first actor to portray the detective was Charles Laughton in 1928 in the play Alibi. It was an adaptation by Michael Morton from the novel The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. Austin Trevor played the character in the screen production of the show a few years later. David Suchet is quite possibly the most famous Poirot, starring in the ITV series from 1989 to June 2013 - when he said he was leaving the role. Aptly, his last appearance was in an adaptation of final novel Curtain: Poirot's Last Case. It aired on 13 November 2013. In An Autobiography, Christie sites Arthur Conan Doyle as a major inspiration, saying: 'I was still writing in the Sherlock Holmes tradition – eccentric detective, stooge assistant. Christie is said to have not particularly enjoyed writing the character. In 1930, she said she found Poirot 'insufferable'. OTHER NOVELS WRITTEN AFTER THE DEATH OF THE AUTHOR . Poirot is not the only character to be reborn following an author's death. Famously, scores of James Bond novels have been written following the death of Ian Fleming - including John Gardner's Licence to Kill and GoldenEye. The author wrote 16 Bond novels following the original author's death in 1964. Contemporary novelist Sebastian Faulks was commissioned to write a new Bond novel to mark the 100th anniversary of Fleming's birth. Devil May Care was published by Penguin Books and was released on 28 May 2008 . Solo, written by William Boyd was published in 2013. Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes featured in four novels and 56 short stories - but the character has also been adapted for screen, television and radio on scores of occasions since.","Hercule Poirot to make a comeback in thriller The Monogram Murders .

"The glittering ceremony for Ryan Giggs's lifetime achievement award was hailed by Sir Alex Ferguson as the 'most special night at Manchester United in many years' as football's greats queued up to leave touching tributes to the Premier League legend. Giggs was presented with his award at Old Trafford on Thursday night, with his playing career looking like it is drawing to a close after 26 brilliant years. Cristiano Ronaldo, Eric Cantona and David Beckham were among the club heroes to laud Giggs in special video messages, while the likes of Pele and Michel Platini also paid tribute to the Red Devils interim player-coach. Scroll down to watch video of Ryan Giggs and United's award ceremony . Legends: Ryan Giggs (right) is presented with the Lifetime Achievement award by Sir Bobby Charlton . The 40-year-old Welshman will wait until after the club's final game against Southampton on Sunday to decide whether he will continue as a player, join the new manager's backroom staff or manage at another club. Louis van Gaal is widely expected to be announced as David Moyes' successor in the next week - and his arrival could determine the Welshman's future. But his future was not imprtant on Thursday night, which was all about hailing Giggs's unparallelled career. Ferguson, who was Giggs's boss for all but one of his years as a United player, said: 'No one in this club deserves the award better than you. Everyone will applaud and rightly so. 'What a career: all the games you've played, the trophies you've won, all the help you've given young people and the help you've given me and the coaching staff. I think your award tonight is the most special night at Manchester United in many years.' Dream team: Sir Alex Ferguson paid tribute to his longest serving player at Old Trafford . Old pals: David Beckham delivers his video message as Giggs watches on stage . The greatest: Brazil legend Pele also sent Giggs his own message ahead of the World Cup this summer . Real Madrid . superstar and United great Ronaldo also sent a message to his . former team-mate. 'It was a pleasure for me to play with you,' he said. 'It was an unbelievable feeling to play with you at 18-years-old, I . learnt a lot with you.' Eric Cantona, perhaps the most influential player during Giggs' entire career at Old Trafford, said: 'You have been a great team-mate and a great friend and a great example for everyone. I hope you have a great life after your career as a player: in football as a manager, or whatever.' Another of Giggs's most high-profile former team-mates, David Beckham, was happy to poke fun at Giggs as well as hail him. 'You're an amazing servant for the game and more importantly an amazing servant for Manchester United,' said the former England captain. 'I can believe you're still playing at 40-years-old because you had Phil Neville doing all your running and me on the other side playing not bad balls to you!' Mark Hughes, now Stoke City manager, and Bryan Robson were two senior players at United when Giggs made his debut in March 1991. Hughes was quick to point out that Giggs's strike in the Manchester derby should have been awarded as an own goal. 'Pleasure to have the opportunity to play with you,' said Hughes. 'I always remember that first game when you came on as a skinny 17-year-old and scored the winner, which you didn't touch by the way.'

Robson, now . an ambassador at Old Trafford said: 'Before you pack in you'll probably . overtake Sir Alex (Ferguson) with the amount of awards and medals you've . won. Nobody deserves it more than you.' Giggs is one of the famed Class of '92 at United, who went on to great things after winning the FA Youth Cup that year. A less celebrated member of that team was Robbie Savage, who was released by the club but forged a top-flight career with Leicester and Derby, among others. And the now Match of the Day pundit had a cheeky message for Giggs. 'We know the real story of the FA Youth Cup - you took my place!' he joked. 'That could have been me in that dugout, that could have been me as the most decorated player in Premier League history. Gutted!' Another MOTD star, Gary Lineker, said: 'You're the only player still going in the Premier League who I played against - so that makes me feel slightly less old than I actually am. Thanks for that.' Former Italy and Juventus forward Alessandro Del Piero summed up the feeling by addressing Giggs simply as 'Legend'. And Pele, arguably the greatest footballer of all time, joined in the plaudits. 'My friend Giggs, good luck to you,' he said. 'You are an example for players and people who play our game. One day we're going to play together.' A clearly emotional Giggs told the audience at the ceremony: 'I'm not usually an emotional person. But this has touched me. To receive this Lifetime Achievement is something special, one of the most special awards I’ve ever received. 'This club touches everyone’s heart; it's not only a club, it’s a family. So many special people have been a part of that, so for me to win this is emotional and it’s a special night for me. 'I’ve played with so many great players who have had a massive impact on me, and of course Sir Alex Ferguson, who has been the single biggest influence on my career. I’m a lucky man.'","Sir Alex Ferguson said it was 'most special night' at club in years .

Show the skills: Luis Suarez takes on Daniel Agger during Friday's training session . So, you can control the ball? Suarez looks on with shock as team-mate Mamadou Sakho runs past . Should City fall to a shock home defeat by West Ham, Liverpool could steal in and snatch the title from under their noses if they beat Newcastle at Anfield. The Reds have stumbled in their last couple of games following a home loss to Chelsea and a draw at Crystal Palace, but remain favourites to defeat the Toon on Sunday and keep up the pressure on City. Liverpool trained at Melwood on Friday and with the title pressure off, looked relaxed as Brendan Rodgers' side looked to have recovered from letting a 3-0 lead slip at Palace on Monday night which severely dented their title aspirations. Speaking at his pre-match press . conference, Rodgers reflected that the Reds has enjoyed a . successful season regardless of Sunday's outcome and praised his . players' season performance.

However the Northern Irishman admitted he still hasn't recovered from the Palace capitulation, revealing he has watched the game three times. 'I have watched it three times and I'm still in shock at what happened. I can't believe how we get to 78 minutes with such control and did not win. 'The level of football shows we can cope with the pressure. You can only focus on what has happened and how we can improve. We have had a really successful season. 'Everyone at the start of the season probably thought the top four was a big ask yet here we are talking about the title. It's my job to make sure we improve again. 'I want to congratulate my players on this season. They have put Liverpool on the world map. Come Sunday we will fight to the very end. 'To come second to . the richest team in history of sport is incredible. This is only the . beginning. I see and hear about other teams that will improve but I . think we will improve dramatically.

'It's not over. We can only concentrate on our job. We have got a tough game. Us at home and our supporters, we have been a formidable occasion. 'To be successful you have to be able to lose. If you look over the years the great winners have been teams and individuals who have lost and gone on to become champions again. 'For us we have made great strides this season and there is still another game to go. 'If anyone had told us in August we would be top going into the last week of the season we would've taken it. 'We've qualified for the Champions League but there is an awful lot more we want to achieve. I found when I first came in they wanted to learn and wanted to be better.

"An obese man has beat the bulge in the name of love. Jake Golding, 23, from Leicester, had his first ever kiss after shrinking from 23st to just 15st. After meeting the love of his life online, Jake refused to let his beloved see his body when they chatted, making sure the camera stayed on his face. Desperate for his happily ever after, Jake took matters into his own hands and set up his own diet and exercise programme. Scroll down for video . Jake managed to drop from 23st (left) to 15st (right) in just eight months through a strict diet and exercise . A newly slimmed-down Jake met Carlisa in person for the first time after his weight loss, and experienced his first kiss. Jake said: 'I met Carlisa online in May last year, and we had an instant connection. 'We used to video chat a lot but I was always too scared to show her my body in case it put her off - I told her I was big but I never wanted to show her. 'She lives in New York but we wanted to make it work, so we agreed that she would come over this January as part of her studies for five months, but I wanted to lose as much weight as possible before then. 'Carlisa helped me gain confidence, and with the weight melting away, I felt like a new person. 'When we finally met it was just amazing - we were both each other's first relationship and it was incredible to share our first kiss together. 'We went to Paris whilst she was here and went to Disney Land and the Eiffel Tower - it was the best week of my life.' Jake, pictured before the weight loss, had never been kissed and was often the victim of cruel jibes from girls . Despite Carlisa insisting she would love Jake, whatever his size, after meeting, the pair are happier than ever. Jake said: 'Carlisa always says she wouldn't care if I was 8st or 50st but I wanted to be my best for her - she deserves the best of everything. 'Carlisa is definitely the woman for me and I know I will marry her someday. She's changed my life.' Jake struggled with his weight since he was a small child and was constantly taunted by bullies. Jake said: 'I was always big compared to the others and I was never really active. 'I hated PE, I just didn't want to get changed in front of everyone else, and I hated running. 'I tried not to let the comments phase me but I didn't have any confidence. 'All my mates were going out all the time and they had girlfriends. 'I didn't even want to try and find a girl. I stayed in because I didn't want to get turned down.' Jake found himself gorging on packets of crisps and chocolate every day. By the time he was 16 he weighed 20st. Carlisa and Jake met online and soon fell in love. They met up after Jake had lost weight and he had his first ever kiss . Jake said: 'I have a big family so there was a lot of food around so I could help myself whenever I wanted. 'I was too afraid to have a girlfriend as I thought I'd be rejected. 'Girls actually made the worst comments about me so I just focused on college and work instead. 'They turned their noses up at me - but now they're the girls who try and talk to me. 'I haven't bothered responding.' But after meeting Carlisa, and fed up of being so unfit, Jake decided to change his mindset and adopt a healthy new lifestyle. Jake said: 'I found myself struggling to fit in any clothes smaller than XXL with a 46in waist. 'I couldn't go shopping with friends because I didn't want to try anything on and there was only one shop in town that kept anything near my size. 'So I joined the gym and started training five days a week. 'It was pretty intense but I wanted to whatever I could to look my best for Carlisa. 'I had joined once before but never kept it going. This time I was determined to. Jake and Carlisa during their first week together, where they went to Paris and visited Disneyland . 'With the help of my brother, friends and research on the internet I came up with the brilliant diet. 'It was high in protein and low in carbs and at the same time I was training in the gym for between one and two hours a day. 'I've lost weight but now started bulking as well and have 10kg of muscle.' The going was tough as Jake abandoned breakfasts which could sometimes include four burgers, sausages, beans and toast, for porridge. But after losing a so much weight he's been left with excess skin on his stomach and legs. Jake said: I've been told that the only way to get rid of the excess skin is to pay to have it removed privately. Jake is hoping to raise money to get rid of excess skin on his stomach (left) but says he is happier than ever . 'I am working in engineering and am on a minimum wage - so  I don't think I will ever be able to afford to have that [surgery to remove excess skin] done, as it costs between £5,000 and £6,000.' 'It does make me feel very depressed and there are times when I am not sure how to overcome this. 'My one goal of being able to take my top off in front of other people and I just can't do that. 'I have met my dream woman and I'm so happy, I would just love to one day get rid of the excess skin, that would complete my journey.' Jake now goes to the gym twice a day and has his own fitness Instagram page - FatToMuscle. He said: 'I want to help others and show them that no matter how big you are you can really change all that. 'It takes a lot of dedication but if I can do it anyone can, you just have to keep going. 'Look at me, I'm now happier than ever and have the girl of my dreams.","Jake's weight was a problem from childhood and by 23 was 23st .

"A historic vote on growing demands for Britain to leave the European Union will be held in the Commons before Christmas. MPs will debate whether the Government should give voters a chance to decide the issue once and for all in a referendum. It will be the first time Parliament has held a major vote on seeking the public’s view since the 1975 referendum confirming the decision to join the Common Market. A historic vote on growing demands for Britain to leave the European Union will be held in the Commons before Christmas . If MPs vote in favour of  a referendum, the result would not be binding on the Government. But, combined with growing public opposition to the increasing power of the EU, it would put enormous pressure on David Cameron to let the people decide the country’s European fate. The Commons vote has been forced on MPs – and a reluctant Prime Minister –  by public demand after the crisis in the eurozone, with desperate attempts to prop up the Greek economy, led to a surge in anti-Brussels feeling. Prime Minister David Cameron. MPs will debate whether the Government should give voters a chance to decide the Europe issue in a referendum . The decision to hold a debate was made after a petition, signed by more than 100,000 people demanding a referendum, was submitted to a new group of MPs given the job of making sure Parliament does not sweep controversial issues under the carpet. The Mail on Sunday has learnt that the Commons Backbench Business Committee will agree to grant a one-day debate on a referendum after Parliament returns next week. Committee chairman Natascha Engel, a Labour MP, said: ‘Given the crisis in the eurozone, this issue has become more relevant than ever. There is a clear majority of backbench MPs who want to debate this and we have to respond to that. ‘The EU today is completely different from the one the British people voted to join in 1975. It is time to examine the position again. For years it has suited successive governments to avoid debating whether Britain should leave the EU. The whole purpose of my committee is to make sure the big issues of the day are aired in Parliament. People in pubs and shops all over Britain are discussing our membership of the EU and it is time MPs openly debated it too.’ The debate will be held before the end of the year.  Anti-European campaigners are divided over the question that should be put in a referendum. Some want a simple ‘in or out’ question. But others want to offer the choice of going back to an old- style trading association, along the lines of the Common Market which British voters agreed to 36 years ago. If the nation voted ‘yes’ to this, the Government could demand that key powers over immigration, health and safety, City regulations and other issues are handed back to Westminster. If the EU refused, Britain could leave altogether. Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Democrats Nick Clegg is an avowed Europhile. Labour MP Natascha Engel said the eurozone the issue has become more relevant than ever . In recent opinion polls, when asked . directly, nearly half of people want Britain to come out of the EU, with . about a third in favour of staying in. But when the question  was . rephrased to give the choice of returning to a Seventies-style trade . association, a clear majority chose that option. Tory MPs plan to use this week’s party conference in Manchester to step up their demand for a referendum. Withdrawing from the EU has support at . the highest level of the party, including from Mr Cameron’s senior No . 10 adviser, Steve Hilton. The Commons vote is a nightmare for . the Coalition. Mr Cameron was heavily criticised in Opposition for going . back on a pledge to hold a referendum on the 2007 Lisbon Treaty which . continued the process of switching sovereignty to the EU. He fears a referendum would be a . distraction from his attempts to solve Britain’s economic problems. But . he will face a mass revolt if he orders Tory MPs to vote against it. Protests in Greece over cut backs. The crisis in the eurozone with desperate attempts to prop up the Greek economy has led to a surge in anti-Brussels feeling . Although Deputy Prime Minister Nick . Clegg is an avowed Europhile, he made an Election pledge to hold an ‘in . or out’ EU referendum. It was seen as a crude Lib Dem ploy to prove that . whatever their reservations about the EU, most Britons want to stay in. But with growing hostility to the EU, Mr Clegg may now be hoist with . his own petard. A sizeable number of Labour MPs also want a referendum. The historic Commons debate is set to . be agreed after Tory MP David Nuttall approached the Backbench Business . Committee on the strength of the petition. The Bury MP said he would . defy any attempt by Mr Cameron to silence him. ‘I will vote in favour of . a referendum. It is time the people had their say.’ Last night, despite the growing calls . for a referendum, Foreign Secretary William Hague insisted the . Government would not grant a public vote on leaving the EU altogether – . but said he would consider putting any future erosion of sovereignty to . the people. ‘The EU does have too much power, in . our view,’ he said. ‘But this is a Coalition Government. We have an . agreed programme on which the Lib Dems gave a lot of ground. ‘Any large-scale change in the treaties is for future years. Our place is in the European Union.’ Since Britain joined the Common . Market, there have been a series of Commons votes on whether there . should be referendums on EU treaties such as Maastricht and Lisbon – . although none on whether we should remain in the EU. All have been . defeated, largely due to Governments ordering MPs to vote them down. The Government has suffered three . defeats as a result of debates ordered by the Backbench Business . Committee, including rejecting a European bid to give prisoners the . vote.","Vote will be held in the Commons before Christmas .

"Louis van Gaal gave an intriguing insight into his infamous management style during an animated morning at Holland's pre-World Cup training camp. The 62-year-old Dutchman is set to be named as David Moyes's permanent replacement at Manchester United next week but is busy preparing his Holland squad for the summer showpiece in Brazil. While many of his country's stars - such as United striker Robin van Persie - are still involved in club action across Europe, Van Gaal is working with players from the Dutch league whose domestic season is already over. VIDEO Scroll down to watch van Gaal: Manchester United is the biggest club in the world . Hands on: Louis van Gaal gets to grips with Ajax midfielder Davy Klaassen in training on Wednesday . Forceful: The prospective Manchester United manager gives Klaassen vigorous instructions . Watch and learn: Terence Kongolo (centre) and Daryl Janmaat (right) watch as Klaasen gets his lesson . Focused: Van Gaal emerges for training on Thursday morning at the Dutch training camp . Holding court: The 62-year-old boss gives an animated talk to his squad in Hoenderloo . One player who got a hands-on experience of Van Gaal's style was Ajax midfielder Davy Klaassen, who was pictured having his arm grabbed during a particularly animated discussion. Feyenoord defenders Terence Kongolo and Daryl Janmaat watched on as Klaassen was dragged, literally, in the direction Van Gaal wanted. While Ryan Giggs may be many fans' choice to take the hot seat at Old Trafford due to his links with United's glorious past, Van Gaal will not shy away from sweeping away any deadwood and imposing his own, distinct style on the squad. That approach has left a sour taste at several of his previous clubs, including Barcelona and Bayern Munich. In addition, many big names have admitted becoming disillusioned with his attitude, notably Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who branded him a 'dictator with no sense of humour'. Attention: Karim Rekik, Georginio Wijnaldum and Daley Blind listen as Van Gaal barks out more orders . Hard yards: Jean Paul Boetius, Terence Kongolo, Georginio Wijnaldum, Davy Klassen are on the left side of their coaches (front to back) with Daley Blind, Jasper Cillessen, Daryl Janmaat and Kenneth Vermeer on the right . Hands up: Van Gaal speaks animatedly to his players (left) and makes another forceful point (right) But with spots in his World Cup squad up for grabs, the Dutch youngsters were in no position to argue and listened intently to Van Gaal's instructions. Daley Blind, the Ajax left back and son of Van Gaal's assistant, Danny Blind, was among the players listening in as their boss barked orders at the training camp in Hoenderloo. Another one of the Holland assistant coaches Patrick Kluivert, who could also team up with his boss at United was also in attendance, along with Blind Snr. Gather round: The Dutch squad obediently listen to their ringleader deliver his instructions . Stony faced: Van Gaal shows off his notoriously stern manner during training in Hoenderloo . Van Gaal has revealed he would love to be the next manager of United and will be unveiled once he and the club have agreed the make-up of his coaching staff. The former Ajax boss is still talking to other clubs but told BBC Sport: ‘I would love the (United) job. For every coach who takes the job it’s a fantastic challenge. ‘I hope I shall be the one but you’ll have to wait and see. There are more clubs interested. I have more options. It is a process we’re in and everybody has to wait patiently on my choice and that of the clubs. ‘But United are the biggest club in the world’. Lighter moment; The Holland boss shares a joke with his assistants Patrick Kluivert and Frans Hoek (right) Serious moment: The former Ajax and Barcelona boss looks stern for a moment . United have agreed most of the details with Van Gaal but want to announce his appointment, and the composition of his coaching staff, all at the same time, rather than have a drip-feed of information as was the case when Moyes took the job last year. United also have to be sensitive to the needs and demands of the Dutch FA. Holland have a World Cup to prepare for under Van Gaal and understandably do not want their preparations disrupted by the publicity surrounding their coach’s future beyond Brazil 2014.","Louis van Gaal is taking a Holland training camp this week .

"Friendly chatter among colleagues can easily become chatter among, well,everyone when news reporters forget to turn off their microphones after reporting live. That's what happened in the California KTLA 5 news room Friday when traffic presenter Ginger Chan forgot to turn off her microphone thus declaring to the newsroom -- and everyone listening -- that her colleague Sam Rubin is fat. Scroll down for video . Embarrassed: KTLA 5 reporter Ginger Chan looks shocked in embarassment after she realizes she forgot to turn off her microphone before calling news anchor, Sam Rubin, fat . News room: The newsroom erupted in laughter, inluding Rubin, leading Chan to recognize her mistake, she then frantically turned off her microphone . Rubin, was sharing a story with colleagues on air about a time his wife asked him 'when did you become the fat guy on that show?' referring to his participation in the KTLA 5 morning news. In a moment that took everyone by surprise, Chan replied, from another room, 'he's always been!' The newsroom erupted in laughter leading Chan to recognize her mistake.

Chan's jab seemed to be a funny joke as Rubin laughed along with his colleagues. The station also didn't think too deeply into the incident. In a post on the station's Facebook page, station officials wrote 'Accidents happen, and that’s why our anchors are supposed to turn off their microphones when not on camera...Sorry, Sam Rubin. We think you look great.' Rubin was a good sport as well, in a post on his Facebook page, he described the incident as a 'very honest; and very funny moment.' He also wrote that he did not mind that Chan's joke was at his expense. I guess the dissing and banter is all in good fun at the KTLA news room. However, this isn't the only incident where KTLA 5 was in the public eye for something other than reporting. In February, Rubin himself was the one embarrassed when he mistook actor Samuel L. Jackson for Laurence Fishburne during a live interiew.

"A skateboarder was assaulted when he came to the aid of two Muslim women who were being verbally abused. The 26-year old woman was driving her mother in Newcastle, NSW, when a member of the public approached her vehicle. What happened next caught the attention of Patrick Burgess, 24, who was in Newcastle to visit his friends. Patrick Burgess, 24, tried to defuse the hostile situation between a member of the public and two woman driving in Newcastle, NSW . A street view of Smith St, where a 27-year old man berated a Muslim mother and daughter in their car on Monday night . ‘We were skateboarding on obstacles that we brought to the netball courts on high street in Newcastle west,’ he said. ‘It was unclear from where we were, but it sounded like he was screaming miscellaneous racial abuse at them.’ Things quickly turned hostile when Mr Burgess defended the woman and her mother. ‘As soon as we said something the man turned to us. He was clearly very aggressive. We tried to diffuse the situation but to no avail.’ Police claim the man threatened to kill Mr Burgess and his friends, then allegedly stole two of their mobile phones and ran down the street. Mr Burgess, who works as an engineer, says people should be more willing to step in if they witness similar incidents . ‘The guy attempted to attack us several times before he assaulted me, at which stage I had to physically protect myself,’ he said . Afterwards, Mr Burgess consoled the women and waited for police to arrive before offering statements. The incident is the latest anti-Muslim crime in Australia following a series of terror raids and comes days after the Abbott Government declared war on the Islamic State. Despite this, Mr Burgess said he would not hesitate to help if he witnessed a similar incident. ‘We could see that there was an issue and it was clear they needed help. There were several cars driving past throughout the event, none of which stopped to see what was going on,’ he said. Mr Burgess, who works as an engineer, said the public are too reluctant to step in when they witness people being persecuted. ‘The indifference of good people largely allows events like this to occur. If extremists like this man knew that the public would stand up and take action, they would be far less inclined to do so,’ he said. Mr Burgess (pictured) says he and his friends ‘were skateboarding on obstacles' when they saw the 27-year-old man abusing the Muslim daughter and mother . Mr Burgess said he would not hesitate to help if he witnessed a similar incident, and that ‘the indifference of good people largely allows events like this to occur' Mr Burgess said he drew a clear line in the sand with the recent spate of racial attacks in Australia. ‘It's absolutely appalling. No one deserves to be treated like those women were treated. They were innocently driving past and were attacked for no reason at all. How can that be justifiable?, he said. ‘I strongly believe that the people who are committing these crimes are a small minority of extremists who unfortunately attract the majority of media attention (similar the Islamic State). ‘It’s up to the greater public to start actively condemning these actions, looking out for one another, and talking about this issue to hopefully influence a greater understanding of what is going on, rather than just ignoring it and allowing it to perpetuate.’ The suspect was later arrested a short distance away and was taken to Newcastle Police Station where he was charged with intimidation,assault, larceny  and malicious damage.","A 27-year old man berated a Muslim mother and daughter in their car on Monday night .

"Security chiefs are holding emergency talks over the terror threat to Parliament and other major landmarks following the lone-wolf gun attack in Canada, David Cameron revealed today. The heads of MI5 and Scotland Yard met this morning to review 'the security of institutions in central London', the Prime Minister said. It came after a gunman rampaged through Canada's parliament in Ottawa before being shot dead by the heroic sergeant at arms Kevin Vickers. David Cameron said Britons needed to remain in a state of 'permanent vigilance' Muslim convert named Michael Zehaf-Bibeau shot and killed a soldier at the city's war memorial before launching his attack on the parliament. Mr Cameron today urged the British public to maintain 'permanent vigilance' in the face of the global terror threat. But he said: 'Meetings are taking place to ensure we have all the angles covered.' Mr Cameron, speaking to the BBC's Asian Network, said: 'I was in a meeting with the Metropolitan Police commissioner and the head of MI5 when the news about Ottawa broke. 'They immediately reassured me that they had been looking at the security of institutions in central London but they would look again to see if there was more that can be done. 'Those meetings are this morning. But from every- thing I see I know we are taking steps across the board to meet the threats we face as a country.' Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers was applauded in the House of Commons in Ottawa today . Mr Vickers, gun in hand, walked through Parliament moments after shooting . assailant Michael Zehaf-Bibeau . Canadian police cleared the area at the entrance of Parliament hill in Ottawa yesterday while the Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper was rushed away from the attack . He said the outrage in Ottawa 'shows that we have to be permanently vigilant against this sort of terrorist threat'. The UK's terror threat level was raised from 'substantial' to 'severe' — meaning an attack is highly likely — in late August amid fears of a terrorist strike linked to Islamic State or another extremist group. Parliament's joint security committee will meet shortly. Its chairman Greg Hands told the Standard: 'I'm sure Canada and what happened there will feature in our discussions. 'It's no secret the Canadian Parliament and UK Parliament are two of the most similar legislatures, both in operation and physical building.' Guidance to people working at Westminster on what to do if gunmen get into one of the buildings may also be updated and re-sent. Commons authorities have previously advised that if there is a terror attack on Parliament people should try to get fully away rather than hide in offices. Commons Leader William Hague told MPs he is to send a message of solidarity from the British Parliament to Canada. Labour leader Ed Miliband also said in a speech at Rochester, Kent: 'We stand in solidarity with the Canadian people.' Security chiefs are concerned that the Houses of Parliament in London will be the target of a copycat attack . In Canada, the country's MPs today hailed sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers after his swift actions put a stop to the attacker's hail of gunfire. Mr Vickers, a 58-year-old former Canadian Mountie, shot the assailant. Vickers has been the House of Commons' head of security since 2005 and will now go down in history as one of its most memorable after he bravely pursued and took down Zehaf-Bibeau. Despite working for the police for three decades, relatives said the incident was the first time in his career that Vickers had ever shot anyone. Riveting video taken inside Ottawa's House of Commons makes startlingly real just how heart-thumpingly dangerous the situation was that Vickers heroically diffused. A rush of armed police can be seen running toward an unseen suspect as the video from Globe and Mail opens. At the head of the pack is a man moving swiftly with his gun in hand toward Zehaf-Bibeau, who had moments before murdered a reservist who stood guard at Canada's Tomb of the Unknown soldier. The death of that man, a 24-year-old father of a young son, Nathan Cirillo, would soon be avenged as Vickers takes aim inside the cavernous parliamentary building and fires off multiple shots. As those shots echo throughout the hall, the video goes wobbly as the men behind their leader Vickers move for cover. 'MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms,' tweeted New Democrat MP Craig Scott.","Security chiefs held talks over the terror threat to Parliament, PM reveals .

"A new report claims that actor Stephen Collins will not be prosecuted in molestation cases involving underage victims that are currently being looked into by the New York Police Department, Los Angeles Police Department and Los Angeles Sheriff's Department. TMZ reports that they have spoken to law enforcement sources who say 'the cases will go nowhere.' This, despite audio obtained by the site from 2012 that has the actor allegedly confessing to molesting underage girls. Scroll down for video . Getting off: Stephen Collins (above) may not be charged for allegedly molesting three underage girls according to law enforcement sources . Recorded: The scandal first erupted when recording made by Collins' wife Faye Grant (above) allegedly had the actor admitting to molesting underage girls . The audio was taped by Collins' estranged wife, Faye Grant, during a therapy session and without his knowledge. The problem apparently is that since the three cases in question as decades old, prosecutors will be barred by the statute of limitations. Speaking with US Weekly this Wednesday, the LAPD say they are still very much investigating whether or not Collins molested an underage female neighbor. 'Special Victims Bureau detectives are working with New York Police Department authorities on this case,' they told the magazine. 'There is no further information at this time. The investigation is active and ongoing.' Missing out: Collins was fired from the film Ted 2 and the ABC show Scandal after the news broke . Grant has also claimed her estranged husband molested a girl in California during the time he appear on the show 7th Heaven, sometime between 1996 and 2007, but it appears no victim has come forward. The case in New York may still have a shot however, as the victim came forward in 2012. That being said, the incident happened sometime in the 70s and TMZ is reporting 'law enforcement has all but given up on a viable case.' The NYPD has yet to respond to requests for comment. And while Collins has yet to be charged with any crimes, the allegations have had a major impact on his career, with the actor being dropped from the hit ABC show Scandal as well as the film Ted 2, which he was set to start filming just days after this story first broke.","A new report claims that law enforcement sources feel that actor Stephen Collins will not be charged for allegedly molesting underage victims .

"Archaeologists are set to excavate the buried remains of a sixth century chapel - which could be Britain's oldest place of Christian worship. St Piran's Oratory near Perranporth, Cornwall, has been encased in a concrete bunker for decades to protect it from the elements. But experts have finally been granted permission to remove the casing so they can begin excavating and preserving the medieval site. St Piran's Oratory is pictured in its protective shell in 1955. James Gossip, an archaeologist at Cornwall Council, said: 'This is a very important site and it will be amazing to see what is under the sand' Saint Piran was an early 6th-century Cornish abbot and saint from Ireland. He is the patron saint of tin-miners and the patron saint of Cornwall. Legend has it that the heathen Irish tied him to a mill-stone, rolled it over the edge of a cliff into a tempestuous sea, which suddenly became calm. He then floated safely over the sea to land upon the sandy beach of Perranzabuloe in Cornwall. He was joined at Perranzabuloe by many of his Christian converts and together they founded the Abbey of Lanpiran, with Piran as abbot. Saint Piran 'rediscovered' tin-smelting - tin had been smelted in Cornwall since before the Romans' arrival, but the methods had since been forgotten - when his black hearthstone, a slab of tin-bearing ore, had the tin smelt out of it and rise to the top in the form of a white cross. This white cross then came to be the symbol of Cornwall. According to legend, St Piran, the patron saint of tinners, built the chapel and forged a white cross in a fire which went on to become the symbol of Cornwall. Engulfed by sand in the Middle Ages, the remains of the oratory were first discovered in the late 18th Century. There were two major digs in 1835 and 1843 that uncovered a number of skeletons - including one of large, headless man. However, the remains were buried and encased in a large bunker in 1910 to protect them.

"Jane Fallon, novelist, producer of the BBC's brilliant This Life and long-term girlfriend of Ricky Gervais, has written a new book, Skeletons. It's funny and clever, a perfectly paced page-turner that delves into family dynamics and manipulation. We sit in the corner of a London club for tea. She's skinny but not slight, wearing a T-shirt with a faded Batman emblem and a tweedy jacket. She has huge inviting eyes and great skin, and looks nothing like her 53 years. Because of the complicated people she writes about I was expecting someone more cranky, but she says none of the book is drawn from her personal family experience. Being the girlfriend of an international celebrity has kept Jane determined to succeed on her own . Jane was one of five children - did she really not draw on that? 'Everyone has bits of dysfunction in their families, but I actually have a very nice, happy one,' she says. 'I'm slightly obsessed with other people's families. If you delve you always find something. People always say, ""My family is so normal"", and when you poke into them they never are. I'm interested in the horrible things people do to others.' I want to know if any of these horrible things have happened to her and Ricky. 'We've been very happy for a long time,' she says. 'We're very lucky.' They met at University College London in 1982 and knew straight away they were the ones for each other. Jane with Ricky at the Emmys in 2009 . 'Pretty much, yes,' she says. 'But it's not like we met and said, ""Let's settle down and stay together forever."" We met when I was in my third year, he was in his second. We're the same age, but he took a year out and I didn't.' They haven't married. 'It's never been important to either of us. If one of us had wanted to do it, the other one would have said, ""Yes"".' Of course, Ricky's career has taken off since The Office in 2001, so I ask if she found it annoying that before her success as a novelist (she was a script editor and producer at the BBC) people thought of her as Ricky's girlfriend. 'I still am thought of as that by most people, just not by people who read novels.' Is that suffocating? 'Not really. I always had my TV career and I always knew I'd do something else. It can be grim but it made me think I need to do my own thing. It's that being-one-of-five thing. Stand up and be counted. It fuels my desire to keep doing something.' Ricky hasn't read any of her books, she says. In fact, 'he's only read one novel, The Catcher In The Rye. One of his best friends persuaded him if he was only ever going to read one book it should be that one. He read it, he said it was an amazing experience and he could never top it, so he didn't want to read another one.' Jane was born in Harrow in north-west London but when she was small she moved to Buckinghamshire, where her parents had a newsagent's shop. 'They'd get up at 4.30am, seven days a week. I inherited a real work ethic from them but I left college with no idea what to do. My dad used to cut out newspaper ads and post them to me in the hope I'd get a proper job. HBO toyed with the idea of creating an on screen version of Jane's novel Foursome (left) 'One of them was for what they used to call a Girl Friday, a runner for a theatrical agency. It was perfect. A tiny place with posters on the walls. Actors, actresses, scripts everywhere. I fell in love with it. When I left I became a freelance script reader and then a script editor for TV, but you just get bored of the process. There's something lovely about writing a book, doing what you want. I love the solitariness of it. It's my natural state of mind.' Her novels have attracted Hollywood A-listers wanting to option the rights. 'Jennifer Aniston bought an option on the first, Getting Rid Of Matthew. I would have loved her to do it but the option ran out. HBO toyed with the third one, Foursome, for a while. All of them have been through various processes.' She shrugs calmly, and there's a mesmerising stability to her. Who wouldn't be frustrated that Jennifer Aniston nearly filmed your book? 'I'm not good with insecurity. I like things to be open and calm. If not, I'm too much of a worrier.' In Skeletons the main character, Jen, works on a hotel reception desk, a job that's showy but not very demanding. Jane, however, says she was always ambitious. 'From a young age I wanted to do . something important. Jen aspires to an ordinary life in family terms, . and I've never done that. You know how girls play with dolls, saying, ""I . want to get married and have babies""? I was never like that. I've . always put my lack of wanting children down to the fact I come from a . big family. I wanted to do something that made me stand out. 'When . people reach their thirties they think, ""Quick, get on with it."" It's . like they're overcome physically with need. Maybe it's a biological . thing. It just didn't happen to me. I love kids, I have lots of nieces . and nephews, but I never felt the need to have my own. You shouldn't . have a child unless you feel you're going to be a good parent.' Does she have friends whose children . have gone off to college like Jen's in the book? 'No but I do have . friends who worry they'll not be involved in their children's lives any . more. I think if you have no kids you don't have those marked moments . and the relationship evolves slowly, not with a big event that makes you . think, ""What are we going to do now?"" We're used to it being just the . two of us, so we evolve without realising.' Jane and Ricky have been together for 32 years after meeting at University in 1982 . She and Ricky have a house in London's upmarket Hampstead and an apartment in New York, which they use fitting around his schedules. He's currently working on Night At The Museum 3 so she'll go to accompany him. 'If Ricky's away for months, I go back and forth. We like to be together, otherwise what's the point? You've chosen to be with this person. It's too hard to be apart. We prefer to be together if we can.' She's already halfway through her next book - about a woman who tries to get her assistant to honey-trap someone she suspects is being un-faithful. I wonder if that's borne out of her insecurity that Ricky's cheating on her? 'No,' she laughs. And we agree that he's the least honey-trappable person on the planet. But she admits, 'I'm not good with insecurity. I like things to be open and calm. If not, I'm too much of a worrier.'

"Salman Butt and Mohammad Asif have been convicted of match-fixing in the scandal that rocked cricket. They both now face up to seven years in prison when they are sentenced on Thursday after being found guilty of conspiracy to cheat and accept corrupt payments. After deliberating for nearly 17 hours, the jury convicted the pair at London's Southwark Crown Court. And it can now be revealed that Mohammad Aamer has already pleaded guilty to both charges. This detail was not previously reported because of court restrictions. Good riddance: Butt waves before discovering his verdict . Sally Walsh, senior lawyer in the Crown Prosecution Service's special crime and counter-terrorism division, said: 'Salman Butt, Mohammad Aamer and Mohammad Asif deliberately and knowingly perverted the course of a cricket match for financial gain. 'Through their actions they brought shame on the cricketing world, jeopardising the faith and admiration of cricket fans the world over. 'This prosecution shows that match fixing is not just unsportsmanlike but is a serious criminal act. 'The actions of these top international players went against everything expected of someone in their position and they failed to take into account their fans of all ages and nationalities when deciding to abandon the values of sportsmanship so unconditionally. 'The prosecution said that Butt, Aamer, and Asif conspired together, in August 2010, to accept money as an inducement or reward for the giving of advance information about the bowling of no-balls in the Lord's Test match by Asif and Aamer. 'The court was told that these charges related to the bowling of no-balls on August 26 and 27 2010, during Pakistan's fourth Test at Lord's Cricket Ground in London. 'People who had paid good money to see a professional and exciting game of cricket on the famous ground at Lord's had no idea that what they were watching was not a true game but one where part of the game had been pre-determined for cash. 'Butt and Asif denied any wrongdoing but the jury has decided after hearing all the evidence that what happened on the crease that day was criminal in the true sense of the word.' The pair did not react to the first verdicts, sitting expressionless in the dock. Asif returned to the court in the afternoon to be found guilty of the charge of accepting corrupt payments. Butt was found guilty as his wife Gul Hassan gave birth to their second son after undergoing a Caesarean section in hospital in Pakistan. Former Test captain Butt, 27, and . fast bowler Asif, 28, plotted to bowl deliberate no-balls in last . summer's Lord's Test against England. The pair were caught after an undercover reporter recorded UK-based sports agent Mazhar Majeed, 36, boasting how he could arrange for Pakistan cricketers to rig games for money. Majeed claimed he had been carrying out match-fixing for two-and-a-half years and had made 'masses and masses of money'. He . spoke of the advantages of 'grooming' younger cricketers to work with . him and bragged that he had seven players in Pakistan's national side . rigging games for him. The . corrupt agent also discussed deliberately losing the Oval Test match . against England last summer for more than a million dollars and plotted . to fix games at last year's Twenty20 World Cup in the West Indies. The . fixing scandal emerged after the News of the World's investigations . editor Mazher Mahmood approached Majeed in August last year pretending . to be a wealthy Indian businessman seeking major international . cricketers for a tournament. The agent was secretly filmed accepting £150,000 in cash from the journalist as part of an arrangement to rig games. Majeed . promised the reporter that Asif and fellow fast bowler Aamer, 19, would . deliver three no-balls at specific points during the Lord's Test . between Pakistan and England from August 26 to 29 last year. Guilty: Asif faces the waiting media at Southwark Crown Court . The no-balls were bowled exactly as . promised. The probability of someone predicting this by chance was . estimated by a cricket statistician as 1.5 million to one. Butt and Asif both strenuously denied any involvement in match-fixing.Explaining . why he bowled a no-ball at Lord's precisely when Majeed said he would, . Asif claimed that Butt told him ""run faster, f***er"" moments before his . delivery. The former . Pakistan captain said the agent asked him to rig parts of crunch games . at the 2010 Twenty20 World Cup and last summer's Test series against . England. He insisted he . ignored the requests, but admitted he did not fulfil his duty to inform . the cricketing authorities about the corrupt approach. Blatant: Mohammad Aamer bowled obvious no balls at Lord's . The jury was not told that Aamer pleaded . guilty to conspiracy to cheat and conspiracy to accept corrupt payments . at a pre-trial hearing on September 16. Aamer, a teenage cricketing sensation who was tipped to become one of the all-time great fast bowlers, issued a heartfelt apology for his actions through his lawyer when he pleaded guilty. His barrister, Ben Emmerson QC, told the court: 'Aamer wants to make it clear he wants to take full responsibility for what he did by deliberately bowling two no-balls. 'This vulnerable 18-year-old boy, as he . was then, was subjected to extreme pressure from those upon whom he . should have been able to rely. Guilty: Asif (left) and Butt together at Trent Bridge in 2010 . 'He recognises the damage he has caused Pakistan cricket and he wishes to do his best to put that right.' The jury was also not told that the International Cricket Council imposed long suspensions on the three Pakistan cricketers in February. Butt was banned for 10 years, five of them suspended, Asif for seven years, two of them suspended, and Aamer was banned for five years. They are all appealing against the bans. The officer in charge of the case, Detective Chief Superintendent Matthew Horne, of the Metropolitan Police, paid tribute to the News of the World for the investigation which sparked the charges. He said: 'You have to give credit to the investigative journalism. I recognised there was a case to build on top of it. It's fair to say we wouldn't be here without their investigative journalism that started it.' Sting: News of the World cover . Reacting to the outcome of the trial, sports minister Hugh Robertson said: 'This is a sad day for international cricket and sport in general. The integrity of sport is absolutely paramount. Fans have to be sure that what they see in front of them is true and fair. 'There needs to be a global effort on sports betting integrity and this is something that the International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge has taken a lead on, heading up a high-level working group that I sit on. 'International sports bodies and governments need to work together and do everything possible to stamp out the threat of corruption in sport.' Yawar Saeed was Pakistan's team manager last summer, when the corruption was first alleged. The 76-year-old said the players had failed to heed his warnings about outside influences. Saeed told Cricinfo: 'It is a very . disappointing and sad day for us in one way, for the players and for . Pakistan cricket to be caught up in criminal proceedings. 'But . they did something wrong and they had to pay the price for it. As . manager, I had spoken to all the players on that tour and had talked . about focusing on cricket and keeping their eye on the ball, but in the . case of some, they didn't. 'I . think the impact of the entire incident has already been felt months . ago, when the case first came up, when the players were banned by the . ICC. What is required now is to forget everything and move ahead. 'These . things have happened in the past and the game has moved on. India had . its own case and banned its players. The biggest jolt has already . happened for Pakistan cricket and it could not get worse. 'But . we have recovered from this and the team is doing well, I don't think . the verdict will hurt the team now, there is no shortage of talent in . Pakistan.' Saeed stressed the players who have come into the Pakistan team have ensured the convicted trio are not being missed. He . said: 'We had good players who could replace the players involved in . this case and they have done so. We just want the team to keep doing . well now.'","Pair face seven years in prison after damning court verdicts .

"Australia and New Zealand cricket officials say their national teams will likely to meet in the world's first day-night Test match in November next year, either at Hobart or Adelaide. James Sutherland, Cricket Australia chief, and his New Zealand Cricket counterpart David White said that talks in Melbourne last week advanced plans for the match and both countries 'are supportive of the innovation and its clear benefits.' New Zealand are scheduled to tour Australia from late 2015 and Sutherland said the venue for the historic match had been narrowed down to the Adelaide Oval or Hobart's Blundstone Arena. Play would likely begin at 2 pm each day and a pink ball will be used. Historic: The Adelaide Oval is one of two venues being considered by Cricket Australia for a day-night Test . Setting: The Bellerive Oval in Hobart could host the day-night Test between Australia and New Zealand . 'We are serious about pushing ahead with the concept of day-night Test cricket,' Sutherland said. 'We feel it will only strengthen the position and possibilities for test cricket in many parts of the world,' he added. 'There are many test matches played during non-holiday periods when adults are at work and kids are at school. That's not an ideal way to promote the highest form of the game.' Sutherland said there was no intention of shifting Australia's marquee Boxing Day or New Year Test matches to a day-night format 'given they are staged at the peak of holiday season,' but matches in non-holiday periods would be considered. New ground: New Zealand, pictured on their 2011 tour of Australia, will be the opposition if plans go ahead . A pink ball would be used for a day-night Test . He said data showed annual Tests at . Perth, Western Australia, which ends at around 9 pm Australian east . coast time each day, rated 40 per cent higher than other matches played . at the same time of year. 'We believe that's evidence in itself that we'll get greater viewership and more opportunities for people to attend,' Sutherland said. He accepted cricket traditionalists might not support day-night Test matches, but believed the commercial and other benefits outweighed reservations about tradition. 'I don't think we're ever going to get to a stage where everyone is completely satisfied or comfortable with it,' Sutherland said. 'But I think if we go back 30-odd years in time when the first-ever day-night one-day internationals were played, I'm sure there was that same level of trepidation among some stakeholders including players about things like day-night cricket and white ball,' he said. White said tradition was not in itself an excuse to reject innovation. 'People have talked about messing with . the traditions of Test cricket,' he said. 'But since it was first played . in (1877) there's been significant changes - covered pitches, fielding . restrictions, over limits, introduction of helmets, change in the . no-ball law etc. Tradition: The annual MCG Boxing Day Test and SCG New Year Test are not being considered for the plans . Audience: Test matches in Perth finish around 9pm on the Australian east coast and attract many viewers . 'I think as administrators we must keep evolving and improving the game for our stakeholders. We need to be mindful of change, but keep an open mind on these things.' Sutherland said trials would continue to develop a pink ball, which closely mirrors the performance of the red ball currently used in test cricket. Trials had already been carried out in Australia's domestic Sheffield Shield competition and those would likely continue in Australia and New Zealand this year. He said consultation will also continue with both nations' players' associations, the ICC, fans and broadcasters.","Historic Test will take place in either Adelaide or Hobart .

And he took his haphazard approach to defending to a new extreme at Liverpool's Melwood training complex when he clumsily floored Sturridge but luckily the England international was not hurt and recovered to see the funny side of the challenge.

Moment of truth: The striker looked in some discomfort after the clumsy tackle by defender Sakho . Off the hook: Luckily for Liverpool and England, Sturridge emerged unscathed and laughed of the incident . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers . seemed in good spirits ahead of the final game of a season which has . seen him re-establish the Reds as a Champions League team and emerge as . unlikely challengers for the Premier League title. In . his pre-match press conference on Friday, Rodgers said it was important . not to dwell on the points Liverpool have dropped in their last two . games against Palace and Chelsea, but to look forward and aim to imporve . on mistakes. 'It has been excellent,' he said. 'You could see the emotion after the game and that was pretty much the same in the dressing room afterwards. 'But we know the areas we need to improve. 'We . won't dwell on it. You can't think about what might or could have . happened, you can only really focus on what has happened and look . forward to getting better and improving.' Happy days: Manager Brendan Rodgers and his players look in good spirits at the club's Melwood complex . Rodgers . also insisted that defensively his side have not been good enough this . season and highlighted that as a feature of their play he is keen to improve on in . time for next season. He said: 'I've watched it (the Palace match) three times since and I'm still in shock when I see us end up drawing the game 3-3. 'To . have that much control and good concentration and organisation in the . game, for it to slip with 12 minutes to go shouldn't happen. 'If . you can't keep your concentration long enough, you'll lose your place. It's as simple as that - you'll lose your place in the squad. 'We've . played in big games this season and showed real solidity defensively - . but we went away to Cardiff and yes, we scored six goals, but we . conceded three; went away to Stoke, scored five and conceded three; . Palace three; Hull three. 'Yes, . there's an element of quality from the opponent, but I look at and . analyse the games intensely and a big part of it is concentration - . organisation, concentrating on your job. 'But our work is continual. We will really focus on that part of our game over the course of pre-season. 'Like . I said when I came in, we had to improve our goals tally, so we went . from 47 scored in a season (2011-12) to now 99 and whatever it finishes . at this weekend - and we'll do the same with the defence.'

"Rosamund Pike, pictured at a press conference for Gone Girl, says that seeing the character on screen ‘was hard even for me – and I’d played the role' The film is a dark blend of betrayal, gore and suspense – and its leading character a chilling femme fatale riven by jealousy and loathing. So it is perhaps not surprising that five gruelling weeks spent playing psychotic Amy Elliott-Dunne in the hit thriller Gone Girl left British actress Rosamund Pike traumatised and physically drained. But the instant the cameras stopped rolling, Rosamund, 35, made a momentous decision – she knew she wanted to have a baby... straight away. ‘After filming I just knew I had to go out there and make a human being,’ says the Oxford- educated actress, patting her bump beneath her loose-fitting white Christian Dior dress. ‘The film was so tough and such a hard experience that the instant I’d finished I thought, “I need to bring something positive into the world. Life is good with little people around.” ’ Rosamund, who already has a two-year-old son called Solo with her partner, London businessman Robie Uniacke, is now seven months' pregnant with her second child. But the happy domesticity she now radiates could hardly be in greater contrast to Gone Girl’s Amy, who is at war with her cheating husband. Indeed, with the birth of her new child just weeks away, Rosamund found it disturbing watching the film at last month’s premiere in New York. Gone Girl, based on Gillian Flynn’s addictive bestseller of the same name, is the tale of a marital meltdown in which Amy goes missing on her fifth wedding anniversary, leaving behind a scene that suggests her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) has harmed her. What starts out as psychological warfare descends into a gory bloodbath. ‘Seeing it on screen was hard even for me – and I’d played the role,’ says Rosamund in an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday. ‘As a pregnant woman I felt so far away from that narcissistic woman. ‘It’s the sort of part that does make you look at yourself and wonder where the movie role ends and the real self begins. ‘I thought, “I’d better make sure this is all buried away. I don’t want to release any of this when I get home.” The role was tough because there are scenes of great violence in the film – physical and psychological. The script just gets into your veins, as though someone is injecting toxins into you.’ Luckily, Robie, 53, and Solo were able to join her while the film was being made, providing some much-needed distraction. ‘If you have a little boy, you walk through the door at home and you get on to the floor with some Lego – that’s a wonderful antidote,’ Rosamund reveals. Scroll down for video . ‘If that didn’t work, I’d play ping-pong, which is a great way of getting things out of your head.’ While her blossoming career may mean moving to America from London full-time, the actress is determined that neither of her children will become Hollywood brats. ‘I look at all of the kids who are wearing T-shirts saying “Little Princess” or “I’m The Boss” or “I’m Too Cute” or “My Mommy Thinks I’m Hot” or whatever, and they’re encouraged in school to sing songs about why they are special, and it’s just got out of hand. 'It’s really prevalent – expectations are sky-high for kids these days.’ Though clearly a doting mother, Rosamund, pictured here with her partner, London businessman Robie Uniacke with their son Solo, two, she takes her career seriously which has been more steady than stellar . She adds: ‘I think we are living in a narcissism epidemic. We’re encouraged to share our lives in a way that is presented as fun. 'But what it really means is that we end up editing them – we want to make it seem that we are more enviable, and having a better time, and going to more amazing parties than all our friends are. ‘If you watch people taking photographs of each other now, you see that everyone is aware of the cameras in the room and everyone is aware of how they want to be seen, and immediately thinks, “Quick, change my expression, I don’t want to make that face for the camera.” Rosamund, pictured here with Ben Affleck in a scene from Gone Girl in which she played a dark role, said after a tough day of filming she would wind down by playing with her son Solo. 'If you have a little boy, you walk through the door at home and you get on to the floor with some Lego – that’s a wonderful antidote’ ‘But if you look at old albums from your parents’ or grandparents’ generation, there’s an amazing candour in people’s faces you just don’t get these days.’ Though clearly a doting mother, there is no doubt how seriously Rosamund takes her career. To date, however, her track record has been more steady than stellar. Although she played supporting roles in a number of Hollywood films, a big breakthrough role had proved elusive ... until now. She discovered from Gone Girl director David Fincher that she had been cast while filming in the Scottish Highlands. Rosamund, pictured in merry spirits after a night out at a function in Downing Street this month, says she's been ready for tougher roles for years and says she was ready to 'get out of all the boxes I've been put into' ‘I’ve been ready for tougher roles for years,’ she insists. ‘I was ready to get out of all the boxes I’ve been put into ... for someone to call on me for the dark role. I felt as though I’d never been stretched. ‘Even though I’ve played a variety of roles I’m still seen in the same light: the reserved, cool one from Oxford. ‘When I first met David, he probably wanted to see whether I had the guts for the role, or whether I was some sort of precious little English flower who didn’t want to get my hands dirty – which, of course, wasn’t the case. ‘I’ve been fortunate enough to have had some lovely roles where I am not the main focus – now I was ready to do something like this.’","Leading character in the hit film is riven by traits of jealousy and loathing .

"A new cover for Roald Dahl’s beloved children’s book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was last night branded ‘creepy’ by critics. The Penguin Modern Classics edition - aimed at the adult market - is being released to mark the book’s 50th anniversary. But its cover, featuring a photograph of a heavily made up young girl wearing a feather boa and sitting on her mother’s knee with a doll-like expression, sparked an immediate backlash. Scroll down for video . The new cover for the 50th anniversary edition of the Roald Dahl classic Charlie and the Chocolate Factory . According to the publisher, the unsettling image reflects the way Dahl’s writing ‘manages to embrace both the light and the dark aspects of life’. But after the new cover was slated by critics after being unveiled yesterday on Penguin’s Facebook page. Best-selling Chocolat author Joanne Harris tweeted: ‘Seriously, Penguin Books. Why not just get Rolf Harris to design the next one? Is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's 50th anniversary edition cover 'over sexualised'? ‘I’m not sure why adults need a different cover anyway, but who was it who decided that ‘adult’ meant ‘inappropriately sexualised’?’ Giles Paley-Phillips, an award-winning children’s author, said: ‘I’m not liking the new cover for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, looks more Lolita!’ Fans of the book also commented on the picture on social media. ‘This is a beautiful book and the cover does absolutely no justice to it. Pretentious and trashy,’ was one comment. One of the previous version of the book, which features illustrations by the artist Sir Quentin Blake . Others called it ‘creepy’, ‘grotesque’, ‘misjudged on every level’ and ‘distasteful and disrespectful to a gifted author and his work’. It is 50 years since the book, by author Roald Dahl, pictured, was first published . One Dahl fan summed up the reaction: ‘Is there time for a reprint? You’re destroying my childhood.’ The tale tells the story of Charlie Bucket, a poor young boy who finds a golden ticket granting him entry to Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory. Charlie is a sweet hard-working boy but he discovers another world of spoilt children and indulgence inside the factory. Penguin said the girl in the cover photograph was not intended to be either Violet Beauregarde or Veruca Salt, the spoilt young girls who feature in Dahl’s tale, but a representation of the ‘twisted’ parent-child relationships depicted throughout the book. The cover photograph was taken from a French magazine fashion shoot by the photographers Sofia Sanchez and Mauro Mongiello, entitled Mommie Dearest. Many said they would refuse to buy the edition, claiming the image was reminiscent of US child beauty pageants and was more suited to Vladimir Nabokov’s Lolita or to Jacqueline Susann’s Valley of the Dolls. Penguin said: ‘This design is in recognition of the book’s extraordinary cultural impact and is one of the few children’s books to be featured in the Penguin Modern Classics list. ‘This new image for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory looks at the children at the centre of the story, and highlights the way Roald Dahl’s writing manages to embrace both the light and the dark aspects of life.’ The edition will be available from September 4.","New edition of the book is being released to appeal to the adult market .

"Bayern Munich are on the verge of launching a surprise move to sign Borussia Dortmund midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, reports in Germany are suggesting. The 23-year-old playmaker, who has been heavily linked with both Real Madrid and Manchester United this season, would be the third major Dortmund star in the last two years that Bayern had attempted to wrestle away from their rivals. Gundogan’s contract expires in the summer of 2015, and with a long-term back injury leaving his future form uncertain, Dortmund will certainly be considering cashing in on an estimated transfer fee of £25million this summer. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Gundogan scoring a sublime strike for Borussia Dortmund . Target: Bayern Munich have begun exploring the possibility of signing Borussia Dortmund's Ilkay Gundogan . Suitors: Manchester United and Real Madrid have been heavily linked with a move for Dortmund star Gundogan . Out of action: Injury has kept playmaker Gundogan on the sidelines since August . Spot on: Gundogan (second left) scores a penalty for Dortmund in last season's Champions League final . Real Madrid had previously been leading the race, with United also in the running, but according to German news magazine Focus, sounding-out talks have already begun at Bayern to investigate the possibility of the transfer. The news comes as a surprise, with Bayern having suggested only a few weeks ago that they were not looking to buy any more players from Dortmund. Major transfers such as those of Robert Lewandowski and Mario Gotze – as well as the failed bid to lure Marco Reus to Munich when he left Borussia Monchengladbach – had left the relationship between the two clubs sour, with everyone from the chief executive to the stadium announcer at BVB accusing Bayern of attempting to weaken their rivals through financial muscle alone. Waiting: Manchester United executive vice-chairman and manager David Moyes have earmarked Gundogan . International aspirations: Gundogan will be hoping to regain his place in the German team for the World Cup . Ammunition: United would hope the acquisition of Gundogan helps the likes of Robin van Persie score more goals . On Monday though, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge clarified that Dortmund players were 'not taboo' as transfer targets for Bayern. It would seem so, with Bayern now reportedly after Gundogan's signature. The midfielder, who has not played since sustaining a back injury in Germany's 3-3 draw against Paraguay last August, may be lined up as a direct, long-term replacement for Bastian Schweinsteiger. Madrid remains the most likely destination for Gundogan if he is to go, with a swap deal for Nuri Sahin a strong possibility. Squad improvements: Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola already has an incredibly talented squad . Controversy: Bayern have already ruffled Dortmund's feathers by lining up Robert Lewandowski for the summer . Previous: This follows on from Bayern buying Dortmund playmaker Mario Gotze last summer . High flyers: Real Madrid are reported to want Gundogan to be the midfield creativity for their forward talent . United, meanwhile, have also been linked with Gündogan. The Germany man would severely strengthen their midfield, and many are pointing to the similarities between this case and the transfer that saw United buy Shinji Kagawa from Dortmund two summers ago. Like Gündogan, Kagawa had a year remaining when Dortmund chose to offload him to United, and had also gone through a long-term injury while at the Westfalenstadion.","Ilkay Gundogan would be third Dortmund star in two years to join Bayern .

"World number one Serena Williams erased any concerns about her worrying left knee with a 6-4 6-4 win over Ana Ivanovic at the WTA Finals on Monday that featured two eye-popping demonstrations of her flexibility. Never one to do things by half, Williams provided a startling exhibition of just how much her troublesome knee has improved since she pulled out of two events in China. Williams' stellar performance in the match may have been helped on by recent negative comments from Russian Tennis Federation President Shamil Tarpischev, who called the number one ranked player and her sister Venus the 'Williams brothers' and 'scary to look at' during an appearance on a Russian TV show this month. At a press conference in Singapore on Sunday, the younger Williams sister thanks the Women's Tennis Association for its swift response to the comments, suspending Tarpischev for a year and ordering him to pay a $25,000 fine. Scroll down for video . Wow! Serena Williams showed off her remarkable flexibility as she beat Ana Ivanovic of Serbia during the opening round of the Women's Tennis Association championships in Singapore on Monday . Healthy again: A tricky left knee forced Williams to pull out of two events in China a few weeks ago . Winner, winner: Williams beat Ana Ivanovic (right) of Serbia in straight sets during Monday's game . About the comments, Williams said: 'I thought they were very insensitive and extremely sexist as well as racist at the same time. I thought they were in a way bullying.' On the court in Singapore on Monday, Williams was tentative to start but quickly got her stride. Midway through the first set, she sprinted so hard to try and chase down a forehand from Ivanovic that she ended up doing the splits. The crowd gasped in wonder as she bounced back up to her feet like an Olympic gymnast. Then she did the splits again in the second set, showing she has the elasticity to compliment her renowned power. 'I do work on my flexibility, but not for tennis, because I dance,' she later told a news conference. 'I guess it comes in handy. Like knocking two birds out with one stone.' Her acrobatic display was enough to alleviate any concerns about her prospects of winning the WTA's lucrative championship for a third straight year. Unacceptable: Williams recently called out Russian tennis coach Shamil Tarpischev (pictured) for his racist remarks against her and her sister Venus . 'Williams brothers': Tarpischev appeared on a Russian TV show and talked about how 'scary' the William sisters look, calling them the 'Williams brothers' instead. The tennis pro sisters pictured above playing doubles in April 2013 . A few weeks ago, her chances of winning looked slim after she first quit the Wuhan Open because of illness then the China Open with a knee complaint. The world number one only resumed training last week, restricting her practice to reduce any risk of aggravating the injury but showed no lingering effects against the lightning-fast Ivanovic, thumping down a dozen aces in her opening match. 'I didn't have any fear at all. I felt pretty good,' said Williams. 'I felt the knee a little bit, but compared to what it was in Beijing, it feels so much better. 'I'm getting better, which is great. Just have to keep doing my program so by the end of the week, hopefully - if I'm here - I'll still be getting better.' Number one: Williams was confident and happy at Monday's game in Singapore . If Williams had any health concerns after the match, it was with her voice, not her knee. After blowing a 4-1 lead in the opening set and allowing Ivanovic to get back to 4-4, her relief at taking the set was clearly visible. She clenched her fist and yelled 'C'mon' -- and repeated the gesture so many times before the end that she finished with a croaky throat. 'It's definitely all reflex. I never do it on purpose,' Williams said. 'I felt like my energy got a little low, and then I just tried to do everything I could to bring my energy level up or just to fight. 'Because if I'm not playing well, I have to rely on other things. So then I think at that point, that's when the match really turned and got super intense.'","The number one ranked played beat Ivanovic, of Serbia, 6-4 6-4 .

"Despite concerns, Rattigan did . receive a CBE in 1958 but was knighted only in 1971, four years after . homosexuality was eventually legalised . The plays of Sir Terence Rattigan are known as tirades against what he saw as the sexual hypocrisy of the British Establishment. Now newly released papers reveal his homosexuality nearly cost him a place on the Honours List and almost certainly delayed his knighthood. The word ‘homo’ was even written on documents concerning a recommendation that Rattigan – best known for The Winslow Boy and Separate Tables – be included on the Birthday Honours List of 1958. Newly released papers reveal Terence Rattigan's homosexuality nearly cost him a place on the Honours List and almost certainly delayed his knighthood . Despite the concerns, Rattigan did receive a CBE in 1958 but was knighted only in 1971, four years after homosexuality was eventually legalised. Pictured with his mother (left) at Buckingham Palace . His case was recorded as causing ‘difficulties!’ for civil servants and ‘divided views’ at a time when homosexuality was still illegal. Experts last night said it was unlikely the reference to ‘difficulties’ and ‘homo’ could refer to anything other than Rattigan’s private life. Geoffrey Wansell, of the Terence Rattigan Society, said: ‘I don’t see what other difficulties these people could have had in mind. He wasn’t brazen about his sexuality because it was against the law. 'But I don’t think there was any question in the minds of  people who knew him that he was gay.’ The papers, obtained by this newspaper under Freedom of Information laws, contain several redactions, and do not specify which honour Rattigan was being considered for. But the letters ‘CBE’ have been scribbled next to his name, implying that he may have initially been recommended for a knighthood but then downgraded. Despite the concerns, Rattigan did receive a CBE in 1958 but was knighted only in 1971, four years after homosexuality was eventually legalised. Sienna Miller (Patricia) and Sheridan Smith (Doris) in Flare Path by Rattigan . In any other circumstances, Rattigan, who was 46 in 1958, would appear to have been an obvious choice for an honour, given his long list of stage  and screen successes. But his recommendation came  at a time when homosexuality was still illegal and public opinion remained  bitterly divided on the issue. In the late 1950s, as many as 1,000 men a year were being jailed for the offence, with high-profile convictions including actor John Gielgud and motor museum founder Lord Montagu of Beaulieu. Michael Darlow, author of the book Terence Rattigan: The Man And His Work, said: ‘The police were beginning to crack down on anyone who spoke out in favour of a relaxation of a law. Nigel Hawthorne (as Arthur Winslow, centre) in a film adaptation of The Winslow Boy . 'You can imagine, in that climate, officials would have thought twice about honouring someone who was homosexual.’ Rattigan had numerous lovers but no long-term partner and his sexuality would have been no secret to his friends or theatrical peers. It is possible officials may have put their initial concerns to one side in 1958 following the publication of the Wolfenden Report in 1957 which recommended that the laws on same-sex relationships should be reformed. Rattigan died in 1977, but revivals of his work have included a 2011 West End production of Flare Path, starring Sienna Miller and Sheridan Smith, and the National Theatre’s acclaimed 2010 production of After The Dance, with Benedict Cumberbatch.

"Vice President Joe Biden on Sunday called the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates to clarify that he did not mean to imply in his remarks last week that the Gulf ally was supporting al-Qaida fighters in Syria, the White House said. Biden spoke with Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi and a key Emirati leader, the White House said. It was the second time in two days that Biden had to call a key partner in President Barack Obama's coalition to walk back comments he made on Thursday, when he said that U.S. allies - including Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the UAE - had funded and armed extremist groups linked to al-Qaida. Earlier Sunday, an exasperated UAE requested 'a formal clarification' from Biden on comments that America's allies in the Middle East sent weapons and cash to extremists fighting in Syria. Did I do that? Vice President Joe Biden has been forced to apologize for remarks he made while speaking at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, when he said 'our biggest problem is our allies' supplying guns and weapons to ISIS extremists fighting in Syria . Eating his foot: Biden had already apologized over the remarks to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (left). UAE's foreign affairs minister, Anwar Gargash (right), said the comments were 'far from the truth' The White House said Biden clarified his remarks and recognized the UAE's 'strong steps' to counter extremists and participation in U.S.-led airstrikes against Islamic State militants. The White House statement said Biden's remarks regarding the early stages of the Syrian civil war 'were not meant to imply that the UAE had facilitated or supported' al-Qaida, the Islamic State group or other extremists in Syria. The UAE's official news agency said Biden had 'apologized to UAE for any implications in his recent statements that were understood to mean that UAE has backed the growth of some of the terrorist organizations in the region.' Biden a day earlier apologized to Turkey over his comments, made Thursday during a question-and-answer session at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Biden said that 'our biggest problem is our allies' who are engaged in a proxy Sunni-Shiite war against Syrian President Bashar Assad. He specifically named Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. 'What did they do? They poured hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of tons of weapons into anyone who would fight against Assad — except that the people who were being supplied were (Jabhat) al-Nusra and al-Qaida and the extremist elements of jihadis coming from other parts of the world,' he said. What was he thinking? An exasperated UAE requested 'a formal clarification' from Biden on comments that America's allies in the Middle East sent weapons and cash to extremists fighting in Syria . The UAE's official news agency carried a statement from Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash calling Biden's comments 'far from the truth.' The UAE Foreign Ministry said it was astonished by the remarks. The UAE is a key Arab partner in the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State group and has targeted its fighters in airstrikes in Syria. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Jordan also have carried out airstrikes against the group in Iraq and Syria, while Qatar has provided logistical support. Gargash said the vice president 'gave a negative and inaccurate impression' about the UAE's support in confronting the Islamic State group and terrorism. He said Biden's statement ignored the political and practical steps taken by the UAE, as well as its position against terrorism financing. 'The UAE's counter-terrorism approach reflects a pioneering national commitment that recognizes the extent of the danger posed by terrorism to the region and to its people,' Gargash said. There has been no official comment from Saudi officials over Biden's comments. On Saturday, Biden called to apologize to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the White House said. 'The vice president apologized for any implication that Turkey or other allies and partners in the region had intentionally supplied or facilitated the growth of ISIL or other violent extremists in Syria,' the White House said, using an acronym for the Islamic State group.

"If Jose Mourinho's Chelsea side do race away with this season's Premier League title, the acquisitions of Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas will no doubt be looked upon as the main components to a successful campaign. Such flair and creativity from the Chelsea attack, however, would not be able to flourish without the solid blue wall that consists of Branislav Ivanovic, Gary Cahill, John Terry and Cesar Azpilicueta. This season has seen a more expansive Chelsea than fans are used to under Mourinho with the likes of Eden Hazard and Fabregas supplying the ammo for £32million man Costa, who already has nine Premier League goals to his name. John Terry has played every minute of Chelsea's Premier League campaign so far . Cesar Azpilicueta (left) and Branislav Ivanovic provide a solid platform for Chelsea to attack . Although Southampton sit top of the fewest goals conceded charts, letting in just five so far, Chelsea's back line is one that breeds confidence and looks ready for any kind of battle they may face together. Chelsea's back four would have played in every minute of Chelsea's 10 Premier League games so far this season had in not been for Azpilicueta's three-game ban following his red card against Crystal Palace last month and it's no coincidence that this consistency is giving the team a superb platform to build from. The difference between the league leaders and their rivals this season is the fact that they have four warriors at the back. Manchester City can always rely on captain Vincent Kompany, Arsenal fans will tell you Per Mertesacker is the man, while Manchester United are calling out for a defender of Terry's caliber following the departure of Nemanja Vidic. Terry has 75 per cent of his tackled during his 900 minutes of Premier League football . In his 2014-15 defence, Mourinho has a four-piece that have been playing together for the best part of two years and their qualities lend themselves perfectly to the Portuguese manager's desire to see his team defend properly. It's no surprise that Mourinho was quick to get rid of flamboyant defender David Luiz last summer, he was always going to be too unpredictable to nail down a starting place in the Premier League. Filipe Luis, a huge part of Atletico Madrid's impressive defence last season, can't get a look in despite costing the club £16m and despite Azpilicueta not actually being left-footed. Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville recently claimed Azpilicueta is as 'near to perfect as possible when it comes to defending.' He was right - a quick glance at the Spaniard's stats so far this season show that Azpilicueta has won 91.7 per cent of his tackles while making 17 interceptions in his eight appearances for the Stamford Bridge club. When asked who he though was the best defender is the Premier League, Neville said: 'I’d say, for consistency of performances, it would be one of the Chelsea lads – and I’d probably say Azpilicueta. Nemanja Matic acts as the spoiler in Chelsea's well-drilled midfield unit to have impressed so much . 'For technical defending, not making a mistake, not being in the wrong position, not getting caught out… I don’t see him making a mistake.' On the opposing flank, Chelsea have a monster of a defender in Ivanovic who rarely gets beaten in a show of strength or even speed. After a pre-season without World Cup football, the Serbia captain hit the ground running and nailed down his right back position just when it looked as though he'd be the man to drop out of Mourinho's starting XI this term. The centre back pairing of Cahill and Terry continues to be the best defensive partnership in the domestic league by some distance. Although Cahill can at times look slightly out of sorts without Terry at his side, the England vice-captain has improved ten-fold since his move from Bolton in 2012. At the tender age of 33, Terry still seems to bring the best out of the players around him while still performing at a level most Premier League centre halves can only admire. The Chelsea skipper continues to flourish in the absence of international football and his experience will be vital to the west London club's title push. Jose Mourinho has seen his side concede late goals at the Etihad, Old Trafford and Selhurst Park this season . The Blues defence may be impressive, but Mourinho will still be frustrated with the fact that his side have kept just three clean sheets so far this season - there is room for improvement. The 50-year-old boss has seen his side concede late goals at the Etihad, Old Trafford and Selhurst Park this season which is something Mourinho will be looking to cut out. Despite that fact, Mourinho can take confidence from watching his rivals struggle to field the same back four each weekend. United's defence has lost the likes Vidic and Patrice Evra while being plagued with injuries, Manuel Pellegrini seems to have a desire to rotate his City full backs and is having to allow Eliaquim Mangala time to adapt while title contenders Liverpool and Arsenal struggle to keep pace after a poor summer transfer window.

"This week the pop diva presented us with a cropped, curved fringe . She has a flawless face, curvaceous figure and high-fashion style — not to mention millions of fans — so it’s little wonder that when pop star Beyonce debuts a new look, it sparks a wave of imitations. Yet the 33-year-old this week presented us with a hairstyle only the bold will seek to emulate: a cropped, curved fringe spookily reminiscent of Friar Tuck. Even her most ardent admirers were horrified. What had possessed Beyonce to hack her tumbling caramel waves so severely? Well, it seems that she may not have been brave, or silly, enough to go for the chop after all. The offending fringe’s only saving grace seems to be that hairdressers believe it is in fact a ‘winge’ — or a fringe wig. ‘I have no doubt that, in Beyonce’s case, the fringe is a wig. A badly positioned, untidy, fringe wig,’ says celebrity stylist Andrew Barton. ‘Winges are really popular on the catwalks, with some designers sending armies of models down the runway with identical ones clipped in, but Beyonce’s is all wrong. 'Had it been straight, sleek and perfectly groomed, it could have been a bold and fashionable statement. Instead, the look is a dry, bristly broom — more Goon Show than fashion show.’ Fringe wigs are roughly 6in long sections of hair with clips attached to them, which can be used to attach the hairpiece to the crown, and are styled to look like natural hair. While they may sound — and often look — utterly bizarre, they have been growing in popularity in Britain over the past six years, since hairdressing chain Hershesons launched them in salons and online. They are now available for as little as £20 from High Street stores such as Topshop, and come in a range of shades to match different hair colours. While the cheaper ones will be made of nylon, and may have an unnatural sheen and texture, for £50 to £70 it is possible to buy one made of human hair. Beyonce isn’t the only celebrity to road-test a fringe while running shy of taking the chop. Actresses Nicole Kidman and Penelope Cruz are both said to have sported clip-in fringes on the red carpet, while reality TV star Kim Kardashian has gushed about her love of fake fringes. Actresses Nicole Kidman (left) and Penelope Cruz (right) are also said to have worn winges on the red carpet . For someone with my chequered history with fringes — I’m still reeling from the hideous pageboy cut my mother inflicted on me when I was six — the prospect of trying a new clip-on look without committing to a radical re-style is far more appealing. And if it doesn’t work — mentioning no names, Beyonce — you can just take it out. Quick! Pop diva winge . How we did it: We used £30 clip-in winges from Daniel Hersheson’s online boutique hershesons.com to give me five very different fringes. With this one, the stylist clipped it in place, an inch in front of my crown, and chopped steadily. She created an undercut in the fringe, where the top layer is longer than the layers underneath, giving it the appearance of a ledge standing proud of the forehead. Annabel's verdict: The winge of the moment is not for me — not now, not ever! I looked in the mirror and was reminded of the time my four-year-old daughter cut her own hair with a pair of nail scissors. If this is high fashion, why do I look so frumpy? If I had a stylist, I’d sack her immediately. Frump: ‘It looked like my four year old had been at it with nail scissors’ says Annabel of the Pop Diva Winge (left), while the eyebrow grazing winge (right) left her flustered after half an hour . Eyebrow Grazing Winge . How we did it: This hardly needed any styling. The hairdresser simply clipped in the winge and gently cut upwards into it, creating a shattered edge — I could easily do this one at home. Annabel's verdict: I quite liked peering out from under my fringe in a sultry fashion — and it certainly hides the wrinkles on my forehead. But after half an hour I was getting flustered and desperately wanted to scrape my hair away from my face. Victory Roll Winge . How we did it: My ingenious hairdresser grabbed an old roller, cut it length-ways and re-rolled it, into a tighter cyclinder. She then clipped in the winge, and pinned it around the roller to create a short, tight roll across the top of my forehead. Annabel's verdict: I wasn’t expecting to love this cartoonish, bubble fringe. And, lo and behold . . . I didn’t. It felt totally ridiculous and rather precarious, as the synthetic winge tried to unfurl itself. Unflattering and frankly silly, there’s no way I’d try this one again. Annabel was expecting to love the victory roll winge (left) but was left feeling silly. The side sweep winge on the other hand . Side Sweep Winge . How we did it: The hairdresser took a winge and clipped it in on at a slight angle, along the line of my parting. In order to conceal the join, she resorted to craftily pinning pieces of my own hair over the top. Annabel's verdict: When you live behind a curtain of thick hair, as I do, this kind of half fringe is good for softening your look. I don’t think I could style it . Long Blunt Winge . How we did it: The stylist gave my own hair a centre-parting, and clipped the winge high, close to my crown. Then she set about cutting it bluntly and drastically, so it sat half an inch or so above my eyebrows. Annabel's verdict: I’ve always secretly admired the iconic style of Uma Thurman in Pulp Fiction, and wondered whether I could pull of that very blunt fringe. This settles that debate. It looks awful, highlighting my strong jaw. I’d have to wear huge amounts of make-up to look remotely glamorous. Annabel thought the long blunt winge (left) highlighted her strong jaw and that she would have to wear huge amounts of make-up to look glamorous. She is pictured with the clip-in fringe, right . Fancy a boiled egg? Bored of your daily lunchtime sandwich? How about a fresh boiled egg with a perfectly soft yolk, brewed in the office kettle? Place your egg in the kettle and cover it with an inch of water. The important thing is to keep the egg away from the heating element so you will need to tilt the kettle at an angle — try putting a pad of Post-it notes beneath one side of it. This will keep the egg clear of the metal element. Boil the kettle. When it turns itself off, start a timer (on your mobile phone if you don’t have an egg timer to hand) and leave your egg in the kettle for 12 minutes. Then drain the water away very carefully and take your egg out. Let it cool for a minute or two and it’s ready to eat. Do be careful as you’re doing it not to scald yourself. And don’t be surprised if your colleagues object to their cups of tea taking on a slightly sulphurous taste.","Beyonce this week showcased a cropped, curved fringe to mixed reviews .

"The New Hampshire parents whose son was shot dead by his best friend have vowed to offer the killer a home and a job once he's released from prison. Donald St. Laurent II, 29, was shot in the head in 2011 by Christopher Bazar, who admitted to being drunk and high when he fired the shotgun. Bazar, now 30, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to four to 10 years in prison. His sentence was reduced, mostly because the victim's parents begged a judge for leniency. He was granted parole on Thursday and is expected to be released in a few weeks. Christopher Bazar, 30, pleaded guilty to manslaughter in 2011 over the shooting death of his best friend, Donald St. Laurent. The victim's parents have offered to help him get back on his feet when he's released from prison . Now Bazar will move in with the victim's mother, Deborah St. Laurent, in her home in Nashua. The victim's father, Donald St. Laurent, will give him a roofing job at his construction company. 'It's the end of a long road and the beginning of a new one,' Bazar said, according to WMUR. 'It's a good day. It's a great day.' Deborah and Donald St. Laurent have long believed the shooting was an accident. Since Bazar's trial, the victim's parents have strongly defended Bazar and begged Judge Jacalyn Colburn for leniency because they never believed the shooting to have been intentional. Bazar will live with the victim's mother and work for the father's construction company . The two men had been 'close as brothers' and shared the apartment where the tragedy happened. 'He's my other son,' Deborah St. Laurent said in court, according to WMUR. 'My son loved him, and I love my son more than life.' She added: 'My son loved him, and I know it was an accident. 'And I know that this is what my son would want me to do.' In the minutes after the shooting, Bazar sobbed uncontrollably as he spoke to a 911 operator about what happened. He later said he had been drinking and smoking marijuana that night. Bazar says he's worked through his drinking issues and is ready to be released. 'If I felt like I needed to drink, I’d just think of that night — and it thoroughly disgusts me,' he told the parole board, according to The Nashua Telegraph. 'Prison saved my life,' Bazar added. 'I’m very lucky, in an unlucky way.' The victim's brother, Daniel St. Laurent, says Bazar has struggled  to cope with what he's done. 'Killing your best friend is more of a punishment than the state of New Hampshire or anybody could ever give anybody,' says the the Army sergeant, who was serving in Afghanistan when the shooting happened. 'And I don't want to lose another brother.'","Christopher Bazar, 30, pleaded guilty in 2011 to shooting his best friend and roommate Donald St. Laurent II in New Hampshire .

"From the elaborate turrets to the hidden room of reflection, it’s a painstakingly detailed tribute to a medieval castle. But it seems Jools Holland was so engrossed in recreating the past that he forgot one very modern detail – planning permission. Now the 55-year-old BBC presenter could be forced to tear down the structure, which he built in the seven-acre grounds of his country mansion near Rochester in Kent. Jools Holland has this wall and raised flowerbed built in the garden of his Kent home without planning consent . Holland bought the house, which is on the site of the 14th century Cooling Castle, 11 years ago. The ruins of the old castle still dominate the grounds, but evidently Holland wanted a new one, too. So the musician built a two-storey walled structure to surround his swimming pool and his newly planted patriotic garden, laid out in the shape of a Union Flag. The walls contain a built-in parvis – a type of medieval room designed for quiet reflection. Despite the size of the imposing  construction, he apparently did not realise that he needed to ask for planning permission. The musician has now made a retrospective planning application to Medway council. The Later presenter, pictured with his wife Christabel, has applied to his local Medway Council for retrospective planning permission for the wall . The application boasts of the wall’s ‘high standard of construction’ and use of local stone. It reads: ‘The new wall and planters create a cohesive and attractive garden area viewable from the main house and the adjacent swimming pool and annexe. ‘Care has been taken to maintain the high standard of construction and detailing used elsewhere. ‘The wall itself has been constructed to match identically those already around the swimming pool, using natural local stone laid in lime mortar. The wall also has ‘crenellations’ along the top, which in a real castle would have been used by bowmen to fire arrows down on attackers. The application continues: ‘At the west end of the wall, a set of steps leads up to a small room  sitting over a gateway that leads to the northern end of the garden.This room has no practical use but has been built as a visual feature using historic references. ‘As far as we have been able to establish, we think that such a structure is known as a parvis.’ A Medway council spokesman said: ‘The works that were carried out were undertaken by the owner on the assumption that planning permission was not required. He was subsequently advised that this was not correct and submitted a planning application.’ So far, no neighbours have objected to his plans. Mr Holland is a well-known figure in the nearby village of Cooling and used its church for his 2005 wedding to long-term girlfriend Christabel McEwen. Celebrities including Ringo Starr, Mick Hucknall, Lulu, Dawn French and Stephen Fry attended the ceremony. Aerial view of Jools Holland's Kent house showing the garden where he has built a medieval-style wall . Since buying the property, Mr Holland has added a music room, annexe and entrance hall to the manor house, as well as a large swimming pool. A previous survey of the land, made when the swimming pool was built, said: ‘There was unlikely to be any archaeological remains of any significance in the area.’ Cooling Castle, which now consists only of four rough stone walls and a gatehouse, is on the ‘Heritage at Risk’ list of important listed buildings. According to English Heritage, it is in a ‘very bad’ condition and in need of A-list priority attention. Holland received an OBE in 2004 for services to the British music industry as a television presenter and musician. He is also a Deputy Lieutenant of Kent. His wife is a member of a landed Scottish family and was formerly married to the Earl of Durham. Holland formed his 20-piece Rhythm & Blues Orchestra after starting his own Big Band. He has a weekly show on Radio 2, as well as hosting the television show Later... with Jools Holland. His annual Hootenanny has become a staple of New Year’s Eve television. Last night Holland and his planning agent, architect Julian Bluck, were both unavailable to comment.","BBC 2 Later presenter built vast wall in garden of his Kent country house .

"Saturday Night Live's ratings were on life-support this week, with the Bill Hader back in the hosting role after leaving the show in 2013. In spite of Hader bringing back Weekend Update character Stefon for a victory lap, viewership was down, tying a previous record set by Charlize Theron who hosted back in May. Deadline reports that the episode, which featured musical guests Hozier, averaged 3.8 for metered-market households and 1.8 for adults 18-49, down from 3.9 and 1.9 from last week when Sarah Silverman took on hosting duties. Scroll down for video . In the tank: Saturday Night Live's ratings continue to slip, but with Bill Hader as host they tied for a record low . The slump can't be blamed on Hader, as ratings for the late-night show have been slipping since last season, after the departures of Kristen Wiig, Andy Samberg, Jason Sudekis and Bill Hader left it unable to produce consistently funny episodes. Hader was no worse for wear during his return to New York a hiatus of more than a year. In addition to Stefon, he dusted off his crotchety reporter character Herb Welch and nailed an Al Pacino impression. The AV Club gave the episode an A-, and other outlets had praise for Hader taking on the duties of host. Defamer breaks down the numbers, finding that other Saturday Night Live alums have fared much better. Jimmy Fallon hosted the Christmas episode, hitting a 6.3 for households, while Tina Fey, hosting last season's premiere, scored a 4.7. Still, the best comparison might be Andy Samberg, who similarly to Hader is just beginning to develop on his own outside of Saturday Night Live. Reunited: Former castmate Kristen Wiig and Harvey Firestein joined Hader during the musical number he chose for his opening monologue spot . Slipping: Bobby Moynihan played a Kim Jong-un with a limp in an opening sketch that largely failed to deliver much comedy . Impressionist: Hader flexed the muscles on some old characters, including Stefon and Herb Welch, a crotchety field reporter from WXPD News New York . His 4.0 during last season's finale puts him not far out of reach. Then again, all the worrying could be for nothing. Nielsen, the company that measures ratings, announced last Friday that it had been getting its numbers wrong since March. The company blamed the errors on a software glitch, which it said mostly affected ABC shows by causing ratings to stay unusually high.","Hader returned to host after leaving the show in 2013 .

"With at least seven million viewers expected to tune in to the finale of the Broadchurch detective series last night, executives at ITV can congratulate themselves on a winning programme. But once the fans of the murder mystery finally found out who killed Danny Latimer, their next question was: Is there a second series? And they won't be the only ones: shopkeepers, restaurateurs and hoteliers in the Dorset village of West Bay where Broadchurch is filmed are also hoping for another run after business boomed thanks to fans of the show coming in their droves. Local businesses in West Bay on Dorset's Jurassic Coast are hoping for a second series of Broadchurch - as are fans . West Bay, in Dorset, has become popular with fans of Broadchurch who want to see where the series was filmed . The dramatic cliffs of West Bay have lent a stark backdrop to the gripping whodunnit series, starring David Tennant, which concluded last night. And local businesses, which suffered last summer from a combination of poor weather and the distracting Olympic sailing event up the road in Weymouth, have profited from it. West Bay's newsagent Richard Attrill, whose shop was filmed in the show, said: 'If I had a pound for every time the shop has been photographed, I'd close the shop. West Bay has long been a destination for food-lovers, but now television viewers are flocking there, too . 'I know people are coming here because of the series because they tell me.' In the show, newsagent Jack Marshall killed himself in the fifth episode after being outed as a sex offender.  After the episode was broadcast, Mr Attrill put up a sign saying 'Under new management', and soon saw people taking photographs of his shop window. He said the Olympics sailing in Weymouth had an obvious effect on tourist numbers in West Bay, leaving the village's car park practically empty. West Bay is already known as a foodie . destination, but local cafes, restaurants and shops have noticed a . surge in visitor numbers thanks to Broadchurch. Maurice .

Paul Coates: The odds on the local vicar and recovering alcoholic being to blame are 9/2. Oliver Stevens: Odds on the ambitious local journalist having done it are 8/1. Nigel Carter: The handyman certainly looks the part, and bookies are offering 10/1 on him being the culprit. Steve Connelly: He seems to know a lot about the case but also wants to help the family: 10/1. Jack Marshall: The convicted paedophile was the prime suspect until he committed suicide, but now we're not so sure. 14/1. Mark Latimer:  Danny's grieving father was the prime suspect but he might just be guilty of having an affair. 20/1. Dean Thomas: This druggie sixth-form student has odds of 22/1 on being the murderer. Becca Fisher: The hotelier who had an affair with Danny's father ranks as an outsider at 25/1. Susan Wright: The misanthropic cleaner found and hid Danny's skateboard after he died, but is only rated at 33/1. OUTSIDERS: Danny's devastated mother Chloe Latimer, the kind local newspaper editor Maggie Radcliffe, and police officers DI Alec Hardy, played by David Tennant, and DS Ellie Miller are all assumed by fans of the show to be in the clear.

"This is the shocking moment a horse collapsed and died while pulling tourists up a steep hill at Shenzhen Safari Park in China. The upsetting incident occurred in front of children and has sparked outrage on Chinese social media and accusations that the emaciated animal died from overwork and neglect. Facing massive criticism, the zoo claims that the horse died from a heart attack, not malnourishment or exhaustion. Shocking: The emaciated horse dropped dead in front of horrified visitors at Shenzhen Safari Park . According to media in China, the horse dropped dead while pulling a heavy carriage occupied by four tourists for the twelfth time that day. The photos were taken by tourist Shi Lin, who said: ‘I was visiting the park and it was the first thing I saw, this horse dropping on the ground and falling over dead. ‘Its eyes and mouth were wide open and it looks really skinny and malnourished. It happened while it was trying to get up the slope, to be honest it looks too weak to coach let alone the driver and four passengers.’ The death occurred during the Golden Week holiday period at the wildlife park in southern China’s Guangdong Province, located north of Hong Kong. Prices for the popular horse and carriage rides are doubled during public holidays and horses are forced to work more to meet demand. According to media in China, the horse died while pulling a carriage for the twelfth time that day . Shenzhen Safari Park management denied that they are responsible, claiming the rides had been subcontracted to a third party who holds all responsibility for the horses’ welfare. But zoo officials were unable to provide a copy of a signed contract or a name for the subcontractor when they were questioned by reporters. A zoo worker told Chinese media: ‘Horses are like people. They can fall ill and suffer from diseases such as heart attacks and thrombosis. ‘Horses can live as long as 20 years and this one is about 15 years old.’ Park management attempted to deflect responsibility, claiming a subcontractor is to blame . Claims of abuse and neglect: A thin horse is seen pulling the same carriage as the one that died .","Shocking incident occurred at Shenzhen Safari Park in Guangdong Province .

"Oh, how celebrities love Twitter. They can pour out whatever drivel they please without interruption. But best of all, for them at least, they can get paid for their ‘thoughts’ on the social networking site. A sting on soap stars in Manchester, which was revealed this week, has shown just how commercial celebrity tweets have become. Actors from Coronation Street were invited to a ‘gifting event’ at a Manchester Hotel and then wrote glowing tweets about freebie goodies they’d been given by a fake company called Puttanta Aziendale (amusingly, in Italian that means ‘corporate whore’). Sponsored: Actress Amanda Holden (left) and singer Alesha Dixon (right) have both been seen to plug their sponsors on Twitter . They may have claimed they were tricked into writing the tweets, but the investigation has highlighted a growing grey area where celebrities are using Twitter for their own gain. In the U.S., stars such as Kim Kardashian — who has 18 million followers on Twitter — can earn up to £7,000 for a single 140-character tweet if she mentions a particular product. Here, footballer Wayne Rooney was rapped by the advertising watchdog the ASA for posting links written by his Nike sponsors. The ASA deemed the tweets to be more like adverts — but that doesn’t appear to have stopped more recent tweets about Rooney’s new Nike golf club, for example. Others are more subtle when it comes to their commercial tweets, whether it is a TV presenter talking about the wonderful designer clothes she has been given or the sports star who tweets about her new car, but fails to mention it came courtesy of her sponsor. What’s becoming increasingly clear is that Twitter — once a forum for celebrities to express their real feelings — is increasingly becoming a business. The biggest stars can earn up to £100,000 a year (in ready cash or the equivalent in freebies) simply for telling their followers their sponsored ‘thoughts’. Here, the Mail looks at some of the worst offenders. Tweeter: Elizabeth Hurley has been known to subtly mention Estee Lauder - without giving away the fact she is paid thousands by them each year for promotional work . ELIZABETH HURLEY . Engaged to Aussie cricketer Shane Warne, the self-styled ‘mum, model, actress, bikini designer, organic farmer’ is worth £7 million and has 300,000 followers. WHAT SHE TWEETS ABOUT: In between flirting with her fiancé via Twitter and endless plugs about her bikini and bedding ranges, and acting work, Elizabeth also finds time to subtly mention Estee Lauder — without giving away the fact she is paid thousands by them each year for promotional work. In May, she wrote ‘salivating over my new @Estee Lauder goodies’ and  a day later: ‘And thank you @Estee Lauder for the arsenal of lip goodies.’ SHAMELESS PLUGGING: 6/10 VICTORIA BECKHAM . The Spice Girl turned fashion designer, 39, has 6.3 million followers — and is worth a cool  £40 million. WHAT SHE TWEETS ABOUT: There is a lot about her jet-setting and clothing line, and plenty about how handsome her husband is, but she  still manages to fit in a few plugs for some of the many items she gets free or hugely discounted. These include Chloe slippers: ‘How cute are these!!!’; white designer shoes: ‘Obsessed with my new white @ManoloBlahniks’; more shoes: ‘Thank you @Prada for my shoes!!! How posh, they have my initials on!!!’ And there is other designer gear which is all pictured: ‘Nicest socks ever! Comme de Garcons’; ‘Manolo Blahnik candles!!! Super chic.’ And even stuff for her 23-month-old fashion plate daughter (and favourite accessory) Harper: ‘Super cute jelly shoes for Harper from Vivienne Westwood  @FollowWestwood.’ SHAMELESS PLUGGING: 9/10 . Stars: Kim Kardashian (left) can earn up to £7,000 for a single 140-character tweet if she mentions a particular product while Justin Bieber (right) has a serious amount of 'Beliebers' who hang on his every word . KIM KARDASHIAN . The curvy 32-year-old American reality star, aka ‘the world’s worst role model’, recently gave birth to a daughter called North West (yes, really). She’s reportedly worth  £14 million and has 18 million Twitter followers. WHAT SHE TWEETS ABOUT: There is a lot about the Kardashians’ huge ‘Kollection’ of wares; just about anything from clothes to bronzing lotion. Everyone, it seems, wants to get that Kardashian look and she is there to help you — by plugging the stuff she is given. If you want to be as sparkly as her, you could try ‘Necklace sparkling on my face #LoveDannijoJewellery,’; if you want her decorative look, there is ‘chic @lampsplus lighting’; or if you have sore lips ‘@EOS to the rescue!’ It goes on. SHAMELESS PLUGGING: 10/10 . Glamour-model: Katie Price tweets about companies who pay her - such as the chocolate bar Snickers - or give her free stuff . JUSTIN BIEBER . The Canadian singer is beloved by obsessed teenagers around the world — which is why 41 million follow the 19-year-old on Twitter. WHAT HE TWEETS ABOUT: Justin has a serious amount of ‘Beliebers’ who hang on his every word. A lot of his tweets are about his day-to-day activities as he tours the world. But there are several plugs for sponsor Adidas, such as ‘Shooting with @adidasNEOLabel today. Making them make longer shirts’. Another was for his range of telephone cases made by Cellairis: ‘u got one?’ he asks. He doesn’t forget his tour sponsor: ‘Shoutout to  @essence_US cosmetics.

"Sir John Betjeman may have rhapsodised about playing tennis with Joan Hunter Dunn, who had ‘the speed of a swallow, the grace of a boy’. But the modern tennis heroine has rather more weapons in her arsenal — and we are not just talking about ability on the court. Eugenie Bouchard, 20 years old and Canadian, is gloriously blonde with perfectly regular, brilliantly white film-star teeth, a pair of oiled thighs that could crack walnuts, half a million fans on Facebook — and a Twitter profile which ranges from the flirtatious to the, frankly, provocative. Indeed, the new face of women’s tennis — who will be fighting to be crowned Wimbledon champion today — likes to post pictures of herself lounging seductively in bikinis and pouting in fancy dress. Scroll down for video . Happier times: Canadian tennis star Eugenie Bouchard, 20, used to be inseparable from British player Laura Robson, . pictured left - but there has been an acrimonious falling out between . the pair . She is as much the queen of the selfie as the queen of the court. Canny, money-making and with an ambition and drive which make the rest of the tennis crowd — no offence Maria Sharapova — look like a bunch of shuffling amateurs. Her smitten fans, known as the Genie Army, follow her around the globe and, in a mawkish display of puppy love, throw teddy bears on to the court, some with proposals of marriage attached. Adorable though she may be, Eugenie can also be utterly ruthless — in a charming way — when it comes to fulfilling her role as champ-in-waiting. For example, she was once best friends . with British tennis hope Laura Robson, who is also 20. They met aged . nine and were inseparable for a decade. They . were once so close that Canadian Bouchard stayed with Robson at her . family home near the All England Club when they played there. As . teenagers they dined together every night during overseas tournaments . and two years ago made a video featuring tennis stars — including . Sharapova — performing Gangnam Style dance moves. BFFs no more: When asked if she was close with Robson anymore, Bouchard said: 'No. I don't think so. I'm sure you guys can figure out that one... I'll leave it at that' Tight bond: As teenagers Bouchard would stay at Robson's house when she played at Wimbledon . But there has been an acrimonious falling out. Asked yesterday if they were still close, Bouchard responded bluntly: ‘No. I don’t think so,’ adding ‘I’m sure you guys can figure out that one  . . . I’ll leave it at that.’ The rift is believed to be over Nick Saviano, the leading coach who runs the Florida tennis academy where they first met. While the pair previously shared his services, he now coaches Bouchard exclusively. Their friendship has deteriorated further during the past year as Bouchard accelerated ahead of her former friend. She has climbed into the tennis top ranks, while Robson peaked when she reached the fourth round of last year’s Wimbledon, then missed this year’s championships with a wrist injury. She now languishes at 91 in the world rankings. Tennis insiders say the girls no longer speak, let alone post pictures of themselves together on social networking sites as they once did so regularly. But the duo, pictured in June last year at the pre-Wimbledon . party, reportedly fell out after their joint coach Nick Saviano started to work with Bouchard exclusively . Before the French Open, Bouchard said she didn’t have a best friend: ‘I don’t think the tennis tour is the place to have friends. For me it’s all competition.’ Where her twin sister Beatrice is concerned, Eugenie says they are ‘opposites’ and ‘very different’. Beatrice, she adds, ‘retired from tennis aged six’, and they see little of each other as Eugenie criss-crosses the globe in search of sporting glory. Beatrice, a student, is the older by six minutes. Speaking to reporters, she claimed to have a telepathic link with Eugenie and broke into a broad smile over her sister’s achievements. ‘Every day I am just in awe,’ she said. ‘I have seen everything she has missed out on in childhood and teenage years. She has sacrificed a lot to get where she is today.’ Eugenie has self-belief and focus by the bucketload. When she met tennis legend Chris Evert at an event in Singapore in January, she was far from over-awed. Evert tweeted: ‘@GenieBouchard has informed me that there are more cameras focused on her . . .’ By the end of the day they were apparently friends, and Evert wrote: ‘Ok, spent the whole day with @GenieBouchard . Impressions: genuine, mature, determined, and really funny!!!’ Or, as she told a reporter that day, more bluntly: ‘She is as tough as nails.’ So who is Eugenie? Born on February 25, 1994, in Montreal, she is the product of a wealthy suburban upbringing. Her father Michel Bouchard, known as Mike, is an investment banker, and mum Julie LeClair is a great fan of the Royal Family — which is why she called her twin girls Eugenie and Beatrice. ‘When I was young my mum gave me a magazine with the two Princesses in it and I still keep it on my bedside table,’ Bouchard says. Her younger brother is named William after Prince William and the eldest of the siblings is Charlotte, after Princess Charlotte Casiraghi of Monaco. Home was in the posh suburb of Westmount — in the same street as former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. The children were introduced to tennis at a young age, but Eugenie, then aged five, detested the ‘childish’ games involving hula hoops and balloons that were supposed to interest them in the sport. The Canadian player, who is becoming the face of women's tennis has an army of fans dubbed 'The Genie Army', faces No 6 seed Petra Kvitova tomorrow in the women's singles final at Wimbledon . Fist pump: Bouchard celebrates a point in her match against Romania's Simona Halep during the Ladies semi-finals on July 3 . ‘All of the kids, including my sister, . loved the games, except me,’ she told the Canadian Globe and Mail . newspaper. ‘I hated them, I just wanted to hit more balls and actually . play tennis. ‘Eventually, I . started playing three times a week, then took private lessons and played . my first tournament aged eight. I loved it right away.’ Extraordinarily, . this was when she decided that tennis was to be her life. ‘Nine is very . young to decide what you want to do in life, but that is pretty much . when I decided,’ she said. When she was 12, Eugenie had the chance to move to Florida to train with coach Nick Saviano at his academy. The whole family relocated to Florida from Montreal — and moved back a few years later, after Tennis Canada agreed to pay for an exclusive trainer for her in Montreal. She continues to train with Saviano in Florida for part of the year, and spends the rest of it on the tour, going home to Montreal for visits when she can. Fancy dress: Tennis star Eugenie Bouchard, 20, right, pictured with her twin sister Beatrice in 'sexy policewomen' costume . Mike Bouchard — like the parents of champs Andre Agassi and Steffi Graff — has taken a hands-on approach to building his daughter’s sporting career, sometimes with excessive zeal. Bouchard tried to claim thousands that he personally spent on his daughter’s dream in 2004, 2005 and 2006 as business losses against tax — but Canada’s tax service disallowed it. An embarrassing episode perhaps, but Eugenie continued her march to tennis glory. She won Junior Wimbledon in 2012 and last year was named WTA tennis newcomer of the year. She reached the semis of the 2014 Australian Open in January and the 2014 French Open. Her prize money to date stands at £1 million — her greater earnings come from endorsements, which so far include Nike and Coke, and she has been in Vogue and other fashion magazines. She is now being courted by watch manufacturers, jewellery designers, clothes labels and banks. Sharapova, the best financially rewarded female athlete on the planet, netted £15 million last year with her deals with Tiffany, Omega, et al. Eugenie’s agent, Sam Duvall, is tipping her to become the most famous player in the world. ‘She’s got the personality, she’s got the game, she’s got the looks,’ he said. ‘She speaks two languages [French and English] and the crossover appeal is great. Aussie fans love her, French fans love her.’ ‘She understands that the better she plays tennis, the more money, the more marketable and the more famous she will be. But it’s all centred on the tennis.’ Nigel Currie, of sports agency Brand Rapport, agrees that Bouchard could unseat the glorious Sharapova as the game’s top earner. Her use of social media already sets her apart and makes her all the more valuable as a commodity.  She is, online at least, an unabashed flirt — posting a selfie with the actor Owen Wilson earlier this year; a picture of herself on her birthday, lying on her bed surrounded by flowers and birthday wishes; and one on Valentine’s day with a hand-drawn card: ‘From me, to me.’ All of which makes her fans love her even more. She is, though, apparently quietly going out with American ice hockey player Alex Galchenyuk, who plays for a Canadian team. Before that she was dating Australian tennis star Bernard Tomic. She faces No 6 seed Petra Kvitova today as Canada’s first Grand Slam singles finalist at Wimbledon, and is brimming with confidence. ‘It’s not a surprise to me. I expect to be in these finals. I totally feel like I belong. I want to make my own history.’ As well as her own millions.","Canadian Eugenie Bouchard, 20, will compete in Wimbledon singles final .

"Pastygate: David Cameron became embroiled in a pasty tax fiasco yesterday when he was apparently caught telling fibs about his love of the hot snacks. He is pictured eating a pastry-based product in 2010 . David Cameron became embroiled in a pasty tax fiasco yesterday when he was apparently caught telling fibs about his love of the hot snacks. The Prime Minister spoke out following public anger at the Chancellor’s decision to slap a 20 per cent VAT surcharge on hot pasties sold by high street firms such as Greggs. He boasted that he loved Cornish pasties in order to seize a public relations advantage after critics accused the Government of being out of touch with ordinary people. But his claims, at a Downing Street press conference, that he last ate a pasty at an outlet of the West Cornwall Pasty Company at Leeds station were quickly exposed as untrue. Network Rail revealed the West Cornwall outlet was closed down in March 2007 – five years ago to the month. And in further embarrassment for the PM, it emerged that a Cornish Bakehouse pasty booth on the northbound platform of the station was closed down on Friday – two days after the tax increase was announced. The Prime Minister’s alleged ‘porky pies’ were quickly branded ‘Pastygate’ in Westminster and provoked a feeding frenzy of exchanges. Mr Cameron was forced to speak out after anger caused by George Osborne’s appearance before the Treasury select committee on Tuesday. The Chancellor told MPs hot pasties that are cooled down before they are sold would not be subject to VAT, while hot pasties would be – and said he could not remember eating a Greggs product. Mr Cameron made an impassioned defence . of the plans, arguing they would create a level playing field between . bakers and pasty outlets, which are currently VAT exempt, and other fast . food joints such as McDonald’s and fish and chip shops, which have to . pay the tax. But he was caught out when he gave an . overly detailed account of his last pasty meal. ‘I’m a pasty eater . myself,’ he said at an event about the Olympics. ‘I go to Cornwall on . holiday. I love a hot pasty. Sausage drole: Ed Miliband shares a joke with Ed Balls and Rachel Reeves as they paid a visit to a Greggs outlet . Solidarity: The Labour leader shakes hands with staff at the branch of Greggs in Redditch, Worcestershire . ‘I think the last one I bought was from the West Cornwall Pasty Company. I seem to remember I was in Leeds station at the time. The choice was to have one of their small ones or their large ones. I’ve got a feeling I opted for the large one and very good it was too.’ But within minutes Network Rail had confirmed that Mr Cameron’s memory was faulty. Tory MPs privately compared Mr Cameron’s gaffe to that of Tony Blair, who was dogged for years by the apocryphal story that he claimed to have seen the Newcastle footballer Jackie Milburn play, when he had retired when Mr Blair was four years old. Labour raced to cash in on the Government’s embarrassment. Ed Miliband, shadow chancellor Ed Balls and treasury spokesman Rachel Reeves all attended a photo opportunity at a Greggs bakers in Redditch, Worcestershire. Labour aides gleefully told . journalists that Mr Miliband bought eight sausage rolls for £4.70 – . which will cost £5.64 when the tax is imposed in October. Mr . Miliband said: ‘The Government is now putting 20 per cent on the cost . of pasties, sausage rolls, and the Chancellor’s excuse? Well, he says . you can buy them cold and you can avoid the tax. It just shows how out . of touch this Government is and it shows that we’ve got a Budget that is . hitting millions of people while cutting taxes for millionaires.’ More . than 2,000 people signed a No 10 petition calling for ministers to axe . the tax and a company began selling T-shirts bearing the slogan Don’t . Tax My Pasty. Downing . Street officials rushed to assure the nation that while Mr Cameron may . have been caught out on the details, he is a firm pasty fan. ‘It’s a . near ritual on trips that the PM and his aides have an end-of-day pasty . on the train back,’ one said. Pasty . makers called on ministers to change their plans. Gavin Williams, of . the West Cornwall Pasty Company, thanked the PM for his endorsement but . added: ‘We would have hoped that if he had been rubbing shoulders with . our customers he’d better understand the impact that this move will have . on them, and our sector and all the great suppliers within it.’ Snack time: Between them the three politicians bought eight sausage rolls - with Mr Balls apparently enjoying the lion's share . Why the change? In the 1980s Tory Chancellor Nigel Lawson put VAT on hot food. But he exempted freshly baked products, such as pastries and pies, that were still warm from the bakery oven. George Osborne considered this a loophole that needed closing. What food is covered? All food – pasties, sausage rolls, toasted sandwiches and rotisserie chickens – that is sold hot in any shop will have to charge the 20 per cent sales tax. Hot takeaway restaurants and fish and chip shops already charge VAT. What’s the official definition of ‘hot’? The Treasury guide says food is hot if it is ‘above ambient air temperature when provided to the customer’. This seems pretty straightforward – until you consider the British weather, which has great variations in temperature throughout the year and in different parts of the country. So a sausage roll sold at 20c in summer would be below the ‘ambient air temperature’ and VAT-free. In the winter it would be warmer than the surrounding air and therefore liable for VAT. Equally perverse, if it was a hot and sunny day in the South and cold and wet in the North, customers would, in theory, pay different prices for the same sausage roll. To take this to its most absurd, someone waiting at the front of a queue for a fresh sausage roll might pay VAT because it is still hot, while someone at the back might pay less because it has gone cold. How will the taxman determine how much of the food sold is hot and how much cold? One possible solution is that revenue inspectors will consider factors that affect ‘ambient temperature’, such as local weather patterns and seasonal changes, and make a one-off annual assessment of what proportion of hot and cold items  a shop will sell over the period of  a year. They might decide, for example, that 60 per cent of sales are hot and 40 per cent cold. The retailer would then be given a VAT bill based on this calculation. How have takeaway food firms reacted? Sales at bakery chains such as Greggs and Subway have soared in recent years. But the new tax will mean many prices rising by 20 per cent and not surprisingly they are trying to force the Treasury into a rethink. They say food that is freshly baked on the premises and sold while still cooling down should continue to be free of VAT. It says these products should be treated differently tax-wise from food like burgers and kebabs which are designed to be served hot. Are there other practical difficulties? Bakers, supermarkets and even corner shops might need to spend extra money on new cabinets to keep separately hot items (which are VAT liable) and the same  cold product (which doesn’t attract VAT). Are there exemptions to the hot food tax? Yes. Freshly-baked bread (which is considered a basic food item) will not carry VAT. However, tax accountants predict a raft of court cases involving battles over the  exact definition of freshly- baked bread. For example, a loaf is easy to identify – but what about croissants, scones, pain au chocolat and other such products? How much will be raised from this extra VAT? Officials say the changes (which come into operation on October 1) will raise £50million in the current financial year, rising to £120million in 2016/7.

"It is the nation’s newest guessing game and has even sparked gambling fever: just who is the killer in new ITV series Broadchurch. As armchair sleuths try to solve this murder mystery puzzle, no doubt the show’s cast will have some sympathy. Because even they didn’t know the answer until the very last minutes of filming. Broadchurch tells the story of how a small community is affected by the death of a schoolboy whose body is found at the foot of a cliff. The cast of Broadchurch, starring David Tennant, were not told the culprit until the last moments of filming . It stars former Doctor Who David Tennant, Olivia Colman – who played Carol Thatcher in the film The Iron Lady – and Pauline Quirke from Birds Of A Feather. Writer Chris Chibnall was so determined to keep the climax a surprise that he kept his cast and crew in the dark for the whole of the five-month filming schedule – prompting a wild guessing game among them. Chibnall said: ‘We adopted the kind of security you’d normally associate with a massive Hollywood movie. All of the scripts on set were kept  in a safe, watermarked so they couldn’t be copied, and there were only five people, including myself, who knew the full story. ‘For 85 per cent of filming, no  one had any idea who was guilty. The cast and crew set up a rogues’ gallery and took bets on who they thought it was, but I was determined that secrecy was the key to the drama’s success.’ Finally revealing the answer to ‘whodunit?’ became a mini drama on its own. Chibnall, who also wrote the BBC hit Life On Mars, said: ‘As we were coming to the point where we had to give people final scripts, I organised for everyone to meet at the beach so that I could tell them. The first episode of Broadchurch, starring David Tennant and Olivia Colman, attracted seven million viewers . ‘But on set the night before, so many people admitted they liked the suspense and didn’t want to know who it was, that when I arrived I told them I’d changed my mind. ‘Olivia Colman, who plays one of the investigating police officers, looked like she was ready to murder me, while David Tennant grabbed hold of me and said he couldn’t believe I wasn’t going to tell him. But then he admitted he was actually glad.’ The actors were told on a ‘need-to-know’ basis a couple of days later in late-night phone calls just hours before they were due on set. Attempts to keep the plot shrouded in secrecy are continuing, with the series, which started on Monday, due to run for another seven episodes. Chibnall said: ‘Pauline Quirke called to say all her friends and  family are putting bets on, and I’ve heard countless similar stories in the past few days. ‘It seems people have become instantly caught up in the series.’ All preview copies of the series have been password-protected, with only a handful of people allowed access to them. Even ITV’s director of programmes, Peter Fincham, was kept in the dark until last week. Writer Chris Chibnall gathered cast on a beach to tell them the plot, but then changed his mind at the last minute . Chibnall said: ‘We aren’t even allowing the following week’s episode to be trailed at the end of the show because it might lead  to the secret being blown.’ The series attracted more than seven million viewers for the first episode last week. Now it looks set to win accolades as one of this year’s top dramas.  The story, set around the fictional Dorset town of Broadchurch, was filmed in the county at picturesque West Bay near Bridport. Broadchurch is on ITV1 tomorrow at 9pm. The West Bay in Dorset was used for the cult BBC sitcom The Fall And Rise Of Reginald Perrin, starring the late Leonard Rossiter . The seaside town of West Bay in Dorset, where Broadchurch was filmed, has been the backdrop to  a string of TV dramas. It earned its claim to fame in the Seventies when used for the faked . suicide scenes in the opening titles of cult BBC sitcom The Fall And . Rise Of Reginald Perrin, starring the late Leonard Rossiter. Then, in . 1999, the bay landed a more regular TV slot  when it became Bridehaven . in another BBC series, Harbour Lights, starring one-time heart-throb . Nick Berry as a harbour master. In real life, the bay is a favourite  for family holidays with amusement . arcades, ice-cream shops and a funfair. But the rugged cliffs and . thrashing seas are a reminder that the coastline has a more dangerous . side. Last year, 22-year-old Charlotte Blackman was killed by a rockfall . as she walked on the sands at nearby Burton Bradstock. Some locals . felt it was insensitive to use the coastline to film another tragedy, . albeit fictional, so soon after her death. ITV said it had consulted with the community before filming.","Writer Chris Chibnall kept series ending secret for five months of filming .

"An immediate rise in holiday bookings to Scotland has been recorded following the country's vote to remain part of the United Kingdom. Travel comparison and booking site GoEuro has revealed 4 per cent increase on Friday in bookings from England to Scotland following the 55 per cent to 45 per cent referendum vote against independence. With tourists from England shunning Scotland in the lead-up to the vote - Trivago.co.uk recorded a 29 per cent year-on-year drop in interest from the rest of the UK - it appears Scotland's Great British brothers and sisters are quick to forgive and forget. Scroll down for video . Back in demand: Scotland's most popular paid entry tourist attraction, Edinburgh Castle . Votes are in: After the 55 per cent to 45 per cent referendum vote in favour of pro-union campaigners (pictured), bookings to Scotland have risen immediately . The English were not alone in their keenness to reaffirm  ties with the Scots, with a 2.5 per cent increase in bookings via GoEuro overnight from Ireland. Nations with strong independence movements of their own, France and Spain, had revealed in a survey leading up to the vote that a yes decision would make Scotland a more attractive destination to them. However after the no vote the immediate response from the countries has been positive with bookings from Spain rising by 2 per cent and a 3.3 per cent boost from France. Germany, Netherlands and Belgium's interest in the country has remained stable. Boost: An immediate rise in bookings to Scotland has come with news of a no vote for independence . The most remarkable rise in interest has come from the United States, with their jump of 4.8 per cent for bookings to Scotland indicating many were awaiting the result of the referendum before booking their next break abroad. On Thursday, as Scotland went to the polls, some tourism operators said the uncertainty surrounding Scotland's future was unsettling English tourists who were cancelling holidays across the border in their droves. But since the polls of Scotland's 32 council areas recorded a result of 2,001,926 no votes to  1,617,989 yes votes, the country could be set for a tourism boom. Split: Industry experts expressed concern over the affect of independence would have on Scottish travel . 'Earlier this week, we polled thousands of GoEuro users across Europe, and the majority responded saying that an independent Scotland would be a less appealing holiday destination,' said GoEuro's Country Manager Pablo Martinez. 'The referendum result seems to confirm that a united Scotland could well be looking forward to more tourists than ever before. 'This morning's bookings through GoEuro suggest that a ""no"" vote, coupled with the exposure Scotland has had in the media over recent weeks, has increased number of bookings overnight, especially those from England, France and the US.' Scotland will be in the headlines again for less political reasons next week with the The Ryder Cup golf tournament taking place at Gleneagles in Perthshire between Europe and the United States, another possible catalyst for the surge in American bookings. Back in the spotlight: Gleneagles resort in Perthshire will host the Ryder Cup golf tournament next week . A statement from UK travel association ABTA after the vote was finalised soon after 6am on Friday welcomed the stability that came with the no vote but said there were still issues to be ironed out between the industry and the British government. 'Today's No vote brings to a close a protracted period of uncertainty, and means that travel companies and their customers can continue with the current regulatory and business systems,' ABTA said in a statement. 'Some of the travel issues raised during the independence debate, such as Air Passenger Duty and consumer protection, remain live issues, and ABTA will continue to engage with these on behalf of its Members in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom.'","Bookings from England to Scotland have risen after the independence vote .

The UK guideline is 6g a day. ‘More still needs to be done,’ said WASH spokeswoman Clare Farrand. Five steps to dodging strokes . Women can dramatically reduce their risk of stroke by adhering to the five factors that constitute a healthy lifestyle – a diet rich in fruit and vegetables, moderate alcohol consumption, not smoking, being physically active and having a Body Mass Index under 25. It is one of the most dreaded symptoms of the menopause: the embarrassing and uncomfortable hot flush. Now, researchers have suggested a morning cup of coffee could make them worse. Studies at US hospital The Mayo Clinic found 85 per cent of women surveyed who suffered hot flushes also consumed caffeine in tea, coffee and fizzy drinks, 20 per cent more than menopausal women as a whole. Researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden studied 32,000 women over a decade and found that those that stuck most closely to the regime had a 54 per cent lower risk of stroke.

"Whodunnit? He did: Joe Miller, played by actor Matthew Gravelle, was revealed as the killer of 11-year-old schoolboy Danny Latimer on the television programme . Almost 9million armchair sleuths tuned in to see Broadchurch’s dramatic final episode. But while the show started with 8.8million viewers, it tailed off to 7.9million after 15 minutes once Joe Miller was revealed as the killer of 11-year-old schoolboy Danny Latimer. The average figure for Monday’s show was 8.4million – more than a million up from last week’s 6.9million viewers. Even though his character was an unlikely suspect, actor Matthew Gravelle, who played Miller, says he was stopped on the school run yesterday morning by parents claiming they knew it was him all along. In fact the bigger surprise was the announcement of a second series. The episode ended with the caption ‘Broadchurch will return’. One viewer, Simon Bromley, tweeted: ‘I wasn’t expecting that.’ The eight-part drama starred David Tennant and Olivia Colman as detectives on the hunt for the killer of the 11-year-old schoolboy, whose body was found at the foot of a cliff in the picturesque Dorset village of Broadchurch. Viewers hit a peak of 9.3million on Monday as the murderer was . eventually revealed to be Joe Miller - . the husband of Colman's character, Detective Sergeant Ellie Miller. The . climax was kept such a closely guarded secret that only 29 people - all . of whom were cast, crew or executives - knew the identity of the killer . before the final episode, it was reported by The Guardian. Actor Matthew Gravelle, 37, admitted . he left it as late as possible to go on the school run after he was . revealed as the murderer. But parents were waiting at the schoolgates to see the TV killer in the flesh. Matthew . said: 'I tried to leave it as late as possible before running up to the . school and dropping the children off and running back. It's back: ITV have confirmed that the hit show will return to screens for a second series - but it may not involve a murder, it has emerged . Denouement: Joe Miller was revealed as the killer of Danny Latimer in the finale of the show, which gripped 10million . Olivia Lawrence: 'After watching the final episode of #Broadchurch I am emotionally drained. I feel absolutely exhausted!' Matthew Robb ‏: 'Broadchurch is the best drama i have ever seen on British TV. Production, Acting, Storyline, all top notch! #broadchurch.' Roman Lukyanov ‏: '#broadchurch should be left well alone. There is nowhere for a 2nd season to go. Unless its Tennant in Sandbrook, which could work.' Chloe Shields ‏: 'catching up on last nights broadchurch....wasnt expecting that #wow #shocker #broadchurch #itv . JohnHenryDictaphone: 'Argh! The last 10 minutes of #Broadchurch didn't need to happen.

Alan Carr: 'Must admit that massive asteroid landing on #broadchurch destroying the whole community was a bit of a lame ending.' Phillip Schofield: 'Wow #broadchurch' 'A couple of parents stopped me to let me know they had known it was me - but no one tried to push me over.' Former Holby City actor Matthew lives with his actress wife Mali Harries and their children Ela, eight, and Tomi, five, in Cardiff. And it was the confrontation in the playground which made him realise just how Broadchurch had affected the nine million viewers. Matthew said: 'Up until the point I was revealed as the killer I'd been a house-husband and general nice bloke. Now it is different.' Matthew admitted he has been left anxious after his character Joe Miller confessed to killing Danny Latimer. He was one of eight potential suspects in the ITV series which has gripped the nation. But Matthew only discovered he was the Broadchurch killer two weeks before the filming ended. The concluding episode drew an average . audience of 8.8 million viewers - a 33 per cent share of viewing, the . highest rating episode of the series by one million. Now ITV have confirmed the hit show will get a second series next year, but, as with the first, details of the story, . and which characters will return, are currently being kept tightly under . wraps. Since launching on March 4, the drama has become the biggest whodunnit of the year, attracting an average weekly audience of more than nine million. Ambushed in the playground: Matthew Gravelle, who played Joe Miller, said he was told by parents at his children's school today that they always knew his character was the killer . The first episode rating of 9.1million (31 per cent audience share) saw Broadchurch achieve the highest . weekday launch of a new drama across all broadcasters since ITV's . Whitechapel in January 2009. Only two other dramas on television . launching during weekday have rated higher since 2002, both from ITV, . Life Begins and Doc Martin. Based on live overnight data, .

"There are clips on YouTube of Erik Lamela slaloming his way past defences in the shirts of River Plate and Roma before he rifles the ball into the top corner. Lamela was widely regarded as one of the finest talents in world football when he joined Tottenham for a club record fee of £26million last summer. Since then, he has barely had a kick. Last month, when Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood was asked about the Argentine’s contribution this season, he claimed: ‘The jury is still out, if I’m honest.’ They were hardly words of reassurance. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Erik Lamela in the gym . Record buy: Erik Lamela was bought by Tottenham Hotspur last summer for a club record fee of £30 million . The truth is that Lamela, 22, was injured when he arrived and was so desperate to succeed that he hid a muscular injury following his move to the Barclays Premier League. His body compensated in other areas, eventually leading to the diagnosis of a fractured vertebra that has kept him out of a Tottenham shirt since a 15-minute substitute appearance in the 3-0 victory over Stoke on December 29. Since his move — when he was signed with seven other players in a  summer spending spree — he has made 10 starts, three in the Premier League. He has scored just once, in a Europa League tie against FC Sheriff. He impressed Spurs fans in that tie but his confidence was not helped when he was left out of the next game — a 1-0 home defeat by Newcastle — by Andre Villas-Boas. There have been other signs of his talent, including a clever last-minute assist for Paulinho’s winner at Cardiff. But inside he is hurting and is absolutely determined to make amends next season. A queue of clubs playing Champions League football next season would take Lamela off  Tottenham’s hands, but he isn’t leaving. Lack of action: Lamela has made just 10 starts for Tottenham Hotspur and has scored just once . He has five years left on his contract and intends to live up to his billing as one of the world’s best young players when the Premier League resumes on August 16. Lamela was happy to start a new life in London when he joined last summer, part of a progression that he mapped out in an interview with Transworld Sport when he was 12. He spoke of his ambition to leave Argentina to play in Italy, England and ‘preferably Spain because they speak the same language’. His failure to grasp the language is another issue, something . Sherwood referenced when Lamela returned to Rome to see specialists because his Italian is better than his English. Lack of backing: Tottenham Hotspur manager Tim Sherwood has hardly provided reassurance for Lamela . In the early phase of his Tottenham career, as he adapted to his new life and the Hampstead home he shares with his girlfriend, he was still coming to terms with the language. Lamela knows that after a year in England, a country he always had ambitions to play in when he was growing up with dad Jose and mum Miriam, that he should have a  better handle on it. Off the field he is shy and introverted, spending time with his girlfriend and learning to love their quiet London life. His lack of playing time has come at a cost, with him missing out on a place in Alejandro Sabella’s Argentina squad for the World Cup. Staying in: Lamela's lack of action has seen him miss out on a place in the Argentina World Cup squad . But Lamela has been motivated by Sherwood and the manager’s implied criticism before Tottenham’s Premier League clash with Fulham on April 19. Asked if he was coming under pressure from Tottenham’s hierarchy to play Lamela (he was injured anyway), this was Sherwood’s spiky response: ‘The chance would be a fine thing. He’s never been fit. He’s an unknown quantity as far as I’m concerned.’ At the start of the season Lamela wanted to impress Villas-Boas, to continue the rich vein of goalscoring form that convinced chairman Daniel Levy he was capable of replacing Gareth Bale. In his final season at the Stadio Olimpico, former Roma coach Zdenek Zeman made a subtle tactical tweak to his game and asked him to switch wings. He would cut in from the right on to his favoured left boot and ping balls into the penalty area for Daniele De Rossi, Francesco Totti or Miralem Pjanic. Former gaffer: Lamela signed for Tottenham Hotspur when Andre Villas-Boas was still in charge . It worked and he scored 15 times in 33 Serie A appearances as Roma finished the season in sixth place. There’s an assumption that Lamela was recommended to Spurs by their director of football Franco Baldini when he quit Roma to take up a similar position at Tottenham last summer. In fact they made their first approach in January 2013, when Villas-Boas enquired about him in the transfer window. After such a long courtship, he is under pressure to create a stir at Spurs. He needs to do it soon. ERIK LAMELA - £30m Roma to Tottenham . Arrived as one of the brightest young talents in Europe but is now a forgotten man. ANDREAS CORNELIUS - £8.5m FC Copenhagen to Cardiff . The striker played 11 times, scored no goals and was sold at a huge loss. IAGO ASPAS - £7.5m Celta Vigo to Liverpool . One of seven Anfield signings last summer but the striker has scored only once.

Big move: Marouane Fellaini followed David Moyes (right) from Everton to United but it has not worked out . RICKY van WOLFSWINKEL - £8.6m Sporting to Norwich .

"A crane flipped over and came crashing down while removing a tree near Tampa Bay, Florida, Sunday, damaging a home, smashing an RV and three parked vehicles. The Pinellas County Sheriff's Office says the crane operator jumped to safety when the heavy machinery he was using to uproot a storm-damaged tree on Dream Way in Largo started to tip over just after 11.30am. No significant injuries were reported. The crane did not damage the property of the Largo homeowner who needed the tree removed. Scroll down for video . Wreckage: This RV was crushed when a crane being used to remove a tree tipped over in Largo, Florida, Sunday . Smash-up: The boom of the crane came down on top of this parked car, which was unoccupied at the time . Path of destruction: Besides the RV, the toppled crane also damaged a house and three vehicles . However, the crane fell on top of three nearby cars and a 2011 camper, and took down a light pole. Deputies say the fall also caused severe damage to a neighboring home. It took work crews several hours to pull the battered crane from under the debris and upright it. Eyewitness Chett Razey captured on his cellphone the heart-pounding moment the crane tipped over. 'Before I knew it, it took out a couple of vehicles and a trailer,' he told WFLA. Dramatic footage: Eyewitness Chett Razey had his cellphone camera rolling during the tree removal . Tipped over: The video shows the moment the crane began tipping forward, weighed down by its boom hoisting a chunk of the tree . Near miss: The operator of the crane was able to jump out of the cabin just in time, suffering only minor scrapes . One of the people who were affected by the incident was Largo resident Jeffrey Claus, whose house and van were damaged by the boom of the falling crane. The rented crane was being operated by Danny Tomas, an employee of a St Petersburg-based company called Sustainable Tree care, who escaped the cabin with only a few minor scrapes. Tomas was using the crane to remove a tree on the property of Melinda Jenkins, 50, at 9115 Dream Way, after it was damaged during a recent storm, which caused it to collapse onto the roof of her house. According to neighbor Sandra Beard, who suffered property damage as a result of the accident, the crane crash marked a very close call for her family. Homeowner Melinda Jenkins hired a St Petersburg-based company to remove this tree from her yard after it was damaged during a recent storm . Culprit: The Sunday crane accident took place during the removal of this battered tree . Beard explained that her son and grandchildren were standing near the crane just before it plummeted to the ground. ‘They were all playing out here watching them cut the tree,' she said. 'They had just asked by son to move the van and then the crane fell on it.’ The sheriff’s department have launched an investigation to determine the cause of the collapse.","Accident took place on Dream Way in Largo, Florida, Sunday .

"The mother of two young children who were allegedly choked to death by their father wept in court today as she told of how she had trusted her ex-husband to care for them.

"Fordham University's Bronx, New York campus was full of proud parents this weekend, celebrating the class of 2014's graduation. But one parent was noticeably missing - Prince Albert II of Monaco. While his daughter Jazmin Grace Grimaldi was getting her degree on Saturday, Prince Albert  was attending a fashion show in Monte Carlo. Where's dad? While his daughter was graduating from Fordham University on Saturday, Prince Albert II of Monaco was attending a Louis Vuitton fashion show with his wife, Princess Charlene . Royal ties: Jazmin Grace Grimaldi is Prince Albert's illegitmate daughter from a brief romance with American Tamara Rotolo. Pictured above at a New York film premiere in May . Celebration: Jazmin graduated from Fordham University on May 17, and her dad wasn't around to take any snaps of her in her cap and gown. A picture from the May ceremony, above . On one of the most important days of his daughter's life, Albert was pictured smiling alongside wife Princess Charlene at a Louis Vuitton fashion show. Arguably, Jazmin's graduation had bad timing as it corresponded with the annual Cannes Film Festival which runs from May 14 - 25 and Albert attends the nearby festival every year. But Albert's absense at the graduation is just the latest sting in his shaky relationship with Jazmin, his illegitimate daughter from a brief romance with American Tamara Rotolo. Rotolo met the prince at a tennis tournament during a three-week vacation in the French Riviera in 1991. According to People, the couple stayed in touch on her return to the U.S. when she learned of the pregnancy but the Prince then cut off contact when she gave birth. Rotolo managed to force the paternity issue in 1993 when the Prince visited Cody, Wyoming, and she confronted him with their 17-month-old daughter. On Tuesday Albert attended a Charity Soccer match between Formula One drivers and a Star Team made of former and current sports stars at the Louis ll stadium in Monaco . It is unknown if his daughter inherited his sports prowess . Famous family: Grace Kelly, the mother of Jazmin's father Prince Albert of Monaco, is seen here in a portrait from the early 1950s . Just like a regular teenager: Jazmin is pictured with mother Tamara Rotolo graduating from middle school in 2006, just after Albert II confirmed he is her father . Prince Albert, who also has 10-year-old son Alexandre Coste out of wedlock, eventually confirmed he was Jazmin’s father on June 1, 2006 when she was 14, but said he had wanted to protect her identity until she was an adult. That same year the then-teenager went on a humanitarian mission to Fiji and donated 30,000 prenatal vitamins to a hospital, as well as visiting a school for the disabled. Prince Albert has since married Princess Charlene of Monaco and Jazmin attended the Princess Grace Awards in October 2012 with her father and stepmother. Lately, Jazmin has been stepping more and more into the spotlight. Earlier this month, Jazmin walked the red carpet at the New York premiere of the film The Immigrant, and also attended the Hoolywood Reporter's 35 Most Powerful People in Media celebration in April. While Jazmin's film star grandmother Grace Kelly was American, her father Albert and his sisters Caroline and Stephanie were raised in Monaco, as were Jazmin's cousins. Years ago Albert II, who is now 56, told Paris Match that Jazmin was welcome to live in Monaco and added of his two children: ‘What matters to me is they are certain of my affection for them.’ While the illegitimate status of her birth means Jazmin has no rights over the Monaco crown, she will inherit her portion of her father's huge fortune. She's becoming a pro at this: The 22-year-old attended the Hollywood Reporter 35 Most Powerful People In Media Celebration last month .

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has criticised the sacking of Tim Sherwood and claimed the high turnover of managers will affect the quality of the Premier League. Tottenham boss Sherwood became the second Premier League manager to lose his job this week, following West Brom's decision to part company with Pepe Mel on Monday. Wenger is the longest-serving manager in the Premier League and has outlasted 10 permanent Spurs bosses since his appointment in 1996. VIDEO Scroll down to hear Arsene Wenger criticise the quick rotation of managers . Sad: Arsene Wenger has voiced his disappointment in the sacking of Tim Sherwood (right) by Tottenham . Secure: Wenger is the longest-serving manager in the Premier League, having been at Arsenal since 1996 . During . his six months in charge at White Hart Lane, Sherwood pleaded to be . given the time to develop Tottenham into a side capable of challenging . Arsenal for a place in the top four but was dismissed after delivering a . sixth-placed finish. Rather . than bask in the failure of another Spurs manager, Wenger instead . chose to highlight the high turnover of managers and warned Arsenal's . north London rivals that they are stifling their own progress by . changing manager so often. He . said: 'Tottenham manager or any other manager, it's always sad when . someone loses their job. The worrying thing is the rotation of managers . is very good and that is not good. 'I believe technical stability is important for the quality of the game.' Clapping him off: Sherwood wanted the chance to develop Spurs but instead was sacked after six months . Wenger also revealed that nothing had changed regarding the future of Bacary Sagna, but believes the player is focused enough to play for Arsenal in the FA Cup final against Hull on Saturday. Sagna's contract expires at the end of the season and he has been linked with Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea all linked but Wenger has not given up hope of convincing the France international to remain at the club. He said: 'I have told you many times. The ball is in his court.' Asked if he had any doubts about selecting him against Hull at Wembley, Wenger added: 'None at all. I don't doubt his integrity or commitment.' In doubt: Bacary Sagna has been linked with a move to Man City, Liverpool and Chelsea .
