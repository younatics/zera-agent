"The University of Colorado Boulder has announced a discovery 7,200 miles above Earth of a protective shield similar to the force fields you might see in ""Star Trek."" The discovery of this barrier in the Van Allen radiation belts suggests a new explanation for how ""killer electrons"" are held at bay. This invisible shield, which was found at the inner edge of the outer Van Allen belt, protects against high-energy electrons, which have the potential to fry satellites, threaten astronauts and degrade space systems during intense solar storms. ""It's almost like these electrons are running into a glass wall in space,"" said Daniel Baker, director of CU-Boulder's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space. ""Somewhat like the shields created by force fields on 'Star Trek' that were used to repel alien weapons, we are seeing an invisible shield blocking these electrons. It's an extremely puzzling phenomenon."" The phenomenon challenges existing theories that these electrons drift into the upper atmosphere and are destroyed by air molecules. ""It's like looking at the phenomenon with new eyes, with a new set of instrumentation, which give us the detail to say, 'Yes, there is this hard, fast boundary,' "" said John Foster, associate director of MIT's Haystack Observatory and a study co-author. Does this have any potential for scientific innovation into force fields on Earth? Only time will tell, of course.","An invisible shield has been discovered 7,200 miles above Earth .

"Thousands of American Indians are now in line to receive part of a $3.4 billion settlement with the federal government, ending a long-running dispute over government mismanagement of tribal lands and accounts. After an initial agreement was outlined in 2009, Congress approved it in November 2010 and it spent the last two years going through an appeals process. It was finalized Saturday, with government officials announcing and touting it on Monday. ""I welcome the final approval of the Cobell settlement agreement, clearing the way for reconciliation between the trust beneficiaries and the federal government,"" President Barack Obama said in a statement. The settlement is named after the late Elouise Cobell, a member of Montana's Blackfeet Indian tribe. The deal follows a class-action lawsuit, filed in 1996, which accused the U.S. Department of the Interior of failing to account for and provide revenue from a trust fund representing the value of Indian assets managed by the government. The missing funds at the center of the class-action case involve what are called Individual Indian Money accounts, which are supposed to represent the property of individual Indians. The accounts are held by the United States as trustee. The lawsuit had accused the government of failing to account for the money, failing to make proper payments, and converting tribal money for the government's own use. In making the announcement Monday, Obama remembered Cobell for ""her honorable work."" In 2009, she said that many represented in the class-action lawsuit ""subsist in the direst poverty,"" and that the settlement is ""significantly less than the full amount to which the Indians are owed."" ""It's not fair,"" Cobell said then of the long process to reach a settlement, but ""in the future we may be treated more fairly."" The agreement calls for $1.5 billion to be distributed among those who were part of the lawsuit. Another $1.9 billion will go into a ""land consolidation program"" that will allow people to sell fractions of land they own, which are slivers of once larger ancestral plots that have been divided and subdivided over generations. The group ownership of land by American Indians dates back more than 100 years, before American Indians were permitted to write wills. As a result, the government says many pieces of tribal lands are held by many owners -- possibly hundreds, if not thousands of people per parcel. Officials have said the project allows individual landowners to receive greater value for their share, while cutting administrative costs for the federal government, which manages the Indian land trust. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said he hopes the agreement helps the government and American Indians turn the page on the ordeal. ""With the settlement now final, we can put years of discord behind us and start a new chapter in our nation-to-nation relationship,"" he said. Who's a Native American? It's complicated .

"The FBI on Tuesday asked for the public's help in identifying an English-speaking militant who appeared to help execute Syrian soldiers in an ISIS recruitment video released last month. In the 55-minute video titled ""Flames of War,"" the jihadist switches from classical Arabic to perfect English with a North American accent, and appears to orchestrate a mass execution of Syrian soldiers. The FBI reached out to the public on its website Tuesday, posting a portion of the video and asking whether anyone has information about the jihadist's identity. ""We're hoping that someone might recognize this individual and provide us with key pieces of information,"" Michael Steinbach, assistant director of the FBI's counterterrorism division, said Tuesday. The request is part of the FBI's broader outreach to the public to help identify people seeking to travel overseas to fight with terror groups, and those who are returning from such fights. U.S. intelligence officials have been trying to analyze the recruitment featuring the English-speaking jihadist. Officials see the killer's appearance in the video as significant because he comes across, they say, as articulate and persuasive, a person of influence within the terror group. In the video, there are a number of men digging a ditch behind him. The jihadist, whose face is covered except for his eyes, claims they are Syrian soldiers assigned to a 17th Division military base near the Syrian city of Raqqa, and who, after an ISIS attack, were ""digging their own graves in the very place where they were stationed."" CNN cannot independently verify that the men in the video were soldiers, as the propaganda video claims. The video then shows the speaker and a group of militants executing the men, who fall into the ditch. The man who led this atrocity on film could be an Arab who was educated in the West. Or he could be an American or Canadian. If so, CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said, he would be the first North American jihadist to commit a war crime on camera. ""Clearly ISIS had a calculated step to be able to put this guy on camera,"" said Frank Cilluffo, a security analyst at George Washington University. ""Why? Because he seems American. The message is aimed at a Western audience."" On Sunday, FBI Director James Comey told CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that his agency is tracking a dozen Americans that have joined terrorist groups inside Syria. ""These homegrown violent extremists are troubled souls who are seeking meaning in some misguided way, and so they come across the propaganda, and they become radicalized on their own, sort of independent study, and they're also able to equip themselves with training, again, through the Internet,"" Comey told CBS. ""And then engage in jihad after emerging from their basement."" Last month, federal authorities detailed their case against the owner of a New York food store who they accused of funding ISIS and plotting to gun down U.S. troops who had served in Iraq. A law enforcement official told CNN that former Boston resident and U.S. citizen Ahmad Abousamra could be a key player in the ISIS social media machine that's become renowned in recent weeks for spewing brutal propaganda online -- messages meant both to terrify and recruit Westerners. And CNN obtained tapes of American terrorists recruiting friends in the United States to join terror groups like ISIS. ISIS has successfully recruited large numbers of foreign fighters from across the globe, including from the United States and Western Europe. A CIA source told CNN last month that more than 15,000 foreign fighters, including 2,000 Westerners, had gone to the civil war in Syria. It was not immediately clear how many had joined ISIS and how many were with other groups opposed to the Syrian government. The foreign fighters come from more than 80 countries, the CIA source said. A top State Department official insisted Monday that American efforts to combat ISIS' powerful online message are working, successfully keeping disaffected youth from joining the extremist group. ""We have evidence that there are young people who are not joining because we have somehow interceded,"" Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs Richard Stengel told CNN's Elise Labott on Monday. ""They're reading the messages, they're hearing the messages -- not just from us but from the hundreds of Islamic clerics who have said that this is a perversion of Islam, from the hundreds of Islamic scholars who have said the same thing."" ""It's a very small cohort,"" Stengel said of these so-called ""foreign fighter"" cases originating from the United States.","FBI seeks public's help in identifying English-speaking militant .

"A year after Republicans were criticized for playing a major role in the government shutdown, the chairman of the Republican National Committee gave a big speech Thursday in an attempt to tear away at the party's obstructionist image. ""People know what we're against. I want to talk about the things we're for,"" Reince Priebus said Thursday at George Washington University. The speech was part of the Republican Party's rebranding effort following its 2012 presidential election loss, in which GOP nominee Mitt Romney lost to President Obama in large part because of his weak standing with minorities, young voters and women. Priebus was critical of the way the party operated nationally in the past, saying the GOP had simply become a ""U-haul trailer of cash for a presidential nominee"" once every four years -- an approach he called a ""loser strategy."" He stressed that the party needs to be ""obsessed over the mechanics"" of voter outreach efforts, especially in the data and digital fields. ""We also have become a midterm party that doesn't lose and presidential party that doesn't win,"" he said, attributing the pattern to a lack of voter engagement and on-the-ground work. ""There's something that goes on in presidential elections that we have to get our act together and that's what we're going to do,"" he continued. He ticked off 11 topics that he said are ""driving the Republican Party"" -- a policy list that included health care, the economy, national security, and immigration. Priebus named a number of Republican lawmakers in Washington and governors who have proposed or enacted legislation that would address poverty, education and energy. Among them were Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, and Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico and House Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, chairwoman of the House Republican Conference. ""One election won't fix everything, but we can take a step in the right direction this November,"" he said. ""If the American people hire us, we'll be ready on day one."" The Democratic National Committee, which had staffers at the speech, knocked Priebus' remarks as simply recycled material. ""Reince Priebus just wrapped up his third rebrand speech for the GOP (not to be confused with his earlier rebrand speech or the one before that) but all we heard was the same old rhetoric that is out of step with reality,"" the DNC said in an email blast.â€‹ .","RNC Chair Reince Priebus wants the party to lose its obstructionist image .

"Statuary Hall inside the Capitol is the storied site of many key moments in U.S. history -- from heated debates about slavery to inaugural lunches with presidents. But Statuary Hall has almost surely never hosted a departing lawmaker rapping for national TV -- that is until Michele Bachmann gave us her now famous rendition of the hip-hop song ""Thrift Shop"" by Macklemore. ""I look incredible. I wear your granddad's clothes. I got twenty dollars in my pocket, and I'm going to the thrift shop down the road,"" Bachmann, rapped, moving her body to the beat for effect. It is hard to believe this is the same Bachmann who sprung onto the political scene shaking her fist in the air on the Capitol steps, rallying tea party protesters against President Barack Obama's policies. ""I wasn't politically correct, and I wasn't as worried about my own political career,"" she said. ""I was really worried about the issues of the country. And what I was doing, I think, was just giving voice to what I would do if I was a mom back home."" This is Bachmann unplugged, as she exits stage right after four terms in Congress, eager to show that she can lighten up while still sticking to conservative principles. ""Nobody has to worry about competition from me, I'll tell you that!"" Bachmann jokes about her rapping, which she said she learned from her 27-year-old son Harrison during a family trip last spring. RELATED: Bachmann touts the 10 Commandments in final speech . Bachmann has been one of the most polarizing politicians of the last five years -- and few news organizations have held her feet to the fire about controversial comments more than CNN. Anderson Cooper's ""Keeping Them Honest"" segment had its hands full with Bachmann statements to fact check. We personally spent many a long day walking the Capitol hallways trying to find Bachmann to ask her tough questions -- most famously about her comments about frivolous presidential spending, like on a dog walker, that turned out not to be true. But now that she is on her way out of politics, we thought it would be interesting to get to know Bachmann beyond her big political persona. Entering the Spotlight . It is hard to believe Bachmann has only been in Congress for eight years. But she made national headlines sooner than most backbenchers by embracing the tea party movement and becoming a de facto leader during the financial crisis. ""When I first came in, one of the first things that I did is I took on the president of my own party, George W. Bush, because George Bush wanted to pass a $700 billion bailout for Wall Street,"" she recalled explaining her ""no"" vote for the bill. ""We were in a completely different realm that doesn't even make sense anymore, these numbers that we're talking about. $700 billion is a lot of money! And so I asked the question, where did you get that figure from? And number two, what are you going to use it for? And I couldn't get good answers."" She jokes that she doesn't know who is more excited to see her go, Democrats or her fellow GOP leaders. ""I don't know who's going to miss me more when I leave Congress -- Nancy Pelosi or John Boehner -- I have no idea! I've been a thorn, I think, in both of their sides,"" Bachmann said. Sexism in politics . Bachmann is eager to note that she was the only GOP woman to run for president in 2012, and says sexism is still very prevalent in politics. ""I'll be frank with you -- the way that I see it is that I think that when women speak, I don't think that we're listened to the same way that a man does. I know that I -- I'm in a lot of venues where I'm the only woman. The only woman."" ""One thing that I notice is that when I walk into the room, the men are talking to each other -- when I arrive -- they'll talk to each other when I'm leaving, and I'll go up to them to try and get into the group and talk with them, but it's different. It's just different,"" she admitted. Bachmann and Jimmy Carter . In her final days in office, Bachmann took her family to a place in Washington Republicans don't visit: the White House. She scrounged around the capitol for extra tickets from colleagues not planning to attend the annual Christmas party, so that she could bring all five of her children to see President Obama for the holidays. Not surprisingly, she advised her kids to make their moments with the President count. ""I told them, look, you only get about a second with him,"" she recalled. ""Make sure whatever you say is exactly what's in your mind."" Her initial political experience was not working for Ronald Reagan, as one would think, but on Jimmy Carter's campaign. ""The first time I ever came to this city was to dance at the inaugural ball for Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale! Which is kind of hard to believe. But then I saw how their policies worked out, they were a complete and utter failure, and then that's why I became a Republican, and I never looked back,"" Bachmann said. The Frustrated Landscaper . In a lighthearted lightening round of questions, Bachmann said her theme song is ""Takin' Care Of Business"" by Bachmann-Turner Overdrive, naturally. Who does she want to play her in a biopic? ""Kristin Wiig,"" who played Bachmann in Saturday Night Live skits. If she could ask her musical idol Johnny Cash one question what would it be? ""Ah, would you please sing at my next birthday party! That's what I would say -- not gonna happen! -- but I do love him."" What is Bachmann's non-political reading material of choice? ""My favorite thing is landscaping. I love landscaping. And so what I'll do is, mostly I put language into search engines, and if I want to look, like, at tulip gardens, or, like, Georgian gardens,"" she said sheepishly. ""I love English gardens, how they're laid out. Japanese gardens, Asian gardens. So, I'm kind of a frustrated landscaper."" Mistakes, Congress and beyond . Bachmann admits she ""made mistakes"" during her time on Capitol Hill. No doubt repeating some erroneous facts in conservative media about the cost of presidential trips, or ties Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin's family had to Al Qaeda. Some of those comments drew attention from reporters like yours truly, who tried to walk as fast as she could in heels to ask questions. ""That is one of the things I really like -- I run stairs here. When we go, like, from the basement up, I'll be in high heels and I'll run the stairs because, the good thing is -- you actually do get a workout, cause you can walk seven miles a day here, plus do the stairs,"" Will she miss us chasing after her? ""Oh, of course I will,"" she said with a knowing laugh. Though she may be leaving Congress, there is no way she going far from the political spotlight, whatever her next act may be. ""Well I'll be involved in 2016 one way or another,"" she said shermanesquely. ""I am not looking at being a candidate, but I fully intend to be involved. This is a huge election where now we are tee'd up, both in the House and in the Senate, for the repeal of Obamacare."" ""When I ran for president in 2012, that was my motivation - I wanted to repeal Obamacare... I think that there will be a lot of momentum for that in 2016, and I want to be a part of that voice to help that happen,"" she said.","Rep.

"(CNN)Mike Huckabee is thinking about running for the presidency a second time. He's super serious about it. You can tell because not only has he quit his TV show to spend time thinking about it, and written a book (""God, Guns, Grits and Gravy,"" due out on January 20), but he's also booked a tour of Israel. Next to New Hampshire, Jerusalem might be the best place to run a hotel at election time. We should be serious about Huckabee too. As Aaron Blake points out in The Washington Post, when he ran in the 2008 Republican primaries, he not only took Iowa but swept much of the South as well -- scooping more than 20% of all the votes cast nationwide. Blake attributes this to Huckabee's unusual appeal within the evangelical community, which is linked to Huckabee's previous role as a preacher. For sure, there was a regional pattern to the vote. But he also had a tremendous potential that went unrealized in '08. Huckabee quit early due to a shortage of cash, so we never got to see how well he could run in a great number of states. Moreover, his early performances were hindered by the candidacy of Fred Thompson -- a dour, sour old stick who only seemed to be in the race to hurt Huckabee. It's fair to say that Thompson denied Huckabee a win in South Carolina and thus the momentum he needed to go the distance. The strange bitterness of the Thompson vs. Huckabee fight is a reminder that the Republican Party is far more philosophically diverse than the Democratic alternative. Huckabee is loathed by conservatives of a more libertarian, anti-state hue. They suspect that he is a big-government conservative. By that they mean a ruthless populist who will spend money to buy votes while keeping die-hard conservatives on board with appeals to religious prejudice. A more generous interpretation is that Huckabee was a Republican elected to office in a traditionally Democratic state (Arkansas) which also had a serious poverty problem. He eschewed low-tax, anti-government rhetoric in favor of spending money in the interests of the common good -- a cautious, rational position that is widely regarded as philosophically conservative everywhere but at the wealthy think tanks of Washington. The libertarian Reason magazine provides a list of Huckabee quotes intended to damn him, including one in which he describes their anti-tax agenda as ""a heartless, callous, soulless type of economic conservatism because it says 'look, we want to cut taxes and eliminate government. If it means that elderly people don't get their Medicare drugs, so be it. If it means little kids go without education and healthcare, so be it.' Well, that might be a quote pure economic conservative message, but it's not an American message. ... That's not historic Republicanism. Historic Republicanism does not hate government; it's just there to be as little of it as there can be."" Huckabee's analysis is historically accurate and canny. Americans may have a cultural distrust of large government in general, but polls and election returns suggest they still favor those parts of state activity that benefit them personally. And why not? If the state were to shrivel up to nothing, the result would not be conservative as much as anarchic. Those who wish to preserve family, tradition and the American way have little to gain from unleashing the full forces of amoral, unrestrained capitalism. Free markets do not respect God. For instance, did deregulation of the banking sector really result in rugged individualism and families flourishing free from the state? Or did it wreck the economy, tearing apart communities and triggering even greater political demand for government intervention? Chaos often excuses authoritarianism. The libertarian might say that this argument is liberal in Republican clothing -- but, again, it's a matter of what kind of society people are trying to preserve. Huckabee would likely not use the state for progressive causes as the Democrats would, but for conservative ones. And what makes him such a compelling candidate is his unique ability to articulate that right-wing vision. It was his debate performances that pushed him to the front of the 2008 pack, when he gave a defense of marriage, life and biblical teachings that suggested he was a Christian without being angry about it. Most Republicans who talk about social conservatism come off as either fanatical or disingenuous. Huckabee seemed normal. Such an ability to sell conservative ideas with a glimmer of humanity hasn't been seen since Ronald Reagan. Will it work again in 2016? Maybe. Huckabee faces the problem that the social-conservative field is crowded, already containing both Rick Santorum and Ted Cruz. Media attention and intellectual excitement might be focused on Jeb Bush and Rand Paul. And if Chris Christie runs, then frankly, the field will have another blue-collar, ordinary-person candidate of above-average size (a matter that Huckabee has tried to cash in on with a book). But none of these men has Huckabee's unique ability to speak through the television cameras and straight to the viewer at home. And, aside from Santorum, none of them has run for the nomination before. Republicans are typically cautious voters who encourage a candidate to run twice, or even thrice, before nominating them: Mitt Romney, John McCain, Bob Dole, George H.W. Bush and Reagan were all veterans of the presidential primaries. As such, Huckabee enters this race with a key asset: He's a conservative statesman. His history alone ought to guarantee him top-tier status.","Timothy Stanley:  Mike Huckabee mulling 2016 run; Americans should get serious about him .

"As partisans argued pointedly over same-sex marriage outside the U.S. Supreme Court, justices inside hinted at their disparate views on the hot-button issue -- though it's far from clear how they will rule. The stakes, though, are decidedly clearer. In the case argued Tuesday and another to be heard on Wednesday, the nine justices could fundamentally alter how American law treats marriage. On one extreme, the court could extend a constitutional right for gays and lesbians to wed in all 50 states. On the other, it could deal a major setback to the gay rights movement. And then there are options in between. ""This was a deeply divided Supreme Court, and a court that seemed almost to be groping for an answer here,"" said CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin. Hear and read the arguments in full . Toobin was among those who followed 80 minutes of arguments Tuesday over California's Proposition 8, which bans same-sex marriage. Voters approved the proposal 52% to 48% in November 2008, less than six months after the state Supreme Court ruled marriage is a fundamental right that must be extended to same-sex couples. The overriding legal question in the California case, Hollingsworth v. Perry (12-144), is whether the Constitution's 14th Amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law prevents states from defining marriage as that state has. From their questioning, it appeared evident how a few justices were leaning. Four of the more liberal justices seemed at least open to the idea that same-sex marriage should be allowed in California. Three of the more conservative justices seemed aligned with the view that it should only be for a man and a woman, and it's likely they'd be joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, who doesn't speak at arguments. That could leave Justice Anthony Kennedy as, has often been the case, the swing vote. He was among those who weighed in on whether the advocacy group appointed to defend the initiative has standing to argue the case. While admitting the law's defenders are ""not just any citizens,"" Kennedy raised concerns about whether just the possibility of same-sex marriage was enough to establish they had suffered harm -- a key jurisdictional hurdle allowing them to appeal in the first place. Key questions answered . Justice Sonia Sotomayor said it is the state's responsibility -- through its elected leaders -- to defend laws in court, and that private individuals could not establish ""how their injury was separate from everyone else."" California Attorney General Kamala Harris, the state's top lawyer, said Tuesday she ""declined to defend Proposition 8 because it violates the Constitution."" If the court dismisses the appeal on the grounds its defenders don't have the standing to defend the case in court, it may mean lower federal court rulings declaring the proposition unconstitutional would stand. But it wouldn't allow for a broader, final rule outlining the power of states to say who can or can't get married. Announcement of rulings unlikely before June . The justices did probe that broader legal question, including an exchange between pro-Proposition 8 attorney Charles Cooper and Justice Elena Kagan. ""The concern is that redefining marriage as a genderless institution will sever its abiding connection to its historic traditional procreative purposes, and it will ... refocus the purpose of marriage and the definition of marriage away from the raising of children and to the emotional needs and desires ... of adult couples,"" Cooper argued. To which Kagan said: ""Mr. Cooper, suppose a state said that, because 'we think that the focus of marriage really should be on procreation, we are not going to give marriage licenses anymore to any couple where both people are over the age of 55.' Would that be constitutional?"" ""No, your honor, it would not be constitutional,"" Cooper replied. Tuesday's hearing was the first of back-to-back sessions on same-sex marriage laws. The court will listen to arguments on Wednesday on U.S. v. Windsor, a separate challenge to the federal Defense of Marriage Act which, like the California law, defines marriage as between a man and a woman. That 1996 law prevents legally married same-sex couples from getting federal benefits and privileges, like tax breaks and survivor benefits, that are extended to opposite-sex couples. Couple at the center of epic high court fight . The court is unlikely to announce its decisions on both matters until June. Andrew Pugno, general counsel for the Protect Marriage Coalition, the group defending Proposition 8, said its attorney had ""credibly presented the winning case for marriage."" ""We think the hearing went very well,"" he told reporters. Attorneys representing the two couples seeking to overturn Proposition 8, meanwhile, said they couldn't tell how the court would rule. ""We are confident where the American people are going with this,"" said Theodore Olson. ""We don't know for sure what the United States Supreme Court is going to do, but we're very, very grateful they listened, they heard, they asked hard questions, and there's no denying where the right is."" Spirited rallies on both sides of debate . One of the plaintiff couples -- Paul Katami and Jeff Zarrillo of Burbank, California, who want to marry but can't because of Proposition 8 -- contend the state is discriminating against them because of their sexuality. ""This is about our freedom and our liberty,"" Katami said. ""We are not trying to topple marriage. We are not trying to redefine marriage. What we are trying to say is that equality is the backbone of our country."" This view was echoed by fellow same-sex marriage supporters, who rallied outside the court with the hope that the justices would eventually issue a broad ruling to strike down bans nationwide. 5 turning points in the debate . ""We are not asking for anything more than our neighbors, friends and family, but certainly expect no less,"" said Todd Bluntworth, who spoke with his husband and their two children. But opponents who rallied nearby -- some of them carrying signs reading, ""Kids do best with a mom & dad"" -- urged the court to keep out of the issue and leave the decision to states. ""If you want to get married, go to one of the states that allows gay marriage,"" said Carl Boyd Jr., a conservative Nashville talk-show host. ""Stop trying to force your agenda down our throats. Quit trying to bully the American people with the homosexual agenda."" Patchwork state laws . The court could historically alter how the law treats marriage, striking down laws across the country banning same-sex marriage and matching an apparent cultural shift toward acceptance of same-sex couples. Or it could leave the current patchwork of state laws in place, choosing to let state legislatures and state courts sort it all out. Forty-one states now forbid same-sex marriage, although nine of them allow civil partnerships. Nine other states allow same-sex marriage, and about 120,000 same-sex couples have gotten married, according to estimates. By the numbers: Same-sex marriage . California's ban seems to run counter to polls that show rising support overall for same-sex marriage. A CNN/ORC International poll released on Monday found 53% of Americans now support same-sex marriage, up from 40% in 2007. As to how the federal government should handle the issue -- the subject of Wednesday's hearing -- another CNN/ORC International poll out Tuesday found 56% of the public feels the federal government should also legally recognize same-sex marriages. The Justice Department will argue against the Defense of Marriage Act, a federal law, on Wednesday. Plaintiff: 'We were like most couples' This comes as President Barack Obama has changed positions on same-sex marriage over his political career. Now fully supportive, he's said would strike down California's law if he sat on the Supreme Court. Other prominent politicians have voiced timely opinions in recent weeks, indicating the matter's importance in 21st century American politics. Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and possible 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, publicly backed same-sex marriage earlier this month. The Republican party has historically backed efforts to define marriage as only between a man and a woman. But there's been notable movement of late among Republicans, including Sen. Rob Portman's recent shift to support same-sex marriage, which he made two years after his son revealed to him that he is gay. ""There is no putting this genie back in the bottle. It is undeniable. The shift is here, and we're not going back,"" Republican strategist and CNN contributor Ana Navarro said Sunday.

"(CNN)Edward W. Brooke III, the first black man popularly elected to the U.S. Senate, who died Saturday at 95, and Stuart Scott, the groundbreaking ESPN sports anchor who died Sunday at 49, transformed their country's perceptions of racial identity in distinct ways. Both challenged expectations by just being black. The reactions to their deaths signify the passage of time that separates them. When news that Scott's valiant and public eight-year battle against cancer ended Sunday morning in a Connecticut hospital, many people, especially those who had been ESPN devotees in the 20 years of Scott's tenure at the network, shared the kind of intimate bereavement associated with losing a family member or a close friend. In contrast, Brooke, who had been living in Coral Gables, Florida, when he died and was roughly 40 years removed from his Senate tenure, seemed a figure from so distant a past that people needed to be reminded of who he was and why he was important. Indeed, in what some call the ""Age of Obama,"" it's hard for many to imagine, much less recall, what a huge thing it was for Brooke to be elected a Republican U.S. senator from Massachusetts in 1966. The last two African American senators, Blanche K. Bruce and Hiram R. Revels from Mississippi, achieved their seats a century before the way other senators did, through a majority vote of their state legislature, whose rare indulgence of black plurality came about through post-Civil War Reconstruction. (Only after the 17th Amendment of the Constitution was enacted in 1912 were senators elected by a popular vote.) Nowadays, the fact that Brooke was elected as a Republican back then likely raises more eyebrows among those who can't remember that back in the early-to-middle 20th century, the GOP remained for many African Americans the ""Party of Lincoln"" and was considered more trustworthy than a Democratic Party still beholden to a Southern segregationist bloc of elected officials. Brooke's electoral triumph was part of the African American advancement in the 1960s. More than one black household in New England and elsewhere watched TV with swelling emotion the night of November 8, 1966, when Brooke accepted his victory as ""the answer the world has been waiting for,"" proving that ""the people of Massachusetts judge you on your merit and your worth alone."" It was a great moment, mitigated by changes that were, by that time, beginning to overtake the Republican Party and the civil rights movement. The GOP was gradually pulling away from its ""moderate-liberal"" wing to which Brooke had invested his political identity, asserting harder conservative values. Brooke, who placed himself in opposition to radicals on both sides of the political spectrum, seemed to more radical black politicians at best a throwback and at worst, an ""Uncle Tom"" appeasing the white political establishment. Even so, Brooke, who was briefly considered a potential running mate for the 1968 GOP nominee Richard Nixon, became one of Nixon's unwavering antagonists when the latter proposed two Supreme Court nominees whose civil rights credentials he believed to be dubious. His was also a staunch, often lonely voice among fellow Republicans, supporting abortion rights and school desegregation. He was denied a third term. In later years, he was critical of his party's rightward trend and was gratified to have lived long enough to have seen his country elect its first black president -- who was, in turn, grateful enough to Brooke's pioneer steps to give him a presidential gold medal in 2009. Stuart Scott's breakthroughs were quite different from Brooke's. There were no racial barriers to break down at ESPN when he began working there in 1993. But television anchors, whether in network or cable, news or sports, were expected in those days to maintain a smooth, stolid deportment with some elbowroom for empty ""happy talk"" between story blocks. It didn't matter if the anchors were black or white; indeed, Bryant Gumbel was for decades the model for balancing serious news with glitzy gossip. ESPN, by the early 1990s, had stretched the parameters of anchor comportment with such idiosyncratic hipsters as the bombastic Chris Berman and the droll Dan Patrick. Scott gradually made himself stand out among these strong personalities by bringing an up-to-the-minute hip-hop inspired patter as capable of sampling and mixing fragments and phrases as any rap DJ. Those phrases became riffs that recurred with every highlight tape and the riffs themselves became catch phrases that circulated through the cultural matrix. Sing along with us now: ""Cool as the other side of the pillow!"" ""And the Lawd Says You Got to Riiiiiise Up!"" ""Just Call Him Butter 'Cause He's On a Roll!"" And, of course, the ever-present ""Booyah!"" that was always looming over the next home run, slam-dunk or touchdown pass like the rim shot off a drum set. It was a style straight out of black musical-theatrical tradition that Scott brandished on the airwaves with such slick, causally adorned elegance that even viewers who were total strangers to anything with the hip-hop label got cozy with both the style and the man over two decades. Throughout, Scott made it clear to viewers that while his style was rooted in black culture, he was cosmopolitan and broad-minded in his interests. The proud North Carolinian could speak with informed passion about the life and death of Dale Earnhardt one day and come back the next breaking down the elements of a Chicago Bulls' ""triangle"" possession with the concision of a world-class linguist. While some African Americans scoffed at the way he relied on slang and pop argot for his effects, even they never questioned his authenticity, either as a professional broadcaster or as a streetwise observer. He helped bring a new archetype to intelligent black style, making doubters and haters alike re-evaluate their misgivings about turn-of-the-century ""Afro Pop"" while inspiring younger minorities to reimagine possibilities in journalism, on- and off-screen. Brooke changed the country as a black man breaking barriers. Scott changed culture as a black man being -- unapologetically -- himself. We're all better off because of them.","Edward Brooke and Stuart Scott, two important African Americans, died .

"The wife of British hostage Alan Henning pleaded Saturday with ISIS to release him, describing her husband as a ""peaceful, selfless man"" who was only in Syria to help people in need. ""I cannot see how it could assist any state's cause to allow the world to see a man like Alan dying,"" Barbara Henning said, according to a message released by the UK Foreign Office. ISIS refers to itself as ""the Islamic State."" Alan Henning, a taxi driver from near Manchester, England, was part of a team of volunteers that traveled to Syria in December to deliver food and water to people affected by the Middle Eastern country's devastating civil war. He was abducted the day after Christmas by masked gunmen, according to other people in the aid convoy. In a videotaped execution of British aid worker David Haines, made public last weekend, ISIS displayed Henning and threatened to kill him next. No response to messages . The Sunni extremist group, which controls large areas of Iraq and Syria, has already beheaded three Western captives in recent weeks -- Haines, and the American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. The videos of the executions have pointed to U.S. airstrikes against ISIS forces in Iraq as the motivation. In Haines' case, the militant group described the killing as ""a message to the allies of America."" Henning's wife said her husband, a father of two, was only trying to do good in Syria. ""Alan is a peaceful, selfless man who left his family and his job as a taxi driver in the UK to drive in a convoy all the way to Syria with his Muslim colleagues and friends to help those most in need,"" she said in the statement. She expressed concern that his captors weren't answering her calls for his release. ""I have sent some really important messages but they have not been responded to,"" she said. 'Executing this man is not the answer' ISIS has shown no regard in recent weeks for pleas from the families of its Western hostages. Days before Foley's killing was made public on August 19, his family sent the extremists a message, asking them to show mercy. But they never heard back. The week before Sotloff's execution became known, his mother released a video pleading with ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi not to kill him. And news of Haines' death came the same day that his family released a brief message to his captors through the UK Foreign Office. Henning's wife urged the militants to respond. ""I pray that the people holding Alan respond to my messages and contact me before it is too late,"" she said. ""When they hear this message, I implore the people of the Islamic State to see it in their hearts to release my husband, Alan Henning."" Leading Muslim figures in the United Kingdom have also called for Henning's release in a video posted on YouTube in which they say that killing him isn't permitted by Islamic law. ""Whatever your grievance with American or British foreign policy, executing this man is not the answer,"" said Shaykh Haitham Al Haddad, a judge on the Shariah Council in London. ""We ask you to adhere to the Shariah ruling on this matter and release him immediately and unconditionally."" The only non-Muslim . Henning was making his fourth trip to Syria with an aid convoy when he was abducted. While part of the convoy stopped at the Turkish border, Henning -- the only non-Muslim in the group -- volunteered to cross into Syria with a 10-person advance party. In video shot on that day, he explained part of his rationale for answering the call to help. ""It's all worthwhile when you see what is needed actually gets where it needs to go,"" he said, before hugging a colleague. Henning was kidnapped the next day. Dr. Shameela Islam-Zulfiqar, a volunteer doctor who stayed behind the main part of the convoy at the Turkish border, said they got a phone call saying Henning had been taken by masked gunmen. ""This was something that we thought was just a temporary measure, with him being a non-Muslim and being visibly English,"" she told CNN. The other members of the convoy thought ""that they would just question him further and then they would let him go,"" she said. But amid clashes between ISIS and rival rebel factions in the area, that didn't happen. 'He is not to blame' Now, Islam-Zulfiqar says she has a message for the people holding Henning. ""As your sister in Islam, I would implore you and beg of you: please spare the life of this innocent man,"" she said. ""He is not part of your struggle. He is not to blame for the actions of Western governments that you fight."" CAGE, a Muslim-led human rights advocacy group in London, also called for Henning's immediate release, saying he wasn't involved in any hostilities toward Muslims. But in a marked difference from other groups issuing appeals, CAGE called on the UK government to negotiate with the hostage takers. Asim Qureshi, research director of CAGE, told CNN on Sunday that the releases of Turkish and continental European hostages through negotiations ""should act as a wake-up call to the British government."" He's called 'Gadget' Islam-Zulfiqar said other members of the convoy gave Henning the affectionate nickname ""Gadget,"" for his love of all things technical. ""He really is the guy that fixes everything,"" she told CNN. In Henning's hard-scrabble hometown of Eccles in northern England, well-wishers have tied yellow ribbons to lampposts and street signs. None of his workmates at the taxi company nor any of the neighbors on his street were willing to talk to the news media. Islam-Zulfiqar says the situation is really difficult: ""We know time is running out."" Asked how people should think of Henning in his hour of need, she mentioned his smile, his concern for those around him and ""his beautiful, beautiful golden heart.""","Group calls on UK government to negotiate for Alan Henning's release .

"Having a much-loved item go missing from their baggage is something many travelers dread. So the news that dozens of baggage handlers working for the major Italian airline Alitalia have been arrested over alleged theft from passengers' luggage may confirm their worst fears. Border police made 49 arrests at Rome's Fiumicino airport, with another 37 in major Italian airports including Bari, Bologna, Milan Linate, Naples, Palermo and Verona, the Italian National Police said in a statement Friday. The 18-month-long investigation began after people reported that objects were stolen from their luggage at the airport of Lamezia Terme, police said. The alleged thefts took place on board the aircraft during the loading and unloading of baggage, police said. The investigation involved putting recording devices in the hold to identify those responsible. Alitalia security personnel also played a role in tracking down the alleged thieves, the statement said. All those arrested were Alitalia employees, whose activities were caught on camera, it said. If convicted, they could be sentenced to up to six years in prison. The accused have been charged with criminal offenses including theft, aggravated theft and damage, since the luggage that they were not able to open was sometimes damaged out of spite, police said.","Italian border police arrest 49 suspects at Rome's Fiumicino airport .

"Think your vacation cell phone bill is high? Then spare a thought for the Australian hit with more than $500,000 in charges for calls made when his device was stolen in Europe. The whopping figure came to light in a recent report by Australia's telecoms ombudsman, who received a complaint about the bill after the customer's phone provider insisted he pay it -- even though he'd reported the theft. Astonishingly, the calls -- including several to Somalia -- were made within a single 24-hour period, a fact that'll do little to reduce concerns about the high cost of roaming charges both in Australia and the rest of the world. The complaint about the bill was made by a man identified as ""David"" whose son had his phone stolen during a trip to Europe. ""He reported the theft to local police and to his provider in Australia, but because of the time difference between the continents, the provider recorded the theft as having happened a day later than it occurred,"" the ombudsman said in a report. ""Back in Australia, his son's bill came to more than AUS$570,000 ($517,000) and listed calls to Somalia."" Huge data charges . The story has a relatively happy ending: after the ombudsman stepped in, the phone provider eventually agreed to waive its demands. For many of us though, roaming costs remain a major pitfall of travel in an age when we're all carrying data-enabled device that, unless disabled, will rack up huge charges for overseas internet and email access. A 2011 report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) identified Australia as one of the most expensive countries for data roaming charges. Of the 34 nations surveyed, Australia was the seventh most costly country of origin for average roaming charges, behind Poland, Japan, Israel, Chile, Mexico, the United States and Canada. Greece and Iceland were the cheapest. Mounting anger over the high cost of phone use abroad has led to efforts to rein in phone companies. In Europe, the European Union has placed a cap on roaming charges for customers traveling within the trading bloc. The European Parliament this year voted to scrap them altogether, pending approval from individual EU governments. ETNO, the European telecoms industry body, has complained it needs roaming revenues to maintain investment in mobile networks. Either way, it's clearly a talking point -- just as long as you're not talking on a long-distance line.","Phone stolen in Europe was used to make calls to Somalia .

"Ashoka Mukpo had seen the horrible things Ebola can do. A little boy dying in a car's back seat. An old woman writhing in the street. Desperate people waiting at home for ambulances that never came. The suffering they experienced was unimaginable -- until he felt it himself. Mukpo was a day into working in Liberia as a freelance cameraman for NBC when he first fell ill from what turned out to be Ebola. He tested positive for the virus in that West African country, before being flown to Nebraska Medical Center back in the United States. He suffered, but survived. After it all, he finally fully grasped the plight of those he'd seen outside treatment centers in Liberia, too weak to move. ""They were just laying out on the ground, in the gravel, in the sun, and I used to look at them and say, 'My God, you can't sit up at least?'"" Mukpo told CNN's Don Lemon on Wednesday from his native Rhode Island. ""And then once I was sick, I completely understood. You just have absolutely no energy. To walk three feet feels like you just ran a marathon."" Like anyone else, Mukpo had been sick before. And this time around, he had body aches, chills and a fever up to 104 degrees. ""But (the symptoms) were so pronounced and so much more intense than anything that you're likely to get with the flu,"" he said. ""(Ebola) is definitely different."" Ebola survivor: Christie is 'playing politics' A Buddhist, an activist, a journalist . Thankfully, things are different now for Mukpo. On October 21, he tweeted that he'd tested negative for Ebola for three straight days. That meant he could finally leave the hospital and go home. ""The knowledge that there's no more virus in my blood is a profound relief,"" Mukpo wrote. ""I'm so lucky. Wish everyone who got sick could feel this."" For a 33-year-old, Mukpo has seen a lot. A graduate of Georgetown and the London School of Economics, he worked for years with the advocacy group, Human Rights Watch. He's a proud Buddhist who, according to a 2009 documentary, took the honorary title among Tibetan Buddhists of Tulku. ""I still think I can be of some kind of benefit to somebody,"" he said then. ""And that's, I think, what being a Buddhist is about."" Mukpo had an especially deep connection with Liberia, having worked for two years there for the nonprofit Sustainable Development Institute. So when the Ebola crisis hit there and in two neighboring West African nations, he felt compelled to act. ""He ... really made a strong connection to the Liberian people, and ... wanted to go back and see if he could make a difference,"" his father, Dr. Mitchell Levy, said earlier this month. His contributions in spreading Liberians' stories date back to July, in a piece for VICE News entitled, ""Why don't West Africans believe Ebola is real?"" More stories for that news organization and others, including Al-Jazeera, followed through September 30, when he was hired by NBC. Lauds health care workers as 'heroes' The next day, Mukpo started feeling achy and tired, after which he put himself under quarantine. Tests at a Doctors Without Borders facility the next day confirmed the worst: that he had Ebola. His parents said they believe he got the disease while cleaning out a car in Liberia where someone had gotten sick. Mukpo recalled a Doctors Without Borders doctor putting an IV in his arm in Africa, then bleeding profusely ""because Ebola thins your blood out."" ""They're so brave and such heroes,"" he said of this and other health care workers who tended for him. ""I could see that they were afraid, but they were willing to take that risk for me to ... help me survive."" More help came with his arrival, days later, in the United States. He went straight into strict isolation, unable to see his family and with all those helping him dressed head-to-toe in protective gear. Asked by CNN's Lemon about not having human contact while in treatment, Mukpo said he didn't know what that ""would have done for me at that point."" ""I needed my own strength so much that, to be touched and cared for, I'm not even sure I would have wanted that,"" he said. ""... I was so scared and sick that I think I needed to be in some kind of bubble."" Mukpo got more help from someone who'd suffered like him: Dr. Kent Brantly, an American doctor who also contracted Ebola in Liberia. A day after getting a blood transfusion from Brantly, Mukpo said he ""started to feel better"" with less of a headache and more energy. Now, Mukpo wants to return the favor to someone else with Ebola. ""I can't give blood for another two weeks, I think,"" he said, explaining that his antibody count isn't strong enough yet to be useful. ""But I want to say that Kent Brantly is a hero of mine for what he did... ""I hope that, when my number gets called, that I have that same courage.""

"It's a breathtaking scenario. Hundreds of petrol-heads roaring across some of South America's most stunning landscapes in a grueling two-week endurance race where the competitors are at the mercy of treacherous terrain. The Dakar Rally's 465 competitors speed through the daunting sand dunes of Atacama desert one day, and traverse the snow-capped Andes mountain range the next in a 9,000-kilometer coast-to-coast marathon taking in Argentina, Chile and, this year, Peru. But environmentalists are worried about the effect the event -- which attracts millions of spectators -- has on a continent that is home to a wealth of fragile ecosystems. Argentine ecological group FUNAM has accused officials of failing to conduct the necessary environmental impact assessments before ratifying the route of the race, which ends on Sunday. ""The first issue to be analyzed is regulation,"" FUNAM president Dr. Raul Montenegro told CNN. ""In Argentina, for the last rally, a lot of regulations were not accomplished by the race organizers and even local government. ""The environmental impact assessment is mandatory, and these kind of things were never presented and accomplished."" However, race director Etienne Lavigne insists the Dakar is only staged in areas where it has permission to go. ""Where we are going to go with the Dakar, we are authorized to go,"" Lavigne told CNN. ""That means we work all the year with all the administration in each country to get permission to go where it's possible to go. ""The Dakar is like a cocktail. Which means you need to put in a lot of ingredients. Every year we chose the best places for the best sport in the event. ""This year, with three countries, we have a fantastic route with a lot of different landscapes, very different every day. A level of difficulty is very important every day. With the three countries, we are really in the best position to have the best route for the 2012 edition."" But Montenegro counters that this desire to find the most dramatic and challenging landscapes is taking the rally into terrains which are not ready for the barrage of vehicles -- which come in four categories: cars, motorbikes, quadbikes and trucks.. ""Most of the adventure of the Dakar is to use natural landscapes and scenery,"" Montenegro said. ""Our region, Argentina, Chile and now Peru, are really not prepared for this kind of event, especially environments which have very fragile ecosystems."" The Dakar, first staged in 1979, is named after the Senegalese capital which once served as its finishing point. Competitors would set off from the French capital of Paris, in the shadow of the iconic Eiffel Tower, and make tracks through north Africa to Senegal and, for the victorious few, racing immortality. A test of courage, stamina, strength and skill, the Dakar relocated to South America in 2009 after the murder of a French family in Mauritania, combined with terrorist threats made against the race, forced the cancellation of the previous year's event. The continental switch has forced competitors to adapt to new sets of laws and regulations in South America, a transition that has thrown up several problems, according to Montenegro. He and his team took many photos during last year's installment that claim to show drivers breaking traffic laws on local roads when traveling between stages of the race. ""During the 2011 rally, it was clear the people taking part in the competition in Argentina violated (traffic laws). Not during the competition itself, but during connections between stages,"" he said. ""We took more than 180 pictures showing these infractions. They put families in danger because at the time it was the holiday season in Cordoba."" Lavigne insists the Dakar is committed to doing all it can to ensure race entrants obey local laws during the rally. ""We work with all the authorities, the police,"" he said. ""They need to respect the law. We are increasing the level of control with the full support of all the police authorities in the three countries."" Organizers have sent the images captured by Montenegro and his colleagues to the 2012 entrants as examples of how not to drive on local roads. Despite the controversy surrounding the Dakar, it would seem the rally is a hit with local fans. The event's official website claimed that last year five million spectators across two countries turned out -- 3.5 million in Argentina and 1.5 million in Chile. And Lavigne revealed that three more nations want to follow Peru and join the race. ""We can imagine including a new country in the next route in 2013. At the moment it's a bit early to speak about it, but we are working on some projects including a new country,"" he said. ""We have good potential there (in South America) with a lot of propositions from other countries like Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia."" The race's official website claims that ""entering the Dakar is, in a certain way, like climbing Everest, sailing round the globe or rowing round the world."" Regardless of the political and environmental issues surrounding the rally, the racers who are crowned winners in Buenos Aires on Sunday will have achieved an unforgettable feat.","The 33rd edition of the Dakar Rally will come to a conclusion on Sunday .

"(CNN)Game changer. A much-used -- and thus often misused -- moniker that anoints the something or someone that greets the status quo with a seismic blow so great that the game is placed on a new, irreversible trajectory. The internal combustion engine, for example, was a game changer. Electricity, Eleanor Roosevelt and Nike were game changers. And longtime ESPN anchor Stuart Scott was also a game changer. If you find that proclamation a bit hyperbolic, it's only because you either didn't know or have forgotten how sports anchoring sounded before Scott's arrival at ESPN in 1993. Howard Cosell brought personality to the field. Lesley Visser, Bryant Gumbel and others smashed glass ceilings. Keith Olbermann and Dan Patrick brought jovial irreverence. But it was Scott who looked at the profession and doused it with hot sauce. As hip-hop was shoehorning its way into mainstream, Scott -- with his ""Fresh Prince of Bel Air"" fade and urban vernacular -- was one of its leading ambassadors. Though he was so much more than a young black sports anchor at the right time at the right place. He was a workhorse, a personable interviewer and a nimble reporter. The creative insight wrapped around one of his popular catchphrases, ""as cool as the other side of the pillow,"" showed he was a talent who didn't sacrifice journalistic integrity just to bring barbershop talk to television. His humorous flashes of black Americana didn't appeal to everyone and his critics were not shy about sending him letters to let him know. But for those of us who longed for a soundtrack to accompany the soul of the new generation of black athletes who were redefining how big-time sports were played, Scott was a welcomed and masterful composer. And the music he made was a sound that today is repeatedly mimicked. Sometimes by earnest youngsters who have no idea who dared to change the game, like someone's classic hip-hop playlist without the Sugarhill Gang. My friends and I watched Scott in college at night and would use his catchphrases -- such as ""booyah"" -- to trash-talk each other on the court the next day. When I was offered a job at ESPN 10 years ago, meeting Scott was one of my top priorities on my list. And when I finally did get to introduce myself, I was so nervous, I tripped over my own name. This was before his first cancer diagnosis in 2007. Our first meeting was brief but his advice was long lasting: Do your homework and be yourself. Each time I saw Scott after that, he didn't just greet me with a smile, he met me with infectious joy. This, even after the cancer had returned. ""When you die, it does not mean that you lose to cancer,"" he said at the ESPY's last July. ""You beat cancer by how you live, why you live, and in the manner in which you live."" There are not many of us who have not been intimately touched by this terrible disease. Some have lost mothers, sisters, daughters. Others forced to say goodbye to fathers, brothers and sons. We fundraise through local 5Ks, wear yellow, LiveStrong wristbands or find something pink to wear in October, all to let cancer know it will not win. I was not a close friend of Scott's, but I can tell you whenever I spoke with him, he was the embodiment of this spirit. Never pity, always fighting. Perhaps spending 20 years at ESPN encountering some of the greatest champions in the history of sports influenced his approach to his own battle. Maybe his demeanor was just a natural reflection of who he was, considering he played club football at the University of North Carolina and ""game recognizes game"" was one of his on-air sayings. Or maybe he knew we were all watching and he never wanted to let us down. The way he knew being one of but a handful of black men on primetime television in the early 1990s, we were all watching. The way he knew young journalists roaming the halls at a National Association of Black Journalists conference were watching. The way he knew aspiring journalists and sports fans everywhere were watching. And listening -- to the songs only he could write. To the music only he dared to play. Like many of my ESPN colleagues, I am deeply saddened by his passing. But there is comfort in knowing each time a sports anchor tries to add a little somethin'-somethin' to their report, we can still hear his voice.","LZ Granderson: Stuart Scott brought the sound of hip-hop to the sports anchoring world .

"(CNN)Phylicia Rashad says she was misquoted. She says she wasn't being dismissive of the women who've accused Bill Cosby of sexual assault when she came to the comedian's defense in an online interview. ""I am a woman. I would never do that,"" she said on ABC's ""World News Tonight With David Muir"" on Wednesday. 'Forget these women' Rashad played Clair Huxtable, Bill Cosby's TV wife, on the groundbreaking NBC sitcom ""The Cosby Show."" Cosby's now been accused of harassing, drugging and sexually assaulting multiple women. And in an interview with Showbiz 411, Rashad said she never saw any indication of the behavior that the women have attributed to Cosby. ""Forget these women,"" Rashad is quoted as telling the outlet. ""What you're seeing is the destruction of a legacy. And I think it's orchestrated. I don't know why or who's doing it, but it's the legacy. And it's a legacy that is so important to the culture."" Fast forward to Wednesday night. Rashad says the Showbiz 411 piece didn't accurately reflect what she said -- especially the ""forget these women"" part. ""That was a misquote. That is not what I said,"" Rashad said. ""What I said is, 'this is not about the women. This is about something else. This is about the obliteration of legacy.' "" In a Wednesday post, Roger Friedman, the columnist who wrote the Showbiz 411 article, denied that he misquoted Rashad, but wrote that he understands how her words were taken out of context. ""She didn't mean for it to be taken the way it was, and I should have punctuated. There was NEVER the meaning in 'Forget those women' that she was saying to actually forget or dismiss then."" He continued, ""She meant, 'those women aside' -- as in, she's not talking about that, she's talking about Cosby's legacy being destroyed. It was conversational. Somehow this got twisted. I am really sorry if the way I presented it made it seem like either one of us was forgetting anyone."" Allred calls Rashad out . In coming to the defense of her TV husband, Rashad has now waded into a controversy that continues to dog Cosby. More than 20 women have come forward with claims, and a defamation lawsuit has been filed against Cosby. On Wednesday, attorney Gloria Allred brought out three more women -- Linda Kirkpatrick, Lynn Neal and a woman who chose to be identified only as Kacey -- who say they were sexually assaulted by the comedian after being drugged by him. While introducing the women, Allred addressed Rashad's statements to Showbiz 411. ""Phylicia, you should be supporting these women rather than joining Cosby's paid 'attack dogs' who are trying to undermine them in any way that they can,"" Allred said. Cosby stays mum . And Cosby? He's maintaining his silence -- as he's done while his reputation suffers. He was in Kitchener, Ontario, on Wednesday night for a standup appearance. A few dozen protestors rallied outside, but the show went on without a hitch. Larger protests are planned for Thursday night's shows. After his set, Cosby released a statement thanking attendees. ""I would like to personally thank you for giving me the opportunity to bring laughter back into your lives tonight,"" he said.  Also, I would like to applaud all of you and give you a standing ovation for respecting yourselves, the theatre (Centre In The Square) and the event organizers that produced a spectacular show for the Kitchener Community.""

McLaughlin, Lisa Respers France and Todd Leopold contributed to this report from Atlanta, and Paula Newton from Ontario.","Writer says he did not misquote Phylicia Rashad but that her comment is misunderstood .

"(CNN)You won't see any pouty lips or peace signs in these selfies. The criticized and laughable trend has spread to the devices used to capture them. Prepping for their ultimate self-portrait, vintage cameras docked on old tripods pucker up for their own selfie against backdrops that bring out their best qualities. No filters necessary. These unusual photos offer a view of the oft forgotten film cameras that brought us to the digital age and ushered in the selfie. Wanting to capture the rich history of analog in a modern, striking fashion, photographer and engineer Jürgen Novotny developed CameraSelfies, a continuing project featuring cameras from the 1920s onward. Novotny has a personal tie to some of these antique cameras: The Agfa Silette was a gift from his father when he turned 6. It gave him the outlet to deal with his ""creative boosts,"" he said, the freedom to isolate moods and generate ""special, subjective views on a situation."" This passion turned into a portfolio with styles ranging from still life to surreal landscapes. Novotny could think of no better way to pay homage to the medium of his work than by having the cameras themselves display their true colors. He began to collect historic cameras from friends or on auction sites like eBay for little to nothing.

"(CNN)An English soccer club has abandoned an attempt to sign a convicted rapist after death threats were made to its staff amid an atmosphere of ""unbearable pressure."" After days of speculation, Oldham Athletic confirmed Thursday it wouldn't be handing a deal to Ched Evans, who was released from prison in October after serving half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old girl. The third-tier outfit said ""vile and abusive threats"" as well as ""significant financial pressure"" placed on the club from sponsors had prompted it to backtrack on the deal. Oldham's owner, Simon Corney, had previously said there was 80% chance it would hire Evans as it appeared undeterred by condemnation from fans, politicians and the police. Evans -- who insists he is innocent and is appealing against his conviction -- released his own statement Thursday, apologizing ""for the effects that night in Rhyl has had on many people, not least the woman concerned."" And after Oldham's snub there are serious question marks as to whether any club will offer him a route back into the game. ""The whole issue has divided opinion and the club has been put under unbearable pressure as a result,"" read a statement on Oldham's official website. ""Proceeding could have placed significant financial pressure on the club and continued to be a divisive influence. As a consequence the deal could not go ahead. ""As a club we condemn all crime including rape and irrespective of any appeal procedure it was always the case that we were prepared to withstand the barrage of abuse that is evident within the country and on social media. ""We deplore and condemn the vile and abusive threats, some including death threats, which have been made to our fans, sponsors and staff whilst this process has been in the public domain."" Despite Oldham's claims, Greater Manchester Police said nothing more than ""low level abuse"" had been reported to them when contacted by CNN. Oldham's climbdown represents the latest setback for Evans, who has been trying to resurrect his career since leaving jail in October. Evans started out at current English Premier League champion Manchester City, before joining Sheffield United in 2009. Upon his release from prison, the club's plan to allow Evans to train with them provoked a public backlash, with 160,000 people signing a petition against the move. A proposed deal with Hartlepool was also dropped following a similar outcry, the town's Labour MP calling Evans a ""pariah."" And when a potential move to Maltese club Hibernians was mooted, the UK government's Ministry of Justice said its conditions for monitoring sex offenders effectively ruled out working abroad. Prior to confirmation the deal was off Evans released his own statement through the Professional Footballers Association, in which he apologized for the effect the case has had on his victim's life. ""Upon legal advice I was told not to discuss the events in question,"" he said. ""This silence has been misinterpreted as arrogance and I would like to state that this could not be further from the truth. ""I do remain limited at present by what I can say due to the ongoing referral to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, and whilst I continue to maintain my innocence I wish to make it clear that I wholeheartedly apologize for the effects that night in Rhyl has had on many people, not least the woman concerned. ""Finally it has been claimed that those using social media in an abusive and vindictive way towards this woman are supporters of mine. I wish to make it clear that these people are not my supporters and I condemn their actions entirely and will continue to do so."" As an online petition protesting against Oldham acquiring Evans' signature joining nudged past 70,000 signatures, the town's council leader said the saga had created a culture of ""intimidation, abuse and harassment."" ""The whole episode has divided the town and public opinion and there are no winners in all this -- not least of all the reputation of our club and town,"" Jim McMahon said. ""In recent days we've seen an horrendous 'trial by social media' with intimidation, abuse and harassment on a scale that has cast a terrible shadow. ""I am urging people on all sides of this debate to please now take stock, show some restraint and calm."" ""I've always believed in rehabilitation but felt that both club and player should have allowed Mr Evans' appeal to run its course before agreeing a contract,"" McMahon added. ""As it stands Mr Evans has been found guilty in a court of law and has not yet completed his sentence. However, I take no pleasure in this outcome."" The case has reached the highest level of British politics, with Prime Minister David Cameron repeatedly asked to comment on Evans' potential return to football. He said he ""understood"" the view of Olympic heptathlon champion Jessica Ennis-Hill after she told Sheffield United she wanted her name removed from one of the stands at its stadium should Evans play for it again. And Cameron waded into the controversy again on Thursday when he told LBC: ""My view is it is not for politicians to pick football teams, it should be for football clubs to pick their teams. ""But as they do that, they have to recognize that football players are role models for young people and they have to think about what will the impact be on the club, what will the impact be on young people. ""As for people who are in this position, surely the position is to recognize when you have done something wrong and you have been punished, rightly punished, you've got to work your way back. ""That might mean doing more voluntary work, putting more back in, in order to demonstrate to the public, the football-loving country we are, that you are really sorry about what happened and you want to atone for what you have done.""","Oldham Athletic confirms deal to sign Ched Evans is off .

"(CNN)Chelsea relinquished sole leadership of the English Premier League after suffering a surprise 5-3 defeat at the hands of a Harry Kane inspired Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane Thursday. It was a result few had foreseen, particularly when Diego Costa put Jose Mourinho's men ahead midway through the first half. But Kane, pushing for an England call up, leveled with an exquisite individual goal and Danny Rose put Spurs 2-1 ahead after he reacted quickly when Nacer Chadli's shot hit the post and rebounded back into play. Kane was then fouled by Gary Cahill with Andros Townsend scoring from the penalty spot to give the home side a 3-1 lead at the break. It was 4-1 shortly into the second half when Kane's neat footwork set him up for a fourth, but still the points were not sealed. A mistake by Federico Fazio allowed Eden Hazard to play a one-two with Cesc Fabregas to reduce the deficit to two goals. Tottenham nerves were finally eased when Kane played a neat pass to Chadli for the Belgian international to score the fifth only for John Terry to grab his third in four games for Chelsea to complete an eight-goal thriller. Earlier, Manchester City joined Chelsea on 46 points with the same goal difference after a headed goal from former Chelsea star Frank Lampard gave the reigning title holder a 3-2 win over Sunderland. Lampard, whose extended loan to City from New York City was confirmed on the eve of the match, grabbed a late winner after City had thrown away a two-goal lead at the Etihad. The 36-year-old former England midfielder connected with Gael Clichy's cross to secure a vital three points with a seventh home league win of the season. City looked to be cruising to victory after a superb strike from Yaya Toure and a second from Stevan Jovetic. But Sunderland hit back with goals from former City players Jack Rodwell and Adam Johnson, who scored from the spot. In the early kickoff on New Year's Day, Manchester United was held to its second straight draw of the festive period in a 1-1 draw at Stoke. The home side went ahead after just two minutes through defender Ryan Shawcross but Radamel Falcao leveled for United in the 26th. United, held goalless at Tottenham last weekend, remain third in the standings and are unbeaten in 10 games, but manager Louis Van Gaal  was unhappy with the display. ""We didn't deserve any more than a draw,"" he moaned. ""They were closer to a winning goal than us. We should have played better today."" Struggling West Bromwich Albion has also confirmed the appointment of former Stoke and Crystal Palace boss Tony Pulis as its head coach. Pulis, widely praised for lifting Palace into mid-table last season before leaving before the start of this campaign, watched from the stand as his new team secured a fighting 1-1 draw at West Ham. Southampton kept up its challenge for a Champions League spot by inflicting a damaging 2-0 defeat on Arsenal to stay fourth. Two goalkeeping errors from Wojciech Szczesny allowed Sadio Mane and Dusan Tadic to score in either half for the Saints, who withstood late pressure from Arsenal to secure a vital three points. In the relegation battle, bottom side Leicester secured an unlikely point after hitting back from two down at Liverpool to grab a 2-2 draw, while Burnley hit back three times to level 3-3 at Newcastle. It denied Newcastle caretaker boss John Carver three points after taking over from Alan Pardew, who is set to link up with Crystal Palace and was at Villa Park to watch them battle to a goalless draw.","Tottenham beats Chelsea 5-3 at White Hart Lane .

"(CNN)The dawning of the New Year is often seen as a time for new beginnings. But the first fixture of 2015 marked the end of a 22-game winning streak for Real Madrid which went down 2-1 to an all-action Valencia side Sunday. Cristiano Ronaldo opened the scoring from the penalty spot after 12 minutes but Los Blancos were pegged back at the beginning of the second half when Antonio Barragan's strike deflected off Pepe and beyond Iker Casillas. Nicolas Otamendi then rose highest in the Madrid box to power a header beyond Casillas a little over 10 minutes later to give Valencia a lead they would refuse to relinquish. Madrid did create numerous chances for the equalizer but were foiled by a mixture of poor finishing, heroic defending and some spectacular goalkeeping from Valencia's Diego Alves Carreira. Valencia also had chances of its own as Madrid piled forward in the latter stages. Barragan in particular was guilty of being wasteful as he fired wide when through on Casillas. After the match, Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti lamented his side's inability to kill the game off when they were ahead. ""There were key moments in which we could make the second goal,"" Ancelotti told the Real Madrid website. ""But it didn't materialize. You can not always be effective."" ""We worked well and we had chances to score (and) we deserved at least a draw."" Valencia boss, Nuno Espirito Santo, was in more ebullient mood when speaking to reporters. ""This victory deserves a lot of credit, as does the fact that we came back from behind,"" he said in comments carried by the Valencia website. He continued, ""I still believe that our biggest success is yet to come. It was a great win, but we still only have 34 points. It is not the time to celebrate anything, although of course the fans have to enjoy the victory."" The result meant Madrid's great rivals Barcelona could have returned to the summit of La Liga if it defeated David Moyes' Real Sociedad later on Sunday. But an own goal from defender Jordi Alba saw the Catalans lose 1-0 despite a frantic second period in which they dominated. Barca remain a point behind Real in second position and are ahead of third placed Atletico Madrid, which won comfortably against Levante on Saturday, only on goal difference. Valencia, meanwhile, move up to fourth and into the final Champions League spot. English FA Cup . After a hectic period of fixtures over the festive period, England's leading clubs returned to action in the FA Cup Sunday. Manchester United, Chelsea and Manchester City all overcame lower-league opposition with varying degrees of comfort. United had to wait until the second half before goals from Ander Herrera and Angel Di Maria secured a 2-0 victory over Yeovil Town. Chelsea overcame Watford in far more comfortable fashion at Stamford Bridge. The Blues won 3-0 thanks to strikes from Willian, Loic Remy and Kurt Zouma. Manchester City meanwhile had to come from behind to win 2-1 at home Sheffield Wednesday. James Milner struck twice in the second half to spare City's blushes. Although the competition is notorious for feats of giant killing over the years there were few shock results Sunday. The most surprising was perhaps Premier League QPR being downed 3-0 at home by third-tier side Sheffield United. Elsewhere, Aston Villa defeated Blackpool thanks to a solitary goal from Belgian striker Christian Benteke while Southampton was held at home to Ipswich Town of the Championship. In the day's late game, Arsenal comfortably eased aside Hull City 2-0 in a repeat of last year's final. Per Mertersacker opened the scoring for the Gunners in the first half while a late second from Alexis Sanchez rounded off a routine victory. French Cup . As in England, there were few surprises in France's premier cup competition. Monaco defeated Nimes 2-0 with strikes from Bernardo Silva and Valere Germain while goals from Thomas Toure and Abdou Traore ensured Bordeaux overcame Toulouse 2-1. In perhaps the tie of the round, Lyon were made to sweat for their 3-2 victory against Ligue 1 rivals Lens. After taking a three-goal lead in the first half through Nabil Fekir, Alexandre Lacazette Lacazette and Mouhamadou Dabo goals, Lyon conceded two in the second period but held on to claim victory.","Valencia defeat Real Madrid 2-1 at Mestalla Stadium .

"(CNN)If you're an American kid thinking of fame and fortune you have a new path to help you achieve your dreams. U.S. national team coach Jurgen Klinsmann is insistent the sport of soccer can match the superstar-making ability of traditional American powerhouses like the NFL and the NBA. ""Soccer is a real alternative now to other sports to make it all the way to the top,"" the German, who led the USMNT to the second round of the 2014 World Cup, told CNN. Soccer enjoyed an upsurge in popularity in the U.S. off the back of the team's showing in Brazil, which saw Klinsmann's team finish second in its group and suffer an agonizing extra-time defeat to Belgium in the round of 16. The performances of players like goalkeeper Tim Howard and team captain Clint Dempsey during the tournament made them household names in their homeland and Klinsmann hopes more players can achieve such recognition. Thousands of U.S. soccer fans also travelled to Brazil to support their team. ""The United States is a very fast-growing soccer market,"" insisted the 50-year-old, who has coached the team since 2011 and recently signed a contract extension until 2018. ""There is a young professional league coming up ... the youth system is getting better and better, there is a lot of education that will be done over the next years. ""Just to be in the middle of all that with this international team is fascinating. It's something you can have a handle on and that is what I really enjoy."" Earlier this week U.S. Soccer president Sunil Gulati outlined a number of changes to the federation's youth set up as it seeks to align its ""technical practices with the best in the world."" Notably U.S. Soccer is to introduce three extra age groups for its teams. ""Beginning in the Fall of 2016, U.S. Soccer will add an Under-12 age group to the Development Academy program,"" said U.S. Soccer statement. ""Also on the Academy side, the Federation will increase funding for the Academy Scholarship Program. Among other initiatives, U.S. Soccer will be augmenting Youth National Team programming by adding U-16 and U-19 National Teams."" Prior to signing a contract with U.S. soccer, Klinsmann coached his native Germany -- guiding the country during its hosting of the 2006 World Cup -- before enduring a testing period in charge of his former club Bayern Munich. But he has long held affinity for the U.S., dating back to playing for Germany during the USA '94 World Cup and vacations he took prior to his appointment as the country's football coach. Klinsmann's wife, former model Debbie Chin, is American and the couple live in California with their two children. ""I appreciated the culture, the laid back people, the mentality that they let you live your life the way you want to live it,"" he explained. ""They respect you no matter what you are trying to do. ""I ended up in Europe meeting an American girl and getting married to a wonderful American wife, and then we had to settle the family in either Europe or the U.S. ""So step-by-step I've been through that process and ended up in the coaching world."" However Klinsmann's tenure has not been without controversy . The 50-year-old riled Major League Soccer (MLS) commissioner Don Garber earlier this year by suggesting Dempsey and fellow midfielder Michael Bradley had potentially damaged their careers by deciding to leave European clubs and move to MLS. Garber slammed Klinsmann's comments as damaging to the league -- which recently concluded its 19th season with Los Angeles Galaxy beating New England Revolution in the championship game. But despite the continued growth of MLS -- Garber hopes it will expand from the current 19 teams to 24 by 2020 -- Klinsmann is eager to continue America's soccer ""education."" ""I think a lot of people in the United States haven't connected the dots yet,"" he said. ""There is a lot of knowledge out there but knowledge is spread all over the place. ""Our job will be in the next couple of years to educate parents, educate players, educate a lot of coaches out there, in order to catch up with the best in the world. ""Going forward we want to raise the bar and we want to go further in a World Cup. But it is only possible if the foundation of it -- meaning the grassroots level, the youth level, and the after the youth system going into the pro-level -- is functioning better.""","Jurgen Klinsmann insists soccer offers U.S. kids a route ""all the way to the top""

"An attack on apartments that neighbors say were used as a brothel in Baghdad has killed at least 28 women and six men, security officials told CNN. Unidentified militants wearing military uniforms and street clothes stormed apartments Saturday in the Zayona residential complexes in eastern Baghdad, officials said. They fired their weapons in the streets before breaking down doors to enter the buildings, security officials and residents told CNN. Once inside, they killed the men and women, officials said. Attackers left a message on a door: ""This is the fate of any prostitution,"" an Agence France-Presse correspondent on the scene reported. Residents told CNN the Shiite Asa'b Ahl al-Haq organization carried out the attack. But the organization told CNN it does not have forces inside the city. There was no letup in violence Monday, with two car bombs in Baghdad and a roadside bomb in Iraqi's semiautonomous Kurdish region. There were also ongoing clashes in Salaheddin province, 70 kilometers (about 44 miles) north of the capital. Two people were killed and 14 others wounded in the separate car bombings in the al-Bayaa and al-Alawi areas of Baghdad, police officials said. Meanwhile, a roadside bomb targeted a Kurdish police convoy patrolling a road between Sulaimaniya and Diyala provinces, killing one police officer, Kurdish Peshmerga officials told CNN. The area is controlled by the Peshmerga Kurdish fighters. In Salaheddin province, fighting between militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, and Iraqi forces backed by Sunni al-Jubouri tribesmen broke out late Saturday in Dhuluiya, police officials and a tribal representative told CNN. ISIS controls 50% of the town, including the mayor's office, municipal council and the police building, they said. Six security force members and tribal fighters have been killed in the fighting. ISIS, an al Qaeda splinter group, has led Sunni insurgents who have taken over large areas of northern and western Iraq in an offensive that began last month. The terrorist group has also made major gains in Syria in its quest to establish an Islamic state spanning both countries. ""ISIS terrorist groups started shelling the town with mortars from the northern side of the town,"" the al-Jubouri spokesman said, before pickup trucks loaded with armed militants moved in to occupy government buildings. A YouTube video purportedly from ISIS shows militants raising a flag over the buildings. ""We are steadfast and will cleanse the town from them in 48 hours,"" the al-Jubouri spokesman said. Inside Baghdad hospital, harrowing tales from the front line . U.S. report on Iraqi readiness . The initial U.S. military assessment of Iraqi security forces ordered by U.S. President Barack Obama was given Monday to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a Pentagon spokesman said. Pentagon officials will review the report -- which assesses the capabilities, training, morale, leadership, and command and control of Iraq's forces -- before giving the President recommendations for the next steps in supporting Iraq's forces. Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said the United States has ""not moved to an advisory capacity at this point."" Two U.S. officials tell CNN a major concern that has been raised is the overwhelming sectarianism in Iraqi forces. In particular, U.S. commanders are concerned if they move into a direct advisory role of Iraqi government forces, it will be perceived as taking sides with the Iranian-backed Shiite elements inside Iraqi units. U.S. military personnel are also looking at why so many Iraqi units collapsed in the face of the initial ISIS advances and whether it is possible to even reconstitute those units to the point that U.S. advisers would be useful. The officials also said that if Baghdad was attacked, Iraqi forces would need help from Iranian-backed militia. Another concern is infiltration of Iraqi units by militants and potential green-on-blue attacks -- that is, attacks on U.S. personnel by members of the Iraqi forces. Kirby would not say what was in the report but noted, ""This is a lesson that certainly we learned in recent years from Afghanistan. We always keep in mind and have to keep in mind the insider threat, and we have to factor that in when we are doing work in a partnership capacity n a situation such as this, where it's as dangerous as it is."" President Obama has authorized 300 military advisers in Iraq, 210 of which are there now. ISIS success in Syria . ISIS also has been making gains in Syria. In the eastern Syria city of Deir Ezzor, militants took control of areas that had been held by other rebel groups, such has al-Nusra Front and the Free Syrian Army, the UK-based opposition group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The other rebels either left the city or pledged allegiance to ISIS, the observatory said. That means the city is controlled partly by the government and partly by ISIS. Deir Ezzor is 100 kilometers (62 miles) east of the Iraqi border. ISIS now controls about 95% of greater Deir Ezzor province, which borders Iraq, the observatory said. In other violence over the weekend in Iraq, militants believed to be with ISIS attacked the city of Haditha from four directions, said Hameed Ahmed al-Hashim, a member of the Anbar provisional council, and two security officials in Haditha. A large military force backed by tribesmen defended the city, they said. Iraqi jet fighters bombed a bridge controlled by militants east of Falluja, causing structural damage, al-Hashim said. Three police officers were wounded when a roadside bomb exploded near their convoy in Kirkuk, a security official told CNN on Saturday.","U.S. worried about sectarianism in Iraqi forces, sources tell CNN .

"To mark the end of Islam's holiest month, Iftikhar Ali will head not to a mosque but to a convention center guarded by law enforcement officers. That's because this month, during Ramadan, the mosque in Joplin, Missouri, burned to the ground. Its rubble smoldered for two days as a shocked Muslim community came to terms with what had happened. ""I think there are a few people who don't like anybody,"" Ali said. ""They don't like a different color than their color or different religions."" Ali, who is the president of the Joplin mosque, said the congregation rented a convention center so people would have a place to pray and celebrate Eid al-Fitr, the feast that marks the end of fasting for Ramadan. My Take: How evangelicals could grow to love Muslims . Authorities are still investigating the mosque burning but suspect the fire was intentional. In July, a surveillance camera caught a man throwing an incendiary device onto the building that damaged part of the roof. Ahead of Eid, Ali said he contacted the police and sheriff's department. They are sending extra officers Sunday. It's that way across America, after a spate of violence at Islamic centers in recent weeks that included a homemade bomb and pigs parts. At least seven mosques and one cemetery were attacked in America during Ramadan, according to groups that track such incidents. ""This is unprecedented in its scale and scope,"" said Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the civil rights and advocacy group, Council on American-Islamic Relations. He said Muslims have not been under attack like this since the backlash after the September 11 attacks and the immediate aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing when it was assumed the work of Islamic extremists. Just Thursday, Ahmed Rehab, the head of the council in Chicago, received a call from a young man visiting his father's grave at Evergreen Cemetery. Someone had desecrated several Muslim graves. The Prophet Mohammed's name was taken in vain and, a black marker scrawling on a tombstone screamed: ""raghead,"" a derogatory term for Muslims that stems from head coverings like turbans and kaffiyas. A few days earlier, police arrested 51-year-old David Conrad and accused him of firing a pellet gun at a mosque filled with 500 people in Morton Grove, southern Chicago suburb. No one was injured but worshipers said one of the bullets flew only inches above a security guard's head, according to CNN affiliate station WGN. Conrad is a neighbor and had previously spoken out against the expansion of the mosque. He was charged with four felonies. In a third Chicago-area incident, worshipers at an Islamic school in Lombard heard a loud noise outside of the building during night prayers. They then found a 2-liter soda bottle filled with acid. Police identified it as a homemade bomb. No was injured in that incident, either, but on the heels of the carnage at the Sikh temple in suburban Milwaukee, and the burning of the Joplin mosque, Muslims in the United States were fearful. The temple shooter died and his motives may never be known. But he was linked to white supremacist groups and Hooper said many people felt the Sikhs were mistaken for Muslims because of their turbans and beards. In Murfreesboro, Tennessee, a new mosque opened this month after more than two years of community protests, legal hurdles and vandalism. The board of directors planned for extra security. Tennessee mosque opens after 2 years of controversy . When worshipers bow their heads in prayer Sunday, someone else will be scanning the room. ""Yes, we are very concerned because we have been the subject of vandalism, arson, bomb threats, intimidation, bullying,"" said Saleh Sbenaty, a board member of the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro. ""You call it,"" he said. ""Every single act of intimidation, you know, was actually inflicted upon us."" Hooper, the spokesman for the Islamic Council, said Muslims in the United States have been asked to exercise caution. The council released a tip sheet on security: know your emergency responders, post observers, report threats, install surveillance cameras. Hooper said anti-Muslim rhetoric has been building for years, especially from groups formed specifically to fight against Islam in the United States. ""Anti-Muslim hate groups are a relatively new phenomenon in the United States, most of them appearing in the aftermath of the World Trade Center terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001,"" according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks such groups. ""Earlier anti-Muslim groups tended to be religious in orientation and disputed Islam's status as a respectable religion,"" the center said. Hooper, for one, believes there's an ""Islamophobia machine working out there."" ""Eventually and inevetiably, it's going to have an impact on the tiny minority of people willing to carry out acts of violence,"" he said. Rehab of CAIR's Chicago office also blamed the spike in incidents on government officials who he said were involved in fear-mongering. He cited statements made by Republican congressman Joe Walsh of Illinois who warned Americans that ""there is a radical strain of Islam in this country""and that radicals are ""trying to kill Americans every week."" Justin Roth, Walsh's chief of staff, said the lawmaker's comments were taken out of context and that Walsh is troubled by attacks on any people based on their religion. Nevertheless, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee blamed Walsh for the homemade bomb incident. ""It is not a coincidence that after the remarks by Rep. Walsh were made that there was a homemade bomb directed at an Islamic school ..."" the committee said. ""The facts are clear -- By proclaiming to the public that 'Muslims are trying to kill Americans every week,' Walsh raised suspicion of the American Muslim community and incited fear."" There were other troubling incidents this month: . -- In Hayward, California, police arrested two teens and charged them with committing a hate crime after worshipers said the boys threw lemons at worshipers during prayer. -- In Ontario, California, pig legs were left on the property of an Islamic Center. Police still do not have information on who was responsible for the act, which was particularly offensive during Ramadan to practicing Muslims who consider pigs as unclean. -- In North Smithfield, Rhode Island, a surveillance camera outside the Masjid Al-Islam mosque showed a suspect breaking the building's sign and two vehicles later fleeing the property. -- In Oklahoma City, vandals defaced the Grand Mosque with paintball guns. Those inside the mosque feared the shots came from a real gun. In Joplin, the torched mosque's 90 congregants invited 300 other people to join them Sunday for Eid. ""I still feel secure,"" said Ali, the mosque president, though he knows a pall has been cast by all the attacks. He said the attacks on his community are instigated by a few ignorant people. He came to these shores from Pakistan 23 years ago and still believes in the principles of this nation. ""This is un-American,"" he said of the mosque fire. ""I'm not afraid of any neighbors. I feel more secure here in America than anywhere else in the world."" He said all Muslims have a right to practice their faith without fear.

And when Alzheimer's disease began to steal her memory, Fraley said, it was amazing to watch the effect of music on her, almost like a drug that relieved her tension and made her feel good, even as the disease changed her into someone new each week, like a child growing up in reverse. In the video, as Fraley starts to play, a smile spreads across his mother's face and she starts to bounce. She's singing along, beaming at him. He pauses. ""What do you think, Mom?"" ""I think you're wonderful."" That was two months ago. She hasn't recognized him for a couple of weeks. Last week, Fraley showed up at the Glen Park assisted living community for dementia and Alzheimer's patients, in Monrovia, California, and began to play. She walked out of the room. As a release for his sadness, Fraley went on the social-sharing site Reddit on Friday and posted the 2-month-old video along with this message: . ""I recently stopped bringing my guitar to my Mom's home because she no longer recognizes me and doesn't respond to it anymore. I wish I would have a played a lot more to her when she did."" The video has been watched by more than 1.2 million people. ""I have never seen anything on the Internet as profoundly moving as this,"" one commenter wrote on Reddit. ""I know it's just a short window into your life, but I feel as if your kind soul can be seen clearly. How much love your mama has for you, and how you comfort her is so beautiful."" Fraley works as a technology coordinator for a Catholic high school in Montibello, California. He was a little embarrassed to share something so personal with the whole world -- he feared perhaps he was exploiting his mother and letting strangers see her at her worst -- but having seen the response, he's glad he posted it. He knew he had captured a special moment that encompassed the essence of who she was, what she was going through and what he was going through all at once. ""To see your mom scared is the worst thing imaginable, and to see her falling away from you slowly, it's unreal,"" he said. ""You just have to be calm and smile and basically just comfort them as they go down, because you have no control over what's happening."" Judy Fraley was a therapist and healer who taught for over 30 years at different high schools in L.A. and the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena until she started having memory problems. She once appeared as a dream analysis expert on ""The Marilu Henner Show."" She began showing symptoms of memory loss a decade ago, but it took several years to get an official diagnosis of Alzheimer's, her husband, Joseph Sr., said. Joe Fraley moved in with his parents to help care for them. Judy Fraley moved to the assisted living facility a few days after the video was shot and since then has gone rapidly downhill. Fraley said hundreds of people have written to him, sharing similar stories of what they've gone through and how the video reminded them of their parents. Somebody sent him a painting of Fraley and his mom, just based on the video. Fraley has documented other touching moments throughout his mother's illness, including the last thing she ever wrote and a poignant photo essay of his dad giving his mom her wedding ring at her new home in the assisted living community. In August, his parents will have been married 50 years. The song he plays in the video was written years ago, before his mother was diagnosed. ""It's about being really close to somebody and having them no longer there with you,"" he said. ""I wrote it about a girl, but it ended up being about my mom."" Fraley's dad said the video and the world's response is the only positive thing to come out of an awful disease that's stolen his wife and so many other people. ""I like the idea that Judy will get recognized because she's such a wonderful person,"" Joseph Sr. said. ""She's the most wonderful person I've ever known."" The support from people who've watched Fraley's video has been so encouraging to him and his family that he said he will continue to play at his mother's assisted-living facility, even after she passes away.","Joe Fraley has been performing his music for his mom for as long as he's been playing .

"(CNN) -- Once again, the streets are electric with anger after a white police officer evades charges for fatally shooting a black man. Sirens screech and wood batons push back marchers protesting from Missouri to New York to Los Angeles. This time the cadence of ""No Justice, No Peace"" has been replaced with ""Hand's Up. Don't Shoot."" But there was another sign raised above the crowd in a recent protest in New York: ""Doing Nothing with Saying Nothing. Changes Nothing."" The mathematics of this one are clear. Something's gotta give. A loose network led by African Americans in the film and arts world has emerged from the fog of tear gas to call for a quiet riot in response: a boycott of Black Friday shopping. Ryan Coogler, who directed the 2013 film about police brutality called ""Fruitvale Station,"" told us he was confounded by the eruptions of ""human rights violations committed by public servants."" ""There are three ways you can express yourself,"" Coogler said. ""You can vote. You can protest. You can choose how you spend your money that goes to America's corporations that hold a lot of power."" ""We've got to fight the powers that be!"" proclaimed Public Enemy's Chuck D in 1989. With the embers of Ferguson still smoldering, it is clear that the struggle continues. But by taking their purchasing power away on retailers' favorite day of the year, the voice of blacks in America, and their allies, may echo more loudly in its absence from shopping malls and big box stores. Earning less than whites and unemployed at more than double the national average, African Americans still have $1 trillion in buying power, according to Nielsen. They spend more on media, watch more television, shop more frequently off and online and spend more on beauty products than any other ethnic group in the country. That is serious sway. People who make movies also have sway -- people such as Ava DuVernay, director of the upcoming film ""Selma"" and actors Michael B. Jordan (""The Wire"") and Nate Parker (""The Secret Life of Bees""). #BlackOutBlackFriday has even produced its own minifilms to fuel this modern version of the bus boycotts. One of them features an interview with the daughter of Eric Garner, who describes losing her father to police violence. Garner was choked to death by police who suspected he might be selling ""loosies"" or loose cigarettes. In his grand jury testimony, Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson said the man he shot to death, Michael Brown, might have been suspected of stealing ""cigarillos"" at a convenience store. Our own contribution to this tragically revived conversation is the Starfish Media Group documentary ""Black and Blue"". It includes Garner's story and other shocking videos and stories of police brutality. The #BlackOutBlackFriday videos alone make the case for change. ""Social media and the technology, with respect to camera phones, empowers every single person who has access to a device,"" Parker told us. These are the kind of media people could be watching ahead of Black Friday, rather than falling prey to commercial plugs to shop. The outcry over police brutality can't end with the Thanksgiving news cycle. President Barack Obama can't just promise to take a look -- yet another look -- at how the police interact with the public. Public frustration over policing didn't boil over only because of Michael Brown's death. It did because of the daily indignities that have become common for black people. These boycott organizers feel that helplessness as they watch the police violence spinning out of control and don't know how to stop it. It's not like you can dial 911. To Darren Wilson, who shot Michael Brown ""the whole thing started over 'will you just walk on the sidewalk.' "" Then suddenly the man he called a ""demon"" was dead, he washed his hands of blood and stowed his gun. He faced no judicial accountability after 25 days of grand jury investigation. A 2013 Pew Research Center survey showed that 7 of 10 blacks felt they were being treated less fairly than whites by police. A Gallup poll that same year found that nearly 25% of all black males from ages 18 to 34 reported being treated unfairly by police in the past 30 days. ""This is not a one-day thing,"" DuVernay told us. ""What #blackoutblackfriday is trying to do is to create ongoing pressure to change the conversation among conscious people of all colors."" They might achieve more by opting out of the system than by opposing it. Your presence is sometimes felt by your absence.","Soledad O'Brien, Rose Arce: Instead of Ferguson violence, blacks can use economic power .

"The ubiquitous red envelopes will endure, but they will carry a new name. Netflix is rebranding its 12-year-old movies-by-mail service as Qwikster and adding video games to its catalog, Reed Hastings, the company's CEO, announced Sunday night. The Web-streaming portion will continue to be called Netflix, he wrote on the company's blog. After the separation, people who subscribe to both services will have to log into two separate websites, Netflix.com and Qwikster.com, to manage their movie queues and account information, Hastings wrote. Customer reviews and ratings from Netflix will be ported to Qwikster for the launch, but after that, people will have to rate and search for movies on each site separately, he wrote. Qwikster's site currently presents a landing page that says it is ""launching soon."" Hastings did not offer a timeline for Qwikster's debut. Andy Rendich, the operations chief and 12-year veteran of the company, will run the new mail-order arm. In addition to DVDs and Blu-ray discs, the new service will offer console games for Microsoft's Xbox 360, Nintendo's Wii and Sony's PlayStation 3 for an extra monthly fee. The change will put pressure on GameFly, a competing service dedicated to subscription game mailings. ""Members have been asking for video games for many years, and now that DVD by mail has its own team, we are finally getting it done,"" Hastings wrote. Responding to a question in the blog post's comments, he wrote, ""Old Fogey discs will last a long time."" Another person questioned whether Netflix was setting the DVD business up to be sold off later and asked how long until that would happen. ""A long time,"" Hastings replied. ""We know the business better than anyone else."" Dish Network, which recently acquired Blockbuster in a bankruptcy auction for $320 million, is believed to be unveiling a revamped movie-streaming service on Friday. Netflix also faces competition from Hulu, YouTube and an array of new entrants. Netflix customers were incensed in July when the company announced that it would stop bundling the streaming service for free with DVD-by-mail plans, effectively increasing the price for some by as much as 60%. Hastings finally offered an apology, not for the price hike but for failing to clearly communicate why the change was being made. ""It is clear from the feedback over the past two months that many members felt we lacked respect and humility in the way we announced the separation of DVD and streaming, and the price changes,"" Hastings wrote. ""I messed up. I owe everyone an explanation."" Hastings has worried for the last five years that Netflix will fail to successfully adapt its business to growing opportunities, such as online video streaming, he wrote in a rare public admission for the savvy Netflix co-founder. He said he hoped to avoid similar fates to Borders Group, the bookstore chain that filed for bankruptcy this year, or AOL, the dial-up Internet king that is struggling to transform itself into an online media company after a nasty corporate breakup from Time Warner, which is the parent company of CNN. ""In hindsight, I slid into arrogance based upon past success,"" Hastings wrote. ""Both the Qwikster and Netflix teams will work hard to regain your trust. We know it will not be overnight."" In a video explanation, he clarified the company's reasoning for the changes, saying, ""DVD and streaming were becoming more and more different, and we could do a better job for both services if we separated them."" While Netflix is not going back on the price changes from earlier this summer, customers should not expect further increases, Hastings wrote. In his response to a comment on the blog, he said the adjustment was designed to help Netflix improve the quality of movies and TV shows available on the streaming service, which many say is lacking.","Netflix's DVD-by-mail service will soon be renamed Qwikster .
Qwikster will begin offering console games at a premium .
Netflix streaming and Qwikster will operate independently ."
"(CNN) -- CNN has won an Amnesty International Media award for its documentary World's Untold Stories: Locked up and Forgotten. The winning half-hour film, presented by CNN's Nairobi correspondent David McKenzie, highlights the negligence and social taboos suffered by Kenya's mentally disabled community, who live a life hidden away in slums and remote villages across the country. Deprived of medical care and therapy, an estimated three million mentally disabled individuals are ostracized by society, concealed and locked away inside their own communities, often by their own families. Watch the documentary Lost and Forgotten . When it first aired on CNN the documentary sparked widespread debate, bringing the plight of Kenya's mentally disabled to the forefront of the world's media, leading domestic and international human rights groups to call for government intervention. McKenzie said: ""It's fitting that the Amnesty International logo is a candle because it is an honor and a privilege to be awarded this prize for a documentary that shines a light on the shocking state of mental health in Kenya and beyond."" The Amnesty International Media Award jurors praised the program for putting the issue high on the media's agenda and subsequently bringing the matter to the attention of Kenyan government, who have called for change. ""David McKenzie took an unknown story and brought it to the attention of the world, testament that hard hitting journalism can incite global change,"" CNN International Managing Director Tony Maddox said. ""It is an honor to have your journalism recognized by Amnesty International as powerful enough to truly make a difference."" The award is the World's Untold Stories strand's second win in the International Television and Radio category since it first aired on CNN in 2009. In 2009 the strand took the award with The Forgotten People for its expose of the on-going persecution of the ethnic Rohingya people in their bid to escape terrible privation in Myanmar -- formerly Burma -- and in neighboring countries.","CNN documentary highlighted plight of mentally disabled people in Kenya .

"A rigorous green certification system is recognizing the next phase of eco design, which its founders describe as ""the world's greenest buildings."" Founded by Jason F. McLennan in 2006 through the Cascadia Green Building Council, the Living Building Challenge (LBC) is a green ratings system for design and construction that judges a building based on its actual performance, not just its projected performance at the design stage. To date, it has recognized six buildings for their green credentials. Only three have been successful in meeting all its stringent requirements and consequently fully certified as ""living."" ""These are the world's greenest buildings,"" says McLennan. ""It is a huge leap forward from conventional green construction. These buildings will never get an energy or water bill again."" Projects must be in operation for a minimum of 12 months before they become eligible to participate in the challenge and they can only achieve ""living"" status after fulfilling requirements in the categories of site, water, energy, health, materials, equity and beauty. ""It takes about 14-16 months to go through the certification process and we are a rigorous process so there are not that many buildings fully certified,"" says McLennan. Read more: The greenest buildings of 2011 . He adds: ""The ones that are (certified) are game changers because they become more than a building. They create a whole community of changed people around them."" The International Living Future Institute, a non-profit that was created to take over running the LBC since its inception, hopes its guidelines will change current green construction philosophy and become as powerful as eco-building ratings system Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, or LEED as it is better known. But unlike LBC, LEED does not certify new buildings based on measurements of their actual performance. McLennan says: ""You'd be surprised no green standards actually go and check if the project is fulfilling what they had planned to do. We knew in reality buildings typically don't perform the way they are intended so we wanted to rectify this and base our challenge on reality."" The LBC was created to encourage the creation of living buildings, sites and communities globally as well as educate people about the importance of going green. The non-profit has been working closely with projects and regulatory bodies to aid experimental green design construction.

It has already been recognized as a credible contender in green building standards by winning global design competition The Buckminster Fuller Challenge earlier this month. In the official statement, the jurors said the ""Living Building Challenge successfully shows how humans and their built environment can be harmoniously, benignly integrated within ecosystems. ""Above all, its rigorous standards and daringly innovative, revolutionary approach to building are already having a considerable impact on the thinking of designers and architects around the world, influencing all levels of design and technological approaches, radically pushing forward the field."" Read more: 'Vertical farm' blossoms at meatpacking plant . McLennan seems somewhat surprised by the rapid recognition and success the LBC has had internationally. He says: ""Without any international marketing budget, we've launched something bigger than ourselves. We have become a meme in a way -- an idea that develops its own legs and begins to travel."" Initially starting with projects in the United States and Canada, the green performance-based ratings system now has registered projects in Australia, France, Lebanon, Mexico, and New Zealand, amongst others, and interest from like-minded groups in Colombia, Ireland and Romania. ""We hope to be training certifiers in those countries,"" says McLennan. ""In Australia, we have three projects that are underway. We are in discussions with many leading thinkers about ideas working to create the Australian institute. ""They would be the governing body for the Living Building project tied into a global network of ambassadors, collaboratives and institutes around the world for the transformation of society ... It's about changing the world and building a network of people.""","The Living Building Challenge is a performance-based green ratings system .

"(CNN)The newest additions to Monaco's royal family, month-old baby twins Gabriella and Jacques, made their first appearance before their subjects Wednesday. Their parents, Prince Albert II and Princess Charlene of Monaco, presented them to a crowd of flag-waving onlookers from the balcony of the royal palace. Each carrying a baby swaddled in white blankets, the proud couple smiled and waved as the crowd cheered and applauded, while church bells rang and a military band played. The infant royals appeared to sleep through the event, for which a public holiday was declared. The twins were born on December 10 at the Princess Grace Hospital in Monaco, a tiny principality bordered on three sides by France and on the fourth by the Mediterranean Sea. Gabriella Therese Marie arrived in the world two minutes ahead of her brother. But in line with Monaco's rules of succession, Jacques Honore Rainier was named the Crown Prince and his sister next in line to the throne after him. The first pictures of the royal babies were released on the royal family's official Facebook account on December 23. ""A beautiful Christmas gift to Monaco, friends of the Principality of Monaco and the royal family,"" said the post. One of the tiny additions to the royal family wears a pink babygrow and the other a blue one. Royal twins born in Monaco . The twins are the first children born to Charlene Wittstock, a former South African Olympic swimmer who married Prince Albert II in 2011. Prince Albert, 56, also has two children born out of wedlock in 1992 and 2003 who are not in line for the throne. He succeeded his father, Prince Rainier III, as Sovereign Prince of Monaco on his death in 2005. At 2.02 sq km (77 sq miles), it is the second smallest state in the world, after the Vatican, and about half the size of New York's Central Park.

"(CNN)A youth player for Russian club Anzhi Makhachkala was shot dead in Russia's North Caucasus in the early hours of Sunday morning. Gasan Magomedov was driving towards his family's home when his vehicle came under attack from a ""volley of automatic gunfire,"" according to a statement on the clubs website. The 20-year-old's parents heard the gunfire and rushed to discover their wounded son who died on his way to hospital. The club added that the local police have yet to determine any motives or suspects. The attack took place in Dagestan, a region of Russia that has recently become the focus of Islamist insurgency.  For years, Anzhi's leading players lived and trained in Moscow and only went to Dagestan for home games. Anzhi's general director Sergey Korablev said, ""we console with Gasan`s family. I hope the law-enforcement bodies will efficiently detect the murderers, who will receive just punishment. ""Despite of the efforts to destabilize the situation, we`ll keep on living and working for the only purpose -- peaceful Dagestan."" Over recent years, Anzhi competed for the Russian Premier League title and attracted star players like Samuel Eto'o, Willian, and Roberto Carlos. In 2014, however, the club was relegated to the country's second tier after billionaire owner Suleman Kerimov withdrew his financial backing and many star players left.","A youth player for Russian club side Anzhi Makhachkala was shot dead Sunday .

"A great football team combines inherent violence with a certain order, always imposed by the coaches and team leaders.  Famed Green Bay Packers coach Vince Lombardi allowed very little humor and made it abundantly clear that there would be no racism in his organization. Regardless of intent, any racist remark by a player was deemed malicious and resulted in instant dismissal from the team. The culture was established at the top. Leaders like Willie Davis were the enforcers in the locker room, along with Lombardi's ""War Council,"" a group of hand-picked players who communicated directly with him. The Miami Dolphins would have done well to take a page from Lombardi. On Wednesday, the Dolphins fired offensive line coach Jim Turner and head athletic trainer Kevin O'Neill. It was the latest flareup in an ongoing, ugly controversy over bullying, leadership and NFL locker-room realities, one that has some of the characteristics of a wildfire:  The slightest breeze ignites it for a fresh run over highly flammable terrain. And now the heat has reached the top floor: The firings apparently came at the behest of team owner Steve Ross, who, news reports said, conducted his own investigation into the treatment of Jonathan Martin by fellow player Richie Incognito and others -- and the role their teammates, coaches and front office have played in the Dolphins' locker room culture. That's significant, since owners normally leave such issues to coaches. The Dolphins melodrama is a sad story of too much smart-ass talk and not enough supervision.  The team's leadership should have laid down specific guidelines regarding acceptable discussion of race and gender preference and about outright harassment.  This was clear from the beginning.  The team has suffered, and from the trainer to the owner, everyone -- literally everyone -- is affected. It should have never gotten this far. Whether Ross' firm action this week is sufficient to restore order to the Dolphins is open to question, since players have weighed in on both sides. Someone should have shut the guys' mouths on day one. Normally, that would come from within the team and coaches. I have a long view on this culture. Last fall marked the first season in 58 years that I was not employed full-time in a football job. Fourteen of those years were spent in the NFL -- 10 as a player (including with Lombardi's Green Bay Packers) -- and I wake up each morning with painful reminders. They seem a small price to pay for having competed in the greatest team sport ever devised. With all the sometimes absurd chatter over the Dolphins' story, it must be difficult for thinking people to know or understand how the team's situation could have developed. Maybe I can add perspective -- to explain, if not to completely excuse. Football is the only sport in which every player needs every teammate on every play just to survive. Simply put, everybody matters. Football locker rooms are loaded with alpha males, and daily conflicts are inevitable. My sensitive, scholarly friend, writer George Plimpton, joined us with the Baltimore Colts when we were Super Bowl champions and actually played four plays against Detroit in Ann Arbor before 104,000 fans. As we left the field, he turned to me and said, ""That is the most disgusting experience in my life! You guys are deranged! I have never felt such palpable hatred in my life!"" I said ""That was not hatred; it was intensity. We are competitors!"" He was inconsolable, and our argument continued until he decided we should do a book about the subject (""One More July""). Here are the fundamental and immutable truths that escape many media analysts and others: . • When you watch an NFL game, you are observing angry young men smashing each other with all their might on every snap of the ball.  And each generation of players is bigger, faster and stronger than the one before. • Football is not a contact sport. It is a collision sport.  That is the essence -- indeed, the whole point -- of the game. • College football is a petting zoo. The NFL is a jungle. When players cross the white lines in the NFL, they take on the persona of the gladiator. The intent is to destroy the opponent's will, to dominate him, to beat him into submission. There are no nice guys on game day. • Some players can exit the field and resume life as decent human beings: kind, reverent and socially aware. Some cannot. Their unresolved anger issues are too dominant and manifest in often dangerous ways.  For these players and former players, there is no equivalent in civilian life to the catharsis of two hours a day of physical combat. • The only people who understand a specific locker room are those who lived or live there. When I moved to Don Shula's team in Baltimore, for example, I was surprised to learn that there was much more laughter than in my previous locker room. The team motto was ""If you can't take a joke, bleep you!"" Only we didn't say ""bleep."" Everyone was fair game, especially superstars like John Unitas. The great John Mackey literally stripped his britches off down to jock once, in the middle of practice with several hundred spectators, because Tom Matte had planted a cicada in his pants. Everyone laughed, including Mackey. Shula smiled but quickly restored order, reminding us that we had better execute if we wanted the fun to continue. If practice deteriorated, Shula stuck that jaw out, and our safety valve, Dan ""Sully"" Sullivan, would say, ""Cut the crap. He's not smiling."" I really feel that Shula's phenomenal record was due in part to his ability to allow for some nonsense from time to time and because we had people like Sully, who became his surrogates in the huddle. There was only one Lombardi, and there is a reason the Super Bowl trophy bears his name. There will never be another Shula. Every organization must have its own ethos and standards that are hammered into the men's consciousness every day as the team's complex mix changes with waivers, injuries and trades. Players often feel that they are fighting for their lives. There must be constant reminders of the focus. When the team wins, everybody benefits. Individual players with differences should be expected to take care of business in private or on the field -- like the men they claim to be.","Bill Curry: Vince Lombardi wouldn't tolerate racism in locker room; culture set at the top .

"(CNN)When Andy Roddick played tennis, the grand slam winner and former world No. 1 never shied away from conversing, or arguing with chair umpires. The American famously blew up at the Australian Open in 2008 in a five-set loss to Philipp Kohlschreiber, telling the crowd in Melbourne: ""Stay in school, kids, or you'll end up being a chair umpire."" By no means was it the lone outburst of his career. Having retired in 2012 and now watching the game as a pundit, Roddick, perhaps unsurprisingly, says there is not enough interaction between players and umpires. His solution? Roddick would scrap Hawk-Eye or severely alter the system currently in place. ""This is completely different to what I thought as a player, but I would get rid of the challenge system,"" Roddick told CNN's Open Court on the sidelines of the charity event Mylan WTT Smash Hits in December. ""I feel like we've lost a lot of our personality. If someone is really having a go at the umpire, you are not going to change the channel. It's an impossibility. ""It's about eyeballs on TV sets,"" he said. The overwhelming majority of players currently on the tennis tour have welcomed the instant replay system, which was first introduced at a top-level tennis tournament late in 2005. By that time, Hawk-Eye had already been used in cricket, with football's Premier League subsequently adopting Hawk-Eye to help determine whether goals have been scored. Roddick -- a big sports fan who touches on several sports in his role for Fox Sports in the U.S. -- isn't alone in his dislike of Hawk-Eye. Roger Federer, the 17-time grand slam champion who could be labeled a traditionalist, asked Hawk-Eye to be switched off during the 2007 Wimbledon final against arch-rival Rafael Nadal. And two years ago in Dubai, the Swiss told reporters: ""What I like without Hawk-Eye is just the players challenging the umpires more often."" He did add, though, that he got the ""point"" of Hawk-Eye. ""We love our guys in the game now, Roger, Rafa and the way they carry themselves but there's some entertainment value on the guys that don't carry themselves so well,"" Roddick said, mentioning himself, retired two-time grand slam winner Marat Safin and the man dubbed 'Super Brat,' John McEnroe. ""Johnny Mac is out here all the time still going nuts and people love it,"" said Roddick, referring to the 55-year-old McEnroe competing in seniors' events. Enric Molina, a former elite umpire who was in the chair for grand slam, Davis Cup and Olympic finals, didn't entirely disagree with Roddick. Molina officiated before Hawk-Eye and then when it was implemented at tournaments. ""I think Hawk-Eye is a great addition to the game, because the fans love it, and at the end of the day, the players have a chance to make sure the calls are right,"" Molina, the CEO and founding partner of sports management company Big Match Player, told CNN.com. ""From an umpire's point of view, this is very satisfying because the worst feeling you have in the chair is when you think you've made a mistake and there's nothing you can do about it. ""But having said that, I see where Andy is coming from. It has taken away the discussion, the element of confrontation between the players and umpires, and that may be a sad thing of course for some fans -- but not necessarily for those in the chair."" If discontinuing Hawk-Eye is too harsh, Roddick suggested limiting the number of challenges in a match to one. The challenge would remain an option so long as the player is proved right when going to the instant replay. Currently in matches where Hawk-Eye is employed, players are allowed three incorrect challenges per set, plus one more in a tiebreak. Another change in the game Roddick would make is keeping play going when there are lets. For Roddick, the entertainment factor is indeed key. ""We are fooling ourselves if we don't think sports are entertainment,"" he said. ""The first goal is winning and that's where you have a job. I am not saying we parade around and go all Hulk Hogan and enter the court in feather bows or anything, but if we play tennis with regular umpires forever and a day and it worked -- it wasn't like it was broken at all.""","Andy Roddick says he would abolish or significantly alter the challenge system in tennis .

"(CNN)The way things have gone for the U.S. men in downhills in Italy this month, they probably wish every race could be held there. After Steven Nyman won one of skiing's classics in Val Gardena about a week ago, Travis Ganong claimed the opening victory of his career by bettering the field in Santa Catarina -- a venue long known on the women's circuit but making its debut among the men. The course shortened due to high winds and bad visibility, Ganong took advantage and won in a time of one minute, 32.42 seconds. He was 0.09 seconds faster than Austria's Matthias Mayer and 0.21 seconds faster than home favorite Dominik Paris. ""It was a perfect run,"" Ganong told the U.S. ski team's website. ""I love to take on a new challenge and a new slope. I love the hill -- the mountains are huge here and it's fun skiing. ""I went really, really straight in a couple areas. It was really smooth and I was able to carry it all the way down. The last big carousel turn I did perfectly -- I don't think I could do that again if I tried. ""Hopefully this will keep going all year. My New Year's resolution is to do this more often."" Nyman finished 15th, two spots better than Kjetil Jansrud of Norway. Jansrud, though, maintained his lead in both the downhill and overall standings. First win for Hector, too . Ganong wasn't the lone racer to capture a maiden victory Sunday, as Sweden's Sara Hector triumphed in a women's giant slalom in Kuhtai in Tirol, Austria -- new to the World Cup tour. In second heading into the final run behind American Mikaela Shiffrin, Hector attacked the course and made up the 0.27-second deficit. Austria's Anna Fenninger moved up to second, with Shiffrin -- whose specialty is the slalom -- dropping to third. ""It's not easy to put words on such emotions right now,"" Hector was quoted as saying by the FIS website. ""To be on top of the podium is so special."" Fenninger solidified her spot in second in the overall standings behind Tina Maze -- who tied for seventh Sunday. Fenninger is also second in the giant slalom standings, trailing compatriot Eva-Maria Brem. A lack of snow in Semmering, Austria, prompted the move to Kuhtai in Tirol.","Travis Ganong wins his first downhill by claiming top spot in Santa Catarina .

"(CNN)Yeah, yeah, we know that hot cocoa's great (hello, brandy hot chocolate is a thing), but winter is the only season when you can jump around in snow like a little kid and not look like a drunken fool. Turn off the ""Law & Order"" reruns, put on your marshmallowy-est puffy jacket, and go outside! Here are our six recommendations for snowy competitions to watch or compete in, if you're brave enough to try. Autonomous Snowplow Competition, Minnesota (January 22-25) Shaping and carving snow is one thing, but actually dealing with the thick blankets covering the ground is an art in and of itself. At the fifth annual ION Autonomous Snowplow Competition in St. Paul, Minnesota, the event coordinators have cleverly made a competition that is actually exciting and entertaining out of just cleaning up snow. Competitors -- often college students -- design, develop and build their own snowplows. And if that isn't impressive enough, the machines must be controlled electronically during the competition. Each snowplow navigates a course and clears a designated path in the snow. Visitors can watch in awe (and maybe with just a teensy bit of jealousy) as the teams are judged on their creations' designs, presentations and performances. Cannington Dog Sled Races, Canada (January 24-25) The Cannington Dog Sled Races are the perfect event for any snow lover or dog lover. If you prefer to keep the beasts at a safe distance, you can appreciate their power and agility while watching them speed through the snow. If giving plenty of cuddles and kisses is more your speed, head over to the petting zoo for a more personal experience. The Ontario race is open to everyone: professional racers, kids and teams with mixed breed dogs. If this show of speed and control still doesn't impress you, watch the skijoring races, where people must not only balance on skis but be simultaneously pulled across the snow by dogs. It's very impressive to those of us who can't even manage to get the knack of ""normal"" skiing. U.S. National Snow Sculpting Competition, Wisconsin (January 26-31) If you see a blank sheet of snow as merely fodder for a massive snowball fight, the 2015 U.S. National Snow Sculpting Competition in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, will blow your mind. At this prestigious event, artists showcase their ability to tame blocks of snow into stunning masterpieces. They work with ladders and scaffolds to gently carve and smooth their blocks until the image within shines through. The single-block sculptures are larger than life, often standing even taller than the artist, but they must fit within a 12-foot circle. These sculptors are the best of the best. The winners of each state competition come to Lake Geneva to vie for the winning title. The winner also receives an invitation to compete in the Association International de Sculpture sur Neige et Glace-sanctioned Snow Sculpting Competition. Alpine World Ski Championships, Colorado (February 2-15) If you're one of those Winter Olympics fans who has to catch each mogul and every exhilarating run down the slopes, just imagine how incredible it would be to watch it all in person. At the 2015 FIS Alpine World Ski Championships, you will be able to admire every snowflake and gasp along with the crowd -- and every devastating wipeout -- as the world's most talented skiers navigate the slopes. Even if skiing isn't really your thing, the town of Vail will be the perfect winter wonderland during early February. Musical phenoms Michael Franti & Spearhead, Phillip Phillips and American Authors will all be performing during the championships. Spend your free moments sampling Sierra Nevada beers at the Winter Beer Camp or checking out the International Experience Celebration, where each new day brings a whole new spread of international food and drinks. U.S. National Toboggan Championships, Maine (February 6-8) At the U.S. National Toboggan Championships, the competitive tobogganing is a far cry from what most of us did sliding down our driveways on old cardboard boxes. Here, the competition is fierce, and many of the sleek toboggans are handcrafted to ensure the fastest runs possible. Although watching other people whiz down steep hills on small wooden planks is certainly entertainment enough, the town of Camden is offering a bevy of other kinds of entertainment during the weekend of the championship. Test your culinary prowess at the Chili Challenge, show your creative talents during the Costume Contest parade, and snuggle around the bonfire. For older guests, the 2nd Eva Down the Chute Beer & Wine Tasting is the perfect way to mix the magic of snow and the magic of alcohol. Taste a cornucopia of beers and wines, and vote for your favorite brewer as the alcohol keeps you from feeling the snow's frosty bite. World Wheelchair Curling Championship, Finland (February 6-13) Perhaps you've watched curling teams compete in the Winter Olympics and thought to yourself, ""Really? That's a sport?"" But just add a wheelchair into the equation, and the whole thing gets infinitely more impressive and more captivating. At the World Wheelchair Curling Championship in Finland, that's just what you'll see. Only one new rule sets the wheelchair athletes apart from the traditional curling competitors: no sweeping. Besides that, every skill and strategy is the same.","Winter weather shouldn't keep you from competing out of doors .
One Canadian dog sled race is available to novices and experienced competitors alike .
This tobogganing is more than sliding down your driveway on a cardboard box ."
"Marc Marquez continued to redefine sporting perfection after the Spaniard won the German MotoGP -- his ninth successive victory of the season. Remarkably Marquez won the race from the pit lane, racing through the pack and going past early leader Stefan Bradl with 24 laps left to finish ahead of Honda teammate Dani Pedrosa, with Yamaha's Jorge Lorenzo in third. One of 14 riders that chose slick tires at the last minute after the warm up lap, Marquez had to start from the pit lane, meaning he had to wait until the bikes on the grid and on dry tires had motored past. ""It was tough and when I saw Bradl changing tires at the beginning. I thought that was the right choice because there was only one corner that was completely wet,"" said defending champion Marquez. ""Everyone went in (to change tires) including my main rivals -- Dani (Pedrosa) and Valentino (Rossi). ""When I saw them go in, I followed but it worked out OK,"" added the Spaniard . Marquez has now won a perfect 225 points this season, 77 points ahead of compatriot Pedrosa, with Italian Valentino Rossi in third, 84 points adrift. Rossi finished Sunday's race in fourth.","Marc Marquez dominates German MotoGP to win ninth successive race of the season .

"Bayern Munich has honored the remarkable life of its former president Kurt Landauer, who was hounded out of office 80 years ago by the Nazi regime and sent to a concentration camp. During four terms as president of the German football club, Landauer is credited with establishing Bayern as an international force and nurturing the club's youth policy. The legacy of Landauer,  who served as a soldier for the German army in World War I but was later imprisoned in Dachau, is to be remembered by the club, who has named him as Bayern's third honorary president. ""This accolade is long overdue,"" said club president Uli Hoeness during a presentation to Landauer's nephew Uri Siegel, his only surviving relative. ""For my uncle, there was only ever FC Bayern,"" Siegel recalled on the Bayern Munich website. Landauer was born into a Jewish family in 1884 and at the turn of the 20th Century was playing for Bayern Munich's youth team. His football career was cut short when he left for Switzerland to train as a banker but when he returned to Munich he was soon elected as president of Bayern in 1913. The outbreak of World War I interrupted Landauer's term and he left to serve in the German army. After the war, Landauer again took up the post of club president in 1919 and it was during this period he established his legacy with the club. Founding father . ""The president, who favored investment in the team rather than the construction of a stadium demanded by a section of the membership, rates to this day as one of the founding fathers of the club's widely-admired youth policy,"" explained Bayern Munich's website. Bayern also won their first domestic title under Landauer's tenure in 1932. But the following year with the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany and its extreme anti-Semitic policies soon brought a dark shadow over the club's achievements. The Nazi authorities branded Bayern a ""Jewish club"" and the club lost team members and fans, and fell back in the national rankings. Landauer resigned the presidency and in 1938 he was arrested and sent to a concentration camp. His service as a solider during World War I meant he was released after 33 days and he left for Switzerland. However, his three brothers all died under the Nazi regime, while his sister Gabriele was deported and is still officially listed as missing. Auschwitz goalkeeper . Landauer returned to Munich in 1947 and resumed presidency of his beloved Bayern in 1947 to 1951. He died 10 years later at the age of 77. The former youth player and four time club president has joined player Franz Beckenbauer -- star of the team which won three European Cupss in the mid-Seventies --  and former president Wilhelm Neudecker as Bayern's only honorary presidents. ""His efforts were pioneering during an extremely difficult time for FC Bayern,"" Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge recalled in 2009. ""He experienced things which so many people unfortunately experienced in those times. We must do everything necessary to prevent times like that happening ever again. ""Remembrance is a vital component in that."" In Britain, a former prisoner of war, Ron Jones, has also detailed his painful memories of football under the Nazi regime in a new memoir. The 96-year-old recounts his experiences in the Auschwitz death camp where he and fellow British soldiers formed a football team. His story has been published in a 2013 book called The Auschwitz Goalkeeper.","Bayern Munich name Kurt Landauer as one of its three honorary club presidents .

"The gunman who killed at least two people and then himself in an office building in southern California is a 48-year-old man from the nearby town of Norco, authorities said Saturday. He was identified as Andre Turner. Those slain Friday were Henry Serrano, 56, of Walnut, California; and Robert Lindsay, 53, of Chino, California, the Los Angeles County coroner's office said. The building is occupied by Southern California Edison, one of the nation's largest electric utilities, serving almost 14 million people, according to a company statement. The victims were employees from Southern California Edison, as was the gunman, the company said in a statement Saturday. ""This is one of the most horrible days in our company's history,"" Ted Craver, chairman and CEO of Southern California Edison, said in a written statement Friday. More than 200 employees work in the building, mostly in information technologies, utility spokesman Gil Alexander said. ""This is, of course, first and foremost a tragedy, and our thoughts and prayers go out to the families affected,"" Alexander said. ""We're all anxious to find out what happened."" Two nearby schools, Walnut Elementary School and Olive Middle School in Irwindale, went into lockdown during the incident, said Laura LaTurno with the Baldwin Park superintendent's office.","The gunman was also an employee of Southern California Edison, company says .

"(CNN)Oscar Pistorius was a ""broken man"" following the death of his girlfriend, a psychologist said Monday, as the defense used a sentencing hearing to persuade the judge of his fragile emotional state. Lore Hartzenberg said the Olympian described his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, as the right person for him. But the prosecution slammed her findings, calling them unobjective. ""We're dealing with a broken man -- but he's still alive,"" Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said in apparent reference to the fact that Steenkamp is not. ""He has lost his love relationship ... but he will be able to love somebody else like that,"" Nel said. The onetime South African sporting hero was found guilty of negligent killing last month in the 2013 death of his girlfriend. He returned to court Monday for a hearing that will determine whether he's going to prison. Judge Thokozile Masipa, who presided over his high-profile trial and delivered the verdict last month, will decide his sentence. Pistorius was found guilty of culpable homicide, the South African term for unintentionally, but unlawfully, killing a person. However, Masipa cleared him of murder in the killing of Steenkamp, a model and law school graduate. He was granted bail pending the sentencing hearing. The hearing is likely to take several days, as both prosecution and defense will have the chance to put their arguments and evidence before the court. There is no legal minimum or maximum sentence for culpable homicide under South African law, so it will be up to the judge to decide. A typical sentence is five to eight years. But it is a principle of South African law that the sentence should be tailored to the culprit as a whole person, as opposed to the crime. That makes predicting a sentence difficult, said Kelly Phelps, a CNN legal analyst. The judge also found Pistorius guilty of one weapons-related charge involving a shooting at a restaurant. The maximum penalty for that is five years behind bars. But he could get a lesser sentence, such as a fine or the loss of his gun license. It's likely that a pre-sentence report will be presented to the court, which may recommend a sentence -- although the judge is not bound by it. Also, both the prosecution and defense probably will tell the court what they consider an appropriate sentence to be. Prison life? If Pistorius is sent to prison, it's not clear whether his disability will allow him any special treatment. And daily life behind bars likely would not be easy. Born with a congenital abnormality, he had both his legs amputated below the knee before his first birthday and uses prosthetic limbs to get around. The carbon-fiber blades he used to compete on the track -- before Steenkamp's killing abruptly halted his running career -- earned him the nickname ""Bladerunner."" During his trial, his defense highlighted his vulnerability when on his stumps, while a court-ordered psychiatric assessment found that he was depressed, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and a suicide risk. South Africa's prisons, meanwhile, are notorious for their overcrowding, which puts a strain on sanitation, ventilation and medical care for inmates. Pistorius would likely receive far better treatment than the average prisoner, as he has throughout the judicial process, said Nooshin Erfani-Ghadimi, project coordinator for the Johannesburg-based Wits Justice Project, a civil society group. Even so, she said, it will not make much difference. ""I don't think anyone with a disability necessarily will be able to be provided for at the moment in a way that ensures that they would have the correct medical treatment, that they have the correct physical structures,"" she said. Steenkamp was model and law graduate with 'wicked' sense of humor . 'Conduct was negligent' Pistorius, 27, has always admitted firing the bullets that killed his girlfriend Steenkamp, 29, a cover model about to turn reality-TV star. He pleaded not guilty to murdering her on Valentine's Day last year, saying he mistook her for a burglar in his home and the killing was a tragic mistake. But in grabbing his gun and heading toward the supposed threat, Pistorius ""acted too hastily and used excessive force,"" Masipa ruled last month. ""His conduct was negligent"" and not what a reasonable man would do in the circumstances -- not even a disabled one, she said. Defense arguments about his upbringing in a crime-riddled environment might explain his conduct that night, but it does not excuse it, the judge said. ""The accused had reasonable time to reflect, to think and to conduct himself reasonably,"" she said. Who is 'Blade Runner' Oscar Pistorius? Appeals process . Pistorius can appeal the verdict or the sentence, potentially to the Supreme Court of Appeal and even eventually to the South African Constitutional Court. The state can appeal only if it believes the judge misinterpreted the law in reaching her verdict. The right to appeal depends on whether, based on the facts of the case, the initial judge or magistrate believes a different court could possibly reach a different verdict. The Constitutional Court was once just for cases regarding constitutional matters, but a recent act of South Africa's Parliament broadened the court's responsibilities. Steenkamp's mother stunned by verdict, wants to meet Pistorius . CNN's Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report.","Oscar Pistorius will be sentenced by Judge Thokozile Masipa .
She cleared him of murder, but found him guilty of culpable homicide .
There is no legal minimum or maximum term for culpable homicide .

"Silviniaco Conti completed the double at the King George VI Chase at Kempton Park in the style of which former stablemate and steeplechase legend Kauto Star would be proud. The Boxing Day race is second only to the Cheltenham Gold Cup in terms of prestige for elite horses over the fences and the 15/8 shot justified his favorite tag with a superb front running display. It came on the day a statue in honor of five-time winner Kauto Star was unveiled at the London track, both horses trained by Paul Nicholls, who has now saddled the winner nine times in the King George. Kauto Star has turned to equestrian sport and dressage since his retirement from racing, memories of his dominance still fresh in the memory. But Silviniaco Conti was just as sure footed over the big fences to win ahead of 7-1 chance Dynaste, while another Nicholls runner Al Ferof, was third for the second successive year. Fancied Irish runner Champagne Fever faded to finish fourth under jockey Ruby Walsh after running too strongly in the opening stages. Irish jockey Noel Fehily was on board the winner and could not hide his delight after such a clear cut victory. ""He has proved what a very good horse he is,"" said Fehilly. ""He has done it the hard way."" Meanwhile Nicholls was left to marvel at his continued success in the King George. ""Amazing to have nine winners in the race!"" said Nicholls. ""He was really good today. I have been really impressed with him this year. He's in a good place this season.""

"It's only as I'm inviting my friend to lunch that I realize the prospect might not sound that appetizing. ""There will be a murder,"" I say. ""Someone will die."" Surprisingly undeterred, he agrees to meet me at London's Victoria Station the following week and it's only once we're standing on the platform amid a rapidly swelling crowd that he starts to look a little worried, nervously asking: ""Who are all these people?"" We're being joined by a diverse crowd on our lunch date, which is probably only to be expected since we're booked in for an afternoon of fine dining with an extra helping of homicide. That's the menu on board the Murder Mystery Lunch train, a luxury rail ride around the English countryside that pitches passengers into a cloak and dagger world worthy of Agatha Christie -- but with greater quantities of champagne. Many of our fellow diners -- some celebrating anniversaries or birthdays -- are entering into the spirit, dressed in 1920s flapper dresses, gangster suits or as extras from ""Downton Abbey."" It's hard to say whether the passing commuters are doing double takes at this oddly attired throng or at the train: the magnificent Belmond British Pullman. Golden age of travel . This king of the railroad is -- appropriately for a trip that'll involve murder -- a sister to the Orient Express and its 11 gleaming carriages that channel the spirit of a golden age of travel. Amid this eccentric crowd, a portly gentleman dressed all in gray stands out more than others. The double-breasted suit, the hair, the hat are gray. As is the cat cradled in his arms which, he tells us with a perfectly straight face, is called Pussy. ""Pussy isn't real, you do realize that?"" says Mr. Gray as I tickle his stuffed feline under its chin. Mr. Gray is the first of a string of actors we meet, each stopping by like an old pal for a chat, exchanging cheeky repartee and dropping clues. Before we can meet any more of the cast, we're shepherded on to our carriage. It has plenty of dark wood, polished brass, art deco finishing and plush armchairs. On the table, between the silverware and crystal-cut wine glasses, is a sheet of paper -- one side is printed with an incomprehensible set of clues, the other is blank for us to take notes. There's also a section for us to name the suspect and their motive. After all, this afternoon isn't just about getting tipsy before sundown -- there's a murder to solve. We don't have to wait long for the killer to strike. The train has barely left Victoria Station when a woman stumbles into our carriage and declares, ""I've been stabbed!"" 'Don't panic!' She screams, flails about and then staggers out the carriage, giving us a good view of the dagger sticking out of her blood-splattered back. We have our victim. The stabbed woman's cries can still be heard as a dashing young man called Matt storms into the carriage, shoves a gun in my face and shouts: ""There's been a murder. Don't panic!"" It's hard not to laugh. At times the acting is as hammy as a deli counter. There are, however, more somber moments along the journey when we get to question characters, including a detective, a newspaper reporter and the head of British intelligence agency MI5, about what's going on. The champagne makes it easy to slip into this whodunit on wheels. Bubbles before noon always feels decadent, but the added buzz from the mix of murder, mystery and a 170-mile journey quickly goes to the head. ""Don't bother looking out the window, it's the same view as on the cheap train,"" quips the train manager as he passes through the carriage making polite conversation. We mistake him for one of the cast and begin grilling him on the murder before realizing that he is in fact the real train manager. Despite what he says, it's worth taking in the view as the train rolls through the county of Kent, a rural corner southeast of London known as the garden of England because its rolling landscape of farms and coastline has long supplied some of the country's best crops. Back in the carriages, lunch arrives and the waiting staff appear to be in on the game, making quips about the suspects without letting anything slip. Life-changing event . The five-course meal that began with murder finishes with a cheese platter. By now everyone is putting forward their theories, some wilder than others, in the hope of winning a take-home bottle of champagne. An enthusiastic young American comes up with an elaborate theory involving a tin of paint that surprises the world-weary detective. ""I've been doing this six years and I've never heard that one,"" he remarks. An older honeymooning couple, both on their third marriage, have conflicting suspicions. She thinks it's Mr. Gray's daughter, he suspects the head of MI5, but each group can only nominate one suspect. He backs down and goes with her suggestion -- a man with the wisdom of two marriages behind him. By the time train slips back into Victoria Station everyone is swaying slightly as though disembarking from a boat. The young American wins the champagne -- nothing to do with paint -- and farewells are said as though we'd shared a life-changing event. And we had: we dined, we drank and someone died. The next Murder Mystery Lunches on the British Pullman are on October 2 and November 13, departing Victoria Station at 11: 45 a.m. Tickets cost £510 ($833) including a five-course lunch with champagne and wine; +44 845 077 2222 .","Murder Mystery Lunch train departs London's Victoria station for a trip around rural Kent .

"Former F1 champion Michael Schumacher has been discharged from a Swiss hospital and is returning to his home, where he'll  continue his recovery from head injuries suffered in a skiing accident last year, his spokeswoman said Tuesday. ""Considering the severe injuries he suffered, progress has been made in the past weeks and months,"" said Sabine Kehm. ""There is still, however, a long and difficult road ahead."" Schumacher, 45, sustained severe head trauma in a skiing accident at the French Alps resort of Meribel on December 29. His investigative team said it thinks the experienced skier hit a rock hidden beneath the snow while traversing an area between two marked pistes, which catapulted him face-first onto another rock. He was treated first at a hospital in Grenoble, in France, and then in June moved to a hospital in Lausanne, Switzerland, near the Schumacher family home. Kehm appealed, as she has previously, for the privacy of his family to be respected as Schumacher continues his recovery.

"(CNN) -- If Larry Flynt has his way, Casey Anthony could reintroduce herself -- nude -- to America on the pages of Hustler magazine, and make well over $500,000 in the process. The pornography magnate told HLN's ""Nancy Grace"" show on Thursday night that talks are ongoing that could land Anthony on the pages of his magazine, weeks after a Florida jury acquitted her of murder in her 2-year-old daughter Caylee's death. Flynt insisted he was serious about the offer, which he said would include $500,000 up front plus 10% of all profits. He said any payment that the Orlando woman might receive for interviews with media outlets would be ""chicken feed"" compared to what she'd receive by appearing in Hustler. ""If they want to get their hands on big money, they've got to go through me,"" Flynt said. Anthony's trial in Orange County became the fixation of countless people during its seven-week run, many horrified by the girl's death and others drawn in by the family drama. Since her release from jail early on the morning of July 17 -- after getting credit for time served for her conviction on four counts of misleading authorities -- she has remained out of the public eye. The Hustler magazine founder said that, after a jury cleared the 25-year-old woman on murder charges, he initially did not consider reaching out to her. But Flynt said his mind changed after being approached by ""droves of men"" as he was touring the country promoting his new book ""One Nation Under Sex."" ""They said, 'Why haven't you made an offer? Why don't you want to publish her pictures?' "" Flynt said. ""They said, 'She's a really attractive person' ... I've never seen that happen before."" Asked whether the decision might be distasteful to the many who feel Anthony got away with murder, Flynt said his tour suggests to him that there was a real demand. He also claimed that a portion of any proceeds would go to charities aimed at addressing child abuse. Flynt noted, too, that he has ""never been one to shy away from controversy,"" boasting on HLN about printing nude photos of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in 1975. ""You've got men who say hey, I want to see her in her birthday suit,"" he said of the Anthony offer. ""There may be some sick individuals ... but that's what life is all about."" Earlier this month, Playboy founder Hugh Hefner said he got a similar flood of requests from people encouraging him to try to get Anthony for his magazine. But he shot down any possibility that would happen. ""It is amazing the number of people that have tweeted me immediately afterward, asking whether or not we would do a pictorial on her,"" Hefner told CNN's Piers Morgan. ""And the answer is simply no. I wouldn't reward someone like that for what has happened."" Mark Lippman, the attorney for the woman's parents, George and Cindy Anthony, said he had no knowledge that his clients had talked with their daughter since her acquittal -- including about this offer. Both parents testified at her trial, with defense lawyers claiming that George Anthony helped cover up his granddaughter's death. ""This is all news to me,"" Lippman told HLN. ""And obviously, Casey is her own person, and she's making her own decisions.""","The deal also includes 10% of all profits, the porn entrepreneur says .

"New York State is poised to allow 20 hospitals to distribute medical marijuana, Gov. Andrew Cuomo formally announced Wednesday. ""Research suggests that medical marijuana can help manage pain and treatment of cancer and other serious illnesses,"" Cuomo said in the annual State of State speech in Albany. ""We will establish a program allowing up to 20 hospitals to prescribe medical marijuana, and we will monitor the program to evaluate the effectiveness and the feasibility of a medical marijuana system,"" Cuomo added, without elaborating. Medical marijuana advocates briefed on Cuomo's plan earlier this week said an executive action would allow certain hospitals to dispense the drug to certain patients. The governor's office did not return calls seeking comment. State Assemblyman Richard Gottfried, a Democrat from Manhattan and a leading proponent of comprehensive legislation for medical marijuana, said he learned about the executive action in a conversation Saturday with members of the governor's staff. He said the move paved the way for a ""limited and cumbersome program"" but called it a step forward. Other New Yorkers welcomed the news. Missy Miller of Long Island said she considered moving to California to gain access to a special strain of marijuana called charlotte's web oil, a derivative that may help cease her son Oliver's seizures. Oliver, 14, had a stroke in utero that resulted in a brain stem injury.  Among several other life-threatening consequences are seizures, sometimes more than a dozen a day. ""It's scary every day,"" she said. ""Every seizure that he has, I get anxious, every seizure I worry, is this going to be the seizure that doesn't stop."" Miller has hoped for comprehensive legislation that would specify the sources and strains of the drug available. Access is ""a huge question mark,"" she said, adding that while other states have legalized marijuana, ""they do not have the strain that will help these children."" Miller said that while Cuomo's announcement is ""a huge step and a step in the right direction and we're applauding it, it isn't enough. It needs to include access and coverage to the people that need it, all the people that need it."" An opponent of the governor's action said it was driven by politics. ""I think serious questions can be raised about using a political vehicle to achieve the use of a prescribable medication in America,"" said William Foster, president of the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependency. Medical marijuana is not unprecedented in the United States. Twenty states and the District of Columbia now allow it in some form -- among them Colorado, where, as of January 1, it's legal to sell marijuana to those 21 or older -- according to information compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures. (In addition, Maryland has a limited program for research.) The momentum has picked up recently, with most of these efforts taking effect over the past decade. Among the states that allow medical marijuana are Connecticut, Vermont and New Jersey, each of which border New York. And yet the Empire State has not joined them. Versions of the Compassionate Care Act pushed by Gottfried have passed the state Assembly, only to stall in the Senate. Cuomo is acting without the legislature's OK, though what he's doing is legal, according to Gottfried. He explained that the governor is acting on powers granted through a law passed in 1980 in setting the stage for a highly regulated system that's less liberal than many other medical marijuana setups nationwide. Here's how it would work, according to Gottfried: Under Cuomo's directive, the state health department would take charge by setting up the guidelines and picking the hospitals that would participate. These hospitals would then have panels of people who decide, on a person-by-person basis, which patients qualify for medical marijuana. It has yet to be determined where the medical marijuana -- or the elements of it that might be dispensed -- will come from, including who might produce it. Gottfried estimated that tens of thousands of people could get medical marijuana by virtue of this policy change, though he insisted it is no substitute for a more complete, far-reaching program. ""(Cuomo) can take (this step) without the need for further legislation,"" the Manhattan legislator said. ""But to have a truly comprehensive and well-working system will take legislation.""","New York's governor announces plan to distribute medical marijuana .

"Former F1 driver Michael Schumacher is no longer in a coma and has been transferred from a hospital in Grenoble, France, where he had been admitted after a skiing accident last year, his management said in a statement Monday. ""Michael has left ... to continue his long phase of rehabilitation,"" according to his manager Sabine Kehm. He will continue his recovery at the University hospital in Lausanne, Switzerland. Officials there confirmed that Schumacher was admitted, but gave no further details about his treatment. Schumacher, 45, suffered severe head trauma in a skiing accident at the French Alps resort of Meribel on December 29. A seven-time world champion whose F1 career ended in 2012, Schumacher has been treated in Grenoble since his accident. In early January, a French prosecutor investigating the accident said that speed was not a reason for Schumacher's fall. His investigative team said it thinks the experienced skier hit a rock hidden beneath the snow while traversing an area between two marked pistes, which catapulted him face first onto another rock. Schumacher ended up 9 meters (30 feet) from the edge of the piste, prosecutor Patrick Quincy said. Footage from a small camera attached to Schumacher's helmet has been used to help the investigators' analysis. As in previous statements, Schumacher's agent asked the media to respect the privacy of the F1 legend's family. ""The family also wishes to thank all the people who have sent Michael all the many good wishes,"" Kehm said. ""We are sure it helped him. For the future we ask for understanding that his further rehabilitation will take place away from the public eye.""","Michael Schumacher transferred to a hospital in Switzerland for rehab .

"His family is devastated. The woman he planned to marry, haunted by the ""what ifs."" And many are wondering why Thomas Eric Duncan died when several other Ebola patients treated in the United States survived. Duncan was hospitalized eight days after he arrived from Liberia, and later tested positive for Ebola. He died Wednesday, but not much is known about his medical history. Here are seven ways his case differs from other patients in the U.S.: . 1. Duncan wasn't hospitalized right away . Unlike the American patients, who were quickly tested and quarantined at the first sign of Ebola, Duncan wasn't. Duncan arrived in Dallas from Liberia on September 20, and he made his initial visit to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on September 25. He was treated for a fever, vomiting and abdominal pain -- all symptoms of Ebola. But he was sent home with antibiotics and was not screened for the virus. Relatives say he told hospital staff he'd come from Liberia. Three days later, he was hospitalized in worse condition and was quickly isolated. He became the first case of the deadly virus diagnosed on American soil. ""What if they had taken him right away? And what if they had been able to get treatment to him earlier?"" said pastor George Mason of Wilshire Baptist Church in Dallas. 2. He didn't get an experimental drug immediately . Duncan received experimental medicine on October 4 -- six days after admission to the hospital. It was a far longer wait than four other Ebola patients treated in the United States. Those patients -- two each at Atlanta's Emory University Hospital and the University of Nebraska Medical Center --  got experimental medicine immediately. They're all U.S. citizens; Duncan was a Liberian. His family is claiming bias, arguing it took too long for him to receive the medicine. ""It is suspicious to us that all the white patients survived and this one black patient passed away ... He didn't begin his treatment in Africa. He began treatment here, but he wasn't given a chance,"" said Josephus Weeks, his nephew. Not so, the hospital says. ""The investigative drug was administered as soon as his physicians determined that his condition warranted it, and as soon as it could be obtained,"" Texas Health Presbyterian said  Thursday. Since the drugs are still experimental, individual hospitals have to file the paperwork with the Food and Drug Administration for permission to use them. The agency received the request to use the experimental drug brincidofovir  on October 3, five days after Duncan entered the hospital. 3. He got a different experimental drug . Duncan got brincidofovir. And he was the first Ebola patient to receive it, the hospital said. Two of four patients who survived after treatment in the U.S. received a different drug, ZMapp. Experts say there's no proof that ZMapp or any drug is effective in treating Ebola. A Spanish priest infected with Ebola died after taking it in August. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Duncan didn't get  ZMapp because its stocks were depleted. A third American patient received TKM-Ebola -- another experimental drug approved by the FDA recently for wider use. The  fourth one, NBC cameraman  Ashoka Mukpo, who got infected in Liberia and was airlifted to Nebraska on Sunday, got the same drug as Duncan. Ebola drugs are in the works . 4. He didn't get a blood transfusion from an Ebola survivor . Unlike other American patients, Duncan didn't get a blood transfusion from someone who'd survived the virus. That's because doctors couldn't find a match, the hospital said Thursday. ""Mr. Duncan did not receive the same type of serum transfusion as the patient in Nebraska (Mukpo) because his blood type was not compatible with the serum donors,"" the hospital said. Mukpo received a transfusion from Dr. Kent Brantly, who survived the virus. 5. The hospital treating him had no advance notice . The Atlanta and Nebraska facilities knew in advance they were expecting Ebola patients, a crucial element for a disease so rare in the United States. Hospitals that took care of the four are also  among the most well-equipped nationwide to battle the deadly virus. Despite lack of notification, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital said Duncan got top-notch care and his medical team consulted daily with the CDC and Emory. 6. Information on his case has been muddled . Details on Duncan's background have not been as clear-cut. His relatives said he made it clear to the hospital that he had just come from Liberia. His symptoms pointed at Ebola, they said. Initially, the hospital said Duncan was ""not exhibiting symptoms specific to Ebola"" when he first went to the hospital. And, they said, details about his travel history weren't communicated to doctors. But later, it said a flaw in electronic records had kept doctors from seeing his travel history. Then it said his travel history had been documented and was available to his care team. 7. Family believes his insurance status played a role . Duncan had just arrived from Liberia to visit his girlfriend and son, and probably had no insurance. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who's serving as a spokesman for the family, said that was a concern. ""I would tend to think that those who do not have insurance, those who do not have Medicaid, do not have the same priorities as those who do,"" the civil rights leader said. But the hospital denied the claim. ""Our care team provided Mr. Duncan with the same high level of attention and care that would be given any patient, regardless of nationality or ability to pay for care,"" the hospital said. ""In this case that included a four-hour evaluation and numerous tests. We have a long history of treating a multicultural community in this area.""

"(CNN)Andrae Crouch, a seven-time Grammy winner and gospel music legend, died Thursday at a Los Angeles-area hospital, his publicist said on his  website. Crouch was 72 and had been hospitalized at Northridge Hospital Medical Center since Saturday. While Crouch was well-known for his gospel work with his choir, the Disciples, he also produced and arranged songs for pop artists such as  Michael Jackson. No cause of death was given. Crouch revolutionized gospel music in the 1970s, giving it a power and verve that propelled him out of the church and into the mainstream, although he really never left the church either. ""Crouch was an innovator, a path-finder, a precursor in an industry noted for its conservative, often derivative approach to popular music,"" Robert Darden wrote for Christianity Today.  ""He combined gospel and rock, flavored it with jazz and calypso as the mood struck him and the song called for it."" Some of Crouch's best-know songs are ""My Tribute,"" ""The Blood Will Never Lose Its Power"" and ""Soon and Very Soon."" Often called ""the father of modern gospel music,"" Crouch  was inducted into the Gospel Music Association Hall of Fame in 1998 and his songs have been covered by artists as varied as Bob Dylan, Elton John, Barbara Mandrell, Paul Simon, Elvis Presley and Little Richard.

"(CNN) -- Images believed to be of China's next generation of military air power have been buzzing around the internet, but Pentagon officials are insisting it does not mean China has matched American air capabilities. The new Chinese stealth fighter jet, known as the J-20, isn't supposed to be operational until at least 2017, but a Chinese air force commander told Chinese TV in 2009 that flight testing would begin much sooner. Stealth jets, such as the United States' F-22, are designed to evade detection by radar and anti-aircraft defenses. Now unknown sources have posted photos of what appears to be the plane on an airfield runway in southwestern China. ""We are aware of their plans to develop this fifth-generation fighter,"" Pentagon spokesman Col. Dave Lapan said Wednesday. ""The photos that were released recently are presumably of some taxi testing."" At a Thursday briefing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei declined to comment on reports on China testing the jet. ""China insists on a path of peaceful development,"" he said. ""We have adopted a national defense policy that is defensive in nature and do not threaten any other countries. China has been an important force in maintaining regional and global peace."" The emergence of the photos comes as Defense Secretary Robert Gates heads to China this weekend to discuss the military relationship between the U.S. and China. And later this month, President Hu Jintao will go to Washington for a summit with President Barack Obama. One China watcher says Beijing's failure to censor the grainy images on the web proves the photos are of the new jet and the country wants them to circulate. ""The Chinese military and the police could have swept the area around the airfield very easily, but what they've done is they've controlled this. They've allowed Chinese to only take photos with cell phones, meaning that the photos that we have are low-resolution, do not give us a great deal of detail about the aircraft and they're put on the web with a low-resolution format,"" said China military scholar and author Richard Fisher. ""The response within China has been overwhelmingly positive and has spurred national pride to an enormous degree."" The Pentagon is taking a low-key approach to the surge in publicity about the Chinese fighter, saying their existing top-of-the-line warplane has engine problems and that their next plane is years away. But Fisher says that timeline could be sped up if the Chinese buy an engine from Russia as opposed to developing it themselves. ""It's something that is in some form of development, as a fifth-generation fighter. As I noted, the Chinese are still having difficulties with their fourth-generation fighter,"" Lapan said in an off-camera question session with journalists in his office. And he said that while the new jet was not mentioned in the Pentagon report on China that was sent to Congress in August as an annual update for China's defense capabilities, the Defense Department has talked about it. ""We as a department have publicly spoken about it in the past. It is not as if we have not acknowledged that they are pursuing a fifth-generation fighter,"" Lapan said. ""So we are aware of it. But it is not of concern that they are working on a fifth-generation fighter."" Fisher, however, says it should be a concern, citing the Chinese jet's potential ability to overtake that of America's F-22 in thrust and ""supercruise"" speed, which is the ability to fly supersonically without using fuel-guzzling afterburners. ""We can't say precisely what the capabilities are, but we have a good idea. Right now, we should be reviving production of the F-22 and not just reviving production, we should be developing an advance version of the F-22,"" said Fisher. ""And sadly, even though it is a troubled program, already the F-35 needs another rework. It needs to be made competitive with this fighter."" The F-22 was scaled back in production in 2009. The production of the F-35, which is being developed and tested, could be slowed under Gates' budget-cutting initiative. In 2009, Gates said that no nation comes close to the United States' air power, and he anticipated the Chinese having only ""a handful"" of fighters that challenge the U.S. advanced fleets by 2025. But Fisher cautions that this Chinese jet could cause a change in the balance of power in the Pacific. ""Since World War II, the American military has never gone into battle without the assurance of air superiority. China is a rising power, and it is determined to challenge the American position globally,"" said Fisher. ""This fighter will allow them to do that on a military level... and from my perspective, that's simply unacceptable."" CNN's Steven Jiang in Beijing contributed to this report.","Grainy web images of what is believed to be a new Chinese fighter jet create a stir .

"(CNN) -- At least 26 bodies have been recovered from the sea after a Libyan trawler got into trouble last week, but hundreds are still missing, according to Tunisia's state-run TAP news agency. Bad weather is preventing the recovery of more bodies, the head of the Sfax coast guard told TAP Monday. The agency did not name the official. As many as 270 Libyan refugees were missing in the Mediterranean Sea after the overcrowded boat they were in encountered bad weather, the Tunisian state-run TAP news agency reported last week. The Tunisian coast guard responded to the rescue call regarding the fishing trawler, which became disabled Wednesday night near the Kerkennah Islands. The ship was reportedly taking some 800 refugees from Libya to the Italian island of Lampedusa, TAP reported. Between 200 and 270 people were missing, while 577 people were rescued, the coast guard official told TAP Monday. People on the boat began pushing each other in a panic to reach the lifeboats when they ran into high waves and winds, TAP said. Lampedusa, the closest Italian island to Africa, has become a destination for tens of thousands of refugees seeking to enter the European Union. More than 30,000 migrants and refugees from Tunisia and Libya have risked this dangerous journey to Lampedusa since last February. Lampedusa and Malta, both islands less than an hour's flight from the North African coast, have borne the brunt of the subsequent wave of migration. At one point, the population of migrants vastly outnumbered Lampedusa's residents, who number about 6,000.","26 bodies are recovered, a coast guard official tells Tunisia's state news agency .

"(CNN) -- My dad told me real men don't hit women. He believed that because men were physically stronger and mentally tougher, men had the obligation to shield women from harm. I didn't buy the mentally tougher part, but I did embrace the idea that men were born with a kind of wonderful genetic code that made it impossible for them to pummel any woman, least of all a woman they cherished. I believed this all the way through grade school and high school. I believed it until my college boyfriend, in a jealous rage, threw me against the wall and knocked me out. It only happened once, but I remember how it felt. I always thought I was a physically strong woman, but I could not defend myself against a man who outweighed me by 70 pounds. Which brings me to star running back Ray Rice. When video emerged of the Baltimore Ravens player dragging his unconscious fiancÃ©e from an elevator, I thought the whole world would be horrified. I thought the National Football League would come down hard on Rice. Rice indicted on assault charge . I was wrong. Rice will sit out two games and pay a fine. It reportedly will cost the multimillionaire athlete $529,411.24. The Ravens' head coach, John Harbaugh, summed it up this way on ESPN: . ""It's not a big deal. It's just part of the process. We said from the beginning that the circumstances would determine the consequences. There are consequences when you make a mistake like that. I stand behind Ray. He's a heck of a guy. He's done everything right since. He makes a mistake. He's going to have to pay a consequence."" (In May, Rice pleaded not guilty to one count of third-degree aggravated assault and was accepted into a pretrial program for first offenders.) Plus, come on! The guy went to counseling and married his victim, for goodness sake. Say what? In a wonderfully headlined post, ""The NFL Thinks Smoking Weed Is Eight Times Worse Than Beating a Woman Unconscious,"" the website sports.mic contrasted Rice's situation with that of Josh Gordon, a wide receiver for the Cleveland Browns, who ""is facing a 16-game suspension ... for testing positive for marijuana ..."" Actually this strange kind of ""justice"" meted out by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell doesn't bother me as much as what the Ravens posted on their Twitter feed. According to whoever tweets for the Ravens, Janay Rice herself ""deeply regrets the role she played the night of the incident."" Perhaps the new Mrs. Rice really does feel that way, but the Ravens' ""helpful"" tweet is as tone deaf as John Harbaugh's Rice ""made a mistake/he's a heck of a guy"" comment. Ayonna Johnson, director of legal services for the Women's Resource Center to End Domestic Violence, says, ""When it comes to ... professional sports, unfortunately we're still in a male-dominant society."" A girlfriend or a wife, she says, ""has to bend themselves down, bend herself lower, and make her partner and her love interest shine a little brighter."" Even when her manly, wealthy, successful husband is clearly wrong. Put more bluntly, take the blame, Honey, you probably deserved it. I don't say that lightly. After my boyfriend knocked me out, I expected my friends to rally around me. Most did not. ""He's such a nice guy,"" they told me in disbelief. ""You must have made him really mad. You say some mean stuff. He really loves you."" ESPN's Stephen Smith played the role of my callous former friends on his show, ""First Take."" He assured his audience that, PERSONALLY, ""as a man raised by women,"" he knows full well there's never an ""excuse to put your hands on a woman,"" except, that is, when you must. Smith blathered, ""We also have to make sure that we learn as much as we can about elements of provocation."" In other words, Ladies, don't provoke your man or he'll deck you. Smith's colleague -- and my new hero -- Michelle Beadle tweeted, ""I'm thinking about wearing a miniskirt this weekend ... I'd hate to think what I'd be asking for by doing so."" Smith tried to apologize, but the damage was done. Perhaps the NFL will try to apologize too, but again, the damage is done. So, Mr. Goodell, a few facts for you to ponder for the future: According to safehorizon.org, one in four women will experience domestic violence during her lifetime. One-third of female homicide victims are killed by their current or former partner. According to the Coalition Against Domestic Violence, boys who witness domestic abuse are twice as likely to abuse their own partners and children when they become adults. It's why I thank God every day I married a man whose father was as old-fashioned as mine. Gordon Snyder taught his sons a slightly different version, though. Gordy said, ""A man who hits a woman never hits a man."" Are you listening, Mr. Goodell?","Baltimore running back suspended for two games after domestic violence incident .

"After more than 800,000 Puerto Rican voters said they want the island to become the 51st U.S. state, the White House is calling on lawmakers to take action. ""Congress should now study the results closely, and provide the people of Puerto Rico with a clear path forward that lays out the means by which Puerto Ricans themselves can determine their own status,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters this week. Last month's statehood referendum in Puerto Rico was nonbinding, but it was the first time such a measure garnered a majority of votes; 61% of voters who cast ballots on that question said they supported the island commonwealth becoming a U.S. state. Critics say the two-part plebiscite on Puerto Rico's status was unclear and doesn't accurately represent the will of the island. Even the White House hasn't been clear about what the vote means, they say. ""Democracy should never be used to confuse people. ... I'm sorry they are confused in the White House,"" said Puerto Rican Sen. Eduardo Bhatia of the Popular Democratic Party. The first ballot question asked Puerto Rican voters whether they supported the island's status as a U.S. commonwealth; 54% of them said no. In response to the second question, which asked voters to select an alternative, 61% of those who cast ballots chose statehood, but more than 480,000 people abstained from voting on that question. ""They could have voted for statehood, if they had really supported it,"" said Maria de Lourdes Santiago, senator-elect for the Puerto Rican Independence Party, which supports the island becoming its own sovereign republic. ""When you combine all the votes, statehood doesn't appear as the true winner in the second question about non-colonial options."" One thing is clear, the White House spokesman said Monday: Puerto Ricans ""want a resolution to the issue of the island's political status."" Congressional action in Washington would be necessary for Puerto Rico to become a state. Statehood has long been a thorny issue in Puerto Rico, with political parties sharply divided over the matter. Those who support statehood say last month's vote is a sign that change is coming, despite what critics say. ""If they don't want to pay attention to it, let them not pay attention,"" said Kenneth McClintock, Puerto Rico's secretary of state. ""But the White House is paying attention."" A law passed in 1917 made Puerto Ricans U.S. citizens. But the Caribbean island's roughly 4 million residents cannot vote for president . Under its status as a commonwealth, Puerto Rico is subject to U.S. federal laws, though island residents are exempt from some federal taxes. Puerto Rico has a nonvoting representative in Congress. After last month's referendum, McClintock said an economic downturn and shrinking population contributed to the support for statehood, where as referendums in 1967, 1993 and 1998 failed. ""I think people just came to realize that the current relationship simply does not create the number of jobs that we need,"" he said. An exodus of residents from the island has culminated in a staggering statistic: 58% of Puerto Ricans live in the mainland United States, McClintock said. ""When you have a political status that scares away half of your population,"" he said, ""it is time to reject that political status.""","The White House says Congress should respond to last month's plebiscite .

"Campus Republicans at the University of California Berkeley have cooked up a storm of controversy with their plans for a bake sale. But it's not your everyday collegiate fundraiser they've got in mind.  They've developed a sliding scale where the price of the cookie or brownie depends on your gender and the color of your skin. During the sale, scheduled for Tuesday, baked goods will be sold to white men for $2.00, Asian men for $1.50, Latino men for $1.00, black men for $0.75 and Native American men for $0.25.  All women will get $0.25 off those prices. ""The pricing structure is there to bring attention, to cause people to get a little upset,"" Campus Republican President Shawn Lewis, who planned the event, told CNN-affiliate KGO.  ""But it's really there to cause people to think more critically about what this kind of policy would do in university admissions."" Lewis says it's a way to make a statement about pending legislation that would let the California universities consider race or national origin during the admission process. But the young Republicans have been on the receiving end of a fierce backlash.  Reaction has been so negative they've been forced to cancel their customary lunchtime tabling duties, according to KGO. Lewis told CNN's Don Lemon that they expected a certain amount of opposition but not the level of outrage they experienced. ""We didn't expect the volume, the amount of response that we got,"" Lewis said.  ""In the first few hours, hundreds of posts on our Facebook page.  And the tone of some of the responses -- we expected people to be upset.  We didn't expect personal threats to be made.  They were implicit and explicit threats made to the organizers of the event, from burning down the table to throwing our baked goods at us and other kinds of physical threats."" Tim Wise, author of the book ""White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son,"" calls the bake sale a ""sarcastic and rather smarmy slap at people of color."" ""There are a lot of ways to make a point about your disagreement with affirmative action,"" Wise told Lemon Saturday night. ""I get the joke,"" he continued.  ""How very original.  It's been done for 15 years. The point that I think needs to be made ... is that by the time anyone steps on a college campus ... there has already been 12- to 13-years of institutionalized affirmative action for white folks, that is to say, racially embedded inequality, which has benefited those of us who are white.  And it's only at the point of college admissions that these folks seem to get concerned with color consciousness.""

"Germany's parliament voted Tuesday for Angela Merkel to serve a third term as the country's chancellor, this time at the head of a grand coalition government. The coalition is made up of Merkel's conservative bloc, her Christian Democratic Union party and the allied Christian Social Union, and the center-left Social Democrats. Merkel was re-elected by 462 votes in Germany's lower house, or Bundestag, with 150 votes against and nine abstentions, and was sworn in as chancellor soon afterward. Her Cabinet is also due to be sworn in Tuesday. The parliamentary vote came after members of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) overwhelmingly approved the coalition deal in a postal ballot. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso wrote to Merkel to congratulate her on her re-election, saying it ""constitutes both an endorsement of your past efforts and a signal of confidence for the coming years."" He added that he was looking forward to ""constructive and fruitful cooperation"" with the German government in the future, as the European Union continues its efforts to counter the effects of the global financial crisis. Merkel's election to another four-year term brings to an end nearly three months of uncertainty for Germany, the eurozone's economic powerhouse. Merkel emerged from September elections with the CDU's biggest vote in 20 years. But the CDU and CSU did not win an outright victory, requiring them to form a coalition government. The pro-business Free Democrats, Merkel's previous coalition partner, failed to pass the 5% threshold for getting into parliament, putting a grand coalition with the SPD, the CDU's chief election rival, in the frame. The coalition agreement, hammered out last month, includes a new nationwide minimum wage of 8.50 euros ($11.50) an hour beginning January 2015 and other measures favored by the SPD. Merkel's third term will give the country consistent leadership at a time when the future of the euro has come under question amid the economic problems of some eurozone members. While Germany has emerged from the crisis with its economy relatively intact, nations such as Greece have entered deep recessions while unemployment has soared.","Angela Merkel is sworn in for a third term as Germany's chancellor .

"Why play one sport when you can play two at the same time? That was the question a number of like-minded individuals were asking themselves, circa 2006. And it is thanks to the vision of these select few that the sport of FootGolf -- a game, unsurprisingly, combining elements of football and golf -- was born and has been spreading its way around the globe ever since. One of those men was Mike O'Connor, who today combines the roles of president of the Federation for International FootGolf (FIFG) and president of UK FootGolf. ""I just knew FootGolf would be a bit of a no-brainer for the amount of golf courses there are, as well as the number of golfers and footballers,"" O'Connor told CNN of a game that involves players kicking a football around a golf course, complete with bigger holes. ""I always thought it would take off. So it was just a question of waiting for the right time to get involved with it all really."" After years in production, O'Connor would bring the sport to the UK -- where there are now over 10,000 active players -- and set up UK FootGolf in 2012. Yet it is a Dutchman called Michael Jansen who is credited with the title of founding father of the game. ""He created what we do today,"" O'Connor said. ""He created everything, from how the game is played, down to the look of the players. Everything."" Kicking around a new idea . Jansen, now an FIFG ambassador, held the first FootGolf competition in the Netherlands in 2008, after hearing of a unique idea from friend and former professional footballer Willem Korsten. Korsten had played an early interpretation of the game during his days at Tottenham Hotspur, when he and his teammates would attempt to kick a football from the training pitch back to the changing rooms in as little time as possible. The mere invention of FootGolf seems to be a natural progression, given that football and golf have long shared a close relationship. Footballers are well known for playing golf in their spare time, so perhaps it is no surprise that FootGolf has proved such a hit with those hailing from a footballing background -- 70% of people who have taken up the sport have been footballers. While there is obviously the relaxing aspect of walking around a golf course on a sunny day, former English Premier League player Bryan Hughes also feels that the sport represents another opportunity for footballers to flex their competitive muscles. ""There is that challenge when playing golf. As sportsmen, we've all got that in our lockers. We want to challenge each other, we want to challenge ourselves and obviously be the best. That's why footballers turn to golf,"" he told CNN. ""It can be a challenge if you want, but I think it's good that you can actually have it as a casual game as well. Some footballers play golf but do it as a hobby, to relax and wind down, and escape from the pressures of a football match on a Saturday."" But while golf is in good health when it comes to attracting footballers, the sport has lost players in recent years -- According to a report in The New York Times, a recent survey by the U.S. National Golf Foundation estimated the game has lost five million in the last decade, with 20% of the existing 25 million golfers likely to quit in the next few years. Many feel the game takes too long to play, is too difficult to learn and has too many complicated rules, which has led to a number of new alternatives being introduced to help boost a sport in decline. Such concerns have led to the introduction on golf courses of 15 inch-wide holes -- about four times the width of a standard hole -- a relaxation in the game's rules, and of course, FootGolf. Gaining a worldwide foothold . Since Jansen's inaugural competition -- open to a mix of Dutch and Belgian professional footballers -- the sport has gone from strength to strength. Three countries formed the FIFG in June 2012 for the first ever World Cup in Budapest, Hungary, while today the world governing body boasts 22 different member nations, ranging from South Africa to Argentina. ""A lot of people are getting involved and loving the sport. It's definitely the fun element that attracts people to it,"" O'Connor said. ""It catches such a large demographic because it's such a low skill level to be able to play. You've just got to be able to kick a ball."" And it is the sport's ability to appeal to all that means a FootGolf course somewhere has likely played host to either a family visit, a first date, a corporate business trip or even, as was the case in the UK, an 81-year-old grandmother's day out with her grandson. But while there is little doubting the game's capacity to attract members from most walks of life, O'Connor feels luring newcomers at a young age is truly pivotal to FootGolf's future and its capability to grow as a sport. ""When I first set up FootGolf I knew a lot of people would want to play the sport, and I knew I wouldn't be alone in liking the idea of playing football on a golf course,"" he said. ""But I was always conscious of the next level. ""I knew it would take off with adults, but we started looking at how the sport could continue to grow and grow. And if you get the youngsters involved you're going to still be going in 10, 20, 30 years' time, and you'll be continuing to build, develop and progress."" Much to O'Connor's surprise, since its introduction, the sport seems to have struck a particular chord with junior football coaches. There has been an overwhelming response from these coaches, who have contacted UK FootGolf to explain that the game is the perfect way to help youngsters focus on their passing and shooting. So much so, that the governing body has taken the steps to set up its very own UK FootGolf Academy Scheme, due to start for business in May, and headed up by Hughes, who previously played for Birmingham City, Charlton Athletic and Hull City and is now a player-assistant manager at Scarborough Athletic. The scheme is currently being worked on with UK-based 1st4sport -- who develop training qualifications for the likes of the English Football Association and the English Rugby Football Union -- and will range from including holiday camps for kids to qualification courses for future coaches. Hughes will take on the role of academy director, and like O'Connor, he feels the scheme can help to push the boundaries of FootGolf even further. ""The concept of FootGolf is something that really appeals to me and I'm sure there is a massive amount of people that would really want to get involved with the Academy Scheme. The potential there is huge and it is something that I'm really looking forward to,"" Hughes said. ""I don't think a lot of kids get the right sort of education when it comes to sport, I think they just want to kick the ball against a wall nowadays. They need direction and for somebody to really push them a little, to get them right up there and become the best they really can be. The scheme will give you that platform."" As well as furthering the profile of the sport, the Academy Scheme will be hoping to produce some of the FootGolfers of tomorrow. A tour de force . The FIGC currently stages a European Tour, with each of its different 22 member nations holding their own tournament throughout the year. Some of the world's finest players go from competition to competition looking to accumulate points, before a European champion is eventually crowned at the final stage in Portugal in November. ""Players travel from country to country because they love FootGolf and they love trying different courses,"" O'Connor said. ""There's quite a small, but cult, following of people that do this. They all want to get ranked and be known as a good FootGolfer, not just in their own country but around the world."" There are also a number of domestic tournaments taking place each year on various courses across the globe. The U.S. currently leads the way when it comes to different courses with 90, while the UK, now boasting 30, has made impressive progress to move up to second, given it had just two at the beginning of 2013. With FootGolf continuing to make huge strides both at home and abroad, O'Connor has high hopes for the sport and feels the sky is most certainly the limit. ""In five years' time, every country in the world that has got golf courses will be a member of the Federation for International FootGolf,"" O'Connor said. ""With the amount of inquiries we are getting from all over the place, I have no doubt about that. ""We've got somebody in Togo asking us about joining the FIFG. They've only got one golf course in Togo, and they're talking about putting FootGolf on it! That's how big an impact the sport is having around the world.""

"German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative party won Sunday's parliamentary elections, but appeared to fall just short of obtaining a super majority, according to preliminary results released early Monday. Merkel's bloc -- the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (CSU) -- garnered 41.5% of the vote, according to semi-official results released by the Federal Election Office. Merkel's party was within two seats of obtaining a super majority, a majority greater than a simple majority of half-plus-one. The results appeared to validate Merkel's policies and leadership style as she has guided Germany through the Eurozone's economic crisis amid criticism that she has held back bailout help to struggling EU nations. ""This is a super result,"" Merkel, who was running in her third election, said in remarks to supporters at CDU headquarters that were televised. Read more: Angela Merkel: Europe's Mrs. Nein . ""It's too early to say how we will proceed,"" she said. ""But today we should celebrate."" It's a far cry from her first election in 2005, when Merkel's pre-election musings about tax increases went down badly with voters. She took office with a small plurality after her party was forced to build a coalition with her opponent's party, the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD). Merkel also took a hit in the 2009 elections amid German discontent over the country's role in Afghanistan. The only hiccup of the night Sunday appeared to be for Merkel's junior coalition party, which appeared to be coming up short with 4.8% of the 5% needed to remain in parliament, according to the preliminary results.

"Netflix users who stream video to their televisions will be seeing a major overhaul in the next few days. The company has announced what it's calling the biggest update ever for its more than 40 million streaming customers, rolling out a more visually rich design that will be the same regardless of what kind of device is used to bring videos from the Internet to the TV. ""This is the biggest change in how Netflix looks on a TV,"" said Chris Jaffe, Netflix's vice president of product innovation. Netflix says that the majority of the 1 billion hours of video its users stream each month is viewed on televisions, via TV apps or devices like the Roku, Blu-ray players or gaming consoles. Under the new format, which began rolling out Wednesday, clicking on a show or movie will call up a full-page description, with multiple images and an explanation of why Netflix recommended it for you. Descriptions of the videos will be sharper, Netflix says, and users who choose to let Netflix access their social-media profiles will get recommendations based on their activity and friends' activity, as well as on videos they've watched in the past. Until now, most versions of Netflix streaming looked like a relatively flat grid, consisting of row after row of suggestions based, generally, on what kind of videos had been streamed by the user in the past. ""The new interface, which has been two years in the making, is a visually striking departure from the familiar grid of movie tiles and boxes, and it is designed to be mirror the experience of TV watching: you click the remote and something happens,"" wrote Miguel Helft in Fortune. Other new features include expanded support for Netflix Profiles, a way to let people in the same household customize their experience, and support for voice controls on Xbox 360. Post-Play, the feature that automatically starts the next episode of a TV show you're watching or suggests others when you're done, also is being redesigned. Netflix says the update will take about two weeks to reach all devices, which include PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Roku 3, and new and future smart TVs and Blu-ray players. Some older smart TVs and Blu-ray players may receive the new look if manufacturers update them, and the overhaul will be added for the Roku 2 box early next year. One set-top box that won't be getting the update is Apple TV. That system has ""specific templates that are set by Apple,"" according to Netflix. Netflix says it has more than 31 million U.S. subscribers to its streaming service, plus almost 10 million international subscribers.","Netflix is getting more visual on TV with a major new update .

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Grass-roots fury rippled across Lebanon on Tuesday as a Hezbollah-backed politician got the nod to be the fractious country's new prime minister. Lebanon's president, Michel Suleiman, appointed Najib Mikati to lead the country's government, a step seen by supporters of caretaker Prime Minister Saad Hariri's Western-backed Future Movement as a power grab by the Iranian-backed Shiite movement. Mikati spoke shortly after his appointment, telling CNN that he is not Hezbollah's man and asking for time to prove himself in the new post. He suggested that one year would be a reasonable period in which to judge his leadership. Mikati's appointment came on the same day supporters of Hariri's called for a ""Day of Rage."" Hariri's government collapsed after Hezbollah withdrew its support for him this month. That came because of Hariri's cooperation with the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, which is expected to indict Hezbollah members in connection with the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, the father of Saad Hariri. Mikati said he is prepared to push ahead and form a government without Hariri if necessary. He refused to say whether he would support the ongoing investigation into the assassination of Hariri's father. Hariri urged demonstrators on the ""Day of Rage"" to show restraint and calm as protests sprang up across Lebanon amid the country's uncertain future. Speaking to his supporters in a televised address Tuesday, Hariri expressed regret about violence during the protests. He was making reference to confrontations between security forces and protesters across Lebanon and the attack on an Al-Jazeera news network crew and the burning of one of its trucks in Tripoli, in northern Lebanon. About 2,000 protesters gathered in Al Nour Square in Tripoli, Lebanese internal security forces said. Protesters burned tires along roads in the northern towns of Halba and Al Abdeh but had not blocked traffic, security forces said. Demonstrators were also beginning to gather in the southern port city of Sidon and across the capital, Beirut. CNN reporters in Beirut dodged rocks as 50 to 100 supporters of Hariri burned garbage containers in the middle of the street. Security forces stood by in armored personnel carriers and Humvees. A Lebanese army spokesman said the forces were raiding sites in Tariq Al Jadideh, in Beirut, in pursuit of people who fired gunshots during demonstrations earlier Tuesday. The spokesman said he anticipated arrests. Tuesday's demonstrations come on the heels of similar protests Monday as the political crisis unfolding in Lebanon for several weeks heated up. ""God, Hariri, Lebanon and nothing else,"" the crowd chanted. ""We will not allow (Syria) to come back and occupy us again. We will confront you with our souls, with our bodies with our determination so we can fail your schemes,"" said Mohammed Kabbara, a Sunni member of parliament from Tripoli. ""You will not rule Lebanon. ... By God, this is our pledge to you, our pledge to all the martyrs, to all our people and to all the Lebanese."" Hariri said he appreciated those who called for the demonstration ""to defend their democratic rights and beliefs,"" but he said anger should not be expressed by blocking streets, burning tires and violating other people's liberties. ""I want to express my extreme sorrow toward the violence that took place, and I warn everyone not to be dragged in any situation by any suspicious calls for violence,"" Hariri said. ""Don't give anyone the opportunity to use the street as an excuse to express their anger no matter what they do. Don't let anyone intimidate you."" He said that national discourse should prevail over any other discourse and called for citizens ""to put the Lebanese flags on their houses"" and urged them ""to preserve the democratic expression."" ""Today, you are angry, but you are also responsible. I truly understand your feelings. I understand your calls of rage because of your pain and your dignity, but let this anger not lead us to what we don't believe in."" During the day, Suleiman met with parliament over who should be the next prime minister, and Hezbollah said Mikati had secured enough votes to be named to the post. Mikati was the interim prime minister of the Lebanese government that paved the way for the national parliamentary elections after the killing of Rafik Hariri in 2005. The killing sparked widespread anger against Syria, which had troops in Lebanon and immense influence in the government. The national outrage resulted in the resignation in April 2005 of Prime Minister Omar Karame, backed by Syria, and the departure of Syrian troops. Mikati took over the prime minister's post after Karame and served in the position for a few months. Also calling for calm and restraint, Mikati says he would cooperate with all Lebanese parties and extend a hand to all groups to end divisions. In a written statement, he said he sees no reason why all parties should not want to join together. He thanked those who voted for him and said he respected the choice of others. He also said he will visit former prime ministers on Wednesday and has scheduled the consultations with lawmakers to form a new government starting Thursday. Mikati said his nomination is not a challenge to any side or a the victory of one side over the other. He labeled his nomination as a victory of moderation over extremism. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, speaking live on TV, said Hezbollah-nominated Mikati would form ""a national salvation government in which parties from across the political spectrum would take part."" He disputed the view that Mikati is a Hezbollah figure. ""He is a consensus candidate. We will not lead the new government and it will not be the government of Hezbollah,"" Nasrallah said. ""We are going through a very sensitive phase in Lebanon, and we need to work together in order to overcome this phase."" The United States considers Hezbollah, which has close ties to Iran and Syria, to be a terrorist organization. The group is a political party and a major provider of social services in Lebanon, in addition to operating a militant wing. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States is ""watching the situation closely and carefully"" and will judge the new government by its actions. ""As you know, the government formation is just beginning. A Hezbollah-controlled government would clearly have an impact on our bilateral relationship with Lebanon,"" she said. ""Our bottom lines remain as they always have been. First, we believe that justice must be pursued and impunity for murder ended. We believe in Lebanon's sovereignty and an end to outside interference."" U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Lebanon must abide by its constitution and live up to its international obligations. He called for all parties to maintain calm. ""The makeup of Lebanon's government is a Lebanese decision, but this decision should not be reached through coercion, intimidation and threats of violence,"" he said. Crowley stressed the importance of the Special Tribunal and said its work would continue. Martin Nesirky, spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, also urged all to remain calm. He said the ""immediate concern"" should be maintaining ""domestic stability"" and avoiding incidents that ""could easily escalate."" Nasrallah has said he would withhold his views on the Special Tribunal until it announces any decision, a move expected in six to 10 weeks. But he urged Hezbollah's domestic rivals not to use the pending decision ""to serve your political ends."" Under the peace agreement that ended Lebanon's 15-year civil war in 1990, Hezbollah's Iranian-backed militia is the only faction in Lebanon's political system allowed to keep an armed wing. Israel and Hezbollah fought a war in 2006 that devastated southern Lebanon. Clashes between the group and Lebanese authorities in 2008 brought the country to the brink of a new civil war.

"Washington (CNN)Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell is set to be sentenced on Tuesday following his conviction on numerous corruption charges. He faces a sentence that could be up to nearly 13 years in federal prison. So what's a federal prison sentence like after you've endured a high-profile political corruption trial? CNN spoke with Jack Abramoff, the infamous lobbyist who spent more than three years in prison on corruption charges, who shared some words of advice for McDonnell. (This interview was edited for length) Jeremy Diamond, CNN: What's the most important thing for Gov. McDonnell to know as he looks at some serious prison time? Jack Abramoff: His status won't afford him any measure of grandeur over any other prisoner. In fact, it may cause him to have a few moments of discomfort. The prison system is full -- both on the inmate and staff level -- of some people who resent people who have had success in life. To the degree that he is able to keep his head down, get his time served as quietly as possible, that would probably benefit him very much. CNN: What's the main thing that helped you get through your time in prison? Abramoff: First, my family was essential. He's going to have more difficulty from that point, obviously, given what's transpired. My wife visited me every weekend --185 weekends. He won't have, unfortunately, that luxury, but hopefully the rest of his family and friends will be able to visit him frequently. So family, faith. And for me, and I think for many others, a sense of humor. Be able to laugh at least to yourself at the absurdity of what is happening in your life. And also the fact is that no matter what his sentence is, it's unlikely that he's going to end up with a sentence that's going to keep him in prison the rest of his life. There is an exit. When he enters prison -- and it's hard to see it on that day -- but that day is the worst day of the entire process, a process that's been extremely humiliating and horrible and the worst possible life event. But the day you enter is the beginning of the process that ends it for you. CNN: There's a saying that you only serve two days in prison -- the first and the last -- is there any truth to that? (Ed. note: This is from ""The Wire"") Abramoff: No. No. You serve every second in prison. But no matter how bad it is, it could be worse. You could be in a prison where people are getting raped and killed all the time. You could be in a prison in another country being sadistically tortured. There are all sorts of things that could be going on that are worse. CNN: Did you have any misconceptions about prison before you started serving your time? Abramoff: I didn't have a clue. I didn't know anybody who had gone to prison. Nevertheless it was horrific, from minute one to the last minute. You're confined, you have no privacy, there's capricious stealing by the staff and by the inmates. Your property and anything that's of value to you is constantly at risk. Sleep is very difficult in that environment. Getting an hour or two of sleep in a row is often very, very difficult. It's horrible. And of course you have no control over your life. Particularly for somebody who is in the public life, that is particularly bad because the inmates and everybody around you and your family on the outside are hearing all sorts of things and you have no ability to affect the narrative in any way. CNN: What shocked or surprised you when you got to prison? Abramoff: Some of the impressions I had at the beginning, they weren't fully shocking to me, was that upon entry how the other white-collar prisoners (greeted me). The white-collar guys sort of take care of the white-collar guys and the drug guys sort of take care of the drug guys. Somebody new comes into the prison, the other inmates help them get acclimated to the experience. CNN: So you had some people who helped you when you got there? Abramoff: Everybody. Everybody, basically, was extremely helpful. The inmates go out of their way to help somebody acclimate to this new world, which is a nightmare. CNN: So is that the first thing Gov. McDonnell should do if he does go to prison, to find those people who will help him? Abramoff: They'll find him. They'll find him. As soon as he walks onto the compound, they'll come up to him and introduce themselves and try to be helpful. Invariably you have people at the prison who are decent people. Most of the people, frankly, there are decent people who've made mistakes in life and done things that they shouldn't have done, but, frankly, they're decent guys. It's more likely than not that he'll be met with people trying to help and make it less miserable for him if possible and help him settle in. CNN: Do you have some tips for Gov. McDonnell to keep busy and make his time go by faster? Abramoff: Yeah, I mean, basically, stay busy. Prisoners do different things. Some write, some read. Some engage in athletic events and working out and some do all of that. Some get involved in the religious groups that they're part of. Some get involved in hobbies that are permitted in prison. There are plenty of ways to stay busy. The most important thing is to stay busy. One of the dangers for white-collar prisoners is they get in there and they're so stunned by this new world and they reflect on their old world, and it puts them into a depressing mode that sort of leaves them almost catatonic and they don't get going. CNN: Did that happen to you? Abramoff: No, I adjust pretty quickly to wherever I'm at. But I did see it in other people. I remember visibly one guy who was a banker and he came in and he just sat with his head in his hands and I said â€” he had 70 something months ahead of him: 'You're never going to survive this unless you start getting busy.' CNN: Did your political skills help you in prison? Abramoff: This is a place where he is going to interact with human beings 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The ability to be sympathetic to other people's plights, the ability to be empathetic, these are all things that politicians either need to develop or are good at faking. The most important thing in prison is are you a genuine person. Prisoners can quickly pick out who's a phony, who's lying, who's a BS artist. I was in there when somebody who's very high-profile acted like that. And people shunned him. And then you're dealing with not only the people from the outside, but the inside. And that's too much. CNN: Do you think Gov. McDonnell will be watched more? He may be watched more and treated more harshly, as indeed I was for the first year and a half, only from the point of view of certain [correctional officers] wanting to go home to the bar and brag about what they did to the governor, or something like that. CNN: You were saying that largely the other inmates treated you like an equal, but there were some instances when the staff treated you differently? Abramoff: The only way to deal with that is to just keep your head down, be humble, be obedient, follow every rule and just be as courteous and unassuming and unprepossessing as you can. That's the only way around it.","Abramoff on McDonnell: ""When he enters prison ... that day is the worst day of the entire process""
Abramoff said McDonnell needs to get busy fast and stay busy .
Some staff will treat McDonnell differently, Abramoff said. ""He just has to remain resolutely humble and just take it"""
"A Mexican mayor characterized as a ""probable mastermind"" in the mass abduction of 43 students has been taken into custody as authorities have tracked down a top target who eluded them for weeks -- even if they still haven't managed to locate the missing. Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca and his wife, Maria de los Angeles Pineda -- dubbed ""the imperial couple"" by local media for how they presided over their southern Mexican city -- were detained early Tuesday morning at a house they had rented in Mexico City's Iztapalapa neighborhood. They did not resist arrest, authorities said. The couple had been staying in a house that appeared to be abandoned, and investigators first got suspicious when they saw a woman repeatedly entering and leaving the building, Mexican Attorney General Jesús Murillo Karam told reporters. That woman, Noemí Berumen Rodríguez, was arrested alongside the mayor and his wife. Authorities accused her of concealing the couple. Their capture, which Mexican Federal Police spokesman Jose Ramon Salinas reported on his Twitter account, signals a major milestone in the high-profile case. ""I hope that this detention contributes in a decisive way to solving the investigation that the Attorney General's Office is conducting,"" Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto said as he praised authorities for the arrests Tuesday. Yet it's not clear how much closer the arrests get investigators to finding the 43 students, wherever and in whatever state they now are, dead or alive. The victims were mostly men in their 20s studying to become teachers at a college in rural Ayotzinapa. On September 26, they traveled on buses and vans to nearby Iguala for a protest. They haven't been seen or heard from since. Murillo Karam has said that when Abarca, along with Pineda, learned the students' protest would disrupt one of his events, the mayor ordered then-Iguala police Chief Felipe Flores Velasquez to stop the demonstration. Murillo cited information obtained from interrogated police officers and gang members. Police blocked the highway leading into the city and shot at the students' vehicles, killing at least one student. Officers then took the remaining students away and, Murillo said, handed them over to a local criminal gang known as Guerreros Unidos. That gang not only had infiltrated the police department but was also complicit with Abarca, his wife and the now-former police chief, according to the attorney general. Authorities have arrested about 60 suspects, but not the most sought-after ones -- until now. Abarca and Pineda went missing only hours after the students' reported abduction. On October 22, Murillo said his office had issued arrest warrants for them as well as Flores, who remains at large. He said they were considered ""probable masterminds"" of the events in Iguala. The case has spurred protests across Mexico, and the governor of Guerrero state -- criticized for not acting quickly enough after the abductions -- has taken a leave of absence. Rogelio Ortega, the academic tapped to take over for Gov.  Angel Aguirre, told CNN en Español last month that Guerrero state faces a tough road in light of the alleged corruption and kidnappings. ""The problem today is how to successfully face these unleashed demons,"" Ortega said before his selection as interim governor. ""How can we rebuild the social fabric?""

"(CNN) -- Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens, the Republican lawmaker convicted on felony corruption charges in October, officially conceded the Senate race to Democrat Mark Begich on Wednesday. ""Given the number of ballots that remain to be counted, it is apparent the election has been decided and Mayor Begich has been elected,"" Stevens said in a news  release. ""It was a tough fight that would not have been possible without the help of so many Alaskans -- people who I am honored to call my friends. ... I wish Mayor Begich and his family well. My staff and I stand willing to help him prepare for his new position,"" he added. Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin also congratulated Begich on Wednesday. ""I extend my congratulations to Mark Begich and his family. This is a new era for Alaska, and I look forward to working with Mark on the many issues that are important to our state. I am confident he will add a compelling new voice to the U.S. Senate,"" Palin said in a statement. Palin praised Stevens, saying his ""tireless efforts on behalf of the state he loves have benefited all those who call it home."" With 100 percent of Alaska's precincts reporting, Begich, the mayor of Anchorage, had roughly 48 percent of the vote, compared with about 47 percent for Stevens, according to CNN's latest tally. He bested Stevens by 3,724 votes. Alaska Elections Director Gail Fenumiai said that 2,500 overseas ballots remain to be counted. The full results will be certified during the week of December 1. A recount could take place, however, if the vote difference between Begich and Stevens is less than 0.5 percent. Stevens could have also asked for a recount, regardless of the difference, if he pays for it himself. The results of this race have national implications as Democrats seek a filibuster-proof 60-member majority in the Senate. With Begich's win, they hold 58 seats; races in Minnesota and Georgia are still unresolved. Stevens, who turned 85 on Tuesday, was convicted in October of filing false statements on his Senate financial disclosure forms. Prosecutors said Stevens hid hundreds of thousands of dollars in ""freebies"" from an oil-field services company in his home state. On Tuesday, his fellow Senate Republicans postponed a vote on whether to kick Stevens out of their caucus pending the final vote results. Stevens maintained his innocence even after the conviction. At a debate days before the election, he said he had ""not been convicted of anything."" In his statement claiming victory, Begich said he was ""humbled and honored"" by the apparent results. ""It's been an incredible journey getting to this point, and I appreciate the support and commitment of the thousands of Alaskans who have brought us to this day,"" he said in the statement. ""I can't wait to get to work fighting for Alaskan families."" CNN political producer Ed Hornick contributed to this report.","NEW:  ""It is apparent the election has been decided,"" Stevens says .

"'More than a Club.' That's the long-standing motto and image that Barcelona football club has wished upon the world for many years. It is an image the club has carefully cultivated over decades, but could the deal that brought Brazilian star Neymar to the club in June 2013 result in the Spanish giants being known for more than just their football - and not in a good way? For the mood drifting out of Camp Nou, a stadium that has long been revered as a temple of the global game, is one of disarray. Barca, as if anyone needs reminding, is one of world football's most successful clubs on the pitch. Over the last few years it has patented a brand of football that has swept all before it, winning admirers around the world. Off the pitch, the club prides itself on its all-round approach to life, keen to portray its 'open, integrating and caring' side and having refused sponsorship on its shirts for many years because taking money for it sullied the spirit of the game. Perhaps more significantly, Barca has long stood as an emblem for the region of Catalonia - ""a way to show what Catalonia is in the world,"" as Gerard Pique recently told CNN - with Barca widely portrayed as a political spearhead in the bid to fulfill the ideal of independence from Spain. But now Barca finds itself in the dock. Last month, a Spanish judge ordered an inquiry into the Neymar deal after a member of the fan-owned club, Jordi Cases, alleged a misappropriation of funds during the transfer. Cases' primary complaint was that the amount paid to bring Neymar from Brazilian club Santos was more than the reported fee of 57.1 million Euros. In fact, as the club has since admitted, Barca paid 86.2 million Euros for Neymar. One day after the judge agreed to hear the case, Barcelona President Sandro Rosell -- against whom the case was opened -- relinquished his prestigious position despite denying any wrongdoing. He was swiftly replaced by Vice-President Josep Maria Bartomeu, but therein lay another problem. The new man could also become embroiled in a judicial inquiry if Cases chooses to take action against him. ""We brought the case against Rosell but when we saw the contracts, we saw that they had also been signed by Bartomeu,"" Felipe Izquierdo, Cases' lawyer, told CNN World Sport. Izqueirdo says the new president's name is on all but two of the many contracts Barcelona signed to lure Neymar. He added that Vice-President Javier Faus signed the other two, meaning he too could face legal action. Faus had also been in the spotlight for another reason. He was a rare public victim of Lionel Messi's ire when the Barca superstar took umbrage to Faus' comments in December that the club had no obligation to review the Argentine's contract (set to expire in 2018). ""Barcelona is the best club in the world and should be represented by the best board members too,"" the normally mild-mannered Messi exploded. ""Snr Faus is someone who knows nothing about football."" Criticism of Barcelona tends to come from the direction of the Spanish capital, where great rivals Real Madrid are based, and certainly not from within - a warning that all was not well at the home of the four-time European champions. 'No Damage to Brand' More embarrassment came a day after Rosell's resignation as new President Bartomeu held a press conference which outlined that there had, indeed, been a lack of clarity over the total fee paid to bring in Neymar. Nearly 30 million Euros was added to the original figure, including a signing fee for the player, an agreement with Brazilian club Santos concerning academy footballers and a commission to Neymar's father and agent, Neymar Senior, among other measures. With his name on the contract, Bartomeu clearly knew the details but Barcelona say the new man will not be stepping down since he does not believe he has done anything wrong. Faus is insistent that Barca's famous brand has not been dented by the furore. ""Not at all,"" he rallied in a statement to CNN. ""Barcelona is a very lively and democratic club -- owned by its fans -- this is part of the beauty of our institution and we have to respect it. We have not noticed during these weeks any damage to our brand - to the contrary in fact."" ""All our main sponsors have endorsed us and we are advancing with new and exciting deals that we will announce shortly."" Yet Faus' viewpoint directly contradicts the club's own spokesperson, Toni Freixa, when he was trying to get Cases to withdraw his lawsuit against Rosell. ""(Barcelona) regrets not having the information requested (by Snr Cases) earlier, which could have avoided the damage that this affair has caused to the image of the club,"" read a statement by Freixa on the eve of the judge's decision to order an inquiry. It's a sentiment with which blogger Jose Luis Perez wholeheartedly agrees. ""It is clear that this whole incident can greatly damage the image of Barcelona,"" Perez, who has extensively examined the transfer, told CNN. ""Based on previous public cases, I think the judge will pull on a loose thread - meaning that he has received a complaint about one misdemeanor but may end up unraveling more."" ""Lots of things might come out in the coming months."" There is certainly a lot to grapple with. Convoluted Contracts . For a start, the judge has to make sense of all the business personnel connected with Neymar. These include Brazil's richest man, Eike Batista (whose IMX Talent group controls the player's image rights), and one of the country's most famous footballers, Ronaldo, who was on Brazil's victorious 2002 World Cup squad. Ronaldo now has a sports marketing firm, 9ine, which took control of Neymar's commercial rights in 2011 from Wagner Ribeiro, one of Neymar's two agents. The player's other agent, his father, has set up several companies dealing with Neymar's affairs but it's the one he founded in October 2011 - N&N - that is likely to most interest the judge investigating Cases' claims. Having signed an initial agreement with Barcelona in late 2011 over Neymar's potential transfer, N&N received a massive 40 million Euros when the deal went through last year. The total dwarfs the 17.1m Barca paid to Santos for the transfer, so it's no surprise it's come under intense scrutiny. And it's not just the judge poring over the details. Neymar's former club Santos is also unhappy with the revelation and is putting a legal case together to try to obtain full details. The Brazilian club held 55% of Neymar's economic rights but two other companies - DIS (40%) and Teisa (5%) - also believe they have missed out on the windfall. Angered by receiving 40% of just 17.1m Euros rather than 57.1m or even 86.2m Euros, DIS is reported to be considering taking its legal action further - as it ponders a lawsuit against Barcelona, Santos, Neymar Sr and Ribeiro. So is it any surprise, when you consider the complexity of the transfer, that FIFA is so opposed to third-party ownership - where a player is not just owned by a club, but also other parties, in a practice that has become routine in South America? In fact, the game's governing body has the power to investigate the transfer -- with a spokesperson telling CNN this would happen if ""in accordance with the FIFA Disciplinary Code, the Chairman of the FIFA Disciplinary Committee decides ex officio to open investigation."" This remains a mere technical possibility but should it come to pass, such a move could cast another shadow over Barca's reputation. 'Less of a Club'? There are other troubling issues. When Rosell stepped down, he revealed a sinister element as he said his family had suffered threats, with media reports in Spain detailing how his home had been shot at over the Christmas holidays. No one was home at the time. In a different move, the Barca board - once so resistant to bearing a sponsor's name on the team's jerseys - is now considering attaching a sponsor's name to the iconic Camp Nou to fund a proposed 600m Euro redevelopment of the stadium and other facilities. ""We will present a commercial name for the stadium to the Assembly. It will always just be a surname because we will not lose the name Camp Nou,"" Vice-President Faus said on the club's website earlier this month. Barca say stadium title rights could generate 150m Euros for a club that is well over 300m Euros in debt, so one can understand the board's thinking, but it's a controversial move nonetheless. Balancing financial gain with prized ethics can be a challenge, especially when under investigation by a Spanish judge over alleged transfer irregularities. Can it be said that Barcelona is beginning to become 'Less of a Club'?","Barcelona say impending inquiry into Neymar transfer has not damaged club .

"She may be nearly four times as old as its founder, but Florence Detlor likes Facebook. At 101 years old, she's been named by the social network as the oldest of their 900 million registered users. And she also happens to live near Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, a fact that helped her get a personal tour and chance to meet some of the site's leaders.

"Gruesome footage of a toddler falling victim to two successive hit-and-run accidents and then being ignored by many passers-by at the scene last week in southern China continued to galvanize the nation Monday, prompting a fierce debate on the state of morality in Chinese society. A security camera captured the horrific incident last Thursday outside a hardware market in Foshan, Guangdong Province. Two-year-old Wang Yue was seen toddling in the middle of a narrow street and looking around, oblivious to a fast-approaching white van. The disturbing video shows the van knocking the girl over. The driver briefly stops with the girl underneath the van, before continuing on, its rear tires slowly rolling over her small body. The girl is left barely moving in her own blood as several pedestrians and cyclists pass by. Minutes later, another small truck drives over Wang without slowing down, the video shows. More passers-by walked, cycled or drove around her motionless body without stopping -- until a woman carrying a sack appeared 10 minutes after the initial collision. Dropping her sack, she quickly moved the girl to safety and went to look for help. Wang remained in critical condition Monday afternoon in a military hospital in the nearby city of Guangzhou, her father told CNN. ""I'm still so worried,"" said Wang Chichang, who runs a hardware store in the Foshan market, as he waited for updates from doctors. At the time of the accident, Wang was busy tending his shop while his wife was hanging laundry, and neither noticed their daughter had wandered outside, state media reported. ""I feel helpless and angry,"" the father said. ""Had one passer-by stopped to help earlier, this whole thing wouldn't have been so tragic."" Police have caught and detained both drivers, state media reported. Wang, the father, told CNN that the van driver had earlier called to offer the family money, but refused to turn himself in. The heroine in the video turned out to be a 58-year-old scavenger named Chen Xianmei. ""Blood was coming out her nose and mouth,"" Chen told local reporters. ""I didn't understand why no one else had carried her from the street."" In emotional video posted online, the girl's wailing mother bows on her hands and knees, her forehead resting on the ground at Chen's feet -- a symbol of extreme deference to show the family's deep gratitude for her daughter's rescuer. The mother is inconsolable as loved ones lead her -- her body as limp as a rag doll's -- from the scene. The grainy footage of the accidents went viral on Chinese Internet within minutes of posting. By Monday afternoon, it had become the most viewed topic on Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, with more than 4 million tweets discussing the video. ""This kind of news sends chills down my spine every time,"" a user named ""the silent wolverine"" wrote. ""We once believed in a world filled with love and were taught by the government on maintaining high moral standards -- but the cold reality just keeps flying in the face of our belief."" Echoing such sentiment, Wang's father said her tragedy is more than just personal. ""If our society continues to be like this, my child's case won't be the last one,"" he said. While netizens directed their anger on the indifferent passers-by and lamented vanishing morality in society, many also see a glimmer of hope through Chen's action. ""The scavenger probably never imagined she was actually 'richer' than many of us,"" user ""Van-stephen"" commented on Weibo. ""She follows her conscience, which many of us have already lost."" In recent years, assisting victims in traffic accidents or other emergency situations has become controversial in China. In an attempt to cover costly medical expenses, several senior citizens, injured in accidents that were their own fault, turned against people who helped them at the scene by suing the good Samaritans for compensation, according to state media. Despite the potential trouble and some criticism that she was seeking fame, Chen appeared unfazed. ""I didn't think of anything at the time,"" she told local reporters. ""I just wanted to save the girl.""","The toddler was the victim of two successive hit-and-run accidents .

"Russian President Vladimir Putin has been known to play with tigers and ride horseback shirtless. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev apparently prefers pachyderms. In between diplomatic meetings at the ASEAN summit that is underway in the capital of Myanmar, Medvedev visited one of this country's biggest attractions -- the white elephants kept in pens next to the giant golden pagoda in Naypyitaw. Medvedev had his shirt on, a Hawaiian shirt in fact, as he and a small entourage fed snacks to the elephants as his motorcade was parked just outside the Uppatasanti Pagoda. Obama in Myanmar: Rohingya crisis could dim ASEAN . My producer and I happened to be visiting the same pagoda at just the right time.  Alerted to Medvedev's presence by the Russian flags mounted on a fleet of black stretch limos, we quickly seized the opportunity to see a Russian leader out in the wild. There was one small problem. We happened to be barefoot as it is customary to remove your shoes before entering a temple. With no time or shoe leather to spare, we scampered down the pagoda's steps and caught up with the prime minister. On the other side of the world, Obama determined as ever to bypass Congress . Medvedev was on his way to his limo as I shouted a few questions. CNN: ""What do you think of the elephants?"" Medvedev: ""Excellent.  Magical.  Super."" CNN: ""Do you think the U.S. and Russia can come to an agreement on what's happening in Ukraine right now?"" Medvedev:  ""Time will show."" The Russian Prime Minister returned to his motorcade. I put my shoes back on. As it turns out, Medvedev and President Barack Obama spoke briefly about the crisis in Ukraine on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit.  Following their encounter, the Russian news agency Interfax quoted Medvedev as saying he and Obama did not resolve their nations' differences over Ukraine. ""Naturally, we discuss such nuances, but, obviously, it is not the kind of format that could allow us to resolve all existing problems,"" Medvedev said. Secret talks, long dinner led to historic climate agreement . The U.S. must ""stop resorting to sanctions and return to normal, calm and productive talks"" the Russian Prime Minister added. Two years ago, Obama infamously told Medvedev in a ""hot mic"" moment that he would have more ""flexibility"" in his dealings with Putin after the 2012 presidential election. ""I will transmit this information to Vladimir,"" replied Medvedev, who was Russia's president at the time. Instead of feeding information back to Moscow, Medvedev on this day had the ears of a few grateful and rather hungry white elephants.

"On paper, the 1974 version of ""The Great Gatsby"" had everything. It starred Robert Redford, the biggest, most glamorous movie star of the era. The screenplay was by Francis Ford Coppola, coming off writing Oscars for ""The Godfather"" and ""Patton."" The art direction was sumptuous, and the costumes -- which helped launch a new craze for 1920s-inspired fashion -- were designed by the then little-known Ralph Lauren, among others. And yet the movie, though a box-office success, fell far short of the novel. Critics at the time roasted it, and it's been largely forgotten since its release. There are lots of reasons that the 1974 ""Gatsby"" hasn't become a film classic equal to the book's literary status. The actors were, perhaps, miscast: Redford a little too perfect given Gatsby's rough edges, Bruce Dern too unpolished for rich Yalie Tom Buchanan. Director Jack Clayton may have paid more attention to the opulent settings than the relationships between the characters. And then there's the shadow of Fitzgerald himself, with his lyrical language, so enticing on the page and so difficult to translate onto celluloid. But Hollywood hasn't given up. Like the green light across the bay that forever taunts the book's title character, F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic 1925 novel holds out the promise of a dream: turning the Great American Novel into the Great American Movie. After all, it has everything -- a love story, sex, money, crime, great themes, lush settings. The latest attempt, a 3-D version starring Leonardo DiCaprio and directed by ""Moulin Rouge's"" Baz Luhrmann, opens Friday. Luhrmann has steeped himself in both Fitzgerald and the Jazz Age. He immersed himself in Fitzgerald's biography. He read previous drafts of the novel. He even has a reason for using rock and hip-hop music on his soundtrack: The seemingly anachronistic sounds are the equivalent of jazz in the novel's 1922 setting, when the music was ""referred to as an African-American fad,"" the director told The New York Times. But does it matter? Is ""Gatsby,"" finally, that dreaded word in Hollywood -- ""unfilmable""? ""The language in 'Gatsby' is almost like poetry,"" says Louis Giannetti, emeritus film professor at Case Western Reserve University. ""How do you translate that into cinematic terms?"" Entertainment vs. high school . It's never easy. Novels and motion pictures are distinct forms of storytelling, points out Everest Entertainment's Tom Heller, who helped produce the films ""Precious,"" ""127 Hours"" and the current ""Mud."" A book takes place largely in the reader's imagination; a movie makes concrete choices, down to the casting. Moreover, it can be tough for a film to translate the internal thoughts of characters and narrators into action -- turning subtext into text, in other words. Len Cassuto, an English professor at Fordham University, says he admires the film version of ""The Remains of the Day"" for taking Anthony Hopkins' passive butler and turning him into a fascinating film character. ""The (actors) could bring that inner turmoil into sight nonverbally,"" he says. ""It's a pretty big risk to write that as a movie."" Still, says Heller, any literary work can be made into a film, given the right hands. If there's a risk, he observes, it's when filmmakers adhere too closely to a classic or popular book, resulting in an airless dramatization -- not a full-bodied film. ""There's a danger that it can be perceived as something that's good for you,"" he says. ""Films work best when they're extremely entertaining. An audience might look at a film that's adapted from a novel and think that they're in a high school class."" Indeed, it's a Hollywood truism that some of the best movies are made from energetic potboilers. ""The Godfather"" is usually Exhibit A: a fine, pulpy novel turned into a great film thanks to Coppola's attention to theme, photography and character. Nevertheless, certain producers have been particularly eager to snap up prestigious literary properties and worry about the cinematic issues later. Scott Rudin, in particular, is well-known for his literary tastes, having optioned Cormac McCarthy's ""No Country for Old Men,"" Michael Chabon's ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay,"" Jonathan Safran Foer's ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" and Jonathan Franzen's ""Freedom"" over the years. Not all of them have worked out, however. How to throw a 1920s party worthy of Gatsby himself . Adapting to challenges . Indeed, it's not just literary pedigree that may make a book ""unfilmable."" Moviemakers may be wary of subject matter, technological challenges, even the mood. A talked-about book might only sell 50,000 copies; a movie has to sell millions of tickets. So there's a reason Hollywood took the tragic ending of ""The Natural"" and turned it into a scene of feel-good fireworks. Who, besides a bunch of hubris-fascinated English majors, wants to see the book's (spoiler!) fallen, weeping Roy Hobbs ""excluded from the game and all his records forever destroyed""? Those challenges need not be a death sentence at the box office or with critics, however. ""The Natural"" had a successful run. John Ford's version of ""The Grapes of Wrath"" eliminated a symbolic suckling scene, toned down the politics, changed the ending and became a classic. McCarthy's brutal ""No Country for Old Men"" is full of horrific violence (not to mention the author's distinctive terse writing). Yet the Coen brothers managed to make an Oscar winner out of the material, helped in no small way by Javier Bardem's chilling performance as Anton Chigurh. ""Midnight Cowboy,"" ""The English Patient,"" ""The Lord of the Rings,"" ""Life of Pi"" -- all had their issues, whether cultural, literary or technological, and all ended up successful and award-winning films. The key is that everybody has to be on the same page (pardon the pun), says screenwriter Karol Hoeffner, who's adapted works by authors such as Danielle Steel . ""For the best adaptations, you have a partnership,"" says Hoeffner, who teaches at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. Moviemaking is a team effort, and if the screenwriter, director and producer are at loggerheads, the final product will suffer, she says. And you have to follow your own muse, she adds. Hoeffner's original work, including books for young adults, is far different from Steel's romances, and she knew she'd have to make Steel's melodramatic dialogue more film-friendly. ""But,"" she says, ""I was convinced I could tell the story."" Marketing muscle . Which brings us back to ""Gatsby."" Luhrmann has the creative partnerships: Pal Craig Pearce wrote the screenplay and Luhrmann's wife, Catherine Martin, tackled the production design. He's tried a different angle, getting at ""Gatsby's"" famous distance by making Nick Carraway's character -- now in a sanitarium -- the novelist. And, not unimportantly, he has the marketing muscle. After all, a primary reason Hollywood keeps adapting certain novels is the built-in sales factor. ""Gatsby"" is on countless high school reading lists and sells hundreds of thousands of copies a year. There's a curious audience already waiting. In addition, the book is being backed by a marketing blitz that would make Fitzgerald, a former advertising man, proud. Brooks Brothers, Tiffany, hotels, even an ice-cream manufacturer have climbed aboard the ""Gatsby"" bandwagon. Will all that appeal to a summer movie audience generally filled with teenagers? It's certainly shrewd, says Mary Simonson, a film and media studies professor at Colgate University. ""As I watched the trailer, I thought, 'This is for 16-year-olds,' "" she says. ""All of this is about gearing this toward high school and college students who may not have any notion of who Fitzgerald was or what the book actually was. ""They're not going to care too much about whether this is a well-done adaptation,"" she adds. ""They're going to care about whether it's a Hollywood blockbuster.""","New version of ""The Great Gatsby"" one of many attempts to bring classic to the screen .

"Firebrand Sen. Elizabeth Warren joined Senate Democratic leadership Thursday after Senate Democrats convened Thursday to assemble a leadership team for their role as the incoming minority caucus. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who was elected to continue leading the Democratic caucus in the minority, said he tapped Warren to join Thursday because of who she is. ""I expect her to be Elizabeth Warren,"" Reid said explaining what he expects the Massachusetts senator to do as part of the leadership team. Warren, known for hitting populist notes in stump speeches, said she was excited to join the Democratic leadership to continue fighting for the middle class. ""Wall Street is doing very well, CEOs are bringing in millions more and families all across this country are struggling,"" she said. ""We have to make this government work for the American people."" And flanked by Warren and the two other women who are joining his leadership team (Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Debbie Stabenow), Reid said women in the Senate have brought positive change to the legislative body. ""I've seen this institution change for a lot of reasons,"" Reid, who has been in Congress for three decades, said. ""One reason it has changed for good is because of women. Women think differently than men."" Reid also insisted that Democrats would stray from replicating what he described as an obstructionist Republican minority once his party loses the gavel. ""This is not get-even time,"" Reid said. ""I do not intend to run the Democratic caucus like the Republican caucus has been run in the minority."" A Senate Democratic leadership aide said earlier that Reid would like Warren to join the leadership because he ""trusts her and her judgment."" And while not every Senate Democrat wants Warren, a high-profile, liberal junior senator in a leadership post, the leadership aide said ""Reid will get his way."" Sen. Jon Tester of Montana also joined the leadership team and will head the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee as Democrats look to reclaim the majority in 2016. One Democratic senator, Chris Murphy of Connecticut, said the inclusion of Warren is a sign the party mistakenly moved away from core Democratic stances -- such as defending Obamacare on the campaign trail -- and needs to be more focused on middle class issues like raising the minimum wage. ""There's nobody better than Elizabeth at talking to people who feel this sense of very real economic disenchantment,"" Murphy said. Despite the mid-term election losses, Reid and the other top members of the Democratic leadership were all re-elected, although two centrist members of the caucus voted against Reid. ""When you have an election like this, common sense says we need to change things,"" said Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri.  ""The voice was very loud and unmistakable that most Americans, and most Missourians, want us to change things.  To me that means changing leadership and it was just that simple."" Sen. Joe Manchin said the Democrats' problems are deep rooted and change is needed. ""I voted for a change and that change was not voting for this leadership,"" Manchin told reporters. The top GOP leaders were all re-elected: Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky will become majority leader, flanked by Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming and Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri. Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi beat out Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada to lead the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

"There is no doubt that in our interconnected world, the G20 has a critical role to play in driving inclusive growth, creating jobs and increasing global living standards. As a long-time advocate for reducing inequality -- or to put it another way, upping the fairness factor in local and global economies alike -- I am heartened to hear world leaders and policy-makers increasingly agree that growing inequality is undesirable. But while we all agree that the world is facing an unprecedented number of large-scale, complex economic challenges, there remains heated discussion about the policy fixes needed. The diagnoses of the world's ills are increasingly in alignment -- even News Corp chief executive Rupert Murdoch recently expressed concern about rising inequality -- but the suggested cures are fiercely contested. Wealth gap increasingly 'obscene' As economist Thomas Piketty so eloquently argued this year, wealth and the return on capital are growing faster than the overall economy and income from labor.  Making matters worse, labor income is becoming increasingly skewed, with an ever increasing share going to a small band of top earners. This means we are approaching levels of inequality in wealth and income that are increasingly difficult to justify, increasingly obscene, and are an increasing drag on productivity and growth. Inequality of this magnitude undermines the basic notions of trust, fairness, and social cohesion that underpin our economies and societies. That's why civil society wants G20 nations to embed equity in their country growth plans by measuring improvements in the incomes of the bottom 20% of households. The G20's commitment to pursuing economic growth of two percentage points above current targets over the next five years is welcome. But the success of the Brisbane talks must also be viewed through the lens of fairness. Leaders must be held to account for ensuring the benefits of growth are spread more widely. G20 needs to change . Just as the G20 has evolved in recent years from a gathering of finance ministers to include national leaders, the involvement of non-government organizations in G20 meetings and decision-making is a reflection of the realities of contemporary governing and policy making. Put simply: the continuing relevance and legitimacy of the G20 as an effective global economic policy-making body is reliant on it being more people-focused. That means the realization among global policy agenda-setters that inequality and exclusion stifles economic growth must drive better responses to addressing the economic impact of climate change, for example, and the establishment of robust post-2015 sustainable development goals. The way forward . The Australian presidency has no less a task than securing the G20's future. The jury is still out on whether its outreach to non-government actors and, importantly, to developing nations is enough to deliver this. Consider the key agenda item of driving jobs growth. Governments must work with the corporate sector and the community as equal partners to provide real and quality jobs in the formal sector of the economy, with social and legal protections so that all workers, especially those from vulnerable groups, have the opportunity for improved participation. The G20 is also poised to make genuine progress on glaring faults in global governance, via its tax reform and transparency agenda. The potential benefits of coordinated action to increase transparency range from strengthening efforts to combat corruption and money laundering, to finally countering tax evasion and avoidance. It's time to end tax havens and secrecy jurisdictions, and the practices that allow earnings to be ""washed"" or hidden, as well as the lax residency standards and treaty shopping that allow profit shifting. Aggressive tax planning alone is estimated to cost developing nations billions of dollars a year. These are the same countries which rely heavily on foreign aid and lack the resources to deal with poverty or fund essential health care and education services. As governments of wealthy and developing nations alike decry their ability to ""afford"" to meet the growing demands placed on them by their citizens, they surely have no excuse to ignore the policy levers they have at their disposal to plug leaky and opaque tax systems. Is it too much to ask that adequate health services, better education opportunities and even clean water no longer remain hostage to capricious and shady global tax arrangements? I'd say it's only fair for the G20 to act.","G20 leaders are meeting in Brisbane to agree ways to boost global growth .

"(CNN) -- An alleged letter from President Barack Obama to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has prompted consternation not just in Washington, but also Tel Aviv and Riyadh. According to the Wall Street Journal, Obama pointed out some common American and Iranian interests in defeating the extremist ISIS -- which calls itself the Islamic State -- and reportedly also suggested that a nuclear accord between Iran and the P5+1 (United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia, China and Germany) could result in cooperation on regional issues between Washington and Tehran. But the move has, according to one Republican source quoted by CNN, sent ""shock waves"" through Washington. Why? The alleged letter comes despite a consistent message from the White House and America's top nuclear negotiators that nuclear talks would not be linked to larger regional issues on which Iran may possess greater leverage. And while it is not surprising the letter has upset domestic critics of the negotiations, the alleged correspondence has also unsettled Israel and Saudi Arabia, which fear a ""bad"" deal with Iran and even secret collusion between Washington and Tehran. But such concerns seem unfounded. For a start, Washington has plenty of leverage to negotiate a good deal with Iran that constrains its nuclear program. Just as important, though, is that the United States has an opportunity not only to resolve the nuclear issue, but also to defuse tensions with Iran while maintaining America's bonds with its traditional partners. The reality is that the nuclear negotiations between Iran and the United States are not the result of a newfound friendship. Instead, the international sanctions regime against Iran has given it an incentive to compromise on its nuclear program. And although the election of Hassan Rouhani as president has also helped, it's not clear that Rouhani's presidency without sanctions pressure would have gotten the negotiations as far as they have come. Of course, even after a deal, Washington and Tehran will face real differences over their respective policies in the Middle East; a return of the kind of U.S.-Iran alliance that was seen under the former Shah is highly unlikely. Yet the United States doesn't have to like or agree with the Iranian regime's policies in order to have some sort of relationship with it. After all, despite increasing tensions on a range of issues, Washington still maintains diplomatic ties to Moscow and Beijing. And while Iran is not a great power, it does play a major role in nearly all the conflicts roiling the Middle East, contributing to instability in the region. So, can the United States provide enough inducements for Iran to change its ways in the region? Perhaps. Although Iran has given the world plenty of reason to believe that it will simply go about its business as usual after a possible nuclear deal, it seems more likely that the combination of a deal, Rouhani's presidency, and public demand in Iran for real change would offer Washington an opportunity to exact real changes from the regime. Such optimism might not be shared by Iran's regional neighbors -- especially Israel and Saudi Arabia. Israeli officials especially these days tend to portray the Iranian regime in the starkest terms possible. But both countries will sooner or later have to accept that Iran as a country is not going to go anywhere, and so crafting policies that encourage its evolution into a more open, tolerant and cooperative country is in the long-term interests not just of the United States, but the Middle East as well. True, there are no guarantees that such an Iran will ever emerge. The government exercises tight control over the country, and in many ways Rouhani, while more pragmatic than other clerics, is still not as open and reform-minded as the West would like. Yet anyone who visits Iran these days will surely see a country that is very different from the images that have been etched into the American psyche. Scenes like the burning of U.S. flags do occur. But Iran is much bigger and more complex than the black-and-white presentations of it by much of the media. CNN host Anthony Bourdain's recent culinary trip in ""Parts Unknown"" was a great example of this. Communicating with one's adversaries isn't a sign of weakness; in order to compel certain behavior, one has to communicate what that desired behavior is. But even if Iran does not accept a compromise by the November 24 deadline for the talks, America will still have greater leverage over Tehran than it has ever had, and will be able to portray Iran as the intransigent party to the international community. All this suggests that the United States has a real opportunity not only to put the brakes on Iran's nuclear pursuits, but also to bolster larger American goals. And the problem lies not in Obama's letter to Khamenei, but the fearful reaction it has produced; it is time to take a deep breath and consider the success that has been achieved so far in bringing Iran to the table on the nuclear issue. Khamenei might claim the letter is a sign of strength to his followers. But in reality he has been pushed into a corner.","Alleged Obama letter to Iran's Supreme Leader sparks controversy .

"(CNN) -- Social media is revamping the way businesses reach their audiences, transforming boring billboards and cold commercials into a land of interactive wonders. Here we collect some of the best new examples of companies using advertising to get social with customers, including coffee company Douwe Egbert, which created a yawn-activated drink dispenser in a Johannesburg airport using facial recognition technology, and the frozen food firm Birds Eye, which created a pop-up called The Picture House in three British cities to allow diners to eat for free in exchange for sharing a snap on Instagram. And on London's busy Oxford Street, people who walk past the bus stops don't realize they're a step away from a free snack at one of the special vending machines there. The dispensers are run by Walkers, which is known as Lays in the US and Chipsy in Egypt. Anyone who passes the machines can send a message to Walkers on Twitter and out pops a free bag of a new line of potato chips chosen by the public.

"Can we really say that the crisis in Ukraine is as important as meeting the challenge of ISIS, also known as the Islamic State, or Ebola, or the South China Sea? An initial answer would be that our shifting attention is part of the problem, which Russia has consistently exploited to get what it wants. Russia maximized its deliveries of men and arms to East Ukraine in August and September to coincide with one peak of the crisis in Iraq. Appeals by the likes of former Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov that ""considering the surrounding threats, we have to find a way out of the Ukrainian mess as soon as possible"" are unfortunately attractive to some, but are an invitation to ignore our own true interests. The NATO summit in Wales in September didn't seem to think Ukraine was that important. It produced something resembling a plan for ISIS, and some palliatives for the next possible crisis in Eastern Europe by beefing up security in Poland and the Baltic States. But it did little to help Ukraine now. Ukrainian President Poroshenko's speech to Congress in September was interrupted by applause 40 times, but his barbed remark that Ukraine ""cannot win a war with blankets"" only produced $53 million in non-lethal aid. ISIS is of course hugely important. The humanitarian crisis in Syria and Iraq involves over 10 million refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs). The threat of jihadis returning home, especially to the likes of the UK, is rightly of paramount concern. So is the issue of why so many left the UK to fight in the first place. There is also a sense of responsibility for what happened after 2003 or 1991. But, apart from the issue of militant recruitment and terrorist blowback within Europe, this is not an issue about Europe's neighborhood. Ukraine, on the other hand, is both the literal and metaphorical frontier of Europe. And Russia's entire modus operandi, of which its current actions in Ukraine are only the most visible part, is not only a challenge to the European order, but a challenge that is dangerously exploiting the many existing problems within the EU. So, here is a list of reasons to be concerned. Russia hasn't finished, even in Ukraine. The territories its proxies control in the Donbas make no historical or economic sense. Crimea is isolated. Russia also wants Ukraine to fail. The story that began with the Uprising in Kiev in February was about changing Ukraine for the better. Then it became about Ukraine's very survival as a state. Ukrainian voters in the October elections showed a strong desire to get back to the original story. But Russia clearly does not want that to happen. And if Ukraine does fail to transform itself, it will be only one in a string of dysfunctional states ringing the EU. All of Russia's neighbors, friend and foe, are worried. Russia has been creating an alternative media space in the Baltic States for years. It is blatantly interfering in Moldova's upcoming election. States like Kazakhstan with aging leaders and Russian minorities worry that succession crises might be turned into secession crises. Azerbaijan has used the crisis as cover to launch a political crack-down; saber-rattling with neighboring Armenia almost led to war in August. Russia and Ukraine are locked together in a spiral of economic decline. Ukrainian GDP is forecast to fall by 10% this year. Ukraine also has a humanitarian crisis; the official estimate for IDPs by the UNHCR was already 445,000 by 10 November. The Russian economy was already flat-lining even before the oil price started heading south. EU states like Germany are finally also feeling the cost of sanctions, with unfortunate timing as the Eurozone again stagnates. None of the scenarios look good: if Putin rides out the pain and the Russian economy really crashes; if the pain leads to internal crisis in Russia; or if EU soft-liners water down sanctions before they have their full effect. Russia will be an easy target for a rhetorical hard-line as the USA gears up for the 2016 elections, as direct American business interests in Russia are few. What happens in Ukraine is also crucial for what happens beyond Ukraine. Russia has been causing problems within the EU for years. Projects like South Stream are more important for the corruption they channel into Europe than the energy they might deliver. Russia is actually keen on Serbia joining the EU, in order to have another client state on the inside. Russia did not create anti-EU parties of the left and right, or nationalist movements against EU nation-states, or the post-modern cynicism common among European youth. But its propaganda channels and internet trolls ""nudge"" them all. Russia Today's motto is ""question more"" -- not believe everything we say about Russia. Its modus operandi is to spread doubt, cynicism and conspiracy-theory in the West. Specific propaganda messages about Russia or Ukraine are then buried in the post-modern melange. And there is a very difficult winter ahead. If sanctions stay at the current level, Russia will really feel the pain in six months. But Ukraine has to get there first, with the risk of further crises and renewed conflict very real.","Russia hasn't finished, even in Ukraine, writes Andrew Wilson .

"With their distinctive, colorful headwear, Lisu women stand out from the lush green fields of northern Thailand. Where once opium was grown, cash crops like rice and corn are now harvested, providing a simple way of life for members of one of Thailand's most remote tribal groups. Around 50,000 members of the Lisu tribe live in Thailand, many in isolated village communities  near the border with Laos and Myanmar. Descendants of semi-nomadic, ethnic Tibetan tribes, their traditions, culture and animistic beliefs remain a strong part of their lives. ""We have a simple happy life,"" explains the youthful-looking head of the village of Ban Man Pa. During torrential rain it's easy to imagine how hard life can be for villagers as dirt roads become muddy streams and people shelter in simple wooden buildings. Yet most seem content, even if they could do with electricity. But they don't live completely without the conveniences of modern life, says the village head. Once his family used to own Thai horses, but now they have Japanese ones he jokes. ""They're called Toyota.""","Many Lisu people live in remote villages in northern Thailand .

"Bombs exploded near two shuttered embassies in Tripoli Thursday morning, according to state media and eyewitness accounts. Libyan state media, citing witnesses, said a car bomb exploded near the Egyptian embassy in central Tripoli. The second blast occurred near the embassy of the United Arab Emirates in the western part of the capital, according to residents. No injuries were reported in either blast, but photos posted to social media appeared to show extensive damage around both buildings. A resident who lives near the UAE embassy said in a social media posting that the blast shattered some windows in nearby buildings. The explosions come a day after bombings killed at least five and wounded more than a dozen in two eastern Libyan cities that are strongholds for Libya's anti-Islamist government. Most embassies in Libya have closed due to the ongoing fighting there between Islamists and the internationally recognized government more than three years after rebels -- backed by NATO aircraft -- toppled the regime of Moammar Gadhafi. In August, U.S. Pentagon and State Department officials said they believed Egypt and the UAE had been carrying out secret airstrikes against Islamist militants. Egyptian officials have denied any involvement in Libyan airstrikes.","Bombs explode near Egyptian, UAE embassies in Tripoli, media and witnesses say .

"It may be a foregone conclusion in the minds of many that accused Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is guilty of murder.  A horrific crime: multiple killings, including that of a child, and more than 200 maimed or wounded. What may be less clear is Tsarnaev's role in the attack, and whether, if convicted, he will be sentenced to death. As both sides prepare for his November trial, court filings and arguments by prosecutors and the defense provide a glimpse into their opposing strategy for the penalty phase of the case. The government says it has video showing Tsarnaev placing a backpack near the finish line, then using his cell phone, moments before the first bomb went off. He walked away and the second bomb went off in front of the camera, officials say. There is also the note Tsarnaev scribbled on the boat he was hiding in, claiming the Boston Marathon victims were payback for U.S. wars in Muslim lands. Excerpts of the note open the grand jury indictment.  ""I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished;"" Tsarnaev wrote.  ""We Muslims are one body, you hurt one, you hurt us all;"" ""Now I don't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in Islam but due to said (unintelligible) it is allowed;"" and ""Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop."" In seeking the death penalty, prosecutors cite as an aggravating factor Tsarnaev's ""betrayal of the United States.""  They claim that after Tsarnaev received asylum from the United States, the defendant ""enjoyed the freedoms of a United States citizen; and then betrayed his allegiance to the United States"" by killing and maiming its people. Leading the defense team is Judy Clarke, a longtime public defender who has represented some of the nation's most notorious criminals, including ""Unabomber"" Ted Kaczynski, who killed three; Jared Loughner, who shot and killed six people and critically wounded Rep. Gabby Giffords; and Susan Smith, the emotionally disturbed mother who drowned her two children. Kaczynski and Loughner pleaded guilty and were sentenced to life imprisonment. In the Smith case, Clarke argued that her client's abusive childhood and depression tormented her, causing her to ""snap.""  Although it convicted Smith of murdering her sons, the jury spared her life. ""She enjoys a wonderful reputation, she fights very hard for all her clients,"" said former U.S. attorney David Kelley, who prosecuted terrorism cases in New York's Southern District.  ""She's the model for all defense lawyers."" Humanizing Tsarnaev is a priority for his defense team, said David Hoose, a criminal defense lawyer who represented Kristen Gilbert, a former Veterans Administration nurse convicted of killing four patients.  The jury in that case did not vote unanimously to impose the death sentence.  Gilbert was thus sentenced to life in prison. ""There's always a story to be told, "" Hoose said.  ""It's not a story that excuses or justifies what was done. but it explains and allows us to understand as human being to human being what led someone to the point in their life where they could undertake such an act that virtually everyone else finds incomprehensibly horrible."" The defense has great leeway in presenting its case for the penalty phase.  ""The Supreme Court has held that pretty much anything related to the defense background, or character, or to the circumstances surrounding the crime"" is admissible, Hoose said. Hoose said he believes Tsarnaev, who was 19 when the crime happened, has a good chance of avoiding the death penalty. ""This is a young kid, still impressionable, only a year and a half over the minimum that he would have to be even to be eligible for the death penalty, who is clearly under the influence of an older brother who has been radicalized and who has become extremely violent.  What do you do as a younger sibling when that kind of thing is going on in your family?"" In a recent court filing, the defense lawyers sought information prosecutors obtained from the federal government's surveillance of Tamerlan Tsarnaev.  ""Any evidence tending to show that Tamerlan supplied the motivation, planning and ideology behind the Boston Marathon attack, and that his younger brother acted under his domination and control, is material,"" the defense argued. Tsarnaev's defense team declined to comment to CNN, but in a status hearing this week, they called the Tsarnaev family dynamic key to their case.  ""If the government indictment is true, this is about a family,"" defense attorney David Bruck said.  The defense objects to having an FBI agent monitor conversations between Tsarnaev and his siblings during prison visits.  Judge George O'Toole has indicated he agrees with the defense, but deferred ruling to give prosecutors time to respond. Since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988, three people have been executed: Timothy McVeigh, for the Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people; Juan Garza, for three murders connected to drug trafficking; and Louis Jones, for the kidnapping and murder of a female soldier. According to the Federal Death Penalty Resource Counsel Project, juries have handed down 74 death sentence verdicts since the death penalty was reinstated.  However, a judge has formally applied the sentence only 71 times.  The disparity comes from defendants' convictions that were overturned or death verdicts that were vacated before formal sentencing by the judge. The liberal-leaning nature of Boston-area juries also will bear watching in Tsarnaev's case.  Massachusetts banned the death penalty in 1984.   Hoose said in an area that is heavily Catholic, many are inclined to follow the lead of Pope Francis, who opposes capital punishment. In a Boston Globe poll taken in September, 57% of Boston respondents supported a life sentence for Tsarnaev.  Thirty-three percent favored the death penalty. Lillian Campbell, whose granddaughter, Krystle Campbell, was killed in the marathon bombings, told CNN's Chris Cuomo, ""When they came out with this part about the death sentence ... I said, well, I don't really care what they do with them.  Because whatever they do, it's not going to bring her back,"" she said. ""I'll never forget her, ever, no matter how much they say.  Or what they do with the guy who did it. So I wouldn't wish anyone dead.  I wouldn't.""  ""Even after what he did?"" asked Cuomo. ""Even after what he did,"" Campbell replied. Prosecutors in the case declined to speak with CNN. Former federal prosecutor Allison Burroughs said, given the nature of the crime, it's not surprising the government is seeking the death penalty.  ""If not in this case, then when?"" Burroughs said. However, she said winning a death penalty verdict in Massachusetts is so unlikely it may not be worth the time and resources involved. Others say the government made the right decision. ""The death penalty attaching to a case of terrorism where people are maimed and killed is certainly a reasonable option,"" said Gerry Leone, the former Middlesex County District Attorney who prosecuted ""shoe-bomber"" Richard Reid in 2002.  Reid pleaded guilty before going to trial. Although Leone said he thinks the defense has a chance of beating the death penalty, the prosecution strategy should be clear. ""The prosecution keeps harping on and keeps drilling home the facts. And the facts are horrible here.  Two-hundred-sixty plus people who were hurt and maimed.  Three people dead.  A police officer in the aftermath of those actions executed,"" Leone said.  ""The government will keep pounding home the facts in this case, which are just horrible from a human perspective."" Richard Burr, who represented Timothy McVeigh, knows what it is like to lose a capital case.  McVeigh was executed in 2001. ""In any case where there is huge public injury, there's pressure on political leaders to seek the death penalty. There may be pressure on jurors to return a death penalty, even against their better wisdom."" The key, Burr said, is to present the jurors with a detailed narrative of the defendant's life that can evoke some mercy.  ""Clarke and her team are masters at getting at a defendant's life story,"" Burr said.  Yet ""she is also attuned to the critical need for the capital defense team not to ignore the victims."" ""The death penalty deprives people of their humanity,"" Burr added.  ""We have to try to help remind everybody that we're all in this together.""","Tsarnaev is accused of killing three in Boston Marathon bombing .

"Checking off the world's most important natural and cultural wonders can be a herculean task. The World Heritage List -- that most lauded and recognizable of preservation lists -- includes nearly 1,000 sites all over the world. That number will almost certainly increase when the World Heritage Committee of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization meets June 15-25 in Qatar. Instead of sorting through that encyclopedic list, why not start at the very beginning with the first 12 sites? The Galapagos Islands in Ecuador, Yellowstone National Park in the United States and the Island of Goree in Senegal were among the 12 sites named to the first list in 1978. Only countries that sign the convention creating the World Heritage Committee and list can nominate sites, and that was just 40 countries when the first nominations came out. Thirty-six years later, 191 nations have signed the convention. ""There is an incredible diversity of sites both natural and cultural around the world,"" said Mechtild Rossler, deputy director of UNESCO's World Heritage Centre, a 22-year veteran of the organization. ""The beauty of this convention is that the text defining natural and cultural heritage is very broad."" Being named to the list is a big deal. Government officials work for years to prepare their nominations, and preservation officials hope for those designations to support their work. And what tourist site doesn't tout its World Heritage Site designation? While we wait to learn the newest members of this prestigious list, here are the first 12 World Heritage sites, listed in the order in which they are listed in the minutes of the September 1978 meeting in Washington. L'Anse aux Meadows National Historic Park, Canada . What's left of the 11th-century Viking settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows National Historic Park on the island of Newfoundland in Canada is the earliest evidence of the first European presence in North America. Excavations have found timber-framed, peat-turf buildings like those found in Iceland and Norse Greenland during the same period. It's the first and only known Viking site in North America. The site was protected by the government of Canada in 1977,  just a year before its inclusion on the World Heritage List. Nahanni National Park, Canada . Located in Canada's Northwest Territories along the South Nahanni River and the Flat River, Nahanni National Park was protected as a national park by Canada in 1972. Nahanni includes almost every known type of North American river and stream, enormous waterfalls, granite peaks, deep canyons, a unique limestone cave system and evidence of ancient rivers. Some 40 types of mammals and 170 bird species call this park home. Galapagos Islands, Ecuador . The 19 islands and surrounding marine reserve that are the Galapagos Islands are part of a unique archipelago of unusual animals, plant life and seismic activity that inspired Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. Located about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from the South American continent where three currents meet in the Pacific Ocean, the Galapagos host an intriguing collection of animal and plant life. Residents include the blue-footed booby, giant tortoises, flightless cormorants and marine iguanas. Some 97% of the total emerged surface was declared a National Park in 1959. The Galapagos Marine Reserve was created in 1986 with an area of 70,000 kilometers and was expanded to 133,000 kilometers in 1998. City of Quito, Ecuador . Named for the Quitus, who lived in the area before the Spanish conquest, the capital city of Ecuador was built in the 16th century on the ruins of an Incan city. Despite many earthquakes, Quito's historic center is quite well-preserved. See the style of the Baroque school of Quito, a fusion of European and indigenous elements, in the monasteries of San Francisco and Santo Domingo and the Church and Jesuit College of La Companía. Built in the old Spanish style, the cathedral, archbishop's palace, government palace and city hall face onto the city's main square. Simien National Park, Ethiopia . Incredible mountain peaks, deep valleys and rare animals call Simien National Park home. You'll find the Walia ibex (a goat found nowhere else in the world), the rare Gelada baboon and Simien fox. There are also leopards, spotted hyenas, jackals and 400 bird species. The park holds incredible significance because of its biodiversity, with views said to rival the Grand Canyon in the United States. However, it was established in an area inhabited by people and faces human and livestock demands on its resources. Rock-Hewn Churches, Lalibela, Ethiopia . At a time when Muslim conquests made it impossible for Christians to make pilgrimages to the Holy Land, King Lalibela decided in the 12th century to build a ""New Jerusalem"" in the mountain region of Ethiopia. The 11 medieval, monolithic cave churches of the 13th century are the result. The churches were hewn from rock, and doors and windows and other parts of the structures were chiseled out. There's also an extensive system of passages, ditches, caves and catacombs. Lalibela's churches and traditional village are still a place of pilgrimage and devotion where the faithful flock to celebrate the important dates of the Ethiopian Christian calendar. Aachen Cathedral, Germany . The Frankish royal estate of Aachen in western Germany had served as a spa since the first century. Soon after Charlemagne took over the government in AD 768, he made the estate his permanent residence and turned it into a center of religion and culture. Emperor Charlemagne´s own Palatine Chapel was the first vaulted structure north of the Alps since Antiquity. The chapel was considered an artistic wonder from its creation. It had bronze doors, columns of Greek and Italian marble and a grand mosaic (now destroyed). The unification of the West under Charlemagne is symbolized in part by the construction of the chapel between 793 and 813. Charlemagne was buried there in 814, and 200 years later, he was canonized -- attracting pilgrims to the site. Krakow's historic center, Poland . The former capital city of Poland, Krakow's historic center has its roots in the 13th century as a merchants' town with Europe's largest market square and one of the oldest university quarters in Europe. Boleslaw the Chaste ordered the old city, called Stare Miasto, be laid out in a strict grid of orthogonal streets in 1257, when he decided to unify the different peoples around the Wawel, a hill inhabited since Paleolithic times and site of the Royal Wawel Castle, which now houses a museum. The beginnings of the castle date back to the 11th century, and there are remnants of fortifications dating back to the 14th century. The Wawel also contains the Royal Treasury and the Gothic cathedral of St. Wenceslas, which hosted many important events for the Polish royal families, including coronations, weddings and funerals. Separate from Stare Miasto, the old district of Kazimierz was the city's Jewish quarter. Kazimierz's Jewish community of 64,000 individuals was deported to Auschwitz. Only 6,000 returned after World War II ended. Wieliczka and Bochnia Salt Mines, Poland . While the Wieliczka and Bochnia Salt Mines in Poland are excellent examples of mining techniques from the 13th to the 20th centuries, there is much more in their underground chambers than a historical ode to the mining of salt. Areas excavated for salt were turned into storehouses, workshops and chapels, with statues and other decorations carved into the rock salt. Tourists have visited the site since the early 19th century. Island of Goree, Senegal . From the 15th century through the 19th century, an estimated 20 million Africans passed through the Island of Goree, the largest slave-trading center on the African coast. Ruled first by the Portuguese and followed by the Dutch, English and French, the island just two miles off the coast houses the elegant homes of the slave traders and the horrific cells in which captured Africans were held before being shipped to the Americas. The Dutch-built House of Slaves, which dates back to 1776, is the last surviving slave house on the island. Listed as a historical site by the colonial administration in 1944, Goree didn't have any subsequent construction that might have damaged the historic elements of the island. Senegal gained its independence in 1960, and the island was inscribed on the independent nation's national heritage list in 1975. Mesa Verde National Park, United States . Spectacular structures of the Pueblo Nation in southwest Colorado are protected at Mesa Verde National Park, where ancient Pueblo dwellings dating from the 6th to the 12th century are still standing at an altitude of more than 8,000 feet. There are impressive villages built on the Mesa top and imposing cliff dwellings built of stone. There is evidence of advanced knowledge of building techniques and irrigation, crucial to surviving in the land in which the Pueblo Nation lived. Yellowstone National Park, United States . Established as the United States' first national park in 1872, Yellowstone National Park is one of the few remaining large, intact ecosystems in the northern temperate zone on Earth. Yellowstone has more than 10,000 thermal features -- about half of all thermal features in the world. It has more than 300 geysers, a volcano and many waterfalls. The park is also home to the few remaining members of the wild, continuously free-ranging bison herd that once roamed the Great Plains.","Nearly 1,000 cultural and natural wonders are ""World Heritage Sites""

"Sun, sand and sea is a delicious recipe by its very nature. Add a plate of ackee and saltfish, a traditional Jamaican dish of the creamy, savory ackee fruit and rehydrated dried fish, and you're well on the way to concocting paradise. A splash of rum won't hurt to add to the mix either. Or, for the braver souls, a generous shot of the liquor in a Red Stripe beer for a local fisherman's drink called a ""steel bottom."" For the rum drinker's benefit, Jamaican side dishes can often be starch-heavy: There's roasted or fried breadfruit, plantains, sweet potatoes and yams to accompany hearty oxtail stews, jerk-spiced meats and curry goat, with staples like the leafy green callaloo, coconut rice and field peas rounding out the mix. Island eating means seafood, and lots of it -- like the fiery pepper shrimp that Jamaican sisters Suzanne and Michelle Rousseau cook up in their new cookbook, ""Caribbean Potluck."" ""Pepper 'swims,' or shrimp seasoned with chili peppers, are sold by shrimp vendors on the roadside and at stoplights in various parts of the island,"" the Rousseaus write.

"A federal judge on Wednesday denied Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's bid to move the location of his upcoming trial, even while moving back its scheduled start date. Explaining his decision to have a jury weigh Tsarnaev's fate near where the bombings and subsequent violent incidents with police occurred, U.S. District Judge George O'Toole said, ""Although the media coverage in this case has been extensive, at this stage the defendant has failed to show that it has so inflamed and pervasively prejudiced the pool that a fair and impartial jury cannot be impaneled in the (eastern division of the District of Massachusetts)."" O'Toole's ruling means that the trial in one of the most scarring episodes in Boston history will stay in Boston. With his older brother Tamerlan, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is accused of planting two explosives hidden inside backpacks on April 15, 2013, along downtown Boston's busy Boylston Street near the marathon's finish line. The bombs exploded 12 seconds apart, killing 8-year-old Martin Richard, 29-year-old Krystle Campbell and Lingzi Lu, a Boston University graduate student from China, and injuring more than 200 others. Mourning, resolve and quest for answers after deadly bombs . Three days later, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer named Sean Collier was shot and killed on campus -- allegedly by the bombing suspects. Then, early on April 19, authorities say the Tsarnaev brothers hijacked a car in nearby Cambridge, then exchanged gunfire and thew explosives out the window when police began to chase them. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died in that exchange. His younger brother wasn't found until the next day, bloodied and in a boat parked in a Watertown, Massachusetts, backyard. The marathon bombings and subsequent manhunt spurred intense media coverage in Massachusetts and beyond. ""Boston Strong"" became an often repeated mantra in the region as locals rallied in support of one another and in opposition to those behind the violence. The attention spurred Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to ask for his trial to be moved out of Massachusetts, his lawyers arguing ""that pretrial publicity and public sentiment"" jeopardized his opportunity for a fair trial. O'Toole shot down the defense case on several grounds, including the argument that 12 impartial jurors couldn't be found in the area. He noted that Massachusetts' eastern federal district has about 5 million people. ""It stretches the imagination to suggest that an impartial jury cannot be successfully selected from this large pool of potential jurors,"" the judge wrote. It's not like only Massachusetts residents know about this case, he added. For a time, this was a huge international story -- meaning that people from coast-to-coast, and not just around Boston, might have formed opinions about it he said. ""It is doubtful whether a jury could be selected anywhere in the country whose members were wholly unaware of the marathon bombings,"" O'Toole said. Tsarnaev faces more than 30 federal charges tied to the entire episode, including using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death. Bomb suspect pleads not guilty . Federal prosecutors announced earlier this year that they will seek the death penalty against him, arguing he acted in ""an especially heinous, cruel and depraved manner"" and lacks remorse. While Tsarnaev wasn't able to move his trial location, he did win -- at least partially -- in one regard Wednesday: His trial date has been delayed. The defense had asked that the trial be pushed back from November 3 to September 1, 2015, due to the large volume of information -- or ""discovery"" -- in the case. O'Toole delayed the trial until January 5, 2015, not long after the final pretrial conference hearing set for December 18.","Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is accused in the Boston Marathon bombing, killing police officer .

"The Obama administration is sending prosecutors and law enforcement advisers abroad, and urging other countries to overhaul their laws to make it easier to prosecute people who return after being involved in terrorism. Attorney General Eric Holder said Thursday that the Justice Department has dispatched lawyers to 14 countries -- four in the Balkan region and 10 in North Africa and the Middle East -- to work with policymakers there. ""These personnel will provide critical assistance to our allies in order to help prosecute those who return from the Syrian region bent on committing acts of terrorism,"" Holder said at press conference. His comments came after Holder met with his European counterparts to discuss the issue. Holder said the State Department's Bureau of Counterterrorism is also sending staffers to those regions to aid what will be a ""government-wide effort."" One objective is to ramp up international cooperation in areas such as ""information sharing, investigations and prosecutions, and countering violent extremism,"" Holder said. ""Our goal is to build the capacity to fight foreign terrorist fighters within the rule of law -- so we can the stop flow of fighters into conflict regions, stem the tide of violence and aggressively combat violent extremism,"" Holder said. ""We can succeed only as partners."" The move comes the same day a French court sentenced a 28-year-old man to seven years in prison for participating in jihad in Syria. Flavien Moreau is the first French citizen to be tried for joining an Islamist group in Syria, according to Elisabeth Allanic, spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor's office. Moreau's lawyer, Pierre Darkanian, told CNN that his client had been to Syria in November 2012 ""for less than 10 days."" According to Darkanian, Moreau joined a group fighting against President Bashar al-Assad, but did not participate in combat. ""He wanted to bring first-aid care,"" the lawyer said. A heavy smoker, Moreau couldn't stand the smoking restrictions in place in the group and came back to France partly to buy Nicorette gum. He was arrested a few weeks later, in January 2013. Darkanian called the sentence ""unjustified."" ""My client is being sentenced purely on the basis of intentions,"" he said. ""Materially, he did not commit any unlawful acts."" Moreau was among more than 900 French nationals the government believes fought in Syria and Iraq. Farid Djebbar, 26, was sentenced to 30 months in jail as part of the same trial, said his lawyer, Daphne Pugliesi. Djebbar had maintained correspondence with Moreau and received money from him. He had consulted various jihadist websites, including some content on making bombs, authorities said. ""This is a very tough verdict. Since this is the first jihadist trial, they wanted to hit very strong and make an example,"" Pugliesi said. Djebbar won't appeal. ""He is tired and he knows that justice won't listen to him,"" his lawyer said. The French Parliament recently passed new anti-terrorism legislation to respond to the increasing concern about French nationals traveling to Syria and Iraq to join ISIS or other jihadist groups. The legislation is aimed at preventing anyone from entering or exiting French territory if there are strong reasons to believe that there is intent to travel to take part in terror-related activities, war crimes or crimes against humanity. The travel ban could include the confiscation of passports and identification cards. Through the new law, French authorities can also require Internet providers to block content or access to websites calling to conduct or praising terror acts. More than 100 of the foreign fighters in Iraq and Syria have come from the United States, according to intelligence estimates; hundreds more from Europe.

"Nancy Pelosi doesn't understand why House Speaker John Boehner and newly-elected Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have been on the cover of Time magazine in light of their electoral victories, but she has not. ""I was never on Time magazine cover even though I was first women to be (Speaker),"" Rep. Pelosi, D-California, said. ""Isn't that a curiosity? That the Republicans win, Boehner's on Time magazine. Mitch McConnell wins, he's on the cover of Time magazine. Isn't there a pattern here?"" Pelosi's comments came as a reaction to a press conference question Thursday about whether she has considered stepping down as minority leader in light of the Democrats losing the House for the fourth time since she led the chamber in 2011. Charging that the question was unnecessary, Pelosi said she is now thinking that she has ""a mission for women on this score."" 'When was the day when any of you said Mitch McConnell, when they lost (taking back) the Senate three times in a row, 'Aren't you getting a little old, Mitch? Shouldn't you step aside,'"" Pelosi asked. ""Have any of you ever asked him that question?"" ""It's just is interesting as a women to see how many time that question asked as a women and how many times that question is never asked of Mitch McConnell,"" she continued. Pelosi, a 27-year veteran of Congress, said the issue shouldn't have even come up, and that her record and speaks for itself.

"The man accused of killing the McStay family pleaded not guilty Wednesday in a California court to murder charges. Charles ""Chase"" Merritt, 57, was a close friend and business partner of Joseph McStay, whose body -- along with those of his wife Summer and their two young sons, Gianni and Joseph Jr. -- was found November 2013. The family disappeared in February 2010. In an exclusive interview, San Bernardino County District Attorney Mike Ramos told CNN that authorities had been watching Merritt, closely for some time before arresting him last week. ""There was no doubt in our mind this was the person that committed the murders,"" Ramos said. ""His story is all over the place."" Merritt did not speak during Wednesday's hearing in San Bernardino County Superior Court. His next appearance is set for November 20. His lawyer spoke to reporters outside. ""I'm going to do everything that I can for Mr. Merritt, everything in my power, to be able to represent him -- do everything that I can to be able to help him in this case -- to specifically see if there isn't a way that with the tragedy that's taken place, that that tragedy not extend to him and not extend to his family also,"" said attorney Robert Ponce. Prosecutors have not yet said whether they will pursue the death penalty. Police say they believe the family died of ""blunt force trauma"" inside their home north of San Diego, but they declined to discuss specifics of the deaths or a motive. Suspect no stranger to family . Earlier this year, CNN interviewed Merritt, who said at the time he had ""absolutely no clue"" what happened to the McStays. Merritt and McStay met for a business lunch in Rancho Cucamonga on February 4, 2010, the day the family disappeared. ""I am definitely the last person he saw,"" Merritt said during the January interview. Merritt also told CNN he and Joseph McStay were also on the phone constantly, perhaps 12 to 13 times that day. There was another call from McStay's phone to Merritt the night of the family's disappearance. It came about 40 minutes after a neighbor's security camera captured the family's Isuzu pulling out of their cul-de-sac. Merritt didn't answer. Merritt told CNN he was watching television with his then-girlfriend, and he picked up the phone, looked at it and set it back down. He was tired. He called back the next day, he said. ""There are hundreds of scenarios. I have gone over all of them in my head,"" he said. ""Of course, I regret not picking up the phone."" Merritt was questioned by police after the disappearance. They just asked him the ""standard questions,"" he said. He also claimed to have taken a polygraph test.

"(CNN)Unless you've been stuck in a mine shaft or visiting a distant planet for the past few decades, chances are you've heard of Bob Marley and Usain Bolt and can identify both as the most famous sons of Jamaican soil. Beyond reggae and track icons, however, there are many fascinating things less widely known about ""Jamrock"" that make this island of just 3 million people stand out. Here are eight things to know for starters: . James Bond's birthplace . Ian Fleming conjured up and penned the thrilling international spy novels known the world over by their larger-than-life, women- and evildoer-conquering protagonist, James Bond, in Oracabessa, a sleepy village in the parish of St. Mary on Jamaica's north coast. Fleming named his rustic property Goldeneye after a World War II operation in which he'd taken part as an intelligence officer. An avid birder, Fleming took 007's name from the American author of ""Birds of the West Indies."" Travel photos we wish we'd taken . The first James Bond film, ""Dr. No,"" was filmed in Jamaica, where the villain's lair, actually a bauxite storage facility owned by Noranda, is hard to miss in Discovery Bay. And later in the film, Ursula Andress walked out of the surf and into movie history at one of Jamaica's most spectacular beaches, Laughing Waters, located just west of Ocho Rios, where cool river water cascades directly into the warm Caribbean sea. After Fleming's death, his Goldeneye property was sold to Island Records founder Chris Blackwell, who has transformed it into Jamaica's most exclusive boutique hotel and villa resort. 10 things you didn't know about Las Vegas . Roots of banana trade and Caribbean tourism . Jamaica gave birth to the global banana trade and Caribbean tourism. In the late 1800s, steamships began plying routes between the Northeast United States and the parishes of St. Thomas, Portland and St. Mary in northeast Jamaica. When these steamships began carrying passengers seeking relief from the New England winter on the southbound journey, Caribbean tourism was born. Steamship captain Lorenzo Dow Baker was a pioneer in the banana trade and served as president of the Boston Fruit Company, which later became United Fruit Company through a merger and more recently became Chiquita Brands International. The banana industry waned in Jamaica in the face of crop disease and larger, more competitive plantations established in Central America. Today the island's largest banana grower is Jamaica Producers, a locally held company that targets domestic and international markets with a range of agricultural products. Delicious coffee . Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee is among the most prized, and expensive, in the world, fetching upwards of U.S.$30 a pound. High elevation cloud forests make for an ideal long growing season and slow maturation period for coffee berries, ultimately yielding beans with a strong, full-bodied flavor void of the bitterness typical of coffee grown in other regions. Japanese coffee connoisseurs are the leading buyers of Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee, which is a registered international trademark like Champagne, and regulated by Jamaica's Coffee Industry Board. One of the best ways to learn about and taste Jamaica's coffee is with a farm or factory tour. The Twyman family's Old Tavern Estate is an excellent option, offering visitors a trip back in time to the days of small-scale cottage industry production. The Sharp family operates the neighboring Clifton Mount coffee farm with a slightly larger scale, more industrialized business. Mavis Bank Coffee Factory also offers tours. The buzzing factory buys its beans from thousands of farmers and is the largest industrial coffee processing and roasting operation in the Blue Mountains that opens its doors to visitors. 10 things to know before visiting Sicily . Few Rastafarians . While locked hair might be the most famous ""do"" associated with the island, Jamaican adherents to the Rastafarian movement make up less than 2% of the population, actually just 1.1%, according to the CIA World Factbook. The iconic natural hairstyles associated with Rastafarians are anything but the norm on the island, where instead, chemically treated straightened hair, extensions, weaves and wigs are the norm for women, and most men rock short-cropped coifs. A refuge for exiled Jews and religious diversity . Jamaica became a refuge for exiled Jews fleeing the Spanish Inquisition. The Spanish crown, which ruled the island between 1492 and 1655, took a more relaxed stance on religious freedom, or at least a ""don't ask, don't tell"" approach. Kingston's active synagogue attests to the island's small, yet prominent, Jewish community today. Today Jamaica has more churches per capita than any other country. The Anglican Church played a significant role during the slave period in maintaining order on the island and quelling discontent, while the Baptist Church, on the other hand, fueled slave uprisings ultimately leading to emancipation in 1834. It would be difficult to find a religion not represented in Jamaica, and where a church structure doesn't exist, Jamaicans are inclined to erect a tent for pop-up service. Pentecostals, Moravians, Catholics, Methodists, Seventh Day Adventists, Revivalists, Muslims, Hindus, Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses are all well represented, among numerous other faiths and denominations. Marijuana is illegal in Jamaica . Despite the ubiquitous posters of Bob Marley and Peter Tosh with burning joints dangling from their mouths, marijuana is still illegal in Jamaica. But its legal status is slowly evolving. This year legislation was introduced to decriminalize marijuana use and develop a regulated medical and recreational marijuana industry following similar U.S. initiatives in Colorado and Washington State. The movement to decriminalize has been led in the political sphere by Minister of Justice Mark Golding, who announced in June that people carrying up to 2 ounces of pot will only be hit with a small fine, rather than be charged, and the infraction wouldn't result in a police record. Jamaicans with police records attributable to marijuana use charges will have their names cleared, enabling them to seek formal employment and travel visas. Jamaica is more than sun and sand . The original name Xaymaca, bestowed by its original Taino inhabitants, means ""land of wood and water,"" fitting for a mountainous island endowed with several distinct climatic zones, from arid near-desert conditions complete with sand dunes along the south coast to tropical rain forest in the northeast to high elevation alpine areas where nighttime temperatures fall below freezing in the Blue and John Crow Mountains. This climatic diversity and abundant fresh water from subterranean springs and rivers crisscrossing every parish, affords the relatively small island excellent conditions for growing a wide range of crops. A hike up to Blue Mountain Peak is a great way to take a break from the beach and get a bit of a workout. On a clear day, the summit affords spectacular views of Kingston and the coastline of several parishes meeting the Caribbean sea to the East, North and South. The Blue Mountains also provide bird watchers an opportunity to spot many of the island's 280 species, 30 of which are endemic. Jamaican food is reason enough to visit the island . While the country may be known for its jerk seasoning, which features local agricultural products like pimento (allspice) and hot Scotch bonnet peppers, Jamaican cuisine has much more to offer and the island's lively foodie culture may be the best representation of its national motto, ""Out of Many, One People."" The influence of Indian cuisine is hard to miss, and curried goat, shrimp, lobster or vegetables are staples. Of course the seafood is hard to beat, with escovitch  snapper borrowing elements from Spanish cuisine, while the accompaniment of fried bammy, made from cassava root, couldn't be more local, as it was a staple starch for the original Taino inhabitants. The abundant fresh produce and quality of the ingredients on the island make it a natural manufacturing center for entrepreneurs concocting a wide array of sauces and preserves for the local market and export. Pickapeppa may be the most widely known condiment produced in Jamaica, but other more recent products on the scene, from Walkerswood to Belcour Preserves, are every bit as good. To get a taste of Jamaica's best flavors, stop by Belcour in Maryland district in the Blue Mountains to sample mouthwatering chutneys, pepper sauces and preserves and walk among citrus orchards, orchid gardens and the apiary, or spend a few nights on the town in Kingston to sample the island's best restaurants. Jakes boutique resort in Treasure Beach holds regular farm-to-table dinners that are lively affairs featuring a rotating cast of guest chefs.

"Iran's parliament could pick the country's leaders ""in the distant future"" rather than having Iranians elect a president by popular vote, the Islamic republic's supreme leader suggested Sunday. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei floated the idea in a speech to university students in western Iran's Kermanshah province on Sunday, according to a transcript posted on his website. Though he couched the idea in conditional terms, his remarks come amid an ongoing power struggle between the country's clerical leadership and its outspoken president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. ""The current political system of the country is presidential, and the president is elected directly by the people. This is a good and effective system,"" said Khamenei, who has led Iran since 1989. ""But if one day, possibly in the distant future, it is felt that a parliamentary system is more suited for electing those responsible for the executive branch, then there would be no problems in making changes in the system."" Khamenei raised the subject himself after being asked about reaching ideals such as justice and freedom under the Islamic system. His allies dominate the Majlis, Iran's parliament, as well as the judiciary, and they have been critical of Ahmadinejad in recent months. The supreme leader backed Ahmadinejad through the tumult that followed his hotly disputed 2009 re-election, urging Iranians to accept the results of the balloting when protesters in the streets declared it a fraud. Khamenei presided over a crackdown on the demonstrations, during which security forces were unleashed on crowds and activists were prosecuted and jailed. But Sunday, he noted that the Islamic republic's founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, eliminated the post of prime minister in the 1980s and suggested the same thing could be done for the presidency. ""Of course, any change and modernization and reviewing of policies must be based on Islamic principles. The changes must also conform with the Constitution,"" he said. But he added that the Iranian system can manage change ""without deviation from the path"" of the 1979 revolution that ousted the country's Western-allied monarchy and brought the ayatollahs to power.","Iran could have parliament pick leaders ""in the distant future,"" Khamenei says .

"What a difference two years makes. When Barack Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to visit Myanmar in 2012, there was much fanfare about the country's political reforms and apparent road to democracy after decades of oppressive military rule. But as Obama and other world leaders gather in Myanmar this week for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit, the situation is not as rosy as many had hoped. ""Parts of the reform effort have stalled, parts have moved forward, and parts we've even seen things move backward,"" Deputy U.S. National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said Thursday. ""So I think it's a mixed picture."" Two years after Obama's historic visit, Myanmar's parliament is still largely dominated by the military. And the human rights crisis faced by the Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state is as dire as ever. 'Internment camps' The crisis in Rakhine state began in May 2012, when the rape and murder of a Buddhist woman by Muslim men ignited long-standing tensions between the Rakhine Buddhist majority and Rohingya Muslims. In 2012, clashes between Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingyas, a long-oppressed linguistic and ethnic minority in this majority Buddhist country, left hundreds of people dead and more than 140,000 people homeless. Across Rakhine state, more than 130,000 other displaced people are trapped in 67 camps. The majority of them are de facto stateless Muslims, living under apartheid-like conditions. Most have been there since the violence in October 2012, after their villages were destroyed. They endure wretched conditions, such as frequent flooding and filthy water. Skin diseases and gastrointestinal problems are common. But they can't leave without police escort. That rule is ""to prevent further clashes and (ensure) their safety,"" Minister of Information Ye Htut told CNN. But the settlements ""have essentially become internment camps"" for about 140,000 people, according to a report by the International Crisis Group. ""People have been here two years and they have nothing. Nothing,"" a humanitarian worker said. ""The desperation is extremely high, and it's increasing."" President Thein Sein reportedly told a visiting United Nations delegation that the government did not recognize the Rohingya as citizens of Myanmar, also known as Burma, and was planning to install them in refugee camps until another country could be found to take them. Obama and the Burmese president will meet this week. Joshua Kurlantzick, a senior fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, said Obama should pressure the Myanmar government to push ahead with political changes and rethink its ""racist"" plan for the Rohingya. But a senior U.S. official cautioned not to expect any major leaps forward any time soon. ""I don't think we're going to see breakthroughs in the short term,"" said Tom Malinowski, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for human rights and labor. ""Burma was an opening to a breakthrough, and it's one that we always knew would take years to move from its starting point to its finishing point."" Stunted democracy . On top of the Rohingya human rights crisis, Myanmar is no where near the democratic country that some had hoped for. After decades in power, the country's military junta stepped down, and a civilian government was sworn in to office in 2011. But the military still has substantial power. The country's current constitution stipulates that 25% of the seats in parliament are held by members of the military, and the military has veto power. Obama will meet with fellow Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi on Friday. The pro-democracy icon spent years under house arrest by the country's military rulers before becoming a parliamentarian in 2012. While many democracy advocates want Suu Kyi to run for president next year, the government prohibits it. The Burmese constitution, written by the military in 2008, forbids anyone married to a foreigner to become president. Suu Kyi's husband, who died in 1999, was British. Even Suu Kyi has come under criticism for staying largely silent on the Rohingya crisis.","World leaders are gathering in Myanmar for the ASEAN summit .

"We journeyed down Alaska's Seward Highway when a story appeared before us like a supernatural vision. A wave, a long wave, stretched shore to shore, beneath a panorama of snow and icy-gray November splendor in Alaska's Cook Inlet. And there it was, in the distance. ""They're surfing! Surfing in Alaska!"" I exclaimed in immature glee to CNN photographer Jeff King, who was driving. He and I are a journalistic light infantry: We get our assignments, grab a LiveU (a video phone that replaces a satellite truck) and off we go to far-flung destinations to report on politics. Now we entered hyper-drive to document a traveler's surprise: We wanted to catch a wave and a surfer on camera. In Alaska. In 32 degrees. We pulled over. I took the wheel. And Jeff began filming out of the window of the SUV rental. Just who was this mystery surfer? Would they be a good interview? We arrived on the shore to meet the arctic surfer. The trim athlete in the black wetsuit, hood and gloves was a 22-year-old woman. Hailey Driver, as it turns out, is an Alaskan adventurer who seems as if she's jacked up on adrenalin, Mountain Dew and caramel corn. Could we film her? Why yes, she said. By the way, she added, do you want some video she made of herself using a GoPro camera? And with a drone flying overhead? Some stories come gift-wrapped. Driver told us about the thrill of the Alaskan surf and about the constant strain on the thighs during 15-minute rides on the tidal bore. ""You just wait for the bore tide to take you away,"" she said. ""You ride it for as long as you can go, which can be miles."" What in the name of the Beach Boys is a tidal bore? This rarity from Mother Nature occurs when the edge of the incoming tide gets pushed up by the outgoing flow of a river or narrow inlet's current, forming a wave. There are a few dozen tidal bores shredding the globe, in all climates and perhaps most dramatically in Canada's Bay of Fundy. Alaska gave Jeff and me our first glimpse of a tidal bore. We love this state. During a prior trip, we played a hunch and found Sarah Palin voting in a hockey rink on Super Tuesday and had a nice live chat in 2012. Now we found Hailey Driver surfing in 40-degree water between so much amazing scenery. Even she says it's hard to stay focused and not fall off the board.","Alaska's Cook Inlet is home to 15-minute long tidal bores .

"For the world's Muslims, the festival of Eid al-Fitr is a perfect conclusion to Ramadan -- the month-long period of fasting and contemplation practiced by observers of Islam around the globe. One of the most festive periods in the religion's calendar, Eid is often commemorated with large feasts, family-time, and through charitable acts and donations. As part of CNN's series celebrating the most spectacular festivals and events across the globe, we asked our readers to share their images of Eid traditions, both past and present. In response, we discovered a rich narrative of the holiday, and customs as diverse as the people who celebrate them. For Yassir O. Nassif in Saudi Arabia, Eid means measuring his three-year-old son Mazin up for new clothes, in this case a brand new customized thobe, a traditional ankle length garment commonly worn in Gulf countries. But the holiday is not just about the outfits -- it's about the family, he says. Sweet Eid: Breaking the fast with world's tastiest treats . ""We have scheduled breakfasts, lunches and dinners -- I never knew how exhausting it was on my parents until I became one myself,"" he said. ""But I enjoyed it as a kid and would love my children to have the same pleasures. After all it's only three days, better make the best of them and make each day count!"" The wearing of new clothes and looking one's best for the festivities can, for women, extend to the hennaing of hands -- a ritual captured by Laurens Meulman while visiting Agra, home of the iconic Taj Mahal in India. ""The henna-painted hands of one of the women in the group caught my eye and I asked her if I could to take a photo,"" Meulman said. Though not Muslim herself, she says the holiday always reminds her of ""good food, sweets, sharing, being with family and generosity. "" In Malaysia, family preoccupied the thoughts of Dina Syazwani Sipal Anuwar, a 24-year-old teacher from Selangor who sent in an image via Instagram of her family in matching colored clothes celebrating Eid last year. The photo is particularly poignant for Dina as it was the last Eid her father, Sipal, a policeman, was able to spend with his family before he unexpectedly passed away in January. ""I think it was one of the signs that father would leave us, the last Eid we could take a perfect photo as a whole family,"" she said. CNN Celebrates: View all Eid photos on iReport . Respect and appreciation for others was also on the mind of graphic designer Anupama Kinagi in Mumbai, India, when he captured this affectionate moment outside a mosque in the city and related a poignant custom put on by local authorities. He said that the police officer outside the mosque ""especially arranges for rose flowers to greet Muslims outside on this special day,"" he says. ""Muslims accept their wishes and thank them for their extraordinary service."" Of course, after a month of fasting, food takes center stage. Libyan-American Sammi Addahoumi, currently spending his summer in the Libyan city of Benghazi, satisfies his sweet tooth with delicious sweets made in a local bakery.

"Paris (CNN)It's a tiger's tail. That's what French citizens say they saw Thursday in woods and other areas not far from Disneyland Paris, according to a local official. While authorities haven't managed to corner the animal, all witnesses identified it as a tiger, according to Cédric Tartaud-Gineste, mayoral cabinet director in Montévrain. The town's Facebook page indicates the animal is young. Montévrain Mayor Christian Robache told CNN affiliate BFM that authorities believe the tiger was domesticated, though an investigation is ongoing. As the hunt for the cat continues, local residents were told to stay inside and, if they have to go out, to drive rather than walk. Both Chessy and Montévrain are adjacent to the Disney amusement park, which is about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Paris. Yet there was no mention of the feline on the Disneyland Paris Twitter page, and park spokeswoman Cathy Pianon said the park's security team -- while it was working closely with local authorities -- was never asked to reinforce their security. Pianon said operations weren't being affected at the park, which she described as closed and well guarded. Dear or alive, hunt for man-eating tiger won't end well for conservationist .

"(CNN) -- Did we almost lose Bono? The rear hatch of the aircraft taking the U2 lead singer from Dublin to Berlin was missing when the aircraft landed at Berlin Schonefeld Airport on Wednesday. Besides Bono (whose real name is Paul Hewson), there were two pilots and four other passengers on board, according to Germout Freitag, an official with the German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation. U2 is scheduled to perform Thursday at the Bambi Awards, Germany's version of the Emmys. Other members of the band were traveling separately. The ground crew discovered that the hatch was missing shortly after the aircraft landed at 12:26 a.m., 11 minutes after it blew off, Freitag said. Bono apologizes for free iTunes album . ""The ground crew realized the door was gone and two suitcases had fallen out,"" Freitag said. ""Officials have not yet located the two suitcases or the hatch door, but they have been able to pinpoint the area where they are likely to have landed by the radar."" The bureau has started in an investigation into the incident's cause. ""The investigation will take at least six to eight weeks and will be greatly hampered if the door is not located,"" Freitag said. While officials ""have no idea at the moment what caused this and need to examine both the door and the area of the plane,"" Freitag said he believes the rear hatch was not properly closed. ""This sort of thing is not common."" Bono didn't seem fazed by the midair scare. A short time later, he met with Walter Lindner, Germany's special representative on Ebola. With his suitcases missing, we're not sure what he wore. But the tweet from Germany's foreign office suggests it was his signature black. .","The airplane carrying Bono landed with its rear hatch missing .

"It's an image that tugs at the heartstrings.  A smiling 7-year-old girl poses in her cheerleading uniform, circled by a ring of pompons, her bald head a telltale sign of her chemotherapy treatments. The photo hit Facebook last year and popped up all over with messages of support. ""Like"" to show this little girl you care. ""Share"" to tell her she's beautiful. Pray for her to beat cancer. But here's the truth. The photo was nearly six years old. And neither the girl, nor her parents -- who never posted it to Facebook -- had any idea it was being used that way. Welcome to the world of Facebook ""like farming."" Those waves of saccharin-sweet posts that sometimes fill your news feed may seem harmless. But all too often, they're being used for nefarious purposes. At best, a complete stranger may be using the photos to stroke their own ego. At worst, experts say, scammers and spammers are using Facebook, often against the site's rules, to make some easy cash. And they're wiling to play on the good intentions of Facebook users to do it. ""The average user doesn't know any better,"" said Tim Senft, founder of Facecrooks.com, a website that monitors scams and other illegal or unethical behavior on Facebook. ""I think their common sense tells them it's not true, but in the back of their minds, they think 'What if it is true? What does it hurt if I press like?' or whatever."" What does it hurt? ""I was first shocked,"" said Amanda Rieth of Northampton, Pennsylvania, whose daughter was the subject of that photo. ""And then infuriated."" After being notified by a friend who recognized the girl in a Facebook post, Rieth tracked the image back to a link she'd posted to her Photobucket account in a community forum in 2009, two years after it was taken. Her daughter, who was diagnosed with Stage IV neuroblastoma in early 2007, has been featured in local news segments for her fundraising efforts to fight cancer through Alex's Lemonade Stand. But her mom said she was always part of the decision and was happy to help publicize the fight. ""This? This was entirely different and entirely out of our control,"" Rieth said. ""That's the most gut-wrenching part: the total lack of control."" Hurting the people featured in the posts, and their families, isn't the only risk of sharing such content. Sometimes, a single click can help people who are up to no good. Often, Senft said, Facebook pages are created with the sole purpose of spreading viral content that will get lots of likes and shares. Once the page creators have piled up hundreds of thousands of  likes and shares, they'll strip the page and promote something else, like products that they get a commission for selling. Or, they may turn around and sell the page through black-market websites to someone who does the same. It's a way to trick Facebook's algorithm, which is designed to give more value to popular pages than the ones, like scams and spam, that pop up overnight. ""The more likes and shares and comments and that sort of thing you have, the more likely it is to be seen by other people,"" Senft said. ""If they're looking to sell the page in a black-hat forum somewhere, that's what the value of the page is."" It gets worse . Sometimes, the threat is more direct. The ""new"" page may be used to spread malware -- software that attacks the user's computer -- or for phishing, the act of trying to gather credit card numbers, passwords or other personal information through links to phony giveaways or contests. Simply liking a post, or the page itself, can't spread a virus or phish a user. But malicious Facebook apps can, as can external links that page owners may choose to share to their followers. If the page owner has access to Facebook's developer tools, they can collect data on the people who like the page. Personal information like gender, location and age can be used to target more personalized attacks. The kind of posts used run a gamut from cute to tasteless, from manipulative to misleading. Rieth said she still finds her daughter's photo on Facebook from time to time, even though Facebook eventually deleted the original after she and others reported it. On the most recent page she found, the picture appears in a feed alongside posts such as ""Who loves French fries? Like & share if you do"" and multiple images encouraging people to like and share if they love Jesus. There's an image of a premature baby, pictures of military troops cuddling puppies and an image of a young boy pouring water on a man's cigarette with the text ""Sorry papa ... I need you."" ""It's anything that's going to kind of tug at the heartstrings: the sick kids, the animal abuse, acting like it's some kind of pet shelter,"" Senft said. ""That's the bad part with the scammers. They hit people where they're vulnerable, play on their emotions."" What to do . Because of Facebook's sheer size, he said it sometimes takes lots of reports for the site to delete an offensive or misleading image, or shut down the page it came from. The best approach, Senft said, is to think before sharing. ""If it sounds too good to be true, don't click on it,"" he said. ""If it's something that's obviously geared toward tugging on the heartstrings, check it out first."" Facebook said it continues to work to make sure high-quality content surfaces for users and low-quality posts don't. That includes trying to diminish the reach of posts that appear to be ""like farming"" attempts. ""People have told us they associate requests to like or share a post with lower quality content, and receiving that type of feedback helps us adjust our systems to get better at showing more high quality posts,"" a Facebook spokesperson said via e-mail. ""If you see a post that's low quality and seems to be focused only on gaining traffic, hover over the top-right corner of the post and click the arrow to report it."" Facebook uses ""automated and manual methods to swiftly remove links and pages that violate our policies,"" the spokesperson said. ""We're always making improvements to our detection and blocking systems to stay ahead of threats."" 'Truly angry' Today, Rieth's daughter is 13 -- an eighth-grader who has shown no signs of her cancer since September 2007. But her mom compares that cheerleading photo to the mythical hydra, a monster with many heads that sprouts two more each time one is cut off. Based just on the images she's found and reported, the photo has been liked and shared on Facebook hundreds of thousands of times. A search Monday also found it popping up on Pinterest, as well as one site where it was wrongly used alongside a 2010 article about actor Jackie Chan helping a girl with leukemia find a bone-marrow donor. ""What makes me truly angry, though, is knowing that they're using it as an insidious way to make money,"" Rieth said. ""That's not what her survival is about to us."" For this article, CNN sent a Facebook message to the owner of the last page where Rieth found the photo. When asked whether he planned to sell his page, the owner replied with two words: . ""How much?""","""Like farming"" on Facebook takes advantage of users' good intentions to make posts go viral .

"Honey Boo Boo's mother is coming clean about her past, which she says includes her involvement with a second sex offender. In an exclusive interview with ""Entertainment Tonight"" to begin airing Thursday, reality TV matriarch June ""Mama June"" Shannon explains why she was seen in the company of Mark Anthony McDaniel, a man who served 10 years in prison after being convicted of aggravated child molestation in 2004 and who is a registered sex offender. Shannon also says the father of two of her children is another man who was convicted of a sex crime. ""Shannon also revealed for the first time her claim that Pumpkin's biological father is also the father of her 18-year-old daughter Jessica,"" according to ET online. ""His name is Michael Anthony Ford, he is a convicted sex offender who served time for sexual exploitation of minors after being caught on 'To Catch a Predator' in 2005."" Her rumored involvement with McDaniel -- who was recently released after serving a 10-year sentence -- touched off a firestorm that resulted in the cancellation of the popular TLC reality show ""Here Comes Honey Boo Boo"" in October. The show centered around Shannon and her family, including 9-year-old daughter Alana ""Honey Boo Boo"" Thompson, who came to fame competing in child beauty pageants. TLC ends production on 'Honey Boo Boo' It was announced in September that Shannon had split with Alana's father, longtime love Mike ""Sugar Bear"" Thompson. Shannon's oldest daughter, Anna ""Chickadee"" Cardwell, 20, has said McDaniel molested her when she was 8. Shannon told ET's Brooke Anderson that she does believe ""that something happened"" between her daughter and McDaniel and that she's ""told Anna not to bring up the past again. It would be hard for me."" She said she's seen him only twice since his release, once coincidentally and once at an arranged meeting for her 14-year-old daughter, Lauryn ""Pumpkin"" Shannon, who grew up believing McDaniel was her father. ""Since 2 months to almost 6 years, she knew nobody but him,"" Shannon said. ""She was starting to resent Anna, and she was starting to ask me questions. I can't answer those questions for Pumpkin."" But Shannon now says Pumpkin's biological father is actually Ford. ""Jessica and Pumpkin have the same dad, but Jessica's dad has had nothing to do with her over the years,"" she said. ""So, why the hell would I open up that can of worms until today? I lied to my family and told them it was somebody else."" Shannon said she wanted to do the interview to clear the air.

"President Barack Obama could take action as early as next week to protect undocumented immigrants with American-born children and those who entered the United States as children themselves from deportation, an administration official familiar with the plan told CNN. The official said Obama could sign an executive order bypassing lawmakers and implementing those changes on his own by next week -- though the White House says it hasn't nailed down the timing or content and that final decisions won't come until Obama returns from his Asia trip. The move has been the subject of months of anticipation. But with lame duck legislative wrangling underway on Capitol Hill, the president's advisers could also wait until next month. While not specifying when Obama might make his move, the White House said Thursday he's nearing a final decision on how to repair a system both Republicans and Democrats admit needs fixing. And while officials say the specifics of what he will announce haven't been finalized, the broad contours of a potential plan that eases deportations for millions of undocumented immigrants have been floated by immigration groups for months. For the multitude of groups who are watching the process unfold, the moment is charged. ""Without hesitation I can say the level of anticipation is intense. We were hoping this would happen in September,"" said Clarissa Martinez, deputy vice president of the National Council of La Raza. ""It's long overdue. The sooner the better."" Millions affected . An expansion of Obama's ""deferred action"" program (DACA) that went into place in the summer of 2012 is considered by immigration activists a likely component of Obama's immigration action. DACA delayed deportation proceedings for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States by their parents as children. There were caveats on who was eligible: in order to apply, immigrants needed to be younger than 31 at the time the rule was enacted, and younger than 16 when they were brought to the U.S. And applicants are required to either be in school, have earned a high school degree, or be honorably discharged veterans. The Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, says 1.2 million people were eligible under those rules and nearly 700,000 applied for deferred deportation, with hundreds of thousands more aging into the requirements over the next decade. But many more would become eligible if Obama expands, or eliminates altogether, those requirements, which were meant to encompass the same sector that would have qualified for permanent resident status under the DREAM Act, which has languished in Congress. That could mean extending deportation relief to the parents of U.S. citizens, a move that would bring another 3.4 million people into the eligibility ranks, according to a Migration Policy Institute analysis. If the parents of children who are eligible under the current DACA rules are also included, the number rises to 3.7 million. Changing those rules could also expand the eligible population: eliminating the education requirement, for example, would allow 430,000 more undocumented immigrants to be eligible for deferred deportation, the Migration Policy Institute estimates. And allowing people over 30 who were brought to the U.S. by undocumented parents would allow another 200,000 immigrants to apply, the think-tank's report says. Immigration activists, frustrated with the rate of deportations under Obama and further exasperated with the delay in Obama's immigration action, have been urging the White House to go big and expand the deferred deportation order in a way that allow the maximum number of people to stay. But many who have been watching the process closely believe the eventual announcement will fall short of those appeals. ""We have been making the case all along with activists and scholars that the president could provide relief to millions of people. I don't think they will,"" said Lorella Praeli, the advocacy director at immigrants' rights group United We Dream. ""I think they will try to couch that as 'these are our political constraints.'"" Political football . Whatever Obama finally decides -- and at this point, the options seem clear -- he'll be met with fierce blowback from Republicans on Capitol Hill, who have spent months preparing for the announcement by warning of executive overreach and political well-poisoning. The White House yielded to politics once already, delaying the immigration announcement from its promised debut this summer to a new date before the end of this year. The move was meant to shield vulnerable Democrats from political attacks on the topic; many of them lost their races anyway. The postponement wasn't met kindly from immigration groups, who said there wasn't time to spare on providing deportation relief for the millions of people who could be affected by new rules. This time the White House seems intent to get the announcement done before the New Year. Obama vowed action during a post-election press conference last week and Josh Earnest, his press secretary, reiterated the end-of-year goal during a press conference in Burma Thursday. There could still be election year ramifications, since Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu remains locked in a runoff contest with a Republican rival. But with the Senate firmly in Republican hands, any further delay would seem to offer little political advantage while only eroding support further among immigration reform activists. ""For us, every day that there's a delay, and every day that people have to wait, means more people unjustly deported,"" said Praeli. Some Democrats want Obama to wait to announce the executive action after essential business clears the House and Senate. Sen. Harry Reid, the outgoing Senate Majority Leader, told CNN the president should hold off any immigration action until a new bill funding the federal government is approved. He said enacting the immigration plan ahead of the spending measure could anger Republicans and risk a government shutdown. ""I'd like to get the finances of this country out of the way before he does it. But it's up to him,"" Reid said. But no matter when the action comes, it seems destined to ignite GOP furor. The near certainty of an executive action by year's end hasn't slowed Republican efforts to stop it: this week a Republican congressman from Texas, Rep. Joe Barton, said if Obama goes forward with the plan, impeachment proceedings could be a possibility. Those threats aren't exactly a new thing. Democrats have raised millions of dollars by warning their party's base about impeachment threats from conservative House members. More real is the threat that taking executive action on immigration forestalls any legislative effort on the matter. GOP leaders on Capitol Hill say a new plan delaying deportations would enrage Republicans, leaving little political will to push through a comprehensive overhaul of the immigration system. Obama seems little concerned by Republican threats against making the immigration move, however, pointing out they had an opportunity to pass a bipartisan reform measure in the House but balked. ""I feel obliged to do everything I can lawfully with my executive authority to make sure that we don't keep on making the system worse,"" he said during last week's news conference.","Obama has pledged to act on immigration before the end of the year .
Precise timing is unclear ."
"Tony Bosch, the founder of the now-defunct Biogenesis anti-aging clinic in Miami, is not a licensed doctor, but portrayed himself as one, federal officials said Tuesday. Officials said he dispensed performance-enhancing drugs to professional baseball players such as suspended New York Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez and to impressionable high school athletes in South Florida and teenagers in the Dominican Republic. Bosch, 50, surrendered to the Drug Enforcement Administration in Florida on Tuesday. At a court appearance, he pleaded not guilty and a judge set bail at $100,000. Federal officials said earlier Tuesday that Bosch would agree to plead guilty to a charge of distributing steroids in a conspiracy that stretched from big league club houses to South Florida high schools and youth baseball leagues to sandlots in the Caribbean. One of his attorneys, Susy Ribero-Ayala, said there is a plea agreement in place and Bosch will change his plea later. ""Mr. Bosch has never had and does not have a DEA registration,"" said Mark Trouville, special agent in charge of the DEA Miami. ""He is not a licensed medical professional. He is not a doctor. He is a drug dealer."" Also charged in the scandal were Yuri Sucart, a cousin of Rodriguez, and Juan Carlos Nunez, who was named in a scheme to clear All-Star Melky Cabrera after a positive 2012 testosterone test, authorities said. Other defendants include Carlos Acevedo, a longtime associate of Bosch's, former University of Miami coach Lazaro ""Lazer"" Collazo, Jorge Velasquez, and Christopher Engroba. Acevedo and three other men, including CarlosLuis Ruiz, a Florida Highway Patrol trooper, also were charged in a separate conspiracy involving the sale of  the drug MDMA, or molly. Eight of the 10 men charged appeared in court. Acevedo and Engroba also entered not guilty pleas. The other men didn't enter a plea. Lengthy investigation . The drug conspiracy charges against the men stemmed from from a 21-month DEA investigation. ""These defendants were motivated by one thing: money,"" United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, Wifredo Ferrer, said. ""They did this by lining their pockets, by exploiting the pressures of athletes and others to be bigger, to be stronger and to play better."" Bosch could face a 10-year prison term in the case. Bosch told investigators that he provided the illegal substances to at least 18 minors, Ferrer said. Bosch and his associates distributed the drugs to minors who attended a number of public and private high schools in South Florida. He would charge the teenagers and their parents between $250 and $600 a month, promising that the concoctions -- which included black market steroids -- would improve their game. A look at performance enhancing drugs in sports . In addition, investigators said, Bosch and the others operated in the Dominican Republic, where boys as young as 12 were given new baseball equipment and treated with testosterone-loaded syringes in an effort to get them signed with big league teams. Talents scouts working with the children would keep as much as 50 % of their signing bonuses. ""These defendants provided easy access to dangerous concoctions of steroids and human growth hormones to impressionable high school kids,"" Ferrer said. ""Simply put: Doping children is unacceptable. It is wrong. It is illegal and it is dangerous and Bosch and his reckless recruiters and his black market suppliers ignored the serious health risks posed to their so called patients, all to make a profit."" Using lollipops . The drugs were administered in a number of ways, through injections, pills, creams and even lollipops, according to a source with direct knowledge of the investigation. Masking agents were used to hide the drugs. ""It was so good. The key was being able to fool  testers with the league (Major League Baseball), the source said. ""The masking agents in the creams would hide the actual drug, and (Bosch) would know the timing involved. He knew if the athlete took the drug right before a game, they'd be tested 12 hours later and the drug would no longer be detectable."" Earlier this year, Major League Baseball dropped its lawsuit against Bosch and the company the league claims provided performance-enhancing drugs to a number of players, including Rodriguez. The league had agreed to drop the suit if Bosch cooperated in the investigation, according to published reports. In a statement Tuesday, Rodriguez's lawyer, Joe Tacopina, said: ""This obviously is the beginning of the end of this sordid chapter in baseball."" Authorities said professional athletes recruited by the clinic paid between $2,000 and $12,000 per month for the drugs. The investigation led to the suspension of 14 players for violating the league's drug policy. Besides Rodriguez, suspended players included Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun, the 2011 National League MVP, who served part of his suspension last season. Bosch's Biogenesis clinic became part of the story in late January 2013, when the Miami New Times reported that more than a dozen professional baseball players and other athletes had been named in records kept over several years by the clinic. Two months later, MLB filed its lawsuit against the clinic in Florida's Miami-Dade County. Its 14-page complaint named Biogenesis, its predecessor company and six individuals -- among them program director Bosch, others at the company, someone who worked at a sports agency, a former University of Miami baseball player and a ""self-proclaimed chemist"" who supplied substances.

"Clinical trials of experimental Ebola treatment will start next month in West Africa as the regional death toll from the deadly virus surpasses 5,000. Doctors Without Borders will conduct trials at three treatment centers in Guinea and Liberia, the medical aid agency announced Thursday. One trial will treat infected patients with the antiviral drug brincidofovir at a medical center in the Liberian capital of  Monrovia. In a second trial, patients will get the antiviral drug Favipiravir in the southern town of Gueckedou in Guinea. A  third trial in the Guinean capital of Conakry will focus on giving patients blood transfusions from Ebola survivors, a method recommended by the World Health Organization. There is currently no cure or vaccine for Ebola, which has killed thousands in  Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone -- the three nations most affected. Clinical trials led by three research groups will focus on finding an effective therapy against the disease. ""This is an unprecedented international partnership which represents hope for patients to finally get a real treatment against a disease that today kills between 50 and 80% of those infected,"" said Dr. Annick Antierens of Doctors Without Borders. First trial . While the use of brincidofovir will be a first for Liberia, this is not the first time the drug has been used to fight the virus. The first Ebola patient in  the United States, Thomas Eric Duncan, got brincidofovir at Texas Health Presbyterian, where he was treated after arrival from Liberia in September. He died last month. NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo, who contracted the virus in Liberia and was airlifted to the United States for treatment, got the drug as well. He was discharged from a Nebraska hospital last month. Second trial . In Guinea, patients will get the same treatment given to Spanish nurse's aide Teresa Romero Ramos, who took Favipiravir . She survived. Blood transfusions . In the Guinean capital, patients will get transfusions from survivors. Blood from survivors, referred to as convalescent serum, is said to have antibodies that can fight the deadly virus. Though unproven, the treatment has provided some promise. ""Studies suggest blood transfusions from survivors might prevent or treat Ebola virus infection in others, but the results of the studies are still difficult to interpret,"" the WHO said. ""It is not known whether antibodies in the plasma of survivors are sufficient to treat or prevent the disease. More research is needed."" Convalescent serum was used to treat  American aid worker Rick Sacra, who was hospitalized in Omaha and got blood from Kent Brantly, a fellow American who survived Ebola. Both got infected when they were helping patients in Liberia. Fears of an outbreak in Mali . The tests come amid fears that Mali has not combated the deadly virus.  Four people have died of Ebola in Mali, the WHO said. A nurse died at a hospital in the Malian capital of Bamako, the health ministry said Wednesday.  The first victim, a 2-year-old girl, died last month. The nation was optimistic it had beaten the virus, but the new fatalities have raised fears of another outbreak.

"(CNN) -- Fifty years ago this month, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy numbed the world. But as the front pages of history were being printed, there was one scoop slipping by virtually unnoticed: the western hemisphere was witnessing a youthquake. Only weeks earlier, ""Beatlemania"" was born, when thousands of screaming girls at London Heathrow greeted a young boy-band home from a short tour of Sweden. Passing through the airport was stalwart American TV host Ed Sullivan who, on seeing the hysterical adulation offered up to four mop-topped boys, decided to have them on his show. Whether anyone was aware of it at the time, the youth revolution was underway. It had been gathering momentum all through 1963 -- pied pipers with guitars inspired young people to seize the day, to reject the lives led by their parents, and create their own music, fashion and culture. Times they were a-changing . The Beatles went from relative obscurity at the start of 1963 to performing in front of 73 million Americans -- nearly a third of the population -- on the Ed Sullivan Show at the beginning of 1964. Pop groups -- most still fresh from school -- were suddenly being invited to the likes of Buckingham Palace and the White House. President Lyndon B. Johnson had one band, The Dave Clark Five, frogmarched up the steps of Air Force One -- so he could get their autographs. A generation that had been tolerated became a generation to be wooed. Their stage had been built; 1963 was the opening night -- and so radical was their new path, such a break from the past, that they'd no sense of what was waiting for them. ""We would sit in a club, me, the Stones, the Beatles, the models -- and we'd talk about how it would only last a couple of years and then we'd have to get jobs like our parents,"" recalls Terry O'Neill, the celebrated British photographer who chronicled the sweeping changes in London in 1963. ""Ringo was going to be a hairdresser, Mick Jagger thought he'd have to work in a bank. The models just thought they'd let their hair down before they found a husband or got a proper job as a secretary. ""But suddenly, in that one year we realized, the lives we were living weren't just a rite of passage. We could be anything we wanted to be. Nobody was going to stop us. None of us were trained. Eric, Keith, Paul and John, none of them could read a note of music. I picked up a camera. I had no idea what I was doing. But nobody told us we couldn't. That, says O'Neill, is what was truly special about 1963. ""We could be whatever we wanted to be, whatever we wanted to say we were."" A hard day's night . Speaking to me in his last interview weeks before his death last year, legendary hairdresser Vidal Sassoon put the sense of youthful irreverence and creativity that would define an era into context. ""After the war, Britain was broke, we were broke, [so this meant] the kids were brought up in an extraordinary mood of rebuilding and rebelliousness,"" he said. Sassoon, a working-class boy from London's East End, had focused his ambition to be a hairdresser and moved upmarket into London's mega-posh Mayfair. While his salon had served the aristocracy and the wives of rich and powerful men, Sassoon -- in the spirit of the age -- resisted establishment conventions and created a stark, geometric statement of youthful independence: The wedge bob cut. ""I walked past his salon one day and saw this photograph of a haircut. It was the five point bob,"" says Mary Quant -- who would herself service the burgeoning cult of youth by severing 12 inches off a hem, thereby inventing the minidress. ""I wanted to look like that model. Everyone I knew wanted to look like that model."" In a recording studio in Manhattan, Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards says that the youth of 1963 changed the world ""with guitars, patterns, scissors, paint brushes, cameras, and mold-breaking, often naÃ¯ve ideas. Time is on my side . ""For years we'd been told, 'you'll go into the army, that'll sort you out'. Then suddenly we didn't have to go into the army,"" Richards says. The post-war draft had ended in Britain and was being scaled down in the United States. Young people had grown up expecting to do three years of military service and then, out of nowhere, ""we had those years back,"" says Richards. All that newly discovered free time led to a burst of expression that was, at times, shocking. That year, a young Andy Warhol moved into a fire- house on New York's East Eighty-seventh Street to stretch the boundaries of the art world, and a young David Hockney invented his own palette. A clothing company called Levi's recognized a trend and launched its pre-shrunk jeans; Timothy Leary was fired by Harvard and began his Millbrook experiment; the Monterey and Newport folk festivals created a new template for the mass celebration of youth. And it wasn't just the prosperity and the freedom to explore new music and wear new fashions to dance and parade in: The contraceptive pill became widely available to young women, liberating them from fear of unwanted and adolescence-curtailing pregnancy. In that one year, nobodies made names for themselves that would span half a century, and whose contribution to art and culture will continue to span centuries to come. It's thanks to Jagger, Dylan and the Beatles; to Quant, Sassoon; and to the countless other fashion mavens, musicians and artists who emerged that year that 18-year-olds today command the attention of politicians and Wall Street. Before 1963, youth was largely acquiescent and acquisitive. After 1963, they were impossible to ignore. They were catered to. They were marketed to. They were listened to. They were heard.","1963 was the most important year for art and culture, argues author Robin Morgan .
Amid political turmoil was the birth of a 'global demographic power shift'
Likes of Beatles, Rolling Stones, Andy Warhol and Vidal Sassoon signaled first rise of youth ."
"Nevada Democratic Sen. Harry Reid will lose his slot as majority leader once the GOP takes control of the Senate next year. But his Nevada counterpart in the Senate, Republican Dean Heller, is reportedly working to unseat Reid altogether in 2016. Heller said he ""of course"" reached out to Nevada GOP Gov. Brian Sandoval to run to unseat Reid in 2016, according to a report out Wednesday from the Las Vegas Review Journal. Sandoval, the first Hispanic man elected to statewide office in his state, handily won his gubernatorial bid with more than 70 percent of the vote earlier this month. Sandoval told the Las Vegas Sun this week that he is committed to serving out his term as governor, counting himself out for a move to Washington in two years if he sticks to his word. ""I think he'll want to assess, and we'll give him a little time to do that,"" Heller said. ""There are plenty of people I'm sure could play in that race."" Reid, a Senator since 1987, has already signaled his intentions to run for reelection in 2016. But he faces an uphill battle similar to the competitive race for his last re-election in 2010. Unseating him -- a long-time Democratic fixture in Congress considered a lightning rod figure by some on the right -- could be a symbolic victory for conservatives looking to maintain their new Senate majority beyond 2016. ""Senator Reid and Senator Heller have known each other for a long time,"" Reid's spokeswoman Kristen Orthman said in a statement to the Review-Journal. ""Working together, they are able to do good things for Nevada and that is our top priority."" Reid's office did not immediately return CNN's request for comment. Heller lost his bid Thursday to become chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, a group which works to promote and elect GOP senators. Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi will replace outgoing NRSC chairman Rob Portman of Ohio. The position was viewed as a critical one for Heller: It would have increased his authority in the Senate leading into the 2016 elections, giving him authority to recruit candidates like Sandoval and actively fundraise for them.","Nevada GOP Sen.

"A surgeon infected with Ebola will be transported from Sierra Leone to The Nebraska Medical Center for treatment, a U.S. government official familiar with the situation said. The doctor, a Sierra Leone national and legal permanent resident of the United States, is expected to arrive this weekend, most likely Saturday, the official said. The official said it's not known whether the doctor was working in an Ebola treatment unit or some other type of hospital. The surgeon is married to a U.S. citizen and has children, the official said. Sierra Leone has seen more than 5,300 cases of Ebola and more than 1,100 deaths in this year's outbreak of the deadly virus, according to figures from the World Health Organization. The Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha is one of four hospitals in the United States that have biocontainment units and years of preparation in handling highly infectious disease such as Ebola. In a statement Thursday night, a spokesman said the hospital is still awaiting official confirmation about whether it will treat another Ebola patient. First, hospital spokesman Taylor Wilson said, air ambulance crew members will evaluate the patient when they arrive in Sierra Leone. ""The members of the crew will determine whether the patient is stable enough for transport -- if he is, he would arrive in Omaha sometime Saturday afternoon,"" Wilson said in a written statement. ""We will update you on the status of this patient as more information becomes available."" Doctors at The Nebraska Medical Center have already treated two American Ebola patients. Dr. Rick Sacra was treated at the hospital and released in September. Ashoka Mukpo, a freelance cameraman who worked for NBC, was treated there and released last month. Sacra and Mukpo contracted the virus in Liberia and were later flown to the United States for treatment. So far, the limited number of Ebola cases treated in the United States have shown a higher survival rate than cases treated in West Africa. A number of factors could impact the latest patient's treatment, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta told ""AC360."" ""We don't know how sick he is,"" Gupta said.

"The British businessman accused of ordering a hit on his new wife while on honeymoon in South Africa will appear in a Cape Town court on Tuesday. Shrien Dewani was returned to the country Monday by UK officials. He denies murdering Anni Dewani, 28, in November 2010 in Cape Town. He has avoided extradition for the past three years on mental health grounds, but  upon losing his latest appeal, British authorities have agreed to return him to South Africa to stand trial. The extradition request was approved on the proviso that if Dewani was not fit to stand trial in the next 18 months, he will be returned to the United Kingdom. Dewani left from Bristol Airport Monday night, according to a statement issued by London's Metropolitan Police, and is set to arrive in South Africa on Tuesday morning, local time. He is accompanied by ""representatives from the South African authorities,"" and will be taken directly to court to be formally charged when he lands. The court is due to sit at 11:30 am (local time), a few hours after he lands. Dewani, a millionaire care home owner, is accused of hiring a crew of hitmen to kill his wife during a taxi ride in Cape Town in November 2010, just over two weeks after their wedding. Taxi driver Zola Tongo confessed within weeks of the bride's death that he had hired two men to kill her. In a plea deal with South African authorities, he said he was paid by Dewani to carry out the hit and to make it look as though the two were the victims of a carjacking as they were driving through a township on the edge of Cape Town. Tongo was subsequently sentenced to 18 years in prison for his part in the killing. His two accomplices are also serving lengthy sentences for their part in the killing. In their ruling, the judges at the High Court in London said there was some prospect that Dewani could recover sufficiently to be fit to stand trial. He has been apparently suffering from mental health conditions, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Until his extradition, he had been held at Fromeside Hospital, a secure mental health unit in Bristol. Upon arrival in South Africa, he is likely to be transferred to the bleak, prison-like Valkenberg hospital, a high security psychiatric facility in Cape Town. The family of the victim has welcomed the ruling. Speaking at a news conference, her brother, Anish Hindocha said, ""It's been very difficult. There is no life in our family any more, we struggle very much. With the help of the South African people, with the help of the British people, we are at least trying to cope... we need justice for Anni""","Murder suspect Shrien Dewani extradited from UK to face trial in South Africa .

"According to a recent book, there are 100 things to do in New York City before you die. We've collected 12 of them here. All are located in Manhattan, unless noted. Sing karaoke at Arlene's Grocery . You can't play a guitar like Jimi, you can't sing like Freddie and yet you dream of being a rock star like Bowie. Especially when you've been drinking. Sound familiar? Since 1996, this former bodega has been one of the primo showcases for local bands in NYC, and on Monday and Friday nights, their famous karaoke band gives accountants, baristas and repressed librarians a taste of the limelight. Even if you don't have it in you to take the stage, the drinks are cheap and the people watching ranges from ""wow"" to ""that's hilarious"" to ""what a train wreck."" But no matter the level of talent, the entertainment factor goes to 11. Arlene's Grocery, 95 Stanton St.; +1 212 358 1633 . Walk the High Line . Considered this generation's Central Park, the 1.45 miles of reclaimed railroad track is testament to community activism and urban beautification efforts. Initially slated for demolition in 1999 until downtowners Joshua David and Robert Hammond started Friends of the High Line, the park now hosts more than 4.4 million visitors annually, which has actually become a problem. The path is only 30 feet wide in some places, causing a pleasant stroll to sometimes feel like waiting in line. So visit early in the morning or late in the evening, and avoid weekends at all cost. The High Line runs from Gansevoort Street to West 30th Street; +1 212 500 6035 . Get a ticket at Katz's Delicatessen . Ever wonder what pastrami is, exactly? It's beef brisket cured in brine and covered with a mix of spices that include garlic, paprika and mustard seed. Then it's steamed until the meat begins to break down. The process was a way of preserving meat before the age of refrigeration. Today, there are only three NYC delis to get a traditional pastrami sandwich: Carnegie Deli, 2nd Avenue Deli and Katz's Delicatessen. Each of these granddaddies have their share of history and old-timey charm, but Katz's undoubtedly delivers the best experience. Upon entering, you're given a ticket (which you better not lose!), and then you proceed to the counter to order (your ticket will get marked depending on what you order). If you're a traditionalist, you'll want pastrami on rye with mustard and a cup of matzo ball soup. A mound of pickles is thrown in for free. After taking that last delicious bite, take a stroll around the place to look at all the photos on the wall, and see if you can find the table where that scene from ""When Harry Met Sally"" was filmed. P.S. It's open late! Katz's Delicatessen, 205 E. Houston St; +1 212 254 2246 . Watch some noir at Film Forum . There are several good independent movie theaters in New York, but the Forum stands alone as cinema's obsessive historian. The atmosphere of the theater itself somehow matches the mood of the carefully curated celluloid that lights up the big screen nightly. International noir from Jean-Luc Godard and classics by Orson Welles are house specialties, but so are little known gems like ""Scarecrow"" (starring Gene Hackman) and ""Public Enemy"" (which made Jimmy Cagney a star).

All those poor, tired, huddled masses would have headed straight back to the Old Country if they had to endure the lines that typically greet the patriots and tourists looking to visit Liberty Island. The best way to see America's First Lady is to take the Circle Line Sightseeing cruise, which departs from Pier 83, down the Hudson River. It passes this close by Lady Liberty before heading under the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges. (There are lots of Circle Line cruise options, so make sure you choose the right one. And a good alternative is a ride on the Staten Island Ferry, which gets pretty close to Lady Liberty, runs regularly and is free.) Circle Line Sightseeing, Pier 83, W. 42nd St.; +1 212 563 3200 . Rock out at the Bowery Ballroom . Ever hear of The Go! Team? How about Joan Baez or Soul Asylum? If not, then chances are you're not cool. Don't worry, though! A quick fix is only a gig away at this tiny concert venue where bands from all over the world come to jam. The bar upstairs is a great place to amp up with friends before heading downstairs to get electrified by music not meant to be consumed by mass-market audiences. Obviously you should do some homework and see a band that interests you, but any night rocking out at the Ballroom will be a night to remember. Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey St.+1 212 533 2111 . Explore the northwest area of Central Park . Ask any New Yorker for a short list of must-sees in Central Park and they'll likely rattle off destinations like Strawberry Fields and Bethesda Fountain.

The area has a distinct topography (complete with waterfall), making it a favorite among naturalists and joggers alike. Central Park; +1 212 310 6600 . Visit the National September 11 Memorial & Museum . Considering the unspeakable depravity that led to the creation of ""ground zero,"" the feeling of reverence, endurance, perseverance and peace that now greets visitors is truly astounding. More than 11 million people have come here from all over the world since it opened in 2011, and in so doing, paid tribute to the indomitable human spirit. The site is solemn, but it's also a place of wonder and learning, with the considerable effort of those who designed and built the memorial evident at every turn. The two massive reflecting pools that cascade water down into the footprints of the two felled towers are equal parts moving and beautiful. Bronze panels surrounding the pools bear the names of everyone who died in the attacks, and are arranged with delicate significance. The museum, located seven stories underground at the base of the original Twin Towers, curates a powerful and extensive exhibit that includes crushed fire trucks, salvaged steel tridents that once held up the towers, photographs and biographies of all those who perished in the attacks, including those of the terrorists, lest the world forgets who was responsible. National September 11 Memorial & Museum, Liberty Street; +1 212, 312 8800 . Listen to live jazz in Greenwich Village . What, you think John Coltrane is really dead? There are three known cures for jazz know-nothings in NYC: Smalls, the Village Vanguard and the Blue Note. The latter two venues have been around for the better part of a century, but all three attract the very best talent and have atmospheres that make for one of those late nights to remember. Go alone or with a pal, and hear firsthand the city's one true soundtrack. Smalls, 183 W. 10th St.; +1 212 252 5091 . Village Vanguard, 178 7th Ave.; +1 212 255 4037 .

New York is lousy with esoteric museums -- what, you've never heard of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World on East 84th Street? -- but it's a different story inside the baroque colossus that occupies the east frontage of Central Park between 82nd and 83rd streets. Its famed treasures are too numerous to list here, but with an operating budget of more than $250 million a year, it's the only museum in the world that rivals Paris' Louvre. Properly exploring the museum in one day is impossible, but arrive early and consider opting for the amazingly insightful audio tour.

If you're not from New York -- and even if you are -- there's a good chance you're not a fan of baseball's greatest-ever team. Nevertheless, a trip to Yankee Stadium should come before a trip to Cooperstown [location of the National Baseball Hall of Fame] for any lover of America's national pastime. Regular stadium seating tickets range from $100 all the way up to a ridiculous $200, though the $78 for the bleacher is a good option if you don't mind being cut off in the 5th inning (concession stands everywhere else serve until the 7th inning) and have a tolerance for vulgar chants.

"A suicide bomber blew himself up at an entrance to Afghanistan's Bagram Airfield on Monday, an attack the Taliban called revenge for the burning of Qurans by U.S. troops there last month. The blast at the base, north of Kabul, killed two civilians and wounded two others, Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Seddiqi said. A Taliban spokesman claimed 12 U.S. soldiers, including Special Forces members, and nine Afghans were killed in the blast, part of the group's ""revenge campaign"" for the Quran burning. An Afghan official, however, said two personnel from the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan were wounded, and a spokesman for the mission, the International Security Assistance Force, said initial reports suggested no ISAF casualties. The Taliban frequently exaggerate battlefield losses inflicted on ISAF personnel and have been accused of causing 75% of civilian casualties in the country. News of the Qurans being burned sparked protests and attacks that have left at least 40 people dead, including four American soldiers, and hundreds more wounded. U.S. officials have called the Quran burning an error by troops who were inadvertently given the Qurans and other religious materials to dispose of because they were thought to contain extremist inscriptions. U.S. President Barack Obama has apologized for the burning to his Afghan counterpart, Hamid Karzai.","A suicide bomber blew himself up at a checkpoint to Bagram Airfield .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- In the 2011 suspense movie ""Contagion,"" Gwyneth Paltrow's globe-trotting character dies from a virus that stirred up our memories -- and fears -- of SARS, the respiratory epidemic from China that killed several hundred people around the world in 2003. Paltrow played Patient Zero, a woman who travels through Hong Kong -- where we were treated to scenes of Kowloon, by some accounts the densest concentration of human life on the planet -- from where she boards a plane and subsequently spreads the deadly virus around the world. While the movie was fiction, SARS was very real. It made us feel nervous, vulnerable and afraid. But it also made us learn. Exactly one decade after SARS hit, is the travel world ready if a similar epidemic -- a SARS 2.0 -- were to break out? Experts in the aviation, hotel and health industries agree we're now much better prepared than before to deal with such a potential calamity. But some still prefer to avoid publicly addressing the issue. Here are five of the most important lessons we've learned about handling global epidemics, ten years on. 1. SARS helped the world realize we needed a global plan . ""The most important change has been the adoption of the International Health Regulations in 2005,"" says Dr. Isabelle Nuttall, World Health Organization Director for the Global Capacities Alert and Response Department in Geneva, Switzerland. The IHR, as Nuttall describes, is basically one massive global plan that maps an emergency response effort if a health emergency -- such as SARS -- strikes. At present, 194 states and territories have signed the legally binding agreement. Ten years ago, a plan like this simply didn't exist. ""During SARS everything had to be invented,"" says Nuttall. ""It was the first time we were dealing with such a disease, such an international threat. We had to mount new networks of clinicians and laboratories."" And there was no obligation to report anything quickly -- as the world learned from a secretive China in April 2003. On one Saturday that month, health authorities in Beijing claimed just 37 confirmed SARS cases existed in the capital. One day later, Beijing revealed 346 confirmed cases with another 402 suspected. The international community condemned China for withholding vital information. Ten years later, the IHR now gives the World Health Organization ""probing powers"" into any signatory country to check in and make sure everything is okay. Countries are legally bound to report all they know. 2. SARS helped us be more alert with technology and training . While NORAD, North American Aerospace Defense Command, tracks airspace over the United States and Canada for potential threats, the World Health Organization boasts its own global watch system for brewing health crises. Like a global plan, the capability for high-tech tracking also didn't exist ten years ago. ""We now have a system that is constantly screening the web 24/7 for information and rumors,"" says the WHO's Nuttal. ""We analyze them -- and some turn out to be false. However, every single piece of information is touching our attention and bringing the information to a team of people."" While the World Health Organization has an army of 8,000 health and safety officials, the Kowloon Shangri-La in Hong Kong has an 800-person trained team of employees that both welcome and watch hotel guests. ""We always want to be alert, but we certainly don't want to be alarming,"" says Linda Wan, resident manager at the Kowloon Shangri-La. The 20-year industry veteran, who moved from the United States to Hong Kong last year, has an old 2003 emergency SARS manual sitting on her desk. That has evolved into a general emergency response manual that the Shangri-La uses to train staff. Employees are taught to sanitize public areas -- elevator buttons, escalator rails, door knobs and restroom doors -- every hour or based on foot traffic frequency. In guest rooms, housekeeping disinfects frequently touched items with special focus on remote controls, light switches and bathrooms. ""If a guest is ill we may refer them to a nearby clinic and notify proper authorities of any heightened concern,"" says Wan. Even before hotel guests check in, thermal imaging technology at major airports serves as an earlier field of defense against visitors arriving with a fever. The closer your image is to the red side of the visible light spectrum, the warmer you are. Too warm and you get a visit to the quarantine room for questioning and a potential sick bed. 3. SARS taught us to appreciate breathing in deeply . You board your plane, amble down the aisle, spot your seat and then ... mentally cringe: your red-nosed neighbor for the next several hours is coughing and sneezing into already-moist tissues. If air purity is a factor in which airplane you fly, the Boeing Dreamliner (battery problems notwithstanding) is best, according to Tom Ballantyne, the Sydney-based chief correspondent for Orient Aviation. The two-decade aviation expert says the Dreamliner's technologically advanced systems mean its air is the best-filtered in the skies. Another benefit of the state of the art system is a difference in cabin pressure. While other airplanes are pressurized at about 8,000 feet in altitude, the new Dreamliners are pressurized at 5,000 feet, ""so it's a much more pleasant atmosphere."" Higher humidity levels also keep that dry cottonmouth feeling at bay. The newer Boeing 777's and the latest versions of the Airbus A350 and A320 Neo also have well filtered air, adds Ballantyne. ""As newer models come out, their internal air purification systems are more advanced."" But the 747-400 sits on the opposite end of the clean air spectrum because it's ""a relatively elderly aircraft"" that's been in operation for nearly three decades, says Ballantyne. While Singapore Airlines retired its last 747 passenger jet in April 2012, Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific still has 18 in its fleet, United Continental operates 23 and British Airways boasts to be ""the world's largest operator of the Boeing 747-400"" -- with 57 aircraft. 4. SARS taught airlines to be financially more resilient . Between 2001 and 2005, an average of more than one major U.S. airline filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection each year: TWA (2001), US Airways (2002) , United Airlines (2002) , US Airways again (2004) and both Northwest Airlines (2005) and Delta (2005) on the same day in a coincidence in timing. But from 2006 onward, just one major U.S. airline filed for bankruptcy protection -- American Airlines in 2011. The reason is that catastrophic events, such as 9/11 and SARS, taught airlines an important lesson. When people stopped flying, ""airlines recognized the thing that gets them into real trouble is running out of cash,"" says Paul Sheridan, head of consultancy Asia at Hong Kong-based Ascend. Airlines learned to ""make sure they have enough cash flow"" to weather turbulent times. ""Over the last five years, we've seen oil prices hit 150 bucks a barrel, swine flu and a volcanic ash cloud"" that all impacted air passenger numbers, says Sheridan. ""The industry has had plenty of practice and (now keeps) more cash on hand. It's a pretty wide range for liquidity, but perhaps it's 10 percent of revenue, maybe a bit higher."" If it hadn't been for 9/11 and SARS, ""a lot of airlines would have been bankrupt now if you threw the same issues over the last five years at them."" 5. SARS -- and other big, bad diseases -- still scare us . Sometimes what we learn isn't through what is said, but through what is not. Although SARS occurred a decade ago, an inordinate number of people and businesses declined comment for this article -- including all four international airports in the SARS hub cities of Hong Kong, Beijing, Singapore and Toronto. ""The responsible person has a very full schedule recently -- sorry,"" texted Hong Kong Airport Authority spokeswoman Chris Lam. ""This is something that we'd rather not revisit at this point in time,"" e-mailed Robin Goh, assistant vice president of corporate communications at Singapore's Changi Airport Group. Beijing Capital Airport authorities told CNN it would take ""several days to look at an application"" for an interview after having been closed the entire week prior for Chinese New Year. Toronto Pearson never replied to e-mailed interview requests. ""I don't know why (they would not talk) to tell you the truth,"" said Ballantyne of Orient Aviation. ""I could understand the trouble with Beijing and bureaucracy, but I would have expected Singapore and Hong Kong to be willing to talk about it. You fly to Singapore and you can still see the signs and huge thermal imaging cameras. I'd be happy to say 'We've got these things.'"" In the hotel industry, similar caution appeared to exist. Hong Kong's Kowloon Metropark (formerly the Metropole), the Hong Kong hotel that had the first reported SARS case in the city, declined an interview request. ""I'm sorry we do not want to put out any comments on the SARS issue because we want to look forward,"" said Anita Kwan, public relations manager at the Metropark Hotel in Kowloon. ""I have spoken to the boss."" The Hong Kong Four Seasons, arguably the city's top hotel, also declined to discuss any precautions and response procedures it had in place. ""Feburary is our peak season and we are too busy to arrange any interview at this moment,"" said Angela Wong, the Four Seasons public relations manager. And international airlines including Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific and Emirates Airlines all either stopped communicating, only released statements or declined interview requests through their public relations agency.

"(CNN) -- Thirty years ago Wednesday, Iranian student revolutionaries climbed over the walls of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and seized dozens of Americans, whom they ultimately held hostage for 444 days. The hostage crisis, coming in the aftermath of Iran's Islamic revolution, ended diplomatic relations between Washington and Tehran -- a rift that persists to this day. Iran celebrates the embassy takeover as an official holiday, and tens of thousands showed up in Tehran on Wednesday to hear anti-American speeches. The anniversary was also an opportunity to reignite the anti-government protests that were sparked in June, following a disputed presidential election, and thousands of anti-government protesters ignored warnings from Iranian authorities to stay home. One of the leaders of the 1979 hostage-takers says the United States and Iran must not be hostages to history. ""I am not willing to be a hostage of that historical event,"" Ebrahim Asgharzadeh said on CNN's ""Amanpour,"" in an interview marking the anniversary. ""Neither Iran nor the United States should be hijacked by that historical event,"" he said from Tehran, where he went on to become a reformist lawmaker and was himself jailed by the Islamic regime. He said the two sides need to be aware of the past without being imprisoned by it. ""If they do not pay attention to ... history they will have an unstable future, an impermanent future,"" he said. Asgharzadeh said he and his fellow students had been offended that Jimmy Carter, then the U.S. president, had let the deposed Shah of Iran into the United States for medical treatment -- and said the actions of his compatriots had parallels in the United States. ""We felt insulted -- our revolution, our people -- and so there was a rebellion,"" he said through a translator. ""A measure was needed to be taken that was effective, that could impact the world public opinion. ""We were not radical students. We were revolutionary students, in the sense that we were defending our country, our people, our nation,"" he said. ""What the students did for the first two or three days, it was a student activity. It was meant to protest, something that American students did many times on the streets to protest the Vietnam War."" But John Limbert, a former American hostage, is not convinced by the comparison. ""Whatever they thought they were doing, whether it was a 1970s-style student sit-in, the results of it were very ... different,"" he told Christiane Amanpour. And it was not the American hostages who suffered most, he added. ""They brought misery to the Iranian people. What happened to us was difficult. It was frightening. It was -- it was uncomfortable. But it lasted 14 months and was over,"" he said. ""We certainly didn't expect it to last that long. They have said they didn't expect [it] to last that long. But what they did, in effect, was to create a climate of lawlessness and mob rule [of which] they and their compatriots are today the greatest victims,"" said Limbert, the author of ""Negotiating with Iran, Wrestling the Ghost of History."" The hostage crisis escalated beyond what any of the participants expected as Iran's new revolutionary government publicly backed the hostage-takers, Asgharzadeh and former Carter aide Gary Sick agree. ""That way it became actually an act of the Iranian government, rather than a group of students who were acting potentially outside the law,"" said Sick, who was Carter's point man on Iran. ""So basically, the situation got out of hand, in terms of being a student activity,"" Asgharzadeh said. ""It became a societal issue backed by the leadership. ""And every day that passed on, things got more complicated. The analysis got more complicated in the White House. They lost their cool. They didn't know what to do. And they faced a challenge by the Iranian revolution and this revolutionary thought. And it reached a point where nobody felt prepared to deal with it,"" the former student revolutionary said. ""And so after a while, both America and Iran were looking for a solution, because both their hands were tied at that stage, but the solution needed to be such that no country would be seen as the loser,"" he said. That impasse still dominates the wary relationship between Tehran and Washington, Amanpour's guests said. But it is time to call in the Ghostbusters, Limbert said, referring to the popular movie that came out not long after the Americans were finally released. ""You know, they put the ghosts in the can and put the can away. And somehow ... you've got to do that,"" he said. ""You don't forget them. You don't necessarily even ask for an apology. But you look them in the face, you know them for what they are, which is a very ugly and negative act, and then you put them in their proper compartment,"" he advised. But Sick, now a Columbia University professor, said the hostage crisis continues to have ramifications in Washington today. ""The hostage crisis was extended probably eight months beyond what it should have been. No matter how you look at it in terms of Iran's interests or what have you, they simply couldn't make up their mind,"" he said of the regime in Tehran. ""And it has left the impression that, one, Iran can't be trusted; two, that when they negotiate, they negotiate in bad faith; and, three, that they are paying only attention to their own internal circumstances and ignoring everybody else. ""That is a legacy that we live with and even people who don't remember the hostage crisis at all still have that image of Iran that was created in those days that has not gone away,"" he said.","One hostage-taker says 1979 embassy takeover was protest by angry students .

"The Russian law that bans adoptions by U.S. families will take effect in one year instead of this month, Russia's semiofficial news agency RIA Novosti reported Thursday. In late December, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law a ban on the adoption of Russian children by U.S. families. It was supposed to take effect January 1. According to RIA Novosti, Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Thursday the adoption agreement between the two countries had not expired. ""The agreement is in force at the moment,"" he told the news agency. ""It will be in force over the course of the year."" The U.S. State Department said a termination clause in the agreement extends one year from the end of the agreement. ""So that would also take you to 2014,"" department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said.  ""We are very hopeful that we will be able to complete the cases of adoption that had been begun before the law was passed. So that's something that we will be working on with the Russian government."" Families 'in limbo' after Russian adoption ban . RIA Novosti said 46 such adoptions are under way. It was unclear whether any new cases would be approved. ""As you know, we have been seeking to have consultations with (the Russians) about the implementation of the law. So we will be inquiring of them how they see this,"" Nuland said. Americans adopted close to 1,000 Russian children last year, according to U.S. State Department figures. Though the number has been dropping in recent years, Russia remains the third most-popular foreign country -- after China and Ethiopia -- for U.S. foreign adoptions. The Russian measure also bars any political activities by nongovernmental organizations receiving funding from the United States if such activities could affect Russian interests, RIA Novosti said. It also imposes sanctions against U.S. officials thought to have violated human rights. The move is widely seen as retaliation for a bill that U.S. President Barack Obama signed into law on December 14. That law, called the Magnitsky Act, imposes U.S. travel and financial restrictions on human rights abusers in Russia. The Magnitsky Act is named for Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who uncovered the largest tax fraud in the country's history in the form of rebates claimed by government officials who stole money from the state. Magnitsky was apparently beaten to death in 2009 after a year in a Moscow detention center.

"(CNN) -- If there's only one African musician you've heard of, it's probably my father: Fela Kuti. His innovative musical style and flamboyant showmanship made him famous not just in Nigeria, but throughout the world as he pioneered what became known as Afrobeat. But Fela Kuti was more than a musician -- he was also a legendary activist, who with many other brave Africans was jailed for speaking out. One of the great injustices of our time is that some of the poorest people in the world are living on top of some of the Earth's richest resources of oil, gas and minerals. But rather than benefiting from this wealth, they're too often being robbed of it. In many African countries, the deals to extract these resources are done in the dark, with no information made available to citizens who deserve to know what their natural riches were sold for, and whether the money went to the national budget, or someone's Swiss bank account. As world leaders gather for the G20 summit in Brisbane, Australia, this weekend, it's time to draw a line in the sand over the corruption that wracks Africa. After all, you don't have to visit Lagos or Abuja to see the disparity between the haves and have-nots. Indeed, given revelations of government officials from some of Africa's poorest countries owning luxury homes in the United Kingdom, United States and France, it is clear we need strong international transparency laws to help ensure such assets aren't purchased with money stolen from public coffers. But this is no longer my father's fight. It's time for the next generation of activists to hold today's leaders accountable to their people. Corruption is not just an African problem; it's a global issue. In today's globalized world, where stolen money can be wired instantly from one country to another, we need global action to end corruption. After all, it takes two to tango. Although a corrupt official or business in Africa may be the one stealing money, those funds often end up in bank accounts and anonymous shell companies based in supposedly reputable financial centers like London, New York and Hong Kong. Take, for instance, the case of former Nigerian military dictator Sani Abacha. During his five-year reign in the 1990s, an estimated $3 billion to $5 billion of public money went missing. It is widely believed that much of that money ended up in bank accounts and shell companies in Europe and the United States. The Nigerian government has spent the past decade trying to find and recover it, with only modest success. With this in mind, we need to start by asking powerful countries to stop enabling the flow of ill-gotten spoils from developing nations to their shores. Rich nations must pull up the welcome mat to criminals and they have a great opportunity to do just that at the upcoming G20 summit. So what practical steps can the G20 take to crack down on corruption? First, they should require companies to publicize the names of their owners so that anonymous companies can no longer be used to steal the riches of developing countries. Second, they should endorse mandatory transparency laws for oil, gas and mining companies so citizens can follow the money and hold their governments accountable for the effective use of natural resource wealth. And finally, the G20 should lead on greater tax transparency for companies, making information publicly available that can be used to ensure that businesses pay their fair share of taxes to governments. We cannot lose sight of the impact of corruption on real human beings. According to The ONE Campaign, nearly $1 trillion each year is siphoned out of developing countries through shady deals and money laundering, with sizable amounts of that money ending up in the world's richest countries and offshore tax havens. This money could and should be used to build hospitals, schools, roads and infrastructure necessary to save and improve millions of peoples' lives. For decades, my father, and countless activists whose names history has forgotten, risked their lives to expose corruption and bring people to act, urging them to stand up for justice and human dignity. Now is the time for world leaders meeting in Australia to honor their legacy by tackling the problem of global corruption with smart, meaningful action.","Many of the poorest people live in resource-rich nations, says Femi Kuti .

"In America, summer holds a special place in our hearts: lazy afternoons, camping at the lake, warm evenings gazing at the moon. For children, especially, summer can unleash the free flow of discovery. For older children, summer often brings their first job. But this idyllic picture masks the reality that for too many children, particularly those from low-income families, languid summers can be educationally detrimental, and for families in which both parents work, summers are a logistical nightmare. Considerable research shows that the primary reason the achievement gap between poor children and their more affluent peers widens over the course of their school careers is the long break in learning over the summer. It's called summer slide. During the school year, disadvantaged children manage to catch up somewhat to more advantaged students. But during the summer, they lose those gains while their more advantaged peers -- whose parents can afford to arrange for summer enriching activities -- maintain theirs.  And a persistent achievement gap among children only leads to economic and social gaps that continue into adulthood. These gaps destabilize our society. Surely, eliminating the long summer break by making our school year longer, at least for schools serving poor neighborhoods, seems a ready solution to a problem that has enormously negative implications. An analysis of charter schools in New York by economist Caroline Hoxby revealed that students are most likely to outperform peers, both in traditional district schools and at other charters,  if they attend schools that are open at least 10 days more than the conventional year. Families with resources can often find educational summer programs and camps that broaden their children's skills and then figure out how to transport children to these activities. But even so, the question remains: Does it really make sense for children to be out of school for up to 12 weeks in the summer? Requiring students (and teachers, for that matter) to stay in school for more days is complicated and must overcome at least two significant obstacles. First, more days of school usually carries a price tag to cover costs of additional staff time, transportation and keeping buildings running. Second, although public attitudes are changing, overhauling such an ingrained institution as the long summer break won't be accomplished easily. The response to the first issue is to weigh the long-term costs of the summer break against the short-term costs of a longer school year. Balsz Elementary School District in Phoenix, for example, has extended its school year to 200 days, paying teachers 9% more to work the additional days. Since the longer year has been implemented, proficiency rates on state tests have risen, failure rates have fallen, and the achievement gap is disappearing. Clearly, the relatively small increase in budget yields large dividends for the students who attend. Students graduating middle school proficient in algebra and reading have opportunities open to them that are simply nonexistent for students at risk of  failure. Then consider the Brooklyn Generation School in New York, which has developed a model in which the students in grades nine through 12 attend for 200 days, but the teachers, on staggered schedules, are there for only 180. That means they earn salaries equal to their peers throughout the city. There is no shortage of innovation that can bring the benefits of a longer year to students. And what of the idea that summer should be a time of respite from the stresses of school? There are two wrong notions wrapped up in this perspective. The first is that somehow summer is automatically a magical time for children. Such may be the case for children from middle- and upper-class homes, but for those whose families can't afford camp or other activities, summer is often a time of emptiness and tedium. As one Balsz fifth-grader, happy to be back at school in August, declared, ""Sometimes summer is really boring. We just sit there and watch TV."" The second, more significant, misperception is that school is automatically bereft of the excitement and joy of learning. On the contrary, as the National Center on Time and Learning describes in its studies of schools that operate with significantly more time, educators use the longer days and years to enhance the content and methods of the classroom. It provides more openings for hands-on learning, student collaboration and inquiry-based learning, where students push themselves to learn. Why shouldn't children have these same opportunities during the summer as they do in cooler months? It is true that just having more time, whether it's more days during the year or more hours during the day, does not guarantee a superior education. Educators must use that extra time well and be committed to addressing individual students' needs and not waver in their drive for excellence. Yet, we do know that teachers who lack sufficient time with students, and students who spend too much time away from productive learning, are fighting an uphill battle in an environment where we hold increasingly high expectations for our children. There is no reason to scale back these expectations. Our future as a nation depends upon having a well-informed, highly skilled work force and citizenry. We should expect our schools to furnish today's students with the education they will need to excel in our global society. But we must also be willing to provide schools the tools they need to ensure this outcome, including the flexibility to turn the lazy days of summer into the season of learning.

"(CNN)  -- Maria Sharapova has been hit by a new injury setback and will be sidelined for up to six weeks, according to the Russian's tennis star's personal Web site. Sharapova aggravated an elbow injury as she lost to China's Zheng Jie in a marathon three-set match at the WTA event in Indian Wells. A later MRI scan revealed bone bruising to the elbow and she immediately pulled out of the prestigious tournament at Key Biscayne in Florida later this month. Sharapova told reporters that she had first felt the problem during last year's U.S. Open at Flushing Meadows, but really started to feel it in the deciding set against Zheng in a two hours 43 minute encounter. ""I just felt like I couldn't really extend it all the way. It was a little stuck. So it was going on for a while, but I thought it would be best to call the trainer,"" she said. The three-time grand slam champion has suffered a string of injuries, culminating in serious shoulder surgery in October 2008 which saw her sidelined for nearly 10 months. She has steadily clawed her way up the rankings and was 10th seed at Indian Wells, but her performances in grand slams have been disappointing and she went out in the first round of the Australian Open to fellow Russian Maria Kirilenko. Sharapova admitted to reporters after her defeat to Zheng that she would liked to have moved up the rankings faster, but was still proud of her efforts, which culminated in a 21st career title on the WTA Tour in Memphis last month. ""I mean, I think I'm doing a lot better than other people that have had shoulder surgery in their careers,"" she said. ""Some people have never come back. I don't know. What, I'm 13 in the world or something? That's a lot better than some of the girls I've lost to in the last year,"" she added. Off the court, Sharapova's appeal remains as strong as ever and in January she renewed her contract with Nike, signing an eight-year deal worth a reported $70 million.","Maria Sharapova faces between three to six weeks sidelined with elbow injury .

"Stop me if you've heard this one before. A TV series based on a comic book series premieres Friday. There have been a lot of them lately, from ""Gotham"" to ""The Flash"" (and of course the ratings juggernaut ""The Walking Dead""). They've done quite well this season: Both ""Gotham"" and ""Flash"" received full-season pickups. NBC's new offering, ""Constantine,"" is a riskier proposition. It's based on the story of cult character John Constantine, the chain-smoking exorcist antihero from the ""Hellblazer"" comic books. Keanu Reeves played him in a 2005 film version, which got a lukewarm reception. Even so, the show seems well-suited to NBC's Friday night horror lineup, following the sleeper hit ""Grimm."" CNN visited the Atlanta set of ""Constantine"" and spoke with Constantine himself, Matt Ryan, as well as his co-star Charlie Halford (who plays one of John's sidekicks, Chas), and later spoke to executive producer Daniel Cerone. The set itself included a cobweb-filled library that serves as John's base of operations. Watching a contortionist portray a demon-possessed woman seemed to be just another day at the office here. In between scenes, we asked their thoughts on whether the show had what it takes to be another comics-based hit. CNN: Do you think the hardcore fans will enjoy this series? Matt Ryan: I think the fans will get a lot out of this series. I hope they will. The source material is so amazing. We're really trying to stay true to that. We're transposing it to this medium of television. We're staying true to this character in the comics. The fans will hopefully come with us, and new fans will like the show as will. Daniel Cerone: The fans are very important to us. I'm fortunate enough to have as my partner David Goyer, who has brought comic books to life in films. We are fans of the property; it's a property that David loves and wanted to bring to screen. For us, it's a dream come true. It would never occur to us to be anything less than loyal to the fans. CNN: Do you understand why fans would be nervous? Charlie Halford: I totally understand that. I like to think that we're stepping up to the plate, at least with this show. The greatest compliment we can hope to receive is the blessing of die-hard ""Hellblazer"" fans. Everyone involved with the show have become relatively big fans of the comic book. You keep wanting to read one story then the next and the next. I asked the writers, what's the ""bible"" for this show? They said, ""It's the 'Hellblazer' comic."" I took great confidence in that. Ryan: A very good friend of mine has his own comic book company, and for years, he's been telling me about John Constantine being his favorite comic book character and ""Hellblazer"" his favorite book. Ever since I got the part, he keeps sending me emails: ""Why don't you do this storyline or that storyline?"" It's like I've got my own personalized fan who's feeding me all the great things about the character. I didn't know that much about it until I delved about the comics, and the more I'm reading, the more I'm loving. CNN: Compared with ""The Walking Dead,"" for example, how much of the show is directly from the comic? Halford: You've got 350 issues of a comic book that ran for almost 30 years. If we ever needed a storyline, they just go right back to the comic books. With some of these episodes we've been shooting recently, it's as though these characters walked right off the page. Hopefully, that resonates with the fans. Cerone: Our perceived story arc is based on his first appearance in ""Swamp Thing."" They were facing this menace called the ""rising darkness,"" a force trying to create this climate of fear across the world, to enable a large evil to be born into the world. That arc from ""Swamp Thing"" is exactly what we're bringing to ""Constantine."" Week to week, we have to find our own stories. Sometimes they're from the comics, sometimes not. Ryan: To be honest, I've tried to absorb the comics and let that influence me. You have to stay true to the essence of it, but you have to give it your take as well. The most important thing for me was, what is John about? It's just trying to find that and how I connect to that. There's bits of me in there as well and fleshing it out as well. Cerone: It's a little bit easier for us, since we're not a show about superheroes, and John Constantine doesn't have superpowers. In a way, we're more of a horror show than a comic-book show. For us, as a horror show, it might be easier than other straight comic-book adaptations. For us, the draw of the show was the character himself. John Constantine is a character we haven't seen on television. He isn't afraid to thumb his nose at any form of evil. He's just a really fun, inventive character. His costume is a trench coat and a skinny tie. He fits our reality. CNN: ""Hellblazer"" was definitely a book for mature audiences. What can you get away with at 10 p.m. on a Friday on network TV? Cerone: We're always trying to find that balance. To NBC's credit, more often than not, we'll turn in a script or a cut of an episode, and NBC will say, ""Take it further; make it more extreme."" They'll push us to make it darker. They understand the way people watch television, at least for this kind of show.

"Outgoing Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe is leaving office with a personal problem that has gone national: His decision to pardon his own son. Kyle Beebe was charged in 2003 with possession of a controlled substance (marijuana) and served three years probation and paid a fine. Critics have said the decision is proof that Beebe is abusing his power as he leaves the governor's mansion. The accusation, Beebe said, hurts him. ""Am I disappointed, of course. Does it hurt, sure. Would I have a tendencies to lash out, yes, I am human,"" said the two-term governor, a Democrat. ""But I acknowledge and accept that this is part of life and people will say what people will say."" The issue, Beebe made clear during an interview in his Little Rock office on Friday, is more than just a political one for him. ""On a personal note, I am embarrassed,"" Beebe said at his Little Rock office on Friday. ""And have been since 2003 when he got in trouble. His mother is embarrassed. The main thing is, he is embarrassed."" The Arkansas Parole Board recommended Kyle's pardon last month. It came after the now 34-year-old wrote a lengthy letter in his pardon application that for ""a second chance at life."" While some see the issue as an abuse of power, Beebe sees the issue more about fairness. According to his office, the governor has granted 717 pardons, most of which have been for young people with drug convictions. ""This one is being scrutinized for obvious reasons,"" Beebe said. ""But if I grant him the pardon, and I intend to when it ever reaches me desk, he will be treated just like everybody else in the same situation."" He added, ""I understand the scrutiny but it is not like he is inconsistent with what my policy has been for eight years."" It was clear, too, that Beebe feels slight guilt for the fact that his son's drug trouble has become a national news story. ""He is under a bigger microscope than others similarly situated. Through no fault of his own, he just happened to be my son,"" Beebe said. ""He is under a bigger microscope and it is my fault, not his fault. If I wasn't governor, he wouldn't be under a bigger microscope."" Beebe, though, will be leaving that microscopic scrutiny in months. He is term-limited and his choice to succeed him, Mike Ross, lost his race for governor to Republican Asa Hutchinson. Beebe swore on Friday that his time in politics is over, and despite this being one of the last aspects of his legacy, it does not leave him feeling burned. ""When you are in this seat, when you are in this office, the awareness is heightened, everything you do is heightened, everything that affects you is heightened,"" Beebe said. ""But that is part of it. That is the risk you take. You hate it for your family because your family gets pulled into it. But it is life.""","Mike Beebe says his son ""will be treated just like everybody else in the same situation""

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama has taken a lot of flak lately, some of which has been deserved. But there is one issue that history is likely to show that he deserves major props for innovation and courage -- climate change. Indeed, the deal concluded with China this week marks another example in which the President has bucked conventional wisdom, attacks from the climate deniers, and even lukewarm support from parts of his own party scared to be honest about the impact of fossil fuels or to come up with creative solutions to the challenges posed by climate change. Let's start with innovation. The clichÃ© that necessity is the mother of invention is clearly appropriate here. Domestically, despite foot-dragging and overt hostility from the Congress -- soon to get worse with the elevation of Sen. James Inhofe to chair the Senate Environment Committee -- Obama has doggedly used his executive and rule-making powers to put the country on the path toward a lower carbon future. Perhaps he has been inspired by how another president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, had to use smaller scale action like lend-lease to prepare for war, in the face of virulent opposition. But a global problem also requires international agreements, which is why -- rather than wait for the nearly 200 parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to come to agreement on a huge basket of climate-related issues -- the President is right in finding ways to work with other major greenhouse gas emitters. He hasn't given up on the UNFCCC process, but he is trying more than that. The reality is that climate negotiations have long been stalled, lost in a Groundhog Day cycle of yearly meetings ending in plans for more meetings. It's a top-down model for negotiations whose effectiveness was put in doubt by reports years ago, and one that ignores the unimpressive success rate of the hundreds of agreements on a variety of environmental challenges that followed the prototype Stockholm 1972 Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment. Instead, policy makers should follow a different approach, one that has had a surprising amount of success over the years -- nuclear disarmament. Initially, the great powers bet on a single negotiating process, ""General and Complete Disarmament,"" involving all members of the United Nations. But when the Cuban Missile Crisis crystallized the very real danger of the nuclear arms race, key governments identified aspects of the overall problem on which they might find common ground. Gradually, over time, this focus on smaller targets led to solid, incremental progress toward the overarching goals. The progress really started with the 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty, prohibiting nuclear testing in the atmosphere, in space, and under the seas. Issues since have been variously resolved opportunistically in multilateral, regional and bilateral fora with alternative bodies picking up the action when other efforts have stalled. The strategy was successful: In contrast to the dozens of nuclear powers expected by 2000, there are in fact only eight now, and there are still expected to be less than a dozen by 2020. Making deals with massive greenhouse-gas emitters China and India, as the President has done in recent weeks, echoes the productive bilateral arms efforts between the United States and the Soviet Union/Russia, two countries that control 90% of the world's nuclear weapons. Indeed, more than a dozen agreements over 40 years established communications channels and protocols to avoid accidental nuclear wars, and reduce nuclear weapon stockpiles from more than 25,000 each at the height of the Cold War to roughly 5,000 and 12,000, respectively, today. Of course, a deal-by-deal approach may not be enough to solve every climate-related challenge. But the nuclear context shows that success breeds success, and clear progress can create political momentum for further agreements. Significantly, virtually every multilateral nuclear agreement was put in place even though key countries refused to participate, yet the fact an agreement has been made created political pressures and norms that eventually prompted others to sign up. Essentially, the message is this: Why wait for the entire world to be on-board if a small number can make significant progress. Here in the United States, a parallel process is already taking place, mobilizing existing resources to improve energy efficiency, step-by-step. As part of this, the President appears to be experimenting -- productively, domestically and internationally -- with a variety of ways to break the huge challenge of climate change into smaller bites and alternative pathways. And this is where we see courage. Whether the President succeeds is not yet known to us. But he appears to have quietly and thoughtfully reviewed the options before him and staked out a realistic pathway, fraught with many dangers, to try to save humanity from the increasing threat of climate change.","Obama has shown courage on climate: Greenspan Bell and Blechman .

"Michelle Langbehn, 30, has endured nine months of chemotherapy, two cycles of radiation, a spinal fusion and several tumor removal surgeries. But the cancer that's attacking her body continues to spread, and her future treatment options are limited. There was hope for the Auburn, California, mom -- a clinical trial that's testing a new drug called Cabozantinib that's been approved to fight other cancers. Researchers at the National Institutes of Health had gathered Langbehn's medical records; they were set to evaluate her status on Monday to make an official enrollment decision, she says. Then the government shut down. Every week, hundreds of patients like Langbehn are admitted to new clinical trials at the National Institutes of Health. But as of Tuesday, these patients are being put on hold until the government resumes operation. ""Due to the lapse in government funding ... transactions submitted via the web site may not be processed, and the agency may not be able to respond to inquiries until appropriations are enacted,"" a message on the top of the NIH website states. Every week, about 200 new patients come to the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. Patients are now being told they will have to wait until the government starts up again to begin their trials, according to NIH spokesman John Burklow. ""In fact, six new studies would have started this week that we are deferring,"" Burklow said. Approximately 30 of the 200 new patients are children, he said, and about 10 of those children are cancer patients. ""I am furious,"" Langbehn said. ""They are denying or delaying potentially life-saving treatments to Americans in need of a miracle. I speak for everyone battling cancer when I saw we don't have time to wait."" Langbehn's oncologist gave her two years to live. That was last July. ""I do not plan on letting this take me away from my family,"" she says. Burklow did note that participants who are already in studies are still being treated and will continue with their trials. Burklow also said patients in desperate need of treatment will be handled differently and will more than likely be seen by physicians or nurses at the NIH Clinical Center. About 75% of NIH's employees -- or about 14,700 people -- have been furloughed. Researchers at other institutions who have received NIH grants are not affected by the government shutdown. But the agency is not accepting any new grant applications.","About 200 patients who start NIH clinical trials weekly must wait until shutdown ends .

"(CNN) -- The sub-zero climes of northern Sweden are an unlikely outpost for the world's hippest tech firms. Temperatures have been known to plummet to a bone-chilling minus-40 degrees centigrade in the winter months, while the rural landscape is more commonly associated with the sparkling beauty of the northern lights than the humdrum back office of cloud computing. But it's here, in the tiny sub-Arctic town of Lulea, that Facebook has operated a 30,000 square meter server farm since 2013 -- its first such facility outside the U.S.. So content with the operation is the social media giant that it announced the creation a second data center in Lulea earlier this year. According to Malin Frenning regional head of telecoms firm TeliaSonera the region has plenty to offer big international companies despite its distant location. ""There is a lot of (engineering) competence ... and good cooperation with the technical universities,"" Frenning said. On top of that, good transport links ensure its easily accessible by road and by air while solid infrastructure ensures business stability. TeliaSonera is currently laying down Skanova Backbone North, a 1,250-kilometer (776-mile) fiber cable that will serve mobile and communications networks as well as provide the digital infrastructure that data centers in northern Sweden require. ""As far as we understand it this is one of the best places to establish data centers,"" Frenning added. The Facebook move has inevitably attracted the attention of other firms with large data storage needs. Lulea will soon host another large data facility for UK-based data-storage specialist firm, Hydro66, while the nearby town of Boden welcomed Bitcoin mining group KnCMiner earlier this year. Across the border in Finland, Google runs a similar operation in the town of Hamina. And a thousand miles over the Norwegian Sea in Iceland specialist data storage firm Verne Global caters for large firms likes of German car manufacturer BMW. With so many wealthy companies with increased data related needs, storage clearly has the potential to become a highly lucrative business in this part of the world. A report from management firm, Boston Consultancy Group estimated that the Facebook's presence in Sweden will be worth upwards of 9 billion Swedish Kroner ($1.2 billion) and 4,500 direct and indirect jobs over a 10-year period. In September this year, meanwhile, the Financial Times cited a report from Bank of America Merrill Lynch which stated that energy efficiency in the $220 billion cloud computing market could become a significant driver of growth. Arctic appeal . The attraction of the extreme north for many tech companies is both practical and environmental. Cold temperatures mean the high costs associated with air conditioning units used to keep servers cool can be drastically reduced. An abundance of renewable energy sources, meanwhile, ensures the large amounts of electricity required to power data centers is clean and environmentally friendly. Iceland, for example, currently meets 100% of its energy needs through geothermal and hydro-electric sources, according to independent energy sector analysts Askja Energy. Northern Sweden is also blessed with a plethora of natural resources: Lulea has produced large amounts of hydro-electricity for well over a century. ""The environmental impact (of data centers in the north of Sweden) is pretty much zero,"" said Anne Graf of the Node Pole, a regional trade body designed to attract investment into Lulea, Boden and nearby town Pitea. ""We have about a 50% surplus from the electricity we produce,"" Graf added. For high-profile companies like Facebook -- which was once publicly scolded by Greenpeace for obtaining 53% of the electricity it uses from coal sources but has since said it wants to go green -- these are highly attractive qualities. Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimate that information and communication technologies are already consuming 10% of the world's produced electricity. A report from Greenpeace in April this year, meanwhile, found that if the internet was a country, it would rank in the top six energy consuming nations in the world. On top of this, Greenpeace say demand for electricity that powers internet usage is expected to increase by 60% or more by 2020. ""We don't really think that when we use our iPhone or Blackberry that somewhere there is a computer doing something,"" Graf said. ""When I do a Google search, somewhere there is a computer processing that. And that computer needs electricity. It needs ventilation. It needs someone to look after it."" IT greenwash? But not everyone is convinced that moving data centers to these icy climates is good for business -- or the environment. Yevgeniy Sverdlik of specialist IT publication Data Center Knowledge recognizes the potential environmental and cost benefits but highlights numerous circumstances where storing company data far away from headquarters or operations wouldn't be practical or cost effective. Big financial institutions require servers close to their core operations as they regularly perform trades where prices can change over a fraction of a second, Sverdlik said. If a signal from a trading desk in London or New York had to travel all the way along a cable to Sweden to confirm a trade, vital milliseconds could be lost. ""For companies like Facebook or even Google that kind of latency difference (the time between a button being pressed and that action occurring) is negligible,"" Sverdlik said. The data still moves at an extremely rapid pace. ""(But) a financial services company may have a physical location requirement where they want servers to be close to trading engines"" because of this. Then there are things like data protection laws that mean certain types of information like medical records or government data must be stored within particular jurisdictions. ""In the post-Snowden world there is mistrust (from people) in having their data held outside of their country,"" Sverdlik added. Professor Ian Bitterlin, chair of the Data Centre Specialist Group at the British Computer Society is even more cautious as to the benefits of storage units in these parts of the world. He points out that while cooling can be cheap and use less electricity near the Arctic for now, new server technologies are becoming more efficient and less power intensive. This could eventually mean it becomes equally cost effective to house data centers closer to business hubs and centers. ""They (locations in the likes of Sweden, Finland and Iceland) say they are attractive because they have a lot of spare power that they want to sell. ""They've lost industries like paper and aluminum and have an excess of power (and) data centers appear to be a very high revenue load. ""Some companies are attracted to the corporate social responsibility thing and want to get Greenpeace off their back."" ""(But) most clients won't go there because they want to build their data centers where they want their data centers.""","Some companies have begun operating large data centers near the Arctic .

"(CNN) -- The Graha Bhakti Budaya (or GBB as it's locally known), is a care-worn, 1960s slab of a building, popular as part of Jakarta's largest arts center, but outwardly unremarkable. Yet what happened inside on Monday, the Indonesian premiere of documentary ""The Look of Silence"", has for some made it more than a theater space and transformed it into a site of huge importance for the development of Indonesia's democracy. ""That screening on Monday night was a big, big moment,"" says 54-year-old Irawan Karseno. ""There are deep wounds in our nation since 1965 and this movie is like a healing process."" As head of the Jakarta Arts Council, Karseno was instrumental in bringing the film, Joshua Oppenheimer's companion piece to last year's Oscar-nominated ""The Act of Killing"", to a captivated audience of around 1,500 people. Oppenheimer's 2012 film helped open up public discussion about a troubling and little-spoken of period in Indonesia's recent history: human rights groups estimate between 500,000 to 1 million Indonesians were killed by military death squads during anti-communist purges in 1965 and 1966 that helped cement the ""New Order"" regime of General Suharto. While ""The Act of Killing"" told the story from the killers' side, ""The Look of Silence"" takes an unflinching look at the situation from the viewpoint of the survivors. The film's protagonist is Adi, a 45-year-old optometrist, who tries to understand why his parents remain so deeply traumatized by his brother Ramli's murder in 1965, and the culture of fear and lies he believes pervades his community and country. Adi's unflinching gaze when he confronts members of the militia involved in his brother's brutal death is juxtaposed with the attitude of perpetrators and survivors in the film, and many Indonesians as a whole, who prefer to say the ""past is the past"". ""But the younger generation are more open-minded,"" says Karseno. ""I was only five years old when these events happened and I'm still ashamed by them. ""Next year is 50 years since (the killings of) 1965. How can we prepare for next year? How can we see the events more sensitively? I hope it can be like when Germany came to terms with the holocaust and they had a healing process with each other."" After a multi-year investigation, the country's National Commission on Human Rights in 2012 declared the massacre a gross violation of human rights. Yet Indonesia is still a distance from any official truth and reconciliation process. No one has been brought to trial for the alleged crimes. The Attorney General's office has not yet replied to CNN's requests for comment. Many survivors' families across Indonesia still live in fear of reprisals if they should speak openly against those responsible for the crimes. During filming Oppenheimer made sure precautions were taken should things take a turn for the worse; a getaway car was on hand, no-one carried ID, phones were data-free and in some cases Adi's family were on standby at the airport to leave at a moment's notice. ""It's a terrible situation that Adi and his family had to move away like fugitives (after the film was made), especially when he was just trying to create the conditions for forgiveness,"" says Oppenheimer. ""But it shows just how far Indonesia has to go before it can be called a genuine democracy with rule of law and that because of the impunity the perpetrators and gangsters have Adi's family has to run away, when they've done only the most beautiful and dignified thing."" For Oppenheimer, Monday's premier was the most important screening of either ""The Act of Killing"" or ""The Look of Silence"" (which has appeared at a number of international film festivals), as it was hosted by Indonesian government agencies-- the Jakarta Arts Council and the National Human Rights Commission. While ""The Act of Killing"" first had to be shown at private screenings, even public showings initially had to have heavy security, ""The Look of Silence"" premier was publicly announced, proving to Oppenheimer, that a space is opening up for the country to continue to heal. In December community screenings will take place across Indonesia, and Karseno, encouraged by the recent election of Joko Widodo as president, feels optimistic that the country can get over its ""mental block."" ""We are pushing hard for Jokowi (Joko Widodo) to see the film,"" says Karseno. ""We have a problem in our culture. It's not just about 1960s for us, but how we as a country are connected to the rest of the world."" According to Karseno the atmosphere on Monday was only tense with expectation rather than from any safety worries, and two screenings had be shown as twice as many people turned up as could be accommodated by the auditorium. Adi was one of those present at the premier. ""After watching the film and seeing the victims I felt sad,"" says Karseno. ""I then met Adi and I just cried.""","Documentary 'The Look of Silence' show legacy of 1965 massacre in Indonesia .

"Watch your step as you climb these stairs, whether spiraling up mountains, narrow passageways or sky-scraping attractions. All is right with the world when you're gazing down from the rooftop of Milan's Duomo. That is, until you remember the steep marble stairs that got you there—and are your only way down. Stairways can leave just as much of an impact on your memory as the places they lead you. Some are so eye-catching they look like they belong in an M.C. Escher painting, while other stairs are downright intimidating, especially when they stand between you and a site you flew halfway across the world to experience. In Peru, for instance, travelers need to tackle about 600 feet of slippery granite rocks carved into the mountainside to reach the Moon Temple at Machu Picchu. And at Yosemite National Park, you can't take a selfie at the top of Half Dome without climbing a cable ladder up the rock face for more than 400 feet. All it takes is a misstep for any old staircase to become treacherous (just ask Jennifer Lawrence), yet some standout for being especially scary. A set of stairs in Hawaii is so precariously perched that climbing is now illegal. In China, there's a stairway with an age requirement. Other stairs are intimidating for more psychological reasons, such as the creaking noises made by the world's longest wooden stairway in Norway or the eerie atmosphere at ""The Stairway to Hell,"" part of an abandoned industrial complex in Japan. Travelers with nerves of steel—and eager for bragging rights—follow these stairs because of what they find at the end, whether a sacred Hindu temple or the top of a spectacular waterfall. There's nothing quite like the thrill of accomplishment that comes once you've taken that last step. Safely, that is. Angkor Wat Temple Stairs, Cambodia . In this super-humid hotbox of Buddhist history, there's no shame in bowing down on your hands and knees or pulling yourself up with the provided ropes to scale the nearly 70 percent inclined stairs of Angkor Wat's uppermost temples. Guides claim the steps were made to be so steep to remind people that heaven was hard to reach—though you might make the same argument about Earth as you try not to tumble on the way down. The Verrückt, Kansas City, Kansas . It takes guts just to reach the starting point of the world's tallest and fastest water slide, opened July 2014. To get to the top, you've got to climb the 264 steps that snake up the slide's tower in 25 turns. When you've summited at 168 feet—that's one foot taller than Niagara Falls—pat yourself on the back and take a selfie. Then brace yourself for the water slide's initial 50-foot linear drop, which can reach 65 mph. The only alternative is to turn around and suffer the 17-story walk back down those nauseating steps. Pailon del Diablo Waterfall, Ecuador . At first it's lovely to notice that the staircase adjacent to these waterfalls was designed to blend in with the tropical landscape. But consider the name—in English, the Devil's Cauldron—and the evil tricks the steep steps can play. They are made of smooth, oversize pebbles that provide little traction, and when you're looking down, they blend together, creating an optical illusion of a stone slide. They're also slippery from the constant mist from the falls and even though there's a metal railing to save you from any spills—but don't count on that too much—it too is drenched with water droplets. Half Dome, Cable Route, California . What's between you and the most iconic peak in Yosemite Valley? A seven-mile (one-way) all-incline hike through the wilderness that culminates with climbing up the rock face along a cable ladder for more than 400 vertical feet. If you're up for the challenge, snag one of the 300 hard-to-get daily permits available for Half Dome between Memorial Day and mid-October. (Check your footwear and the forecast; rainy conditions have proven fatal.) From the summit, you'll take in panoramic views of Yosemite Valley and the High Sierra. Travel + Leisure: World's coolest playgrounds . Inca Stairs, Peru . At Machu Picchu, 600 feet or so of steep, slippery, cloud-covered granite rocks the Inca carved more than 500 years ago into the side of Huayna Picchu (the peak in everyone's photos) lead to the rarely visited Moon Temple—and a spectacular view of the ruins. The park limits the climb to the first 400 visitors each morning and has added some metallic chains in the worst parts, so hold on because on one side is a sheer, damp wall and on the other, a straight drop into the Urubamba river. Statue of Liberty, New York City . If you want to gaze out from Lady Liberty's crown, check your claustrophobia at her feet. The platform's only access is via a cramped, 146-step double-helix spiral staircase with just six feet of head clearance—and it's teeming with tourists. Real troopers, however, will make the entire tight 377-step hike up all the way from the lobby, the equivalent of climbing a 20-story building. These physical challenges all come after you've managed another feat: snagging one of the hard to get passes that allow entry into the crown. They have to be booked at least three months in advance, are name and date specific and are limited to four per order. Florli Stairs, Norway . Norway's Flørli Power Station is the starting point for the best hikes around the town of Lysefjord—and its stairs will make you gasp for two reasons. First, there are 4,444 steps that ascend a staggering 2,427 feet from the bottom. Second, it is the longest staircase in the world made entirely out of wood, meaning you should be paying close attention to each mysterious creak and crack you hear. Mount Huashan Heavenly Stairs, China . There's no official count of steps on this cardiac stress test carved into a sacred Taoist mountain. Perhaps because anyone attempting to conquer this vertiginous washboard wall has lost count, distracted by the dizzying drop and its threat of death. Eventually, the steep ""heavenly stairs"" stop, and this becomes the most hellish horizontal walk in the world—a three-plank-wide walkway with only a chain to hold onto, flush against the wall of flat rock. When that's done, there's another set of meandering, mountainside stairs. If you get to the top of Mount Huashan, you'll discover that ""heaven"" is a remote tea house with a terrific view. Travel + Leisure: World's scariest bridges . Janssen Observatory, Mont Blanc, France . The steps are short and sweet. They're not cramped, they come with railings, and they don't get too crowded. What can make these stairs squeamish is their placement at the summit of the tallest mountain in the Alps, when they're open to the elements—gale-force winds and chilly temperatures. Batu Caves, Malaysia . One of the most important Hindu holy sites outside of India is this series of cave shrines nestled into the side of a mountain about eight miles from Kuala Lumpur. The highlight: accomplishing the ascent of 272 steps that lead 330 feet up the rock to the main Temple Cave. It's not just the stone stairs that test your temerity; it's the sneaky macaque monkeys. They aren't afraid of people and are liable to steal stuff right out of your bag. So while it's a good idea to climb without any food, it also can't hurt to say a prayer before going up. You may do so at the temple of Hanuman—the ""noble monkey""—to the far left of the entrance, near Ramayana Cave. Sagrada Familia, Barcelona . Gaudí envisioned a forest canopy when designing the rooftop of this Roman Catholic church, but climbing the spiral staircase to its towers feels more like crawling up a Slinky. Not only does it coil high along the tightly enclosed walls, but there's also no banister to prevent you from barreling over the middling edge while you're walking up and down with hordes of other people. Haiku Stairs, Oahu, Hawaii . Can stairs be so seriously scary that they've been banned? Answer: Yes. The 3,922 rickety steps that lead a half mile up Oahu's Koolau Mountain Range pose such a risk, it's actually illegal to climb them. There's even a guard placed at the bottom to stop you from going up. Nicknamed the Highway to Heaven, they were built in 1942 by the U.S. Navy as a means to installing communications wires. After World War II, they became popular with daredevil hikers. But by 1987, they had closed to the public for safety concerns, and they stay that way, despite a 2003 renovation project. Duomo di Milano, Milan . No visit to Milan is complete without having marveled at the view of Italy's northern city from the roof of this famed cathedral stacked with about 2,000 statues. But in order to check it off your bucket list, you're required to wiggle up and down a steep, slender staircase in a shaft way clogged with tourists. Tip: Head to La Rinascente, a department store across the street with a rooftop café that serves up perfect views of the cathedral and skyline—no stairs necessary.

"(CNN) -- President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping just announced a major agreement to cut carbon emissions in both countries and tackle global warming over the coming decades. As the news site Vox puts it, ""This is a big deal."" It's a big deal for citizens of both countries who will literally breathe easier due to reduced pollution. It's a big deal for the future of our planet. And it's even a big deal for Republicans, who had used inaction on the part of China to justify not doing anything about climate change here at home. And yet Republican leaders, many of whom remain inexplicably skeptical of the conclusive science about climate change, insist they will use their new congressional majority to try to obstruct clean air and water regulations enacted by the Environmental Protection Agency. For added measure, they will try to force President Obama to approve the construction of the Keystone pipeline extension. They will, apparently, be joined by centrist Democrats like Sen. Mary Landrieu, facing a tough run-off election for her seat in Louisiana in December. In other words, just as China is finally taking a significant step forward in reducing climate change emissions, the United States risks taking two steps back. China's economic growth already exceeds ours, and the International Monetary Fund has projected that in 2016 China will overtake America as the world's biggest economy. China has already passed the United States in the share of the world's college enrollment, producing more than twice as many college graduates each year. Will China also beat the United States in the race to address climate change and profit from doing so? The Keystone XL pipeline is a great test case. The disastrous environmental impact of the pipeline is obvious. Simply mining the tar sands — let alone consuming the actual oil down the road — will release an incredible amount of carbon into the atmosphere. Then the thick tar sands crude would go into the 1,179 mile long Keystone XL pipeline, winding past family farms and playgrounds and lakes and water reservoirs as it makes its way from Canada to Texas. The current Keystone pipeline, which runs from Canada to the Midwest, leaked a record 12 times just in its first year of operation. Even if you're a conservative who doesn't believe the vast majority of the world's scientists agree that climate change is both real and man-made, hopefully you still believe in facts. And the facts suggest that the Keystone XL pipeline is a bad deal not just for America's environment but also for our economy. In 2008, in its original application to the State Department seeking pipeline approval, the company TransCanada said the Keystone XL pipeline would involve ""a peak workforce of approximately 3,500 to 4,200 construction personnel."" But by 2011, when the pipeline project had become controversial, TransCanada told a House subcommittee the project would create 20,000 jobs. TransCanada and the American Petroleum Institute have also alleged that an additional 119,000 jobs would be directly or indirectly created by the pipeline. Yet an independent academic study found the project would indeed create ""no more than 2,500-4,650 temporary direct construction jobs for two years"" and that, in fact, spills and the cost of damage from the pipeline could kill more jobs than it creates in the long term. Well, at least the pipeline would help working families in America by lowing gas prices, right? Wrong. According to analysis by both CNN and Bloomberg, the pipeline would actually raise gas prices by creating a way for oil produced in the Midwest to make it to coastal refineries for exporting. What the Keystone XL pipeline clearly would do is divert investment away from renewable energy — and investments in renewable energy produce more bang for the buck. Every $1 million invested in fossil fuels creates just 5.3 jobs while the same amount invested in clean energy creates 16.7 jobs. In other words, if America builds the Keystone XL pipeline, not only are we not getting a lot of short-term jobs out of the deal and risking the economic cost of crude spills, but we're failing to put investment into green energy opportunity that will yield far more jobs now and in the future. It's plain to see which choice makes sense not only for our planet but for our economy and working families. Earlier this year, the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate released a report detailing that over the next 15 years, worldwide efforts to limit carbon emissions would cost about $4 trillion, which is about 5% more than would already be spent on infrastructure upgrades to power plants and public transit and other systems. But once you factor in things like lower fuel costs plus fewer deaths from pollution and lower medical bills, this greening actually saves money. But what it also does is create big potential to make money from the companies — and countries — leading the way. Solar technology alone generates over $100 billion per year in revenues worldwide, a figure steadily climbing. Currently, China makes 64% of the world's solar panels and their production is expected to double by 2017. The United States is lagging behind in this and other rapidly expanding green markets. There was a time when Republicans openly accepted the realities of climate change and championed public policy solutions. Now the issue has become yet another partisan football. Projects like the Keystone XL pipeline are championed by conservatives not because they make any rational or economic sense but because they are convenient symbols for protesting climate science and President Obama. Meanwhile, as Republicans bury their heads in the sand, China has an eye toward the future. If we don't catch up and take real steps to join the green energy future now, America risks being left behind — drowning in a crude-like pool of our own economic irrelevance.","Sally Kohn: The U.S.-China agreement to cut carbon emissions is a big deal .

"The man who ran the West Virginia mine that exploded in 2010, in what was one of the worst U.S. mine disasters in decades, was indicted Thursday on federal charges. Don Blankenship, the former CEO of Massey Energy, faces four charges: conspiracy to violate mandatory federal mine safety and health standards, conspiracy to impede federal mine safety officials, making false statements to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and securities fraud. The counts carry a maximum combined penalty of 31 years in prison, according to the Justice Department. ""The indictment alleges that from about January 1, 2008, through about April 9, 2010, Blankenship conspired to commit and cause routine, willful violations of mandatory federal mine safety and health standards at Massey Energy's Upper Big Branch mine, located in Raleigh County, West Virginia,  the department said in a statement. Massey was the fourth-largest coal producer in the United States and the largest mine operator in Appalachia at the time of the Upper Big Branch explosion, which killed 29 workers. But it had racked up an extensive list of violations before the disaster, and a 2011 report by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration found that Massey had a history of ""systematic, intentional, and aggressive efforts"" to evade safety regulations. The company kept two sets of books to mislead miners and inspectors, tipped off crews before surprise inspections and intimidated workers to prevent them from reporting violations, the report found. Blankenship's attorney, William W. Taylor, III, said Thursday that his client is innocent of the charges, and will fight them and be acquitted. ""Don Blankenship has been a tireless advocate for mine safety. His outspoken criticism of powerful bureaucrats has earned this indictment. He will not yield to their effort  to silence him. He will not be intimidated,"" the lawyer said. Massey was bought by another company, Alpha Natural Resources, after the disaster. In December 2011, it settled with the Justice Department for a record $209 million in fines, penalties and compensation for families of the men killed at Upper Big Branch.","Don Blankenship faces four federal charges, including conspiracy and making false statements .

During this period rebel groups like the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) -- who were notorious for hacking off limbs and indoctrinating children into their struggle -- fought government forces and their offshoots for control of the diamond rich West African state. Desperate for help, Beah says he wandered the countryside with a group of other children who had lost their families in similar circumstances. They managed to avoid the roaming RUF rebels but witnessed gunfights, ransacked villages and countless dead bodies along the way. ""I saw a man carrying his son that had been shot dead, but he was trying to run with him to the hospital,"" Beah recalls. ""(There was also) this woman had been running and she had a baby that was tied on her back. She'd been running away from the fighting and the bullet had struck the baby and the baby had been killed but she didn't know."" Eventually Beah and his friends came across a rural camp they initially believed to be an army base. They soon realized however that they had in fact stumbled upon a battalion of breakaway Sierra Leonean soldiers. The splinter group opposed the RUF but were pursuing similarly vicious fighting tactics, including the deployment of child soldiers. Beah was taken in, given shelter and eventually trained to kill. ""Somebody being shot in front of you, or you yourself shooting somebody became just like drinking a glass of water. Children who refused to fight, kill or showed any weakness were ruthlessly dealt with. ""Emotions weren't allowed,"" he continued. ""For example a nine-year-old boy cried because they missed their mother and they were shot,"" he says of the era which was portrayed in the 2006 Hollywood film ""Blood Diamond,"" starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Djimon Hounsou. See also: Sudan child soldier turned U.S. Olympian . Speaking about the moment he became separated from his family, Beah recalls: ""I had gone to a talent show, I was interested in American hip-hop music, with my older brother, to another town and my town was attacked. I went from having an entire family to the next minute not having anything. It was very painful."" Now a U.N. goodwill ambassador, a law graduate and a best-selling author, Beah is heading the fight to publicize the plight of child soldiers in Africa. ""I do work with UNICEF to go to some of these places, but also to meet the young people who are coming from these experiences to reassure them that it is possible to come out of this,"" he says. ""I can speak to these children. With proper integration this is the way you can have a successful removal of children from armed groups"" See also: Former child soldier remembers . Beah says he now has a greater understanding as to why children are viewed as such valuable fighting assets to groups like the RUF across Africa. According to the United Nations there remains an estimated 300,000 children involved in conflicts around the world today. ""Everybody always asks why do they go after children? Because you can easily manipulate them,"" he says. ""They also want to belong to something, especially if they live in a society that has collapsed completely. Their communities are broken down, they want to belong to anything slightly organized and these groups become that."" Beah felt this acceptance in his division of child soldiers and fought with the group for two years before eventually being rescued by UNICEF. He was taken to a rehab center in the Sierra Leone capital, Freetown, where he spent eight months learning about what happened to him and readjusting to life after the war. Those who worked at the center were frequently attacked by child soldiers finding it difficult to adapt to their new surroundings in the early days. ""We were very angry. We were very destructive. We destroyed the center where we were staying at (and) we burned some things up,"" he says of his early months there. ""We beat up the staff members. They came back, we beat them up some more."" With time, and the patience of a carer named Nurse Esther, however, Beah says he was eventually able to reconnect to his lost childhood and remember the person he once was. He also credits the hip-hop music he loved as an innocent 12-year-old and the songs of Bob Marley as a major help in his recovery. See also: From child soldier to child savior . Beah's progress was so impressive that in 1996 he was selected to go to the United Nations and speak to a conference led by Graca Machel, Nelson Mandela's wife, on the plight of child soldiers. It was during this trip that he would meet Laura Sims -- a UNICEF worker who would eventually adopt him and bring him to America when the conflict in Sierra Leone escalated to engulf Freetown in 1998. Upon moving to the U.S., Beah enrolled at the United Nations school in New York before going on to graduate in 2004 with a degree in Political Science from Oberlin College in Ohio. During his studies he also wrote a book on his experiences as a youth in Sierra Leone, ""A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier"". ""I finished this book before I graduated. I never intended to publish it but the idea for writing it was really this desire to just find a way to give the human context that was missing in the way the issue of child soldiers were discussed,"" he says. His passion for bringing a greater understanding to the experiences of child soldiers has since led Beah to his current role as a U.N. ambassador for children affected by war. And he hopes to offer the same support to today's child soldiers as Nurse Esther and the staff at the Freetown rehab center offered him. ""I witness UNICEF workers doing all of this and when these children were removed I felt their confusion,"" he says. ""I've been in that place before. All of a sudden you no longer have your military gear, you're now a kid."" ""What I'm saying to them is that everybody has the capacity to find their own talent with the right opportunities to do something more with their lives, and everybody can walk their own path.""","Ishmael Beah was a child soldier during the Sierra Leonean civil war .

"Two Southwestern senators say their colleagues might find some common ground if they start holding monthly bipartisan lunches. Sens. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, and Martin Henrich, D-New Mexico, are lobbying their parties' top members, incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and incoming Minority Leader Harry Reid, to start holding the meetings. They've organized a group of 32 senators who made the request in a letter this week. They pointed to a ""frank, open and fruitful discussion"" the two parties held in the Old Senate Chamber in July 2013, and said more of those meetings might help -- especially with nearly half the Senate's members serving their first terms. ""We believe that regular bipartisan meetings like the one in July 2013 can help foster the kind of productive relationships that will be critical for the Senate to live up to its reputation as the world's most deliberative body,"" the senators wrote to McConnell and Reid. ""It is our hope that our respective leadership teams can take concrete steps to broaden the relationships and deepen the rapport among members,"" they wrote. ""Specifically, we believe that monthly bipartisan lunches would serve this goal. Given that our caucuses already meet separately at least twice weekly, surely scheduling a bipartisan lunch just once a month would make for a workable option."" Their request comes after months of howling about the Senate's ability to function. Republicans blame Reid, the outgoing majority leader, for failing to give their bills and amendments a fair hearing. Democrats blame the GOP, saying its members have been bent for years on obstructing President Barack Obama's agenda. Republicans captured the Senate majority in this year's midterm elections. McConnell will become the majority leader when new lawmakers are sworn in early next year.","Sens. Jeff Flake and Martin Heinrich want senators to hold monthly bipartisan lunches .

"In an exclusive interview with CNN, Dr. Thomas Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reflected on the lowest moments -- and the surprises -- that occurred when Thomas Eric Duncan became the first person to unexpectedly arrive in the United States with Ebola. Duncan has been the only person in the United States to die of the disease, and two nurses who cared for him  became infected with the virus. The CDC was roundly criticized for its handling of the crisis, and some Republican lawmakers called for Frieden's resignation. Frieden's lowest moment: when the first nurse, Nina Pham, was diagnosed with Ebola. ""We learned that the situation wasn't going to be as simple or as controlled as we thought it would be, and we immediately intensified our response to address the situation in Dallas,"" he said. He said his biggest surprise was the difficulty of Duncan's care. ""Out of Control"" how the world reacted as Ebola spread, an interactive time line . ""I think we didn't recognize how hard it would be to care for someone with Ebola who was desperately ill in the U.S., and how much hands-on nursing care there would be, and we didn't expect two nurses to get infected,"" Frieden said. During Duncan's hospitalization, Frieden repeatedly said in press conferences that any hospital in the United States should be able to treat Ebola. CNN asked Frieden if he regretted those statements, considering that at Texas Presbyterian Hospital, Duncan died and two nurses became infected, but the other nine U.S. Ebola patients, who were treated at hospitals that were specially designated to treat the disease, all lived. In those cases no workers became infected. New Ebola patient coming to the United States . ""Clearly there are things that we wish we'd done differently,"" he said. ""The bottom line is that Ebola is hard to treat, and when the first patient ever with Ebola came to the United States, we thought the guidelines would protect the health care workers. When two health care workers became infected, we recognized the guidelines didn't work. So we changed them."" He added that one thing his agency would have done differently would have been to tell nurse Amber Vinson not to board an airplane from Cleveland to Dallas. Vinson had taken care of Duncan and had reported a temperature of 99.5 degrees, but was told she could fly, because the CDC's threshold at that time for Ebola was 100.4 degrees. Vinson later was diagnosed with Ebola. Ebola photographer: I broke down that day . CNN also asked if he considered leaving his post when several Republican lawmakers called for his resignation. ""I'm really just focused on stopping Ebola. I'm working around the clock to do that, and I will continue to do that, as long as Ebola is spreading, as long as I have the opportunity to do that,"" he said. ""I wish I had know then what we know now,"" he added. ""But that's not how the world works. We live life forwards and we understand it backwards. Looking back with 20/20 hindsight, there are always things we would do differently.""","The CDC's Dr. Thomas Frieden talks about the lowest moment of the Ebola epidemic for him .

"Arriving in a city with an area five times the size of New York City and 23 million people can be overwhelming. Fortunately Shanghai -- the most developed city on mainland China -- is equipped to impress even the most jaded of international business travelers. The problem, as usual, is finding the time to experience its highlights. From getting in quick to getting out with the hottest souvenirs -- and having eaten plenty of fantastic food in between -- this mini-guide offers tips for time starved executive travelers looking for the best of Shanghai. Fastest, most comfortable airport transport . Just getting out of the airport in Shanghai is a thrill if you climb aboard world's fastest commercial train, the Shanghai Maglev. This airport shuttle connects Shanghai Pudong International Airport with Longyang Lu Station in the suburbs of Pudong. From there, passengers switch to Metro Line 2 or 7 to travel to the city center. Moving like a silver bullet, Maglev trains cover 30 kilometers in about seven minutes. Metro Line 2 also runs between Longyang Lu and the airport -- the journey takes about an hour. Maglev trains run once every 15 to 20 minutes and cost RMB50 ($8) for a single trip and RMB80 ($13) for a round-trip, good for seven days. Rooms with views . Nothing motivates you to get down to business like waking up to amazing views of the Shanghai skyline from a centrally located hotel. On a sunny, smog-free day the best Shanghai views can be found at the Park Hyatt. The 174-room hotel occupies the 79th to 93rd floors of the 492-meter-tall Shanghai World Financial Center -- the tallest functioning building in Shanghai. Rooms look down on the awe-inspiring high-rise matrix of Pudong. Over on the Bund, Waldorf Astoria Shanghai and The Peninsula Shanghai are top choices for straight-on views toward the skyscrapers of Lujiazui. If you'd rather enjoy views of both sides of the curved Huangpu River, you'll want to check into the Hyatt on the Bund on the north end, or Indigo Hotel on the south end. The latter also provides views of Shanghai Old Town.

When it comes to dinner, Maison de L'hui on Julu Lu is the place to impress the pickiest of clients. This authentic Chinese restaurant is located in a revamped mansion that once belonged to 1930s mafia kingpin Du Yuesheng. It serves local classics such as Shanghai-style deep-fried fish (no batter, it's marinated in dark soy sauce) and soup noodles topped with yellow croakers (fish). Elsewhere, tree-lined Jinxian Lu is a relaxing little street known for its authentic home kitchens, such as Lan Xin and Hai Jin Zi. In these no-frills restaurants, chatty Shanghainese women greet you in a cramped dining room as their husbands cook up some of Shanghai's best braised pork belly, stir-fried shrimps and tofu soup. Qibao Water Town on the outskirts of Shanghai has a brilliant food street that offers unforgettable xiaolongbao, pig trotters and Shanghai-style glutinous dumplings.

Hai Jin Zi, 240 Jinxian Lu, near Shaanxi Nan Lu; +86 21 6255 0371 . Unique clothes . The best shopping trophy for traveling fashionistas is a tailor-made Shanghai qipao. Originally an ethnic dress of Manchu people, the qipao was immortalized by the flirty Shanghai calendar girls of the 1930s, and then by year 2000 film ""In the Mood for Love"" starring Maggie Cheung. The best qipao tailors in Shanghai gather in two locations: Changle Lu (between Shaanxi Nan Lu and Ruijin Yi Lu) and Maoming Nan Lu (between Huaihai Zhong Lu and Fuxing Zong Lu). Among them, Han Yi on Changle Lu is said to have supplied qipao for Maggie Cheung for her role in ""In the Mood for Love."" A typical tailor-made qipao costs RMB 2,000 ($325) and up and takes around two weeks to make. In a rush? Shanghai Tang, which has several outlets in Shanghai, sells stylish off-the-rack pieces, including Mandarin collar jackets and shirts for men.

Zhongshan Park in the west side of the city is a great place to document Shanghai's morning exercise culture -- serious-looking retirees practicing fan dancing, Mulan boxing and gentle martial arts. Afterward, for an Instagram shot that'll make all your followers hungry, De Xin Guan on Guangdong Lu is great for lunch. This popular local restaurant is known for noodles and incredible xiaolongbao (pleated pork dumplings). The afternoon can be spent capturing the disappearing side of Shanghai in the Old Town, where residents enjoy a traditional alleyway lifestyle. When the sun sets, Shanghai is at its most glamorous. There are two perfect locations to photograph the neon-lit skylines. In Puxi, we recommend the rooftop terrace of Bar Rouge in Bund 18. In Pudong, the rooftop bar at The Ritz-Carlton offers an unforgettable view towards the vast Puxi area. De Xin Guan, 471 Guangdong Lu, near Fujian Zhong Lu; +86 21 6352 2535 .

Places to experience the heart of the city . The former French Concession is the most pleasant and walkable area of Shanghai. An ideal starting point for a 30-minute walking tour is the statue of Russian author Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin, located at the meeting point of Taojiang Lu, Yueyang Lu and Fenyang Lu. This is the heart of the former concession and a fine place to get lost in the neighborhood. All its streets are charming and fun to explore. The streets between People's Square and the Bund make up another intriguing area -- the oldest part of Shanghai developed by the British colonists. You can use Fuzhou Lu as an axis and explore the surrounding small streets, slowly making your way eastbound toward the Bund. These backstreets paint a good portrait of Shanghai's economic transition, with modern office buildings and high-end art galleries standing next to wet markets, tiny local food stalls and residential alleyways. The neighborhood also contains one of the few Muslim quarters in Shanghai, located between Guangxi Bei Lu and Zhejiang Zhong Lu. Easy-to-pack souvenirs . Shanghai's top knickknack emporium is the Fuyou Wholesale Market in the Old Town. Local residents and businessmen come here for gifts or decor at two-thirds of the regular retail price. Many objects are souvenir candidates, such as colorful chopsticks, purses and cushion covers made with brocade, or bottle openers shaped like Peking Opera masks. You can also hit the Dongtai Lu Antique market for mass-produced Mao pins and Little Red Books. Few objects in this market are really antique, but they still make cool souvenirs. Remember to bargain -- half the asking price is a good strategy. Tianzifang on Taikang Lu is another good source of souvenirs. Apart from the many boutiques filled with wacky T-shirts, communist-style postman bags and mugs, this amazing alleyway shopping complex has adorable tea shops selling carefully packed Chinese loose-leaf tea, handcrafted jewelry and artistic postcards.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Solemn music from the world's biggest stars served as the soundtrack to Friday night's telethon for Haiti relief, but the fundraiser ended with Wyclef Jean shouting ""Enough of the moping, let's rebuild Haiti."" Organizers did not immediately say how much money was raised during the two-hour ""Hope for Haiti Now"" show, but donations will continue to flow in as the phone lines remained open and the night's musical performances are sold on iTunes. A moving performance by Alicia Keys opened the telethon. Actor George Clooney, serving as the Los Angeles host for the event, made the first appeal for donations to raise money for relief efforts after last week's devastating earthquake. ""The Haitian people need our help,"" Clooney said. ""They need to know they are not alone. They need to know that we still care."" The show was one of the most widely distributed prime-time televised benefits in history, appearing simultaneously on more than 25 networks -- including CNN, where Anderson Cooper reported live from Haiti during the event. Children left homeless and orphaned by the earthquake were front and center. ""Hundreds and thousands of children in Haiti are lost and they're looking for their parents,"" actress Halle Berry said. ""Please, look into your heart. Please, help these children of Haiti."" Cooper, in one of several live appearances, was joined by 5-year-old Monley, a Haitian boy who was pulled alive -- but severely dehydrated -- from the rubble nearly eight days after the quake. Ten members of his family, including both parents, were killed. Actor Samuel L. Jackson, walking in front of a phone bank staffed by celebrities, assured viewers that ""100 percent of your donations will go directly to organizations that are on the ground right now."" More than 100 actors, musicians and other celebrities answered phones in New York and Los Angeles -- after professional operators first talked to donors. ""Thank you so much for your donation,"" actress Reese Witherspoon told one caller. ""You can't imagine how much love and great, wonderful energy is here today. People are doing everything they can to make a difference in these people's lives."" ""I'm just calling to help out,"" the male donor said. ""I couldn't donate a lot, but what I could I did donate."" Several other calls were aired live, including with Julia Roberts, Steven Spielberg, Taylor Swift and Stevie Wonder. Boxing great Muhammed Ali appeared with comedian Chris Rock by his side. Ali -- who was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease 25 years ago -- sat silently as Rock delivered a message he said was written by Ali. ""There's an old saying that charity begins at home, but it cannot end there,"" Rock said. Jean -- a native of Haiti and the New York host for the event -- talked about his visit last week to Haiti. ""I was there to clear away concrete and pull away rubble,"" Jean said. ""I carried bodies of my people to the cemetery."" Jean's ""Yele Haiti Foundation"" will receive some of the money raised. ""From the ashes we shall rise, so please give what you can,"" he said. Bruce Springsteen performed ""We Shall Overcome,"" a spiritual that became the anthem of the U.S civil rights movement. ""This is a small prayer for Haiti,"" Springsteen said as he began. Other musical performers included Stevie Wonder, Shakira, Beyonce, Mary J. Blige, Coldplay, Christina Aguilera, Taylor Swift, John Legend, Justin Timberlake, Kid Rock, Sheryl Crow, Keith Urban, Jennifer Hudson, Madonna, Dave Matthews and Neil Young. Bono, The Edge, Jay-Z and Rihanna also joined for a song. Haitian singer Emeline Michel performed ""Many Rivers to Cross,"" a Jimmy Cliff song. Other celebrities appearing on the telethon included John Stewart, Brad Pitt, Tom Hanks, Morgan Freeman, Ben Stiller, Clint Eastwood and Denzel Washington. The show -- presented by MTV -- was carried on CNN.com/Live and the CNN iPhone application. Other networks airing ""Hope for Haiti"" included ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, BET, The CW, HBO, MTV, VH1 and CMT. The show was also aired on the Discovery's eco-lifestyle television network, Planet Green. Proceeds from the telethon will benefit Oxfam America, Partners in Health, the Red Cross, UNICEF, the U.N. World Food Programme, Yele Haiti Foundation, and the Clinton Bush Haiti Foundation. The event is not the first time the stars have come out to drum up donations in the aftermath of a catastrophe. Celebrities stepped up to lend their names and voices to telethons after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Hurricane Katrina and the tsunami in South Asia. The predecessor of them all was Live Aid, which raised millions for the continent of Africa and was broadcast around the world in 1985. Judy McGrath, the CEO of MTV Networks, told People magazine that she received a phone call from Clooney two days after the earthquake. The actor wanted to help, she said. ""He jumped in with such incredible commitment,"" McGrath said. ""And he had already spoken to Bono, Wyclef, Sting and Bruce."" That commitment became the foundation for ""Hope for Haiti."" Putting his money where his star power is, Clooney has donated $1 million. Sandra Miniutti, vice president of the charity evaluation organization Charity Navigator, said the relationship between charities and stars is mutually beneficial. ""The celebrity looks more altruistic to the public. They are seen doing good things and it makes them more endearing,"" she said. ""For the charity, it makes them more important that they are able to be affiliated with such a well-known person."" Charities wouldn't be able, financially, to pay for the type of publicity and exposure celebrities bring to a cause, Miniutti said. And the success of drives such as the ""American Idol"" campaign, ""Idol Gives Back,"" show the public doesn't mind programming that both entertains and inspires generosity. In the case of Haiti, Miniutti said she believes the devastating images and stories are having a profound effect on the public. ""We are just seeing such a tremendous outpouring of support,"" she said. ""I think people really do want to help."" Musical performances from the telethon will be available for purchase and download from Apple's iTunes store. Apple, the record labels and the artists have pledged to donate their share of the proceeds to Haiti relief funds managed by the telethon charities.

"(CNN)European airlines beware:  Eurostar, the high-speed train company connecting London with Brussels and Paris, has just upped its game. On Thursday, the company unveiled its new e320 train at London's St. Pancras Station. The new train will go into commercial service at the end of 2015. The e320 is named for its max speed -- 320 kilometers per hour (200 mph). ""Over the last twenty years, we have led the way in cross-Channel high speed rail travel, cementing the link between the UK and mainland Europe,"" said Nicolas Petrovic, chief executive of Eurostar, in a statement to the press. While airplane passengers increasingly have to endure shrinking legroom, the new Eurostar trains have been built to be roomy. The ergonomically-designed reclining seats are wider, and each comes with its own USB socket and touch sensitive light controls. ""The combination of bold design, chic interiors and wi-fi connectivity will raise the bar, providing an unprecedented level of style and comfort for our customers,"" added Petrovic. Other on-board perks include a 20% increase in capacity per train (seven trains will join the fleet next year), free wi-fi, and increased luggage areas. The design comes courtesy of Pininfarina, the Italian design studio that has worked with the likes of Ferrari and Maserati. The new design was unveiled to coincide with Eurostar's 20-year anniversary. During that time, the company has served over 150 million customers, though Petrovic believes that's just the tip of the iceberg. Next year, Eurostar also plans to expand its network to include direct service to Provence, with stops in Lyon, Avignon and Marseille, followed by the launch of a direct route to Amsterdam in 2016.","Eurostar unveiled its new e320 train on Thursday .

"Kosovo may not be recognized by the United Nations but the region has taken a giant leap towards acceptance in the soccer world thanks to FIFA's decision to allow its national team to play in international matches. Football's world governing body has given dispensation to Kosovo to participate in friendly games against its 208 member states after repeatedly blocking previous requests for recognition. Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008, is not a member of the United Nations -- despite being recognized by 90 countries -- or UEFA, which governs European football. It has been under U.N. administration and patrolled by NATO troops since a 1999 bombing campaign that halted a Serb-led campaign against Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority. FIFA president Sepp Blatter told the organization's executive committee in Budapest that the decision would bring Kosovo into line with other Balkan countries and put it on the path to full membership. But the Football Association of Serbia (FSS) reacted angrily, posting a statement on its official website that spoke of the ""negative and harmful effects"" the ruling could have. ""We strongly protest the decision by FIFA's executive committee to allow the world soccer governing body's members to play friendly matches with the so-called national team of the so-called Republic of Kosovo,"" the FSS said. ""The decision made behind closed doors in Budapest without any consultations with either UEFA or the Serbian Football Association blatantly contravenes the FIFA statutes. ""Hence we will ask for an urgent meeting with FIFA President Sepp Blatter and his UEFA counterpart Michel Platini to demand a reverse of this unjustified decision which could have far-reaching consequences across the region."" But in reply, FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke invited the Serbian FA to a meeting at the ruling body's headquarters in Zurich to discuss the ramifications. In a letter to Tomislav Karadzic, President of the FSS, Valcke said: ""We would like to stress that the FIFA Executive Committee made clear that such authorization does not constitute a step towards FIFA membership, which depends on other considerations. ""In particular, and according to both the current and draft statutes of FIFA, as long as (Football Federation of Kosovo) is not a member of UEFA it cannot be a member of FIFA. The decision was intended purely to support the development of our sport."" Kosovo is recognized by the United Kingdom, the United States and Germany, as well as all its immediate neighbors apart from Serbia.","FIFA defends decision to permit Kosovo to participate in international matches .

"(CNN)Before the world was obsessed with the magic of ""Frozen,"" there was ""Wicked."" And now that musical may be coming to the big screen next year. Producer Marc Platt of ""Into the Woods"" -- itself a movie based on a hit Broadway play -- told Film Divider that a ""Wicked"" film could come in 2016, ""but it's not set in stone."" ""The process of developing that movie has begun. We're working on it, and whether it makes 2016 or not, I'm not so sure,"" Platt  said. The hit Broadway show, based on the 1995 novel ""Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West"" by Gregory Maguire, is a prequel to ""The Wizard of Oz."" In 2004, the musical earned future ""Frozen"" star Idina Menzel a Tony for best leading actress in a musical for her portrayal of the witch Elphaba. Costar Kristin Chenoweth was also nominated for her work as the good witch, Glinda. Platt said the creators of the musical want to take their time with the film, as they have set the bar very high for a big-screen adaption. Stephen Schwartz wrote the music and lyrics for the play, with dialogue by Winnie Holzman, who Platt said is currently writing the movie script. ""Audiences enjoy that show so much that we are intending to move forward on the movie but aren't going to do so until we're satisfied in the material we have as a screenplay, and that the film will be every bit as satisfying as what we have on the stage."" So before you get ready to defy gravity, know that Platt is advising fans to patience. ""It took 27 years to make 'Into the Woods' into a film from its original stage production, and 30 years with 'Les Mis,' "" he said. ""Some things take time for a reason.""","The producer says movie based on hit Broadway show could come in 2016 .

"A foreign submarine recently trespassed in Swedish territory, officials there said Friday, but they couldn't say what country the vessel belonged to. The Swedish military began an intense sweep of the waters off the coast of Stockholm more than three weeks ago. On Friday, the Swedish Armed Forces announced that its investigation confirmed that a submarine was indeed in Swedish waters. When the search started, the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet reported that the military became suspicious after Swedish intelligence picked up an emergency radio call in Russian. Russia denied that it had any vessel in Swedish waters. Russia flexes muscles with long-range bomber flights near U.S. shores . While confirming that there was a territorial violation, the military said that ""the analysis cannot determine the nationality of the intruder."" Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven gave a warning to whoever the intruder may have been. ""The government considers this to be extraordinary serious,"" he said in a news conference. ""Those who consider to enter Swedish territory shall understand what huge risks it will mean in the future."" He vowed to strengthen Sweden's ability to identify illegal activities in its waters. Opinion: Russia taking jabs at Sweden . Sweden used naval, ground and air military assets to investigate the report of the submarine, the armed forces said. One military observation determined, with ""no doubt"" that the foreign vessel was a submarine. In a statement, the military declined to elaborate on its finding, saying it did not want to disclose details about its capabilities. But the armed forces did say that observations from the public helped in their investigation.","Sweden confirms that a foreign submarine from an unknown county was in its waters .

"(CNN)""If our party is not welcoming and inclusive, young people and increasingly other voters will continue to tune us out."" That was the Republican Party's own take on the 2012 election as it acknowledged in an autopsy report (otherwise known as the Growth & Opportunity Project) that it was failing to appeal to minority voters. Unfortunately, too many Republicans have already forgotten this lesson, a reality made all the clearer by the response to recent revelations that House Majority Whip Steve Scalise spoke to a white supremacist group 12 years ago. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich was just one of those who seemed more interested in making excuses than holding Republicans to the standard they had supposedly set for themselves. Appearing on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" Gingrich brushed off the accusations, suggesting it was a ""stupidly"" scheduled meeting, while noting that President Barack Obama attended the church of the racially divisive Rev. Jeremiah Wright for 20 years. Gingrich also attempted to pivot to the media's treatment of Democrats with racist records. ""You have (Sen. Robert) Byrd who was the majority leader and a Klan leader. You have Hugo Black, who was a justice, who was a Klan leader. But they were Democrats and being in the Klan was OK,"" Gingrich lectured. Actually, none of that was OK. But this isn't about Democrats -- it's about the racist undercurrent that has been corrupting the GOP for decades, and the fact that the party's establishment has too often looked the other way. Unfortunately, it feels like every time a Republican is caught behaving like a racist in the 21st century, prominent members of the GOP try to change the subject to Democrats behaving badly instead of denouncing what is going on. What exactly did Scalise do to deserve the opprobrium that critics have justifiably heaped on him? Well, in 2002, as a Louisiana state representative, Scalise spoke to the European-American Unity and Rights Organization, founded by former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke. Scalise alleges a staffer scheduled the appearance and that he wasn't aware of the group's, uh, ""divisive racial and religious views,"" as he wrote in a statement. Yet Scalise's claims of plausible deniability just don't add up. For a start, The Washington Post reported that Kenny Knight, his neighbor at the time and a longtime Duke adviser, requested Scalise speak to the group and said Scalise ""knew who I was, but I don't think he held it against me."" But we don't even need to look to someone else's take to get a feel for Scalise's past. In 1999, Scalise reportedly told Roll Call he shared Duke's ""conservative"" views but said that ""the novelty of David Duke has worn off."" More recently, in 2004, Scalise voted against declaring a state holiday honoring civil rights leader the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Collectively, these actions don't look like those of an elected official who rejects ""that kind of hateful bigotry,"" as Scalise noted in his statement, but instead suggest a man trying to play politics in a state where only 13% of his congressional district's residents are black. Gingrich also told ""Face the Nation"" host Bob Schieffer that Mia B. Love, the first black Republican woman elected to Congress, had said Scalise has been ""helpful"" to her, as if this somehow negates what Scalise has done. But isn't helping out a fellow member of the GOP a pretty basic requirement of the job for someone in a leadership position? I admire Love, but the truth is that as a black woman myself, I have no idea how she could say on ABC's ""This Week"" that she believes Scalise ""should remain in leadership,"" particularly since Love doesn't appear to have had experience working directly with him. Perhaps Love was trying to show the GOP she's a team player, but she didn't do herself or the party any favors by standing by a colleague who spoke to a group whose membership would no doubt be happy if segregation had never ended. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Scalise made a ""mistake."" Speaker John Boehner, for his part, called it an ""error of judgment"" and added that Scalise has his ""full confidence."" Nonsense. As a black Republican, I'm tired of my party continuing to provide safe harbor to people like Scalise. Gingrich complained the media's coverage of Scalise's speech was ""a one-sided view of reality."" Actually, that sounds more like a description of the GOP today. The face of the party looks as intolerant as ever as 2015 begins. Unless it starts showing ""representatives"" like Scalise the door, it will find itself writing another autopsy report in 2016.","Crystal Wright: Steve Scalise scandal a reminder of GOP's race problems .

"Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on Friday outlined actions -- some under way, some in the works -- to revamp the U.S. nuclear program, following reviews he had ordered that ""found evidence of systemic problems."" ""We must address all of the underlying problems,"" Hagel said, pointing to ""sometimes insufficient resources and manpower,"" among many other issues. An internal review pointed to a host of problems, from ""inadequate"" and ""aging"" equipment and facilities to ""a culture of excessive inspections"" to the blurring of the lines between accountability and perfection in the Air Force,"" according to a summary released by the Defense Department. This report, and a separate external review, pointed to ""a nuclear workforce that was dedicated, capable, and performing well in spite of challenges resulting from being understaffed, under-resourced, and reliant on an aging and fragile supporting infrastructure in an over-inspected and overly risk-averse environment,"" the Defense Department summary said. ""Both reports identified serious issues with potential real world consequences if not addressed -- some of which require long term and permanent cultural and structural changes,"" the Defense Department added. Hagel ordered the review in January following revelations of misconduct involving officers who played a role in the nuclear program. The incidents included the disciplining of a general with nuclear oversight responsibilities; his misbehavior involving alcohol and women on an overseas trip got him into hot water. There was also the disclosure that nearly three dozen Air Force officers at a nuclear missile base in Montana were involved in cheating on a proficiency test. In his remarks Friday, Hagel noted that while President Barack Obama's administration is moving away from reliance on nuclear weapons, that arsenal remains a key part of the U.S. military. ""It's (the Department of Defense's) highest-priority mission,"" Hagel said. ""No other capability we have is more important."" Military nuke officers beset by recent scandals . Together, the two reviews identified over 100 recommendations to improve the nation's nuclear deterrent forces ranging for acquisition investments to leadership challenges. In one instance, the review panels discovered a situation where crews working on the missile fleet relied on Fed-Ex to deliver the copy of one wrench, needed to attach warheads to missiles, to be shared among three bases. Hagel called the situation ""indicative of a system that's been allowed to kind of slowly back downhill,"" but also noted the ""creative and innovative"" nature of the solution. ""We now have a wrench for each location,"" Hagel said. ""We're going to have two wrenches for each location soon."" While the reviews concluded that the nation's nuclear facilities can fulfill their overall mission, significant changes will be required in the system to ensure the safety, security and overall effectiveness of the force in the future. ""The bottom line is that the forces are meeting the demands of the mission with dedication and determination but with such increasing difficulty that any margin of capability to meet the demands has been consumed by the Sailors, Airmen, and Marines are paying an unsustainable price,"" Air Force Gen. Larry Welch (Ret.) and Navy Admiral John Harvey, Jr. (Ret.) wrote in a letter to Hagel in a letter accompanying their external review report. Regarding personnel at nuclear facilities, the report found issues with accountability, morale and recognition, as well as a rapidly aging civilian workforce in some areas, and a lack of promotion opportunities for nuclear officers in the Air Force. The reports also found that as the nuclear infrastructure continues to age, it will be increasingly more time-consuming and expensive to sustain without additional investments. In his remarks, Hagel said he expected the need for a 10 percent increase for the nation's nuclear infrastructure in the next five budget requests each fiscal year.  Currently, the Pentagon spends in the range of $15-16 billion dollars a year Hagel said. Both reports call for a clarification of the leadership structure within the nuclear enterprise to reduce administrative burdens imposed on the forces, as well as a change in the ""culture of micromanagement,"" and improving the manner in which training and inspections are conducted. They come in the wake of a string of scandals over the past few years. In January, dozens of Air Force officers at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana charged with maintaining nuclear missiles, were accused of cheating or turning a blind eye to cheating on a competency test. That incident followed an October 2013 incident where a U.S. general who oversaw nuclear weapons being relieved of his position following revelations of public intoxication and disrespecting his hosts during an official visit to Russia. In another 2013 incident, 17 officers at Minot Air Force Base were stripped of their authority to control and launch nuclear missiles after their unit performed poorly on an inspection, with one officer investigated for potential compromise of nuclear launch codes. Secretary Hagel flew to Minot on Friday to visit with troops and crews and explain the findings of the reports. Hagel also announced he has granted the Air Force the authority to elevate it's Global Strike Command to be headed by a four-star general and to allow a three-star general to oversee the strategic deterrence and nuclear integration staff. That was a recommendation made by Air Force Secretary Deborah James, along with members of Congress earlier this year, who said the missions deserved higher level of leadership. ""We must restore the prestige that attracted the brightest minds of the Cold War era, so our most talented young men and women see the nuclear pathway as promising in value,"" Hagel said.  ""They will no longer be outranked by their non-nuclear counterparts, giving the nuclear Air Force the second-to-none leadership it deserves.""","Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel ordered a review of the U.S. nuclear program .

"The G20 is in town and with it comes sacred flames, security bans, street protests and a bizarre front page depiction of world leaders in various states of undress. The Australian city of Brisbane arguably hasn't seen this much excitement since World Expo '88 transformed a derelict strip of industrial land into a sprawling souvenir shop and later an inner city beach. Preparations have been underway for more than two years, since ex-Prime Minister Julia Gillard's former Labor government proposed the city as a venue for the world's largest and most influential economic talks. Current Prime Minister Tony Abbott has sworn that this G20 ""will not be a talkfest."" Still, over the next few days, political pundits will be scrutinizing the words, actions and gestures of at least 25 world leaders for hints at future policy. While they do, here are few lesser-known facts about Brisbane's G20. 1. There's a sacred ceremonial fire . At least, we hope there is. Last week, firefighters responded to a 000 call -- Australia's version of 911 -- to report an open fire in the city's Musgrave Park near the G20 center. Officers duly put it out, only to be confronted by angry Aboriginal elders of the Jagera tribe who had lit the sacred ceremonial flame for G20, according to ABC reporter Michael James. ""They accosted the firefighters, yelling at them, a fair bit of swearing, accusing them of deliberately attempting to extinguish the fire as they knew that it was their sacred fire,"" James told CNN. The embers used to light the blaze came from the fire burning at the Aboriginal Tent Embassy in Canberra, the headquarters of a long campaign for recognition and compensation for the theft of Aboriginal land. During a march through the city on Monday, activists stopped in the middle of the street and broke into traditional dance, James said. More protests are planned during G20. 2. Banned: Eggs, stones, insects . If you thought about taking your lizard for a walk through inner city Brisbane this week think again. ""A reptile, insect, or other animal capable of causing physical harm if released in close proximity to a person"" are banned from key areas of the city, according to the government's G20 security law. You can't carry an egg, stone, metal cans, tins or glass bottles, and especially not ones that contain urine or manure, which are also on the banned list. Of course, crossbows are out and it would be best to leave your whips at home. 3. Step away from the mayonnaise . The threat of terrorism may be on the minds of police chiefs, but the state's top doctor has said she's more worried about egg mayonnaise. Local caterers are expecting to prepare around 100,000 meals for delegates, media and police over the two-day event, creating a potential Salmonella minefield. ""We've seen quite a few outbreaks in Queensland over the last few years, mainly due to raw eggs,"" Dr. Jeannette Young told The Australian. ""My personal view is we should all shy away from raw egg mayonnaise at all times,"" she said. 4. Cheese please . U.S. President Obama is known to love a cheese burger, which is presumably why Brisbane Airport's Windmill & Co. has created the Big Obama Burger. Either that or they fancied some free publicity. The towering burger includes two Angus beef patties, cheese (of course), onions, onion rings, spinach, tomato, cucumbers and mustard. Fans of local burger delicacies, beetroot and pineapple, will have to look elsewhere. 5.  Mind the signs . A row has erupted over signs at Brisbane Airport, which would have been some of the first images delegates saw as they make their way through arrivals. The rejected slogans, submitted by Civil Society 20 (C20) and Transparency International included: ""If corruption was an industry it would be the world's third largest."" And ""Women comprise 70% of the world's poor."" Brisbane Airport tweeted: ""We don't accept any political ads, whether from parties, cause based organizations or individuals, regardless of issue/message."" C20 spokesman John Lindsay said: ""It's a sad day for Australia if talking about inequality, climate change or corruption are deemed too political."" The airport is offering a billboard of world leaders to satisfy demands for selfies. 6.  Still at the airport... Possibly the people most excited about G20 right now are about 120 plane spotters who are at Brisbane Airport eagerly awaiting the arrival of planes never before seen the country. ""The mood is excellent. People are excited about these aircraft visiting and how it puts Brisbane on the map in a global sense,"" Beau Chenery from PlaneImages.net told CNN. ""Some of these aircraft will probably never visit Brisbane again so it really is a one in a lifetime opportunity for aviation photographers."" The most anticipated touchdowns are President Putin's Ilyushin Il-96 and Obama's Air Force One. ""Everyone's hoping for Air Force One but it probably won't happen,"" plane spotter Daniel Vorbach told the ABC. ""I'd be ecstatic. That would be the pinnacle of everything.""","Away from G20 talks, protests, planes attract attention in Brisbane .

"While House Republicans say every option -- including a government shutdown -- is on the table to counter President Barack Obama's planned executive action on immigration, Colorado Sen.-elect Cory Gardner said shutting down the government is something a ""mature governing body"" shouldn't even consider. ""There's no time, place or purpose of a government shutdown or default,"" Gardner said Friday on MSNBC's Morning Joe. ""That's simply ridiculous and something that a mature governing body doesn't even contemplate. We ought to make it very clear that that's simply not acceptable."" Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said shutting down the government or defaulting on the U.S.'s debt obligations are completely off the table. But House Speaker John Boehner has been under pressure from the conservative faction of his caucus to tie the President's executive actions to the fate of the government spending bill needed to fund federal agencies by mid-December. On Friday, Gardner, currently a member of the House, said members of Congress need to work together and with the President to make comprehensive immigration reform a reality. Gardner said Republicans should counter the president's planned action with a plan of their own. ""To simply say no to everything is unacceptable,"" Gardner said. ""But I think the President also needs to do the right thing and work with Congress."" Could immigration cause another government shutdown? Asked about reports that Republicans could consider suing the President over his coming executive order, Gardner urged more bipartisanship, which he suggested was the message voters sent at the polls this month. ""Instead of charging each other with lawsuits or litigation or executive orders or abuses of powers, why don't we actually do what the American people sent us to do. Let's work together, let's be the grownups in the room. That's what they hope that Washington is,"" Gardner said. While the midterm results appeared to bring Obama and GOP leaders in Congress to the table -- and in fact did as they lunched together at the White House -- the spirit of bipartisanship appears to have already soured as Obama stood firm on his pledge to take executive action on immigration by the end of the year and following the announcement of a climate deal with China.","Rep.

"A Sikh student at Hofstra University filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the United States Army, claiming the service refused to grant him a religious accommodation that would allow him to enlist in his school's ROTC program without shaving his beard, cutting his hair and removing his turban, according to court documents. When Iknoor Singh requested a religious exemption from the military's grooming policies to enlist as an ROTC cadet in April 2013, his request was first denied on the grounds that his noncompliance would have ""an adverse impact on the Army's readiness, unit cohesion, standards, health, safety, or discipline,"" court documents said. The Army subsequently adjusted its decision, saying Singh could only seek an exemption after he was enlisted as a cadet -- creating a catch-22 in which Singh would have to violate his faith to be able to apply for a religious accommodation, the documents said. ""I couldn't believe the military was asking me to make the impossible decision of choosing between the country I love and my faith,"" Singh said in a blog post on the ACLU's website. The lawsuit, filed jointly by the ACLU and United Sikhs, which describes itself as a U.N.-affiliated nonprofit organization, claims that the Army's denial of religious exemption violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. As a practicing Sikh, Singh maintains certain articles of faith, including 'kesh,' which the court documents describe as ""rooted in the belief that allowing hair to grow naturally is a sign of respect toward the perfection of God's creation."" The court documents continue: ""Like most Sikhs, Mr. Singh believes that the turban is an inseparable part of his Sikh religious identity and that exposing his ""naked"" head in public, as Defendants would require upon his enlistment, would be sacrilegious and shameful."" Singh was born and raised in Queens, New York, and has dreams of serving as a military intelligence officer, according to court documents. A sophomore at the Hempstead, New York, university, Singh is a finance major and audits the ROTC military-science coursework as an unenlisted member of the program, according to court documents. In a statement, Hofstra University said it ""entirely supports Mr. Singh's ambitions to serve his country. He is currently enrolled in the ROTC class and we are providing him leadership training to the extent that the U.S. Army has allowed. We very much hope that the Army will permit us to enroll Mr. Singh in the program as a full Cadet."" The Army has allowed religious exemptions to its grooming and dress regulations for Sikhs in the past. A 2010 news article published on the Army's website described the accommodation that was allowed to Capt. Tejdeep Singh Rattan and Capt. Kamaljeet Singh Kalsi, both Sikhs. ""The Army does allow personnel to request waivers for practices that may conflict with current Army regulations and policies and are considered on a case-by-case basis,"" the article said. A spokeswoman for the Army did not have a comment available on exemptions to its grooming policy available at the time of the publication of this article. In September, the Army adjusted its grooming policies to allow female soldiers to wear braids, cornrows and twists in their hair -- a policy shift that resulted from a public petition that called the ban ""racially biased.""","Hofstra student is denied a religious exemption .

"Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer called President Barack Obama's planned executive action on immigration ""impeachable."" ""I believe it is an impeachable offense,"" Krauthammer said Wednesday night on Fox News, when asked about Obama's reported proposals to use executive orders to make changes to the immigration system. Krauthammer added that Obama's plans to shield certain undocumented immigrants from deportation via executive order would be a ""flagrant assault on the Constitution."" Krauthammer's remarks could revive talk of impeachment in conservative circles, months after former Gov. Sarah Palin sparked a firestorm this summer when she called for Obama's impeachment after he first announced his plans to use his executive order power to act on immigration reform. ""It's time to impeach,"" Palin wrote in a Breitbart op-ed in July. ""The many impeachable offenses of Barack Obama can no longer be ignored. If after all this he's not impeachable, then no one is."" Democrats jumped on those comments this summer to force GOP leaders to address the possibility of impeachment and, ultimately, reject that possibility. The House of Representatives instead voted this summer to approve plans for a lawsuit against Obama for overreaching on changes to the Affordable Care Act. Could immigration cause another government shutdown? Even Krauthammer conceded this summer that impeachment would be ""political suicide"" for Republicans. For many tea party conservatives, Obama's executive action plans on immigration reform were the last straw in a long line of grievances of what they claim to be executive overreach since Obama has been in office. Others who have called for Obama's impeachment or said it should be strongly considered include conservative firebrand Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann and tea party favorite Rep. Steve King of Iowa among others.","Charles Krauthammer called Obama's plans for immigration order 'impeachable'

"A 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck just over 150 kilometers (93 miles) northwest off the coast of Ternate, Indonesia, on Saturday, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The quake struck at 10:31 a.m. local time at a depth of 35 kilometers (21.7 miles), according to the USGS, which initially called it a 7.3-magnitude quake. It was centered 156 kilometers east-northeast of Bitung, Indonesia, and 164 kilometers west of Tobelo in the same South Asian nation. The National Weather Service's Pacific Tsunami Warning Center noted that the quake did not produce any destructive tsunami waves, though minor sea level fluctuations in some coastal areas were possible.","The USGS downgrades the quake's strength to a 7.1-magnitude .

"In the cultural haven of Chiang Mai, the temples and religious reverence is what you'd expect. But look closer and you'll find the edgy charm of a modern city, from the cafes populated by digital nomads to artists and creatives. And somehow much of it is expressed with a wink and a nod to the noble Lanna Kingdom, the historical roots of Northern Thailand. Katie Jade Hawker, a curator and artist from Britain came to Chiang Mai a few years ago to connect artists worldwide with the unique creative energy of the city. ""I think they've got a lot of amazing culture to select inspiration from, and there's a lot of artwork produced with kind of underlying Buddhist influences touching on Thai tradition,"" she says. There is also a practical side to all this creativity; a campaign in Chiang Mai to give this city a UNESCO Creative City designation. Nopporn Kaewnew, the head of Don Designs, says that getting his furniture pieces to a wider clientele would be much more difficult without the Creative Chiang Mai campaign.

"Prosecutors in the Mexican state of Guerrero said Friday they have formally charged former Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca in the disappearance of 43 students. Abarca is described as the ""probable mastermind"" in the September 26 disappearance of the students. He is charged with six counts of aggravated homicide and one count of attempted homicide, the state attorney's office said. Authorities said the students -- mostly men in their 20s studying to be teachers -- were abducted by police in September at Abarca's direction. Police killed some students, and the rest are believed to have been turned over to gang members to be executed, Mexican Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam has said. The men's bodies were burned, and some remains were thrown in a river. The students were traveling to Iguala to protest a lack of funding for their school. Officials have said that Abarca ordered the city's police chief to stop the demonstration out of concern it would disrupt one of his own events. Opinion: Mexico kidnappings: Outrage isn't going away . In all, at least 74 people have been arrested in connection with the disappearances and deaths, which have sparked huge protests across Mexico.

"Google's new driverless-car prototype is downright hugable. The company unveiled its latest self-driving vehicle on Monday, and it looks like a cartoon koala crossed with a smart car wearing a fez. Unlike the mock-up car Google first shared in May, this version is fully functional. It even has real headlights. The round, white and gray car is designed without permanent driving tools like a gas pedal or wheel. However, to comply with California state law, there are still removable, temporary controls for the required ""safety driver"" -- a real person who needs to be in the car and ready to take over in an emergency. The goal is to eventually remove any interior controls so that passengers can take a nap or knit while the car does all the work. Google's self-driving car team will continue to test the vehicle on a private track in California, where it works its way around traffic lights and mock construction zones. Google has said it's interested in launching a pilot program for the cars in the coming years. When the tech company first started experimenting with self-driving technology, it modified existing cars, like a Toyota, Audi and Lexus, by adding multiple cameras and sensors and an onboard computer. Now Google has moved on to making its own car from scratch. The car's dome-like shape is optimal for giving sensors the widest field of view. A car could help put people's minds at ease about the controversial technology. Before self-driving cars can start ferrying us to work, companies need figure out ethical issues (does it hit a deer or crash into the median?), improve basic driving functions, and work with governments on legislation to allow driverless cars on all roads. Google is just one of many companies developing driverless car technology. Universities and major auto manufacturers such as BMW and Mercedes are working on similar vehicles. Google hopes to have its version on the road by the end of the decade.","Google debuted its new, fully functioning driverless car prototype .

"(CNN)As CNN presents an encore of Roger Ebert's dramatic story ""Life Itself,"" on Friday at 9 p.m. ET, it may strike you how Oscar-nominated director Steve James sprinkles surprising details about the late movie reviewer's life throughout the film. A lot of folks already know that Ebert wrote the screenplay for the 1970 cult classic ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls."" They also may remember years ago when he outed himself as a recovering alcoholic. And when Ebert and Gene Siskel launched their TV review show in the 1970s, most people know they didn't get along at first. ""Life Itself,"" includes a Siskel-Ebert squabble so snarky it'll make you squirm with discomfort. The move reminds us that the fame of someone like Ebert, who lost his battle with cancer in 2013, may fool us into thinking we knew him almost like a friend or a neighbor down the street. But of course fame has always been good at casting illusions. ""Life Itself"" jabs viewers with the realization that there were aspects of Roger we knew nothing about. The private details about Ebert in the film paint a warts-and-all portrait of a man who clearly lived a pretty fulfilling and interesting life. With that in mind, here are five facts from the film that may take you by surprise: . 1. Ebert's drinking years: The 'hired lady' Ebert's longtime friend, writer William Knack, shares this story in the film: ""I met Roger one time with a woman that looked like a young Linda Ronstadt ... I said, 'who is that?' And he said, 'she's a hired lady.' And I said, 'a hooker?' And he said, 'Now, you take care of her when I leave.' And he left town."" 2. He suspected his cancer was linked to radiation treatments. ""My disease may have been started by childhood radiation treatments for an ear infection,"" said Ebert in the film. 3. Siskel hung out with Playboy founder Hugh Hefner's inner circle. ""Gene was more of a — for lack of a better word —  an elegant character,"" Siskel's widow, Marlene Iglitzen said in the film. ""He caught the eye of Hugh Hefner and he was adopted by the clan at the [Playboy] Mansion. And he traveled with Hefner in the Bunny Jet. Even though Roger wrote 'Beyond the Valley of the Dolls,' I think Gene lived the life for a while."" Take the quiz: How 'Ebert are you? 4. Siskel -- who died in 1999 -- hid his terminal brain cancer from Ebert until his final days. ""He didn't really want the [TV show producers] at Disney to know how sick he was. ... and Roger didn't know. And that really wounded Roger,"" said Ebert's ex-producer Thea Flaum in the film. ""I don't think it's that he didn't trust Roger personally. Nonetheless when something like that happens, you take it personally. How else is there to take it?"" Eventually Ebert learned Siskel was sick. But it was too late. Ebert's widow Chaz Ebert said the timing was tragic. ""I was so sad for Roger for not being able to tell his 'brother' goodbye. ... We were going to go and visit him that Monday, but he passed away that Saturday."" 5. A chance meeting with Ebert helped inspire a girl to grow up to be a movie director. When she was 8 or 9, Ava DuVernay's aunt took her to see a rehearsal for the Oscars in Hollywood. When she spotted Ebert, she recognized him from TV. ""I remember saying, 'Thumbs up! Thumbs up!' ... And he came over. The two posed for a quick snapshot. After DuVernay directed her first film years later, Ebert's review ""really got to the heart of what I was trying to articulate,"" she said in the documentary. ""The film was about my aunt who took me to the Oscars that day ... and about losing someone that you love. Ebert's review touched me so much that I sent him the picture from the Oscars."" Later, Ebert honored DuVernay's aunt in a heartfelt blog post. DuVernay went on to direct the 2014 hit film, ""Selma."" Related: 'Selma' star's incredible transformation .

"Women lounge in designer bikinis next to glistening infinity pools. Young men race their latest Porsches and Maseratis, their wrists draped in gold jewelry. Partygoers take sips from bottles of bubbly inside plush mansions. The photos could be of the young, high-society crowd in Beverly Hills, New York or Miami. But looks can be deceiving. Meet the ""Rich Kids of Tehran,"" a social media phenomenon that has attracted worldwide attention for offering a startling glimpse at the decadent lifestyle of wealthy young Iranians in one of the world's most socially conservative countries. After launching in September on Instagram, the mobile photo-sharing platform, @RichKidsofTehran quickly amassed more than 100,000 followers by posting hundreds of pictures of fast luxury cars, house parties in gated neighborhoods and attractive young women in slinky dresses. The account, a spinoff of the original U.S.-based hit @RichKidsofInstagram, also has showcased people drinking what appears to be alcohol and young women flouting Muslim custom by not wearing hijabs, or head scarves. Alcohol has been strictly forbidden in the country since the 1979 Iranian Revolution, and laws mandate that women dress modestly and keep their hair covered with a hijab while in public -- although it appears that most of the Instagram photos were taken on private property. In a post that has since been deleted, the account's creators defended their photos and the idea behind them. ""We have changed the way the world looks at us,"" they wrote in the post, which was widely shared by media outlets before it was pulled. ""People (in Iran) don't use camels for transportation but some choose to use 'Italian and German horses.' ""We did not have any bad intentions and we are not against anyone. We wanted to show the luxurious side of Tehran to the world."" One social media expert has a slightly different interpretation. ""There are conservative elements in Iran that would frown upon these images because they show young people in bikinis and others drinking alcohol. What I see are images of kids who are rebelling against the social norms that they grew up with,"" said Jamie Turner, co-author of ""How to Make Money with Social Media"" and CEO of 60 Second Marketer. ""Instagram is really a megaphone for people in repressed social and political environments to stand up and say, 'I'm here, I'm alive, and I want to rebel against the social and cultural values of my parents' generation,'"" Turner said. That megaphone was silenced somewhat when the @RichKidsofTehran account was shut down in October, just a month after it launched. Although the Iranian government has tried to block access to social media sites in the past, there's no evidence that happened in this case. Only Instagram, or one of its users, can delete an individual account. A spokesperson for Instagram confirmed that the account is no longer active. The spokesperson would not comment further about the account and referred CNN to Instagram's policy that includes rules against posting unauthorized photos. ""When we receive an intellectual property infringement claim from a rights' owner, we take appropriate action, which could include removal of the content,"" the policy states. But @RichKidsofTehran would not die. The original inspired a number of copycat accounts, all showing young affluent partyers purporting to live in Iran. Some of the accounts attract thousands of followers and are still active. Not long after the original account was shut down, it apparently resurfaced with a new name: @RichKidsofTeh. Its creators sent a Twitter message referring fans to the new Instagram account, which now credits the person who took the photos. Meanwhile, the identity of whoever was behind the original account remains a mystery. CNN sent messages to the email address listed on the account and received some cryptic responses. ""We are putting our lives at danger for this,"" said one message. ""You can record my voice ... God knows what can happen to me,"" said another, in response to a request for a phone interview. The respondent agreed to phone CNN at an appointed time, but the call never came. When CNN later sent an email asking whether the account's creators had posted content without people's permission, we received this response: ""You think your (sic) clever don't you. NO COMMENT.""","""Rich Kids of Tehran"" is a popular Instagram account showing wealthy young Iranians .

"Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a longtime friend of the Clinton family, thinks the former Secretary of State will decide whether she'll run for president in 60 days. ""She's got to make that decision and she's got to spend the next 60 days making that decision ... I'm really hoping she runs, but I'm leaving that decision to her,"" McAuliffe told U.S. News & World Report on Thursday. The Virginia governor's projection means Clinton will have made up her mind by mid-January 2015, which matches the time frame Clinton said she plans to make her widely anticipated decision. ""I am going to be making a decision around, probably after the first of the year about whether I am going to run again,"" she told a Mexican audience in early September. When asked whether his close ties to Clinton would land him the VP spot, McAuliffe said he's ""just happy to support her."" The former chairman of Clinton's failed 2008 campaign isn't the only one anticipating her announcement. John Podesta, Bill Clinton's former chief of staff and current Obama adviser, told PBS' Al Hunt on Friday that he will join Hillary's campaign if she asks.

"(CNN)Sharp angles, fragmented glass, scaffolding, bright lights, looming robotics -- these elements tower over ghostly, apparition-like people scurrying to and from their destinations. In these images, amid bustling city of Tokyo, the overflow of people looks almost like rushing water -- no more than a fleeting presence. In a generation where photographs are taken to establish a person's presence, marking where they are, where they've been and whom they were with, photographer Matthew Pillsbury's work takes a different approach.  The people in his work have an evanescent quality. ""The fact that the static elements, the city, the spaces, remain sharp, but the people are the ones fading -- it certainly is something that makes us question how our time is finite and how are we spending that time,"" says Pillsbury. It is this very transient, otherworldly aspect of photography that's captivated him. ""When using longer exposures I'm also capturing something that is only visible in a photograph, but yet we know it to be fundamentally true."" Pillsbury, born to American parents in France, has had a deep-seated love for cultural exchange and expressing that through the medium of photography. This art form he says, allows him to capture a ""given period of time in a single image, and in doing so it allows us a reflection that's just a different experience."" Reflection is exactly what Pillsbury has been achieving with his work for over the past decade. On crowded city streets, a long exposure will only capture those who stand still for a moment.  With the clear implications of mortality in his imagery, Pillsbury stresses the importance of asking questions with his art as opposed to offering a solution or supplying answers. Many of his previous works have focused on the use of technology in modern life and our interaction with humanity as a result.  The project Tokyo, which was recently featured in the Benrubi gallery in New York, took a different look at technology as the landscape in which people move around. What drew Pillsbury to Tokyo was the dichotomy of a culture that was caught in a dance between past and present: Holding onto traditions, ancient temples, festivals and ceremonies while embracing technology and modernism. Places like Robot Bar, are standard in the city. Pillsbury describes the scene as a restaurant mixed with a rock concert and a nightclub. This loud, boisterous environment is a magnet for the younger generations. Yet the older customs and generations still have a large influence. The two worlds collide when the cherry blossoms bloom. When the winter breaks and warm air is ushered in, and the first cherry blossoms bloom, an announcement goes out in the paper, marking the countdown till full bloom.  And then the city stops everything else to focus with eager anticipation on preparing for the festivities. During full bloom all generations are accounted for -- out meandering on sidewalks and picnicking on the lawn. Throngs of people are greeted by lanterns hanging from scaffolding at the first Hanami. Even in the pouring rain the festivities continue, and as the blossoms fall from the trees, people stop to clap.  Those that stop to soak in the moment are the only ones that appear sharp in Pillsbury's photographs. When capturing moments like this, Pillsbury is guided by the available light.  ""What I love about using long exposures is that there is only so much I can anticipate about what the actual result is going to look like and the fact that I still am often surprised by the result is part of the magic to me."" Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. The element of surprise makes a shot more compelling for Pillsbury -- reacting to the reality around him, instead of forcing his ideas onto the landscape. While most of photography is about asserting a human presence, the poeticism of Pillsbury's work is that it echoes our sense of time passing. Matthew Pillsbury is an American photographer based in New York. He is represented by Benrubi Gallery.","Photographer Matthew Pillsbury took long exposure photographs using only available light .

"A sudden tragedy brings out the best in the media: journalists racing to the scene, ferreting out the details, leading the nation through its grief. It also brings out the worst. In the fragmentary accounts that followed Friday's horrifying massacre at a Connecticut school, some news organizations, following in the tracks of social media, managed to identify the wrong man as the shooter. And then television provided a platform for the instantaneous finger-pointing and point-scoring that all too often follows such shootings. I am conflicted when I watch the instant network specials, led by top anchors and featuring theme music and fancy logos, as I did after Columbine, after Virginia Tech, after Tucson, after Aurora. Of course they want to devote time and resources to a major national story. But it also feels at times like a branding exercise, an effort to grab ratings share after a heartbreaking event. I am conflicted as well at watching some journalists interview children who saw the carnage. I understand their value as eyewitnesses, but these are young kids who had just been through a terrible trauma. To me, at least, it feels exploitative. Some organizations, including CNN, require the parents' permission, but it is not clear that all outlets followed such a policy in the scramble that followed the shootings. I was not conflicted at all when I read that a Hartford Courant reporter called the shooter's grandmother in Florida. ""I just don't know, and I can't make a comment right now,"" Dorothy Hanson, 78, said in a shaky voice as she started to cry. I fail to see what that added to our understanding of the tragedy. Watch: Jon Stewart, media critic, takes on Fox . The worst offense, though, was the headlong rush to identify the shooter as Ryan Lanza, 24, and blast his Facebook profile picture around cyberspace. CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, CBS, Slate, the Huffington Post and others named Ryan Lanza as the suspect, some of them based on guidance from law enforcement sources. In this wired age, his name was bandied about on Twitter and in other social media forums. The news outlets had to correct their reports when it turned out that the shooter was 20-year-old Adam Lanza, his brother, who first killed their mother. But they had suggested that an innocent man was responsible for murdering 27 people, including 20 children. What's more, most reports erroneously said Lanza's mother taught at the Newtown elementary school (a mistake I initially repeated as well). Watch: From Joe Scarborough to Rush Limbaugh, the conservative media meltdown . Blogger Jeff Jarvis, who teaches journalism at the City University of New York, expressed regret for retweeting information about Ryan Lanza, although Jarvis did not use his name: ""I did not say this was the 'alleged' or 'reputed' account of the person named as the killer. These are basic, basic journalistic skills drilled until they are reflexes and I would use them in any story for print. I didn't use them online."" Not everyone was as candid in confessing their mistakes. The rush to judgment is hardly an isolated incident. After an Arizona gunman last year killed six people and wounded Gabby Giffords, some news organizations erroneously reported that the congresswoman was dead. After the Aurora shooting this past summer in a theater showing a Batman movie, ABC's Brian Ross told viewers the suspect was linked to the Colorado tea party before apologizing for reporting on someone with the same name. Watch: Is 'Zero Dark Thirty' tortured history or propaganda? After Friday's violence, there was an instinct by some in the media to pound away at their favorite positions. Mike Huckabee said on Fox News: ""We ask why there is violence in our schools, but we've systematically removed God from our schools."" I respect the former Arkansas governor, but Friday did not seem like the time for such a statement. At the same time, Rush Limbaugh ripped MSNBC's Alex Wagner and CNN's Piers Morgan for saying the massacre pointed up the need for stricter gun control. ""You've got a horrible event here, and they're already looking to politicize it. ... These people look at stuff like this as an opportunity to advance their agenda or blame conservatives."" (The three guns, including an assault rifle, used by Adam Lanza were legally registered to his mother.) All this is reminiscent of what happened to NBC's Bob Costas when he used a halftime commentary to question the gun culture in this country after an NFL player was involved in a murder-suicide. Costas was attacked from the right for daring to inject a serious issue into a sporting event. Watch: The media fixate on Hillary and 2016, again . Except in the days following a mass shooting, the media seem to shy away from a serious debate over gun control, perhaps fearing that it is too divisive and will alienate a broad swath of readers and viewers. The mainstream press operates under the assumption that Congress will never pass a gun-control measure because of the NRA's clout and therefore the matter isn't much worth pursuing. The issue was barely mentioned in the presidential campaign, and journalists made no attempt to force it onto the national agenda. The same thing will happen after Newtown inevitably fades from the newscasts and the front pages, and the gun question disappears until the next big tragedy forces us to revisit it once again.

"Two Americans and a German won the Nobel Prize in chemistry this year for their work on optical microscopy that has opened up our understanding of molecules by allowing us to see how they work close up. The winners are Eric Betzig, Stefan W. Hell and William E. Moerner, the Nobel committee in Sweden announced Wednesday. Back in 1873, science believed it had reached a limit in how much more of a detailed picture a microscope could provide. At the time, microscopist Ernst Abbe said the maximum resolution had been attained. This year's winners proved that contention wrong. Physics Nobel Prize goes to scientists who perfected LED light . ""Due to their achievements, the optical microscope can now peer into the nanoworld,"" the committee said. The importance can't be overemphasized: Now, scientists can see how proteins in fertilized eggs divide into embryos, or they can track proteins involved in Alzheimer's or Parkinson's diseases, the committee said. Hell, of the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, GÃ¶ttingen, and German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, both in Germany, developed a way to use two laser beams to make individual molecules glow on and off. Speaking to the Nobel committee by phone after the prize was announced, Hell said the development of nanoscopy was ""very important to life scientists"" because the use of focused light is the only way to see how the body works at a cellular level. He said he was ""totally surprised"" by the call from the Nobel committee and that it took a while for the news to sink in. Betzig, of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, in Ashburn, Virginia, and Moerner, of Stanford University in California, worked separately to develop the basis for single-molecule microscopy. Medicine Nobel Prize goes for work on cells that form brain's GPS system . This uses light to make individual molecules glow and allows a dense super-image to be resolved at the nanolevel. Committee chairman Sven Lidin said that thanks to their development of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, cells could be studied close up and the boundary between chemistry and biology had blurred. ""Guesswork has turned into hard facts and obscurity has turned into clarity,"" he added. Last year's prize in chemistry rewarded three scientists, Martin Karplus, Michael Levitt and Arieh Warshel, for work leading to the computer programs used today to predict the outcomes of very complex chemical reactions.","Committee head: ""Guesswork has turned into hard facts and obscurity... into clarity""

"A week after the death of Brazilian presidential candidate Eduardo Campos in a plane accident, his running mate Marina Silva announced she would replace him on the ticket, setting the stage for a tighter race. The announcement was widely expected, and a poll released Monday showed that Silva, a well-known environmentalist, had a better chance of defeating President Dilma Rousseff in the Oct. 5 elections than Campos would have. After a lengthy meeting with members of Campos' Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB), Silva, a former senator and environmental minister, was applauded and cheered at a news conference in Brasilia. ""Without Eduardo we have what always united us: the awareness of where we want to go together,"" she said. Campos was polling a distant third before his death last Wednesday. The latest figures from the survey group Datafolha showed Rousseff still in the lead with 36% of the vote. But Silva was in second place with 21%, while the center-right candidate Aecio Neves had slipped to third with 20%. That would mean a run-off vote in which, according to the poll, Silva would garner 47% of the ballots, compared with 43% for Rousseff. While the figures likely reflect a sympathy vote following Campos' tragic accident, the numbers are worrying for the governing Workers Party. At the news conference on Wednesday, the PSB also announced that Congressman Beto Albuquerque would be Silva's running mate. Silva unsuccessfully ran for president in 2010 for the country's Green Party. She told the crowd Wednesday that she arrived with ""a sense of responsibility, of commitment assumed during the last 10 months of intense work, ready to honor the commitment and go forward with all of those that were building a project with Eduardo.""","Socialist Party candidate Eduardo Campos was killed last week in a plane crash .

"You may know where you are and where you're going to, but do you know why you know that? The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has honored three neuroscientists, whose work is helping answer that question. John O'Keefe, along with May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser, discovered cells that form a positioning system in the brain -- our hard-wired GPS. Those cells mark our position, navigate where we're going and help us remember it all, so that we can repeat our trips, the Nobel Assembly said in a statement. Nobel Prizes: Medical award kicks off week of announcements . Alzheimer's insights . Their research could also prove useful in Alzheimer's research, because of the parts of the brain those cells lie in -- the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex. Humans and other mammals have two hippocampi, which lie in the inner core of the bottom of the brain and are responsible for memory and orientation. The entorhinal cortices share these functions and connect the hippocampi with the huge neocortex, the bulk of our gray matter. In Alzheimer's patients, those two brain components break down early on, causing sufferers to get lost more easily. Understanding how the brain's GPS works may help scientists in the future understand how this disorientation occurs. The research is also important, because it pinpoints ""a cellular basis for higher cognitive function,"" the Nobel Assembly said. The scientists conducted their research on rats, but other research on humans indicates that we have these same cells. Nerve cell discoveries . O'Keefe, a British neuroscientist who is also an American-born U.S. citizen, made the first discovery in 1971, when he came upon a nerve cell in the brain of a rat that was set off whenever the rat was in a particular place, the statement said. The scientist called them ""place cells."" In 2005, the Mosers, Norwegian neuroscientists, discovered yet another component. ""They identified another type of nerve cell, which they called 'grid cells,' that generate a coordinate system and allow for precise positioning and pathfinding,"" the statement read. They also later figured out how place and grid cells work together to make the brain know where it is and where it's headed. Oversimplified, one could say that the place cells mark point A and point B in the brain, and the grid cells help the brain get from point A to point B. The prize money of 8 million Swedish kronor ($1.2 million) took an interesting split. Half went to O'Keefe and half went jointly to the Mosers, who are a couple. It would seem to reflect the half-half nature of their discoveries. Nobel background . Monday's ceremony at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, will be followed by the announcement of the physics prize Tuesday, the chemistry prize Wednesday and the economics prize on October 13. The prize for literature will be awarded on a date to be announced later. The Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded Friday. Two Americans and a German shared the Nobel Prize in physiology last year. James E. Rothman and Randy W. Schekman, and German Thomas C. Sudhof were awarded the prize for discoveries of how the body's cells decide when and where to deliver the molecules they produce. Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel created the prizes in 1895 to honor work in physics, chemistry, literature and peace. The first economics prize was awarded in 1969.","Prize money took an interesting split: half went to a scientist, half to other 2 jointly .

"The Southern Plains of the United States are likely to see a continuation of a severe drought this winter, while the Pacific Northwest will be colder and wetter than average, according to data released Thursday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. La Nina is expected to influence weather patterns across the country for the second year in a row. Weather officials say with La Nina in place, Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and other surrounding states are unlikely to get enough rain to alleviate the ongoing drought. ""Ninety-one percent of Texas, 87 percent of Oklahoma and 63 percent of New Mexico are experiencing extreme or exceptional drought,"" said David Brown, director of the Southern Region Climate Services based in Fort Worth, Texas. Parts of Texas and Oklahoma are more than 30 inches below average in rainfall this year, with little in the forecast to predict the trend is going to change as the winter months approach. Agricultural losses in Texas have reached $5 billion in the past year, Brown said. Wildfires in 2011 have destroyed at least 3.5 million acres in the state. He also pointed out there are more than 600 separate water systems facing mandatory restrictions. Parts of Arizona, Kansas, Arkansas and Louisiana are also experiencing drought conditions. NOAA expects La Nina, which returned in August, to gradually strengthen and continue from December through February 2012. La Nina is associated with cooler than normal water temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean, which influences weather throughout the world.  It's the opposite of El Nino in which warmer ocean temperatures are seen in the same region. ""The evolving La Nina will shape this winter. La Nina is not going anywhere,"" said Mike Halpert, deputy director of NOAA's Climate Prediction Center. ""There is a wild card, though. The erratic Arctic oscillation can generate strong shifts in the climate patterns that could overwhelm or amplify La Nina's typical impacts."" Officials said the phenomenon could produce dramatic short-term swings in temperatures. While the opposing weather patterns are always present, it fluctuates between positive and negative phases, the agency said. The negative phase pushes cold air into the United States from Canada and can result in cold snaps and snowy conditions such as the ""snowmageddon"" storm of 2009, according to NOAA. The highlights of the U.S. winter outlook from NOAA include: . ■ Pacific Northwest: colder and wetter than average. La Nina often results in below-average temperatures and increased mountain snow in the Pacific Northwest and western Montana during the winter months. This may set the stage for spring flooding in the Missouri River Basin.■ California: colder than average with odds favoring wetter than average conditions in northern California and drier than average conditions in southern California. All of the southern part of the nation is at risk of having above normal wildfire conditions starting this winter and lasting into the spring.■ Northern Plains: colder and wetter than average. Spring flooding could be a concern in parts of this region.■ Southern Plains and Gulf Coast states: warmer and drier than average. This will likely exacerbate drought conditions in these regions.■ Florida and south Atlantic Coast: drier than average, with an equal chance for above-, near-, or below-normal temperatures. Above normal wildfire conditions.■ Ohio and Tennessee valleys: wetter than average with equal chances for above-, near-, or below-average temperatures. Potential for increased storminess and flooding.■ Northeast and Mid-Atlantic: equal chances for above-, near-, or below-normal temperatures and precipitation. Winter weather for these regions is often driven not by La Nina but by the Arctic oscillation. If enough cold air and moisture are in place, areas north of the Ohio Valley and into the Northeast could see above-average snow.■ Great Lakes: tilt toward colder and wetter than average.■ Hawaii: Above-average temperatures are favored in the western islands with equal chances of above-, near-, or below average precipitation. Statewide, the current drought is expected to continue through the winter. Drought recovery is more likely over the windward slopes of the Big Island and Maui.■ Alaska: colder than average over the southern half of the state and the panhandle with below average precipitation in the interior eastern part of the state. The seasonal outlook from NOAA does not project where and when snowstorms may hit, according to weather officials. The snow forecasts are dependent upon winter storms which are generally not predictable more than a week in advance, they said.","Strong Arctic weather patterns can overwhelm or amplify La Nina .
Drought conditions are expected to continue in the South and Southwest .
The Pacific Northwest will be wetter and colder than average ."
"Two scientists in Japan and one at the University of California at Santa Barbara were awarded this year's Nobel Prize in physics for helping create the LED light, a transformational and ubiquitous source that now lights up everything from our living rooms to our flashlights to our smart phones. The awarding committee said the trio's work is in keeping with the spirit of Alfred Nobel, the founder of the prize, because LED lights save on energy, last long and are environmentally-friendly because they don't contain mercury. They ""hold great promise for increasing the quality of life for over 1.5 billion people around the world who lack access to electricity grids,"" the awarding committee said. Specifically, Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano and Shuji Nakamura were honored for inventing the blue light emitting diode. Red and green diodes had been around for years. But when the three created the blue diodes in the early 1990s, only then could the white lamps that glow from every corner of our world be created. For 30 years, scientists had tried to create the blue diode. ""They triggered a fundamental transformation of lighting technology,""  the committee said. ""They succeeded where everyone else failed."" LED lights last longer and are more efficient than regular light bulbs and fluorescent lamps. Medicine Nobel Prize goes for work on cells that form brain's GPS system . Not prepared for it . Nakamura, a scientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said by phone that receiving the news that he had won the Nobel prize was ""unbelievable."" Akasaki and Amano are affiliated with Nagoya University in Japan. Amano was on a flight when the committee tried to call him so was not able to hear the news in advance of the news conference, the committee said. Staffan Normark, permanent secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, said that Nakamura and Akasaki had been thrilled to learn they were prize winners. ""I think they were not prepared for it. They had not been waiting up all day and all night for this call,"" he said. The three winners will share the 8 million Swedish kronor ($1.2 million) attached to the prize. Last year's physics prize went jointly to Francois Englert of Belgium and Peter Higgs of the United Kingdom for the theory of how particles acquire mass. Their theoretical brilliance was borne out when researchers confirmed the existence in 2012 of the Higgs boson, or ""God particle.""

"If you ever find yourself in Hunan, China, rent a car and drive the Jishou-Chadong Expressway: 18 tunnels under the Wuling mountains that culminate at the Aizhai Bridge, a gut-churning 1,150-foot-high suspension bridge over the Dehang Canyon.

For the thrill of seeing No. 1, you'd need to head to Kobe, Japan, and marvel at the Akashi-Kaikyo Bridge. But in the race to build the biggest and baddest bridges of them all, record-hungry China tends to dominate in hard stats; five out of the top 10 suspension bridges are there, for instance. So instead of a China-heavy list of bridges, we've focused on a variety of categories, from covered bridges to pontoon floaters, to bring you a diverse cross section of the longest. From the ice roads of Arctic Alaska to a cable-stayed controversy on the other side of the Bering Strait -- stretching over cities, seas and even the jungle canopy -- the world's longest bridges exist on a scale that can only be described as stupefying. Be sure to gas up before you take them on. Travel + Leisure: See more of the world's longest bridges . Longest suspension bridge span: Akashi-Kaikyo Bridge, Kobe, Japan . Length: 6,532 ft. Before this steel behemoth bridged the Akashi Strait that separates Kobe from Iwaya, severe storms in the area would routinely sink ferries. Not that the world's longest suspension bridge has it any easier: every day, 23,000 cars pass over a structure that must withstand earthquakes (a 7.2 magnitude earthquake hit in 1995), consistently strong tidal currents (9 knots), and wind gusts up to 179 mph. Completed in 1998, the record-setting central span 213 feet above the sea makes up over half its total 12,831-foot length; by comparison, the Golden Gate's central span is only 4,200 feet. For an up-close-and-personal (and gut-dropping) view, bridge tours take visitors to the top of one of the towers. jb-honshi.co.jp . World's top 25 destinations . Longest inhabited bridge: Krämerbrücke, Erfurt, Germany . Length: 259 ft. Like the Old London Bridge before it and Italy's Ponte Vecchio, the fairy tale-like Krämerbrücke, or Merchant's Bridge, is a bit of European history preserved in the modern day. After a series of fires destroyed previous attempts to build a span over the Breitstrom River in the 12th and 13th centuries, a stone arch bridge was built in 1325. Eventually, 62 half-timbered houses were added on top, 32 of which survived till today and continue to be home to shopkeepers and artisans. This multipurpose bridge has likely inspired more contemporary versions, like Zaha Hadid's 919-foot-long Bridge Pavilion in Zaragoza, Spain. erfurt-tourismus.de . The world's scariest bridges . Longest bridge over water (continuous): Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, Louisiana . Length: 23.87 miles . Due to recent feats of Chinese engineering, the four-lane, 5,189-pile concrete trestle bridge north of New Orleans got demoted by Guinness World Records for world's longest bridge over water. But the change did not come without controversy, with many Pontchartrain loyalists arguing that the new winner, a 25.84-mile elevated highway-bridge-tunnel project near Qingdao, China, actually has only 16.1 miles that span the sea compared to 23.79 miles of Pontchartrain's that are over open water. Guinness compromised by bestowing a new title upon the 58-year-old causeway: Longest Bridge Over Water (Continuous). However you rank it, it's still a pulse-quickening half-hour drive. thecauseway.us . Travel photos we wish we'd taken . Longest canopy walkway: Taman Negara Canopy Walkway, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia . Length: 1,509 ft. Deep in the heart of the Malaysian jungle, the Taman Negara Canopy Walkway provides visitors with unparalleled views and no shortage of thrills. For a mere $1.50, adventurers can channel their inner macaque (and probably see one, too) while traversing more than a quarter mile of narrow bridges strewn between centuries-old trees, offering up-close-and-vertigo-inducing views of local flora and fauna -- 160 feet above the jungle floor. taman-negara.com . Longest floating bridge: Evergreen Point Bridge, Seattle . Length: 7,580 ft. Officially known as Governor Albert D. Rosellini Bridge (the Washington statesman who oversaw its creation in the early 1960s), this section of State Route 520 connects Seattle to its eastern suburbs via a roadway that floats atop Lake Washington on 33 football field-size pontoons. The design was chosen due to the lake's unstable bed and the curved nature of the roadway (a common problem for the area, which would explain why the state is home to four of the five largest floating bridges in the world). The aging structure is currently being replaced by a larger, even longer, more modern floating bridge that can even accommodate a light-rail system. wsdot.wa.gov . Longest masonry arch bridge span: Pont de la Libération, Villeneuve-sur-Lot, France . Length: 315 ft. Though arch bridges are still popular today, they're usually built with modern materials like steel (see: Chongqing, China's Chaotianmen Bridge, at 5,712 feet the longest arch bridge span, period). Which is a shame, considering some masonry arch bridges (brick and/or stone) are so mathematically precise, not to mention beautiful, they could stand without mortar. More than 100 years old and spanning the Lot River in southwestern France, the Pont de la Libération is made of brick and unreinforced concrete -- technically very small stones and mortar. If it's anything like its distant cousin the Pont du Gard aqueduct, it will stand for hundreds more. Take note, China bridge barons. The world's strangest bridges . Longest covered bridge: The Hartland Bridge, New Brunswick, Canada . Length: 1,283 ft. The bridges of Madison County have nothing on this 112-year-old National Historic Site of Canada, which became the world's longest covered bridge only after two spans were destroyed by river ice in 1920, prompting replacement and a roof (covering helps prevent rot on the central wooden trusses). Built as a private bridge by a coalition of residents desperately in need of a direct way across the Saint John River -- 3 cents for a pedestrian; 6 cents for a horse and wagon -- it's now a regional icon open to all, beloved enough to get its own Google Doodle. town.hartland.nb.ca . Longest rail bridge: Danyang-Kunshan Grand Bridge, China . Length: 102.4 miles . Connecting Shanghai to Nanjing along the Beijing-Shanghai High-Speed Railway, this elevated viaduct was named the world's longest bridge -- period -- by Guinness World Records when it opened in 2011. (Also on the railway, the 70.6-mile Tianjin Grand Bridge, which connects Langfang to Qingxian, is the world's second longest.) Running parallel to the Yangtze River past lowland rice paddies, most of the span acts as an elevated railway, similar to the El in Chicago, though a 5.6-mile section does act like a traditional bridge, crossing the Yangcheng Lake in Suzhou. Longest ice bridge: Beaufort Sea Road, Alaska . Length: 68 miles . Time, fortitude and frigid cold are the only tools needed to build an ice bridge. Made popular by the hit reality TV series Ice Road Truckers, many of these cold-temperature roadways traverse a snowy mix of land and frozen lakes. But this span over the Beaufort Sea to Alaska's northernmost oil fields is pure Arctic ice. One of the most dangerous (and unique) bridges on this list, it is also one of the only ways to service the ExxonMobil hub of Point Thomson. The world's most dangerous bridges . Longest natural bridge span: The Fairy Bridge, Guangxi, China . Length: 400 ft. Though bridges are one of the greatest examples of human engineering, they are hardly a creation unique to man: rock archways hewn by Mother Nature (usually by erosion) likely provided inspiration for our brick-and-steel masterworks. And wouldn't you know it, even in this category of bridges, China still dominates. The country is home to three of the longest natural bridge spans in the world, including the 400-foot stunner over the Buliu River near the border of Vietnam. Carved out of a limestone karst, the Fairy Bridge (Xianren Qiao) is an isolated structure accessible only by a three-hour rafting trip. naturalarches.org .

"After years of causing angst for White House political aides by delving into issues of race, Attorney General Eric Holder is heading to Ferguson, Missouri, as President Barack Obama's top emissary. The trip on Wednesday to the St. Louis suburb now in the spotlight represents the latest effort by the Obama administration to find a way to calm racial tensions following the police shooting of Michael Brown, 18. Under Holder, the first black attorney general, the Justice Department has intensified its scrutiny of police departments, launching 20 investigations of police practices and alleged discriminatory enforcement patterns in the past five years. That's more than twice the number of such probes in the previous five years. That record is part of Holder's pitch to reassure the local community in Ferguson that the Justice Department will properly investigate the shooting of Brown, who was unarmed, by a white officer, Darren Wilson. Ferguson has been at the center of daily standoffs between protesters and police since the August 9 shooting. Some of the protests have turned violent. Holder's visit will focus on the Justice Department's civil rights investigation, which is examining whether Wilson acted properly in using deadly force. The federal probe is separate from a criminal one being conducted by local authorities. ""At a time when so much may seem uncertain, the people of Ferguson can have confidence that the Justice Department intends to learn — in a fair and thorough manner — exactly what happened,"" Holder wrote in an opinion piece for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch ahead of his trip. ""We understand the need for an independent investigation, and we hope that the independence and thoroughness of our investigation will bring some measure of calm to the tensions in Ferguson,"" he added. Holder has been outspoken on issues related to disparity in the judicial system and has led efforts to reduce disparities in sentences that statistically have greater effect on racial minorities. Obama cautious on Ferguson . While those efforts have the backing of Obama, Holder's public views on the issue of race haven't always been welcome for the White House. In his first major speech after taking office in 2009, Holder told a Black History Month gathering at the Justice Department: ""Though this nation has proudly thought of itself as an ethnic melting pot, in things racial we have always been and continue to be, in too many ways, essentially a nation of cowards."" Obama criticized the ""nation of cowards"" characterization, saying ""if I had been advising my attorney general, we would have used different language."" Privately, Holder believed he was right. But he stayed away from the issue for a while. At the same time, he vowed to reinvigorate the Justice Department's civil rights division, which was the center of controversy over partisan meddling during the administration of President George W. Bush. Concerns about prosecutor . That unit enforces a 1994 law approved after the Rodney King beating by police in Los Angeles that makes it unlawful for police to engage in a pattern or practice that deprives people of their constitutional rights. Of the 20 investigations the civil rights division has launched in the past five years, seven are ongoing, including those against police departments in Albuquerque, Miami, and Cleveland. As a result of increased scrutiny, there are now 13 law enforcement agencies subject to agreements with the Justice Department. Seven of those are under court-ordered consent decrees, the largest number in the department's history. Holder has criticized some of the police response to the street protests in Ferguson, while at the same time advocating enforcement against people rioting and looting. He has sent Justice Department officials to provide technical assistance to police, suggesting less aggressive tactics and avoiding the use of military-style vehicles to deal with protesters. 5 things to know about the shooting . Among those sent to Ferguson is Ronald Davis, who heads the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services. A former police chief in East Palo Alto, California, Davis is African-American and has spoken out about racial profiling by police. ""I am a black man who is subject to increased scrutiny from my community, my profession, and my country because of the color of my skin,"" Davis said at a 2012 hearing. He added that he is proud to be a police officer, but noted that ""as a black man with a 14-year-old son, Glenn, I know that when I teach him how to drive a car I must also teach him what to do when stopped by the police -- a mandatory course for young men of color. ""I must also prepare him for the bias he is likely to face and the reality that, despite the strength of his character or his contributions to society, there will be those who will attach criminality to him simply because of the color of his skin,"" Davis said.

"The guest who was perhaps most anticipated at Sunday's star-studded Clinton Global Initiative awards ceremony was a no-show. Mom-to-be Chelsea Clinton squelched any idea that she might already have given birth when she took the stage at the kickoff to the annual meeting of the Clintons' philanthropic arm. In her remarks Clinton, who is expecting this fall with husband Marc Mezvinsky, thanked the audience for their warm wishes on her ""impending, though hopefully not immediate, arrival,"" and proclaimed herself ""very excited about making my mother a grandmother soon."" Chelsea Clinton baby watch: What we know . Her parents are clearly more than ready. Despite a heavy schedule of speaking engagements, fundraising for the midterm elections and the high-profile Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting, the soon-to-be-grandparents are poised for the baby's arrival. Earlier this month, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned an audience in Iowa she might dash offstage at any moment if her daughter went into labor. And in a Sunday interview with CNN, former President Bill Clinton suggested the baby would probably arrive in the next 10 days. ""We're on watch now,"" he said Sunday on ""Fareed Zakaria GPS."" ""I hope by the first of October, I'll be a grandfather."" Chelsea Clinton, the vice chairwoman of the Clinton Foundation, is scheduled to moderate a discussion with business leaders at the annual meeting Tuesday. Having a mother and two grandparents interested in public policy may rub off on the new arrival. Hillary Clinton teased her husband during the awards ceremony Sunday, saying he might be an overly wonky grandfather. ""Now in case you haven't noticed, one of my husband's favorite words is interdependence,"" she said. ""I can just see him with our new grandchild saying I wanna read, talk and sing to you to help build your brain, which is one of our Clinton Foundation initiatives, but first I need to talk to you about interdependence."" Hillary Clinton's fall to-do list . When the baby does come, its gender will be a surprise, Bill Clinton told CNN. ""They want to be surprised,"" he said.

"Rep. Paul Ryan might have to decide which job he wants more -- running the powerful House Ways and Means Committee or running for president in 2016. House Republicans adopted a new rule that could force Ryan's hand as he considers his future. The new provision requires any House committee chair who decides to seek higher office to turn in his or her gavel. The Wisconsin Republican is viewed one of his party's top policymakers. Ryan currently serves as the Budget Committee chair, but is seeking support for the post as the head of the tax writing panel in 2015, and is expected to get the nod next week. Ryan has made no secret that he views that post, which would make him the lead to craft health care changes, tax reform and other major legislation, as his dream job.  The former 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee has also left the door open to a bid for the 2016 presidential ticket. Although the rule wasn't directly aimed at Ryan, his name mentioned when the proposal came up for a vote inside a closed door meeting on Friday. According to one GOP source familiar with the discussion, he was present for the discussion, but there wasn't any extensive debate about the change. Ryan's office declined to comment on the new rule. Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole drafted the proposal in response to a situation that developed last year when Georgia Rep. Jack Kingston, who chaired a key Appropriations subcommittee, ran for Senate, according to two House Republican sources. Kingston presided over the panel that drafts the annual budgets for Labor and Health agencies, but failed to pass a bill through his committee because he was focused on his campaign. Kingston didn't win the GOP Senate nomination, and Cole and other members on the Appropriations committee, felt that the lack of action hurt the overall effort to put together the full series of funding bills for the year. The new rule does come with an out -- Ryan could seek a waiver from leaders if he decides to run for president but wants to retain his chairmanship. Given his close ties to House Speaker John Boehner and others, it's likely he could get one.","Rep. Paul Ryan is pursuing the chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee .
A new rule would prevent holding that job and running for president .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Several gunmen remain inside a besieged mall in Nairobi, Kenya, two senior officials said, as a deadly standoff between Kenyan forces and terrorists stretches into a fourth day. Kenya's Interior Ministry tweeted late Monday that authorities were in control of the Westgate Shopping Mall -- the latest in a series of social media posts from officials reassuring a nervous public that there was little chance of escape for any surviving Al-Shabaab gunmen who had terrorized the mall, killing at least 62 people. ""Taken control of all the floors. We're not here to feed the attackers with pastries but to finish and punish them,"" Kenyan police Inspector General David Kimaiyo said on Twitter. But even as police stressed on Twitter that they were in charge of the situation, two senior Kenyan officials told CNN that gunmen -- including snipers -- were still inside the four-story mall. It wasn't clear whether any hostages remained. The Kenya Red Cross said 65 people were missing after the attack. Gunfire echoed from the mall sporadically during the day, sending journalists and aid workers scrambling for cover. Thick heavy smoke -- from a fire set by terrorists, according to Kenyan authorities -- billowed into the air much of the afternoon. Kenya assault raises new fears about Somali recruitment . Three terrorists have been confirmed killed since Saturday, the Interior Ministry said Monday. Eleven Kenyan soldiers have been wounded, according to the Kenya Defence Forces. More than 200 civilians have been rescued, the military said. Away from the mall, Kenyan authorities said they had arrested more than 10 people for questioning in connection with the attack, including at least four taken into custody at an airport. Authorities urged law enforcement officers to closely scrutinize travelers' documents, and the country's Immigration Department said in a tweet that it had increased security at entry and exit points. Surviving the Nairobi mall massacre: 'Just lucky' Americans involved? Kenyan Foreign Minister Amina Mohamed told ""PBS NewsHour"" that some of the attackers had come from the United States. She said they were originally from Minnesota and Missouri, PBS reported Monday. ""As you know, both the victims and the perpetrators came from Kenya, the United Kingdom and the United States,"" she said. ""From the information that we have, two or three Americans, and I think so far I've heard of one Brit"" as being among the attackers. ""The Americans, from the information we have, are young men, about between maybe 18 and 19, of Somalia origin or Arab origin,"" Mohamed told PBS. She offered no other specifics. Her comments seemed to expound on those of Gen. Julius Karangi, chief of Defense Forces. ""We have an idea who these people are and they are clearly a multinational collection from all over the world,"" he told reporters in Nairobi. ""This is not clearly a local event. We are fighting global terrorism here."" Before its Twitter account was suspended, Al-Shabaab issued a list of the names of nine people it said were among the attackers. It said three were from the United States, two from Somalia and one each from Canada, Finland, Kenya and the United Kingdom. Sources within Al-Shabaab also told CNN that the nine names published on Twitter were among the alleged hostage-takers, but CNN has not been able to independently confirm that. U.S. officials don't have any confirmation of Americans having been involved in the attack, according to Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes and another senior official. Intelligence analysts are poring over electronic intercepts in an effort to verify the terror group's claims, two law enforcement sources told CNN. The FBI also was looking into the claims, law enforcement officials told CNN. ""At this point we have no definitive evidence of the nationalities or identities of the perpetrators,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Monday. In the past, federal officials and Somali-American leaders in Minneapolis have reported that Al-Shabaab has recruited young men there to go to Africa to fight. U.S. President Barack Obama expressed condolences over the attack after a meeting on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly Monday. He didn't specify whether Americans had been involved, but he pledged U.S. support and described the situation as a matter of global concern. ""This, I think, underscores the degree to which all of us as an international community have to stand against the kind of senseless violence that these kinds of groups represent,"" Obama said. The siege . The terrorist attack began at midday Saturday, Nairobi time, with an estimated 10 to 15 gunmen taking over the mall in what hospital volunteer Abiti Shah said witnesses told her was ""like a Hollywood action scene."" ""They just started firing in the air,"" Shah said, retelling the witness accounts. A youth cooking competition was taking place at the mall at the time, and terrified shoppers fled for their lives as gunfire echoed through the building. Witnesses said the gunmen went from store to store, shooting people, and then took hostages. Survivor Bendita Malakia, a North Carolina woman who moved to Nairobi in July, told CNN affiliate WAVY that she took refuge behind the closed metal gates of a store with dozens of others. The Kenyan spirit cannot be broken, says eyewitness resident . ""While we were back there, you could hear them methodically going from store to store, talking to people and asking questions,"" she said. ""They were shooting, screaming. Then it would stop for a while and they would go to another store."" Al-Shabaab has claimed that the attackers targeted non-Muslims and vowed they would not negotiate for the hostages' lives. CNN security analyst Peter Bergen said the terrorists apparently took hostages only to prolong the siege and win more media attention. The dead . Most of the dead were said to be Kenyans. Six British citizens, two French nationals, two Indians and two Canadians, including a diplomat, also died, their governments said. Those killed include: . • Elif Yavuz, a senior vaccines researcher for the Clinton Health Access Initiative based in Tanzania. Yavuz, a Dutch national, was pregnant and expecting her first child in October, according to Julio Frenk, dean of faculty at the Harvard School of Public Health. ""Elif was brilliant, dedicated, and deeply admired by her colleagues, who will miss her terribly,"" the Clinton family said in a statement. The Dutch Foreign Affairs Ministry confirmed a 33-year-old Dutch woman had been killed. • A major African poet, author and Ghanian statesman, Kofi Awoonor, Ghana's president said. Awoonor received his Ph.D. from New York's Stony Brook University and was a professor of literature there in the 1970s. • The nephew of Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and the man's fiancee. • A Peruvian doctor, Juan Jesus Ortiz, who had previously worked for the United Nations Fund for Children and lived in Kenya doing consulting work, the country's Foreign Affairs Ministry said. • Sridhar Natarajan, 40, an Indian national and employee of a local pharmaceutical firm, and 8-year-old Paramshu Jain, the son of a bank branch manager, CNN sister network CNN-IBN reported, citing government officials in New Delhi. The wounded . Kenyatta said more than 175 people had been wounded. Five were Americans, the State Department said Sunday. Elaine Dang, 26, a University of California, Berkeley, graduate from San Diego, underwent surgery to her chest, arms and legs. ""I'm OK, I'm very grateful to be alive,"" she told CNN affiliate KFMB-TV . She said two friends died in the attack. Al-Shabaab breaks new ground with complex Nairobi attack . The terrorists . The Somalia-based Al-Shabaab terror group had said on Twitter that it had sent the gunmen to the mall in retaliation for Kenya's involvement in an African Union military effort against the group, which is al Qaeda's proxy in Somalia. Last year, the Kenyan military was part of a peacekeeping force that defeated Al-Shabaab forces to liberate the key Somali port of Kismayo. Since Kenya launched attacks against Al-Shabaab in Somalia in 2011, the group has hurled grenades at Kenyan churches, bus stops and other public places. The mall attack is the deadliest terror attack in Kenya since al Qaeda blew up the U.S. Embassy there in 1998, killing 213 people. On Monday, Kenya's foreign minister told CNN it's clear that Al-Shabaab was not acting alone. ""This bares the hallmarks of al Qaeda. This is not just Al-Shabaab. In fact, the leaders are not Somali, as you may have heard. This was al Qaeda. It was a very well-coordinated effort, it was very well planned,"" Mohamed said. But the attackers' national origins are irrelevant, she said. ""It doesn't matter where they come from. There are some Americans. There are some Brits. There are some others. It has nothing to do with the nationality of people,"" Mohamed said. ""They are all evil and we must deal with them as such."" Al-Shabaab grew amid Somalia's lawlessness . The investigation . Lenku said that Monday's effort to roust the terrorists was a Kenyan operation, but government sources told CNN that Israeli special forces also were at the scene. Kenyatta, the Kenyan president, vowed Sunday to punish those responsible for the attacks. ""They shall not get away with their despicable, beastly acts. Like the cowardly perpetrators now cornered in the building, we will punish the masterminds swiftly and indeed very painfully,"" he said. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry promised an American investigation. Kenya bloodshed: World leaders react . ""Obviously, it's an enormous offense against everybody's sense of right and wrong,"" Kerry said. ""It represents the seriousness and the breadth of the challenge we face with ruthless and completely reckless terrorists, and we're going to pursue them."" Michael Pearson reported and wrote from Atlanta; Zain Verjee and Nima Elbagir reported from Nairobi. CNN's Arwa Damon, Becky Anderson, Lillian Lesposo, Holly Yan, Greg Botelho, Brian Walker, Jackie Castillo, David Simpson, Dominique Dodley and Kevin Conlon also contributed to this report.","NEW: Kenyan minister: ""From the information that we have,"" 2-3 of the attackers are American .

"The Pentagon's most expensive weapons program ever, the F-35 warplane, is cleared for takeoff again. The limited flight clearance, approved by Navy and Air Force officials Monday, allows the aircraft to fly with an engine inspection regimen and restricted flight envelope following the fleet's grounding after an engine fire last month. Defense Department spokesman Mark Wright said in a statement Tuesday the restrictions would ""remain in effect until the root cause of the June 23 engine mishap is identified and corrected."" It had been hoped that the stealth fighter would be able to make an appearance at the famed Farnborough air show, under way now, but Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said Tuesday afternoon that won't happen. ""The Department of Defense, in concert with our partners in the U.K., has decided not to send Marine Corps and U.K. F-35B aircraft across the Atlantic to participate in the Farnborough air show,"" he told reporters.  ""This decision was reached after a consultation with senior leaders and airworthiness authorities, despite the decision by airworthiness authorities to clear the aircraft to return to flight -- to limited flight."" The 2014 Farnborough International Airshow began Monday, and runs through July 20 in Farnborough, England.  The opening day brought $42 billion of orders and commitments for commercial aircraft and engines, according to a statement from the show's organizers. The F-35 was developed at a cost of nearly $400 billion so far and beset for years by cost overruns and delays. The so-called Joint Strike Fighter was temporarily grounded following a fire on the runway at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. No one was hurt. Engine maker Pratt & Whitney worked with Air Force investigators to inspect all engines in the fleet. ""We have great confidence in the F135 engine powering the F-35, and we have worked very closely with DoD and the Services to return the aircraft to flying status,"" Matthew Bates, communications manager for Pratt & Whitney Military Engines, said in a statement Tuesday. The F-35's lead contractor, Lockheed Martin, which is producing variants of the plane for the U.S. Navy, Marines and Air Force,  also worked with investigators following the fleet's grounding. F-35 future . The Pentagon wants more than 2,400 of the fighter jets ultimately, while hundreds more are expected over time to go to allies such as South Korea, Japan and Australia. More than 100 planes have been built so far, most for testing, but the program is still in its development and training phases. The military says the stealthy fighter will be ""the most affordable, lethal, supportable and survivable aircraft ever to be used"" by so many services worldwide. But its production has been controversial for its soaring cost history -- the price tag has nearly doubled from early estimates, to $135 million per unit as of last year, according to a U.S. Government Accountability Office report in March -- as well as its schedule, software and other setbacks. Test flights began in 2007. While all models have been grounded in the past for various problems, the version for the Marines, the F-35B, has had more issues. Experts say that's mainly due to its design for shorter takeoffs and vertical landings. Richard Aboulafia, a Teal Group analyst, said earlier this month that every component of the F-35 overall ""is pushing the frontiers of technology"" as engineers combine extraordinary engine power with a lighter weight design. He said the program has made gradual progress in recent years where glitches get resolved pretty quickly compared with 18 to 24 months ago, when setbacks seemed to come one right after another. ""It's a tremendously complex project,"" he said, adding that cost issues remain a concern.","The F-35 won't participate in the Farnborough air show, Pentagon spokesman says .

"U.S. authorities are looking for possible links between a grenade found at the scene of a drug cartel shootout in Mexico earlier this month that killed three police officers and an American who allegedly made similar improvised grenades from parts exported from the United States. A source close to the investigation says the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives wants to examine the device recovered to see if it bears signatures of a grenade-manufacturing operation authorities allege was run by Jean Baptiste Kingery. The device was found at an October 10 shootout in Jalisco state, between local cartel members and Mexican police, according to an internal ATF report reviewed by CNN. Kingery was arrested in 2011 and is facing charges in Mexico for allegedly importing grenade hulls and other parts, and making them into improvised explosives sold to drug cartels. ATF agents began investigating him in 2010 and federal prosecutors continue to pursue the case. An attorney in Mexico couldn't be located. Mexican authorities have been finding grenade hulls allegedly tied to Kingery for years, sources close to the investigation say. Following complaints from cartel members that grenades detonated too quickly, he allegedly changed their fusing system over the years, U.S. bomb technicians found. He also told investigators that he taught cartel members his techniques to manufacture grenades, according to two sources close to the case. 'Fast and Furious' entanglement . The Kingery case briefly became entangled in the ATF scandal over the botched ""Fast and Furious"" gun sting, in which ATF agents from the Phoenix allowed suspected arms smugglers to buy about 2,000 firearms, many of which have turned up in crime scenes in Mexico and the United States. ATF agents hoped to use the sales to prosecute major smugglers, but had no way to track the weapons. The discovery of the grenade in Jalisco earlier this month and the ATF report that called it possibly a ""Kingery"" grenade, has led to reports that the case may be a new ""Fast and Furious""-like scandal for the agency. But the cases differ in several respects. In early 2010, ATF agents working with Mexican counterparts attempted a sting operation to nab Kingery as he allegedly transported grenade parts across the border from the United States to Mexico. Mexican authorities lost track of Kingery and failed to stop the shipment, according to people close to the case. Unlike ""Fast and Furious"" where ATF agents didn't alert Mexican authorities to the gun sales they were allowing, the agency worked with Mexican agents throughout in the Kingery case. The matter is under investigation by the Justice Department inspector general, who is expected to issue a report soon. Members of Congress are also tracking the case. The ATF agent who led the Kingery investigation, Pete Forcelli, says ATF's efforts were complicated by U.S. laws that treat the grenade hulls as novelty items, easily available at military surplus stores and online. It is illegal to export them without license, but there are few restrictions otherwise. Forcelli, who was a whistleblower in the ""Fast and Furious"" case, says agents working the Kingery case were frustrated that prosecutors wouldn't bring charges against him. ""I want to ensure the public that at no time while under ATF surveillance did Jean Baptiste Kingery possess or transport live hand grenades,"" Forcelli said in a statement. ""Since the items Kingery possessed are not contraband, we were powerless to seize them inside of the United States."" Mexican authorities arrested Kingery in August 2011 in a subsequent Mexican operation with ATF. Authorities also found his alleged grenade factory where they found parts that could have been used to manufacture about a 1,000 grenades, sources close to the case say. ATF, prosecutors clash . Both the ""Fast and Furious"" and the Kingery cases were troubled in part because of bitter fighting between ATF and prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Phoenix. Agents said a lead prosecutor in both cases, Emory Hurley, obstructed attempts to bring charges. Hurley remains in the Phoenix office, but was reassigned to the civil section after an inspector general's probe blamed him for some of the ""Fast and Furious"" problems. Hurley didn't return a call seeking comment and a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office declined comment on his behalf. In the Kingery case, Forcelli and other ATF agents arrested him in June 2010 in Arizona and seized 116 grenade hulls and other parts. He told investigators that he operated a mill in Mexico to make grenades and sold them to cartels, according to internal ATF documents first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Hurley declined to bring charges and ATF agents were required to free him, according to sources close to the case. Despite Kingery's statements to the ATF,  Hurley said there wasn't enough evidence and that Kingery could easily claim the grenade hulls were novelty items. Such grenade hulls are commonly sold as desktop trinkets labeled ""complaint department, take a number."" Prosecutors in Phoenix told Justice Department officials who investigated the matter a different version of events, according to sources familiar with their account. They said they wanted investigators to watch Kingery more and charge him later. They also said ATF agents wanted to make Kingery an informant. ATF agents disputed that account and told Congressional investigators from the offices of Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and California Rep. Darrell Issa, Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, who investigated ""Fast and Furious."" Agents investigating Kingery provided whistleblower testimony to Congress about ""Fast and Furious."" Still some mystery . A source close to the Kingery case says if the latest grenade found in Jalisco is deemed similar to those made by Kingery, it still leaves some mystery of their source. That's because cartel members apparently taught by Kingery may have manufactured it after his arrest. ""He was running a grenade-making school and workshop,"" one source close to the case says. Mexican authorities and ATF technicians noticed a new fusing system in grenades allegedly tied to Kingery after they began turning up in late 2010 and early 2011, two sources close to the case say. The new fuses provided a three-to-four second delay so cartel members could throw the devices and have time to get away unharmed. The devices have been deadly to the Mexican military and police fighting the cartels, and to rival gangs. Ginger Colbrun, an ATF spokeswoman, said in a statement that ""we have not determined the origin of the devices"" used in the Jalisco state shooting. ""The description that was used in a document leaked to the press was a term used by law enforcement who recovered and reported the devices. There is no evidence at this time or any indication the device originated from the Jean Baptiste Kingery investigation. Authorities will have to process the devices at the laboratory to determine if there is any forensic connection,"" Colbrun said.","ATF is looking at ties between American and hand grenades used in shootout in Mexico .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Freshman U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson refused to back down Wednesday from remarks made on the House floor the night before, in which he said the Republican health care plan calls for sick people to ""die quickly."" Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Florida, made the ""die quickly"" remark on the House floor Tuesday night. In fact, Grayson, a Democrat who represents a central Florida swing district that includes Orlando, made another floor speech in which he apologized to the dead and their families for not acting sooner on health care reform. He then defended both speeches on CNN's ""The Situation Room."" ""What I mean is they have got no plan,"" Grayson told Wolf Blitzer. ""It's been 24 hours since I said that. Where is the Republican plan? We're all waiting to see something that will take care of the pre-existing conditions, to take care of the 40 million Americans who have no coverage at all. ""That's what I meant when I said that the Republican plan is don't get sick. And if you do get sick, die quickly.""  Watch Grayson defend comments » . Republicans pounced on Grayson's late-night speech and demanded an apology.  Watch Grayson's ""die quickly"" remark on House floor » . ""That is about the most mean-spirited partisan statement that I've ever heard made on this floor, and I, for one, don't appreciate it,""  Rep. Jimmy Duncan, R-Tennessee, told Politico. On Wednesday, Grayson apologized, but it wasn't the apology the Republicans wanted. Citing a Harvard University study released this month that said 44,000 Americans die each year because they have no health insurance, Grayson called on Democrats and Republicans ""to do our jobs for the sake of those dying people and their families."" ""I apologize to the dead and their families that we haven't voted sooner to end this holocaust in America,"" he said. That prompted National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Ken Spain to issue a stinging rebuke, saying Grayson is ""doubling down on his despicable remarks, and he is dragging his party with him."" ""This is an individual who has established a pathological pattern of unstable behavior,"" Spain said. ""He is derailing the national debate on health care reform and embarrassing his constituents as a result."" But in a spirited discussion on CNN that included Democratic strategist James Carville and Republican strategist Alex Castellanos, Grayson stood his ground. He rejected the suggestion that his remarks were the political equivalent of South Carolina Republican Rep. Joe Wilson's shout of, ""You lie,"" at the president during his nationally televised speech on health care. ""I didn't insult the president in front of 40 million people,"" he said. "" ... When you don't have a plan, what that means is your plan is don't get sick. So what I said is true. What Joe Wilson said, on the other hand, is false."" Castellanos insisted that Republicans agreed with the Democrats on pre-existing conditions and would ""stand with him 100 percent"" if the president added such Republican-backed proposals as tort reform and allowing citizens to shop across state lines for insurance -- a strategy Democrats say will drive insurance companies into the states with the most lax regulations. ""The congressman is at least giving the chance for the Republicans to look responsible. It's not fair to say that the Republicans have no plan. They actually do,"" said Castellanos, whose campaigns include those of George W. Bush in 2004, Mitt Romney in 2008, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and the late Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina in the 1990s. Carville, who was Bill Clinton's lead strategist during his successful run for the presidency in 1992 and worked on Hillary Clinton's campaign last year, congratulated Grayson for having ""the courage to go up and say what he said."" But Carville backed away from Grayson when the congressman said that Republicans he believes are obstructing health care reform are ""foot-dragging, knuckle-dragging Neanderthals."" ""I would call [them] regressive as opposed to Neanderthal,"" Carville said. Grayson also rejected comparisons between his comments and those of some Republicans, including former Alaska governor and GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, that the Democratic reform plan called for ""death panels"" to decide who would get life-saving treatments. ""I said to myself, 'I wish Sarah Palin read the bill.' That's not what this bill says. That's a scare tactic,"" he said. ""What I said is the God's honest truth."" Grayson said he decided to deliver his after-hours speech Tuesday after the Harvard study was released and he realized ""we cannot go on any longer in this country where people cannot afford health care, where the coverage they got is good until they need it."" Calling for universal health care, he slammed ""whoever it is that's causing the Republicans to fight tooth-and-nail against anything, absolutely anything, to have every vote come down to being 257 to 175 in the House, over and over and over again."" ""Those are the people who are really disserving Americans,"" he said. CNN's Alexander Mooney contributed to this report.","Rep. Alan Grayson: GOP health care plan calls for sick to ""die quickly""

"The Obama administration went into the first hours of the new enrollment period under the Affordable Care Act with confidence that last year's problems with HealthCare.gov were behind them. ""We've spent the last year improving and upgrading HealthCare.gov, to make it faster and easier to use,"" President Barack Obama said in his weekly address as the enrollment period launched Saturday morning. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said that more than 23,000 people submitted an application in the first eight hours of enrollment and more than 1.2 million unique visitors shopped for coverage on HealthCare.gov last week. There were reports, including from USA Today, of some glitches in the enrollment process. When asked by CNN whether applicants were having any problems with the website, officials declined to comment. Depending on where they live, consumers are finding premiums that have increased or decreased, according to new data released by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The change in premiums differs widely state to state, according to multiple independent consulting firms that analyzed the data. In Alaska, the average lowest bronze plan premium increased 28% and in Mississippi, the same plan's premium decreased 19%. On average, states saw a 3-4% increase in premiums, according to Avalere Health, a research and consulting firm. ""The bottom line is that exchange enrollee's 2015 premiums will vary widely based on geography,"" Elizabeth Carpenter, director at Avalere Health, said in a press release. A separate study by PriceWaterhouseCoopers -- which analyzed 43 states and the District of Columbia --  found that premiums are rising 5.6% on average. The administration has not released an official number on the change in premiums. As a new enrollment period for Obamacare begins, Republicans are not shying away in their fight to put an end to Obamacare. ""Conservatives should... take advantage of opportunities to repeal any part of the law and replace it with better policies that empower Americans, not Washington,"" Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch wrote in USA Today this week. Wyoming Republican Sen. John Barrasso, an orthopedic surgeon and health policy expert, said that GOP hopes of repealing Obamacare are not realistic until there is a Republican in the White House. But he told WPBI radio last month conservatives should ""systematically strip away the worst parts of Obamacare."" But some conservatives want a more radical approach, and recommend repealing Obamacare by using the budget tool reconciliation, which requires only 51 votes and, ironically, was used to pass the law in 2010. Administration officials are continuing to encourage signups, claiming there will be more affordable choices for 2015. ""This window won't stay open forever.  You only have three months to shop for plans, so it's worth starting right away.  And it might make a big difference for your family's bottom line,"" Obama said in his weekly address. At the start of last year's rollout, HealthCare.gov was plagued with technical issues, preventing consumers from purchasing insurance, which the Obama administration ascribed to ""glitches"" due to high traffic on the site. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, there is a 25% increase in issuers in the marketplace and more than 90% of consumers will be able to select from three or more issuers. ""Today's data provides further evidence that the Affordable Care Act is working to improve competition and choice among Marketplace plans in 2015,"" CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner said. ""Consumers should shop around, with new options available this year they're likely to find a better deal."" More than 7 million people enrolled in insurance through the Affordable Care Act and paid an average of $82 a month, according to the Obama administration. A Gallup poll released Friday found that over seven in 10 Americans who bought health insurance policies through the government exchange rate the quality of their healthcare as ""excellent"" or ""good.""

"You've heard of crowdfunding -- raising funds through donations on the internet -- well, get ready for ""like"" funding. An enterprising new startup in Hong Kong has devised a way of harnessing Facebook ""likes"" as a way of getting valuable donations to worthy causes and, at the same time, boosting the corporate social responsibility profile of the companies that provide the cash. Called Likefunding.me, the small team in Hong Kong's Science Park district -- the city's answer to Silicon Valley -- works to bring good stories and brands together. Co-founder Kelly Yim -- a former actuary with a major bank -- left her job to devise a system that would benefit charities, creative projects and social enterprise projects. ""We want to rally supporters to share interesting stories on creative projects that carry a sponsor's logo. Through this sharing we can generate a measurable media exposure for corporate sponsors,"" Yim said, adding that sponsors get their corporate logo embedded with the story which appears whenever the project is 'liked' or shared. ""We know creative projects have the capacity to go viral -- just look at the potato salad project. We want to devise a system that allows people with these kind of projects to monetize their media exposure,"" she added. With corporations donating a purse of a maximum of between $1,500 and $2,000, internet users can choose from a menu of projects to ""like."" Each ""like"" will typically give the project around $HK2 and each ""like"" will carry the backer's brand logo. ""What we do is match-make creative projects with corporates,"" explained Yim. ""We have a database of different projects currently from Hong Kong and then we have contact with the corporate sponsors. ""After we match-make them based on their corporate social responsibility objectives, we provide a web link for the creative projects, which is for their supporters to share the story with a different Facebook circle."" Using a simple embeddable button on the project, all supporters have to do is click the button to make a mini-donation. The business model for Likefunding is similar to crowdfunding models where the company takes 10% of the successful funds raised. For a company that only filed its invention patent five months ago and had a beta-launch in August, it already has more than a few successes under its belt. One in particular was a Hong Kong school principal who quit his job to start a charity organization to provide free tutorials to underprivileged children. ""In a matter of just six hours, he generated 5,000 'likes' and 8,000 shares,"" Yim said. ""The result was quite impressive because the media exposure that project created was probably worth more than the exposure he got through Hong Kong's mainstream press."" Other projects include work with abandoned animals and medical projects in China. ""The ultimate objective is to make it like an advertising platform -- corporates can come to us, find the projects they want and at the same time their investment can be supporting interesting initiatives,"" she said. Good stories, she says, have the capacity to go viral and can be worth more to corporations than the equivalent in advertising. While there is a cap on the corporate donation so that a compelling and viral story does not sink its benefactor with Facebook ""likes,"" Yim said that a donation of around $2,000 can make a big difference to a small charity. As for Likefunding, the company is looking to break even after next year. Yim said that while many startups founder within a year, she has high hopes for the group she helped to set up. More than anything, she said, a startup needs money and it needs publicity when it starts out. She believes the Likefunding model has the capacity to deliver both. Meanwhile, its most difficult task at the moment is educating a skeptical industry. Digital media specialist Napoleon Biggs said the model was, as yet, largely untested. ""I'm really not sure if people are prepared to have sponsors ride their posts in exchange for funding a project. I guess if it's a cause that you believe in, why not,"" he said. For Yim, however, the whole thrust of Likefunding is getting corporates to put their money where their Facebook ""likes"" are. ""It takes a lot of perseverance to get corporations to invest in this type of creative project -- it'll at least take a year to educate them,"" Yim said, adding that the group have now set their sites on China as its next frontier and is already investigating a tie-up with the mainland digital giant Sina Weibo.

"(CNN) -- What do you do when your 10-year-old son wakes up in the middle of the night screaming, ""There's a 'roo in my room!"" Beat Ettlin wrestled a kangaroo out of his house near Canberra after it crashed through a window. If you're Beat Ettlin, you wrest the marsupial into a headlock, drag it down your hallway and toss it out your front door. Ettlin and his family were woken early Sunday when a 6-foot-tall kangaroo crashed through a window, landed on their bed and thrashed around their house in the suburb of Garran, south of the capital of Canberra, Australia. ""At first, he (my husband) thought it was a lunatic ninja,"" said Ettlin's wife, Verity Beman. ""It leaped through the window, this martial-arts kind of figure. It was very Jackie Chan."" The family's one-story house is in a suburb that butts against a kangaroo reserve. About 2 a.m. Sunday, their dog began barking furiously. Possibly possums, they thought. The family had put up with possums scampering across their roof every night since they moved in three weeks ago. Moments later, the window was smashed and a black figure landed on their bed. Ettlin, after gathering his wits about him, exclaimed, ""It's OK. It's only a kangaroo,"" Beman recalled. ""I was cowered under the quilt, thinking, 'No, it's not OK,'"" she said. The kangaroo jumped on top of the blanket that Beman and her 9-year-old daughter were hiding under. It then leaped onto the nightstand, punched holes in the furniture and left blood stains on the wall as it bounced into their son's room. ""That's when his male instinct kicked in,"" Beman said of her husband. After putting the 90-pound creature in a choke hold, Ettlin kept it low to the ground and pulled it toward the front door. He knew that kangaroos carry their strength on their hind legs, Beman said. ""He held it by one arm. He opened the front door with the other, then the screen door,"" she said. ""It bounced across our veranda and bounced away."" Ettlin is a chef, originally from the Swiss city of Stans. Beman thinks he would not have tackled the kangaroo so readily were he Australian. ""They would be fully aware of the risk,"" she said. The house in shambles -- with blood and shattered glass everywhere -- Ettlin stood surveying the damage in his shredded underpants. Scratch marks ran down his leg, but otherwise he was fine. ""I kept marveling at what he did,"" Beman said. ""I called him my hero. My hero in Bonds undies.""","Beat Ettlin wrestles with kangaroo that leapt through window into house .

"A surgeon diagnosed with Ebola in his native Sierra Leone has arrived in the United States, where he will undergo treatment at Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. Dr. Martin Salia, who is a legal permanent resident of the United States, is married to a U.S. citizen, his relatives told CNN Baltimore affiliate WJZ. Shortly after his arrival Saturday afternoon, doctors said his situation was dire. ""He is extremely ill. We have multiple highly-trained specialists who are experts in their fields targeting his most serious medical issues,"" said Dr. Phil Smith, medical director of the Biocontainment Unit at Nebraska Medical Center. The Sierra Leone team that was caring for him described him as critically ill, possibly sicker than the first patients successfully treated in the United States. ""My sister is very worried and upset,"" his wife's brother, Ibrahim Kargbo, told CNN, referring to Salia's wife, Isatu. ""Right now, she is pretty devastated. ... We're all just praying he recovers soon."" The doctor was splitting his time between New Carrollton, Maryland, and Sierra Leone, where he works at a Methodist hospital. ""He doesn't think of himself as someone important,"" his son, Maada Salia, told WJZ. ""He puts himself down and helps those who really need help."" Salia treated all sorts of patients at the hospital in Sierra Leone -- one of three countries most affected by the deadly virus. ""The fact that he left here and went back to his country, that made me worry a little bit, especially when he's a doctor ... because he doesn't know who has the virus,"" his son said. The evacuation came at the request of his wife, a Maryland resident, who has agreed to reimburse the government for any expense, the U.S. State Department said in a statement. The cost is unknown. Timeline: How the world reacted as Ebola spread . Nebraska Medical Center is one of four hospitals in the United States with biocontainment units and years of preparation in handling highly infectious disease such as Ebola. It has successfully treated two American Ebola patients --  Dr. Rick Sacra, who was released in September, and Ashoka Mukpo, a freelance NBC cameraman who was discharged last month. Both contracted the virus in Liberia and were later flown to the United States for treatment. The virus has killed at least 5,177 people mostly in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, according to the latest figures from the World Health Organization. Of those, Sierra Leone has reported nearly 1,200 deaths in the outbreak, which started this year. Eight of the previous nine Ebola patients treated in the United States survived.

"Days after refusing to rule out recommending U.S. combat troops in Iraq, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff made an unexpected trip Saturday to the turbulent Middle Eastern nation to talk with officials there about combating ISIS, an official said. Gen. Martin Dempsey traveled to Iraq ""to confer (with) Iraqi political and security officials on next phase of the campaign to defeat (ISIS),"" according to a tweet from Brett McGurk, a U.S. diplomat focused on ISIS as well as Iran and Iraq. Pentagon spokesman Jim Gregory added that Dempsey met with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, as well as U.S. Ambassador Stuart Jones and U.S. troops and commanders in the country. Iraqi PM: U.S.-led campaign welcome if 'they do it right' ""The primary purpose of his visit is to get a firsthand look at the situation in Iraq, receive briefings, and get better sense of how the campaign is progressing,"" said Gregory. During the meeting between Dempsey and al-Abadi, the two discussed what to do about ISIS, America's support for Iraq's armed forces, as well as progress made by Iraqi forces, according to a statement from the Prime Minister's office. The troops' victories are part of a strategic plan for liberating all Iraqi territory, and it will be achieved, al-Abadi said. After his Baghdad stop, Dempsey moved north to Irbil, the capital of Iraq's Kurdish region and home to U.S. military advisers and consular personnel. The Joint Chiefs chairman met there with Massoud Barzani, the President of the semi-autonomous region, according to Gregory. Until recently, the Kurdish region had been the most stable in Iraq and a cooperative ally of the United States. But it came under an onslaught earlier this year from ISIS, one that -- so far, at least -- it has been able to withstand. Dempsey's entire trip, which wasn't announced beforehand, is the first since the U.S. military earlier this year launched Operation Inherent Resolve. That's what Washington is calling its military campaign against ISIS, which consists largely of U.S.-led airstrikes against the terrorist group as well as support for the Iraqi military. Christopher Harmer, an analyst with the Institute for the Study of War, said Saturday that it's very important for U.S. military leaders such as Dempsey to get away from Washington and see for themselves how this fight is going. ""I think what General Dempsey is doing here is sending a message both to the U.S. troops that he understands what's happening, that he wants to get firsthand knowledge of what's happening,"" Harmer said. ""And (he is) also sending a message to our allies, the Iraqi government, that he's taking this seriously and that we're committed to an ultimate victory on their behalf."" Dempsey has been one of President Barack Obama administration's leading voices on the situation in Iraq, where ISIS -- which calls itself the Islamic State -- has taken over wide swaths of territory, reportedly terrorizing citizens in the process. Obama has made going after ISIS a top priority in recent months, including expanding coalition airstrikes against the Islamist extremist group into neighboring Syria. Yet he has insisted that American combat troops won't play a role in Syria or in Iraq, though military advisers have recently been sent to Iraq. Yet in testimony Thursday to the House Armed Services Committee, Dempsey said he would not rule out asking the President to send U.S. ground troops into Iraq. He told the committee that he could envision scenarios in which a U.S. ground contingent would be necessary there, particularly if the coalition moves to retake Mosul or the western border with Syria. ""I'm not predicting at this point that I would recommend that those forces in Mosul and along the border would need to be accompanied by U.S. forces,"" cautioned Dempsey, ""but we're certainly considering it.""

"Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican who hails from Kentucky coal country, tried to find some ""middle ground"" with HBO host Bill Maher on climate change, saying Friday night that he supports deregulating alternative sources of energy. ""We need more energy, and maybe cleaner energy will supplant less clean energy over time--and it already is--but I don't think that shutting down dramatically one form of energy is a good idea for an economy,"" the first-term senator said on ""Real Time."" Bill Maher: I had drinks with Rand Paul . While saying he's not against some regulations, such as on carbon emissions and clean water, Paul said he plans on introducing legislation ""in the next month or so"" that would cut regulation of alternative fuels. ""I'm for trying to get the government out of the way of converting your trucks from diesel to natural gas, or from gasoline to ethanol,"" he said. ""And try to let the marketplace take care of this, because some of these fuels are actually cheaper, too, and if they're cheaper then people will go for a cheaper alternative that also is cleaner for the environment."" His comments come as Paul, who's planning a presidential run but says he hasn't made a final decision yet, has blasted President Obama and other Democrats for supporting policies that would negatively affect the coal industry in his home state. He has also gone after the Environmental Protection Agency for what he describes as overbearing regulations. And Paul blasted Hillary Clinton this fall for arguing that climate change is one of the biggest threats facing the United States. On the show Friday, Paul continued to argue that the rhetoric in the climate change debate can be exaggerated. ""It gets so far out there, and it does almost get there with a religiosity that I don't think we need to have,"" he said. ""If we're going to say the Statue of Liberty is drowning, that's alarmist."" Maher, a liberal leaning independent who shares some of Paul's libertarian views, sounded encouraged by Paul's talk on alternative energy but challenged the senator on his point about the discussion surrounding climate change. Joining the Los Angeles-based program remotely from Washington, Paul also answered questions about the recent call to increase the number of troops in Iraq to fight ISIS. ""I'm not for sending any troops into Iraq, and will oppose sending any of our troops back into Iraq,"" he said. Also on the program, Paul reiterated his position in favor of criminal justice reform for nonviolent drug convictions and vowed: ""I will do everything to end war on drugs.""

"(CNN)Imagine discovering a plant that has the potential to help alleviate post-traumatic stress disorder, suicidal thoughts and paralyzing anxiety. That's what some believe ayahuasca can do, and this psychedelic drink is attracting more and more tourists to the Amazon. If you Google ""ayahuasca,"" you'll find a litany of stories about Hollywood celebrities espousing its benefits, as well as the dangers of this relatively unstudied substance that triggers hallucinations. On this Sunday's episode of ""This Is Life,"" Lisa Ling goes inside an ayahuasca ceremony in Peru and talks to the men and women who are drinking this potent brew in hopes that it will alleviate their mental and emotional traumas. Here are six things to know about ayahuasca, which some call a drug and others call a medicine: . Former Marine Lance Cpl. Ryan LeCompte organizes trips to Peru for war veterans, like himself, who are seeking ayahuasca as a possible treatment for PTSD and other emotional and mental trauma suffered after multiple combat deployments. He says he's aware of the risks, as there's very little known about ayahuasca's effect on the body, but he says ""it's a calculated risk."" ""Ayahuasca is a way to give relief to those who are suffering,"" says LeCompte, who says many veterans are not satisfied with the PTSD treatment they receive when they return from combat. ""It's just, 'Here's a pill, here's a Band-Aid.' The ayahuasca medicine is a way to, instead of sweeping your dirt under the rug, you know, these medicines force you to take the rug outside and beat it with a stick until it's clean,"" LeCompte explains. ""And that's how I prefer to clean my house."" Libby, an airman 1st class, is one of the veterans who accompanied LeCompte to Peru to try ayahuasca for her PTSD diagnosis, which includes sexual trauma while on active duty. She says antidepressants made her more suicidal. ""I would like to wish not to die all the time,"" she said, when asked why she was seeking ayahuasca. ""I want that to go away"" As more ayahuasca centers pop up in the United States, not surprisingly, celebrities including Sting and Lindsay Lohan have spoken publicly about their experiences with the substance -- albeit illegal outside of religious purposes in the United States. Lohan, who has struggled with addiction, called her ayahuasca experience ""eye-opening"" and ""intense."" ""I saw my whole life in front of me, and I had to let go of past things that I was trying to hold on to that were dark in my life,"" she said on her OWN reality series ""Linsday."" Sting said he and his wife, Trudie Styler, traveled to a church in the Amazon where they tried ayahuasca, which the British singer said made him feel like he was ""wired to the entire cosmos."" Those of have tried ayahuasca say that any benefits -- like with other drugs or medicine -- must be combined with therapy. ""If you think you're just going to take 'joy juice' ... you're nuts,"" explained author and ayahuasca expert Peter Gorman, who settled in Iquitos, Peru, during the first wave of ayahuasca tourism in the 1990s. ""The five years of work to get rid of [mental trauma] is still gonna be on you."" Gorman, author of ""Ayahuasca in My Blood,"" explains that ayahuasca can help ""dislodge that negative energy"" and show people what their life could be like without the negativity. ""[Then] you can go back home and work on getting rid of it."" And it used to be taken by only the shaman . Gorman says ayahuasca traditions in the Amazon have changed since Western tourists began seeking its benefits. ""Traditionally, the shaman drinks [ayahuasca], he accesses other realms of reality to find out where the dissonance is, that if the shaman corrects, will eliminate the [symptoms] -- could be physical, could be emotional, could be bad luck,"" Gorman explains. ""[Then] we Americans come, and we said we insist on drinking the damn stuff -- we want our lives changed and we want that experience, so that certainly set things right on its head."" You can even buy ayahuasca powders and extracts online and in the local markets in the Peruvian Amazon, but Gorman warns ""you don't know what it would be."" As more and more Western tourists consume ayahuasca, Gorman says it has him worried. ""I've had this feeling in my bones for five or six years that something could go slightly wrong here that could sour a lot of stuff."" In April, 19-year-old Briton Henry Miller died after taking part in an ayahuasca ceremony in Colombia, according to various media reports. And Kyle Nolan, an 18-year-old from northern California, died under similar circumstances in August 2012 in Peru. The shaman who provided Nolan with the ayahuasca and who initially lied about his death was sentenced to three years in prison, his mother, Ingeborg Oswald, told CNN. There have been other reported deaths, as well as reports of physical and sexual assaults. Writer Lily Kay Ross says she survived sexual abuse by an ayahuasca shaman. ""We have to take seriously the potential for harm alongside the huge potential for benefit,"" Ross says on a video on a fundraising website for the Ethnobotanical Stewardship Council. ""Standards of safety and ethics would go a long way in making sure that this kind of abuse isn't experienced by anyone else."" Ron Wheelock, an American shaman who leads an ayahuasca healing center in the Peruvian Amazon, says he fears there may be more deaths. ""I hate to say it, yes there probably will be,"" he told Lisa Ling. ""It's in the cards"" Through IndieGogo.com, the Ethnobotanical Stewardship Council is raising money to create a health guide for ayahuasca centers in the Amazon, so tourists know which centers are safe and harvesting the plants in a sustainable manner that supports the local communities. The idea would be to put the ESC's logo outside ayahuasca ceremony sites to signify those centers that meet the council's criteria for safety and sustainability. In addition, there are efforts to study the medicinal benefits of ayahuasca so that it can be regulated and legalized in the United States, explains Rick Doblin, executive director of the Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies. ""At a time when drug policy is being reevaluated, when marijuana looks like it's on the road toward legalization, when psychedelic medicine is moving forward through the FDA and we can envision a time when psychedelics are available as prescription medicines, how ayahuasca should be handled in a regulatory context is really up in the air,"" Doblin said.

"Vice President Joe Biden emphasized the issue of income inequality to a gathering of major donors and activists Friday night, telling them Democrats will work to address it to help working people, an attendee at the event told CNN. The remarks came during a reception for a coalition of liberal organizations called Democracy Alliance. Biden told the gathering that income in the United States is the most unequal it has been since the 1920s, according to an attendee, who spoke to CNN on the condition he not be identified since it was a private event. Income inequality appeared to be a priority for this audience, and has been a key focus for such leaders as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, who received a warm welcome when she spoke to the group Thursday. The vice president said key Democratic policies and philosophies resonate among Americans. The party had a good message ahead of the most recent election, which ended with Democrats losing seats in the House and losing control of the Senate, but its leaders didn't speak loudly enough to push it, Biden said, according to the source. Not all of the vice president's remarks went over well, including his telling the group that Americans still prefer Democrats despite the electoral drubbing. ""No one responded,"" said the source. Much of Biden's talk Friday was personal in nature. He got emotional, according to the participant, when he recounted how his father could not get a loan for him to attend an Ivy League university -- and he said people in such situations need the country's help. Biden talked about how his children have followed him into public service, despite it not being not the most lucrative profession. He joked he almost wishes he had a Republican kid so that ""his retirement would include a window with a view,"" the attendee quoted him saying. He also got some laughs and applause recounting how he told then-Sen. Barack Obama -- when he accepted his offer to be his running mate in 2008 -- that he would not change his brand, a seeming reference to his reputation for outspokenness and occasional verbal missteps. The former Delaware senator said he speaks his mind and will continue to do so. Biden did not talk about whether he'd run for president, something that he has been openly considering. Nor did he mention the hot-button issue of immigration reform, even as the Obama administration prepares executive action to prevent the deportation of millions of illegal immigrants.","Vice President Joe Biden addressed major donors and activists, attendee tells CNN .

"Washington (CNN) -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie once again flashed the pugnacious attitude that's made him a gladiator to some and a bully to others on Wednesday, telling a heckler to ""sit down and shut up."" The heckler was criticizing Christie's handling of Superstorm Sandy on the second anniversary of the storm that devastated the state's coastline. He held a sign that said: ""GET SANDY FAMILIES BACK IN THEIR HOME -- FINISH THE JOB."" The Democratic group American Bridge posted a video of the incident. Christie warned the man that things would ""get very interesting and very fun"" if he didn't sit down -- but the heckler, seated in the front row during a speech in Belmar, wasn't deterred. ""I'd be more than happy to have a debate with you any time you like, guy, 'cause somebody like you doesn't know a damn thing about what you're talking about except to stand up and show off when the cameras are here,"" Christie said. ""I've been here when the cameras aren't here, buddy, and done the work."" Christie told the man he's ""glad you had your day to show off,"" but that he needed to ""turn around, get your 15 minutes of fame and then maybe take your jacket off, roll up your sleeves and maybe do something for the people of this state."" And Christie went on: ""So listen, you want to have the conversation later, I'm happy to have it, buddy. But until that time, sit down and shut up."" The man appeared to speak directly to Christie, with Christie acknowledging him, before the man moved out of the crowd. ""I'll tell ya,"" Christie said in apparent response to the man, ""there's about a thousand things I'll do tonight. Going to dinner with you is about number thousand and one."" Local news outlets identified the man as Jim Keady, a former Asbury Park councilman whose history of protests includes being deported from Indonesia after railing against Nike's labor practices in the country.","New Jersey Gov.

"The death of a West Virginia University freshman who was found unconscious at a fraternity house has prompted officials to suspend all Greek activities on campus. The announcement by the university follows the death of Nolan Michael Burch, 18, of Williamsville, New York, who was found Wednesday unresponsive at a Kappa Sigma fraternity house in Morgantown, officials said. He died Friday at an area hospital, they said. University and Morgantown police are investigating what had occurred at the house when paramedics were called Wednesday night to the fraternity ""where a catastrophic medical emergency was in progress,"" according to a WVU statement. The university did not detail the circumstances surrounding the death, and the Morgantown Police Department declined to comment, citing an ongoing investigation. Greek activities at the university, including ""all chapter social and pledging activities,"" have been suspended ""until further notice,"" according to a joint statement released by the university, the Inter-Fraternity Council and the Panhellenic Council. Burch's death came a week after ""a disturbance"" involving members of the Sigma Chi Fraternity, Corey Farris, the dean of students, said. That incident is also under investigation by police, he said. The Sigma Chi chapter was suspended by its national chapter and the university after fraternity members were accused of taking 19 fraternity pledges into a residential neighborhood and ordering them to find their way home. The moratorium on Greek activities at WVU will be in place until at least end of this semester. ""Is this just a couple of bad apples? We don't know. We are taking a pause to examine if this some sort of pattern on campus,"" Farris said. The national chapter of Kappa Sigma Fraternity said it was investigating the events surrounding Burch's death. ""This proves difficult, as the operations of this chapter have been suspended since mid-October, due to previous, unrelated violations of Kappa Sigma's Code of Conduct,"" the fraternity said in a statement posted online. ""Subsequently, the chapter and school were notified on Monday, November 10, prior to the event in question, that the group's charter had been withdrawn and its operations had been closed.""Kappa Sigma declined further comment, citing the ongoing investigations. Farris said the university was notified Monday by Kappa Sigma's national office that it had pulled the fraternity's charter. ""No reason was given. But we were told they'd follow up with an official letter,"" he said. While WVU has not received the letter, it suspended the fraternity until at least 2019, Farris said. The suspension of Greek activities at WVU comes two months after Clemson University pulled the plug on two dozen fraternities. Clemson suspended all Greek social and pledging activities following the death of a 19-year-old sophomore, one of a ""high number"" of incidents involving fraternities on the South Carolina campus. Student responds to Clemson's decision . On September 22, Tucker Hipps went for a run with his fraternity and never returned, according to the university. His fraternity brothers searched for him and eventually went to campus police. Hipps' body was found later that day in nearby Lake Hartwell by a bridge. The local sheriff's office said there is nothing to indicate that ""hazing played a part in the death."" An autopsy revealed Hipps sustained a head injury consistent with a fall.","The Sigma Chi chapter at WVU has also been suspended .

"CNN projects independent candidate Bill Walker has won the Alaska gubernatorial race, defeating Republican incumbent Sean Parnell. Walker, a lawyer and local politician, is the second independent to win the seat in Alaska's statehood. The former Valdez mayor and city councilor announced that he would run as an independent in 2013 after Parnell defeated him by a wide margin in the 2010 Republican primary en route to becoming governor. The race was too close to call on election night, with Walker showing less than a 3,000-vote lead over Parnell. Saturday morning, after questioned ballots were adjudicated and early votes, absentee ballots and outstanding ballots had been calculated, Walker led Parnell by just over 4,600 votes. Byron Mallott, a Democratic primary candidate with whom Walker merged his campaign, will become lieutenant governor. The breakdown of governorships starting in January 2015 is now 31 held by Republicans, 17 Democrats and one independent. The outcome of the race in Vermont is still unresolved.

"On the road to democracy, Myanmar has sputtered, and it's time to move forward, said President Obama from the porch of an infamously symbolic home in the country's largest city. Aung San Suu Kyi had been under house arrest there for 15 years for her democracy activism. But on Friday, now a parliamentarian, she stood side by side with Obama, her fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureate. She consoled her compatriots that democracy does not come easy and difficulties don't have to be permanent. He praised democratic progress, particularly an increase in freedom of the press, but then laid his finger in the wounds left by the remnants of military dictatorship and ongoing ethnic tension. Military dominance . Reform is not complete and can still be reversed, Obama said. Military rule has officially ended in Myanmar, which democracy activists call Burma, and the country's first multiparty national elections in 2012, the same year that Obama became the first sitting U.S. President to visit the country. There was much fanfare back then about Myanmar's move towards democracy. But the military still has a major hold on parliament, and Obama called for Myanmar to move to a strictly civilian government. Suu Kyi, more than 20 years ago, was poised to take a leading role in government, but the junta placed her under arrest. She would like to run for President next year, but a legal loophole won't allow it. The Burmese constitution, written by the military in 2008, forbids anyone married to a foreigner to become President. Suu Kyi's husband, who died in 1999, was British. ""I don't understand a provision that would bar someone from (becoming) President because of who their children are, that doesn't make much sense to me,"" Obama said, criticizing it directly. And intimidation is still a problem, the President said. ""People need to feel safe in their homes and not be subject to arbitrary harassment by authorities or individuals acting with impunity,"" he told journalists. Ethnic strife . National elections come back around next year, and Obama urged that ""all people"" need to be able to participate -- placing his finger in one of the most painful wounds, deadly ethnic tensions and inequities. Clashes between minority Muslims, called Rohingyas, and the Buddhist majority in the western state of Rakhine left hundreds dead in 2012, and displaced 140,000. Nearly all of them are still trapped in refugee camps. Their village's were destroyed. The crisis began, when the rape and murder of a Buddhist woman by Muslim men ignited long-standing tensions between the two groups. Obama called for ""durable and effective solutions for the terrible violence in Rakhine state."" Stubborn differences . But the ethnic animosity is palpable and ingrained and will be hard to change, experts have said. ""These are attitudes that don't change in a year, they don't change necessarily in a generation, and they don't necessarily change faster when there is outside pressure,"" said Lex Rieffel, Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution and an expert on South East Asia. Rohingyas are third-class citizens in Myanmar, a long-oppressed linguistic and ethnic minority in an overwhelmingly majority Buddhist country, and Obama called for an end to the discrimination. Myanmar's government refuses to recognize the term Rohingya, calling them instead Bengali and saying they are illegal immigrants, despite the fact that many have been in the country for generations. It has also denied them the right to citizenship. Even Suu Kyi, who won a seat in parliament in 2012, has come under criticism for staying largely silent on the Rohingya crisis. In addition to the Rohingyas, many more ethnic groups on the outs with the rest of society. At least 11 of them have participated in armed rebellion, according to the CIA World Factbook. The government has negotiated peace treaties with 10 of them. Suu Kyi: It's doable . Suu Kyi sounded more optimistic about the prospects of overcoming the difficulties. ""These differences are part of the democratic tradition,"" she said. ""Democracy allows people to have different views. And democracy makes us also responsible for negotiating an answer to those views."" In the end, all people in Myanmar should feel welcome and work together towards a better day. She also warned against over optimism, saying this could lead to complacency, and she put the country's difficulties into long term perspective. ""Our reform process is going through, let us say, a bumpy patch,"" she said.  But getting through it is possible, and Myanmar can make its way into the future.","Obama: reforms are not complete and can be reversed .

"Thanks to climate change, you'll be more likely to get struck by lightning as the years pass, scientists say. Make that 50% more likely for those who are around at the end of the century. ""With warming, thunderstorms become more explosive,"" says University of California Berkeley climate scientist David Romps. He and his colleagues studied 11 climate models to arrive at their calculations, which they published in Friday's issue of the journal Science. The logic is simple. More warmth equals more water vapor in the air, which is the fuel for thunderstorms. That equals more lightning and more of it zapping the ground. And people standing on it. 15 electrifying lightning photos . The current odds of becoming a human lightning rod in one's lifetime come in at around 1 in 12,000, the National Weather Service roughly estimates. If Romps and his colleague are right, those odds would slim to 1 in 8,000 by the year 2100. Certainly, many people are satisfied to live with that level of personal risk. But Romps offers for consideration that lightning strikes also spark half of all wildfires. And fires caused by lightning are harder to put out, he says. While working up the long-term predictions, Romps and his colleagues came upon a useful way of predicting the frequency of lightning strikes in the here and now. They found they could determine fluctuations in that frequency if they knew the amount of precipitation falling and the speed and occurrence of ""convective clouds"" rising high into the atmosphere. Then they studied the 11 models on projected global temperature increases to predict how much these two factors should surge in the distant future, resulting in more lightning strikes if carbon dioxide emissions continue on their current path.","Warming means more water vapor in the air, says UC-Berkeley climate scientist .

"Gerry Goffin, a hit songwriter and former husband of Carole King, died early Thursday. He was 75. Together with King, he wrote such classics as ""The Loco-Motion,"" ""Will You Love Me Tomorrow"" and ""Up on the Roof."" King described Goffin as her first love. ""He had a profound impact on my life and the rest of the world. Gerry was a good man and a dynamic force, whose words and creative influence will resonate for generations to come,"" she said in a statement. ""His words expressed what so many people were feeling but didn't know how to say. If you want to join his loved ones in honoring him, look at the names of the songwriters under the titles of songs,"" King added. The lyricist died at home of natural causes, according to a statement from his publicity agency. Goffin's repertoire of hits ran across decades, from the early 1960s through the late 1990s, and includes some of the most familiar songs of modern times. Born in Brooklyn, Goffin met King when they were students at Queens College, according to a biography on the Songwriters Hall of Fame website. They married in 1959. Their big break came soon after with ""Will You Love Me Tomorrow,"" which was recorded by The Shirelles. Luminaries like The Beatles and Whitney Houston also performed his songs. Among Goffin's other hits are: ""Saving All My Love For You"" with Michael Masser, ""Who Put The Bomp"" with Barry Mann and ""I've Got To Use My Imagination"" with Barry Goldberg.

"While he awaits the next legal steps in the death of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, Jesse Matthew appeared in court Friday to answer charges on another case -- an alleged abduction, sexual assault and attempted murder from nearly a decade ago. During a brief appearance at the Fairfax County Courthouse in northern Virginia, Matthew only uttered two words -- ""Not guilty"" -- to all three charges related to the September 2005 incident. Judge Dennis Smith set a trial date of March 9. The trial is expected to last six or seven days. Authorities say that on September 24, 2005, a 26-year-old woman was returning from a grocery store in the city of Fairfax when someone grabbed her from behind and sexually assaulted her. ""We saw her purse on the front sidewalk,"" said neighbor Stacey Simkins. ""He had already dragged her behind our units to the dark pool area."" The FBI would say later that ""the offender was scared away by a passerby."" It wasn't until last month that a Fairfax County grand jury indicted Matthew in that case. The October 20 indictment came two days after authorities found what turned out to be Graham's skull and bones on an abandoned property eight miles from where the University of Virginia sophomore was last seen. The 18-year-old Graham went missing before dawn on September 13 after being last spotted on several surveillance cameras in Charlottesville's Downtown Mall area. Surveillance video and other accounts led authorities to identify Matthew as the suspect in her disappearance. Matthew was taken into custody September 24 on a beach in Galveston County, Texas, about 1,300 miles away from where Graham was last seen. The victim in the 2005 case was able to provide enough of a detailed description to yield a police sketch. Years later, that information would link Matthew to the case of another missing young woman -- Morgan Harrington, a Virginia Tech student who vanished in Charlottesville in October 2009 and was found dead a few months later. Prosecutor: Victim will fly from India to testify . At Friday's court hearing, lawyers for the 32-year-old Matthew waived the hearing of the charges against him. But according to the indictment in the 2005 case, he ""did feloniously, willfully, deliberately, intentionally and with premeditation attempt to kill (the victim) in the commission of or subsequent to an abduction with the intent to defile."" The woman now lives in India and is prepared to fly to the United States to testify in the upcoming trial, Fairfax County Commonwealth's Attorney Ray Morrogh told reporters Friday. ""This is a difficult process for anyone, and for us to step back into her life so many years later (can be very difficult),"" Morrogh said of the woman, who was 26 at the time of the attack. ""I know that she is grateful ... I'm just so pleased that she is cooperating. And she has just been really a saint to me."" In addition to the victim's potential testimony, the FBI also said it has DNA evidence in the case. Lawyer seeks sanity test for Matthew . One of Matthew's lawyers late last month tried to introduce a motion late seeking a sanity evaluation for his client. But a judge cut defense attorney James Camblos short, saying that motion could be filed and considered later, once a judge was permanently assigned to the case. Camblos wasn't in court Friday, and there was no mention then of another mental evaluation request. Matthew is charged with abduction with the intent to defile in the Graham case. He has not yet been charged in the 2009 case. Analysts say he may be tried first in Fairfax County, because authorities there have had more time to build their case, and they have potential eyewitnesses in addition to the DNA evidence. Speaking about the timing of the two cases, prosecutor Morrogh said that ""on a personal level, I'd like to get it going thinking about my victim. ... On the other hand, I recognize the situation and I'm totally flexible. Whatever the right to do is, that's what we'll do.""","Jesse Matthew pleads not guilty to abduction, sexual assault and attempted murder .

"CNN's John King and other top political reporters empty out their notebooks each Sunday to reveal five things that will be in the headlines in the days, weeks and months ahead. Our trip around the ""Inside Politics"" table was rich with 2014 insights, including a key test in Texas and questions about whether a GOP Senate majority would bring a new chapter in President Obama's relationship with the man he may face in many high-stakes negotiations. 1. A ripple or a wave? In the House, the 2014 margin matters . There is little drama about control of the House of Representatives: Republicans are all but certain to hold -- and build -- their majority. But the number matters. Modest gains for the GOP, and maybe the Democrats sweep back into power in 2016; larger gains and perhaps we see a GOP majority until after the post-2020 Census redistricting. Jonathan Martin of The New York Times took us inside the calculations, and showed how the results could impact the next step for the Republican in charge of the House campaign effort. ""If they get 12 to 15 (seats) or even beyond that, it could make it really hard for Democrats to retake the House until they redraw the lines after 2020,"" said Martin. ""I talked to the chairman of the (National Republican Congressional Committee), Greg Walden, on Saturday, and he lowballed the gains to me at six to eight. Most folks think it will be a little higher than that."" ""And notably, by the way, Chairman Walden said he wants to stay at the NRCC. There's been chatter about him being forced out. He said: 'I'm staying.'"" 2. Mr. President, meet Mitch McConnell . Obama and GOP Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky served together in the Senate, and of course have been political rivals for the past six years. Democrats point to the pledge from McConnell early in the Obama administration to do all he could to make the president a one-term commander in chief. But despite being on the opposite sides of big political battles -- or maybe because of that fact -- the two have a virtually nonexistent personal relationship. Even less interaction -- and familiarity -- than the President has with House Speaker John Boehner. Dan Balz of The Washington Post noted that this would be the most important relationship in Washington if McConnell becomes the Senate majority leader come January. He raised the question of whether the two will make mutual efforts to get to know each other better. 3. Will Democrats see encouraging signs, or learn ""Don't mess with Texas""? Democratic hopes of winning the Texas governor's race have faded, big-time. But the party still has a lot at stake in Tuesday's election, which will add new data to the debate about whether the state's shifting demographics are moving the state away from its Republican red roots. Nia-Malika Henderson of The Washington Post reported that Democrats are hoping, even while expecting defeat in the state's top race, to see building blocks of a new Texas coalition. ""Democrats have poured roughly $10 million into that campaign as part of Battleground Texas -- really hoping to change the makeup of the electorate,"" said Henderson. ""If that electorate isn't changed come Tuesday, Republicans are going to have something to crow about. And it will send a message to Democrats -- don't mess with Texas, at least no time soon."" 4. Waiting for Clinton until March, April or May? The 2016 presidential campaign has been a big subplot of the 2014 midterm season, but will get even more attention once all the votes are counted Tuesday. And some Democrats think the best thing Hillary Clinton could do for the party is to end the suspense, if there is any, and officially declare she is running. Others, though, say why rush, given her overwhelming advantage among Democrats. CNN's Peter Hamby took  us inside a debate that is about to get a lot more attention. ""That big galaxy of people around her are debating should she get in early, very quickly, deny oxygen to any potential challenger, build an organization so she can start raising money, hiring staff, polling, et cetera -- or should she wait until the spring,"" said Hamby. ""I talked to one Democrat who said she should wait until March, April or May because she doesn't have to get into the mix and answer questions from reporters and take every arrow coming at her from the media or Republicans. "" 5. Two big wins for Obama, but deep gains for the GOP . Republicans complain about Obama with every breath, but you can make a case they will miss him. Yes, the President has won two convincing Electoral College victories, and in the process exposed profound GOP demographic weaknesses when it comes to presidential politics. But down the ballot, the Obama years have been boom times for the GOP. Consider the ""then"" and ""now"" at several levels: . • Democrats had 257 House seats and the majority at the beginning of Obama's term; now they are in the minority, with 201. • There were 27 Democratic governors at the beginning; 21 now. • The number of Democrats in state legislatures -- a key proving ground for future stars -- is down a whopping 600 over the past six years. • In the Senate, this year's biggest battleground, the change is less dramatic: 57 Democratic senators early in the Obama presidency, 53 now, or 55 if you count the two independents who caucus with the Democrats. Any president's party normally take a big hit in the so-called ""six-year itch"" midterm, so it will be worth looking again at those numbers in a week. But if Republicans fail to take control of the Senate, given the favorable climate and map this year, the political conversation is likely to be as much, if not more, about the GOP's damaged brand as it is about the numbers showing how the party has prospered these past six years.","The GOP margin in the House could determine congressional control until 2020 .

"A judge on Friday ruled against Arizona, dismissing its claims ""in their entirety"" against the federal government over its enforcement of immigration laws. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton is an apparent blow to Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer and her allies, who last year passed a controversial law known as SB 1070. The Obama administration has challenged Arizona, claiming that enforcing immigration matters is the exclusive responsibility of the federal government. And in a separate ruling in July 2010, Bolton blocked four key elements of the state legislation from taking effect -- including one requiring local police officers to check a person's immigration status while enforcing other laws. This past August, state officials filed a petition to overturn that ruling, with Brewer saying she wants the U.S. Supreme Court to decide the matter. Arizona has argued that the law aims to merely assist and cooperate with federal authorities, which it says Congress has blessed. The focus of Friday's ruling was Arizona's counterclaim to a federal lawsuit intent on blocking SB 1070. Brewer released a statement Friday calling Bolton's latest decision ""to dismiss Arizona's suit against the federal government ... frustrating but not entirely surprising."" ""It is but the latest chapter in a story that Arizonans know all too well: The federal government ignores its constitutional and statutory duty to secure the border. Federal courts avert their eyes. American citizens pay the price,"" the statement said. Passed last year, the Arizona law aimed to ""discourage and deter the unlawful entry and presence of aliens and economic activity by persons unlawfully present in the United States."" In its counterclaims to the federal lawsuit, Arizona stated that Washington does not have ""operational control"" over the Arizona-Mexico border, fails to protect  Arizonans from invasion and domestic violence and hasn't lived up to its statutory responsibility to enforce immigration laws. Arizona also cited the 10th Amendment, which states that powers not delegated to federal authorities rest with the states. But Bolton wrote in her ruling that the ""invasion clause protects against 'armed hostility from another political entity' and does not permit Arizona to sue the federal government for its alleged failure to protect the state from unlawful immigration."" Bolton also said it is up to the political branch, not the courts, to decide if the ""domestic violence clause"" applies to the immigration debate. Arizona also argued that it faces greater costs due to what it calls federal authorities failure to properly address immigration -- including to ""provide education, medical care and other benefits"" to illegal immigrants in violation of the Tenth Amendment."" The judge countered, claiming ""Arizona does not point to any federal immigration policy that mandates or compels Arizona to take action."" ""The complained of expenditures arise entirely from Arizona's own policy choices and independent constitutional obligations and are not incurred as a result of any federal mandate. These state costs do not give rise to a claim under the Tenth Amendment,"" she wrote. Arizona also alleged that the federal government ""failed to comply with and enforce federal immigration law,"" including a requirement that the U.S. Homeland Security department have ""operational control"" of the border and construct at least 700 miles of barriers. The judge found that these laws don't require ""any discreet action 'with the clarity necessary to support judicial action,'"" noting that the term ""operational control"" is broad and that there are no deadlines for the fencing, infrastructure or other developments. In her statement following Bolton's ruling, Brewer vowed that the state's efforts on the matters would continue. ""This decision makes it even more critical that the U.S. Supreme Court hear our defense of SB 1070,"" she said.

"The 2014 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony Thursday celebrated some of the industry's greatest legends the best way it knew how: by turning up the music. Along with the typical acceptance speeches at the 2014 event were some performances so awe-inspiring one of them kept going long after the show was done. Held in Brooklyn's Barclays Center, the Rock Hall of Fame welcomed six new members: Nirvana, KISS, Hall & Oates, Cat Stevens (now known as Yusuf Islam), Linda Ronstadt and Peter Gabriel. Gabriel was the first to take the stage on Thursday, performing his cut ""Digging in the Dirt"" from 1992's ""Us."" He then brought out Coldplay's Chris Martin -- who gave Gabriel's induction speech -- to duet with him on ""Washing of the Water,"" followed by a performance of ""In Your Eyes"" with Senegalese musician Youssou N'Dour. Perhaps Gabriel helped set a mood of kindness and peace, because when all four original members of KISS took the stage there wasn't a trace of their famous animosity to be seen. Inducted by Tom Morello -- a known KISS fan who crowed that ""Kiss was never a critics' band. Kiss was a people's band!"" -- Gene Simmons, Ace Frehley, Paul Stanley and Peter Criss seemed sincere when they accepted their honor. ""This is a profound moment for all of us. We are humbled that the fans gave us the chance to do what we love doing,"" Simmons said. ""And so I'm here just to say a few kind words about the four knuckleheads who, 40 years ago, got together and decided to put together the band that you see on stage, critics be damned. ... We wouldn't be here today without the initial Fantastic Four."" There wasn't a performance from KISS, but there were plenty more to look forward to: Stevens gave a rendition of ""Father And Son"" accompanied by an acoustic guitar, Hall & Oates performed classics like ""I Can't Go For That,"" and the E Street Band took on ""The River"" and ""Kitty's Back"" after receiving the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's Award for Musical Excellence from none other than the Boss himself. ""I thank you my beautiful men and women of E Street,"" Springsteen said in a speech that dug back to the group's very beginning. ""You made me dream and love bigger than I could have ever without you. And tonight I stand here with just one regret: that (the late) Danny (Federici) and Clarence (Clemons) couldn't be with us here tonight."" And then, there was the tribute to Nirvana, eerily timed to come within days of the 20th anniversary of Kurt Cobain's death. R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe inducted the landmark rock group, calling them ""singular, loud and melodic and deeply original. ... Nirvana defined a moment, a movement for outsiders, from the fags and the fat girls to the shy nerds and the goth kids in Tennessee and Kentucky, for the rockers to the awkward to the too-smart kids and the bullied. We were a community."" That community included Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, who was subdued Thursday when she took the stage to accept the recognition along with Dave Grohl, Krist Novoselic and members of Cobain's family, including his mother. ""He would have been so proud,"" Cobain's mother, Wendy, said of her son. ""He'd say he wasn't, but he would be."" While some may have been expecting Love to embrace her Love-ness and deliver one of the most talked about moments of the night, she was focused on family. ""I have a big speech, but I'm not going to say it. ... This is my family I'm looking at right now,"" she said, as she pushed past her tension with Grohl to walk over to him and give him a hug. ""I just wish Kurt was here to see this,"" she concluded. For their performance, Nirvana recruited some top talent, from Joan Jett to Kim Gordon to Lorde, to help them light a fire with ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and ""All Apologies."" According to Pitchfork, their collaboration continued into the early hours of Friday morning as Nirvana, joined by St. Vincent, Joan Jett and Kim Gordon, headed over to a secret show.","The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted a new class on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- This week, Washington state opened recreational marijuana stores for the first time. And these stores don't just carry your father's kind of weed. In addition to highly potent cigarettes -- which are much stronger than those some people might remember from Woodstock -- stores will also soon sell super-strength, pot-infused cookies, candies, sodas, vapor and wax concentrates. Time will tell what the effects will be, but the state is not the first place to implement such a policy. Colorado started to sell marijuana six months ago. When President Barack Obama stopped by a Denver bar on Tuesday night, it comes as no surprise that someone offered him weed. Colorado's experience with pot legalization can hardly be called a success. In fact, it should be considered a warning for the residents of Washington. Special-interest ""Big Tobacco""-like groups and businesses have ensured that marijuana is widely promoted, advertised and commercialized in Colorado. As a result, calls to poison centers have skyrocketed, incidents involving kids going to school with marijuana candy and vaporizers seem more common, and explosions involving butane hash oil extraction have risen. Employers are reporting more workplace incidents involving marijuana use, and deaths have been attributed to ingesting marijuana cookies and food items. So much for the old notion that ""pot doesn't kill."" Marijuana companies, like their predecessors in the tobacco industry, are determined to keep lining their pockets. Indeed, legalization has come down to one thing: money. And it's not money for the government -- Colorado has only raised a third of the amount of tax revenue they have projected -- it's money for this new industry and its shareholders. Open Colorado newspapers and magazines on any given day and you will find pages of marijuana advertisements, coupons and cartoons promoting greater and greater highs. The marijuana industry is making attractive a wide selection of marijuana-related products such as candies, sodas, ice cream and cartoon-themed paraphernalia and vaporizers, which are undoubtedly appealing to children and teens. As Al Bronstein, medical director of the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center recently said, ""We're seeing hallucinations, they become sick to their stomachs, they throw up, they become dizzy and very anxious."" Bronstein reported that in 2013, there were 126 calls concerning adverse reactions to marijuana. From January to April this year, the center receive 65 calls. And, since Colorado expanded marijuana stores for medical users, peer-reviewed research has found a major upsurge in stoned driving-related deaths (that is not surprising since marijuana intoxication doubles the risk of a car crash). It is little wonder that every major public health association, including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and the American Society of Addiction Medicine oppose the legalization of marijuana. The scientific verdict is that marijuana can be addictive and dangerous. Despite denials by special interest groups and marijuana businesses, the drug's addictiveness is not debatable: 1 in 6 kids who ever try marijuana will become addicted to the drug, according to the National Institutes of Health. Many baby boomers have a hard time understanding this simply because today's marijuana can be so much stronger than the marijuana of the past. In fact, more than 450,000 incidents of emergency room admissions related to marijuana occur every year, and heavy marijuana use in adolescence is connected to an 8-point reduction of IQ later in life, irrespective of alcohol use. As if our national mental illness crisis needed more fuel, marijuana users also have a six times higher risk of schizophrenia and are significantly more likely to development other psychotic illnesses. It is no wonder that health groups such as the National Alliance of Mental Illness are increasingly concerned about marijuana use and legalization. That does not mean we need to arrest our way out of a marijuana problem. We should reform criminal justice practices and emphasize prevention, early intervention and treatment when necessary. But we do not need to legalize -- and thus commercialize and advertise -- marijuana to implement these reforms. The only people better off under legalization are the big companies that stand to profit from sales of marijuana. And we can be sure they will get even richer while public health and safety suffers.

"No charges were filed against George Zimmerman after an alleged altercation with his estranged wife and her father, Lake Mary, Florida, Police Chief Steve Bracknell said Monday. ""Shellie Zimmerman has declined prosecution (after consulting with her attorney),"" Bracknell said. Police answered a 911 call from Shellie Zimmerman on Monday afternoon during which she said George Zimmerman had threatened her and her father with a weapon. Officers detained George Zimmerman but never arrested him, police said. Detectives later came to the home to interview him. The question of the gun became confused later when police told reporters there was no gun involved, but George Zimmerman's attorney told CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 that he believed his client had a firearm on him. ""He acted appropriately. He never took the weapon out,"" said Mark O'Mara, who is also a CNN legal analyst. O'Mara said he never saw the gun. Attorney Mark O'Mara drops George Zimmerman . When asked Monday night by CNN for clarification about the gun, a spokesman for O'Mara's law firm, Shawn Vincent, said there was no update yet. The incident stemmed from a visit by Shellie Zimmerman, who filed for divorce last week, and her father, David Bryant Dean. They came to the house the couple used to share to pick up some of her belongings. George Zimmerman and his wife texted Monday morning, and she told him she was going over to the house, according to a person with whom the family shared the photos of the texts. George Zimmerman came to the house with a friend of his and got into a heated discussion with Dean, O'Mara said. What's at stake in Zimmermans' divorce . During the altercation, Zimmerman smashed his wife's iPad. Shellie Zimmerman called police as George Zimmerman sat in his truck with his friend. On the 911 call, Shellie Zimmerman is breathing heavily when she tells a dispatcher that Zimmerman is still at the house. ""He's in his car and he continually has his hand on his gun, and he's saying, 'Step closer.'  He's just threatening all of us with his firearm,"" she says. Shellie Zimmerman also tells 911 that George Zimmerman punched her father in the nose, then smashed her iPad before getting in his truck. ""I don't know what he's capable of.  I'm really, really scared,"" she says. The incident comes two months after Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, was found not guilty of murder in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida. O'Mara said, ""There was heightened emotion, and a disagreement took place."" O'Mara said Shellie Zimmerman no longer lives at the house, which is owned by her father. TMZ: George Zimmermn visits Florida gunmaker . After he was initially detained by officers, George Zimmerman was interviewed at the house by detectives, Lake Mary police spokesman Zach Hudson said. Zimmerman had offered to turn over surveillance tapes from security cameras at the house to investigators. Shellie Zimmerman called 911 just after 2 p.m. ET, Bracknell said earlier. Police said Dean spoke with first responders but was not treated by paramedics. George's brother, Robert, tweeted after his brother's detention that the public shouldn't ""jump to conclusions."" Shellie Zimmerman's divorce filing last week in Seminole County came after she pleaded guilty to perjury on August 28 for lying about the state of the couple's finances during a bond hearing in April 2012. She had claimed she and her husband were broke, when in reality they had collected about $135,000 in donations. Since his acquittal on July 13, George Zimmerman has been in the headlines several times. In late July, he reportedly helped a family escape from an overturned SUV. A report from the Seminole County Sheriff's Office confirmed his involvement. More recently, Zimmerman has been pulled over in traffic twice. The first time, he was given a verbal warning for a traffic violation in Texas and reportedly told officers he had a firearm in his glove compartment. The second time was in Florida last week, when he was issued a $256 ticket for speeding. Lake Mary is a suburb of Orlando near Sanford.

"Diem Brown, the MTV reality star whose fight against cancer was an inspiration to many, lost that long battle on Friday. She was 32. ""MTV is tremendously sad to hear the news that Diem Brown has lost her long battle with cancer,"" the network said in a statement. ""We send our deepest condolences to her family and friends. Diem was a true fighter and brought passion to everything she touched. We will miss her."" In her absence, many are grieving the loss of a woman who wanted to provide support for all who were facing illnesses. Brown was diagnosed with ovarian cancer when she was 23. At the time, she didn't let the diagnosis or the treatment slow her goals: After having an ovary, several lymph nodes and part of a fallopian tube removed, Brown packed up and set off for Australia to take part in MTV's ""Real World/Road Rules Challenge,"" People magazine reports. In 2012, she faced ovarian cancer for the second time, and in August, she revealed that she had colon cancer. That third round was ""the scariest build up towards my cancer journey,"" Brown told E! ""Both mentally, physically and emotionally the most traumatic. I've been needing some hope to fight for, some light to look forward to at the end of this journey. I find that strength in my family, friends and fans. People I've never met believe in me, I can't let them down! I won't."" It's that fighter's spirit that Brown became known for, both on and off the camera. While she was facing her own struggles, she took the time to blog about her experience for People magazine and established the organization MedGift, a support registry for those facing any kind of illness or health struggle. In a tribute to Brown on Instagram, E!'s Alicia Quarles called her friend her ""earth angel."" ""I've always told you, you are my earth angel,"" Quarles said. ""Now, you are our heavenly angel. I see you dancing in heaven with your mother and grandmother. I promise to live the best life possible for both of us. Thank you for teaching me grace, faith, tenacity and for the gift of Medgift.com You and I will never end. You are my true, dear love."" After her third cancer diagnosis in August, Brown tried to maintain a positive outlook in the midst of what she admitted were some trying times. ""I'm so fortunate to have a platform as I know I'm not the only one out there going through something like this,"" Brown told People. ""I promise to keep trucking along if for nothing else but others who need to know it is possible to beat this horrible disease once and for all!"" The next month brought devastating news, as Brown learned that the cancer found in her colon had spread to her liver and lymph nodes. On Tuesday, the TV personality put out a call for ""prayers, advice, support & outreach"" on Twitter as she was hospitalized in New York. Three days later, she died at 10:22 a.m. Facing cancer for so long changed her, Brown told People in September. ""It sounds like a cliche, but I've only got this one life,"" she said.

"Since the closing of what was the world's best restaurant for many years, life has been busy for Albert Adria. Known as the not-so-secret secret weapon behind the imaginative, acclaimed elBulli on the Catalan coast in Spain, the younger Adria brother was the creator of many of the restaurant's deconstructivist dishes that haunted the ambitions of young chefs around the world. It's difficult to overstate the influence of his work at elBulli under the leadership of his older brother Ferran. ""Picture an armada without a flagship, a solar system without a sun, and that is what high-end Spanish cuisine will look like in the absence of El Bulli,"" was how the New York Times mourned the 2011 closing of ""the world's most influential restaurant."" Coming out of the kitchen shadows in the years since, Adria is generating buzz and critical acclaim with the whimsical bars and restaurants he has opened in Barcelona  -- cocktail bar 41ºExperience, tapas bar Tickets, Japanese-Peruvian restaurant Pakta and Bodega 1900, a casual vermouth bar. Time Magazine highlighted him as ""The Magician of the Moment"" in the magazine's roundup of the most influential people in the gastronomy world. In November, he received a Michelin star for Tickets and another one for 41ºExperience. We caught up with the starred chef in Hong Kong as he prepared for a special dinner featuring his iconic dishes at Catalunya Hong Kong. CNN: Could you talk a little about why elBulli closed? If profitability was an issue, as it has been reported, then why were the dishes not priced higher, given the massive popularity? Albert Adria: My brother had been there 25 years and I had been there 23 years and we came to a conclusion together that it was the best idea to leave it when it was at its top. We were getting older and working for 16 hours a day was getting unsustainable. The problem wasn't the economic side -- that it was never an issue. The problem with this kind of restaurant is the physical and mental exhaustion. So we had to give it a break. CNN: Your new five restaurants (he has another one in the works in addition to the four already open) are not as exhausting? Albert Adria: It's as if I made Ferraris before, and now I make Mercedes. Quality, but different quality. CNN: What are the price points for these new projects? Albert Adria: Tickets are around €80 ($109) per head, 41º Experience has two concepts -- you can go there and have cocktails -- around €12 ($16) each -- and snacks, or a closed menu which is €200 ($273). At Pakta, the price is €130 ($177) and Bodega 1900 is €40 ($55). My next venture Yaguarcan, a Mexican restaurant, will be €50($68) at the bar and €80-€90 ($109-$122) at the restaurant. The restaurants with higher pricing have less capacity. CNN: Are people getting fed up with designer food? Albert Adria: No, absolutely not. It's a cycle. It became popular and a lot of these kinds of restaurants opened but there were still very few very good restaurants. The question is never which style of cuisine is in fashion or not. There are only two kinds of cuisines -- good or bad. And the good always wins. That is clear. These days, I like to go to small but very good restaurants. Thanks to high gastronomy training -- at elBulli for example -- a lot of young cooks are ready to make unbelievable things. Those in their 20s and 30s have a technical capacity that is unbelievable. In Spain, for example, and anywhere really, you can eat very well because of these hundreds of young chefs who have trained with the greats. All of these young chefs have adapted to the crisis and they have started to make all of these little restaurants with a different type of kitchen but one that is very, very good. CNN: Do people taking photos of your food ever make you angry? Albert Adria: It's a reality that people take pictures of all the dishes. There's a good side and a bad side. Obviously, the good side is that they are promoting your dishes, the bad side is that many of the photos are very bad. At 41º Experience for example, the element of surprise is very important but if you type 41º on the Internet, you can see all the menus, which spoils the surprise and is very bad for me. At 41º, the creativity is so important. The restaurant only seats 16, but we have 20 people working there. CNN: Are tapas becoming too cliche? Albert Adria: The concept of tapas is actually a rather difficult one to explain so it's difficult to export the concept to certain countries. In China, the concept of sharing is similar so it's gone down very well, but as for whether it is cliche, it is not really.  As with any type of restaurants, you just have good tapas restaurants and bad tapas restaurants. The good ones do very well. And the quality depends on the quality of the products. The best restaurants uses the best quality products, that is clear. Even when making a pizza, it's important to use the best flour, even the water is important. You must use the best water. The industry is ready to make a lot better products but the problem is that the people are not ready to pay extra for the better product. CNN: What do you think of the Michelin star ratings? Albert Adria: Guides are always good if you are at the top. The game has changed a lot since these paper guides started, and the information the customers are receiving changes very quickly these days. On Tripadvisor for example, there are a thousand comments and you don't know who these people are, whether their opinions can be trusted. At the end of the day there's a lot more information these days but it's very unreliable. There's a saying in Spain that it's better that people talk about you, even if it's bad. I don't agree with that. It should not be about a lot of information, if should be about who is giving the information, and whether it is reliable or non reliable. Another thing, I received two Michelin stars last year, but this did not change anything at my restaurant in terms of reservations. In years past, at elBulli when we were given three Michelin stars, we became flooded with reservations. But now you don't see that and that is reference to how the world of guides has changed. CNN: Do you ever just have a steak? Albert Adria: Usually I don't eat much. In the morning, I make myself a good shake that has everything I need, and throughout the day I have to go try all the food from the restaurants so I don't ever sit down and eat something like a steak. All chefs have this way of life. CNN: What is your perfect day off? Every day is the best day of my life. I'm happy just where I am. So it's hard to think of what I would do on a day off. With five restaurants I am so busy, so it's important to surround myself with a good group of people who make me laugh and happy every day. Otherwise I would go crazy. CNN: Who is the best cook in your family? Albert Adria: My mother!","elBulli's Albert Adria has opened four restaurants in Barcelona .

"Of course it matters. But many if not most Americans see the midterm election two weeks from Tuesday as likely to change little or nothing of consequence. Their lack of interest is part of the price of Washington gridlock and dysfunction. It is nearly impossible to see a path for action of major, controversial issues like immigration reform, a new tax system, or long overdue fixes to the big-money entitlement programs Medicare and Social Security. National Journal's veteran political reporter Ron Fournier sums it up this way: . ""No matter how this goes, we're going to have more gridlock and more politics above policy,"" said Fournier. ""As we turn to 2016, it will be angrier, more frustrated and voters will be angrier, more frustrated and looking for alternatives outside these two parties."" Remember that last part -- especially if independent Greg Orman wins the tight Senate race in traditionally ruby red Kansas. That could send both parties a signal about the public's disgust with politics as usual. But, for now, focus on this year. Democratic-held seats in Iowa, Colorado and maybe New Hampshire are within Republican reach but razor close. And now, Republican-held seats in Kansas, South Dakota and Georgia are in play, giving the Democrats late hope of changing a bad 2014 hand with wild cards. Related: Key races to watch in 2014 . This may be too volatile a year for history to matter, but history usually does matter and it suggests a decent to good Republican election, depending on whether those close races all break one way or the other - as often happens -or play out in a wild night of state-by-state chess. Those two most likely scenarios: . 1. Republicans add a modest number of seats to their House majority, and take control of the Senate with somewhere in the ballpark of 51-54 seats. 2. Republicans add a modest number of seats to their House majority, and Democrats close strong and somehow manage to keep their Senate edge, with either 51 seats or a 50-50 tie in which Vice President Joe Biden breaks ties for the rest of the Obama administration. Either way, neither party is going to be anywhere near the 60 votes it takes to do real business in the Senate. And President Obama, for all the talk of his lame duck status that is already taking hold, would still hold  the bully pulpit and a veto pen. So, even if Republicans controlled both the House and Senate and, even if they somehow came up with the votes to repeal Obamacare, it would trigger perhaps the fastest presidential veto in history. Plus, even if the Republicans run the House and the Senate, they still have their own internal tensions. Take immigration. Speaker John Boehner and (in the event they can achieve a slim Senate majority) new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would like nothing more than to move beyond the immigration impasse that has stymied Washington for years so the GOP can begin to try to repair its crisis with Latino voters. But grassroots anger on this issue is as great as ever, and there would be an internal revolt if Boehner or McConnell embraced even something like legal status for the undocumented. President Obama has said a permanent legal status doesn't go nearly far enough, but the conservative base equates it with amnesty. Moving past immigration, what about the debt? There has been no compromise on entitlement spending in recent years because Republicans want deeper savings than Democrats will support and there has been too much partisan grandstanding to try to work out a compromise. Would total GOP control of Congress make a difference? Maybe: there would be a united GOP negotiating front with the White House, and the President would perhaps be open to more as he considers his legacy and looks for big achievements. Or maybe not: with Republicans shy of 60 votes in the Senate, imagine Elizabeth Warren as the new Ted Cruz. She might do anything she could to gum up the works when something doesn't pass her ideological muster. And don't forget the 2016 campaign begins in earnest the day after the 2014 election. Having been stunned from the left in 2008, would Hillary Clinton would be quiet if major entitlement trims were a possibility? So, bottom line: maybe Mitch McConnell replaces Harry Reid in the role of man with big title -- Senate majority leader -- but little legislative leeway. Voters get this. Just ask the people working their tails off to make a difference. Christian conservative leaders say when their phone banks call voters, a leading response is: ""why bother?"" To that point, in Colorado Springs last week, evangelical pastor Joe Kirkdendall told me the young Christians in his ministry ""don't really look to Washington"" as a place that solves the things they worry about most. http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/15/politics/king-roadtrip-midterm/ . Related: Midterm mile markers - Roadtrip to 2014 . A little more than an hour to the north, in suburban Denver's Adams County, a half dozen Latino voters I chatted with in a neighborhood restaurant had a healthy debate on some issues but all agreed the excitement of voting for President Obama had given way to a sense that every promise to them was certain to be broken. Charlotte Vigil, a volunteer for Democrats in that county, says many voters she calls are ""discouraged."" Discouraged at dysfunction seems to be the state of the union with two weeks to go until election day. But the truth is, whatever your politics, who wins on election night matters more than you might think. Do you want a Democrat or a Republican as Senate Judiciary Committee chairman if President Obama has one or two Supreme Court picks in the next two years? Do you want significant changes to Obamacare? Who controls the Senate will matter bigtime in those negotiations. Republicans want more money for the Pentagon than the White House does, and if they control both chambers of Congress they would have more leverage in budget talks. More leverage, perhaps, to find that money by trimming Head Start of food stamps. That list -- of where it certainly DOES matter -- is a long one. But most voters don't see it because what they have witnessed the past several years leaves them convinced -- understandably so -- that Washington would scew up a free lunch. Take Hannah Zahn, a waitress in Winterset, Iowa, who during a visit last week talked so excitedly about casting her first ballot, just 18, in 2012. She's planning on siting out 2014, because, ""I don't think it really matters. They don't care about me.""","Americans are fed up with dysfunction in Washington .
Does it really matter if Democrats or Republicans are in charge after 2014?"
"The website Humans of New York has been called a lot of things since Brandon Stanton, a bond trader-turned-photographer, launched the popular photo series almost three years ago. What it's not, he says, is a photography blog -- a collection focused just on the images or shooting technique. ""The people and their unique stories make the pictures interesting. On their own, they wouldn't have the same impact,"" Stanton, 29, said in a phone interview this week from his home and studio in Brooklyn. From there, two assistants help him post and maintain the social media accounts he uses to share his diverse images of New Yorkers. Check out CNN Photos, CNN.com's photography blog . Stanton, who grew up outside Atlanta, says he has refined his approach to focus on storytelling in the few years since Humans of New York took off on Tumblr. It's a formula that seems to work no matter where he goes. Stanton is best known for his images of people from the streets of New York, but some of the work of which he's most proud comes from a trip to Iran in 2012. People often remarked upon how his images ""soften"" and ""humanize"" the tough image of New Yorkers, ""so I thought what would it be like to apply that effect to a place that is feared,"" Stanton said. Now, about 50,000 of the website's 1.5 million Facebook followers are from Iran, he says. War & Fashion: Carnage and the catwalk, in photos . This week, his first book of images, ""Humans of New York,"" was published. Here's an edited transcript of a conversation about the book, his rise to fame and what else has changed in the three years since he began to look at his fellow New Yorkers in a different way. CNN: How did the book come about? Stanton: Whenever you get a large body of work like Humans of New York, a natural pathway becomes to put it between two covers. I wanted this to be a very nice keepsake. A lot of work went into it, and a lot of fans are attached to it. I wanted the book to be a piece of art and not just a cost effective way of repackaging the material for mass consumption. CNN: How has your approach changed since you began? Stanton: The approach to the concept started out purely as photography blog. In the first year, I was just taking pictures without captions. Then I started having interactions in streets, and they were evolving to the point where now I can't call it a photography blog because the storytelling is so vital. The approach to the work has changed in that way. CNN: How do you approach people? Stanton: My approach is something that has evolved after getting rejected dozens of times. I say as little as possible now. I don't explain the blog up front unless they ask. I just kindly ask for people's photos, and if they ask what it's for I explain the blog to them. It's easy to over-explain yourself, and it's not really the words you say -- it's about the energy you give off. It took me a long time to learn that.

Stanton: I did one big commercial job. I've turned down tons of jobs from pharmaceutical companies, alcohol, credit cards, but I did extensive commercial work for Amtrak, nine days in seven different cities. But I didn't announce it on the blog. I emphasized to them that I would not be promoting or advertising it on HONY. I will do work as a photographer but will not rent out HONY. CNN: What are some of your favorites? Stanton: I always have a hard time answering that. Any HONY picture in isolation (doesn't) give the feel of the project. The feel of the project is the scope.

"(CNN)The leader of U.S. military efforts to fight ISIS in Iraq says the terror group came within 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) of the Baghdad airport. Offering what appeared to be previously unreported details, Gen. Martin Dempsey told ABC's ""This Week"" that the United States had to risk bringing in low-flying attack helicopters to keep ISIS at bay. ""The tool that was immediately available was the Apache [helicopter]. The risk of operating in a hostile environment is there constantly,"" the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said. ""You're not going to wait until they're climbing over the wall,"" Dempsey said. ""Had [ISIS forces] overrun the Iraqi unit, it was a straight shot to the Baghdad airport. So, we're not going to let that happen."" CNN's Barbara Starr reported October 7 the United States had used the Apache helicopters to push back ISIS forces advancing near Falluja. The aircraft can carry out precise airstrikes but do so at a lower altitude, risking a possible strike by surface-to-air missiles ISIS is known to possess. At the time, Starr reported the United States did not predict ISIS making a direct run for Baghdad. However, there had been general concern that ISIS elements are in the city and around the airport and have been in mortar range for months. Dempsey's comments Sunday clarified for the first time that the Apache was used to protect the Baghdad airport from such an overt threat. The comments came in a wide-ranging interview with ABC""s Martha Raddatz about U.S. efforts to destroy ISIS. Dempsey minced few words about the potential scope of U.S. and coalition involvement and the difficulty of targeting ISIS because of their adaptability. Dempsey created messaging headaches for the Obama administration weeks ago testifying before Congress that if he thought ground troops might be needed at some point, he would recommend it to the White House. President Barack Obama has repeatedly insisted he will not put U.S. forces on the ground and will instead work to advise and train coalition and Iraqi forces to fight ISIS. In Sunday's interview, Dempsey conceded that having U.S. troops on the ground, in theory, would help Iraqi forces spot ISIS targets. But he still insisted the U.S. is not at that point. ""Yeah, there will be circumstances when the answer to that question will likely be yes. But I haven't encountered one right now,"" Dempsey said. ""I'd actually use the example of you know Mosul will likely be the decisive battle in the ground campaign at some point in the future,"" Dempsey said. ""When they are ready to go back on the offensive, my instinct at this point is that that will require a different kind of advising and assisting because of the complexity of that fight."" Meanwhile, coalition partners continue to look to the United States for more military might. Obama has long resisted calls for a no-fly zone over Syria. However, Turkish leaders have repeatedly pressed for one. ""We want to have a no-fly zone. We want to have a safe haven on our border,"" Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in an interview that aired October 6. ""Otherwise, all these burdens will continue to go on the shoulder of Turkey and other neighboring countries."" Dempsey said that while a no-fly zone is not in the works at this point, it can't be ruled out. Coalition airstrikes continued over the weekend in Syria and Iraq. By some assessments, ISIS appeared poised for a victory in the disputed city of Kobani along the Turkish-Syrian border. World leaders have repeatedly warned that should ISIS take the city, residents there could be massacred. ""Whether there are still 5,000 people there or not is, is a matter of conjecture,"" Dempsey said. ""But I have no doubt that ISIL will conduct the same kind of horrific atrocities if they have the opportunity to do so.""","Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey says ISIS almost reached Baghdad airport .

"Dennis Rodman says he's not a diplomat, just a former NBA star fighting addiction and trying to be a better father. But that hasn't kept him from becoming embroiled, even if unintentionally, in U.S.-North Korea relations. His apparent chumminess with North Korea's leader has been controversial, as have previous proclamations that Kim Jong Un is a ""nice guy."" Rodman said he simply does not know enough about the allegations of abuse and authoritarianism that Kim is reviled for. ""I keep telling people, I'm not there to be an ambassador to try to figure out why (is Kim) doing all these things? That's not my job,"" Rodman told CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day"" Friday. It was his first interview since entering an alcohol rehabilitation facility two weeks ago. The former basketball player is probably the American with the most access to the North Korean leader, and many have been critical that he has not lobbied for the release of American prisoner Kenneth Bae from a labor camp. ""I'm not an ambassador, and I tried to strive and tell people, just because I know the marshal (Kim), that doesn't mean I know the marshal like that,"" he said. Rodman says he didn't mean to insinuate during an earlier interview this month that he knew why Bae, a Korean-American, was being held in North Korea. ""To this day I still don't know what he did,"" Rodman said, even offering to take Bae's place if he could. ""I feel for (Bae's family). I feel for them deeply. ... I would do anything literally. This is Dennis Rodman talking. If they (North Korea) said, 'We'll take Dennis Rodman and we'll let Kenenth Bae go,' I'll say, 'You know what? I'll do that. ... Take me.'"" 'I drink... because I'm bored' The North Korea topic was important, but Friday's interview was as much about Rodman's personal struggles with addiction. ""I've always been a party animal,"" Rodman said. But he said this is a great time for him to reflect publicly and put himself at peace with a ""lot of stuff that has been going on"" over the past 18 months. ""I think for me, the reason I drink is because I'm bored,"" he said. ""Am I an alcoholic? Absolutely,"" Rodman said. Asked whether he was drunk during his first interview with Cuomo when Rodman was in North Korea earlier this month, the former NBA star said he drank with his teammates beforehand, but declined to say whether he was drunk. ""It wasn't about me being in the right mind,"" he said. This month, the colorful basketball Hall of Famer, who won five NBA titles with the Detroit Pistons and Chicago Bulls, organized a team of former professional basketball stars to go to North Korea for a game that was played on Kim's birthday. The players were criticized for traveling to the secretive state, a nation accused of human rights abuses. North Korea also has pursued a nuclear program, despite warnings from the United States and other Western powers. Rodman said his actions in North Korea do not make him a bad person. ""I'm not a traitor,"" Rodman said. ""My whole goal is to make people happy."" During the live interview, the former professional basketball player extended an invitation to take Cuomo to North Korea to meet its leader, and decide for himself what kind of person Kim is. Fellow player Charles Smith defended the visit as a mission of basketball diplomacy, where sportsmen would share cultural ideas with each other. While there -- in what was his fourth trip to North Korea -- Rodman spoke to Cuomo in an at-times heated interview. The  sunglasses-wearing Rodman began yelling at the CNN anchor as he defended the team's visit. ""You know, you've got 10 guys here, 10 guys here, that have left their families, they've left their damn families, to help this country in a sports venture. That's 10 guys, all these guys here, do anyone understand that?"" ""We do,"" responded Cuomo. ""And we appreciate that and we wish them well with cultural exchange."" ""No, no, no, no,"" Rodman continued. ""I don't give a rat's ass what the hell you think. I'm saying to you, look at these guys here, look at them ... they dared to do one thing, they came here."" And Rodman also implied that Bae, held prisoner for 15 months by the regime, was guilty of a crime, but he did not specify what offense. ""Do you understand what he did in this country?"" Rodman asked Cuomo, who tried to interject. ""No, no, no, you tell me, you tell me. Why is he held captive here in this country, why?"" ""I would love to speak on this,"" Rodman said, before abruptly switching topic to talk about how his fellow basketball players had left their families behind to come to North Korea for the exhibition game. Bae, of Lynwood, Washington, was arrested in November 2012 in Rason, along North Korea's northeastern coast. The devout Christian and father of three operated a China-based company specializing in tours of North Korea, according to his family and freekennow.com, a website that friends set up to promote his release. Rodman later apologized for his remarks about Bae. And his longtime agent, Darren Prince, said his client had fallen victim to stress and drinking. ""He is embarrassed, saddened and remorseful for the anger and hurt his words have caused,"" Prince said in announcing that Rodman was in rehab.","Rodman says he doesn't know the details of detained American Kenneth Bae's case .

"(CNN) -- As recently as 2011, Hillary Clinton was seen by many as a respected but polarizing figure: Smart and accomplished, sure, but controlled and somewhat humorless. In the infamous faint praise of her rival-turned-boss Barack Obama, she was ""likable enough."" Three years later, she seems somehow hipper, looser and more ... human. As we inch toward the 2016 election, she's presented a new online persona. While Clinton has embraced social media, it hasn't always loved her back, as seen most recently on her current book tour. The Internet has used every opportunity to turn her words and actions into memes, not all of them flattering. So what happened? How did Hillary Clinton suddenly go viral? You can trace the change back to October 18, 2011, when then-Secretary of State Clinton was traveling with her staff on a C-17 military plane from Malta to Tripoli, Libya. Nobody knew its importance at the time, but that's the day Reuters' Kevin Lamarque and TIME's Diana Walker snapped a handful of photos that would soon become iconic: Clinton, in oversize black shades and a no-nonsense expression, checking her BlackBerry at a makeshift desk as staffers mingled behind her. ""Okay, nice image I thought, but we were about to land in Tripoli which was certain to yield the images that the world would really want to see,"" Lamarque wrote in a blog post months later. ""Photographers, you never really know when your pictures will resurface and what use they will be to someone out there."" 5 things to watch in Hillary Clinton town hall . Texts From Hillary . You know the rest. Six months later, the photos were all over the Internet, thanks to two journalists with an idea that started as a joke at a bar. In April 2012, Stacy Lambe and Adam Smith launched a blog, Texts From Hillary, that showed fictional text-message exchanges between Clinton, from her seat on the plane, and a range of celebrities. There she was rejecting a Mark Zuckerberg friend request, telling a flirty Ryan Gosling to call her ""Madame Secretary,"" blowing off Jon Stewart by saying she's already booked on Colbert and responding to Obama's ""Hey Hil, whatchu doing?"" with ""Running the world."" As the perfect vessels for deadpan mockery in the social media age, the posts and related Twitter feed soon were everywhere. Within days, Clinton invited Lambe and Smith to her office at the State Department, where she initiated a group photo of the trio texting on their phones. Although its makers shuttered the blog only a week later -- ""Once you meet the subject of your meme ... it's very hard to top that,"" Smith told CNN -- Clinton's image was altered almost overnight. ""During the 2008 Democratic primary, Barack Obama had a lock on young people, technology chic and the press. Hillary was regarded by kids as the lady who'd been around a long time, wearing headbands and pantsuits,"" Maureen Dowd wrote that week in The New York Times. ""Now she's quick to laugh at herself and take advantage of the positive buzz,"" Dowd continued. Building a brand on Twitter . A few months after Clinton stepped down as secretary of state in early 2013, she joined Twitter. Her first tweet thanked Lambe and Smith for the inspiration and then said, ""I'll take it from here ... #tweetsfromhillary."" It was retweeted more than 10,000 times. And her Twitter bio became an instant classic of the form. It reads: ""Wife, mom, lawyer, women & kids advocate, FLOAR, FLOTUS, US Senator, SecState, author, dog owner, hair icon, pantsuit aficionado, glass ceiling cracker, TBD..."" Soon Clinton was posting childhood photos of husband Bill on his birthday, tributes to the late Nelson Mandela, a portrait of her with members of Russian band Pussy Riot and pleas for such pet causes as elephant poaching and empowering women in the developing world. ""She has really embraced the platform in the right way. She has humanized herself and her brand,"" said Shama Hyder, CEO of the Marketing Zen Group. ""Today, participating in digital media isn't a choice,"" Hyder added.""Your digital footprint is created regardless of your participation, and any smart politician knows that it is best to help curate that image vs. leaving others to define it for you."" Clinton also has shown flashes of self-mocking humor, as when she tweeted a joke during the Super Bowl in February about how she enjoyed watching ""someone else being blitzed and sacked"" on Fox for a change. Today, Clinton, 66, has 1.5 million Twitter followers, many who may not even remember her eight years in the White House. At least for now, she seems more comfortable in her skin -- witness the photos of her wearing thick glasses and almost no makeup -- although that may change if she runs for president again. The Internet isn't always nice . But getting the attention of the Internet is not always a good thing. Anything Clinton says has the potential to go viral, for worse as well as better. In January 2013, Clinton was fighting back criticism before the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee during a hearing about the attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya. ""With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans,"" she said. ""Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they'd go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, senator."" The Twitter-sphere quickly seized on the outburst, and within hours, #WhatDifferenceDoesItMake was trending. Not only did the hashtag spread, but so did a graphic of Clinton's 2008 campaign sign juxtaposed with the phrase ""What difference does it make?"" Earlier this month, as she promoted her new book, ""Hard Choices,"" Clinton was trending again . In an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer, Clinton said she and former President Bill Clinton were ""dead broke"" and ""struggled to piece together the resources"" for mortgages in pricey Washington and the New York suburbs along with their daughter Chelsea's tuition at Stanford University. Clinton sought to clarify her comment, saying simply that she and her husband have known periods in their lives when they struggled to pay off debt, but the damage was done. Her Twitter critics turned #HillaryIsSoPoor into a mocking hashtag. Once and future candidate? Criticism aside, should Clinton run for president in the 2016 election, digital-branding experts believe the reborn, tech-savvy Clinton will resonate better with voters, especially young ones. Marketing guru Marian Salzman believes the old Clinton hid her personality behind the security wall of public service. The new Clinton is undergoing a swift digital makeover, said Salzman, CEO of Havas PR North America. ""How can she modernize, and fast? Get online and exude an ageless hipster style that takes away the pain of the proximity between her age and the age of Ronald Reagan (69) when he took office,"" Salzman told CNN. ""The sudden burst of intellectual energy, even in 140 characters, reinforces she is of these times and living the now."" Salzman believes Clinton must be her authentic self on social media to appear more relatable to voters. ""She needs humor and self awareness -- we don't want Mrs. Thatcher,"" she said, referring to the sometimes imperious former British prime minister. ""She needs to be of the people, and with them."" It can't hurt to keep posting more personal messages such as her ""My most exciting title yet: Grandmother-To-Be!"" tweet congratulating Chelsea and husband Marc Mezvinsky on expecting their first child. Hyder, of the Marketing Zen Group, believes Clinton still wants to be president and has realized ""she can no longer sit on the sidelines"" when it comes to digital media. ""I believe it has helped her garner many new fans and will continue to play a huge role in building her brand,"" Hyder told CNN. ""The last time Ms. Clinton had presidential aspirations, there wasn't a strong sense of her as a person. The public had a very one dimensional image. ""Using digital media in this way allows her to present a fuller ... more human picture. If she does decide to run, it could be a decisive factor."" CNN's Dan Merica contributed to this report.","Hillary Clinton has increased her presence on social media .
Her rebirth can be traced to the ""Texts From Hillary"" meme in 2012 .

"The Ferguson, Missouri, police chief insisted Thursday that he won't step down -- despite continued unrest months after one of his officer's fatally shot Michael Brown and high-level talks that could lead to his exit. ""I'm going to stay and see this through,"" Chief Thomas Jackson told CNN. The firestorm around Jackson began August 9, when Officer Darren Wilson, who is white, shot Brown, an African-American teen. Wilson's defenders have said he acted in self-defense, while Brown's backers note the teenager wasn't armed and claim he had his hands up when the fatal bullets hit him. The incident roused large and, at times, violent demonstrations in Ferguson. Jackson faced criticism over his department's handling of the Brown shooting and the subsequent protests. Government officials say that Jackson's future is part of talks involving local, state and congressional officials. Part of that discussion centers on what severance package the chief might get, as well as who would manage the Ferguson police department instead of him. Whether the chief wants it or not, the collective decision has been made that the Ferguson police will move ahead without him, according to the officials. All sides taking part in the talks had hoped Jackson would be able to step down on his own accord, instead of being forced out. But Jackson gave no indication Thursday that he'll leave voluntarily, saying he plans to stay as long as the city manager and council support him. ""I certainly have the support of the police department and the community. I have a lot of support in the community,"" he said. ""I think this is my job to complete, and I'm going to do it."" The situation in Ferguson remains unsettled. Wilson's fate is up in the air: He hasn't been charged, though a grand jury is hearing evidence and will determine whether to indict him. And activists haven't shown any sign they're ready to give up in pushing for Wilson's prosecution and other, broader changes in Ferguson. Amid it all, Jackson says that ""this happened on my watch, and I intend to see it through,"" he told CNN. ""I think I'm very capable of doing that, and I have a lot of people behind me that believe so as well."" Investigation . The Justice Department is investigating Ferguson police. Investigators are looking at the department's use of force over the years; analyzing stops, searches and arrests; and examining the treatment of people detained at the city jail, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has said. Holder has said the Justice Department's investigation includes the department's leadership. Some officials have expressed a desire to dissolve the entire department and turn over law enforcement to St. Louis County police. Complete coverage of Ferguson shooting and protests . ""We're looking at a whole variety of things, including the leadership of that department, the practices that the department engages in, the nature of the interaction between the department and the community that it is supposed to serve,"" Holder said. Holder has declined to comment on whether the police chief should be removed, but he has not been shy about expressing his views. ""It's pretty clear that the need for wholesale change is appropriate,"" he said this month. Jackson has found fault with Holder's remarks. ""He's drawn a conclusion that wholesale change needs to be made,"" said Jackson. ""We have a lot of good stuff going on, so I think he needs to be a little more specific."" The police chief also defended the handling of the sometimes violent protests in the wake of the shooting. ""There was firebombs thrown. There were shots fired, for several nights in a row, shots fired at police officers and vehicles. And through all of that, the tactics that were used resulted in no injuries to any protesters or police officers. So, that's actually something to be quite happy about,"" Jackson said. Apology . Last month, Jackson released a video apology directed at Brown's parents and the peaceful demonstrators who took to Ferguson's streets to protest the teen's death. In particular, he apologized that his department left Brown's body in the street for four hours after the shooting, and for his department's failure to protect the demonstrators' right to assemble. He acknowledged that the incident had sparked a larger conversation about societal issues, saying Ferguson and the surrounding areas have ""much work to do."" ""Overnight, I went from being a small-town police chief to being part of a conversation about racism, equality and the role of policing in that conversation. As chief of police, I want to be part of that conversation. I also want to be part of the solution,"" he said. ""For any mistakes I've made, I take full responsibility. It's an honor to serve the city of Ferguson and the people who live there. I look forward to working with you in the future to solve our problems, and once again, I deeply apologize to the Brown family,"" he said. Later that day, he waded into a crowd at a protest and apologized again. Some people seemed satisfied by his apologies, but not everyone was eager to hear from him. One man shouted into a bullhorn, ""If you are not resigning tonight, go home."" What's next? Part of why he wants to stay, Jackson said, is because he finds it painful to watch what's happening in his community. He said he wants to help heal it. Although the department has done a lot around the issue, police need to work harder on minority recruitment and retention, the chief said. Ferguson is a predominantly black community with a mostly white police force. At the time of Brown's shooting, only three of the city's 53 officers were African-American. Police can also put more of an emphasis on community-oriented policing and problem-solving, Jackson said. Asked whether those sort of changes will be enough to restore calm, the chief replied: ""What's enough is sort of dependent on what's the right thing to do, and that's what I'm focused on."" But he knows the issue is much bigger than one person. ""I'm just one of the players. This is going to take the entire community,"" Jackson said.","Officials: There's a collective decision Ferguson will move on without Jackson .
Officials says chief's future is part of  talks, including what severance he'd get .
Ferguson chief says he has ""a lot of people behind me,"" wants to finish the job in city .

"(CNN) -- The Amanda Bynes saga continues. Early on Saturday, TMZ posted audio purporting to be of Bynes saying she wanted to murder her father. In the tape, she is heard telling someone that she wants her family dead because they control her money. On Sunday, the actress released a statement to ""Access Hollywood"" seeming to apologize for what she said on the recording and trusting the people who recorded her. ""I'm sorry I trusted people who clearly were not my friends and capitalized on my illness,"" she said. ""I am doing my best to get better. I am truly sorry for the statements I made. I am sorry for any pain I caused my family and others."" The statement went on: ""I am thankful for everyone's patience and understanding. I never expected others to take advantage and profit from my condition. I'm disappointed with those who lulled me into a false sense of security only to find out they really are only interested in selling my privacy to the media."" CNN has not independently verified the TMZ recording was of Bynes. Earlier, Bynes tweeted that she was joking about wanting to kill her father. ""I straight up don't believe in harming a soul,"" she posted. This is the latest kerfuffle involving the 28-year-old Bynes after someone tweeted from her Twitter account that she was bipolar in October. She later blamed a ""friend"" for tweeting that out.","Amanda Bynes has reportedly apologized for threatening her father .

"When does the ordinary -- letters, gloves, wallets -- become extraordinary? When the objects tell a story: a stack of personal letters that fell to the ground after a hijacked plane plowed into the World Trade Center; leather gloves worn in the recovery effort; a red wallet belonging to a woman who worked for Cantor Fitzgerald. Tragedy turns the mundane into memorial. Something as simple as a wallet can evoke the immense sadness of a day like September 11, 2001. Objects big and small from the greatest terrorist attack on American soil now make up a museum dedicated to that tragedy and the 2,983 people who perished. It is one of America's largest and most ambitious memorial museums, almost entirely subterranean and erected in the graveyard of Osama bin Laden's victims. A police officer found Genni Gambale's red wallet on the roof of a Marriott hotel, a few blocks south of the Trade Center,  days after the attacks. In the wallet were a scorched American Express Corporate card, a $115 coupon for Lenscrafters, a Brooklyn Public Library card, pennies, nickels, dimes. Now under thick Plexiglass, the wallet tells of a life cut short. Gambale was one of many trapped on the upper floors after American Airlines Flight 11 plowed into the North Tower at 8:46 a.m. She was 27. The National September 11 Memorial Museum opened in May for the 9/11 community -- survivors, families, rescuers. Shortly after it opened to the general public. The place in itself is an artifact, built in the bedrock of tragedy. Within it are 12,500 objects, 1,995 oral histories and 580 hours of film and video. ""An airplane hangar full of largely bruised, contorted artifacts"" formed the basis of the museum, says curator Jan Ramirez. They are objects that cheated destruction. They survived the obliteration of the material world and assumed an otherworldly quality. But they also could inflict pain again. From the beginning, Ramirez and all those who worked under museum director Alice Greenwald faced a flurry of contradictions and dilemmas over what to show, how much to reveal. Where the twin towers once soared are now two sunken granite pools, positioned in the footprints of the giant buildings that came crashing down that day. They are meant to be places of reflection and mourning. What was the museum's intent? Was it to illustrate a narrative of what happened on September 11? Or would it be a repository for the study of an American tragedy? If it were the latter, the museum would have to collect objects much more broadly. ""We decided to take that path. We decided to be ambitious and daring,"" Ramirez said. But with that decision came new concerns and obstacles. How do you portray horror without overwhelming people who come to visit? How do you memorialize things that people might rather not remember? The museum, said Ramirez, is sure to be emotionally overwhelming to anyone who survived September 11, to all New Yorkers, and perhaps even to the millions of people who watched the events of that day unfold on television. She described the helmets of firefighters that were donated by their families. Some were so brutalized that it's not hard to imagine the severe trauma to the heads those helmets were meant to protect. ""We all had our different thresholds about what was the right thing to do,"" Ramirez said. ""We want to remind people why 9/11 was unlike any other day the country has experienced. But we did not want to cross a threshold where a visitor's empathy shuts down. That would be a horrible misfire of our objectives."" So some things in the museum are clearly marked and separated in alcoves. In one section are images of people jumping to their deaths from the towering infernos. ""In the end we felt this was part of the morning's indelible horror,"" Ramirez said. ""To edit that out might arouse suspicion about what else we edited out."" The museum collected items from survivors, families of the dead, first responders, cleanup workers and agencies that were part of the investigation. Objects like Gambele's wallet were precious to families. In many cases, bodies were never recovered or identified. Objects were all the families got back. Other objects mean something to survivors. Hazem Gamal worked for OppenheimerFunds on the 34th floor of the South Tower. He stored personal letters in a filing cabinet in his office. In December 2001, a demolition consultant, Ray Coleman, discovered the letters amid the rubble. He was amazed by them. Nothing else Coleman had seen was discernible. No chair, table, computer.  Everything was pulverized or mangled beyond recognition. But these letters were intact, only slightly singed and waterlogged. The clip holding them together had rusted. Coleman kept the letters for a year. He was afraid that if he called the owner, he might learn that he had died. Finally, in November 2002, he dialed Gamel's home. Then he returned the letters. He included this note written in pencil on engineer's paper: . ""I hope that you will cherish these papers, and cherish your family,"" he wrote. ""If this project did anything for me, it has taught me to love every minute, love my family and friends, and take time to do the things that are really important."" Others donated personal property that helps viewers understand their loved ones better. Brian Sweeney's wife donated a handmade Viking helmet; he was so proud of his Viking heritage. ""It creates a sense of joy,"" Ramirez said. ""They were enjoying life. It's the opposite of the ideology of ending life."" Sweeney, a former Navy pilot, was on United Airlines Flight 175. His last words to his wife were recorded in a voice mail shortly before the hijacked plane crashed into the South Tower: . ""If things don't go well, and it's not looking good, I just want you to know I absolutely love you. I want you to do good, go have good times. Same to my parents and everybody, and I just totally love you, and I'll see you when you get there."" New York police officer David Brink donated a suitcase full of things to the museum, including a pair of gloves he picked up in a hospitality tent set up at ground zero. Brink, like other recovery workers, used his hands to scour through a wasteland of debris. He had to change out his gloves frequently because they got so damaged. One day, he picked up a pair of leather gloves and didn't notice until later, when he was in the wreckage, that someone had taken a ballpoint pen to the palms of the gloves and written, ""Thank you."" He didn't know where the gloves came from or who had written those words. The hospitality tents had equipment and supplies donated by people from all over America. The gloves could have been from a firefighter in California or a school kid in Indiana or a housewife in Iowa, Brink thought. But the ""Thank you"" helped him get through trying days. Over the years, some objects became symbols of 9/11. One was the fire truck that belonged to the New York Fire Department's Ladder Company 3. On September 11, Capt. Paddy Brown and Lt. Kevin Donnelly had rushed with their crew from Manhattan's East Village to the North Tower minutes after Flight 11 struck. The firefighters made their way up the skyscraper to find and evacuate victims. Some people later said the sight of the firefighters gave them a sense of calm in the midst of terror. A short while later, 11 members of Ladder 3 were dead as the North Tower crumpled. James Wind, a member of Ladder 3, was off that day. But he made his way to ground zero to help. When he arrived on the scene, he saw his company's truck. The ladder was bent down to the bumper. The front of the truck was on fire but it was still running and the lights were on. ""That truck was battered around like a ping-pong ball,"" Wind said. ""It was a beast, but there was a bigger beast that took it."" An officer always carries a list of his men and leaves a copy in the truck. Wind reached in and looked at the second list. He hoped beyond hope but knew: He was probably looking at names of the dead. They were his friends, his brothers. He knew their wives, their lives. He'd seen them almost every day for years. He wants visitors to see the mangled truck at the museum. ""Live your life,"" he said, ""but be aware. This can happen still."" Construction worker Frank Silecchia felt damaged from days of recovery efforts. He'd already worn through several pairs of boots -- the steel was so hot at the site that it melted the soles. He'd volunteered to help with the hope of finding a survivor. He found none. On Day 3, he helped carry out three bodies from 6 World Trade Center and paused to look out at the destruction. A 17-foot-long crossbeam weighing at least two tons had landed at a perfect vertical angle. Silecchia saw a cross. He dropped to his knees in tears. He believed it was a sign from God. He found renewed strength to carry on. ""Evil destroyed that building,"" Silecchia said, ""and faith rose out if it."" A few days later, he showed his discovery to a Franciscan priest named Father Jordan, who pushed to get the World Trade Center cross lifted out of the wreckage and preserved near the site. Silecchia believes the museum will be like walking through a horror show for some visitors. He hopes that seeing the cross there will bring comfort, just as it did for him 13 years ago. Ramirez, the museum's curator, said regardless of religious belief, people found inspiration in the cross and that is why it was included in the museum. She hopes the ordinary objects in the exhibit stand as testament to courage, kindness and human resiliency. Ramirez considers herself and her colleagues at the September 11 museum third responders. They are the people who set evidence aside; the people whose job it was to give meaning to ordinary objects. ""It's a collective story about how people can be good to one another in times of crisis,"" she said.

"I can't imagine growing up in the '50s, certainly not as myself or any degree of myself that I am now. My strongest sense of the '50s comes from Betty Friedan and feminist critiques of the era. And June Cleaver. But the 1950s TV stereotypes of women as housewives in fancy dresses and high heels gave way to a much more interesting cast of characters when the '60s came along. In real life, there probably never was a family as picture perfect and problem free as the '50s Cleavers,  but June Cleaver was certainly the archetype of her decade.  As a child, I didn't quite know what I wanted to be when I grew up, but I knew who I didn't want to be.  I didn't want to be June Cleaver.  The dress. The hair. The pearls.  The sense that she never had any fun, never broke the rules, possibly never even exhaled.  Her entire existence circumscribed by her white picket fence. I couldn't imagine being Donna Reed.  Or the mom from ""Father Knows Best.""  Or Harriet Nelson.  None of them. But then along came Gidget. I still hadn't been born when the TV show ""Gidget"" premiered in the 1960s.  In fact, my parents had just barely met.  But years later, as a kid in the early 1980s, I would watch reruns of ""Gidget.""  Finally, a TV woman I wanted to be.  Smart.  Independent.  Even sarcastic at times.  She went to school.  She hung out outside the house.  She even surfed.  She was everything! Video: Name that 60s TV show . As a little girl, I didn't realize all that had happened in the years between June Cleaver and Gidget Lawrence, everything that had changed in society to create a new era of culture that mirrored a new day in America, one in which the compulsion to be June Cleaver was eroded as a universe of Gidgets arose. Suddenly, women like Marlo Thomas (from ""That Girl""), independent with careers, were on the scene.  There was Agent 99 from ""Get Smart"" and Emma Peel from ""The Avengers"" --- not just career women, but spies.  Who kicked ass!  There was Samantha in ""Bewitched,"" who had immense powers --- just like Jeannie, about whom I indeed dreamed. And most ground-breaking of all, there was ""Julia,"" which featured a leading African American character who was a single mother. Nick at Night introduced me to the 1960s Technicolor menu of gender roles and role models unheralded in the narrow black-and-white confines of the 1950s.  I could watch TV and see women with personalities and problems and potential.  I was hooked. Of course, in hindsight, none of these shows was perfect.  Elizabeth Montgomery's character Samantha in ""Bewitched"" was always apologizing for using her magic.  Barbara Eden's character in ""I Dream Of Jeannie"" called the man whose house she lived in ""master.""  And Gidget was always being scolded by her overly stern and moralizing father, who like many male characters in shows of that era, seemed designed as stand-ins for older men of the 1950s generation who were deeply wary of, if not downright resistant to, the equality of women. At the end of each episode of ""Gidget,"" Sally Field would usually turn to the camera and announce the life lesson she'd learned, usually imparted by her father.  So in a way, metaphorically, she was still bowing to and echoing unquestioned male authority and hegemony.  But it was always Gidget who got the last word, who was the only one who could turn to us and speak to us directly.  She was given that special, powerful voice. And in the next episode, Gidget invariably broke the rules again.  In the socially and politically tumultuous era of the 1960s, the message of ""Gidget"" and ""Bewitched"" and ""I Dream Of Jeannie"" and all these shows where the women kept getting in trouble was not that the rules were enforced by these throwback men, but that the women kept breaking them. Show after show after show, the women kept breaking the rules, testing the limits, crossing the line.  That was the entire premise, the whole point. In the new era, there were strong and sassy women who would make their own rules.  And we would watch them and fall in love with them and want to be them and find the rules to break in our own lives and in the world around us.  For women and people of color and gay folks and anyone remotely not Ward Cleaver, the rules of the 1950s were at the very least limiting and in many cases ugly and violent.  These were rules that needed to be broken.  Gidget showed us how. ""Gidget"" the TV show only lasted for one season, a tragedy from which my little 8-year-old rerun watching self would never fully recover from all those years later.  And yet the social, cultural and political changes that 1960s TV women like Gidget helped both reflect and set in motion --- fortunately, those changes lasted for generations.

"Police in Thailand say an American tried to ship infant body parts to the United States, but the delivery was stopped after a call from the shipping company. The bizarre discovery is not the first time infant remains have been found in Thailand. In 2010, more than 2,000 illegally aborted fetuses were recovered at a Buddhist temple in Bangkok. Thai police say they received a phone call from a DHL shipping office in Pathum Thani province, on the outskirts of Bangkok, on Saturday. Police say workers there discovered the body parts inside parcel boxes as they were scanning shipments for delivery. The boxes contained an infant skull, internal organs and a few pieces of human skin, police say. Police dispatched a forensics team to retrieve the three boxes, which contained the human parts sealed in plastic bags and preserved in formaldehyde. Police Col. Adisorn Semsawat, chief of Bang Pongpang police station, said, ""We have talked with an American who was trying to send the parcels to the USA, but we could not press any charges on him and we are not quite sure which laws we can apply to him."" Police went on to say that the unidentified American told them that he found the infant body parts at a night flea market and that he had paid about $100 for them, though he could not remember where the market is located. Police say they are trying to find the seller. Thai police say they've been in touch with the U. S. Embassy and that the tourist's name has not been revealed because he hasn't committed any crimes or been formally charged. Infant body parts can be bought on the Thai black market. Some Thais practice black magic and believe that supernatural power comes from infant body parts, if the rites are performed by monks or sorcerers. They believe that having the items provide protection and business success and can ward off bad luck. Police say in 2010, the smell of decay led investigators to the Phai-nguern Chotinaram temple in central Bangkok, where they discovered more than 2,000 illegally aborted fetuses. Three people were arrested, including two morticians who were charged with hiding bodies.","DHL shipping office in Bangkok called police when body parts found in boxes to be sent to U.S.

"(CNN)At the edge of the Syrian war, photographer Furkan Temir found despair packed in tent camps and an outpouring of humanity from a tight-knit Turkish border community. ""There were too many people. Every day new tent areas sprung up and even that was not enough. People slept in mosques, abandoned homes, schools, any building they can find, and if they couldn't find anything, they slept in the street,"" Temir recalls. The more than three-year Syrian civil war gave ethnic Kurds an opportunity to break away from the central government and operate in semi-autonomous enclaves in the country's north, but it also meant that when the radical group ISIS threatened to overrun the strategic town of Kobani, the minority stood on its own. The fury and spectacle of the battle on the Turkish border drew the attention of the world and brought Temir with a sleeping bag, a Canon 6D camera and some spare change to nearby refugee camps, where he immersed himself for 17 days. ""I could not just come during the day and sleep in a hotel at night because I wanted to feel what they feel and truly understand the situation,"" Temir says, ""I found myself sleeping, eating, sharing cigarettes and daily life with the refugees. When other photographers would come they would hide their faces because they knew the difference. They felt I was more sincere and trusted me."" In just four days, 200,000 people from Kobani and the surrounding areas fled the horror of a terror group infamous for mass execution, beheadings and crucifixion. The exodus brought mothers cradling babies sucking on pacifiers and fathers bowing under the weight of belongings wrapped in bed sheets to Turkey's already strained border. The international media, generally barred from access by the restrictions of President Bashar al Assad's government, captured every frame. Television crews perched on Kurdish hilltops broadcast live skirmishes between Kurdish forces and masked ISIS militants just a few hundred kilometers away from the border. ""I used my camera as an instrument to hold my distance from the reality of what was happening, so I wouldn't feel 100% in the situation,"" Temir says. ""There was constant distraction and demolishment. Even the best things that happened destroyed homes and people."" The ""best things"" were U.S.-led coalition airstrikes that successfully reversed ISIS' advance on the town and deterred the expansion of the group's so-called Islamic caliphate, which stretches from north-central Syria to Iraq's Falluja. As Turkey's Kurdish community buried more of its soldiers and struggled to feed thousands of homeless families, the smoke and flash of American warplanes bombing jihadis proved an outlet for the ethnic group's seething anger. ""When you are really close to the war but you are still somewhat safe in your own country, and you see bombs dropping down and people dying and other people applauding this, you can tell this is war tourism.""

"(CNN) -- Even if U.S. and Iranian negotiators manage to meet the November 24 deadline for a nuclear agreement with Iran, America faces a very inconvenient reality in the Middle East: We're stuck in a kind of Middle East Bermuda Triangle where messy outcomes are more likely than neat solutions, and where ambiguity and uncertainty will rule over clarity and stability for years to come. And we better get used to it. Part of the problem, of course, is us. We sit thousands of miles away, in a protected cocoon with nonpredatory neighbors to our north and south and fish to our east and west -- what one historian brilliantly called our liquid assets. And while this physical detachment is a wondrous advantage, it has also given us a very skewed view of the world. We may have freed ourselves from the dark forces of history and geography. But the rest of the world hasn't. Just ask the Russians, Chinese, Iranians, Egyptians, Israelis or many others. For a start, our skewed view contributes to our naivete because we no longer really understand the mentality of the small power who lives in the bad neighborhood on the knife's edge. It also explains our arrogance, because we really don't have to listen. Our margin for error is very wide given our size, power and protected status, which helps explain our idealism and why we somehow believe we can and should find those solutions. Finally, our location informs our pragmatism, and the sense that somehow we can develop answers to these problems based on our own Hollywood, happy ending and heroic view of the world. I'm sure you remember ""Mission Accomplished"" under the last president -- and the campaign he launched to turn Iraq and Afghanistan into functioning democracies. Yet 11 years later, and we're now heading into Iraq War III. Even our current president believed that the Arab Spring required the United States to get on the right side of history by acquiescing in former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's downfall. But Egypt today is arguably less free and prosperous than under Mubarak. And let's not forget President Barack Obama's words about ""ultimately defeating ISIS."" Let's get real. Even though we killed Osama bin Laden and dismantled al Qaeda's central core, the gravest threat to our security right now isn't ISIS at all but an affiliate of an al Qaeda we were supposedly to have destroyed, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). These groups emerge from the poisonous environment that is now the Middle East. In order to defeat them permanently, we'd have to fix the entire region. We can't do that. And now we come to the inconvenient truth. The Middle East is a broken, angry, dysfunctional region (just make it BAD for short.) With the exception of Tunisia and perhaps Kurdistan -- both still works in progress -- and several of the Arab kings, the Arab world is melting down. It is now, and will be for a good deal longer, marked by civil war. It is dysfunctional, and it is made up of largely failed or failing states that lack good governance, respect for rule of law, gender equality, transparency, accountability and respect for freedom of conscience. Some argue that more time is required -- they urge us not to judge prematurely. Fair enough. But even the longer term trend lines don't look good. Where are the leaders who are capable and willing to rise above their narrow partisan, sectarian affiliations to govern in the interests of a nation as whole? Where are the institutions that reflect the popular will, inclusiveness and legitimacy of the public? And where is the good governance that seeks to deliver freedom, security and economic prosperity? Ultimately, where are the moderates within the Arab Muslim world who will denounce, fight and marginalize the extremists who have corrupted their religion? The politically incorrect read on all of this is that this part of the world just isn't ready for prime time. Indeed, there is not a single issue that appears on the verge of a sustainable solution. And there won't be for some time to come. Israeli-Palestinian peace? To do that, you need leaders, real ownership and decisions to close the yawning gaps on the big issues. But right now, there aren't any of those things in sufficient quantities. What about Iraq? That remains a country whose future is extremely uncertain as corruption, sectarianism, and regionalism threaten to pull it apart. Syria? Right now it is a veritable black hole with at least four subconflicts: ISIS vs. America; Bashar al-Assad vs. the so-called moderate Sunni opposition; jihadis vs. jihadis; and sooner rather than later, perhaps, America vs. al-Assad. What kind of Syria all of these tensions will produce is simply unknowable. Suffice it to say, a unified, democratic state where everyone lives in peace and harmony will likely not be one of them. The fact is that more progress has been made on the U.S.-Iranian nuclear issue than all of these other issues. And yet even here should a deal be reached, the politics, lack of trust, conflicts on so many other regional issues, and challenges of implementation will all but guarantee perennial problems between the US and Iran. America will have its hands full in this region for years to come. And it may well be able to help shape outcomes to some of these problems that will further its own interests. But it must give up any illusion that it can somehow produce solutions. These are, by and large, Middle Eastern problems, and their solutions will need to be owned by those who live in the neighborhood. Michael Jackson opined in his classic song ""Man in the Mirror"" that if you want to make a real change, than start by looking in the mirror. If the region wants to fix itself with America's help, that's the place to start.","Geography has left U.S. with very skewed view of the world, Aaron Miller says .

U.S. officials aren't saying. But the State Department is now stepping up security of its unclassified network during a system shutdown, the senior State Department official said. The activity was spotted in portions of an unclassified e-mail system, the official said, and there was ""no compromise of any of the Department's classified systems.""

"Nigerian troops backed by civilian vigilantes reclaimed the northeastern town of Chibok late Saturday, a military spokesman and a community leader said Sunday. The town had been seized by Boko Haram militants on Thursday. Chibok is the scene of the April 14 abduction of over 200 schoolgirls by Boko Haram, which sparked global outrage. ""Our troops have recaptured Chibok from Boko Haram terrorists who invaded it on Thursday,"" said Col. Sani Usman, military spokesman for Borno state. ""The town was retaken late Saturday by troops working alongside civilian vigilantes after crushing the terrorists. ""Troops are still conducting mop-up operation in nearby villages to flush out remnants of the terrorists,"" Usman said. Scores of Boko Haram militants drove into the town around 4:00 p.m. Thursday and engaged soldiers protecting the town and local vigilantes in a fierce gunfight, forcing re‎sidents to flee. The militants blew up‎ all telecommunications towers in the town ‎with rocket-propelled grenades, making the town unreachable by telephone. Pogu Bitrus, head of the Chibok Elders Forum, confirmed the takeover of the town from Boko Haram but gave credit to the vigilantes for the victory. ""I can confirm that Chibok has been reclaimed from Boko Haram by our vigilantes with the assistance of soldiers,"" Bitrus said. ""I spoke with the leader of the vigilantes via satellite phone and he confirmed the good news to me,"" said Bitrus, who lives in Nigeria's capital, Abuja. ""The vigilantes entered Chibok and fought Boko Haram from inside while soldiers laid siege outside the town and take down any fleeing militants,"" he said. Chibok was strewn with weapons, vehicles and other personal effects abandoned by the defeated insurgents, Bitrus said. Civilian vigilantes have in recent days taken center stage in the fight against Boko Haram Islamists, who have seized over two dozen towns and villages in northeastern Nigeria in the past two months. Bitrus said soldiers fled when Boko Haram attacked Chibok, leaving the vigilantes to fight. The vigilantes had to withdraw when they ran out of ammunition for their shotguns. On Thursday over 200 vigilantes and local hunters clawed back the town of Mubi, the commercial hub of Adamawa st‎ate, which was seized by Boko Haram two weeks ago. The vigilantes on Wednesday reportedly took back the town of Maiha after a prolonged gun battle ‎in which scores of the insurgents were killed. The fleeing Islamists regrouped and took over the towns of Hong and Gombi as well as Chibok. Hong and Gombi are still under Boko Haram control, according to residents.","Nigerian troops backed by civilian vigilantes reclaim the town of Chibok .

"The NFL, already under fire for its handling of concussions and domestic violence, saw several teams visited by the Drug Enforcement Administration after their Sunday games. It follows yet another allegation that the nation's most popular sports league has less than the highest regard for its players' well-being, as team trainers are being accused of handing out prescription painkillers to keep players on the field. DEA agents interviewed doctors and trainers of several NFL teams after their games as part of an investigation into allegations of illegal dispensing of prescription drugs. The DEA questioned the medical and training staffs of the San Francisco 49ers following the team's 16-10 victory at the New York Giants, agency spokesman Rusty Payne told CNN. The 49ers cooperated with the ""random inspection"" at MetLife Stadium, the team's director of communications, Bob Lange, said. The team departed the stadium as scheduled, he added. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers announced via Twitter that the DEA  ""checked in"" with the team at the Baltimore-Washington International Airport. After a five-minute delay, the team proceeded to its plane without incident, the team said. A Justice Department official told CNN that DEA agents interviewed team doctors at ""several locations."" The DEA investigation stems from allegations in a lawsuit filed by 1,300 former NFL players that the league illegally provided powerful painkillers and other prescription drugs to keep them on the field. The class-action lawsuit was filed in California in May. Other allegations include that drugs were being administered by staff -- specifically athletic trainers -- lacking the licenses to do so. If true, these actions would violate the Controlled Substances Act. Sunday's questioning of doctors and trainers was administrative and not criminal, Payne said. No arrests were made, he said. ""Our teams cooperated with the DEA today, and we have no information to indicate that irregularities were found,"" said Brian McCarthy, the NFL's vice president of corporate communications. The players' suit accuses NFL trainers of handing out pills without prescriptions and without regard to possible dangerous interactions with other drugs. The named players in the lawsuit include former Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon who, according to the lawsuit, says he got hooked on painkillers by taking as many as 100 Percocet pills a month.","The DEA interviewed doctors and trainers for the San Francisco 49ers .

"Republican lawmakers overwhelmingly agreed on Sunday talk shows that shutting down the government to avoid unilateral action by President Barack Obama on immigration is not a good option . ""I think there's got to be more productive ways for us to be able to impress on the President the need to work for a permanent solution as opposed to a temporary stop-gap solution,"" Mitt Romney, former Massachusetts governor and two-time presidential candidate, said on the CBS show ""Face the Nation."" ""The President ought to let the Republican Congress, the Republican House and the Republican Senate, come together with legislation that they put on his desk which relates to immigration. And he can veto it or not, but let the Congress and let this election have its say, as opposed to jumping in by doing something unilaterally -- and in a way which is extraconstitutional -- he's poking an eye of the Republican leaders in Congress, and he's making it more difficult for there to be a permanent solution to this issue."" Another potential 2016 presidential contender for the GOP also weighed in. ""No, we shouldn't shut down the government,"" Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said on ""Fox News Sunday.""  ""But absolutely they should do everything they can to force the President to follow the law."" In September, the White House announced that it would delay any action on immigration until after the November elections. Shortly after the midterms, the President left Washington for a weeklong trip to Asia and Australia.  Obama is scheduled to return to Washington on Sunday night, and the issue is expected to be at the top of his agenda. Sens.-elect James Lankford of Oklahoma and Tom Cotton of Arkansas both received calls from the President on Election Night, urging compromise on the issue. On Sunday, both resolved not to go down the same path as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who voted to shut down the government in October 2013, less than a year into his first term. ""We're not pursuing a government shutdown,"" Lankford said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""I don't think anyone wants to shut down government because that doesn't solve the problem,"" Cotton echoed. A few of their Republican colleagues mirrored their sentiments, with Sen. John Thune of South Dakota saying a shutdown ""doesn't solve the problem"" and Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma saying a shutdown is an ""inappropriate weapon (and an) inappropriate tool."" But in rejecting the government shutdown option, Republicans are now faced with a key question: Where must they compromise to pass a bill that the President will actually sign? Speaking at the G20 Summit in Australia on Sunday morning, Obama outlined his conditions. ""There is a very simple solution to this perception that somehow I'm exercising too much executive authority. Pass a bill I can sign on this issue,"" Obama said. ""If Congress passes a law that solves our border problems, improves our legal immigration system, and provides a pathway for the 11 million people who are here, working in our kitchens, working in farms, making beds in hotels, everybody knows they're there, we're not going to deport all of them. We'd like to see them being able to be out in the open, pay their taxes, pay a penalty, get right with the law."" Despite vocalizing his aggressive plans for unilateral action on immigration, Obama did concede that any executive action he takes could be undone by his successor. ""The very nature of executive authority means future presidents can reverse those actions,"" Obama said. In June 2013, the Senate passed a bipartisan immigration bill that outlined provisions to create a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented residents, while also beefing up security along the border. More than 500 days later, the House has yet to pass a bill of its own, a situation that House Speaker John Boehner insists exists because of the President's unwillingness to compromise. ""We're going to fight the President tooth and nail if he continues down this path,"" Boehner said at a news conference Friday. ""This is the wrong way to govern."" Defiant Obama says he won't bend to GOP .","President Obama is expected to take executive action if Congress doesn't act .

"The latest norovirus outbreak aboard the Princess Cruises' Crown Princess has infected 172 people, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At least 158 of 3,009 passengers and 14 of 1,160 crew members came down with the virus aboard the Crown Princess during a 28-day cruise that docked in Los Angeles on Sunday. This ship had sailed from Los Angeles to Hawaii and Tahiti. Are cruise ships floating petri dishes? Onboard rapid norovirus testing resulted in positive results of the virus, the CDC investigation update confirmed. ""Over the last few days, the ship began seeing an increased number of gastrointestinal illnesses, caused by norovirus (commonly referred to as the stomach flu),"" said Princess Cruises spokeswoman Susan Lomax, via email. ""In response, we have enacted our stringent disinfecting protocols developed in conjunction with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which includes an extensive deep cleaning of the ship and the terminal in Los Angeles on Sunday before the ship embarks on its next voyage."" The CDC statement confirmed the ship has implemented CDC sanitation procedures to slow the disease's spread. The cruise line also made announcements to notify onboard passengers of the outbreak, encouraging hand hygiene and case reporting. Passengers about to board the ship were also supposed to be notified. At least 122 of 3,161 passengers and 30 of 1,176 crew members aboard the Crown Princess were sickened on an April sailing, according to the CDC. The federal agency blamed norovirus and E. Coli for the outbreak. Norovirus is known for being quite contagious. It causes nausea, vomiting and diarrhea and is believed to have infected passengers on a number of cruise ships this year.

"Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has asked his staff for detailed information about the U.S. military's relationships with the National Football League in the wake of the scandal over how the league is handling domestic-abuse allegations against players, CNN has learned. News of the Pentagon review comes on the same day a senior Obama administration official decried recent domestic abuse episodes within the NFL and said the league needs to ""get a handle on"" the situation since so many professional athletes are considered role models to younger players. The Pentagon is increasingly sensitive to any suggestion it is supporting a major sports organization that is perceived to tolerate domestic violence. ""The secretary wants to fully understand that relationship, in case he decides to make some changes to it,"" a senior defense official told CNN. The military has a zero-tolerance policy in the ranks for domestic abuse, but it also has a high-profile relationship with the NFL that goes back decades. Any Pentagon action to cut back support for the NFL would be the most direct involvement by the Obama administration yet in the scandal. Millions at stake . The Army alone spends some $10 million a year buying advertising from television networks broadcasting NFL games. Games are also broadcast by the Armed Forces Network to troops deployed overseas. Military support for the NFL games includes: providing ceremonial units at games for colors ceremonies; military personnel singing the national anthem, and other units providing drill teams or flyovers. Military personnel, including wounded warriors, often appear at NFL events honoring those who serve. The Army and the NFL also have a agreement to share information and resources to better understand traumatic brain injury, which is a major medical issue both for wounded troops and football players. They are working together on awareness of TBI as well as research into treatment. The military has been sharing some of the lessons learned on TBI from the last 13 years of war, specifically. Another program, NFL Play 60, has seen players visit military bases to encourage children to be more active as least 60 minutes a day to help prevent childhood obesity. It is clear the White House is also closely monitoring the NFL controversy, with one senior administration official calling recent abuse allegations ""deeply troubling"" and stressing the league's obligation to ""(get) control of the situation."" ""Many of these professional athletes are marketed as role models to young people,"" the official said. ""So their behavior does have the potential to influence these young people. So that's one of the many reasons it's important the league gets a handle on this and have zero tolerance."" Four NFL players made headlines this week over allegations of abuse: . -- Jonathan Dwyer, 25, a running back for the Arizona Cardinals, was released on bond Thursday after his arrest on charges he assaulted his wife and their toddler son. -- Adrian Peterson of the Minnesota Vikings and Greg Hardy of the Carolina Panthers took paid leave this week from their teams to focus on their legal cases. Peterson, a running back and one of the league's premier players, has been charged in Texas with child abuse on allegations he injured his 4-year-old son this summer. Peterson's attorney said the ""charged conduct involves using a switch to spank his son."" Hardy, a star defensive end, has been convicted of misdemeanor assault charges in North Carolina and has been granted the opportunity to have a new trial, this time in front of a jury. -- The NFL Players Association on Tuesday filed an appeal on behalf of former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice, whom the NFL suspended indefinitely after a security video emerged that shows him knocking his then-fiancÃ©e unconscious in a hotel elevator in February.","Defense secretary has asked staff for info about military's relationships with the NFL .

"The Dutch version of festive St. Nicholas is once again landing on the naughty list for some in the Netherlands, who say his Black Pete sidekick is a racist throwback to the colonial era. Protesters gathered Sunday at Amsterdam's festival honoring St. Nicholas -- or Sinterklaas as he is known in Dutch -- a day after 90 people were arrested in demonstrations surrounding his ceremonial arrival in country at the Dutch city of Gouda. They carried signs reading, ""Black Pete is racism."" Only one person was arrested in Sunday's event, according to CNN affiliate RTL and Dutch national broadcaster NOS. In the Netherlands, Sinterklaas is accompanied by a dark-skinned figure, often played by whites in black face who wear curly afro-style wigs and red lip coloring. The character sometimes visits private home and hands out candy to children but also is reputed to take away the naughty ones. The tradition has grown increasingly contentious in recent years, with the United Nations arguing last year in favor of a national dialogue on the practice. Experts working under the auspices of the Office of the High Commissioner for Humam Rights last year said people of African descent found the character's depiction ""rooted in unacceptable, colonial attitudes that they find racist and offensive."" The Dutch government replied that it was aware that the practice was offensive to some, and that it had received dozens of complaints a year concerning Black Pete since 2011. Last week, a high-level Dutch court declined to rule on the controversy.","Dutch ""Black Pete"" tradition draws fire again with protests and arrests .

"World leaders at the G20 summit have agreed to a series of measures aimed at boosting the global economy by more than $2 trillion. The plans, if they're fully put into action, would lift the combined gross domestic product of G20 nations by an extra 2.1% by 2018, a communique from the summit said on Sunday. ""We can do more for our people and the wider world when we work together,"" Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who hosted the summit, told journalists. The G20 is a group of the biggest advanced and emerging economies on the planet, accounting for two-thirds of the world's population, 85% of global gross domestic product. 'Millions of jobs' The action plan from the summit, held this weekend in the city of Brisbane, contains more than 800 separate reform measures, Abbott said. The strategies include ""major investment initiatives, including actions to strengthen public investment and improve our domestic investment and financing climate,"" according to the communique. But international leaders agreeing to do something is one thing, actually putting it into action is another. ""We will do everything we humanly can to make them happen,"" Abbott said of the measures, which are specific to each member country. The International Monetary Fund and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ""will be regularly reviewing our progress to achieving these measures to keep us accountable,"" he said. If all of it is successfully put into practice, the overall package will ""add more than $2 trillion to the global economy and create millions of jobs,"" the communique said. Climate change commitment . The statement also voiced support for ""strong and effective action to address climate change."" G20 members said they agreed to work to successfully adopt a measure ""with legal force"" under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The deadline is a major conference in Paris next year. That commitment follows the historic climate change deal announced last week by the United States and China, the world's two largest emitters of greenhouse gases. ""There was a lot of pressure here in Brisbane that the G20 follow through, continue the momentum about climate change,"" said CNN's Andrew Stevens. Under the U.S.-China agreement, the United States would cut its 2005 level of carbon emissions by 26-28% before the year 2025. China would peak its carbon emissions by 2030 and will also aim to get 20% of its energy from zero-carbon emission sources by the same year. Obama: Success . President Obama who spoke to journalists after Abbott, commended the summit for its work but also took the opportunity to wrap up his entire trip to Asia with a few words of self-praise. ""From trade to climate change to the fight against Ebola, this was a strong week for American leadership, the result will be more jobs for the American people, historic steps towards a cleaner and healthier planet, and progress towards saving lives not just in West Africa but eventually in other places,"" he said. ""If you ask me I'd say that's a pretty good week."" The trip contrasts with the political reality Obama faces in Washington, after his party suffered heavily in the midterm elections this month. Obama said of his Asian trip that he planned to ""build on that momentum"" after his return to Washington.","G20: The planned measures would lift the combined GDP of G20 nations by 2.1% .

"An Israeli was stabbed Sunday near central Jerusalem, police said, the latest in a string of similar attacks. The 32-year-old was stabbed with a screwdriver, police said. Authorities are searching for the attacker, described as an Arab youth who fled in the direction of Damascus Gate, an entrance to Jerusalem's Old City. The victim was taken to a hospital in moderate condition, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. Last week, a 20-year-old was stabbed and killed in Tel Aviv, and three people were stabbed -- one fatally -- near the entrance to a settlement in the West Bank.  The latter incident took place at the same hitchhiking spot where three Israeli teens were kidnapped earlier this year; they were later killed. One alleged attacker was caught; the other was shot by a security guard, police said. Israel has also recently been facing what some call an ""auto intifada"" -- a spate of attacks on Jewish civilians in Jerusalem by Palestinians driving vehicles. The violence has stirred fears of another intifada, or armed uprising -- though analysts say there's no sign yet that one is on the way. Meanwhile, an Israeli border policeman has been detained in Israel in connection with the May shooting death of a Palestinian teen. Palestinians are facing a fresh internal rift between the two major political factions: Fatah, which controls the West Bank, and Hamas, which controls Gaza.  Fatah recently accused Hamas of bombing Fatah leaders' homes.","A 32-year-old Israeli was stabbed with a screwdriver, police say .

"(CNN) -- He was the man behind KITT the talking car, Magnum and Starbuck. Prolific television producer Glen A. Larson passed away on Friday at the age of 77 after a battle with cancer, his son James told CNN. Larson produced many popular and cult favorite shows in the late 1970s and 1980s, including ""Magnum, P.I.,"" ""Knight Rider"" (with its talking car), ""Battlestar Galactica"" (with its space-age hero Starbuck), ""The Fall Guy,"" ""Quincy, M.E."" and ""Buck Rogers in the 25th Century."" His entertainment career started in the 1950s, when he was a member of the all-male quartet the Four Preps. He started in television in the 1960s, working on ""The Fugitive,"" ""Alias Smith and Jones"" and ""The Six Million Dollar Man."" Larson loved action and science fiction, and ""Battlestar Galactica"" was a concept he considered for about 10 years before it finally hit the air in 1978. While it only lasted one season, its 2003 reboot was a critical and commercial success. His ""Buck Rogers in the 25th Century"" reportedly re-used special effects and sets from ""Battlestar."" Larson was also responsible for one of the best-known short-lived series, ""Manimal,"" which was heavily promoted by NBC in 1983 but only lasted eight episodes. Larson was cited on Twitter as a major influence upon many Hollywood writers and producers. Among them was Ronald D. Moore, who rebooted ""Battlestar"": ""Goodbye Glen Larson and thank you for creating one of the shows from my childhood that changed my life. May you find your own 13th Colony."" Actor Edward James Olmos, who played Commander Adama in the new series, also paid his respects: ""Glen Larson, we thank you for the ride, you are battlestar, we will miss you. See you on the other side."" ""Knight Rider"" star David Hasselhoff shared his condolences to Larson's family as well: ""(He) had 7 tv series at one time! Without him there'd be no KITT & Michael."" Scott Baio called him a ""dear friend,"" while ""Walking Dead"" executive producer Scott Gimple tweeted that Larson will ""rule forever."" People we've lost in 2014 .","Prolific TV producer Glen A.
