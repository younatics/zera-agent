"Daisy-Ray Anderson drowned in the bath when her father popped downstairs to get towels and her mother was out visiting a neighbour . A nine month-old girl drowned in the bath after her father went downstairs to get towels and nappies and her mother popped out to visit a neighbour, an inquest heard. Daisy-Ray Anderson was found face-down in the water by her father Dale, who left her briefly to fetch the supplies. The baby was in the bath with her 18-month-old sister Lilly - just metres away from where 12 cannabis plants were growing, a coroner was told. Daisy-Ray was put in the bath with her sister by their mother Emma Oliver, who left the bathroom after Mr Anderson entered the room to take over. When the children were ready to get out, he called to Miss Oliver to bring up the nappies and towels, but she did not answer so he went to grab them himself. Mr Anderson, a market trader, told the coroner: 'I came back up and that's when I saw Daisy. She was face-down in the water. 'I pulled her out and starting doing CPR on the floor. I was screaming and shouting for help. 'I got water and vomit out of her mouth but she wasn't breathing.' Mr Anderson told the inquest that Daisy-Ray was in a baby bath towards the top of the main bath near to the taps, while her sister Lilly was in the main bath. Recalling the tragic day in September 2012, he said he went downstairs to find the front door of their home, in Moston, Greater Manchester, open. 'Emma wasn't there', he said. 'I slammed the door shut and got what I needed and went back upstairs. 'I didn't know Emma was going to leave the house. Then I heard the door go so I ran downstairs and opened the door. 'She looked at me and I was as white as a ghost. She just ran upstairs and picked Daisy up. She started screaming and panicking.' Parents Emma Oliver and Dale Anderson were cleared of child cruelty charges after Daisy-Ray drowned in the bath in 2012 . Mr Anderson went downstairs to fetch towels and nappies after Miss Oliver went out to visit a neighbour . The inquest heard that paramedics took Daisy-Ray to North Manchester General Hospital where she was later pronounced dead. Miss Oliver, a trainee plasterer, told the coroner she had put Daisy in the bath at around 10am because she had been sick. Daisry-Ray (pictured) was in the bath with her 18-month-old sister Lilly when she drowned . She said: 'Lilly came up and said she wanted a bath too so I filled it up for her. 'I wasn't the one who played with the kids in the bath. I washed Daisy first and then got out the toys and then Dale came in. 'I nipped out for five minutes and went to see my neighbour. Lilly was 18 months old and we were talking about getting her name on the list for school. 'I didn't tell Dale I was going out and it was usual for him to play with the kids in the bath. 'I went over to my neighbour's still in my pyjamas so I went home to get dressed. I came back home and realised my door was shut. 'Dale came down and he was as white as a sheet. I just ran upstairs.' Consultant paediatric pathologist Gauri Batra told Manchester Coroners' Court that a post-mortem on Daisy-Ray confirmed her cause of death was drowning. She said: 'This was a clean, well-nourished little girl and there was nothing congenitally wrong with her.' The couple, who are engaged, were charged with child cruelty after the tragic death but were later cleared by a jury. Paramedics took Daisy-Ray to hospital where she was pronounced dead after her father found her face-down in the water . They both admitted cannabis growing offences and Mr Anderson received a community order while she was conditionally discharged. Jean Harkin, assistant coroner for Manchester City, recorded a verdict of accidental death. She said: 'It's very clear that it's very dangerous to leave children for just one minute but no parent would have expected this to happen. 'All I can say to you is that you have to hold on to the memories that you have from when Daisy was alive.'","Daisy-Ray Anderson drowned in the bath when her father went downstairs .

"President Barack Obama said Wednesday that illegal immigrants he said could stay in the country would not be deported, regardless of a judge's injunction on his executive actions, as a court battle between his administration and more than two dozen states continues. Following the Texas judge's decision to put a hold on the president's programs, the Department of Homeland Security said it would not begin implementation of the first wave of the president's programs. But Obama told supporters of his immigration measures on Wednesday evening that in the meantime, his administration would continue to move to the front of the line criminals and illegal immigrants not included in his programs. 'If you’ve been here for a long time and if you qualify, generally, then during this period, even with legal uncertainty, they should be in a good place,' Obama said during a town hall hosted by Telemundo and MSNBC. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama, at a town hall meeting on immigration hosted by Telemundo and MSNBC, on Wednesday confirmed that illegal immigrants he said could stay in the country would not be deported, regardless of a judge's injunction on his executive actions . Republican-appointed judge Andrew Hanen last week granted a request from a block of 26 states to temporarily put a hold on the president's executive actions. DHS said the following day that it would appeal the decision but, 'in the meantime, we recognize we must comply with it.' At the same time, it claimed the court order did not affect its 'ability to set and implement enforcement priorities.' 'Pursuant to those enforcement priorities, we continue to prioritize public safety, national security, and border security,' Homeland Security chief Jeh Johnson said. And while the judge's injunction applies to all new applicants to the president's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival program, it has no effect on previous participants who were accepted when it launched in 2012. The Obama administration is currently awaiting a response to its request for a stay from Hanen. The White House said Wednesday that it wouldn't ask a higher court to get involved until it had exhausted its options at the district court level. At the bilingual town hall, taped in Miami, Florida, on Wednesday afternoon and aired during primetime on the sponsoring networks, the president encouraged illegal immigrants who qualify for his programs to continue readying their paperwork because the law is on his administration's side. 'In the meantime, understand that [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and the border security mechanisms that we have in place, they are instructed to focus on criminals and people who have just crossed the border,' he said. And ICE Officials who don't abide by his directives are 'going to be answerable to the head of the Department of Homeland Security,' Obama said, 'because he’s been very clear about what our priorities should be. And I’ve been very clear about what our priorities should be.' Obama said both he and DHS head Johnson were 'absolutely committed' to the new deportation processes and they are working with state and local governments to make sure families are able to stay together. 'You are going to see I think a substantial change, even as the case works its way through the courts,' he said. It is unfortunate that Republican governors are suing his administration, Obama said, and that they were able to find a judge to enjoin the administration from moving forward with its plans. 'But that’s just the first part of the process. This is just one federal judge. We have appealed it very aggressively,' the president noted. 'We’re going to be as aggressive as we can,' he said, not only because his administration is legally in the right but because 'history is also on our side.' Obama was interviewed by MSNBC and Telemundo's Jose Diaz-Balart at Florida International University in Miami. The president said his administration is 'going to be as aggressive' as it can in fighting the court order . Pressed to explain why he didn't save all illegal immigrants from removal, Obama explained that such a move exceeded his constitutional authority. 'If, in fact, we were completely just rewriting the immigration laws, then actually the other side would have a case, because we can’t violate statutes,' Obama told Diaz-Balart. 'We can’t violate laws that are already in place. 'What we can do is make choices to implement those laws,' he said, which is what Obama claims his administration has done. Obama found himself on the defense again moments later Diaz-Balart relayed a question he said was commonly asked by viewers of both networks before the event: Why didn't the president and his party pass comprehensive immigration reform during his first several years in office when Democrats were a the helm of both the House and Senate. 'I don’t know if anybody remembers, José, that when I took office and I had a majority, we had the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression,' Obama responded, with a hint of snark in his tone. 'The global economy was collapsing. The unemployment rate in the Latino community and the immigrant community had soared. People were losing homes and entire communities were being devastated. So it wasn’t as if I was just sitting back, not doing anything.' Democrats did manage to push through healthcare reform during that time, however, as Diaz-Balart pointed out. 'We were moving very aggressively on a whole host of issues,' Obama told him. 'And we moved as fast as we could and we wanted immigration done. We pushed for immigration to be done. But, ultimately, we could not get the votes to get it all done.' That is 'one of the challenges of being President' Obama said -  'there are crying needs everywhere.' 'I don’t regret having done the ACA. I just described for you there are millions of people who are not going to go bankrupt because they got sick because we got that done,' he said frankly. 'So if the question is, would I have loved to have gotten everything done in the first two years, absolutely, because then, for the next six, I could have relaxed.' Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell, left, and Speaker of the House John Boehner, right, toast with mint juleps during an event earlier this month. Obama accused Republicans in Congress, who are led by the two men, during the town hall of 'trying to hold hostage' funding for the Department of Homeland Security and putting at risk the nation's security . The president also addressed the ongoing fight between Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill over his immigration measures. Senators agreed to move forward today with legislation funding the Department of Homeland Security but it has not yet passed the proposal. The House must also agree to it before it can be sent the president. Republicans had initially tied funding for Homeland Security to language undercutting Obama, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell backed off that plan with a deadline to fund DHS or see it partially shut down looming and no end to a Democratic filibuster in sight. He's now pursing a two-pronged strategy in which the Senate will first vote to approve the funding measure, and then vote to put a check on Obama's power. Conservatives in the House indicated today that they may not support the appropriations bill if Speaker John Boehner brings similar legislation to the floor of the lower chamber, pointing out that the bulk of the agencies housed in DHS would remain open even if a shutdown were to occur. Because they are deemed 'essential' to the functioning of the federal government, roughly 85 percent of the department's workers would be kept on the job. Obama accused Republicans during the town hall of 'trying to hold hostage' funding for DHS and putting at risk the nation's security. If GOP leaders in the House and Senate 'want to have a vote on whether what I’m doing is legal or not, they can have that vote,' he said. 'I will veto that vote, because I’m absolutely confident that what we’re doing is the right thing to do,' he said to rancorous applause. 'And in the meantime, we’re going to continue to pursue all legal avenues,' he said, 'to make sure that we have a country in which we are respecting not only the law, because we’re a nation of laws, but we’re also respecting the fact that we’re a nation of immigrants.'","'If you’ve been here for a long time and if you qualify, generally... even with legal uncertainty, they should be in a good place,' Obama said .

"A book that helped Henry VIII build his case against the pope for an annulment from Catherine of Aragon has been discovered in a library at a country home in Cornwall. The summary of works by philosopher and theologian William of Ockham - who was a major figure in medieval intellectual and political thought - shows how agents for the monarch scoured the country for texts in order to question the pope's authority. The book, dated 1495, was then used to argue for the king's independence as he sought to annual his first wife - his brother's widow - after she failed to produce a male heir. A book (pictured) that helped Henry VIII build his case against the pope for an annulment from his first wife Catherine of Aragon has been discovered in a library at a country home in Cornwall . The summary of works (left) by philosopher and theologian William of Ockham shows how agents for the monarch scoured the country for texts in order to question the authority of the pope (right) He went on to marry Anne Boleyn in an episode in British history which ultimately led to the break-up with Rome and has been documented in Hilary Mantel's novels, produced for TV as Wolf Hall. The book,  found at the National Trust's Lanhydrock in Cornwall, contains marginal notes and marks made by the king's secretarial staff to draw his attention to relevant passages. Highlighted passages include 'when a synod is greater than a pope' and 'when it is permitted to withdraw from obedience to the pope'. Staff had been aware of the book in the library, which holds 2,500 volumes, but its direct connection to the royal marriage was not known until a visit from a Tudor historian. Professor James Carley, a professor at York University, Toronto, identified inventory number 282 inside the book, which corresponds to the inventory prepared for the king's chief library at Westminster Palace in 1542. Professor Carley, an expert on the libraries of Henry VIII, said: 'It's thrilling to discover that the book at Lanhydrock is from the royal library. The book, found at the National Trust's Lanhydrock in Cornwall, contains marginal notes and marks made by the king's secretarial staff to draw his attention to relevant passages. Pictured: Manager Paul Holden . 'The book is important not only for its provenance but for the notes entered in it by Henry VIII's advisers and no doubt intended for him to see. 'They draw attention to precisely the sort of issues that were so relevant to the king's policies in the years leading up to the break with Rome.' The book is a summary of critical writings by William of Ockham, an English Franciscan friar and scholastic philosopher and theologian, who died in 1347. Ockham is considered one of the major critical figures of medieval thought, with writings that challenged Pope John XXII's condemnation of the Franciscan views on the poverty of Christ and his apostles. The book, dated 1495, was used to argue for the king's (left) independence as he sought to marry Anne Boleyn (right) The period of British history, which ultimately led to the break-up with Rome, has been documented in Hilary Mantel's novels, produced for TV as Wolf Hall (pictured) His book was among writings, manuscripts and printed books that were brought to the king's libraries and examined by staff to bolster his case for the dissolution of his marriage. Wavy lines, signs and short marginal notes were inserted at pertinent places in the works. The book at Lanhydrock does not contain any of Henry's handwriting but has a number of the characteristic wavy lines accompanied by a £ symbol used by the annotators. Such material was used in the years leading up to the king's marriage to Anne Boleyn in 1533, the Act of Supremacy in 1534 and the establishment of an independent English church. At some point in the 17th century the book was acquired by Hannibal Gamon, a collector of many early scholarly books, whose signature is on the title page. He later bequeathed his many such books to the Robartes family at Lanhydrock, a country house which was remodelled in the 1880s following a destructive fire. Paul Holden, house and collections manager at Lanhydrock, said: 'To have such an interesting book in the collection is fascinating in itself but to find out that it was once owned by Henry VIII, and played a part in a pivotal moment in British history, is very exciting. 'We're really looking forward to seeing the reactions of visitors when they discover more about the story behind this remarkable volume.' Lanhydrock's library is among only a handful of pre-Civil War private libraries surviving in England. Monarchy And The Book exhibition will open at Lanhydrock on March 1 and run until the end of November.","Works by philosopher and theologian William of Ockham published in 1495 .

"This is the moment a leopard ended up with a porcupine's quill up its nose -  as it tried repeatedly to catch and eat the spikey creature. The predator was resting in a tree on the side of the road in Kruger National Park in South Africa when its unsuspecting prey wandered past. Measuring a metre and a half in length, the leopard pounced and moved in for the kill - but ended up with some of the porcupine's quills planted in its mouth and paw. Prickly customer: The predator was resting in a tree on the side of the road in Kruger National Park in South Africa when its unsuspecting prey wandered past . Battle scars: The leopard was injured during its tussle with the porcupine, ending up with quills planted in its mouth and paw . Lunchtime: This leopard found itself in a prickly situation - as it tried to make a snack out of an adult porcupine in a wildlife reserve in South Africa . Moving in for the kill: The leopard, measuring a metre and a half in length, was waiting in a tree and pounced when it saw the porcupine walk past . Traffic came to a halt as the startled porcupine made its way across the road in a desperate escape bid. After the leopard was injured in its initial attack, it backed away from its prey and then went in for a second assault. The porcupine managed to make it across the road but was eventually taken down by the big cat. Yusuf Chavoos was driving his car through the National Park when he saw the two animals emerge from the trees and captured the dramatic tussle.

Yusuf Chavoos was driving his car through the National Park when he saw the two animals emerge from the trees and captured the dramatic tussle on camera . He said: 'It looked like the leopard was trying to get to the porcupine's belly or hind legs as there are less quills there. 'Compared to the leopard, the porcupine was moving very slowly across the road.' The 42-year-old optometrist from Johannesburg jumped out of his car to capture the action. He said: 'The porcupine looked very shocked and afraid. 'It is incredibly rare to see a leopard attack a porcupine. It is dangerous for leopards to do this as they can get injured by the quills. 'It is difficult to express how I felt when I saw this, but I would say I felt lucky and blessed to have witnessed something so rare.' The leopard, pictured lying on its side, tried a number of different tactics to avoid being spiked by the porcupine which was defending itself with its quills . End of the road: After the leopard was injured in its initial attack, it backed away from its prey and then went in for a second deadly assault . Captured: Despite managing to make it across the road, the porcupine was eventually taken down by the leopard after it grabbed hold of the animal's leg .

"A former bank worker tried to slash his topless masseuse girlfriend's throat in a jealous rage after another man smiled at her in a salsa club, a court heard. Amish Kansagra, 28, turned up at the home of  Anna Imporowicz, in Brentford, west London, with a knife from the massage parlour they ran together the day after they rowed in the club. Kingston-upon-Thames Crown Court was told he held the knife to her throat saying 'you've made the wrong decision. You will die today.' Anna Imporowicz (arriving at court, left, and in modelling shot, right), a topless masseuse, told a court that her ex-boyfriend, Amish Kansagra, tried to stab her after they had a row in a salsa club when a man smiled at her . The pair began dating when Kansagra became a regular client of Ms Imporowicz, 35, who massaged her naked customers while either topless or wearing skimpy underwear. Kansagra quit his bank job and opened a new massage business in Ealing, west London, with Ms Imporowicz, originally from Warsaw in Poland. The court heard their 'happy relationship' ended the day before the stabbing after a man smiled at her in a Holborn salsa club in central London. Prosecutor Julian Jones said: 'When they got home he was shouting that Anna was a whore and Amish grabbed her phone and laptop and destroyed them.' He then allegedly shoved her against a fridge and the stairs before leaving and it is suggested he posted a skimpy-clothed image of her on Facebook with the caption: 'I'm a prostitute and proud of it.' They agreed to meet the next day on June 22 last year, but Kansagra had already armed himself with a 'big knife' he took from the massage parlour, the court heard. Mr Jones added: 'She saw Amish with the  knife in his hand and he shut the kitchen window and put the knife to her throat and said: ""You've made the wrong decision. You will die today"". 'He was trying to stab her neck and she felt him cut her neck and and she saw her blood and fell to the floor saying: ""I love you. Don't do this"". 'She described him as having gritted teeth and eyes ""Like the devil"" and he cut her neck again, harder and deeper, and used the tip of the knife to cut her gum.' Ms Imporowicz allegedly tried to flee out of the front door, but was pulled back by the defendant. Amish Kansagra, 28, (left) denies attempted murder and two counts of assault after he allegedly attacked his former girlfriend, Polish native Anna Imporowicz, who he met through her topless massage business . 'He still had the knife in one hand and the other hand around her neck and stabbed her in the side,' Mr Jones added. 'She escaped via a window and while she had one leg out Amish tried to stab her everywhere.' A passer-by, who so happened to be a retired nurse, came to her aid and as Kansagra fled the bloody scene he told passers-by his girlfriend had inflicted the injuries on herself, the court heard. 'The prosecution say this was a clear cut case of attempted murder, an intention to kill,' he said. Kansagra slept rough and travelled to Manchester and back, eventually giving himself up at Shoreditch Police Station, initially claiming he remembered nothing due to a three-day vodka binge, the court heard. 'He said she was the first person he had ever loved and that there was something inside him. 'He recalled stabbing Anna in the neck and seeing the blood and confirmed he was not acting in self-defence.' The jury also heard Kansagra flew into a jealous rage at a party the previous New Year's Eve and caused a scene when a guest became too friendly with Ms Imporowicz. 'A guy dropped a cocktail stick down her cleavage and later squeezed her bottom and Amish started swearing and scratched the man's nose,' said Mr Jones. Ms Imporowicz explained to the jury she first met Kansagra through her work. 'It was sensual massage and the masseuse would maybe be in her underwear or without a bra and the client would be without their underwear,' she said. 'It ends with hand relief,' she added, insisting sexual intercourse would not take place. Kansagra has pleaded not guilty to one count of attempted murder and two counts of assault, but has already admitted causing criminal damage, possessing a bladed article and inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Amish Kansagra took a knife from massage parlour he ran with girlfriend .

"The three officers involved in the death of unarmed Mexican man in Washington state fired 17 shots, including several that struck the former orchard worker but none that hit him in the back, a task force spokesman said Wednesday. The regional law enforcement task force is investigating the killing of Antonio Zambrano-Montes, which has led to protests and calls for a federal probe. Police said Zambrano-Montes was throwing rocks at the three officers, one of whom was Hispanic, and ignored commands to surrender. 17 Shots: The three officers involved in the death of Antonio Zambrano-Montes (photographed) fired 17 shots, including several that struck the former orchard worker but none that hit him in the back . Authorities say a stun gun failed to subdue the man and the shooting, captured on video, appears to show the man moving away from police when he was shot. About one hundred friends and family members attended a funeral for Zambrano-Montes Wednesday at St. Patrick's Wednesday. Kennewick Police Sgt. Ken Lattin, a spokesman for the unit, said at a news conference that five or six bullets struck Zambrano-Montes. However, he said autopsy results were pending, and he couldn't be more specific about where the 35-year-old was shot. Mother: Here, Agapita Montes-Rivera (center), the mother of Zambrano-Montes, is comforted following the funeral for her son . Suit: The family sued the city for $25 million but has since been withdrawn as the family's attorney claims the case needs further investigation photographed is Zambrano-Montes' mother . Crucifix: Here, Montes-Rivera (left) places a crucifix on the coffin of her son during his funeral service . Zambrano-Montes was killed Feb. 10 in Pasco, and a witness captured the gunfire on video. The death has sparked two weeks of protests in this agricultural city along the Columbia River in the southeastern part of the state. Demonstrators have accused Pasco police of using overly aggressive tactics when dealing with those in the Hispanic community. Protesters have equated the shooting to that of the unarmed black men killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri and New York City. Moving Away: Authorities say a stung gun failed to subdue the man and the shooting, captured on video, appears to show the man moving away from police when he was shot . Surrender: Police said Zambrano-Montes was throwing rocks at the three officers, one of whom was Hispanic, and ignored commands to surrender . Civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, who represented the families of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and Tamir Rice, was representing Zambrano-Montes family but the family has since received new counsel. The family's case has been taken up by Seattle attorney Charles Herrmann, the Latin Post reports. The family sued the city for $25 million but has since been withdrawn as the family's attorney claims the case needs further investigation into the police department's policies. Protests: The death has sparked two weeks of protests in this agricultural city along the Columbia River in the southeastern part of the state . Overly Aggressive: Demonstrators have accused Pasco police of using overly aggressive tactics when dealing with those in the Hispanic community . Authorities say the Mexican immigrant was throwing rocks at officers and a stun gun failed to subdue him. The Franklin County coroner has ordered an inquest into the death, which is being reviewed by the task force. The investigation is being monitored by federal authorities. Lattin said the local investigation will be thorough and fair. 'We're not here to cover up for anybody,' he told reporters. Daughter: Here, Erika Zambrano (photographed) holds a photo of her father, shooting victim Antonio Zambrano-Montes . The killing was the fourth by police in less than a year for fast-growing Pasco, a city of 68,000 where more than half the residents are Hispanic but few are members of the police force or the power structure. Officers were exonerated after similar investigations in the first three cases. Critics of the latest case say the officers should have used less than lethal force to capture Zambrano-Montes. Police said officers felt threatened. Zambrano-Montes was arrested last year for assault after throwing objects at Pasco officers and trying to grab an officer's pistol, court records show.","Antonio Zambrano-Montes was shot at 17 times by Pasco police officers but recent reports reveal he was not shot in the back .

"McDonald's has been accused of super-sized tax avoidance after apparently dodging more than £700million worth of taxes across Europe. The American fast food chain funnelled billions of pounds through Luxembourg to reduce its tax bill significantly, according to a report. Luxembourg has controversially been used as a tax haven by many multi-nationals because it allows companies to pay as little as 1 per cent tax on income. Now, McDonald’s has been branded ‘shameful’ after claims it used an ‘aggressive’ tax loophole to avoid paying around £730million over five years. Appetising: A quarter-pounder from McDonald's, which has been branded 'shameful' over accusations it used a Luxembourg offshoot to avoid paying about £730million to the UK tax man over five years . According to British charity War On Want – which tackles poverty around the world – McDonald’s opened a Luxembourg-based offshoot called McD Europe Franchising Sarl in 2009, to deal with royalty revenues paid by franchises using its brand. This happened ‘immediately after’ a policy change in the country which allowed these kinds of intellectual property firms to pay lower taxes on income. The company then routed billions in royalties from its European operations to the Luxembourg outpost, minimising its tax liabilities, the report said. That same year, McDonald’s also shifted its European headquarters from London to low-tax Geneva, which was viewed as another attempt to reduce its liabilities. ‘As a result, McDonald’s engaged in aggressive and potentially abusive optimisation of its structure which has led to the avoidance of significant amounts of tax,’ the review said. ‘This structure is likely to have cost European governments over 1billion euros [£727million] in lost tax revenues between 2009 and 2013.’ Britain is the third largest European market for McDonald’s after Germany and France, meaning the UK could have lost out on millions of pounds. The report found that McDonald’s Luxembourg branch registered revenues of £2.7billion over five years, but paid less than £12million of tax. If it had kept these royalties in Europe as ‘profit’, rather than diverting them through Luxembourg, it would have had to pay more than 60 times this amount. And if it had kept its headquarters in the UK and paid British corporation tax on all the royalties it earned from its European subsidiaries, HM Revenue and Customs could have netted up to £818million extra between 2009 and 2013. Even if McDonald’s had only paid UK corporation tax on the money it made from British royalties, the taxman would have received £75million more. McDonalds in Uxbridge: Britain is the third largest European market for the American burger chain . While the schemes are not illegal, firms are coming under growing pressure to pay tax in the country they sell their goods – rather than where various headquarters are based. Amazon, Ikea, Pepsi and Disney are among the other corporations accused of pushing profits through Luxembourg to reduce their tax bill. And McDonald’s has already faced scrutiny of its tax practices in France, with authorities visiting its Paris office last year. European Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said the report ‘will be carefully processed’, the Financial Times reported. It was co-written by War On Want alongside three US and European trade unions – EPSU, EFFAT and SEIU. Jan Willem Goudriaan, of EPSU, said: ‘It is shameful to see that a multibillion euro company, that pays low wages, still seeks to avoid its responsibility to pay its fair share of much-needed taxes to finance public services we all rely on.’ A McDonald’s spokesman said: ‘McDonald’s complies with applicable laws, including payments of the taxes that are owed in each country in which we operate. A significant amount of tax is also paid by our franchisees, who make up 73 per cent of McDonald’s restaurant estate in Europe.’","War On Want traced McDonald's finances through the tiny country .

"A photographer hoping to capture the perfect shot of a snowy field in Tennessee ended up saving the life of a missing elderly woman who he found huddled on the ground near a crashed car. Patricia Madden, 74, of Bellevue, went missing on Wednesday when she failed to show up at a horse farm. She was found on Friday morning by photographer Keith Sheldon, who rode up a little-used road in Franklin, Tennessee to find a quiet place to shoot around 9.30am. It was when he was started snapping that he noticed something in the scene wasn't right. Scroll down for video . A photographer found a missing woman frozen to the ground - but alive - in a Tennessee field on Friday . The woman, identified as 74-year-old Patricia Madden - had been missing for two days in the freezing temperatures . Nearby he noticed an abandoned car, crashed into a ditch and beyond that a mound that he soon realized was a woman's body, curled up in the fetal position with her hands in her brown coat. It was only 12 degrees out. 'She was lying right there against that dirt bank and she blended in, [she] had a brown coat on and it looked just like the dirt,' Sheldon told WKRN. When Sheldon called out to the woman and she didn't respond, he walked over and noticed she was indeed still alive. 'I was sent there for a reason': Keith Sheldon (pictured) is the photographer who found Madden in Franklin on Friday . 'When I got next to her, she opened her eyes,' Sheldon said. He then called 911 and waited the ten minutes it took paramedics to arrive on the small rural road. It was so cold out that when Sheldon and paramedics tried to lift Madden up from the ground, they heard the ground crack as it released her frozen-on coat. Madden was taken to the hospital where she was treated for hypothermia and released to her family the next day. It's now known how long she was outside for. Her family says this isn't the first time Madden has gone missing and that she has suffered a series of 'brain injuries' from horseback riding which may have disoriented her. Madden's daughter added that her mother didn't have the insight not to drive in a rural area in icy conditions, according to WKRN. On Saturday  her daughter issued a thank you not to first responders and city leaders who helped run the search for her mother. The letter reads: 'I am writing to give my family’s heartfelt thanks to the men and women… who helped rescue my mom. 'I know that law enforcement’s reputation has taken a hit recently, but my faith in greater good and the service of our officers has never wavered. At least 30 people have died in Tennessee this past week as a winter storm has raged across the region. Sheldon is glad that he helped save one more fatality from appearing on that list. 'I was sent there for a reason,' he told WSMV.","Patricia Madden, 74, went missing on Wednesday when she failed to show up as expected at a horse farm .

"A professional wakeskater achieved a world’s first after successfully negotiating the water and surrounding snow of the Studeni Potok creek, known by Bosnian locals as the Dragon’s Tail. According to Red Bull, Brian Grubb travelled to the mountain of Bjelasnica, which sits 25km from where the 1984 Winter Olympics were held in Sarajevo, to attempt the experimental feat. Dating back to the late 1970s, the sport of wakeskating started in the form of freeboarding or wakesurfing. Scroll down for video . Brain had to find a balanced speed so that he would be able to stay afloat while on the water and on his feet while on the snow . Attempting a number of jumps and tricks, the wakeskater negotiates the creek with effortless skill . Riders would originally surf behind boats with long boards until the sport evolved and shorter boards, which were easier to do tricks with, were preferred. Different to the similar water sport of wakeboarding, wakestakers are not attached to their boards meaning crashes are more prevalent. Brian initially intended to ride the creek in the summer, but later deduced that it would be easier to do so in the winter as connecting a fluid line, which would allow him to move between the snow and water, would be more achievable. Pulled by a 1300ft winch line, the video shows the 34-year-old negotiating the creek effortlessly. Carving his way through the water, he switches seamlessly between the untouched snow and the water before jumping into the air and landing a challenging trick. Despite the fluidity of his movements however, the biggest challenge faced by the wakeskater during the experiment involved him finding a balanced speed. A ramp incorporated into course results in an impressive jump, but also adds to the number of entertaining crashes . Speaking on the video, Brian said: ‘I wanted different speeds for being in the snow and then in the water. ‘I had to be going faster in the water so I didn't sink but then in the snow going that speed just felt really fast so it was kind of challenging. ‘But once we got the line figured out it was really fun to just session it.’ Skating on the water and carving on the snow, Brian moves seamlessly between the elements in and around the creek . Although Brian does achieve a smooth and successful run of the creek, his experimental wakeboarding session is not without its fair share of impressive wipe-outs. And a ramp incorporated into the course – which later produces one of the videos most impressive moments – has Brian crashing into the snowy banks on a number of occasions. Speaking on the video, Brian said: ‘We ultimately just want to inspire people to think outside the box and maybe to take a sport that you would only see in the summer time into the winter and into the snow. Attached to a  1300ft winch line, the wakeskater is pulled through the snowy creek at quite a pace . A pioneer in his field, Brian has had some impressive wins on the Pro Wakeskate Tour, Vans Triple Crown, U.S. Nationals, the Wakeskating World Championships, and the Byerly Toe Jam Tour . ‘We really had fun riding in these conditions and being here in Bosnia.’ Brian Grubb is a pioneer in the field of wakeskating and has had some impressive wins on the Pro Wakeskate Tour, Vans Triple Crown, U.S. Nationals, the Wakeskating World Championships, and the Byerly Toe Jam Tour.","Brian Grubb travelled 25km from where the 1984 Winter Olympics were held in Sarajevo to attempt the  feat .

"A woman allegedly depicted in a pornographic video made at a university library is now trying to rally fraternity brothers to come to her defense. Kendra Sunderland, 19, faces a potential jail sentence and fine if convicted of public indecency. Court documents say, 'The defendant, on or about January 27, 2015, did and with the intent of arousing the sexual desire of defendant or another person, expose her genitals; contrary to statute and against the peace and dignity of the State of Oregon.' The documents - obtained and published by the Smoking Gun - accused Sunderland of committing public indecency on the sixth floor of Valley Library at Oregon State University. Scroll down for video .

The video reportedly shows the 19-year-old performing a sex act and flashing the camera. Sunderland, who attended OSU but dropped out, asked in a since-deleted Wednesday Facebook post for assistance from fraternity members. The post read 'Dear Oregon State Frat Brothers I need your help, comment here and we will DM...and please no dumb replies, this is a serious issue regarding my court date tomorrow.' She later lashed out on Facebook at the school's Interfraternity Council. Sunderland alleged 'The OSU Frat Council wants to take away people's right to protest [sic]. What do you think?' Attached was a selfie showing her giving the camera the middle finger, as well as a link to an article on MStarz.

She posted a photograph showing her flipping the middle finger (right) on Wednesday . Scene:  Sunderland has been accused of committing public indecency on the sixth floor of Valley Library at Oregon State University . The article included a message allegedly written by OSU Interfraternity Council President Michael Conan to FriendFinder Networks CEO Ken Hawks, requesting that Hawks refrain from contacting OSU fraternity members to protest on Sunderland's behalf. Conan stated that fraternity chapters were warned of 'judicial ramifications' for their participation. Conan declined to comment to Daily Mail Online, referring questions to OSU spokesman Steve Clark. Clark said he was aware of Conan's reported remarks. OSU's Interfraternity Council did not respond to a request for comment. Hawk said Conan sent him the text message on Tuesday at 12:02AM PST. According to the Smoking Gun, Sunderland may be forced to pay a $6,250 fine and spend as much as one year in prison. Her arraignment is planned for Thursday, the website reported. An Oregon State Police log written by Trooper Christopher Graves said 'On January 27, 2015 at approximately 2:30pm I was tasked to looking into a complaint of a video of a female that was posted to a pornographic site claiming that the solo act that was being performed occured [sic] in the Oregon State University library. I was able to identify the suspect as the female [redacted]. The suspect was cited for Public Indecency [sic] and released.' The log was obtained and published by the Oregonian in January.

Daily Mail Online earlier reported that Sunderland is behind the website Date Broke College Girls. 'I created this site to match college girls like me who are struggling to pay for school and looking for a rich older boyfriend,' she wrote online. 'Hopefully this will keep them from getting naked in the library and help them use it to study!' In early February, the New York Daily News reported that Sunderland began performing in webcam videos during a failed job search in Fall 2013 for a waitress position, when she was still a OSU student. 'Working a minimum wage job, there's people that are just mean to you when they're having a crappy day,' Sunderland told the newspaper. 'On MyFreeCams, [users] had nothing but nice things to say. And I made way more than I would working any other job.' The New York Daily News reported that Sunderland made approximately $700 from filming the on-campus webcam video in October, before soon leaving school and making more videos. Clark told the newspaper that Sunderland was banned from school grounds. A MyFreeCams attorney also told the New York Daily News that Sunderland's video violated the guidelines for the website, and she is banned. Both the Benton County District Attorney's office and Sunderland did not respond to requests for comment. Sunderland's attorney, Michael Flinn, said Wednesday 'What I can tell you is this: We believe the charge should never have been filed, but we will appear in court tomorrow to start a vigorous defense against it.' A publicist for Sunderland said a comment would be made after the Thursday arraignment.","Kendra Sunderland made waves online for a webcam video that allegedly depicted her in a sex act at a university library .

"The grandparents of tragic young girl Chloe Valentine have slammed Families SA, saying they could have prevented the death of their four-year-old granddaughter. Speaking to ABC's 7.30 program ahead of the final day of the inquest into Chloe's death, Belinda Valentine and her partner said the social workers 'absolutely' failed in their duty of care over the young girl. Chloe died in 2012 from head injuries sustained after being forced to ride a motorbike three times her weight for days on end by her drug addicted mother Ashley Polkinghorne and her partner at the time. Scroll down for video . Belinda Valentine (left) has slammed Families SA  saying they could have saved her granddaughter Chloe Valentine's (right) life . Chloe died in 2012 from head injuries sustained after being forced to ride a motorbike three times her weight for days on end by her drug addicted mother Ashley Polkinghorne and her partner at the time . Belinda Valentine (left) and her partner (right) said social workers 'absolutely' failed in their duty of care over the young girl . Her mother, Ashlee Polkinghorne, 22, and Polkinghorne's then-partner Benjamin McPartland, 28, are in jail after pleading guilty to Chloe's manslaughter through criminal neglect. But Belinda Valentine, like so many others, said Chloe's life could have been saved had Families SA intervened, or took Ms Valentine up on her offer of taking the youngster into her care. 'From when Chloe was a tiny infant we offered and offered in fact at times we begged,' the grandmother told the ABC. 'We contacted Families SA on a regular basis and told them our concerns and they weren't everyday concerns, these were concerns that were valid, they were serious, and they just weren't taken in that way,' Ms Valentine added. The grandmother recalled an incident in 2009 when she was called by her daughter Ashley after she had been beaten by her boyfriend at the time. Ms Valentine said she found Chloe cowering and terrified, and she called a social worker - Leanne Stewart - from the house with the young girl still in her arms. The inquest has heard Chloe was forced to endure chronic neglect at the hands of her drug-using teenage mother Ashlee Polkinghorne (left) and her partner Benjamin Robert McPartland (right) Belinda Valentine said she repeatedly begged authorities to take Chloe off her parents and into her care . 'I told her what we would like to do and she said to me you can't tell Ashley where she should live and you have no right to take Chloe, I'm not giving you permission to take Chloe at all. 'Ashley just laughed at us. And I said to her look, I want to speak to your supervisor, I need to speak to someone higher than you and she said 'I am the supervisor',' Ms Valentine revealed. However Ms Stewart has denied in court that this conversation even took place. Chloe's grandmother also revealed the heartbreak of watching footage of Chloe fall off the motorbike sustaining injuries which would later lead to her death. 'To see her alive, but in the last few hours of her life was, it was heartbreaking. 'And to hear Ashley's manic laughter, and to see Ben throw her onto the motorbike and her crashing, you just don't want to go there, you don't want to think about she must have been thinking and feeling without anyone there to protect her,' Ms Valentine told the ABC through tears. Ms Valentine said she called social worker Leanne Stewart from the scene of a domestic dispute pleading to take Chloe away from Ashley . However Ms Stewart (pictured) denied in court that such a phone call ever took place . The inquest into Chloe's death with be finalised on Friday . A veteran social worker also told the program he believed 'without a doubt' Chloe could have been saved, if Families SA hadn't failed the toddler. Tony Tonkin said he could not recall an inquest of this depth or length during his time, and said he was deeply saddened by her story. Earlier this week during the inquest - which will come to a head on Friday - the head of Families SA said social workers missed opportunities to save Chloe. Department for Education and Child Development chief executive Tony Harrison said the young girl's case workers had placed too much weight on preserving family unity at the expense of ensuring the girl's safety, in the years leading to her death. 'There was a very, very strong emphasis to, at all costs, keep the family together,' he told the inquest into Chloe's death on Tuesday. 'With the benefit of hindsight, we would have to wonder whether we persisted with that approach for too long. At an inquest into her death on Tuesday authorities said social workers missed the chance to save Chloe Valentine, 4, who died of massive head injuries in 2012 . The young girl was forced to ride a motorbike for days on end by her drug addicted mother and her partner . 'We have to be prepared, at the right time as we determine it, to take a strong intervention because that's needed to keep children alive.' The inquest has heard Chloe was forced to endure chronic neglect at the hands of her drug-using teenage mother but was never removed by Families SA. Chloe was four when she died of massive head injuries after being forced to ride a motorbike that repeatedly crashed over a three-day period in the backyard of her Adelaide home in January 2012. Polkinghorne and McPartland waited more than eight hours before calling an ambulance after Chloe eventually became unconscious. A comprehensive review of Chloe's case had made clear that a 'circuit-breaker' was needed to save the girl from the chaos in her life . Mr Harrison, a former SA Police assistant commissioner who became head of the DECD in July 2013, said he strongly supported keeping families together and building the capability of parents within the child protection system. But a comprehensive review of Chloe's case had made clear that a 'circuit-breaker' was needed to save the girl from the chaos in her life. 'The question should have been asked as early as 2008 as to whether the removal of Chloe was appropriate,' he said. 'It seemed like we missed opportunities to consider the option of removing the child from the environment.' The coroner has asked why Chloe's mother Ashley was repeatedly given the benefit of the doubt . Families SA received 20 child abuse notifications during Chloe's short life from witnesses concerned about the girl's filthy, transient and unsafe living conditions . Families SA received 20 child abuse notifications during Chloe's short life from witnesses concerned about the girl's filthy, transient and unsafe living conditions, her mother's drug use and her exposure to domestic violence in the family home. State Coroner Mark Johns has questioned why Polkinghorne was often given the benefit of the doubt by social workers, who helped clean her house and avoided confronting her about her drug use. Mr Harrison admitted there was potential for social workers to be compromised by their intimate involvement in a case. 'There can be some blurring of objectivity as social workers build relationships with families,' he said. The inquest continues.","Chloe Valentine died from head injuries in 2012 after falling off motorbike .

"The 25-year-old daughter of Robin Williams has said there is 'no point' questioning why her father chose to take his own life six months ago, in the first time she has spoken publicly since the comedian's death. Zelda Williams, speaking with NBC's Kate Snow on Thursday's TODAY show, said she has chosen not to dwell but to look to the future, focusing on charity that will help continue her father's legacy. 'It's going to take a lot of work to allow myself to have the sort of fun, happy life that I had, but that's important,' she said in the sit-down. 'People are finally starting to approach talking about illnesses that people can't immediately see. (My father) talked about his alcoholism. He joked about it, which I think you're supposed to.

First interview: Zelda Williams, 25, spoke with NBC's Kate Snow on Thursday's TODAY show, six months after the death of her father, Robin Williams, 63, who committed suicide at his California home in August . Positive: Zelda said she has chosen not to dwell on the death of her father but look to continuing his legacy . She continued: 'It helped him not hide. If you have things that make you sad, express them to other people. 'I think it was important to him for people to talk about important things. 'He didn't like people feeling the things that were hard for them they should go through alone. 'And I think that's the big legacy, for me and for him and for my brothers. 'He, somehow, had an enormous amount of people in this world that he made feel they were a little less alone. 'People have their memories and they should enjoy them. 'The world keeps spinning, but it doesn't mean he was never on it.' Family first: Zelda  Robin Williams arrive at the premiere of World's Greatest Dad at The Landmark Theater in August 2009, in Los Angeles. Zelda says she knew a different side to the comedian loved by so many . Williams, who had a long history of depression, committed suicide at his home in Paradise Cay in San Francisco Bay on August 11, 2014, aged 63. Asked about the death of her father, Zelda said: 'There's no point questioning it and no point blaming anyone for it and there's no point blaming yourself or the world or whatever the case may be. 'Because it happened and you have to continue to move and you have to continue to live and manage.' Following William's death, Zelda posted a photo to Twitter showing a new tattoo on her right hand of a hummingbird, which is considered a symbol of resilience. However she further explained the meaning behind the inking. 'Hummingbirds are fun and flighty and strange' she said in the NBC interview. 'It's hard to keep them in one place and Dad was a bit like that. 'Keeping a conversation in one moment was impossible with him. 'It's almost like trying to put a bag around a storm and hope it wouldn't blow away. 'Some days are going to be difficult (without him), and having a reminder that is permanently there is nice.' Personal: Zelda said Thursday that she got the hummingbird tattoo in memory of her father because 'they are fun and flighty and strange' Memories: Robin Williams is seen here with his middle child, daughter Zelda, in an undated photo . On Friday, Zelda will accept the Noble Award that honors her father's humanitarianism and his work with the Challenged Athlete Foundation, a charity that provides prosthetics to disabled athletes. However Zelda would not speak about the current court battle over her father's estate. Williams had his eldest son, Zachary, 32, with first wife Valerie Velardi. He later married Marsha Garces, Zachary's nanny, and had Zelda and Cody, 24, but they separated in 2008. In 2011 Williams married his third wife, graphic designer Susan Schneider. In papers filed in December in San Francisco Superior Court, Susan Williams, says some of the late actor's personal items were taken without her permission and asks the court to exclude the contents of the Tiburon home that she shared with Williams from the jewelry, memorabilia and other items that Williams said the children should have. The children counter that Susan Williams is 'adding insult to a terrible injury' by trying to change the trust agreement and rob them of the late actor's clothing and other personal items. 'The Williams' children are heartbroken that Petitioner, Mr. Williams' wife of less than three years, has acted against his wishes by challenging the plans he so carefully made for his estate,' attorneys for the children said in court papers. FlashbackL Robin Williams walks on Madison Avenue in New York with second wife Marsha Garces Williams and their daughter Zelda Williams, then 16, in March 2006 . James Wagstaffe, an attorney for Susan Williams, said Monday that his client was only seeking guidance from the court about the meaning of certain terms in the trust. 'This is not ugly,' he said. 'I would not say this is anticipated to be a highly contested proceeding.' An attorney for the children, Allan Mayer, declined to comment. Williams death was ruled a suicide that resulted from asphyxia caused by hanging. Susan Williams has said the actor and comedian was struggling with depression, anxiety and a recent diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Williams had publicly acknowledged periodic struggles with substance abuse, and he had entered a substance abuse program shortly before his death. According to the coroner's report, his wife told an investigator that Williams did not go there because of recent drug or alcohol abuse, but rather to reaffirm the principles of his rehabilitation. Williams' trust granted his children his memorabilia and awards in the entertainment industry and some other specific personal items, according to court documents. Susan Williams says that because he wanted her to continue to live at the Tiburon home, it makes sense that he intended only for his children to have the specific personal items he delineated that were kept at another home he owned in Napa. 'Any other interpretation would lead to Mrs. Williams' home being stripped while Mrs. Williams still lives there,' her attorneys wrote. The children dispute that interpretation, saying there were no specific limits on the location of those items. The two sides also disagree over items put in storage, watches Williams owned and his memorabilia.","Zelda Williams, 25, spoke on TODAY on Thursday, six months after Robin Williams, 63, committed suicide at his California home .

Guilty: Eddie Ray Routh, 27, was convicted of capital murder by a jury in Texas after just two hours of deliberations on Tuesday evening and has been sentenced to life in prison without parole . Ahead of the trial, Routh's lawyers had argued that the popularity of the movie, which grossed $300 million at the box office, would mean he could not get a fair trial. And speaking on Good Morning America on Wednesday, the jurors admitted some of them had seen the movie - but insisted they had put that out of their minds when making their decision. 'It gave me a better outlook on Chris' role as a Marine,' one of the jurors, Barrett Hutchinson, said. 'But as far as the actions that took place on February 2, Chad was still in the picture and Chad was not in that movie. 'I took the fact that Chris was a marine out of my mind and looked at him as a person, looked at Chad as a person, looked at Eddie as a person and, you know, tried to make reasonable judgment.' Also on Wednesday, Chad Littlefield's family spoke out about the verdict. 'It was an answered prayer,' Judy Littlefield told the Today show. 'We've waited a long time to hear that. We feel justice has been served.' Relief: The parents of victim Chad Littlefield, Judy and Don Littlefield, pictured right, and his brother-in-law Jerry Richardson, left, said the guilty verdict for his killer 'was an answered prayer' Beloved: Chad Littlefield, pictured above left and right, was not a veteran but was committed to helping them when they returned from overseas, his parents said. He was shot dead by Routh in February 2013 . Routh's brother-in-law added that he never once believed Routh had been insane. Routh's attorneys had tried to prove he was in a psychotic state at the time of the killings. 'It was all an act,' Jerry Richardson said. 'I taught him in high school and... that's just the way he was. He never grew up. He was still just opposite defiant, and he had nothing wrong in the mind except for the drug use.' Chad's father Don remembered his son as a 'quiet man' and 'a good listener' who met Kyle at their children's soccer practices. The two men shared an interest in working out and helping veterans, Don said. Chad himself was not a veteran but wanted to help others. 'Chris served overseas and Chad served when they came back,' Mrs Littlefield explained. Mr Littlefield added: 'His motto was pass it forward.' Kyle's widow, Taya Kyle, testified in the trial but has not spoken out since the verdict. She was seen in the courtroom on Tuesday but did not return when the decision was read. Fair trial? Jury members also spoke out on Wednesday and said they had 'no doubt' Routh was guilty - but they also admitted that some of them had seen the 'American Sniper' movie ahead of the trial . Chris Kyle's brother and parents were seen hugging and crying inside the courtroom after the verdict, but they did not issue a statement. As prosecutors decided not to pursue the death penalty, the only possible sentence for Routh was life in prison - with no chance of parole. Kyle and Littlefield had taken Routh to the shooting range at Rough Creek Lodge and Resort on February 2, 2013, after Routh's mother asked Kyle to help her troubled son. Family members say Routh suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder from serving in Iraq and in Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake. Defense attorneys noted that Kyle had described Routh as 'straight-up nuts' in a text message to Littlefield as they drove to the luxury resort and asked Littlefield to watch his back. While at the shooting range, Routh first opened fire on Littlefield, then turned on Kyle, whom he shot six times. He later said he was 'riled up' because Littlefield wasn't joining in with the shooting, then murdered Kyle too because he knew he would kill him. Psychiatrists for the defense also claimed Routh believed the men were human-pig hybrids who were going to assassinate him. Families: Deby Kyle, Chris Kyle's mother (right) is seen leaving the courtroom after the verdict, alongside Judy and Don Littlefield (left), whose son Chris was killed at the same time . After shooting the men dead, he fled in Kyle's pickup truck, drove to see family members and even stopped at Taco Bell. He was eventually arrested after a police chase and later confessed to the crime on video, which was played to the jury. Among evidence entered by prosecutors was a recorded phone call between Routh and a reporter  in which Routh said he was annoyed Littlefield wasn't shooting. 'Are you gonna shoot? Are you gonna shoot? It's a shooting sport. You shoot,' Routh said in the phone call. 'That's what got me all riled up.' Routh's friends and family testified that his behavior in the weeks before the shootings was increasingly erratic and that 'he did not seem all there' after gunning down the two men. Routh, who served with the Marines in Iraq and Haiti, had been admitted to Veterans Affairs hospitals on multiple occasions after his service to treat mental illness. They said he was unable to care for himself, acted as if he believed that someone was going to hurt him and thought that the government was listening to him. Caught: Routh is pictured in the back of a police car after he fled the scene of the murder in Kyle's truck before he was eventually caught. He claimed he shot the two men because he feared they would kill him . This pistol, found in Kyle's truck, which Routh fled in, matched bullet fragments found in Littlefield's body . Confession: Routh, pictured hours after the killings, confessed to the shootings almost immediately . 'It was clear that he was psychotic,' Mitchell H. Dunn, a forensic psychiatrist for the defense, told the court on Thursday. 'There was no question about that.' But the jury rejected the claim after prosecutors contended Routh knew what he was doing and acted deliberately when he shot the two and then fled. They said any bizarre behavior was the result of Routh's reliance on marijuana. He had smoked the drug with his uncle the morning before the shootings. A prosecution expert, Dr. Michael Arambula, said Routh's actions do not meet the legal definition of insanity under state criminal law. 'Any time intoxication is present, the game is over,' Arambula testified.","Eddie Ray Routh, 27, was found guilty on Tuesday evening of murdering Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield at a shooting range in February 2013 .

"A BBC programme featuring 'dynamite' interview tapes with Princess Diana was axed amid fears it would upset the royal family, it is claimed . The BBC allegedly wasted £500,000 on a documentary featuring 'dynamite' interviews with Princess Diana - but later shelved it because it did not want to upset the monarchy, it has been claimed. According to the director behind a controversial documentary about the Princess of Wales, the BBC went on to give a misleading account of why the programme was not broadcast. The Corporation said at the time that Diana: Her Story, Her Words, due to be broadcast on the tenth anniversary of her death, did not sufficiently add to the story of Diana's life. But, in another controversial documentary being aired tonight, it is claimed the BBC stopped its broadcast amid fears it would upset the Royal Family close to Prince's Charles 60th birthday. The extraordinary claims are featured in Reinventing The Royals, which hit the headlines late last year after Clarence House allegedly tried to stop the programme being broadcast - a claim it vehemently denies. Diana: Her Story, Her Words, made by award-winning director Kevin Sim, had included extracts from video tapes of the Princess, taped in 1992 and 1993. The tapes have been broadcast only once – on American television network NBC, in 2004. Such was the controversy caused by their screening that the tapes were not sold to other broadcasters. But, three years later, the BBC spent more than £30,000 buying an option to broadcast three minutes of the tapes for the programme. The documentary was later axed, with the BBC claiming it did not 'add' to Diana's story - despite having spent hundreds of thousands on its production. But, in Reinventing the Royals, Mr Sim apparently casts down on why the BBC stopped the recordings being aired. According to the The Daily Express, he tells the programme:  'We had a considerable amount of taped interviews with Diana - in terms of giving you the key to Diana the woman, these were dynamite.' He adds: 'We were told, ""well, it's quite difficult – Prince Charles is 60 and we've got exclusive access to him, with Charles, and we don't really want to offend him at this juncture. We wouldn't want to do anything at all, for example, that would mean he would pull out of the film"".' The tapes were compiled by Diana's voice coach Peter Settelen, an American actor now based in Britain, over several sessions. Diana, shy by nature, employed him to help her practise public speaking as she became increasingly independent of Prince Charles. Scroll down for video . The director behind the documentary claims the BBC cancelled the show because it did not want to upset the Royal Family near to Prince Charles's 60th birthday . At the time, her marriage was in deep crisis and the conversations with Mr Settelen – which were never intended to be made public – inevitably dwelled on her private concerns. Peter Settelen recorded 16 tapes during his coaching sessions with Princess Diana at Kensington Palace . She talked frankly about her relationship with the Prince, his affair with Camilla Parker Bowles and her love for her bodyguard, Barry Mannakee, and her suspicions that he had been murdered after he died in a traffic accident. Mr Settelen recorded 16 tapes during his coaching sessions at Kensington Palace. Seven of the so-called ‘dynamite diaries’ were discovered in 2001 when detectives raided the house of Diana’s former butler, Paul Burrell. Mr Settelen fought a long legal battle with her estate for control of the tapes, which he then sold to NBC for an undisclosed sum. After purchasing the tapes, the BBC commissioned Mr Sim to oversee the film. The highly-regarded director has won a Bafta for a Dispatches programme on the Beslan school massacre, while his examination of Iran, titled Once Upon A Time In Iran, and his film on the Tsunami, Seven Hours On Boxing Day, were both highly praised. The Corporation had planned to show the programme in August 2007, with the authentic voice of Diana as the key selling point, to stand it apart from other films being made  to mark the anniversary. But, shortly beforehand, the BBC decided to axe the show, claiming it added nothing to Diana's story. According to Mr Sim, the BBC had at the time obtained exclusive access to Prince Charles for a film marking his 60th birthday and feared upsetting the Palace. A BBC spokeswoman said the decision-makers no longer worked at the BBC and it was therefore 'difficult to comment further.' The comments are made as part of Reinventing The Royals, a two-part documentary presented by Steve Hewlett (centre) and which attracted controversy before it was aired due to an alleged row over footage . Controversial: Hewlett was editor of Panorama when it broadcast the infamous 1995 Princess Diana interview . Reinventing the Royals, a two-part series written and presented by Panorama journalist Steve Hewlett, aired last week. The series opened with the death of Princess Diana in 1997, with the first episode focusing on the brickbats hurled at Prince Charles in its wake. With his personal popularity in the doldrums, Charles asked PR guru Mark Bolland, who was hired in 1996, to give his public image a makeover and integrate Camilla Parker Bowles into palace life. Dubbed 'Operation Mrs PB', the campaign is the source of one of the most embarrassing allegations aired in the programme - namely that Bolland leaked news of Prince William's first meeting with Camilla to the media. Bolland has denied this incident ever happened, but the Duke of Cambridge was reportedly left angry and upset by the leak and is said to have nicknamed the PR supremo 'Blackadder'. But the contents of the documentary was overshadowed by the controversy over the programme itself. Campaign: Much of the controversy focuses on Mark Bolland (left) and Sandy Henney (right) also features . The programme was initially delayed, allegedly due to a dispute over footage. Clarence House denied it had tried to interfere, saying: 'The original broadcast of the programme was delayed by mutual agreement (BBC and Clarence House) whilst permissions were sought. 'All permissions were subsequently granted. We have not seen the programme yet and have no comment to make.' Nevertheless, the ensuing row reportedly left Prince Charles 'furious' - all the more so when lurid claims of spats between the Buckingham Palace and Clarence House press teams emerged. Meanwhile, the BBC had said the documentary was always going to be aired. A spokesman had said: 'Before Christmas it became clear that there were issues relating to the clearance of archive footage in the forthcoming programme Reinventing The Royals. 'These issues have now been resolved and all the archive material we planned to use is included in the finished programme. 'The first episode of Reinventing The Royals will be broadcast on 19 February and it will be the one that we always intended to show.' Princess Diana, the first wife of Prince Charles, was killed in a horrific car crash in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris in August 1997. She died aged 36. At the time, the Queen faced criticism for failing to capture the mood of the grieving nation. Public anger began after the Queen took Prince William and Prince Harry to church at Balmoral, just a few hours after Prince Charles had broken the news to them of their mother's death. There were also accusations that the Queen remained in Scotland for too long, and did not return quickly enough to London, where thousands had gathered in united grief over the Diana's death. Compounding the Queen’s absence was the lack of any flag flying at half-mast above Buckingham Palace as a sign of royal mourning.","Tapes were recorded by Diana's voice coach Peter Settelen in early 90s .

"Joanne Norris, 28, mother to three-year-old Lily (together above) and her unborn baby died after she walked in front of a train at Witham Station, Essex . A pregnant woman killed herself by walking into the path of a train after a doctor failed to warn her about the side-effects of an anti-anxiety drug, an inquest heard. Joanne Norris, 28, and her unborn baby died after she walked into the path of a speeding train at Witham station, Essex, on March 16 last year. An inquest at Essex County Coroner's Court in Chelmsford heard how married Mrs Norris, who already had a three-year-old daughter called Lily, had suffered with anxiety since the age of 17. Coroner Michelle Brown said opportunities to help her were missed in the run-up to her death. The inquest heard how minutes before her death, Mrs Norris sent a text message to her husband Jeff which said: 'I love you and Lily with all my heart, it's not your fault I'm like this, I can't cope anymore, I'm sorry.' The hearing was told that the teaching assistant had a long-term prescription for anti-anxiety drug Venlafaxine to help manage her symptoms but stopped taking the drug on doctors' advice when she fell pregnant with her second child. However, she was prescribed Diazepam after complaining of constant morning sickness and  was put back on a low-dosage of Venlafaxine in February last year after telling her GP, Dr Adekunle Olowu, that she was 'unable to cope'. The inquest heard that Dr Olowu failed to warn her of the possible side-effects of the anti-depressant. During the hearing, Norris family counsel Vanessa Marshall grilled Dr Owolu about the decision to prescribe Venlafaxine again. She asked him: 'Isn't it the case that in the early stages of taking Venlafaxine it can cause an increased risk of self-harm or suicidal thoughts? 'That is an established side-effect of the medication in some cases. 'It was irrelevant that she had taken it over the years. Each period of taking it is different.' Dr Olowu said he did not consider there to be a risk due to the reduced amount prescribed, as well as Mrs Norris' previous experience taking the medication, but admitted he did not warn her of the increased risk. The inquest also heard how on the day of her death Mrs Norris phoned a mental health crisis team twice and informed them that she was having thoughts about jumping in front of a train. A nurse arranged a visit to her house later that day but when she arrived four hours later Mrs Norris had already died. The coroner returned a verdict of suicide but said opportunities to help Mrs Norris had been missed by medical professionals. She said: 'Opportunities have been missed in respect of the initial referral to the hospital from the GPs' practice and the lack of adequate recording in the GPs' notes meant the evidence was insufficient to ascertain whether she stopped taking the drugs of her own accord or because she was advised to do so. 'There is also insufficient evidence to show whether restarting the Venlafaxine contributed to her death, or whether the Diazepam was prescribed for sickness or anxiety. 'However these were clinical decisions made by medical professionals and outside the remit of this inquest.' The Norris family's solicitors, Thompson Smith and Puxon, said an investigation into her death by the North Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust's mental health service had highlighted 'various areas of her care that were of concern'. It said Mrs Norris was left to seek help herself instead of being referred to experts by professionals. A similar probe by Colchester General Hospital found care may not have been provided to a standard which may have averted her death. Solicitor Naomi Eady, who represented Mr Norris at the inquest, said: 'It is of great concern to Joanne's family both investigating trusts are critical of the care she received on a number of different levels.' Mrs Norris, who suffered with severe anxiety from the age of 17, died after walking into the path of a speeding train at Witham station, Essex (pictured), on March 16 last year. A coroner recorded a verdict of suicide . The law firm added: 'Based on the evidence presented at the inquest the family will be pursuing a claim.' The inquest also heard how Mrs Norris' GP surgery, East Lynne Medical Centre in Clacton-on-Sea, had since changed its procedures to ensure that all expectant mothers are reviewed for mental health problems. The surgery is also in the process of making improvements to the way it shares information with other health services, the hearing was told. Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust has also installed a new computer system which lets GPs access patient records in a bid to reduce communication problems.","Pregnant Joanne Norris walked in front of speeding train at Witham, Essex .

"When it comes to living the high life those Real Housewives of Cheshire give even the Beckhams a run for their money. Swilling bubbly, driving around in Range Rovers and dining at the countries most expensive and exclusive restaurants - nothing is too good for the north west's most glamorous women. Now, in a new interview with the Daily Mirror, one star of the show, Dawn Ward, 41, has revealed the true extent of her lavish lifestyle. Scroll down for video . Dawn Ward, star of Real Housewives of Cheshire, has revealed her lavish lifestyle in a new interview saying she will only drink champagne and revealing she has a home cinema in her £15million home . The interview revealed that Dawn's ten-bedroom property includes a walk-in wardrobe that would fit two Range Rovers and she has huge kitchen - she is pictured here before changing her hair colour . From spending thousands of pounds on Champagne every year to having a home cinema and a home salon in her ten-bedroom, £15million mansion. Her daughters rooms include giant pink beds, one of which is shaped like a castle. The paper reports, during a tour of her sprawling Cheshire home, that Dawn's house also features a walk-in wardrobe, that would fit two Range Rovers, and a wine cellar filled with bottles of Bollinger and Laurent Perrier Rose Champagne. By her own admission Dawn will never touch sparking wine, sticking only to true Champagne. She said: 'I don't do Prosecco, babe, only the real stuff. I have a gag reflex if anyone tries to hand me a glass of that s***.' But successful business woman Dawn says she doesn't rely on her husband Ashley, an ex Manchester-City player to provide her endless supply of fizz.

"A convicted paedophile is reportedly working in a toy shop and a legal loophole in child protection laws means he is not breaking any rules. Stephen Maxwell Murray, who was convicted in 1991 in the Preston Magistrates Court on three counts of indecent assault and one of supplying liquor to a minor, has been working at the Melbourne store Animasia for at least four years, the Herald Sun reports. He was sentenced to six months in prison in 1991. He later worked in a comic store called The Crypt in Melbourne before he was allegedly sacked by owner Carmel Barbara due to public outcry about his hiring. Convicted paedophile Stephen Maxwell Murray has reportedly worked at the Animasia toy shop for four years . Ms Barbara continued to employ Murray after finding about his past conviction but said she wanted to ‘give him a chance,’ the Sunday Herald Sun reported in 2005. He now works at Animasia In Carlton, in Melbourne’s north, where he reportedly sells Japanese anime-inspired toys and runs model workshops in the school holidays. It is not illegal for Murray to work at the store because there are no laws that stop convicted paedophiles from working in shops with young customers. When Daily Mail Australia called Animasia, the owner of the store did not wish to comment and said Murray was not there. Victorian Attorney General Martin Pakula told Daily Mail Australia: ‘Like any parent I'm extremely concerned at the prospect of this happening.’ Mr Pakula has asked the Department of Justice and Regulation to review the definition of child related employment under the Sex Offenders Registration Act. He said the act ‘already includes commercial services and business activities, child photography, talent or beauty competitions - to ensure it covers relevant employment which involves contact with children that poses a threat to them.’ On a web forum called Gunpla Builders Australia a colleague of Murray's at the Animasia store posted in 2011: 'Animasia @ Grattan Street is finally online after 10,000 years of hiding under a rock! [sic].' It is not illegal for Murray to work at the store because there are no laws that stop convicted paedophiles from working in shops with young customers . The shop describes itself as an 'Anime speciality store that specialises in Gundams and Mecha' The worker added: 'Just FYI...Steven still won't participate with the internet revolution because he's still busy playing with his Godzilla and Mothra figures...LOL...However, rest assured that this thread has been officially endorsed and approved by Steven himself.' The shop describes itself as an 'Anime speciality store that specialises in Gundams and Mecha.' In Victoria, legislation called the Working With Children Check attempts to help protect children from physical and sexual harm by screening people’s criminal records and professional conduct. Those deemed to pose an ‘unjustifiable risk to children from working with or caring for them’ are banned from child-related work. The Working with Children Act 2005 defines who needs a check and it is an organisations responsibility to determine which of their workers need it and to ensure their checks are valid. Victorian Attorney General Martin Pakula told Daily Mail Australia: 'Like any parent I'm extremely concerned at the prospect of this happening' The Act defines ‘direct contact’ with a child as involving ‘physical contact; or face to face oral communication; or physically being within eyeshot.’ However, the WWC Check does not assess a person’s suitability to work with or care for children in a particular role. ‘It is the responsibility of organisations to assess if a worker is suitable to work with children and continue monitoring their behaviour around children,’ the Victorian government’s Working With Children website said. ‘Organisations should be vigilant at all times by doing thorough reference checks and establishing sound, ongoing supervision practices so that children are safe from harm.’ The Sex Offenders Registration Act - which captures all persons convicted of a relevant sexual offences against children - prohibits registrants from working in child related employment (whether employed, volunteering, an officer of a body corporate or a member of a partnership) but not retail stores that young people may visit. The penalty for a registrant working in such child related employment is two years imprisonment.

"A video has surfaced of the Muslim activist who described ISIS executioner Jihaji John as 'a beautiful man' calling for Jihad at an anti-US rally in London. Asim Qureshi urged protestors to 'support the jihad of our brothers and sisters' in Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine and Chechnya. Speaking through a microphone at the the pan-Islamic Hizb ut-Tahrir movement rally, human rights group CAGE's research director preached: 'When we see the example of our brothers and sisters fighting in Chechnya, Iraq, Palestine, Kashmir, Afghanistan, then we know where the example lies. Scroll down for video . Asim Qureshi urged protestors to 'support the jihad of our brothers and sisters' in Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine and Chechnya in a speech made outside the US Embassy in London . He urged supporters to help 'Jihad brothers and sisters' 'When we see Hezbollah defeating the armies of Israel, we know where the solution is and where the victory lies. 'We know that it is incumbent upon all of us, to support the Jihad of our brothers and sisters in these countries when they are facing the oppression of the West. 'Allahu Akhbar! Allahu Akhbar!' Qureshi - who in an outrageous 58 minute interview broadcast live on Thursday afternoon also described Mohammed Emwazi, the man revealed as the black robed ISIS executioner, as 'the most humble young person that I ever knew' - stands alone on a stage in the 54 second clip, shot at the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars in 2006.Qureshi  worked for CAGE at the time of his passionate speech, then known as CAGE Prisoners. The organisation claim to 'strive for a world free from oppression and injustice', 'working to empower communities impacted by the War on Terror.' Qureshi told Juliane Assange that he is in favour of both stoning and the death penalty . However, the video footage, posted on YouTube, now raises questions  about Qureshi, who alongside former control order detainee Cerie Bullivant tried to pin the blame for Mohammed Emwazi's radicalisation on the British Government. He also revealed that he'd been in regular contact with Emwazi before he left for Syria. And in a second video, in which Qureshi is quizzed by Juliane Assange on his view of Sharia law, in particularly stoning, he responded saying: 'I agree with Islamic concepts of how we practice our punishments.' Asked if he believes in the use of the death penalty, he added: 'From an Islamic perspective, yes. As long as all the due process elements are met.' In the wake of Emwazi's unmasking as the world's most wanted man, CAGE yesterday released a statement entitled 'Jihadi John: 'Radicalised' By Britain'. Qureshi during his hour long press conference, where he blamed Britain for radicalising 'Jihadi John' The release stated that Emwazi 'desperately wanted to use the system to change his situation, but the system ultimately rejected him,' a view later echoed on CAGE's press conference, which was broadcast live on both BBC and Sky News. Qureshi then used the statement to criticise the British security services, arguing that counter-terror measures turned young Muslims into extremists. Haras Rafiq, managing director of the anti-radicalisation think-tank the Quilliam Foundation, told Newsweek that CAGE's accusation that Britain was to blame for Emwazi's radicalisation was 'rubbish'. He said: 'It is not anybody else's fault. It's not the British or Kuwaitis fault. 'It is his fault and the people who radicalised him. He is a cold-hearted killer.'

"United Airlines has reportedly issued an urgent warning to its pilots after a series of cockpit blunders that could have put passengers in danger. The memo was said to have highlighted four 'major safety events,' including one where a pilot was forced to perform an emergency pull up maneuver to avoid crashing into the ground. The two page document entitled 'significant safety concerns,' was given to pilots last month, according to the Wall Street Journal. United Airlines has reportedly issued a stern warning to its pilots after a series of cockpit blunders . Another incident reportedly highlighted in the report involved an aircraft flying with fuel levels that fell below the mandatory requirements. The incidents, which all happened in the weeks leading up to the memo being produced, were categorized by the airline as 'major safety events and near-misses.' 'The common thread with all of these is that they are preventable,' the bulletin published by ABC News reads. 'We must ask ourselves, ''Do we have our priorities in line every time we put on our uniforms and strap into the airplane?'' It warned that a 'common thread' in the incidents was 'a lack of attention to discipline.'

"A former US defense contractor has pleaded guilty to sending sensitive information about US military jet programs to his native Iran in an effort to land a job. On Wednesday, 60-year-old Mozaffar Khazaee pleaded guilty in federal court to violating the Arms Export Control Act and faces up to 20 years in prison. Federal prosecutors say that Khazaee stole information about engines used in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and F-22 Raptor programs from three employers during his time as an engineer for U.S. defense contractors. Job: Former U.S. defense contractor, Mozaffar Khazaee, 60 (photographed), has pleaded guilty to sending sensitive information about U.S. military jet programs to his native Iran in an effort to land a job . One of the employers was Connecticut-based Pratt & Whitney. Khazaee allegedly tried to use that information to land a job with multiple universities in Iran from 2009 to 2013. In one email to a person in Iran, court records show that Khazaee wrote that he was taking a 'big risk' by sending the information. 'Again please after downloading these two Power Point files delete everything immediately,' Khazaee wrote. A search of Khazaee's computer revealed the documents he stole as well as applications to Iranian universities, FOX reports. Authorities found a cover letter on the man's computer which advertised skills the man learned while working on projects in the U.S. He wrote: 'I have learned some of the key technique[s] that could be transferred to our own industry and universities.' Khazaee also wrote that he was 'looking for an opportunity to work in Iran, and ...transferring my skill and knowledge to my nation.' Hubert Santos, Khazaee's lawyer, held that Khazaee was wrongly accused because he's an Iranian citizen. He said Khazaee was simply trying to impress a potential employer. Khazaee reportedly stole information about engines used in the F35 Joint Strike Fighter (photographed) and F-22 Raptor programs from three employers during his time as an engineer for U.S. defense contractors . F-22: Khazaee allegedly stole information about an engine used in the F-22 Raptor (photographed) program . In November 2013, a shipment prepared by Khazaee containing materials related to military jet engines was seized by customs agents in Long Beach, California. The shipment was headed to Iran. Khazaee was arrested at a New Jersey airport just months later in January 2014 while attempting to board a flight to Iran. Authorities reportedly found sensitive U.S. information in the man's luggage. Khazaee will be sentenced in May and, along with his potential sentence, faces a $1 million fine. Shortly after Khazaee's arrest, Pratt & Whitney officials issued a statement saying they are 'fully cooperating' with the government on the matter. U.S. Attorney Deirde Daly said in a statement that the U.S. will 'aggressively' investigate and hold accountable those who attempt to steal U.S. trade secrets and the illegal export of such information compromises 'national security.'","Mozaffar Khazaee, 60, pleaded guilty in federal court to violating the Arms Export Control Act and faces up to 20 years in prison .

"After years of quietly conceding defeat in our battle for wardrobe space, my husband Tom has finally snapped. Perhaps he’d overheard me grumble ‘I don’t have anything to wear!’ one too many times. Or he had stumbled across the summer dresses I’ve hung on his clothes rail to make way for my winter purchases. Determined to prove I have far more clothes than I need (or have time to wear), he decided to compile an inventory. Scroll down for video . Charlotte Kemp's (right) husband, Tom, (left) sorted through her huge collection of coats, dresses and trousers and put similar items into piles . While I was out one day last week, he sorted through my vast collection of coats, jackets, dresses, skirts and trousers. He’d taken on quite a task because my clothes have spread from my wardrobe and drawers into every inch of storage space, from the cloakroom to the attic. When I returned home, I was stunned to discover a long line of near identical winter boots in the hallway. On the bed were piles of identical T-shirts, a mountain of long-sleeved tops and jeans, at least 20 black dresses and two dozen jackets. In the spare room was a forgotten rail of party gowns — all worn just once or twice. I stood there in silence, taking it all in. There were no other words for it: I’d been wardrobe shamed. Not only had Tom made it glaringly obvious I have far too much of everything, he had cast a spotlight on something even more absurd: I buy the same thing over and over again. I have 32 white tops. Every year, I buy new ones without a thought for those I already own. Yes, there are subtle differences in cut and sleeve style, but seeing them en masse I could understand Tom’s complaint: ‘Isn’t a white top a white top?’ Charlotte (pictured) says Tom made it glaringly obvious she has too much of everything . Tom has just one suit, four pairs of jeans, three jumpers and a handful of shirts. So, why do I — and so many other women — have so many clothes? Just last month, Jennifer Lopez revealed her wardrobe, filled with hundreds of pairs of jeans. London Fashion Week is testament to the fact women are for ever searching for their next ‘look’. ‘Men and women have been socially conditioned to value clothes differently,’ says psychologist Kate Nightingale, of Style Psychology consultants. Men buy a new jumper to replace an old one but for women, clothes are more an emotional investment than necessity. Each purchase is tied up with self-esteem, body image and a desire to fit in or stand out. After Tom sorted her clothes, Charlotte (pictured) started to wonder how she had managed to buy similar items over and over again each year . We keep buying new things, says Nightingale, because we feel under pressure to constantly prove our allure. We may be subconsciously seeking approval from friends or have reached a crossroads in our lives and want to reflect that by changing our image. ‘Women are more likely to hold on to things with positive associations or which represent a life goal, such as a dress that doesn’t fit, but hopefully will one day.’ Seeing my wardrobe laid out before me was as much a trip down memory lane as a wake-up call. There was the floral maxi dress from our honeymoon in 1999, and the linen blazer and matching dress I wore on my first day at work. Though I have friends who shop as often as me, they clear out their wardrobes regularly. They’d never hold on to a moth-holed top because it reminds them of a holiday. Seeing her wardrobe laid out in front of her was like a trip down memory lane for Charlotte . I also need to stop buying clothes that don’t suit me. Of all the clothes Tom discovered, I wear only a few regularly. Women often mistakenly believe that the more clothes, shoes and accessories they have, the better dressed they’ll be, but the opposite is often true,’ says Debbie Roes, author of new book End Closet Chaos: Wardrobe Solutions From An Ex-Shopaholic (recoveringshopaholic.com). ‘Having a large wardrobe produces a false sense of security and abundance, but most women wear only 20 to 30 per cent of what they own.’ Debbie suggests we should do a wardrobe audit at least once a year. ‘Once you organise like with like, you can see where you are duplicating clothing and what, if any, real shopping needs you have,’ she says. ‘Try on everything and see if it fits, if you like it and if it works for your lifestyle. ‘An item could be in good condition, but may be dated or not suit your needs any more. ‘Our bodies also change, even if we remain the same weight and dress size.’ Tom (left) says he can't understand how someone could want so many similar items . In my defence, I have been through a decade of sartorial upheaval due to three pregnancies and a work/life shift that saw me swap full-time office work to be a freelancer and full-time mother. Now I need to be tough and get rid of the power skirt suits and party dresses I no longer need. So, I’ve started selling dresses I no longer wear on eBay. I’m also working through the identical white shirts, black trousers, skinny jeans and so on, with the aim of whittling each clothing group down to three. The rest must go. My best discovery is the website girlmeetsdress.com, which loans out party frocks for less than £40. So, on the rare occasions I do go out for the night, I can keep up with fashion trends without clogging up my wardrobe. TOM SAYS: Browsing a magazine last weekend, Charlotte spotted a £295 denim dress and announced her intention to buy it. I said surely it would be easier — and cheaper — to rummage through her wardrobe, where she’d find half-a-dozen identical denim dresses she already owns. Charlotte (pictured) says Tom's wardobe consists of just one suit, four pairs of jeans, three jumpers and a handful of shirts . But Charlotte told me they were all subtly, yet significantly, different. And I should actually be praising her for her frugality! By stockpiling all her purchases over the past two decades, she explained, she had worn them many times as they went in and out of fashion. But take one of her wardrobe staples — the grey woollen top. She has amassed so many I have no way of knowing whether she has splashed out on a new one (as I suspect) or it really is ‘just that old thing I’ve had for years’. I can’t understand why anyone would want so many similar items. Unlike my cricket jockstrap or skiing long johns, it’s not as if each performs a separate, essential function — they are so alike as to be indistinguishable. And so I took matters into my own hands and played a game of fashion snap, piling up matching garments and shoes while Charlotte was out. Charlotte has started selling the clothes she no longer wears on eBay and is using the website girlmeetsdress.com to rent dresses for a night instead of splashing out on a new outfit . It confirmed she owns far too many clothes that are very similar in style, colour and cut. But is that really surprising? We all have particular styles in which we think we look good. Every time I buy a winter jacket, I return thinking I am at the cutting edge of male fashion. But then Charlotte asks why it is identical to every jacket I’ve bought since 1992. But while that may be the case, for every jacket I buy, she buys five. And until now, she never throws anything out. I am not convinced her new efforts to streamline her wardrobe will come to much. She put a pair of unworn ankle boots for sale on eBay. Just a day later, the listing had disappeared. She explained that seeing the boots on the site made her realise how nice they were. They wouldn’t fetch more than £10, so by not selling them, she would not have to buy another pair. In other words, she was saving us money. It’s logic, Jim, but not as any man would know it.

'We only prosecute where efforts to persuade a business to improve have failed, and in this case we had absolutely no choice but to take court action. We now hope that in future standards will be significantly better and we will be monitoring the premises closely.' McKelvie said: 'We very much regret the situation we found ourselves in a year ago. However, we very quickly put things right and have moved on significantly further since then.

"For some, the idea of cutting Britain's ties with Europe is a way of returning the country to a simpler and more independent time. However, according new research, the British relationship with Europe dates back far further than was previously thought. Scientists have discovered that stone-age hunter gatherers in England were trading with continental wheat farmers 8,000 years ago - long before agriculture came to Britain. Researchers from the University of Warwick were able to isolate DNA from sediment core samples taken by divers from the sea floor below the cliffs on the north coast of the Isle of Wight, as shown in the picture above . They have found DNA for einkorn wheat buried within coastal sediments around the Isle of Wight off the south coast of England. A study of ancient human bones has revealed how Early Europeans had difficulties digesting milk around 5,000 years after the introduction of farming. It took at least that long for their genes to evolve until they were no longer intolerant to lactose, the natural sugar in mammalian milk, scientists suggests. Researchers looked at ancient DNA extracted from 13 individuals buried at archaeological sites in the Great Hungarian Plain - a region known to have been at the crossroads of cultural change in European prehistory. The scientists also found changes in prehistoric technology, such as the adoption of farming, were linked with a significant influx of new people. For instance, in the Neolithic or New Stone Age, ancient central Europeans had an appearance closer to Sardinians. In the Iron Age, there is another shift, with people coming into Central Europe from the East, such as the Caucasus or Asia. Researchers claim that tolerance to lactose only appeared in the Bronze Age, around 4,000 years after these people began dairying. Before then, most humans were lactose intolerant, and only later evolved the ability to break down this sugar in animal milk. However agriculture is not known to haarrived in Britain until around 6,000 years ago and scientists have found no evidence of wheat cultivation or pollen in the sediments. Instead they believe local hunter-gatherers bought the wheat by trading with European farmers from as far away as the south of France or the Balkans. This means that even 8,000 years ago there must have been trade routes winding their way across the European continent to Britain across an ancient land bridge. The scientists say that the discovery shows that Britain was no-where near as isolated or insular as had been originally thought. They say the findings may also force a complete rethink about how agriculture first arrived in Britain. Dr Robin Allaby, a plant geneticist at the University of Warwick who led the research, said: 'Eight thousand years ago the people of mainland Britain were leading a hunter-gatherer existence, whilst at the same time in southern Europeans farming was gradually spreading across Europe. 'Common throughout Neolithic Southern Europe, einkorn is not found elsewhere in Britain until 2,000 years after the samples found at Bouldnor Cliff. 'For the einkorn to have reached this site there needs to have been contact between Mesolithic Britons and Neolithic farmers far across Europe. 'The land bridges provide a plausible facilitation of this contact. 'As such, far from being insular, Mesolithic Britain was culturally and possibly physically connected to Europe.' The researchers suggest the wheat was brought to Britain by neolithic traders from southern Europe . Einkorn wheat, like that pictured above, is thought to be one of the first plants to have been domesticated . The researchers, whose findings are published in the journal Science, used new DNA extraction and analysis techniques to extract DNA from underwater sediments. They obtained sediment cores from Bouldnor Cliff on the north coast of the Isle of Wight, an area that had once been dry land before the end of the last ice age. Using the ancient sedimentary DNA, or sedaDNA, the scientists were able to reconstruct a picture of the plants and animals left behind there by the mesolithic people who inhabited the area. Among the native plants they found DNA sequences that matched those of near eastern strains of wheat. Professor Vince Gaffney, chair of landscape archaeology at the University of Bradford who was also involved in the study, said: 'We don't think it was grown here. We think it was traded across Europe. 'What that tells us is that these societies weren't isolated and they weren't simple. The scientists developed a new technique to extract DNA preserved in underwater sediments like above . 'Wheat, of course, is a signature for farming but this is 2,000 years before the onset of framing in Britain, and at this time the nearest farmers were either in the south of France or possibly as far away as the Balkans, thousands of miles across continental Europe. 'This tells us rather than the traditional model of farming arriving with colonists or some sort of invasion, the ideas and concepts of farming must have arrived several thousand years earlier.' Dr Greger Larson, a palaeogeneticist at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study, said the technology used to extract DNA in the study could revolutionise our understanding of history. He said: 'The ability to sequence DNA no longer associated with the macroscopic remains from which it originated presents a range of possibilities that begins with a refinement of accepted chronologies. 'The unexpectedly early appearance of wheat in Britain should force a rethinking of both the strength of the relationships between early farmers and hunter-gatherers, and the origins of settled agricultural communities in Europe.'","Archaeologists found wheat DNA in sediment off coast of the Isle of Wight .

"Food supplies to the UK could be blocked because defence cuts have left the nation with only 23 ships, it has been warned. Vital shipping lanes around the world are being left vulnerable, according to Tory MP James Arbuthnot, chairman of the defence select committee. The Royal Navy fleet is now just a quarter of the size it was when it defended the Falklands and has shrunk dramatically since the Second World War. Britain now has only 23 warships, down from 73 at the time of the 1982 Falklands War . Mr Arbuthnot warned the UK now stockpiles almost no food or fuel, instead becoming dependent on regular supplies from overseas. He warns that the country’s enemies could exploit the vulnerability to wreak havoc. ‘If someone wanted to close the Suez Canal, it would be really quite easy to do,’ he told The Sun. ‘I don't know how many days food or fuel we have but we will certainly find the price of everything going up quickly. If I wished ill to this country, it is what I would do.’ Tory MP James Arbuthnot, chairman of the defence select committee, warned of the impact of cuts to the navy . Mr Arbuthnot is standing down at the next election, and hopes to land a job in the defence industry. He is quitting the select committee a year earlier, to prepare for a career outside politics. The Royal Navy now has 23 battleships, including four assault ships, 6 type-45 destroyers and 13 type-23 frigates. The figure is well down on the 73 available to launch the operation to defend the Falklands in 1982. At the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Britain had 272 ships, almost double the 150 on deployed during the First World War. Mr Arbuthnot was a defence minister in John Major’s government, when the ‘idea of going below 50 serious ships was a major concern’, he said. While modern warships are faster and better equipped than earlier fleets, there are fears that the UK is no unable to protect itself and its supply routes. Mr Arbuthnot added: ‘Peace can turn to war with astonishing rapidity, as we saw in the annexation of Crimea. ‘If you have reduced your capability, then sooner or later you face the consequences. ‘Goods, food, fuel come to us by sea, much of it through the Suez Canal. We need to be able to protect our supply lines. ‘We have abolished all the warehouses we used to have and turned them into shi-shi flats. ‘And we have got no stocks of food or fuel or essential goods to last us for any reasonable length of time.’ Britain now has 23 ships, including HMS Westminster (left) and HMS Albion . The Iranian navy frigate IS Alvand passes through the Suez canal at Ismailia in 2011 . A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: ‘Tough decisions had to be taken to deal with the deficit in the Defence budget, but at 2.4 per cent of GDP this year, planned UK spending remains well above the NATO target of 2 per cent. ‘The Royal Navy’s ability to project power and influence around the globe is evident with deployments of vessels to assist in the search for the missing Malaysian airliner; a Helicopter Carrier and Destroyer following the typhoon in the Philippines; while taking part in operations in counter-piracy, counter-narcotics and safeguarding Chemical Weapons being removed from Syria. ‘All this is being carried out while maintaining a large Naval presence in the Gulf, while naval vessels are also defending the Falkland Islands and maintaining our continuous-at-sea deterrent. ‘Construction of the first new Aircraft Carrier, the largest ship the Royal Navy has ever operated, is almost complete and the Navy will also operate state-of-the-art Type 45 Destroyers, new Type-26 Frigates, and seven new Astute Class submarines.’","James Arbuthnot warns Royal Navy cannot protect vital supply lanes .

"Truck driver Jose Alejandro Sanchez-Ramirez was arrested on suspicion of leaving the scene of an accident with injuries and is expected to be arraigned on Thursday afternoon . A commuter train's on-board camera captured a fiery crash with a pickup truck abandoned by its driver on Tuesday morning, and federal investigators say the video could give a big boost to the search for a cause. The truck driver, Jose Alejandro Sanchez-Ramirez, a 54-year-old from Yuma, Arizona, was arrested on suspicion of leaving the scene of an accident with injuries and is expected to be arraigned on Thursday afternoon. The video, taken from the outward-facing camera on the front car of the Metrolink train bound for Los Angeles, was sent back to the Washington home of the National Transportation Safety Board for analysis, board member Robert Sumwalt said. Sumwalt also said that while the truck wasn't stuck in the way that vehicles sometimes get trapped between railroad crossing safety arms, investigators have not ruled out that the truck was somehow stranded and will determine why it traveled 80 feet down the tracks and remained there with its parking brake engaged. 'I don't think anybody would put a car or truck on ... railroad tracks and not try to get it off if there's an approaching train,' Sumwalt said. The crash in Oxnard, about 45 miles (70 km) northwest of Los Angeles, flipped over three double-decker Metrolink rail cars and derailed two others. It tore apart the Ford pickup truck Sanchez-Ramirez drove onto the tracks after making a wrong turn before dawn. Thirty people were injured in the Tuesday pre-dawn crash and three remain in critical condition including the train operator who is on a ventilator. Scroll down for video . Three cars of the Southern California Metrolink commuter train derailed and tumbled onto their sides after the collision on tracks in Ventura County on Tuesday morning . Tuesday morning's Metrolink train crash with a pickup truck was captured by on-board cameras and federal investigators say the video could give a big boost to their search for a cause for the incident . Sanchez-Ramirez was found walking and 'in distress' more than a mile (1.5 km) from the crash site in Oxnard on Tuesday and was later taken into custody on suspicion of felony hit-and-run, police said. Attorney Ron Bamieh told reporters that the crash was an accident and his client left the scene trying to look for help before eventually finding police. 'The reality is he basically freaked out trying to help people,' Bamieh said. 'Did he do everything like James Bond? No, he did the best he could.' He said Ramirez made repeated attempts to get the vehicle off the rails and then ran for his life as the train approached. Sanchez-Ramirez accidentally drove onto the tracks and made the situation worse by continuing forward in an attempt to get enough speed to get his wide pickup over the rails, Bamieh said. When that effort failed, he tried to push the truck and then fled before the impact. 'He hits his high beams trying to do something. He's screaming. He realizes, 'I can't do anything,' and then he tries to run so he doesn't get killed,' Bamieh said. 'He saw the impact, yes. It was a huge explosion.' A firefighter crawls out of a passenger train car at the scene of a Metrolink accident  in Oxnard, California. Three remain in a critical condition including the train operator who is on a ventilator. Police arrested Ramirez on a charge of leaving the scene of an accident with injuries, but Bamieh said he went for help in Oxnard, about 65 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles . Police said Ramirez was found 45 minutes after the crash 1.6 miles away, though Bamieh said he was only a half-mile away and that he has phone records that show he spoke with police much sooner. 'When someone goes through a huge trauma like that and not only thinking they almost died, but they think other people are dead and you don't know what to do and you're confused ... what is a normal reaction to such an event?' Bamieh said. Police said Ramirez did not call 911 and made no immediate effort to call for help. But Bamieh said Ramirez, who doesn't speak English well, tried to get help from a passerby, tried calling his employer and eventually reached his son to help him speak with police. The Los Angeles Times reported on Wednesday that Sanchez-Ramirez had a history of vehicle infractions in Arizona, including pleading guilty in 1998 to violations including driving with a blood alcohol content above the state's legal limit. Bamieh confirmed his client was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol in 1998 but said there was no indication he was intoxicated at the time of Tuesday's rail crash. Flames engulfed the driver's Ford F-450 pickup, but investigators said the engine was intact and may offer clues about what happened . Lives were likely saved by passenger cars designed to absorb a crash that were purchased after a deadly collision a decade ago, Metrolink officials said . Passenger Joel Bingham said many of those aboard the train on Tuesday were asleep and shocked awake when the loud boom first happened. 'It seemed like an eternity while we were flying around the train. Everything was flying,' Bingham said. 'A brush of death definitely came over me.' Lives were likely saved by passenger cars designed to absorb a crash that were purchased after a deadly collision a decade ago, Metrolink officials said. The four passenger cars remained largely intact, as did the locomotive. The NTSB planned to examine the effectiveness of those cars, Sumwalt said. The train, the first of the morning on the Ventura route, had just left its second stop of Oxnard on its way to downtown Los Angeles when it struck the truck around 5:45 a.m. The engineer saw the abandoned vehicle and hit the brakes, but there wasn't enough time to stop, Oxnard Fire Battalion Chief Sergio Martinez said. The crossing has been the scene of many crashes over the years. After one killed 11 people and injured 180 others in Glendale in 2005, Metrolink invested heavily in passenger cars with collapsible bumpers and other features to absorb impact. Metrolink spokesman Jeff Lustgarten said the Oxnard crash showed the technology worked. 'Safe to say it would have been much worse without it,' he said. Tuesday's crash happened on the same line as Metrolink's worst disaster, which left 25 people dead on Sept. 12, 2008. A commuter train engineer was texting and ran a red light, striking a Union Pacific freight train head-on in the San Fernando Valley community of Chatsworth.

"President Obama (above) no longer has a viable national security strategy due to funding and troop cuts, a new report by The Heritage Foundation claims . The US military has become so depleted by cuts that it has been left only 'marginally able' to defend the nation. Decreases in the number of soldiers and naval ships have led to armed forces falling short of President Obama's national security strategy,  a report by The Heritage Foundation claimed. Obama's aim was to ensure that the country could still fight two major conflicts at once. But the Index of US Military Strength report, released by the think tank on Tuesday, said that with current  funding this would be problematic. The report said: 'The consistent decline in funding and the consequent shrinking of the US Army are putting it under significant pressure. 'The cumulative effect of such factors has resulted in a US military that is marginally able to meet the demands of defending America's vital national interests.' The Quadrennial Defense Review announced last year that the Army would be cut from 570,000 soldiers to 440,000 - the fewest since World War II. The Army historically commits 21 brigade combat teams to one war but would struggle to do this and leave reserves if there were two simultaneous conflicts, the report said. It added that the Navy would need another 62 ships to be able to carry out two large campaigns. However the Air Force’s fleet  is judged 'strong'. Dakota Wood, a Heritage analyst and former Marine Corps officer, said: 'The US military itself is ageing. It's shrinking in size.

Randy Forbes, member of the House Armed Services Committee, said  the report's findings were stark. He said: 'It paints a stark picture of shortfalls in capability, capacity and readiness across the force, and illustrates the damage done by years of irresponsible budget cuts. 'If you listen to the Army, they will give testimony that they can no longer guarantee. You talk about two wars - they testified they can't guarantee that we could win one war.

"Ebola tests on two children at a hospital in Melbourne have come back negative for the virus. Victoria's deputy chief health officer Michael Ackland said the girls, aged four and eight, who were admitted to Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital on Thursday, are being treated for a respiratory illness. Despite being cleared for now, the girls will again be tested in 72 hours to rule out the possibility of having contracted the Ebola virus, something Professor Ackland said was a normal process. The girls returned home to Melbourne overnight with their parents and another sibling following an extended trip to Guinea. Scroll down for video . Ebola tests on two girls, aged four and eight, who were admitted to Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital on Thursday, have returned as negative . Two children under the age of 10 were tested for the deadly Ebola virus at The Royal Children's Hospital . Other family members remain well. 'Routine screening of returning travellers from Ebola-affected countries in west Africa identified that the girls had elevated temperatures,' Prof Ackland said in a statement on Thursday. In accordance with universal infection control procedures, they were taken to Royal Children's Hospital to be assessed for a range of infections including Ebola. He says it's unlikely other travellers on the plane from Abu Dhabi or others who had contact with the girls inside the airport will fall unwell. Earlier on Thursday, a spokesperson for The Royal Children's Hospital told Daily Mail Australia that the patients are being kept in isolation. Medical staff are battling against Ebola in West Africa . 'Two patients have been isolated at The Royal Children's Hospital following admission this morning with an infectious disease. The children, aged under 10, are being tested for a range of infectious diseases, including the ebola virus,' the spokesperson said. 'Specialist medical staff are caring for the patients, using the procedures and equipment in which they have been trained. The safety of staff and the community is paramount. 'Results of the diagnostic testing will be known within a few hours. The hospital is unable to provide further information about the patients or their conditions until the test results are known.' The ABC reports the children were suffering 'elevated temperatures' when they touched down at Melbourne Airport from an Ebola-affected country on Wednesday night. Worried passengers on Etihad flight EY460 can contact 1800 356 061 and talk to medical staff about the signs and symptoms of Ebola. In October, Australia prompted outrage by becoming the first Western country to ban visitors from Ebola-hit areas of Africa, amid warnings the restrictions could make it harder to fight the deadly disease. Australia prompted outrage by becoming the first Western country to ban visitors from Ebola-hit areas of Africa . The outbreak has become the deadliest occurrence of the disease since its discovery in 1976 . In a dramatic move, the government said it would refuse entry to anyone travelling from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leona - the countries most severely hit by the epidemic - despite there being no known cases of the virus in Australia. But a Sierra Leone official condemned the ban, describing it as 'counter-productive' and 'too draconian'. Liberia's president urged Australia to reconsider its decision, while UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon warned travel restrictions could seriously hamper efforts to beat Ebola. There have been numerous Ebola scares in Australia since the outbreak in West Africa was first reported in March 2014. The outbreak has become the deadliest occurrence of the disease since its discovery in 1976. Sue Ellen Kovack volunteered as a nurse treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone and was tested for the disease when she returned to Australia . In October last year, a volunteer nurse was monitored inside a Queensland hospital for Ebola. Her test results returned as negative, a Queensland Health official has confirmed. Sue Ellen Kovack was tested for the deadly virus on her return from Sierra Leone where she was volunteering with the Red Cross in the fight against Ebola. There were fears the 57-year-old, from Cairns, was suffering from the illness she was helping to treat after she reported feeling a fever. Ms Kovack was put under observation and quarantined at Cairns Hospital.","The children were admitted to the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne .

"Russia has announced plans to send manned flights to the moon by 2030, as it pledges to keep the International Space Station in orbit for nine more years. Roscosmos, Russia's space agency, said it would launch the manned missions after reviving its lunar programme with unmanned spacecraft. The news comes three years after a leaked document from the federal agency suggested a manned mission to the moon was in the pipeline. Russia has announced plans to send manned flights to the moon by 2030, as it pledges to keep the International Space Station (pictured) in orbit for nine more years . It was the first time Moscow had set a deadline for the space plans, hoping to recapture the early glory of the first space race, when they beat the U.S. at getting a man to orbit the earth. Barack Obama previously wanted to get Americans onto Mars by 2030. A Roscosmos spokesman said: 'Close to 2030, the plan is to move over to manned flights to the Moon.' The agency also announced that it would continue to work with Nasa on the ISS until 2024, when it hopes to build its own orbital station. It says the station would aim to provide Russia 'with guaranteed access to the cosmos'. Russian government officials had indicated last year that they may end funding of the ISS in 2020, amid strained relations between the the U.S and Russia over the Ukraine sanctions row. Russia's Yuri Gagarin (pictured) was the first man in space in 1961 and Neil Armstrong of the U.S. was the first man on the Moon in 1969 . Extensive cooperation in space between Washington and Moscow came under renewed pressure after the U.S banned high-tech exports to Russia. But that proposal appears to have been rejected in favour of keeping it going for another four years, as Nasa had suggested. The space industry has been the root of fierce competition between Russia and the U.S dating back to the Cold War. The U.S and the Soviet Union were locked in the so-called 'space race' for decades. Russia's Yuri Gagarin was the first man in space in 1961 and Neil Armstrong of the United States was the first man on the Moon in 1969. But with the Cold War over, competition gave way to cooperation. Russia's subsequently deorbited its own Mir space station in 2001 as Moscow sought to concentrate its resources on the ISS.","Roscosmos, Russia's space agency, is set to revive its lunar programme .

"A video has surfaced of the Muslim activist who described ISIS executioner Jihadi John as 'a beautiful man' supporting Jihad at an anti-US rally in London. Asim Qureshi, leader of campaign group CAGE, was filmed urging protesters to 'support the jihad of our brothers and sisters' in Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine and Chechnya. Yesterday, Qureshi, who helped to name ISIS militant Jihadi John as west London student Mohammed Emwazi, caused outrage by saying the murderer was 'beautiful' adding that he 'wouldn't hurt a fly'. But Reg Henning, brother of British aid worker Alan Henning who died at Jihadi John's hands, hit back and said: 'If he's a ""beautiful, kind man"", why is he killing innocent civilians? 'He's a monster. Everyone should be doing everything they can to capture him and bring him to justice - not stick up for him like he's been hard done by.' Scroll down for video . Asim Qureshi, leader of campaign group CAGE, is pictured at a London rally at the height of the Iraq war in 2006 calling for protesters to 'support the jihad of our brothers and sisters' Earlier today Qureshi caused outrage after calling ISIS militant Jihadi John, named today as Mohammed Emwazi, 'beautiful' and saying he 'wouldn't hurt a fly' Murdered: Aid worker Alan Henning was killed by Jihadi John. His brother Reg described the terrorist as 'a monster' Speaking while close to tears at a press conference this afternoon, he blamed MI5 for radicalising Emwazi, saying  the security services harassed him and alienated him. In the earlier footage, Qureshi can be seen speaking through a microphone at the pan-Islamic Hizb ut-Tahrir movement rally. He says: 'When we see the example of our brothers and sisters fighting in Chechnya, Iraq, Palestine, Kashmir, Afghanistan, then we know where the example lies. 'When we see Hezbollah defeating the armies of Israel, we know where the solution is and where the victory lies. 'We know that it is incumbent upon all of us, to support the Jihad of our brothers and sisters in these countries when they are facing the oppression of the West. 'Allahu Akhbar! Allahu Akhbar! (God is great, God is great!)' Defence: Asim Qureshi, research director at the campaign group CAGE, described Mohammed Emwazi, who is believed to be Jihadi John, as 'extremely kind' and blamed MI5 for his radicalisation . Qureshi  stands alone on a stage in the 54 second clip, shot at the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars in 2006. Qureshi worked for CAGE at the time of his passionate speech, then known as CAGE Prisoners. The organisation claims to 'strive for a world free from oppression and injustice', 'working to empower communities impacted by the War on Terror.' However, the video footage, posted on YouTube, now raises questions about Qureshi, who alongside former control order detainee Cerie Bullivant tried to pin the blame for Mohammed Emwazi's radicalisation on the British Government. Earlier today Qureshi was branded an ISIS sympathiser as he appeared to launch a defence of Emwazi and his barbaric crimes. He said: 'When are we going to finally learn that when we treat people as if they're outsiders, they are going to feel like outsiders and they will look for belonging elsewhere.' Unmasked: ISIS executioner 'Jihadi John' has been identified as Mohammed Emwazi from west London . He also revealed that he'd been in regular contact with Emwazi before he left for Syria. And in a second video, in which Qureshi is quizzed by Julian Assange on his view of Sharia law, in particular stoning, he said: 'I agree with Islamic concepts of how we practice our punishments.' Asked if he believes in the use of the death penalty, he added: 'From an Islamic perspective, yes. As long as all the due process elements are met.' In the wake of Emwazi's unmasking as the world's most wanted man, CAGE yesterday released a statement entitled 'Jihadi John: 'Radicalised' By Britain'. A Cage spokesman walked off a Sky News interview live on air after being asked if he condemned the actions of Jihadi John. Cerie Bullivant accused interviewer Kay Burley of asking him 'inherently xenophobic' questions, to which she replied: ‘Nonsense, get over yourself.’ Removing his earpiece: Cage spokesman Cerie Bullivant walked off a live Sky News interview . Off he goes: Mr Bullivant accused Kay Burley of asking him 'inherently xenophobic' questions . He claimed that the security services in Britain have ‘time and again harassed people and pushed them, and that has played a part in the radicalisation of this man’. Mr Bullivant - who spent two years on a control order designed for terrorist suspects, but was an innocent man - was then asked by Burley: ‘Do you condemn his actions’ But he replied, before walking off: ‘I've already said… I'm sorry, I'm not answering that question, that's a ridiculous question, I’ve already gone through this and dealt with it.’ After he walked off screen, Burley paused before looking at the camera and smiling. The release stated that Emwazi 'desperately wanted to use the system to change his situation, but the system ultimately rejected him,' a view later echoed on CAGE's press conference, which was broadcast live on both BBC and Sky News. Qureshi then used the statement to criticise the British security services, arguing that counter-terror measures turned young Muslims into extremists. Haras Rafiq, managing director of the anti-radicalisation think-tank the Quilliam Foundation, told Newsweek that CAGE's accusation that Britain was to blame for Emwazi's radicalisation was 'rubbish'. He said: 'It is not anybody else's fault. It's not the British or Kuwaitis fault. It is his fault and the people who radicalised him. He is a cold-hearted killer.' 'If you look at [CAGE's] raison d'être, they are there to defend these kind of people. There has been evidence that these guys are sympathetic to this type of ideology.' Qureshi criticised the British security services, arguing that counter-terror measures turned young Muslims into extremists . In posts made on Twitter, Quilliam co-founder and chairman Maajid Nawaz, also blasted CAGE, hinting that Qureshi was a supporter of controversial speaker, Haitham Haddad. Emails released by CAGE today revealed how  MI5 repeatedly tried to recruit Mohammed Emwazi as an informant and  put him on a terror watchlist to stop him leaving Britain. Emwazi is believed to have become known to the security services in 2009 when he was accused of trying to fight with Somali terror group Al-Shabaab in east Africa. The British citizen, who was born in Kuwait and moved to the UK aged six, flew to Tanzania with two friends after he graduated from the University of Westminster claiming he was going on safari. But he was arrested as soon as he touched down in capital Dar es Salaam and deported by Tanzanian's officials. He flew back to Britain via Amsterdam and told a friend MI5 were waiting for him at Schiphol Airport and tried to recruit him to share information on extremists, Emwazi told a confidant. Emwazi claimed that an MI5 agent called Nick accused him of trying to go to Somalia to fight for Al Shabaab and said:  'Listen Mohammed: You've got the whole world in front of you; you're 21 years old; you just finished Uni – why don't you work for us?'. The Jihadi John suspect turned down the offer and claims he was told: 'You're going to have a lot of trouble ...you're going to be known...you're going to be followed...life will be harder for you.' Emwazi claimed in emails to Qureshi that he was repeatedly approached by the security services over the course of the following year but he said he refused to co-operate and denied he had any links to terrorism. 1988: Born in Kuwait . c1994: Moved to Britain aged six, where he grew up in Queen's Park, west London . 2009: Graduated from University of Westminster in computer programming . May 2009: Flies to Tanzania for 'planned safari' but is detained by police in Dar es Salaam. Eventually deported but he is allegedly accused by MI5 of trying to reach Somalia, en route in Amsterdam . Autumn 2009: Returns to Britain but soon moves back to Kuwait and finds work at a computer firm . June 2010: Counter-terrorism police detain him upon his return to London to finalise his wedding plans, and he is not allowed to return . 2012: Emwazi heads for Syria and joins ISIS . Hostages who have survived being held by ISIS in Syria and Iraq have said that Jihadi John is a man 'obsessed' with Somalia and would make them watch Al-Shabaab videos while in captivity. In June 2010 counter-terrorism officers, linked to the security services and Scotland Yard, allegedly arrested him as he tried to fly to Kuwait. He was fingerprinted and searched, it was said, and put on a terror watchlist preventing him from leaving Britain. In an email to Mr Qureshi he said: 'I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London. A person imprisoned & controlled by security service men, stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace & country, Kuwait'. Another friend said that Emwazi later tried to travel to Saudi Arabia to teach English in 2012 but again stopped from leaving. He was 'desperate' to leave Britain and 'was ready to exhaust every single kind of avenue within the machinery of the state to bring a change for his personal situation', Mr Qureshi said. Mr Qureshi said he last heard from him that year and said the Jihadi John supect believed 'actions were taken to criminalize him and he had no way to do something against these actions'. Soon afterwards he vanished and is believed to have travelled to Syria, where he may now be ISIS' figurehead. On the scene: Police officers near the property where Emwazi once lived in Queen's Park, west London . If Emwazi's account of his contact with MI5 is accurate, his case has parallels with that of Lee Rigby's murderer Michael Adebolajo, who was jailed for life in 2013. His trial heard that just three months before the appalling murder in Woolwich, MI5 was trying to recruit Michael Adebolajo as an informant. He had been on their radar for ten years and in 2010 was even arrested with fellow Al Qaeda followers in Kenya. Adebolajo complained of being 'harassed' by MI5 agents before the killing and it later it emerged that they had failed to watch him carefully enough before he murdered Drummer Rigby with the help of his friend Michael Adebowale.

"It seems that humans aren't the only ones who need forgiveness. Bizarre footage has surfaced of a fugitive pig grovelling in front of a temple in Wenzhou, Zhejiang province on Tuesday. Pictures and video of the bowing boar, which had escaped from a nearby farm, have spread like wildfire on Chinese social media, sparking a flurry of debates over what the animal was doing, reports Sina. Scroll down for video . A large pig was found this week kneeling on its forelimbs at a temple in Tantou village, eastern China . Images of the bowing boar have spread like wildfire on social media, sparking a flurry heated debates on exactly what the animal was doing . Footage  shows the animal kneeling on its forelimbs encircled by worshippers, as a Buddhist ceremony takes place inside the temple. The saintly swine reportedly stayed put for hours, and only left the scene after a group of monks emerged from inside and chanted a Buddhist scripture towards it. Discussions on the social media site WeiBo have seen some users propose the animal was seeking a pilgrimage for a Chinese New Year's blessing. Others deduced the holy hog was merely seeking food or resting after an act of physical exertion. Another web user offered a more scientific explanation: the pig was suffering from a disease concerning a deficiency in vitamin E, which can lead to an inability to stand up on all fours and kneel on one's front legs. It was later revealed the 150kg pig has escaped from a nearby farm with two other cohorts in search of food . Meanwhile, the owner of the pig later revealed it had escaped his hog pen on the morning on February 22, apparently in search of food. Sadly, Mr Huang-who had raised the animal up to over 150 kilograms-ordered for the animal to be slaughtered upon being recaptured. In a cruel twist of fate, Mr Huang Wenzhou Metropolis Daily he only learned of its internet stardom after the pig had been butchered, and he would not have done so otherwise. 'How bizarre! I've been raising pigs for so many years but I've never seen anything like this. I really shouldn't have killed it!' he said. Sadly, the owner of the pig ordered it to be butchered when it was recaptured, only learning of its internet stardom when it was too late. He told local media: 'I really shouldn't have killed it!' Huang was astonished by the viral images, and vowed that none of his pigs have been diagnosed with any diseases. 'This is really awkward. If the pigs were scared, they should have ran away instead of making that strange posture and let everyone watch.' Over three thousand people reportedly attended the temple for the final day of confessions on Buddha repentance day. It would seem this pitiful pig's prayers were left unanswered.","The 150kg pig had reportedly escaped from a local farm in search of food .

"Sir Cliff Richard performed at a special charity event in Barbados over the weekend with his lifelong friend John McElynn. Sir Cliff played a set in front of fans on the Caribbean island in aid of severely brain damaged children for St Michael's parish on Saturday night. The 74-year-old singer, who has denied allegations that he targeted a young boy in the 1980s said: 'I have never, in my life, assaulted anyone.' Scroll down for video . Sir Cliff Richard, pictured, played a charity concert on the Caribbean island of Barbados last weekend . Sir Cliff, pictured, has strenuously denied the allegations of assault dating back to the 1980s . Two new alleged victims have come forward since the singer’s £3million Berkshire home was raided last August by detectives investigating a historic allegation of sexual assault on a teenage boy under 16 at a Christian rally in 1985. South Yorkshire Police has set up a dedicated team of officers, under the name Operation Kaddie, to investigate allegations that three boys were molested. Detectives have already taken statements from a number of witnesses as the probe widens. Prosecutors are also liaising with police to give ‘investigative advice’ on how to take the investigation forward after officers received a significant number of new lines of inquiry. So far, three people have come forward and made allegations against the veteran performer who has strenuously denied any impropriety. Sir Cliff, pictured, attended this event with his lifelong friend John McElynn in St Michael's parish . David Crompton, South Yorkshire Police chief constable wrote to Keith Vaz MP, outlining the current state of the investigation, which has 'increased significantly in size', involving 'more than one allegation'. Mr Vaz, who is chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, published the letter from Mr Crompton. According to the document: 'South Yorkshire Police detectives are in very regular contact with Sir Cliff Richard’s lawyers. Typically this involves a verbal update about once a fortnight. ‘We have not written directly to Sir Cliff Richard. It is the responsibility of his lawyers to ensure he is fully briefed on the conversations which have taken place with investigators. ‘This is an investigation which has increased significantly in size since its inception. Sir Cliff Richard’s lawyers are aware that there is more than one allegation.’ Sir Cliff, second left, earlier said he had 'no idea where these absurd and untrue allegations come from' The singer happily posed with fans during the charity event on the Caribbean island on Saturday night . In his statement, Sir Cliff, right, said he would like to 'especially thank everyone' who has supported him . However, the singer, whose house was raided while he was on holiday in Portugal, released a statement in response. He said: 'I have no idea where these absurd and untrue allegations come from. The police have not disclosed details to me. ‘I have never, in my life, assaulted anyone and I remain confident that the truth will prevail. I have cooperated fully with the police, and will, of course, continue to do so. ‘Beyond stating that the allegations are completely false, it would not be appropriate for me to say anything further until the investigation has concluded, which I hope will be very soon. ‘In the meantime, I would, again, like to thank everyone for supporting me through this unbelievably difficult period.’ The allegations against Sir Cliff, pictured, surfaced when a man in his 40s approached police last year . The man claimed Sir Cliff, pictured, sexually assaulted him at a Christian rally in Sheffield in the 1980s . Metropolitan police detectives passed on the report about Sir Cliff, right, to South Yorkshire Police . The police investigation first began last year when a man, now in his 40s, came forward to claim Sir Cliff sexually assaulted him at a rally in Sheffield held by American evangelist Billy Graham. He initially contacted Operation Yewtree, the Scotland Yard investigation set up in October 2012 to examine claims against Savile and other celebrities. The report was passed to South Yorkshire Police last year. Police have already been heavily criticised over the way the case against the singer has unfolded. The raid was recorded live by a BBC helicopter circling overhead capturing officers wearing forensic gloves searching through drawers after a reporter contacted the force claiming they had information about the investigation. South Yorkshire Police Chief Constable David Crompton, pictured wrote to Keith Vaz concerning Sir Cliff .

"A 911 dispatcher who told a 13-year-old girl to 'stop whining' as her father lay dying in a hit-and-run crash on a Maryland highway has been fired. Anne Arundel County Fire Department spokesman Capt. Russ Davies said the dispatcher no longer works for the department. The dispatcher's name was not released. The February 1 incident triggered an investigation after the dispatcher told the girl to stop whining. The 911 call came in after a car hit 38-year-old Rick Warrick of Washington and his fiancée as they changed a tire along the Baltimore-Washington Parkway. Scroll down for video . Killed: Rick Warrick, 38, died after he and his fiancee were struck by a hit-and-run driver as they changed a tire on the hard shoulder of a Maryland highway February 1. His two children witnessed the tragedy . Warrick and his fiancée, Julia Pearce, 28, had been heading to dinner in Anne Arundel County, Maryland with Warrick's two children. As the couple changed the tire on the hard shoulder, the youngsters watched in horror as a vehicle struck them and then sped away. The teenage girl frantically called 911 for help. 'Can y'all please hurry up!' the teen begs the male operator in a recording of the call, NBC Washington reported. The operator responds: 'Ma'am, stop yelling, I need a location.' When the girl tells him that they're on I-295, he tells her 'that's a pretty long road'. Again, she urgently tells him that two people were struck. 'OK, let's stop whining. OK, let's stop whining. It's hard to understand you... two people were struck, correct?' the operator says on the recording. When she tells him that the couple are lying on the ground not moving, he asks to talk to someone else - but she tells him that he'll be able to understand her little brother even less. Eventually emergency responders reached the couple. Scene: Warrick had managed to switch the front tire on the front of his car when he was hit February 1. When his daughter called 911 to get help, the male operator told her to stop whining . Warrick, a car salesman from Washington D.C., died at the scene. His fiancee suffered two broken legs, a broken pelvis and a fractured skull and was taken to Baltimore's Shock Trauma Center for treatment. She was seriously injured, though her injuries were not life-threatening. When quizzed by NBC Washington over the incident, Davies admitted that the operator had not used the best choice of words and should respond differently in the future. 'However, what he was attempting to do was to get her attention, to start ascertaining information from her,' Davis said. 'It was pretty clear at that point they didn't know where they were.' Police and family members have pleaded for the driver who hit the couple to come forward. Sgt. Lelani Woods told WJLA that the couple were completely on the shoulder of the roadway when they were hit. The car then fled. The other vehicle has been recovered, and there is a person of interest, Woods told WBAL-TV last week. Pearce said she did not get a good look at the car. 'Truly, if you have a child, or any children, how would you feel if someone just ran over your child, killed your child, and just kept going?' said Charmaine Ferrell-Anthony, Warrick's mother. 'A hit and run, there's no excuse for it, when you can just stop right there.' She added: 'I think the right thing will be to do just to turn yourself in. Accidents happen and we understand. It was a tragic accident.' Anyone with information is urged to call 202-610-8737.

"A homeless man has been charged with relieving himself on $1,000 worth of library books. Benjamin Wilson is alleged to have been watched by a patron as he urinated on a stack of titles in a Florida library. The 24-year-old entered Tavares Public Library at the weekend with the intention of using its free WiFi to download apps on to his tablet. Benjamin Wilson, 24, is accused of urinating on books in Tavares Public Library, Florida . Staff quickly adjudged him to be behaving in an off manner, later telling police that they believed him to be either drunk or on drugs. They claimed his eyes weren't reacting to changes in light and his speech was severely slurred. Wilson was also said to have been 'having trouble standing and making a complete thought'. He fell asleep on a chair inside the library, but a short time later collapsed over. Once back on his feet, witnesses claim he stumbled around before coming to a halt. Staff were then left dumbfounded when one patron told them he'd witnessed Wilson soil a collection of books. Deputies from Lake County attended and found the accused  slurring and unable to stand up without support. He was searched and found to be in possession of half a white pill, allegedly discovered tucked inside a green cigarette pack . Officers sent it to a specialist lab for testing, while Wilson himself was taken to jail. A number of rental books were found to be wet.

"Apple has sent out invitations for a media event in San Francisco on March 9, about one month before the much-anticipated launch of the new Apple Watch. The world's largest technology company did not specify what the event will be about in the invitation which reads simply 'Spring Forward,' a word play on the resetting of watches for daylight saving time. Chief Executive Tim Cook said last month that the company plans to launch the smartwatch in April. Scroll down for video . The world's largest technology company did not specify what the event will be about in the invitation which reads simply 'Spring Forward,' a word play on the resetting of watches for daylight saving time. The watch, which will let consumers check their email, pay for goods at retail stores and monitor personal health information, represents Apple's first major new product introduction since the 2010 launch of the iPad. The firm is expected to overhaul its stores in order to show off the various combinations of watch available. Shares of Apple were up 88 cents at $129.67 on Thursday. Earlier this month Tim Cook hit out at the sedentary lifestyle of many people, claiming that sitting is terrible for your health -and that the upcoming Apple Watch can help. While addressing a Goldman Sachs tech conference in San Francisco, the Apple CEO said 'a lot of doctors believe sitting is the new cancer.' Cook revealed he's been using his Apple smartwatch to remind him to get up and move every hour. 'If I sit for too long, it will actually tap me on the wrist to remind me to get up and move, because a lot of doctors think sitting is the new cancer,' said Cook. 'Ten minutes before the hour, it will remind you to move. We have a lot of people using the Apple Watch at Apple, and ten minutes before the hour, suddenly they all get up and move. Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications . The watch has a completely new user interface, different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown.' Users can turn the crown to zoom in and out on a map, or scroll a list. The crown can also be pressed to take the user back to the home screen. Different areas on the watch face can be customised with taps and swipes, and force touches. The Glances feature shows info users would like to see, similar to Google Now, and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom. Music can also be controlled on an iPhone through the Apple Watch. Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications. It understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone. Users can also talk to the watch and send a voice reply, or have it transcribed to them. There is no keyboard on the watch, and messages can only be sent through dictation, or emoji. Siri is also built into the Apple Watch. 'It took a little to get used to, but it's great.' The $349 must-have gadget starts shipping in April. According to reports, Apple experimented with sensors that measured conductivity of the skin to track stress levels and monitor heart-rate, but 'these features didn't perform consistently on some people, including those with hairy arms or dry skin'. The results were also said to have varied on how tightly the watch was being worn. Cook made the announcement just as Apple became the first company to reach a market value of $700 billion. Shares rose 1.9 percent to close at $122.02, lifting Apple's market value to $710 billion, and making it the first company to hit the $700 billion milestone. 'Sitting is the new cancer': Apple CEO made a startling statement while plugging the soon to be released Apple Watch . Cook, speaking at the Goldman Sachs Technology & Internet Conference, said Apple was hitting its stride. 'We've taken (the mobile operating system) iOS and extended it into your car, into your home, into your health. All of these are really critical parts of your life,' Cook said. 'We want one seamless kind of life. 'And so, I think that is huge for our future...We also did a lot of things to further our global footprint. And so, if you look at what we've done in China, we've opened more stores there. 'We've opened a lot more distribution there. Through the world, we've opened almost 20,000 new points of sale. The widely anticipated first Apple 'wearable' will likely start shipping in April, Cook said . The U.S. tech giant recently posted record revenue of $74.6 billion (£49.2bn) for the three months to December 31, outstripping the quarterly GDP of Israel, Greece or Denmark. Apple's cash pile is now $178 billion (£117bn), the equivalent to $556 for every American and bigger than the £95billion budget for Britain's National Health Service. Its landmark performance was driven by record-breaking sales for its iPhone 6 and 6 plus, with the firm revealing it sold 34,000 handsets every hour for the entire quarter. 'We've opened 27 new Apple Stores, lot of flagship stores.' Cook said Apple took some $50 billion in revenue in emerging markets over the past calendar year. Brian White, analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said the leading tech company has even more room to grow. 'Given Apple's powerful iPhone cycle, a big 4G ramp in China and the upcoming launch of Apple Watch in April, we believe there is still plenty to look forward to at Apple during this transformational cycle,' he said in a note to clients. 'At the same time, we believe Apple's valuation has room to expand from depressed levels.' Apple shares remain valued at reasonable levels, according to analysts, because of the whopping $18 billion quarterly profit reported recently by the iPhone and iPad maker. Using the price-earnings ratio favored by Wall Street, Apple is valued at around 16 times its annual earnings, but Fitzgerald said the value was only around 10 times the projected earnings for the next fiscal year. Apple is far ahead in market value from the number two company, oil giant Exxon Mobil, worth some $382 billion at the market close. Historic first: Apple on Tuesday became the first company in history to reach a market value of $700 billion . The record Apple quarterly profit -- on unprecedented revenue of $74.6 billion -- was driven by the sale of 74.5 million iPhones, well ahead of most analysts' expectations. Analysts are also seeing expanded adoption of the Apple Pay system that enables customers to purchase items with a tap of their iPhone, and many predict strong demand for the Apple Watch set for release in April. Separately, Apple agreed to commit $848 million for solar energy to power its data centers, according to a statement from First Solar, Inc. Cook called the effort 'our biggest, boldest, and most ambitious project ever' and said it was part of Apple's commitment on clean energy and corporate responsibility.","The Apple CEO says his smartwatch is set to vibrate intermittently to remind him to get up and move around .

"Two crew members shooting an upcoming NBC series in Morocco were injured earlier this week in a 'random mugging', sources close to the show tell Daily Mail Online. The fight happened Tuesday night, as a first assistant director and make-up artist were walking back  dinner to their apartment in Marrakech Plaza. A group of youths allegedly approached the two and attempted to rob them, and got into a fight when the filmmakers tried to defend themselves, Deadline reports. Both crew members were reportedly hospitalized for their injuries - one with a few cuts, the other with a broken arm. Two crew members shooting upcoming NBC series Odyssey were injured in Marrakech Tuesday night in an random mugging. Above, a promotional poster for the show set to air April 5, which stars  Anna Friel (pictured above), of Pushing Daisies, and Twilight's Peter Facinelli . NBC has not identified the workers, but a source close to the show says one received a few cuts and the other worker suffered a broken arm. The two were walking back to their apartment in Marrakech Plaza (a general view of the area pictured above) 'They had to go to hospital with some broken hands but hopefully they will be OK,' line producer Ahmed Abounouom told Deadline. 'This could have happened anywhere in the world. It was not on the set and it had nothing to do with the project.' NBC has refused to identify the workers, but a source close to the show says its not believed that either are American since most of the crew working on set in Morocco are not from the U.S. The incident did not take place on set, and filming has continued on schedule. Odyssey premieres on NBC on April 5. The series stars Pushing Daisies' Anna Friel as a female soldier in North Africa dealing with an international conspiracy. Twilight's Peter Facinelli  plays an attorney. Jake Robinson, of the Carrie Diaries, also starts on the show. Morocco has recently become a hub for Hollywood productions looking to film in a Middle Eastern or exotic location, since it is more stable than its other North African neighbors. Recent productions that have shot in the country include American Sniper, Game of Thrones and Mission: Impossible 5.","The first assistant director and make-up artist injured in the attack have not been named by NBC .

"Made with top notch luxury ingredients including Japanese Wagyu beef and Tellicherry peppercorns from India, this pasty, which costs a staggering £230, is the world's most expensive. The savoury snack also contains potatoes from Illinois, US, onions from France, swede from Scotland and flour from Holland. Dubbed the Very Important Pasty, the Cornish treat is the creation of chef Richard Shaw, from Southwick, Hampshire, who tracked down ingredients from all over the world to make it. The Very Important Pasty: Chef Richard Shaw (right) with his son Harrison (left) The £230 pasty contains Tellicherry peppercorns from India, potatoes from Illinois, US, onions from France, swede from Scotland, flour from Holland and Wagyu steak from Japan . The ingredients for the snack have travelled a total of 11,300 air miles to make it to the Very Important Pasty. Mr Shaw created the expensive pasty in the hope it will win this year's World Pasty Championships. The 33-year-old said: 'We came eighth in the contest last year but that was due to a lack of experience. To be called a Cornish pasty it must be made in Cornwall and be a ' savoury 'D' shaped pasty which is filled with beef, vegetables and seasonings'. It must contain sliced or diced potato, swede and onion, and the vegetable content must be at least 25 per cent of the whole pasty. Diced or minced beef must account for at least 12.5 per cent. Seasoning is also required 'primarily salt and pepper' 'These days we are turning over 3,000 pasties a week and with the VIP we're going for gold.' The father-of-six, who runs Southwick Village Store, added: 'All of these ingredients will be used to create three pasties. 'There will be one for us all to eat, another for the world championships and the third going for auction to raise money for a hospice.' This is not the first ambitious pasty that Mr Shaw has created. Last year he made the world's hottest pasty using ghost chillies, one of the hottest chillies on earth. He also created three D-Day pasties containing snails, spam and boeuf bourguignon to commemorate the June 1944 landings . Toby Black who works at Southwick Village Stores, tucking into one of the £230 pasties . Held at the Eden Project in Cornwall, the World Pasty Championship is a global competition celebrating traditional pasties as well as more exotic varieties. The Very Important Pasty will be judged on Saturday 28 February alongside 600 other entrants from all over the world. Wagyu steak from Japan - considered to be one of the best steaks in the world and costing £500 per kilogram. - is also used in the pasty. Wagyu is famed for its high fat content and delicate marbling. The fat streaked through the meat melts into the steak as it is cooked, enhancing the flavour and texture. Cows that produce Wagyu steak are believed to be given massages and fed beer. Makes two pasties . Pastry ingredients: 225g plain flour, plus extra for dusting, pinch of salt; 50g lard, chilled and diced; 50g hard margarine, chilled and cut into cubes . Filling ingredients: One potato, peeled and thinly sliced; 50g swede, peeled and thinly sliced; 115g beef skirt or chuck steak, finely diced; quarter small onion, thinly sliced; salt and ground white pepper; beaten egg or milk to glaze. Method: To make the pastry, mix together the flour and salt and rub in the fats. Gradually stir in two to three tablespoons cold water and bring everything together with your hands to form a smooth, pliable dough. Divide the dough into two balls. Preheat the oven to fan 180C/400F/gas 6. Line a baking sheet with baking parchment. On a floured work surface, roll out one ball of dough and trim to form a circle about 20cm/8in across. Slightly off-centre of the circle, place a layer of potato, then a layer of swede. Add half the beef, then half the onion, then a pinch of salt and plenty of pepper. Finally, add another thin layer of potato, to stop the meat from drying out. Carefully fold the pastry over and crimp the edges together (using a little beaten egg to seal, if wished). Place on the lined baking sheet. Repeat to make the second pasty. Glaze with a little milk or beaten egg and make a small hole in the top. Bake for 40 minutes until golden brown. Serve hot or cold.","Cornish treat is the creation of Chef Richard Shaw from Hampshire .

"Ross Etherson, pictured appearing at Isleworth Crown Court, to creating false references for doctors . A recruitment consultant created fake references for foreign doctors in a 'potentially dangerous' scam to secure them locum jobs at British hospitals. Seven locum doctors were employed by United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust and Western Sussex Hospitals NHS Trust on the basis of Ross Etherson's misleading documents, a court heard. Etherson, 34, of Balham, south London, had altered the CVs and made up references after 'being drawn into a culture of deceit' while working for Midas Medical Recruitment in Chiswick, London. The scam was estimated to have cost the NHS £37,186. Judge Robin Johnson told Isleworth Crown Court: 'It is fortunate that there is no occasion where such lack of experience on behalf of one of these doctors impacted on the health of a patient. 'But that was purely down to luck.' Etherson pleaded guilty to 21 counts of making or supplying articles for use in fraud. He was sentenced to two years in prison, suspended for 12 months, to be served concurrently for each of the 21 counts. The judge said the case raised concerns about a lack of thorough checks by hospitals and GP surgeries into the backgrounds of their locum doctors. He said: 'The facts of this case reveal that some responsible NHS managers carried out proper checks on doctors and revealed this fraud. Such managers are to be commended. 'However, there are other instances where doctors were appointed where not only were CVs false but that references were given from fictitious persons - generally from imaginary consultants. 'It appears therefore that over this period there were occasions where no proper check was made on important references. 'If there was a company that was acting in this fraudulent and dangerous way, it is of considerable public interest as to what has been done since to ensure that patients are no longer put at risk of inexperienced doctors and under-qualified doctors and the NHS does not pay for doctors on such false basis.' The scam was discovered when a clinical services manager at Lincoln County Hospital (pictured) noticed some discrepancies over the locum doctors' CVs and references . The scam was discovered when a clinical services manager at Lincoln County Hospital and Grantham District Hospital who reported concerns about some locum doctors' CVs and references to the NHS Counter-Fraud Service. There is no evidence that patients had suffered clinically as a result of the fraud. NHS Protect's fraud investigators searched Midas' Chiswick premises in April 2010, imaged computers and seized papers. When interviewed after his arrest, Etherson admitted altering and falsifying applicants' references as well as the 'UK work experience' sections of a number of their CVs, and supplying the false documents to Trusts throughout the UK. Forensic examination of the imaged computer equipment revealed faked reference letters within the CVs made use of at least eight false identities of medical consultants, either loosely based on real people or entirely made up. The manager who also covered Grantham & District Hospital (pictured)  reported concerns to the NHS Counter-Fraud Service who launched an investigation . The doctors whose CVs were altered were qualified abroad and were unaware of the scam. Judge Johnson said he was concerned that no one else had been arrested in the case, despite the court hearing how Etherson had carried out the fraud 'at the behest and encouragement' of the company where he worked. Etherson had worked for Midas between April 2009 and May 2010 where his main role was supposed to be placing adequately qualified and experienced doctors in NHS positions. Jocelyn Ledward, mitigating, told the court previously that Etherson had been drawn into a 'culture of deceit' when he took a job at Midas, where there was an attitude of 'see no evil, hear no evil'. While working there, Etherson adopted a pseudonym, as was practice in the office to pass problems on to a fictitious manager. The company also encouraged adding details of work in the UK and qualifications that did not exist in the UK. The judge told the court: 'While the counts on the indictment enabled the agency to claim £37,000 in fees, the seriousness of this fraud is that doctors were being placed where their experience was less than claimed on their CVs. 'When interviewed, Mr Etherson told police that this was the culture of this recruitment company. He was trained to carry out such a fraud from the very outset of his employment. 'He was given a prepared script to use when calling locum doctors.They would be asked to email their genuine CVs. These CVs were then embellished to add bogus experience in an effort to make the doctor more attractive to the particular NHS Trust. Etherson pleaded guilty at Isleworth Crown Court (pictured) to 21 counts of making or supplying articles for use in fraud . 'The management of Midas Medical Recruitment as it was operating in 2009/2010, not only knew about his activity but were responsible for bringing it about. The benefits to the company were all too obvious. 'The doctors were being paid as little as £15 per hour while the agency was charging up to £120 per hour for the services of these doctors. 'The man that is in the dock is at the lowest end of responsibility for this criminal conduct. No-one else has, to my knowledge, even been arrested, let alone tried for this shameful practice.' The company is still trading in the same area under a different name, with a commonality of directors. David Hall, Anti-Fraud Lead, NHS Protect, said after the sentencing today: 'Ross Etherson's potentially dangerous deception has caught up with him. He abused a position of trust for his personal gain, seeming not to care about the potential consequences for patients of receiving treatment from medical staff whose experience did not meet the requirements of their job.'","Ross Etherson faked references and CVs at Midas Medical Recruitment .

"Investigators are now looking into a possible link between a maraschino cherry factory and organized crime after the owner of the New York-based business committed suicide on Tuesday. Arthur Mondella, 57, president of Dell's Maraschino Cherries factory in Brooklyn, shot himself in the head as police broke into a drug lab hidden behind a wall. Mondella had cooperated with investigators for five hours over allegations the 67-year-old family business had been dumping hazardous waste. Scroll down for video . Arthur Mondella, (pictured) 57, the owner of Dell's Maraschino Cherries, shot himself in his office bathroom at the company's factory in Brooklyn . FBI crime scene investigators leave the maraschino cherry factory in Brooklyn with bags of evidence on Tuesday . A pot operation was found to be operating behind the walls of the family business during a separate investigation into hazardous waste . The factory floor at Dell's Maraschino Cherries - behind the owner's office, shelves of pot and hundreds of thousands of dollars was discovered . But a law enforcement source tells New York Post that the Breaking Bad-style drug operation at the cherry plant may have been been just the tip of the iceberg. 'He knew the mob would kill him,' the unnamed source told the paper. 'That’s why he shot himself. ‘Why else would you shoot yourself over 100 pounds of weed? It was the multi-million operation he lost.’ Investigators reportedly came across suspicious shelving in a storage unit - then behind a door found a false wall with the smell of weed seeping through. The entrance to a dug-out basement was then found, with three bags of marijuana inside. According to the NY Post, generators were found inside the factory along with a high-tech security outfit of dozens of cameras, barbed wire and motion-detector lights. Mondella then excused himself to go to his private bathroom, locked the door and shot himself at 1.30pm, a law enforcement source told Daily Mail Online. Before committing suicide, the third-generation cherry tycoon told his sister who was present, Joanne Capece, 'Take care of my kids'. Those present heard a single gunshot, according to CBS New York.  Mondella later died at a local hospital from the .357 magnum gunshot wound.

The paper reported Wednesday that the cherry tycoon was hiding a .357 handgun strapped to his ankle. He had another gun in his office safe. Daily Mail Online was awaiting a comment from the Brooklyn District Attorney's office on Wednesday. The DA's office and environmental regulators discovered 80-100lbs of pot in three large black bags and hundreds of thousands of dollars concealed in the secret room. Shelves operated by magnets had been used to conceal the 50-by-50 feet drug lab, which has been described as an 'extremely professional' and very expensive operation. A row of luxury vintage vehicles, including a Porsche, Rolls-Royce, a Harley-Davidson and a Mercedes, were also found covered in tarp in a back lot of the factory in the  industrial area of Red Hook. Calls to the business went unanswered Wednesday. Investigators had been looking into the company over allegations it was dumping hazardous material into the sewage system and waterways - but had suspected that the facility was also being used as a grow lab. Hundreds of thousands of dollars along with 80lbs of marijuana were reportedly discovered in the secret room behind the factory walls in Brooklyn, New York . One official told the New York Daily News: 'It appears there was another activity going on, that's for sure. I don't think you kill yourself over a bag of weed. There has to be more to it.' Brooklyn District Attorney's office had received a tip-off about the marijuana operation in 2013, the New York Post reported. Despite watching comings and goings at the factory for six months, the DA's office was unable to work out if there was a marijuana business operating inside. An anonymous source told the paper that the environmental offense warrants were simply used to get into the building. The DA's office said 'no further information about this tragedy is available at this time'. Officers consult paper work during the investigation of the cherry factory on Tuesday.

Dell's Maraschino Cherries, which has been in business for 76 years, supplies to Red Lobster, Buffalo Wild Wings, Chick-fil-A and TGI Fridays for use in cocktails and desserts. Arthur Mondella's grandfather, Arthur Mondella Sr, started the business as a Brooklyn storefront in 1948. The Brooklyn factory now turns out 400,000 bottles of cherries each week - and 19 million pounds of cherries a year. The company recently underwent a $5million overhaul and redesigned their bottles with a retro label last year after the company suffered following the financial crash in 2008. At the time Mr Mondella told The Wall Street Journal: 'At this point, the maraschino cherry is just another commodity. We’re trying to change that.' Some 25 investigators arrived at the facility at 8am on Tuesday with search warrants to inspect its operations. Mondella is survived by his ex-wife Yevgeniya and their five-year-old daughter Antoinette.

"This orphaned otter cub is on the mend after it was rescued by dogwalkers who found it lying unresponsive on the banks of a river. The six-week-old cub, named Otto, was discovered by the father and son when they heard its cries while walking in Duncombe Park, North Yorkshire, last week. It was taken to the Wildlife Haven Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre, where staff will care for it until he is fully recovered and ready to be released back into the wild. Scroll down for video . Rescued: The six-week-old cub, named Otto, was discovered by the father and son when they heard its cries while walking their dog in Duncombe Park, North Yorkshire, last week. Above, Otto cuddling with a toy . On the mend: Otto, pictured in the rescue centre, was severely underweight, dehydrated and completely exhausted when he was rescued but he has been bottle fed every four hours and is now gaining weight . Volunteers were unable to trace the family of the young otter and do not know what happened to its mother. Krista Langley, who runs The Wildlife Haven from her home in Thirsk, North Yorkshire,  said: 'When he came to us he was really very poorly but he is doing brilliantly and recovering well. 'We don't know whether something has happened to mum or if he has gone on a bit of an adventure on his own, but when he came in he had been off his mother's milk for some time. 'Otto will stay here until he is weaned and then we will move him to a rehabilitation centre where he would stay for about a year until he is ready to be released. 'But at the moment he is too young to be on his own.'

He will soon move on to fish . Ms Langley said: 'We always try to keep otters in their habitat, but if he had been there a couple of hours longer he may not have been alive. 'We took him back to the centre and he weighed less than one kilo. 'He had us worried in the evening after going quite limp and refusing to take fluids but we persevered and eventually managed to get him to drink small amounts from a syringe at first.' Ms Langley wakes up in the night to feed Otto with a special milk formula designed for puppies. He will soon move on to fish. She said: 'It is like having a baby again. Young otters who have been separated from their mothers need a lot of reassurance and love. 'He is a very affectionate and playful little thing, and likes cuddles.' The cub will stay with Ms Langley for around a month before being moved to another larger centre where he will be able to have contact with other young otters. But Ms Langley, who set up the centre  with her daughter, Lauren, said: 'The plan is always for him to be released back into the wild, which will probably be after around a year. 'I will miss him when he goes. It was difficult when he first came, you never know if they will survive or not. But he got through the first night and has been going from strength to strength ever since. 'We don't know what happened to the rest of his family. We searched the river to see if we could find any siblings, but there was no sign. 'He is too young to be out of the holt, he would have died if he hadn't been found.

"Tragic: Schoolgirl Isabel Pearce, pictured, died after choking on a meatball from her school canteen . A 13-year-old girl who suffered from a rare form of autism died after choking on a meatball from her school canteen. Isabel Pearce never regained consciousness after eating the meal at Ridge View School for special needs children in Tonbridge, Kent, during a regular lunchtime last month. The schoolgirl suffered from a rare form of autism and Sotos Syndrome and died in hospital on January 27 - the day after the incident - leaving her parents, Anthony and Jane Pearce, devastated. Mr Pearce, 56, from Ide Hill, in Sevenoaks, Kent, said her death was incomprehensible. 'It is unbelievable that it could happen. You send your child off to school - to somewhere you imagine is safe,' he said. 'She was in a good place. She was not at all compromised in any way - to any degree - that could have caused this to happen. 'Her condition did not affect how she was able to swallow. It could not have been further from the truth.' Mrs Pearce, 56, added: 'I still expect to her to come in - I suppose it is something in my brain. 'On the day it happened she was not ill, she just went to school and never came home. I hugged her. I don't normally do that. I put her in the taxi that morning. 'Her hair had been washed and she did look really beautiful.' Kent Police confirmed it is looking into the circumstances surrounding the teenagers sudden death.

"GIRL IN THE DARK . by Anna Lyndsey . (Bloomsbury £16.99) Can you imagine what it would be like suddenly to become so acutely sensitive to light that you had to exist in a totally blacked-out room? How would you cope if the glow of a computer screen, the flicker of a TV or the glimmer of sunlight made your skin burn to the point of agony? How would you survive, mentally and emotionally, if your life became reduced to a blacked-out room — a ‘lair’ — from which you might crawl at night, but only if shrouded in layers of clothing even then? Can you imagine what it would be like suddenly to become so acutely sensitive to light that you had to exist in a totally blacked-out room? (stock image) That is what Lyndsey (a pen name) has had to endure since 2005. She was enjoying a successful career as a civil servant, a new flat, a thriving social scene — and then her life was knocked sideways. One day, she noticed that, when she sat at her computer, her face burned. It became worse. Within a year, her entire body had developed a mysterious sensitivity to light, with no diagnosis and, therefore, no likelihood of a cure. This is an extraordinary memoir of horror, endurance, resourcefulness and despair. It is also a love story — because without her boyfriend (now husband) Pete, it is impossible to see how Lyndsey would have survived. Their relationship was relatively new when her problems began and, realising she could no longer live alone, Lyndsey asked if she could move into his house. He said yes. They plan one wedding, call it off (for medical reasons), then get married in 2007, at the end of a December day. She writes, ‘my love has saved me’, yet feels torn between her need for Pete and the knowledge that ‘I am sucking the light from Pete’s life, leaving him a twilit, liminal creature, single yet not single, who at social events sits alone among couples, a strange absent presence always at his side’. She wrestles with the knowledge that she is ‘occupying this lovely man, while giving him neither children nor a public companion nor a welcoming home’ — but she sets that gloomy truth against their mutual love: ‘The miracle which I live with, every day.’ Lyndsey structures the memoir with inventive skill, in a series of short chapters that flash backwards and forwards, so that, sometimes, you lose your sense of time — just like the narrator, imprisoned in her dark room. The detail can be full of gallows humour. In October 2005, Lyndsey is travelling by train to see a dermatologist, ‘wearing a dark red coat, an oversized hat with a big peak and a mask . . . cut from a dark red satin scarf, using a double layer for improved light protection . . .’ The woman opposite her glares suspiciously, and then ‘picks up her child and walks to the other end of the carriage’. Remember, this is just three months after the 7/7 bombings and, masked like Michael Jackson, Lyndsey looks bizarre. Such episodes are entertaining — even as they make you catch your breath in empathy. Lyndsey enjoys talking books (the more exciting the better), but listening to music is too heart-breaking — even though both her parents were professional musicians and she plays the piano herself. The list of all the alternative therapies she has tried is almost funny. At one point, a healer has the nerve to tell her there can be ‘a benefit to having an illness’ — and the girl in the dark wants to leap up ‘and smash the woman in the face’. She points out, very wisely, that some people have ‘an obsessive need to find meaning and pattern in human lives’. They cannot accept that something so randomly terrible can happen to another human being — whereas, of course, the proofs of ‘casual brutality’ come every day. Yet the sheer joy Lyndsey finds in a thoughtful present from her husband (a draught excluder in the shape of a funny sheep with long, spread legs), as well as the wisdom accrued from her ordeal, is evidence of that power within the human spirit that keeps hoping — with every breath. Girl In The Dark is beautifully written. The author’s intelligence shines on every page, and her will to survive (despite those black thoughts in her dark room) is inspiring. The miracle of the girl in the dark is the generosity that illuminates the lives of others by sharing her story.","Anna Lyndsey (a pen name) developed an intense sensitivity to light .

"Lib Dem Cabinet minister Danny Alexander has produced this garish Take A Break-style magazine to promote his election chances . Like all good lifestyle mags, it features family recipes, a crossword and minor celebrities. But 'Talk of the Glens' is a magazine with a difference – it is actually a political campaign leaflet for one of Britain's most high-profile MPs. Apparently modelled on 'Take a Break', the garish pamphlet is Danny Alexander's secret weapon as he bids to see off a major election challenge from the SNP in his Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey seat. It contains no fewer than 17 photos of the Chief Secretary to the Treasury – including one of him as a young child and several digitally manipulated images of Mr Alexander from the internet. With the catchline 'true life stories from the Highlands', the magazine includes a recipe for 'Danny's sausage and butternut squash stew' – which includes 'roughly diced' squash but 'finely chopped' onion - and a crossword that offers the prize of a bottle of Dalwhinnie single malt whisky. As of last night, the Lib Dems had received 16 entries from constituents who solved clues such as: Village near Kilravock Castle (4); Famous Highland actress (5,6); and Caley Thistle all-time top goalscorer (6). Former LibDem MSP Jamie Stone has an 'exclusive' interview with 'our champion' Danny, while TV presenter Quentin Wilson makes an appearance and Mr Alexander's father Di tells the magazine a 'little bit' about his childhood. 'Our family home on Colonsay had no mains electricity and relied on of diesel generators that ran for just a few hours a day,' he reveals. There is also a tongue-in-cheek feature on last year's internet 'meme' involving the LibDem Cabinet Secretary, who was photographed strolling on the banks of Loch Morlich in semi-casual attire. Social media users agreed the snap would make the perfect cover for a contemporary easy listening CD album, and the idea sparked dozens of other doctored images entitled 'Danny Walks' – including the politician walking away from an explosion, landing on the moon and joining the Reservoir Dogs movie line-up. The first copies of Talk of the Glens were put through letterboxes this week, and the LibDem team is now working on a 'tabloid newspaper' to be handed out before the General Election on May 7. Mr Alexander has an 8,765 majority in Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, however his share of the vote is expected to collapse. A recent poll from Lord Ashcroft suggests there could be a massive 25.5 per cent swing to the SNP, which has chosen Highland Council leader Drew Hendry as its candidate. Mr Alexander has admitted he faces a tough challenge. 'I don't really believe the numbers in these local polls but they do reflect a truth, which is that in this constituency, it's going to be a very close battle,' he told online news site Buzzfeed. 'It's very much a head-to-head contest between myself and the Scottish Nationalists. And I don't underestimate that I've got a real fight on my hands.' The pamphlet includes 'Danny's sausage and butternut squash stew' and quotes from supporters that he is a 'good sport' There is also a tongue-in-cheek feature on last year's internet 'meme' involving the Treasury minister, who was photographed strolling on the banks of Loch Morlich in semi-casual attire . There is a sprinkle of celebrity stardust with a picture of former Top Fear host Quentin Willson, and an interview in which Mr Alexander discusses being called a 'ginger rodent' by Labour's Harriet Harman . In keeping with the magazine theme, there is even a crossword that offers the prize of a bottle of Dalwhinnie single malt whisky . In Talk of the Glens, former LibDem leader Charles Kennedy – MP for neighbouring Ross, Skye and Lochaber – adds: 'In government, Danny has delivered for our Highland communities.' There is a sprinkle of celebrity stardust with a picture of former Top Fear host Quentin Willson, and an interview in which Mr Alexander discusses being called a 'ginger rodent' by Labour's Harriet Harman. And in the interview with the minister's father, Di Alexander reveals he was brought up in 'traditional settings', 'prospered' at school' and says 'his heart is truly here in the Highlands'. Mr Alexander has already faced claims he is shoring up votes in his Highlands seat with increased spending while imposing cutbacks elsewhere. Cash secured for his area includes a tax break for ski-lifts, a bail-out for the sleeper train from London to Scotland and more money to fund exceptions to housing benefit than any other council. Earlier this year, a deal was also secured to hand a 5p petrol rebate to motorists in rural areas, including parts of constituencies represented by LibDem MPs Mr Kennedy, John Thurso, and Mr Alexander. Last month, UK party leader Nick Clegg unveiled plans to funnel hundreds of millions of pounds through a 'city deal' for Inverness, which he said he wanted to sign-off before the election. Some £2million was also found to promote the home of the Loch Ness monster. The Treasury issued a press notice declaring that the 'iconic landmark Loch Ness will benefit from an extra £2million government investment to boost inbound tourism'. The campaign promises 'extensive advertising, digital and business to business activity launched in key tourism markets featuring the famed Loch Ness monster until 2019'. But Mr Alexander said: 'I think I'm the only MP in the country who gets attacked by his opponents for delivering too much to his constituency.' SNP candidate Drew Hendry said: 'Here we see the difference between the priorities of the Lib Dems and those of the SNP. 'Danny Alexander talks about stew and tablet recipes whilst planning a menu of austerity cuts. In more ways than one, people can't stomach what he is offering – which is what is really making him the 'talk of the glens'. 'Unlike the Lib Dems, the SNP have a positive story about our successes in government to tell people in the Highlands and we will never prop up a Tory government - which is why more and more local people are putting their faith in us as we approach the election.' Mr Alexander has previously been accused of funelling public money towards his seat in a bid to shore up support.","Garish campaign pamphlet  produced by Treasury minister appears to be based on Take a Break magazine .

"The Brooklyn Cherry King who shot himself dead on Tuesday was able to hide his massive marijuana business thanks to his cherries. Arthur Mondella, 57, was able to keep investigators in the dark  as the smell of the 400,000 pounds of Maraschino cherries his plant processed each week managed to mask the stench of the up to 1,200 marijuana plants he was capable of growing. Furthermore, the other red flag for authorities would have been the heightened electric bill from running grow lamps - something that was also masked by his large operation. Scroll down for video . Arthur Mondella (above) hid his massive marijuana business with his massive cherry business authorities believe .

The New York Daily News reports that investigators then discovered a crawl space that led to a 50-foot-by-50-foot area that was divided into several rooms. Authorities now believe the rooms were for growing the plans. One room contained seeds of 60 different marijuana strains and about $125,000 in cash. Salvatore Capece (left), nephew of Mondella, and Dominique Mondella (right), his daughter, continued the family legacy by working at Dell's Maraschino Cherries . They believe a crop had just been harvested, as only three bags with about 100 pounds of marijuana were discovered during their search. All that, along with 120 expensive grow lamps, were completely hidden, leading one source to speculate he could have been working alone and not with the help of others at the company. 'In theory, it could have been him and outsiders,' said the source. 'This is a secreted part of a large factory that was designed so a large number of employees won’t know.' Despite all this, the company, which has contracts with numerous national restaurant chains such as Red Lobster, Buffalo Wild Wings, Chick-fil-A and TGI Fridays, is back in business and family lawyer Michael Farkas states managers are cooperating fully with the District Attorney's investigation. Mondella is survived by three children from two marriages.

"Sea levels along the north-east coast of America rose almost four inches (10.16 cm) in just two years, a report has revealed. The record increase north of New York City between 2009 and 2010 is being described by experts as an ‘unprecedented’ one in 850-year event. And in Portland, Maine, sea levels rose by five inches (12.7 cm) over the same two year period, researchers found. Sea levels along the north-east coast of America rose almost four inches in just two years, a report has revealed. Pictured is Plum Island, located north-east of New York City . The report, published in the journal Nature Communications, warned that coastal areas would need to prepare for ‘extreme’ sea-level events. Experts at the University of Arizona and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration studied data from tidal records along the east coast of both the US and Canada. Professor Jianjun Yin of the University of Arizona told the BBC: ‘The extreme sea level rise event during 2009-10 along the northeast coast of North America is unprecedented during the past century. ‘When coastal storms occur, extreme sea levels can lead to elevated storm surge. The record increase north of New York City (pictured) between 2009 and 2010 is being described by experts as an ‘unprecedented’ one in 850-year event . A graph shows yearly sea level rise along the northeast North American coast in millimeters per year. The red bar shows how extreme the spike was in 2009. This spike lasted into 2010 . ‘In addition to long-term and gradual sea level rise, coastal communities will need to prepare for short and extreme sea level rise events.’ The researcher told the Washington Post that the sea level had dropped following the spike but that it was still 'much higher' than when the spike started in 2009. He added that global warming 'definitely contributed to this event.' The website points to the unusually high tides that were widely reported in 2009 and 2010 from North Carolina’s Cape Hatteras to Canada. The study’s authors wrote that in terms of beach erosion, the 2009-2010 sea rise was ‘almost as significant as some of the hurricane events’. The quickest jump in sea levels took place between April 2009 and March 2010, it says. One of the researchers, Paul Goddard, added: 'The sea level rise of 2009-2010 sticks out like a sore thumb for the Northeast.' Researchers believe it was caused by a 30 per cent slowdown in a key ocean current system called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), as well as changes in atmospheric pressure at sea level, the Huffington Post reported. The study used information gathered from a series of tide gauges along the east coast with the four inch rise taken from the average of 14 gauges between Canada and New York. The Arctic could be completely free of ice in just 40 years as a result of global warming, one of the world's leading climate change experts has warned. This would cause sea levels to rise to nearly unmanageable levels. Nobel Peace Prize winner Professor Oleg Anisimov said there is evidence that temperatures are rising four times faster in the frozen region than the rest of the planet. This means that there will only be open water in the polar region by the 2050s, with nothing more than a few floating icebergs at the North Pole, according to the Russian academic. Professor Anisimov, from the State Hydrological Institute in St Petersburg, gave his stark warning during a lecture in the Sakha Republic - the coldest part of Russia. He forecasts that the region will see temperature rises of up to 7°C within a century. ‘For several reasons, the Arctic climate change is more intense and faster than in other regions. There is a reduction in snow and ice cover, which has a protective function,’ he said. ‘On average over the last year, the minimum area of sea ice has decreased from 5.4 to 5.3 million square kilometres [two million square miles]. Over the past 10 years, the reduction of sea ice in the Arctic was by 13.7 per cent. As well as rising sea waters, such climate change could threaten delicate ecosystems and marine life. According to environmentalists, as the snow and ice melts, the ability of the Arctic region to reflect heat back into space is reduced and the rate of global warming is accelerated once more. This could spark increasing numbers of forest fires and unpredictable storms and, at worst, bring a halt to the Gulf Stream which warms Europe. Sea levels rose four inches from New York to Newfoundland (red dots) in 2009 and 2010. Gauges from New York south to Cape Hatteras (pink dots) showed a smaller spike for the same time period. No sea level spike was recorded on the gauges (white dots) south of Cape Hatteras . Data gathered further south found that the rise in sea-levels were more in keeping with average figures. The University of Reading's Dr Dan Hodson, told the BBC that the data showed the importance of analysing links between ocean currents and surges in sea levels. He said: 'Sea level change is a complex phenomenon, especially on the regional scale, where changes to the global ocean circulation can play a major role. 'The east coast of North America is quite close to an area of active, fast ocean currents, and so is quite sensitive to changing ocean circulation.' The findings come a month after researchers at Harvard University found that the world's sea levels had risen faster than expected in the last 20 years as a result of global warming and other factors.","Waters north of New York rose by record levels between 2009 and 2010 .

"Just a few weeks ago 75-year-old Mr Saru, crematorium operator in the tiny village of Kaliori in central Java, Indonesia had his 'kolumbarium' swarming overnight with 50 police. As officers guarded the entrance, the veteran of the Giri Laya Krematorium and his wife went about their business. A group of 'special guests' gathered in the white-tiled auditorium adjoining the primitive ovens which Mr Saru employs to effectively cremate the dead. Mr Saru (pictured) is the operator of the Giri Laya Krematorium in Kaliori in central Java . The reason for the high security in the early hours of January 18 was that two men who had just been executed on Nusakambangan Island off the southern coast of Java had wished to be cremated. Their remains were ferried by ambulance under police escort to Giri Laya and handed over to Mr Saru while the men's relatives assembled for a Christian ceremony to honour their loved ones. After a six hour process - three hours in the furnace and three cooling down - Mr Saru opened the heavy doors of his two ovens and gently swept out the ashes for two terracotta urns. After finishing their job, Mr and Mrs Saru went back to their home to rest. Along with his wife (pictured), Mr Saru cremates the dead who have been executed on Nusakambangan . 75-year-old Mr Saru and his wife are the guardsmen of the Giri Laya crematorium in Indonesia . It takes Mr Saru three hours to burn a body in a wooden coffin and another three hours to let the ashes cool before they are removed . The bereaved aunt and wife of the two condemned men took their urns and prepared for the final journey of their nephew and husband, after long years on death row in Indonesian prisons, home. Indonesia's death penalty and the country's attitude to death and capital punishment, has been brought into high relief by a round of six executions in central Java, and a further pending 11. Mr Saru happily opens the doors to his facilities as public protests and legal battles continued against the scheduled executions of four Indonesians, a Philippino woman, a French, Ghanian, Nigerian and Brazilian men and the two Australian Bali Nine ringleaders, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. Heavy roller beds on mini railway tracks transport the remains into each furnace, which are then closed off by a brick door weighing 1,000kg and sealed with wet dirt . These are the tools Mr Saru uses to collect the ashes of the dead. Prisoners who are executed on Nusakambangan are taken to his crematorium . While Indonesian television has broadcast detailed recreations of the Indonesian method of execution by a highly trained paramilitary mobile unit armed with sophisticated weaponry, much of Mr Saru's equipment for disposing of remains seemed steeped in centuries past. The Giri Laya Krematorium lives up a dusty lane from the village in southwestern central Java's Banyumas province, one hour's drive north of the port to Nusakambangan island. From the outside it looks like an old primary school with peeling painted concrete and an open sided area for waiting relatives. The two chambers use a diesel generated engine to burn the bodies . After finishing their job, Mr and Mrs Saru went back to their home to rest . This is the view from Giri Laya crematorium. Mr Suru does not know when the guards from Nusakambangan will come knocking on his door again . The two furnaces lie behind a wall of tiles and steel mesh with a sign that reads in Bahas Indonesia 'Daycare Ashes (Kolumbarium). Heavy roller beds on mini railway tracks transport the remains into each furnace, which are then closed off by a brick door weighing 1000kg and sealed with wet dirt. The ovens are fuelled by diesel oil piped into the back from 50 gallon drums. These are the tools Mr Suru uses to collect the ashes from the chamber . Mr Suru transports the ashed to this urn when they are cooled and ready . He said he had not been informed when he might again be greeting police officers and relatives up from Nusakambangan in the middle of the night . These are the two burning chambers as Giri Laya crematorium. Bodies transported into the chambers on the bricks and then rolled into the crematorium . Mr Saru displayed the tools of his trade which helped him gather the ash from the roller bed after the process to collect the remains, and cheerfully discussed the intricacies of his business. He said he had not been informed when he might again be greeting police officers and relatives up from Nusakambangan in the middle of the night.","Mr Saru cremates dead prisoners after their execution on 'death island'

"Running around town centres just got a whole lot more interesting - thanks to a new craze in which joggers create shapes and spell out words using GPS apps which record their routes. The latest version of the trend is to create giant animals  by snaking through populated areas to map the outline of their shapes. Runners from West Sussex are now competing to produce the most impressive animal and have already mapped out a puppy, giraffe, elephant, reindeer and bird. Scroll down for video . Spring in their step: A group of runners from West Sussex have caught on to the new run-mapping trend by jogging a winding five-mile route around their home county to form the shape of a puppy . Runner Chris Robinson, 43, was one of the first people to attempt the trend - jogging a shape of a cow and using a GPS tracker to map it on running app Strava before posting it to his Facebook page. The father-of-two, from Rustington, received streams of positive feedback and believes the craze could be a new way of encouraging people to get fit. He said three strangers soon joined his quest to make animal art, and the group all ran the Brighton Half Marathon together on Sunday each logging record times. Co-owner of a marketing firm Mr Robinson said: 'It started when I came back from a run and saw my route and it looked a bit like a cow's head. New craze: One of the group's runners formed the shape of an elephant by snaking through the streets of East Preston in West Sussex . Intricate: Another run through East Preston formed the shape of a crow using smartphone app Strava . 'I thought if I can do a head then I wonder if I can find a body and I spent ages on the map to find a whole cow. 'I put it on Facebook and got a lot of comments and I put a link to a sponsor page for a race I was running. 'Someone who sponsored me said here's £20, now do a giraffe. So I did. 'Then Clare who I had never met wanted to do a better job so she did Rudolf the reindeer and even did a red nose by running round a roundabout for 20 minutes.' A large dog is formed thanks to a snaking route through seaside resort Littlehampton, West Sussex . Christmas special: The group formed the outline of a reindeer using the app Strava . Through the app Mr Robinson rallied a team consisting of Clare Bartlett, 39, of Rustington, Howard Crompton, 35, of Angmering, and Kevin Bett, 32, of Littlehampton, and they started running animals across West Sussex together, in October. They recently shaped a puppy together in a five-mile run that saw them running round in circles in a park to form its eye. Mr Robinson added: 'It required going to Google maps and working out that we had to start at a dog poo bin then run a perfect circle. We must've looked like idiots. 'But we got to the end of the end of the run and we didn't feel like we'd run five miles at all.' Apps Strava (left) and MapMyRide (right) help runners and cyclists to record information such as distance, average speed, elevation and how many calories they have burned . Animal-shape runners: (L-R) Kevin Bett, Howard Crompton and Chris Robinson after the Brighton Marathon . The West Sussex animal run craze was started by Chris Robinson, who created the outline of this cow and posted it on Facebook . New incentive: Mr Robinson believes the craze could be a novel way of encouraging people to go running . He raised £1,258 in the 13.1-mile half marathon and donated it to the Springboard Project, a charity that has supported his 12-year-old daughter Bella who has autism. The craze has also become popular in San Francisco, with cyclists and runners both using the app to map out shapes and messages to potential employers and to loved ones. Dan Miller, of San Francisco, recently hit the pavement in the city's SOMA neighborhood just before applying to Strava for a job. Using the firm's app he spelled out 'hire me'. 'Hire me': Dan Miller ran a convoluted eight miles in San Francisco's SOMA neighborhood to spell the words 'hire me' in the hope of snagged a job with the company whose app allows him to track the route . Strava, MapMyRide and various other so-called 'cyclist apps' work on a very similar basis. Their point? To allow riders to record their activity on a range of compatible GPS devices, including iPhone, Android, some fitness watches and Google Glass. The kind of data they can record include the distance and where the cyclist has been on a detailed map - pinpointing exactly where the rider has been from start to end. Calories burned, duration, speed, elevation and pace are also among the features it can track. Some even give suggested routes, uploaded by other users. Cyclists can then browse, analyse and compare their efforts with previous ones as well as other users and challenge themselves to do better. Their results can also be shared with friends and ranked on a leaderboard. Work of art: One Strava user created this turkey during a ride around San Francisco . Fanatic: A baseball fan mapped out the logo for the San Francisco Giants during a 22.7mile ride around the city .

"Sauvignon Blanc - the white wine that smells of gooseberries - is Britain's favourite plonk, according to new research. It pipped Chardonnay, our second most popular, in the first 'Grape Britain' wine map, based on the tastes of more than 400,000 drinkers. The study of sales data at Laithwaite's Wine also revealed more Champagne bottles are popped in the well heeled City of London and Westminster than anywhere else. Laithwaite's buyer Beth Willard said the UK is a 'nation of wine connoisseurs, with our own unique tastes' And residents of the seaside resort town of Bournemouth, known for its high number of pensioners, like to paint the town red with a glass or two of Merlot and Malbec. Meanwhile, Liverpudlians like to add a bit of sparkle to their lives with the city uncovered as the capital of Prosecco, while Cabernet Sauvignon flies off the shelves in Slough. Glasses of Champagne are sunk in the well heeled City of London and Westminster than anywhere else . The analysis of more than a hundred grape varieties and wine regions found Sauvignon Blanc, made from green grapes, came out on top as the most popular wine in almost every British town, city and county. Only Berkshire bucks the trend, drinking more of our second favourite grape, Chardonnay. But the dominance of the two big hitters paints just half the picture because in the last year Laithwaite's, the UK's largest home delivery wine merchant, has sold wines made from more than 40 different single grape varieties. A closer look at the figures reveals our wine tastes are far more varied and diverse. The researchers found Glasgow has the greatest penchant for spicy red Grenache, with the highest proportion of bottles sold here. Trendy Hammersmith and Fulham is keeping Beaujolais Nouveau fashionable, and Rosé is most at home in Ramsgate. When it comes to sparkling, Liverpool came out on top as the city with the highest percentage of Prosecco drinkers, while unsurprisingly, Champagne flutes are filling up most frequently in the City of London and Westminster. 1.

'What it shows is that, while Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay have a huge nationwide appeal, we are actually a nation of wine connoisseurs, with our own unique tastes . 'We have seen a slight shift in the nation's palate over the last few years to wines made from lesser known varieties and from less mainstream regions. 'Wines from Romania and Hungary are becoming more popular than traditional favourites like Italian Pinot Grigio. Sauvignon Blanc's dominance at the top of that list might soon be challenged.'","White wine that smells of gooseberries pipped Chardonnay to number one .

"Eighteen students and two staff taking part on an outdoors leadership trip to the Grand Canyon have been rescued by a helicopter after they became trapped by heavy snow. After five days of camping at Sowats Point to learn leadership skills, the group of 16 students, two graduate student assistants and two faculty members from Northern Arizona University realized the roads they had used to reach the campsite were covered by 18 to 34 inches of snow from a storm. Their two vans, which only had two-wheel drive capabilities, became stuck in the snow and they called relatives and the university for help. Staff then contacted the Coconino County Sheriff's Office. But because the helicopter could only carry three students at a time, the mission took 11 hours on Tuesday and the aircraft needed two re-fueling stops, NBC reported. Scroll down for video . Flown to safety: This helicopter flew 18 college students and two staff members to safety on Tuesday after they became trapped in the Grand Canyon following a five-day camping trip . Stuck: When they tried to leave their camping site on Monday, their two vans became stuck in the snow . Covered: Authorities said between 18 and 24 inches of snow fell on the area during a snow storm on Monday . The students were flown  to Jacob Lake, where university vehicles were waiting to take them back to the campus, the sheriff's office said. The group eventually returned to the campus at around 7.30pm on Tuesday - but the students said they were never worried for their safety. 'It actually was just a wonderful experience,' student Maddie Petty told KPHO. 'These guys are just very prepared and they know what they're doing, so I never gave it a second thought really.' They were participating in the Parks and Recreation Management Outdoor Education and Leadership program at the time. Heading home: Over 11 hours on Tuesday, the students were flown in groups of three to waiting vans . Safe: The students can be seen arriving back at campus on Tuesday evening, but authorities said the group had been well-prepared for the weather and the students said they never feared for their safety . The university said the trip, which is led by wilderness experts, has been carried out for years, and that all members of the group were properly equipped for the weather. They were also carrying a satellite phone, which they used to call for help. 'Everyone's fine, they were in very good spirits,' said Tom Bauer, director of public affairs for the university. 'I'm hearing it was considered an adventure. These are people who like the outdoors.' Gerry Blair, a sheriff's spokesman, told AZCentral that the rescue was just one of several search and rescue operations a week - but this one was different. 'It was nice that they were calm and knew what they were doing,' he said. 'This group was prepared.' Breathtaking: An image from January shows the Grand Canyon covered in snow.

"Eco-warrior: Prince Charles yesterday called on people to improve their health by looking after the planet, which had said needed treatment . Prince Charles yesterday called on people to improve their health by looking after the planet. In a keynote address to the Royal Society in London, the prince said: 'Protect the health of the planet, protect our health. 'Actions which are good for the planet are also good for human health.' He added: 'Taking a more active approach to transport by walking and cycling and adopting healthy diets reduce greenhouse gas emissions and but also reduce rates of obesity, heart disease, cancer and more – saving lives and money. 'Reductions in air pollution also result, with separate and additional benefits, to human health. A healthy planet and healthy people are two sides of the same coin.' The event yesterday linked Charles's International Sustainability Unit and the World Health Organisation, bringing together health ministers, senior civil servants and health professionals. The prince described the United Nations Climate Change Conference, to take place later this year, as one of our 'last opportunities' to keep a lid on global warming. 'We can only pray that our sick planetary patient might be placed on a road to recovery, in the process bringing gains for human well-being,' he said. 'Failure to write the prescription, however, might leave us contemplating the death certificate instead. 'So, my fervent hope is that you can find the means to make the difference that our world so desperately needs.' The heir to the throne went on to highlight research which described the phenomenon as 'the greatest threat to human health of the 21st century'. He said: 'I hardly need to tell you we are faced, I fear, as far as the problem of human-induced climate change is concerned, with a challenge of astonishing complexity. 'The fact of climate change is now accepted by every major scientific body in the whole world. The event at the Royal Society, pictured, linked Charles's International Sustainability Unit and the World Health Organisation, bringing together health ministers, senior civil servants and health professionals . 'The gravity and immediacy of the threat it poses to us and our children and grandchildren is also accepted by constituencies that can scarcely be accused of being part of some half-baked conspiracy dreamt up by extreme environmentalists intent on undermining capitalism. 'These constituencies include the UN, the World Bank; The Pentagon and the UK Ministry of Defence, the CIA, NSA. ... and, I'm happy to say, nurses and doctors.'

"Apple is set to launch a giant iPad called the iPad Plus this year to take on the rising challenge from Microsoft's surface and Android tablets, it has been claimed. The firm is also hoping the larger screen will help it differentiate the iPad from the big screen iPhone 6 Plus. The big screen tablet is believed to be planned for release towards the end of the year. Scroll down for video . The new iPad would dwarf Apple's existing range of machines. Rhoda Alexander, an analyst at market researcher IHS, said the pans were already well advanced. 'Our supply side (sources say) it's a go for 2015,' Alexander told FoxNews.com. 'The release timing is fuzzy, It may not appear until Q4 (fourth quarter) with the other iPad updates. 'We are, however, getting input from both the component and [product] side that this is a real product, and part of their 2015 building plan.' Apple CEO Tim Cook, in the company's most recent earnings conference call in January, talked about the iPad's future. 'Over the long arc of time the iPad is a great business,' he said. 'I also have visibility obviously of what's in the pipeline and feel very, very good about that.' Earlier this month a pose on Chinese networking site Weibo leaked what it claimed were the specs for the device. Apparently, the tablet will feature a 12.9-inch display with 2K resolution, and a 7mm thin profile. The leak also said the tablet is supposed to weigh 700g and pack a large 11,000 mAh battery, significantly bigger than the iPad Air 2's 7,340 mAh battery. The tablet is also expected to have four speakers, and could even features two charging ports allowing it to remain plugged in when in either portrait of landscape mode. Late last year a leaked design for a case revealed more details of Apple's much rumoured iPad tablet. According to French blog nowhereelse.fr, the case is from a 'reliable source' which has previously given them advance details of Apple's product, which the firm is notoriously secretive about. It 'would be equipped with a screen measuring from 12.2 to 12.9 inches diagonally,' it says. The tablet is also expected to have four speakers, and could even featur two charging ports allowing it to remain plugged in when in either portrait of landscape mode. It comes weeks after an image was leaked that appeared to be a mould for the device. The photo was reportedly taken at Apple manufacturer Foxconn's factory in China and is said to measure approximately 12 inches high by 8.7 inches wide. It follows a leaked sketch from last week that claimed to show one corner of the so-called megapad, iPad Pro or iPad Air Plus. The photo of the mould (pictured) was reportedly taken at Apple manufacturer Foxconn's factory in China. Experts have estimated that the mould would produce a tablet that measures 12 inches in height, 8.7 inches wide and 0.27 inches deep (305.3mm x 220.8 mm x 7mm). The latest image was posted on Chinese social network Weibo. If the rumours are true, the iPad Pro would be significantly larger than the current iPad Air 2. Experts have estimated that the mould would produce a tablet that measures 12 inches in height, 8.7 inches wide and 0.27 inches deep (305.3mm x 220.8 mm x 7mm). By comparison, the iPad Air 2 is 9.4 inches by 6.7 inches by 0.24 inches (240mm x 169.5mm x 6.1mm). Name: Popular suggestions for the name of the supersized tablet include the iPad Air Plus - taking its lead from Apple's iPhone 6 Plus smartphone, and the iPad Pro. Size: The tablet is rumoured to have a 12.2 inch screen, although other dimensions have also been suggested. Rumours suggest it will be just 7mm thick. Design: The leaked 'sketch' suggests that the iPad Air Plus will be similar in design to the iPad Air 2, with its rounded corners and also share the same placement of buttons on its edges. USP: The image differs from the smaller tablet however, because of grilles on the top of the shell, which suggest the device will include stereo speakers, as rumoured. Launch: Sources have suggested different launch times, but there is some consensus that the tablet may make its debut before the summer. The iPad Air 2 has a 9.7-inch display, while the iPad Pro is rumoured to have a 12.2-inch screen. This would put the Pro on par with Samsung's 12.2-inch Galaxy Note Pro, which launched in February. Last week's leaked sketch, also reportedly taken by an employee who works at Foxconn seemed to show a grille that will also boast four speakers for stereo sound. The image was released by French website Nowhere Else, which has previously leaked details  from unannounced smartphones and Apple gadgets which proved to be true, citing a Foxconn source. The source said that initial testing for the iPad Air Plus was stopped in the summer and Apple's suppliers will soon start mass production of the tablet. The sketch suggests that the tablet will look similar to the iPad Air 2 in design, with rounded corners and the same standby button, rear camera, microphone and volume buttons placement. However, seemingly confirming rumours that the larger tablet will offer stereo sound, there appears to be a speaker grill on the top of the shell. Japanese magazine Mac Fan claimed in December that the iPad Air Plus will also feature a much faster A9 processor and is set to launch between April and June. By comparison, the iPad Air 2 (pictured) is 9.4 inches x 6.7 inches by 0.24 inches (240 mm x 169.5 mm x 6.1 mm). Sources have suggested different launch times for the iPad Air Plus, but the general consensus is that the supersized tablet may make its debut before the summer . A leaked photo of a sketch (pictured) reportedly taken by an employee who works in a Foxconn factory, where iPads are made, also suggests that the rumours of an 'iPad Air Plus' with a 12.2 inch screen, are true . Bloomberg and other publications reported that Apple was planning on releasing the device sometime in early 2015, while a recent report from The Wall Street Journal said the Californian firm had postponed mass production of the larger iPad from December 2014 into next year as suppliers struggled to meet demand for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus launch. These designs showed the gadget as just 7mm thick, but the size of the screen is uncertain, with rumours suggesting measurements between 12 inches and 12.9 inches. The first suggestion of a supersized tablet came just weeks after claims that the large screen size of the iPhone 6 Plus was impacting on iPad usage. The release of Apple's iPhone 6 Plus means there is now only a 2.4-inch difference between the size of the phablet's screen, and the display on its iPad mini. Analysis has revealed that as phones become larger, more people are using them for watching videos or reading - making their tablets almost redundant. The iPad Air 2 has a 9.7-inch display, while the iPad Pro is rumoured to have a 12.2-inch screen.This would put the Pro on par with Samsung's Galaxy Note Pro, which launched last February (pictured) The iPad Air Plus is expected to have a 12.2inch screen or even larger, dwarfing the iPad Mini with its 7.9inch screen (left) and iPad Air (right) with a 9.7 inch screen . A study by Pocket - an app that lets users save webpages, videos and other content for reading - recently found that people who upgraded to an iPhone 6 Plus use their tablets 36 per cent less than before. It analysed more than two million articles and videos that were opened using the app, and compared the before and after behaviour in people who previously owned an iPhone 5, 5C and 5S and those who now own an iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. It also looked at the use of tablets by the same people. A survey comparing the  before-and-after behaviour of iPhone and iPad users revealed that people with an iPhone 5S use their phone 55% of the time, but this increases to 72% for the iPhone 6 and 80% for the iPhone 6 Plus - both at the detriment of the iPad, perhaps explaining why Aple is planning a larger one . Pocket also saw users with both an iPhone and an iPad watched significantly more content as soon as they upgraded to an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus. Those with the iPhone 6 (centre) opened 33% more articles and videos inside Pocket than they did with a 5S (left), and those with a 6 Plus (right) opened 65% more items than before . The iPhone 6 accounted for 68 per cent of all sales through September and into early October, while its larger model took between 23 and 24 per cent. Apple's cheaper iPhone 5S and 5C handsets made up the rest of the sales. Following last year's launch, the 5S and 5C accounted for 84 per cent of total iPhone sales in the first 30 days - proving the 6 range is more popular. The skew is being blamed on reports that stocks of the iPhone 6 Plus are lower because Apple is struggling to complete orders. Recent figures from Pocket also found that two-and-a-half more Pocket users are opting for an iPhone 6 as opposed to a 6 Plus. 'The bigger your phone's screen, the more time you'll spend reading and watching on it,' explained the researchers in a blog post. 'In fact, the bigger your phone's screen, the more you'll read and watch as a whole.' It discovered that users who upgraded to an iPhone 6 now view content on their phones 72 per cent of the time, up from 55 per cent when they owned on a smaller screen. Pocket also saw that users with both an iPhone and an iPad watched significantly more content as soon as they upgraded to an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus. But, a larger screen does make the smartphone less portable and Pocket noticed that people with an iPhone 6 Plus read 22 per cent less on their morning commutes than those with a smaller model. Recent figures from Pocket also found that two-and-a-half more Pocket users are opting for an iPhone 6 as opposed to a 6 Plus.

"A Las Vegas woman caught on tape setting fire to the pet store she owned with 27 dogs still inside failed to sway the court by revealing her pregnancy Wednesday. Gloria Eun Hye Lee, 36, was given 5 to 14 years in prison at a sentencing hearing after announcing she was three months pregnant. Prosecutor Shanon Clowers called Lee's last minute revelation that she was pregnant by her estranged husband an attempt to get a 'get out of jail free card.' Scroll down for video . Unswayed: Gloria Eun Hye Lee, 36, was given 5 to 14 years in prison after announcing she was three months pregnant at her sentencing hearing Wednesday . Security cameras in Prince and Princess pet store, in southwest Las Vegas, recorded Lee back in January 2014 removing files from the store before Kirk Bills, set to be sentenced Monday, set it on fire. Prosecutors said that Bills had poured flammable liquid on the floor and laid out newspaper in front of kennels where 25 puppies and 2 adult dogs were crated. The blaze triggered the building's sprinkler system, which extinguished the flames before firefighters even arrived on the scene, leaving the animals unharmed. Lee took a plea deal in October that included pleading guilty to arson, insurance fraud and attempted animal cruelty charges in exchange for prosecutors dropping 28 more charges. Clark County District Court Judge David Barker told Lee that the pregnancy announcement was part of a 'continued effort by you to influence this process.' The sentence handed down on Wednesday was close to the maximum Clowers sought. Safe and sound: The puppies were rescued, first by the sprinkler system and then by firefighters responding to the blaze . Adopted: The 25 puppies went to homes after a drawing, held as a benefit for local shelter Lied Animal Shelter while two adult dogs were placed with families . Caught: Security footage showed an individual wearing a hood spreading liquid and newspaper and lighting the store on fire. Bills pleaded guilty to arson and attempted animal cruelty in October. Fleeing: Lee (left) was arrested in January shortly after the blaze was set while Bills was caught in Indiana and extradited to Nevada . The Las Vegas Review Journal reported that Lee had originally posted $40,000 bail and was on house arrest until February, when Clowers filed a criminal complaint with 31 charges. 27 of those charges were divided among each one of the puppies at the store, which landed Lee back in jail with bail set at $310,000. Lee had a history of convictions in California stretching back to 1999 on charges of forgery, larceny from a bank and escape. The trial brought protests from animal rights groups, which appeared in front of the courthouse at most of Lee's and Bills' appearances. The 25 puppies taken from the store were adopted for $250 each after a drawing was held March 2014, with the proceeds going to Lied Animal Shelter. Charity Home 4 Spot placed the two adult dogs with families.","Gloria Eun Hye Lee, 36, was given a maximum sentence of 14 years .

"Archaeologists have uncovered what is believed to be the only inscribed tomb and matching remains ever found from Roman Britain. The discovery of the limestone tombstone and skull was found while excavating a car park in Cirencester and they are believed to date back to between the 1st and 3rd centuries. And based on inscriptions the grave is believed to have belonged to a 27-year-old female called Bodica. Archaeologists have uncovered what is believed to be the only inscribed tomb and matching remains ever found from Roman Britain. The inscription on the stone reads: 'DM [Dis Manibus, in the hands of God], Bodica, the wife lived years: 27' and it was found under a car park in Cirencester . Despite the similar name, it is unlikely to be Queen Boudica because her Iceni tribe was centred further east in Norwich and she was said to be have been in her 30s when she died. The experts said it is also rare to find a stone with such an ornate inscription in the UK. Archaeologists from Cotswold Archaeology are excavating the former Bridges Garage site on Tetbury Road in Cirencester ahead of planned building work in the area. The location would have been known as Corinium at the time of the burial and it was the second largest town in Roman Britain. According to the archaeologists, the inscription on the stone reads: 'DM [Dis Manibus, in the hands of God], Bodica, the wife lived years: 27.' However, an alternative translation is that DIS is plural ('to Gods'), whereas the singular would be DEO; and 'of God' would be DEI. Secondly, MANIBVS is said to be be related to the word MANVS 'hand', but is from MANES, deities thought to represent the souls of the departed. The alternative translation is therefore: 'for the Manes gods' or 'to the Manes gods'. The abbreviation DM, although related to pre-Christan Roman religion was also used on early Chrstian tombstones. Archaeologist Neil Holbrook said: 'As an archaeologist, I always get asked what is the best thing I have ever found; well now I have the answer to that. The 4ft-tall (1.2 metre) and 2ft-wide (0.6 metre) tomb was first spotted on Tuesday night. It was lying face down and its ornate triangle-shaped top suggested to the team that it may be a tombstone. When they lifted it from the ground they found it resting on an adult skull (pictured) said to be the person inscribed on the stone . The stone is thought to date from between the 1st and 3rd centuries and has Roman letters and lines of Latin. Archaeologist Neil Holbrook said he believes it is the only example in Roman Britain of a tombstone that has someone's name on it with their remains underneath . 'We think it is the only example in Roman Britain of a tombstone that has someone's name on it, and then their remains underneath. 'We think this because it seems to have fallen on top of their body. The stone was on top of the skull. This is a really, really rare discovery. 'When we lifted it out, you could have cut the atmosphere with a knife.' Archaeologists from Cotswold Archaeology are excavating the former Bridges Garage site on Tetbury Road in Cirencester (pictured) ahead of planned building work in the area. The location would have been known as Corinium at the time of the burial and it was the second largest town in Roman Britain . The team were called in to investigate the area ahead of work to build a new office block by a wealth management company just after Christmas. They previously uncovered 75 burial sites, as well as a bronze cockerel being cradled by a young boy at the site in 2011, and think the plot was a burial ground for the Roman elite of Cirencester.

They previously uncovered 75 burial sites, as well as a bronze cockerel being cradled by a young girl at the site in 2011, and think the plot was a burial ground for the Roman elite of Cirencester. The child was buried wearing hobnailed . shoes and was accompanied by a pottery feeding vessel, and the remarkable . enamelled bronze figurine of a cockerel. The cockerel is 5-inches tall (12.5cm) and the breast, wings, eyes and ‘comb’ are inlaid with enamel, which now appears blue and green. There is a separately moulded tail plate, also enamelled, with ‘openwork’ decoration. The beak is shown open, in the act of crowing. It is believed that the Romans gave religious significance to the cockerel which was known to be connected with Mercury. Experts . claim it was Mercury, a messenger to the gods, that was also . responsible for conducting newly-deceased souls to the afterlife. Statues of this god, including one in the Corinium Museum, commonly show a cockerel at the base. The association probably stems from Mercury’s role as the messenger to the gods and that of the cockerel as ‘announcer’ of the new dawn. Mercury was also the ‘herdsman for the dead’, guiding newly deceased souls on their passage to the afterlife. It is therefore possible that the cockerel was an offering by a devotee of Mercury and expresses a parent’s particular concern to ensure safe transit of a loved one into the after world. The bronze and enamel cockerel (pictured) was said to have been placed in the grave of the two-year-old Roman girl by her parents, and experts believe it was used to ask the Gods to protect her. They also believe the expensive gift was placed in the grave to ease their daughter's transition into the 'next world' When they lifted it from the ground they discovered it was resting on an adult skull though to be the woman inscribed on the stone. Around 100 tombstones have been found from Roman Britain but this is the best preserved and is the only one thought to mark the person found beneath. Mr Holbrook added: 'We saw the back of the tombstone, but we didn't know of the significance. 'We thought it was something, because of the shape of it, but we couldn't be sure. Experts said the stone is lucky to have survived because Roman tombstones were often taken away and re-purposed in buildings during the Medieval period. A garage was also built on the site (excavation plans shown) in the 1960s and the stone survived being destroyed by a beam laid during construction . 'But [Wednesday] was the amazing moment - that's when we knew it really was something, but it surpassed all our expectations. 'We have the potential to be uncovering one of the biggest finds of archaeology this year.' The stone is thought to date from between the 1st and 3rd centuries and has Roman letters and lines of Latin. The team said it is lucky to have survived intact because Roman tombstones were often taken away and re-purposed in buildings in Cirencester during the the Medieval period. A garage was also built on the site in the 1960s and the stone survived being destroyed by a beam which was laid during construction just a few inches above. 'This stone might have fallen over quite quickly, and was covered over, and that's why it escaped the stone robbers,' Mr Holbrook added. The tombstone and the remains will now be taken away to be analysed and dated by experts. Experts believe the bones belong to a woman called Bodica who died in Roman times . The skeleton was found close to a Roman tombstone in Cirencester, Gloucestershire and is unique . The Latin inscription reads 'In the hands of God, Bodica, the wife lived years: 27' The bones are thought to be 1,800 years old but will be taken away for further examination . The tombstone, pictured, is believed to have been made from Cotswold limestone . Experts very excited by the intricate carving on the tombstone which is highly unusual . The remains were discovered during the excavation of a car park in Cirencester, Gloucestershire . Experts believe that it is highly unlikely that the grave site is that of Queen Bodica .","Tombstone and remains were found in a Roman cemetery in Cirencester .

"Madonna may have suffered a triumphant fall at last night's Brit Awards, but it was Jimmy Carr's jokes that really fell flat. The 42-year-old comedian has come under fire for suggesting that Madonna was taking Hormone Replacement Therapy drugs. Jimmy was invited to present British Video of the Year alongside the American model Karlie Kloss. Scroll down for video . Jimmy Carr has been slammed on Twitter for suggesting that 56-year-old Madonna was using Hormone Replacement Therapy - a treatment to relieve the symptoms of the menopause . After quipping that this was 'the best episode of  CD:UK' he'd ever seen he proceeded to the audience that he had been inside Madonna's dressing room and it was full of drugs. 'I'm so excited about Madonna' he said 'I snuck into her dressing room back stage earlier and there's a lot of drugs back there.' A stunned Karlie then tries to change the subject saying 'anyway.' but the comedian quickly interrupts with: 'But don't worry it's all HRT stuff.' An obviously unimpressed Karlie rolls her eyes and briskly moves on by announcing the nominees for the awards before presenting the award to Simon Cowell on behalf of One Direction. Richard Madeley tweeted his support for Madonna and even gave Jimmy a taste of his own medicine . He later tweeted that he had been impressed by Madonna's recovery after her fall . Madonna suffered a fall after she was dragged by her cape off stage during her performance last night . The comment that suggests that the 56-year-old singer is taking Hormone Repacement Therapy (a treatment that relieves symptoms of the menopause) has since been met with heavy critiscm from Twitter users. Ricahrd Madeley was quick to point out his disgust at the tasteless joke and even went as far as to give Jimmy a taste of his own medicine. He tweeted: 'I like Jimmy Carr but Jesus his HRT/drugs gag about Madonna at The Brits. Unfunny, anti-woman, cheap. Maybe his stand-up relies on Viagra.' Other Twitter users also took to the Internet to express their disgust with the joke . Many agreed that Carr's joke had been a flop . The presenter then added in a later tweet: 'And Madonna's recovery from a really bad fall was the perfect reply. Well done M.' Jimmy didn't just leave a bad taste in Madeley's mouth either with thousands of tweets flooding in criticising the comedian. One user said: 'What's going on with the #Brits this year? So many awkward moments. Bad HRT joke by Jimmy Carr too. Let's have a go at older women shall we?' While another tweeted their support for the singer: 'Madonna had the accident and yet it was @jimmycarr who died on stage at the Brits tonight..' As well as his HRT gag Jimmy made another flop when he attempted to poke fun at gender equality. 'I just think it's crazy in this day and age that we have separate awards and toilets for men and women' said Carr which seemed an equally frosty reception. A lot of the tweets suggested that it was the sexist nature of the joke that was most distasteful . Other's suggested that such a bad joke could even result in the end of Carr's career . Many of the tweets shared a support of Madonna after Carr's jibe .","Jimmy Carr presented British Video of the Year at last night's BRITs .

"If you’ve ever doubted just how impressive the Saturn V rocket that took astronauts to the moon was, this chart should provide a helpful reminder. In total 51 influential rockets are shown in height order on the graph - along with an ice cream truck and human for scale - from throughout the history of human spaceflight. They range from the reliable Soyuz rocket, with a remarkable 954 successful launches under its belt, to the huge Saturn V - which remains the most powerful rocket of all time. Below is an interactive, zoomable version of the chart . The chart was created by Tyler Skrabek, 24, from Calgary, Alberta, Canada - and is also available to buy from Etsy for £15.72 ($24.22). It includes the Black Arrow rocket, which was used from 1969 to 1971, and remains the only orbital launch vehicle ever developed by the UK. Further up the scale we come to the Sputnik rocket, which took the first satellite - Sputnik 1 - into space on 4 October 1957. Further still is the Vostok rocket, which Yuri Gagarin rode on 12 April 1961 to become the first human in space. Nasa’s Space Launch System (Block II) - First launch next decade . Lifting capability: 290,000lbs (130,000kg) Falcon Heavy - First launch this year . 117,000lbs (53,000kg) Space Shuttle - 1981 to 2011 . 53,790lbs (24,000kg) Delta IV Heavy - 2004 to present . 49,740lbs (22,560kg) Ariane 5 - 1996 to present . 44,090lbs (20,000kg) Atlas V - 2004 to present . 40,810lbs (18,510kg) The Antares rocket - which had a catastrophic failure on 28 October 2014 - was slightly larger than the Vostok rocket, but slightly shorter than China’s Long March 2D rocket. Towards the upper end of the scale, the mighty European Ariane V rocket just beats the comparable American Titan IV rocket in size. SpaceX’s successfully Falcon 9 1.0 rocket, meanwhile, was a similar height to the Space Transportation System (STS), which took the Space Shuttle into space. Also seen on the scale is the Russian Space Shuttle clone known as the Buran shuttle, which was launched aboard the Energia rocket. After one unmanned launch, however, the programme was retired in 1988. Unfortunately, the Buran was later destroyed in 2002 when the hanger it was in collapsed. The Delta IV Heavy - currently the world’s most powerful rocket - is also represented, but it is completely dwarfed by the two rockets at the end of the scale. They are the Soviet Union's N1 rocket and the American Saturn V rocket. Both were intended to take astronauts to the moon, but only the latter was successful. The N1 was retired after four failed launches between 1969 and 1972. By 2018 though, another rocket will be added to the top of this scale, when Nasa’s Space Launch System (SLS) vehicle is scheduled to take flight in its initial configuration. Sometime next decade it will be upgraded to enable it to be even more powerful than the Saturn V, and ultimately take astronauts to Mars. The Saturn V rocket, seen here on the launch of Apollo 11 on 16 July 1969, remains the most powerful rocket that has ever flown. It was responsible for all the Apollo flights to the moon, and also launched Nasa's first space station - Skylab - in 1973 . The most reliable rocket to date is arguably the Soyuz, seen here launching with a crew to the ISS on 23 October 2012. It has 954 successful launches under its belt, and continues to be used to take astronauts to the ISS . ‘I've been a fan of rockets for a long time now, their immense size and power are aspects that I find interesting,’ Mr Skrabek told MailOnline. ‘Born as a tool of war, they now help us to live our modern lives in comfort and peace. ‘Even though rockets play a vital role [in space exploration], they aren't something that’s typically newsworthy but they are something that’s interesting to the normal person. ‘This is why I decided to create The Rockets of the World, to show off 51 of the world’s most influential rockets in a way they've never been shown before. ‘Some of these rockets have flown few hundreds of times but in some cases it’s only possible to find a few out-of-focus grainy photos or technical drawings. ‘I wanted to change that and give a full colour look at these long forgotten vehicles as a gift to the engineers who designed them and to help us better remember a small piece our history. ‘Basically, when I looked online I noticed a lack of drawings or images of the more important rockets and wanted to create something so that these vehicles wouldn’t be forgotten. ‘Unlike cars, rockets don’t get the same publicity and what they do for us fades away. A lot of these rockets are interesting but not many [people] know they existed.’","Canadian Tyler Skrabek has created a chart of 51 of the world's most influential rockets .

"The number of Assyrian Christians abducted by the Islamic State in Syria has risen to 220 - far more than was previously feared, according to activists. Militants are said to have rounded up more hostages from a chain of villages along a strategic river in the past three days. After the first abductions on Monday, it was reported that 150 Assyrian Christians were seized after ISIS took control of two communities from Kurdish forces in the northeast province of Hassakeh. Scroll down for video . A Kurdish fighter fires an anti-aircraft weapon from the village of Tel Tawil in the direction of ISIS fighters who have seized more Assyrian Christians in the area . Christian fighters carry their weapons towards a checkpoint after launching an offensive against ISIS since 220 Assyrian hostages were seized . But now the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that ISIS had picked up dozens more hostages from 11 communities near the town of Tal Tamr. The province, which borders Turkey and Iraq, has become the latest battleground in the fight against ISIS in Syria. It is predominantly Kurdish but also has populations of Arabs and predominantly Christian Assyrians and Armenians. ISIS began abducting the Assyrians on Monday, when militants attacked a cluster of villages along the Khabur River, sending thousands of people fleeing to safer areas. Younan Talia, a senior official with the Assyrian Democratic Organisation, said ISIS had raided as many as 33 villages. Assyrian Christians board a bus and flee the town of Tel Tamr in fear after ISIS began the abductions on Monday . Assyrians load their belongings on to a pick-up truck and flee to safety. The province, which borders Turkey and Iraq, has become the latest battleground in the fight against ISIS in Syria . State-run news agency SANA and an Assyrian activist group, the Assyrian Network for Human Rights in Syria, said the group had been moved to the ISIS-controlled city of Shaddadeh. The U.N. Security Council has 'strongly condemned' the abductions and demanded the immediate release of others abducted by ISIS and similar groups. The White House also condemned the attacks, saying the international community is united in its resolve to 'end ISIS depravity.' After the attacks, the jihadists set fire to a church and then installed fighters in the remains of the building, an activist network reported. The US-led coalition fighting ISIS, which has backed Kurdish forces battling the group, then bombed the building on Monday, destroying it and killing ISIS militants inside, said the Syrian Revolution General Commission. The Assyrian village of Abu Tina, pictured, was recently recaptured by ISIS fighters who have declared a self-styled caliphate . It comes after reports yesterday that ISIS were planning to release a video showing the Christian hostages, and threatening to kill them if US-led airstrikes against militants in Syria continued. The kidnappings come as ISIS released a video showing militants beheading 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians in Libya earlier this month. The mass abductions are adding to fears among religious minorities in both Syria and Iraq, who have been repeatedly targeted by the ISIS. The extremists have declared a self-styled caliphate in the regions of both countries that are under their control, killing members of religious minorities, driving others from their homes, enslaving women and destroying houses of worship. The Assyrians are indigenous Christian people who trace their roots back to the ancient Mesopotamians.","Number of Assyrian Christians kidnapped by ISIS in Syrian has risen to 220 .

"Professor David Abulafia, pictured, has warned that the history of Europe is being taught in 'a distorted way' in order to promote the European Union . The history of Europe is being taught to pupils in a ‘distorted’ way in order to promote the EU, a leading British historian has claimed. Professor David Abulafia, of Cambridge University, said the ‘soft push’ for further European integration that had been seen in French and German education was beginning to ‘creep in’ to British classrooms. He joins television historian David Starkey and Professors Richard Shannon and Robert Tombs in launching a campaign, Historians for Britain, calling for a fundamental redrawing of the UK’s relationship with Europe. In total 30 academics have backed the campaign and contributed essays to criticise the concept of a single European identity that underpins the emphasis on further integration. In his essay Professor Abulafia wrote: ‘The search for common roots has not been ignored in Brussels and among its acolytes. School textbooks are issued that attempt to present the history of Europe as a common enterprise. ‘It hardly needs to be said that this has involved a distortion of the past, by assuming that a sense of European identity has existed for centuries, and by assuming a common purpose leading to the ultimate unification of Europe.’ Millions of children across the continent could be being taught a skewed version of history for political purposes, Professor Abulafia feared. ‘There is a soft push to create a sense of European citizenship which is based on frankly an invented common history, because the history of Europe is to a large extent the history of division, not the history of unity,’ he said. ‘When it has been the history of unity, as we’ve seen under Napoleon and Hitler or under the Soviets in Eastern Europe, it has gone disastrously wrong. It is a papering over the discordant elements in European history to create this idealised event.’ The Cambridge academic said the European Union had been presented as a ‘great train’ with the tracks leading to a ‘United States of Europe’ in some textbooks. He raised concerns that children were being misled into believing that ‘European citizenship trumps national allegiance’ and suggests the notion that it is ‘obvious and natural’ to have a fully integrated European state. TV historian David Starkey, pictured, has also joined a movement opposing further EU integration . He added: ‘Attempts to create an artificial notion of ‘Europe’ distract from the reality of the situation and make it harder to rectify the many problems that exist within the EU’s institutions.’ His concerns are shared by other historians, one of whom compared the push for European unity to the tyranny of Joseph Stalin, and another who warned that it undermined principles defended by Sir Winston Churchill. Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain, the campaign backing renegotiation which is affiliated with Historians for Britain, said the idea of a single European identity was ‘dangerous’. He told the Daily Telegraph newspaper: ‘The EU’s official motto is ‘United in diversity’, a laudable philosophy. Unfortunately, many of the EU’s policies seem intent on crushing that diversity, striving to replace Europe’s many historic identities with a single, artificial ‘European’ culture.’","Teachers are promoting a 'soft push' for EU integration during lessons .

"With Nato forces withdrawing from the badlands of Afghanistan, the country's people need all the help they can get to keep extremists from once again seizing power. But it seems a new intervention has come from an unlikely source... outer space. U.S. Marines captured this incredible footage of what looks like a UFO hovering over a Taliban encampment - then blowing it to kingdom come. The cosmic coalition: Huge explosions are seen as an unidentified aircraft bombards a Taliban base in Afghanistan, in this screengrab from a video shot by U.S. Marines fighting in the war-torn country . Fire photon torpedoes! Muzzle flash-like lights can be seen emerging from the underside of the aircraft . Devastating: The huge plumes of smoke from the attack obscure the view of the UFO . The clip was reportedly filmed by U.S. troops fighting in Afghanistan in March. Shot by a soldier standing next to a stationary armoured column, it shows a bizarre triangular object hanging in the sky not far ahead. As soldiers look on, the craft slowly moves into position, before what appear to be muzzle flashes soundlessly emanate from its underside. A split-second later and huge explosions erupt as the fearsome space weapons hit the site of the purported Taliban camp, sending up plumes of smoke that obscure the view of the mysterious bomber. After the smoke clears, the cameraman zooms in to shoot a close up view of the UFO, which looks unlike any known U.S. military drone.

If the unidentified aircraft is from outer space, it has come at the right time for the Westnern-backed government of Afghanistan. Most international troops are slated to withdraw at the end of the year, and there are fears that the Afghan army and police are not ready to take over the job of securing the country. Despite a decade of war since a U.S.-led coalition invaded Afghanistan and toppled the Taliban regime, it remains a crucible of extremism, a place where women have few rights, and a major source for the international heroin trade. But with possible alien intervention, it could be that a new era has finally begun for Afghanistan's embattled people.

"These fascinating photos of one of the most gruelling challenges on Earth were captured by a British volunteer who says Alaska’s unforgiving wilderness provided the perfect break from London life. Emma Watson Mack endured freezing temperatures, whiteout conditions and powerful wind gusts while providing vital support to teams of mushers and huskies in the Iditarod trail sled dog race. Billed as ‘The Last Great Race on Earth’, the annual competition sees some of the world’s best sled dog mushers travel 1,000 miles across Alaska in a treacherous contest that lasts more than a week. Mushers and their dogs travel 1,000 miles across the Alaskan wilderness during the annual Iditarod race . Emma Watson Mack said her volunteer work in Alaska was a welcome break from the stress of London life . Emma provided logistical support to the sled teams as they participated in the long-distance race from Anchorage to Nome. Her snapshots of mushers, dogs and the elements provide an insider’s view of the event, held every year in March since 1973 in temperatures that can plummet to -50 C. The 44-year-old said it offered a welcome break from the pace and stresses of life in London, where she worked as a marketing manager, before moving to Aberdeen. It provided so much inspiration that she one day hopes to become a musher with her own team of dogs. Each husky burns up to 10,000 calories a day on the trail and requires a high-energy food . Emma Watson Mack said her time in Alaska provided so much inspiration that she wants to become a musher . Emma - without her winter kit - is a veteran of the Royal Artillery regiment . She said: ‘The mushers go through months of training, all for one race. It's incredibly tough. The route, which has 26 checkpoints, is 1,000 miles long. ‘The fastest teams complete the course in eight days. That means they cover more than 120 miles a day in extremely punishing conditions.' Some teams take three weeks to get to the finish line. 'There is huge pride to be had in finishing, even if it takes a long time.’ The mushers and their dogs go through months of training for the race, which takes place every March . Emma Watson Mack's photos provide an insider's look at what life is like on the Iditarod trail . The fastest teams complete the course in just eight days, covering more than 120 miles a day . She added: ‘There's a huge sense of competition between the mushers, because they've trained their dogs to such a high level. But there's also a huge amount of respect for each other. They're doing what no one else can.’ It’s especially gruelling for the huskies which pull the sleds across the frozen terrain. Each dog burns up to 10,000 calories a day and requires a high-energy food specifically-designed for the demands of a performance athlete. The competition is so extreme that the mushers suffer from hallucinations. The most common one causes them to dodge and duck tree branches that aren’t even there. Teams endure freezing temperatures, whiteout conditions and powerful wind gusts during the competition . Emma Watson Mack said the mushers are competitive but have a huge amount of respect for each other . The competition is so extreme that the mushers suffer from hallucinations, including phantom trees . Emma, a veteran of the Royal Artillery regiment, said she had dreamed about volunteering in the race for years. She said: ‘After eight years of working in marketing and events management I finally decided to pack my bags and go. ‘Day-to-day life in Alaska took some getting used to. My biggest fear was that I would get stomped on by a moose. On my commute to work they would walk around Anchorage like they owned the place. Fortunately, all of the bears were in hibernation.’ Billed as ‘The Last Great Race on Earth’, the race sees teams race across Alaska, from Anchorage to Nome . Dallas Seavey holds the record for the fastest finish, at eight days, 13 hours, four minutes and 19 seconds . One of her biggest thrills was being asked to usher legendary four-time Iditarod winner Lance Mackey to the starting line. She said: ‘I couldn't believe it when I was asked to work with Lance. Despite losing teeth to throat cancer, and the amputation of his left index finger, he's won the Iditarod time and time again. ‘It was my job to make sure his dogs stopped right at the starting line before they embarked on the race. The dogs were incredibly eager to get going and if they crossed the line, there's no way they would have been able to reverse back.’ ‘I would love to go out there again for the Iditarod trail sled dog race. One day I hope to be a musher myself with my own team of dogs.’ This year’s race, which begins March 7, will include Worcester's Rob Cooke, 48, and his wife, Louise, who will be braving the bitter cold with their main race team.","Emma Watson Mack provided logistical support to mushers and dogs .

"A man charged with carjacking is seeking more than $1 million in a lawsuit against police officers who were caught on video beating him. The video, captured by a resident from inside her Grosse Pointe home, shows one male officer apparently punching Andrew Jackson Jr. while he is handcuffed, before another kicks him in the side. Jackson Jr., 51, is claiming for injuries as well as emotional distress during the arrest in Detroit on January 12. His lawsuit was moved to federal court Monday from Wayne County court. Violent: A police officer climbs on a carjacking suspect and punches him while another officer delivers blow to his side. The footage, pictured above, was captured by a woman in a nearby house . The footage shows cops brutally beating a handcuffed suspect in the street - before two officers gave each other a celebratory fist bump. At one point, Jackson, a suspect in an earlier carjacking, calls out for Jesus. 'What did you say?' asks one of the officers, who then kneels on the man back. 'Jesus? You're calling Jesus? Don't you dare. Don't you f***ing dare!' Scroll down for video . Job well done: Another officer, left, then arrives on the scene and fist bumps her fellow officer over the man . After the initial burst of violence, the man stays quiet on the ground and a female officer approaches and fist bumps one of the male officers. 'They're tapping each other, talking about a good job,' says the woman behind the camera, Emma Craig. She later shared the footage to her Facebook page. After the incident, Grosse Pointe Park police issued a statement saying that Jackson had allegedly pointed a gun at a mother and her two children, forcing them out of their car and stealing it. Police tracked the vehicle and took chase, before the suspect got out of the car and fled about a quarter of a mile on foot. Officers then caught up with him and tried to Tase him but it failed to work so they had to use force to take him into custody and remove his weapon, police said in a statement. In custody: The suspect, Andrew Jackson Jr., 51, allegedly stole a car at gunpoint on Monday . Jackson had absconded his parole from April 2014 when he missed a meeting with his parole officer and moved address, police said. Records show he was convicted in 2004 of conspiracy to commit armed robbery, assault with intent to rob while armed and fleeing a police officer, the Detroit News reported. In the footage, the officers can be heard discovering a gun on the man after the arrest. Ron Craig, whose mother shot the footage, told the Detroit News there was no justification for the violence used against Jackson. 'He was in handcuffs,' Craig said. 'You had him captured. He was no threat.' He added: 'It's not a race issue, it's a humanitarian issue.' Shortly after the incident, demonstrators from the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality gathered outside the Grosse Pointe Police station to call for prosecution of the officers involved. Coalition director Ron Scott said the group believed 'the officers' actions, once the suspect was handcuffed, were not justified'. Grosse Pointe Police Sergeant Jeff Longo briefly addressed the protesters to say that Chief David Hiller had no comment for them and that an investigation is under way. Hiller previously said officers' actions were appropriate considering the sequence of events. Demands: Ron Scott speaks at rally in front of the Grosse Pointe Park city offices as he and other protesters called for the prosecution of the two officers seen beating Jackson in the video . 'We're looking at it, and we believe the officers actions were proper,' he said. 'In effecting the arrest, they had to kick to get his arms free because he was going for his gun, which was in his waistband.' Michigan State Police investigated the incident after being contacted by Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy, who said she would be 'actively monitoring' the investigation. The Wayne County Prosecutor's Office will now decide whether to file charges against the officers. Meanwhile, Jackson — an ex-convict who was released from prison in 2013 — returns to court on March 3 to see if he will face trial on the carjacking charge. He is accused of robbing a 55-year-old woman who was cleaning snow off of her car and threatening to shoot her grandchildren.","Footage shows two cops punching and kicking a man they were arresting .

"The Princess Royal has paid tribute to the men and women of the Special Operations Executive, the forerunner to MI6. She joined veterans for a glittering gala dinner at London's Natural History Museum, part of which was used to train agents during the Second World War. Resplendent in a floor-length ivory gown, Anne, who has spent the last week criss-crossing the UK on behalf of her charities, was on cheerful form as she arrived. Royal salute: The Princess Royal paid tribute to the heroes of the Special Operations Executive last night . It was held to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the SOE, which sent agents into France and other occupied nations, among them Denmark and the Netherlands, during the war years. Many of the recruits sent in were female, although tragically, of the 55 to join, 13 were killed in action or died in Nazi concentration camps. One of the most famous was Violette Szabo, the daughter of an English father and French mother, who was just 23 when she was executed by the Nazis at Ravensbrück concentration camp. Before she was captured and killed, however, she completed two operations in occupied France, arriving for the first on a flight from RAF Tempsford in Bedfordshire in a US B-24 Liberator bomber. Big event: The  reception at the National History Museum was held to mark the 75th anniversary of the SOE . Important work: During World War II, hundreds of SOE agents were parachuted into occupied Europe . Although she returned home that time, she was less lucky and was captured by the Nazis while attempting to coordinate French Resistance efforts to aid the D-Day Landings. On the 5th February 1945, as the Allied Armies closed in on Germany, she was executed with a single shot to the back of the head. Her efforts, and those of many more SOE agents, were honoured during the event, which was conducted in the presence of a number of veterans, as well as the Princess Royal. And she wasn't the only royal on hand to mark the efforts of the SOE. Also in London for the event was Norway's Crown Prince Haakon, who accompanied five Norwegian veterans. On her way: Anne, who has spent the week criss-crossing the UK, made a swift exit after the event . Brave: SOE's Violette Szabo, pictured with her daughter Tania, was executed by the Nazis at Ravensbruck . Important: During the Second World War,  agents provided vital intelligence and helped sabotage the Nazis . The veterans, all of whom were part of the Norwegian Resistance as well as the SOE, had been taken to visit the Churchill War Rooms earlier that day. Led by Joachim Rønneberg, who was behind their successful attack on the Vemork hydroelectric power plant in 1943, the men toured the museum before briefly taking a seat in Churchill's chair. Their wartime efforts proved particularly useful, given that the plant they attacked produced heavy water - a substance needed for making nuclear weaponry. Thanks to the five men, the Germans were never able to take over the plant - and the Nazis never got their hands on a nuclear bomb.","The Princess Royal joined veterans at the National History Museum .

"Coutts –the Queen’s bank owned by RBS - is being investigated by German prosecutors over allegations it helped wealthy clients evade tax in Swiss bank accounts. The disclosure in RBS's annual results comes as HSBC is mired in controversy over similar claims, with criminal investigations launched in several countries including Switzerland and France. RBS gave only scant details but said the investigation by German prosecutors into Coutts’ Swiss private banking arm involved current and former staff as well as the Coutts bank itself. Coutts is being investigated by German prosecutors over claims it helped wealthy clients avoid paying tax . It is already being investigated by the US Department of Justice, and said it expects to reach a settlement later this year. RBS chief executive Ross McEwan said the growing tax dodging scandal has ‘tarnished the banking industry’, adding that ‘private banks have taken too long to catch up with public expectations’. He added: ‘I want to be very clear, if we find any evidence on wrongdoing we will come down incredibly hard. It’s just not the type of behaviour we’ll have in our organisation.’ RBS is looking to sell the international arm of Coutts to focus on its wealthy UK clients. The reputation of Coutts, whose well-heeled client list includes the Queen, is already tarnished. It was fined almost £9million for laundering money for suspected criminals and foreign despots by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority in 2012. It has also been forced to set aside millions of pounds to compensate UK customers mis-sold investments. RBS chief executive Ross McEwan, pictured, warned that tax dodging scandals are 'tarnishing the industry'","Coutts is being investigated over claims it helped rich clients evade tax .

"The isolated U.S. military silo that contains one of deadliest nuclear arsenals in the world - some 450 warheads that are each 20 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima - is being controlled by computers dating back to 1960s and a launch system that relies on floppy disks. But security officials maintain their methods are not only functional but hack-free, with the underground control room in Wyoming not connected to the internet, stopping any cyber terrorists gaining control over the weapons. 60 Minutes gained access to the F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne and will broadcast its full report from the facility tonight. CBS Correspondent Lesley Stahl said she believed the unprecedented invitation to take a look inside was part of a move by the military to show the public their system was safe in the wake of a widespread cheating scandal among their ranks. Scroll down for video . Haven't seen one of them in a while: An underground missile control center in Wyoming that is launch facility of the LGM-30G Minuteman-III - the only land-based ICBM in service in the United States - uses primitive computers that date back to the 1960s, including floppy disks . Rudimentary: While the computers and equipment at the missile control center are aging, they not connected to the outside world - the internet - which prevents the weapons being hijacked . 60 Minutes reporter Leslie Stahl tours the F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, Wyoming, as part of a report on missile operations . The control center computer systems, which manage the launch of some of America's and the world's - most power nuclear weapons, date back to the 1960s when the facility was built . Four Air Force nuclear missile officers were found to be at the center of the still-unfolding scandal, with nine officers were fired at the 341st Missile Wing at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana, and 82 others facing disciplinary action after being caught cheating on proficiency tests. The officers need to get 100 percent on the exams in order to work at facilities, such as the one in Cheyenne. The four 'librarians', as they have been dubbed, allegedly faciliated the cheating, in part by transmitting test answers via text message. Major General Jack Weinstein, the new commander of the missile corps, told 60 Minutes of his efforts to make improvements following the disaster. Outside of the cheating, the underground centers are in desperate need of an upgrade. The silos were built in the 1960s and are designed to survive a nuclear attack. Most of the communications systems are analog, built to receive launch orders from the president in time of war. But even the phones are primitive and constantly have connection problems. 'They're awful,' one officer said about the phones. 'You can't hear the other person on the other end of the line. The isolated facility in Cheyenne, Wyoming, looks like a small ranch from above, but underneath is a vast silio containing 450 live nuclear warheads . The LGM-30G Minuteman III missile  is the only land-based ICBM in service in the United States . 'Sometimes you can't dial out, which makes it very difficult if you're trying to do your job.' Gen. Weinstein told Stahl the Air Force was 'looking at upgrading' the phones 'in the next few years'. Other aging equipment include a reinforced door that is meant to protect the entrance to the control center, but that hasn't worked for years because of a broken part, according to CBS News. The Air Force has pledged to spend $19 million this year to improve launch control centers and missile silos. Another $600 million next year is hoping to help with more extensive improvements. Capt. Lauren Choate, a Minuteman 3 missile launch officer, works at the console of a launch simulator used for training at F. E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyo. An Air Force officer adjusts the launch knob for a missile at the F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming . The land-based Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) - the focus of the 60 Minutes story - make up one part of a  'nuclear triad' tasked with storing the weapons of the United States, which also includes submarines and bombers. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated it will cost $355 billion over the next 10 years to maintain and upgrade all three legs of the triad. Some analysts contend the U.S. can live without the land-based missiles, because their positions are known to our enemies and once launched, they cannot be recalled.","60 Minutes received a tour of the F.E.

"Spain is launching a crackdown on drunk tourists and is considering introducing breathalyser tests for pedestrians in a bid to make their streets safer. The proposals, suggested by the country's Directorate General of Traffic, are intended to stop visitors to the country from staggering into the path of oncoming cars after they've been drinking. Anybody stopped by police officers on Spanish streets could be asked to take a breathalyser or drugs test if they are believed to be implicated in a road traffic accident. Tourists walking down the famous La Rambla street in Barcelona. Under new proposals police in Spain could breathalyse pedestrians in a bid to crackdown on drunk tourists . The proposals would also re-class pedestrians as road users, who have the same responsibility to keep safe as drivers. But according to the Guardian, the plan has been criticised by several members of the Spanish government because there hasn't been a limit imposed on what constitutes as too much alcohol. Concerns have also been raised that it would breach privacy and freedom of people in the country. But the traffic directorate insist that police can already carry out alcohol and drugs tests on pedestrians, who are thought to have broken the law. Maria Segui Gomes, the organisation's director, said: 'Municipal police have been carrying out these tests for months – there is nothing new here that will allow us to start sanctioning pedestrians, whether economically or with penalty points.' The Traffic Directorate insist that police can already carry out alcohol and drugs tests on pedestrians who are thought to have broken the law (file picture) Other plans by the organisation have also included imposing speed limits on joggers and the possibility of fining people who leave the house without glasses, or wearing dark clothing at night. In a 2011 study published in the Journal of Trauma, it found that 55 per cent of walkers under the influence of alcohol ignored pedestrian crossings, compared to just 22 per cent of sober ones. In conclusion the research also urged traffic safety and injury prevention programmes to address irresponsible alcohol use in pedestrians. Meanwhile a study last year in the UK found that one pedestrian in seven injured on the roads in Britain is drunk at the time. Figures from the Department of Transport reveal more than 6,000 intoxicated pedestrians have been injured since 2011.","Proposals by Spain's Traffic Directorate are a bid to make the streets safer .

"A jealous boyfriend was left to murder his own six-month-old baby, ex-girlfriend and her mother in an arson attack after police failed to investigate his 'escalating' behaviour, a report has found. Triple killer Carl Mills sent his girlfriend Kayleigh Buckley, 17, threatening texts and said he would 'burn her house down', but officers did not arrest him despite complaints from her family. Just 20 days after the family reported criminal damage at their Cwmbran home, the 17-year-old was killed along with her baby Kimberley and mother Kim, 46, in a house fire  as they slept. Carl Mills, 31, was jailed for a minimum of 35 years in 2013 for the three murders after the arson attack in September 2012. Carl Mills (left) was left to murder his own six-month-old baby, ex-girlfriend Kayleigh Buckley, 17, (pictured) and her mother in an arson attack, a report found . An investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission found the police handling of the family's complaints 'fell well short of the standard expected'. The report also said Gwent Police's checks on triple killer's background were 'inadequate' and standards of 'good practice' were not met. Both the PC and acting sergeant have been disciplined for failing to handle a complaint from Kim Buckley that Mills had damaged their home at Cwmbran, South Wales. The review found Mills, from Bolton, was involved in 45 incidents of violence committed against his mother Dawn Mills. The IPCC report said: 'On 29 August 2012, Kim Buckley attended Cwmbran police station to report criminal damage at her home and alleged that Mr Mills, her daughter's boyfriend, was responsible. 'A police constable took a statement and, along with a temporary police sergeant, took responsibility for dealing with the allegation. The 17-year-old (right) was killed in a house fire along with her baby Kimberley (pictured) and mother Kim (left) The court heard Mills started the fire in the porchway of the three-bed house, blocking the exit . 'The IPCC investigation found that the allegation of criminal damage was not acted upon and that potential lines of enquiry were not followed. 'In relation to the police constable, the investigation found the officer did not identify, or act on, Mr Mills' escalating behaviour including text messages that threatened harm, and his actual criminal acts of theft. 'The constable did not interrogate available databases or contact Social Services. The acting sergeant failed to intrusively supervise the constable to check that investigatory tasks had been carried out.' The murder trial at Newport Crown Court heard how Mills bombarded his former partner Kayleigh with threatening texts and warned her: 'I will burn your house down.' Mills torched the family home in September 2012 - on the day his prematurely-born baby daughter came home from hospital after spending her first six months in a neo-natal unit. Mills torched the family home in September 2012 - on the day his prematurely-born baby daughter came home from hospital after spending her first six months in a neo-natal unit . Just 20 days before the arson attack, Mills had 'trashed' the family home while baby Kimberley was still in hospital, pictured is fire damage at the home in Cwmbran, South Wales . The obsessive boyfriend was living in a tent near the family home in Cwmbran and had been banned from seeing his child unsupervised. In the wake of the killings and Mills's trial at Newport Crown Court, three reports were ordered - a Serious Case Review (SCR), a Domestic Homicide Review (DHR) and an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). All three have been released and Gwent Police has been criticised for failing to find out about Mills' background. In his review for the South East Wales Safeguarding Children Board barrister David Spicer said: 'It is rarely possible to assert that had matters been handled differently the serious incident that has led to the deaths of children would not have occurred. 'But if the information available in Bolton concerning Mills' history had been properly researched and considered, and appropriate interagency processes and planning had taken place, the risks would have been better understood and it is likely that action would have been taken that was more likely to protect the family from the extreme act which caused their deaths.' The pair met on Facebook in 2010 when she was 15 and within months the killer, then 26, moved to Cwmbran. Ms Buckley got police and social services involved because she was concerned about their relationship given her daughter's age. But once Kayleigh turned 16 social workers and police stopped treating her as a child at risk of abuse but as a 'young person making bad choices'. Mills repeatedly threatened to murder Kayleigh and their baby and burn down the house . Mills, 31, was jailed for a minimum of 35 years in 2013 for the three murders after the arson attack . Mr Spicer said child protection staff knew Mills was grooming Kayleigh but failed to treat it as child sexual exploitation. Mills repeatedly threatened to murder Kayleigh and their baby and burn down the house. He sent a barrage of abusive texts to her in the days before the blaze. The review found references in records that describe the abuse play down its seriousness, 'normalise' what was happening and 'allocated an inappropriate level of responsibility to the victim'. Mills, who had previously ignored court-ordered psychiatric treatment, attacked the home because he wrongly believed Kayleigh was in a relationship with another man. The review found the volume of information coming to Gwent Police from checks caused difficulties with 'administering the collection of data'. A local decision was made to 'switch off' the data, which then became irretrievable. The review, which makes numerous recommendations to tighten procedures, has not been able to establish who made the decision. A retired senior officer who was contacted did not reply to a letter or take part in the review. He sent a barrage of abusive texts to her in the days before the blaze, pictured are the flames coming out of the house on the night of the arson attack .

"A homeless college football player is no longer on Baylor's team after a family friend gave the young man a place to stay. Silas Nacita, a running back and junior at the Texas school, said on Twitter that he was 'no longer eligible to play football and pursue my dream'. He wrote that the friend from his home in Bakersfield, California, got him an apartment in Texas because he 'didn't want me sleeping on floors and wondering how I was going to eat the next meal'. Scroll down for video . Silas Nacita, from Bakersfield, California, said he was no longer eligible to play football at Baylor University because he accepted housing from a family friend . He said the friend, 'insisted' on helping him out with living expenses. The NCAA said that it 'did not declare Silas Nacita ineligible and Baylor has not requested a waiver for him'. Baylor had no option but to kick him off the team after he chose not to pursue university and NCAA-offered ways of finding housing and lived with the family friend, according to Baylor fan website BearsTruth. Baylor confirmed that Mr Nacita 'will not be a part of the football program moving forward due to rules violations that impact his eligibility'. After a day of observers' fury and frustration over why the young man would not be able to play football, he followed up on his Twitter post by saying that he takes 'full responsibility' for his actions and 'inappropriate benefits'. Speaking of accepting housing, Mr Nacita said: 'The bottom line is that I broke the rules. I should've never accepted the help and I am deeply sorry for my actions.' He said 'now I see I made a mistake disregarding guidance from Baylor compliance on what benefits I can receive.' The young man was homeless for the end of high school and slept on friend's couches while saving money and attending community college, . Under NCAA rules it is illegal for students to accept money or gifts related to their athletic performances. The university's football coach Art Briles said: 'If he's eligible, he'll be back. This is out of our control, it isn't our problem with him' according to Sports Illustrated. Mr Nacita, from Bakersfield, California, became homeless his senior year of high school after clashing with his mother following the death of his father when he was 16. He played football as a freshman for the Ivy League's Cornell in 2012. He later transferred to Baylor, but was unable to enroll immediately because he could not get a loan. The young man  spent his time before enrolling taking community college classes online and sleeping on friends' floors while waiting tables at restaurant chain Cheddar's. The running back eventually received a financial aid package and scholarship from Baylor, though did not pursue the recommended avenues of finding housing . His mother and he  reconciled after he hitchhiked from Texas to California following a tough shift at work. Without an athletic scholarship, he eventually received a financial aid package and scholarship, but did not receive money for books and would snap pictures of pages of his texts in the store to avoid having to purchase them. The running back did not participate in a spring practice on Tuesday, according to ESPN. He earned All-Academic Big 12 honors last year in addition to rushing for 191 yards. Earlier this week Mr Nacita had posted photos saying how excited he was to wear Baylor's new uniforms in the fall. He said Thursday: 'I would like to get back to my studies so that I'm not paying off these student loans when I'm 50.'

"Former Silverchair frontman Daniel Johns has apologised for blowing more than twice the legal limit in his black Jaguar after he was fined and had his licence disqualified for drink driving. Johns appeared in Newcastle Local Court on Thursday after he pleaded guilty to the offence in November last year. He was fined $880 and disqualified from driving until June 4 by the magistrate, the Newcastle Herald reported. Scroll down for video . Singer Daniel Johns was fined $880 and had his licence disqualified after he was sentenced at Newcastle Local Court . Outside court, Johns told reporters the incident would 'never happen again' and he had completed a traffic offenders program. 'I made a mistake, for which I am really sorry,' the Australian singer said in his usual quiet tones. While handing down his sentence, the magistrate told Johns he would have known he was over the limit when he got behind the wheel on October 28 unless he was a 'hardened drinker'. The court heard the musician had bloodshot eyes and smelled of alcohol when police pulled him over on Morgan Street in Merewether while he driving between 70km/h and 80km/h. The speed limit for the area was 50km/h. Johns, 35, blew 2.5 times over the legal limit and told police he had consumed four large glasses of wine over a three and a half hour period . Speaking outside the court room Johns apologised for the incident and said he regrets driving under the influence . He informed officers he had drunk four large glasses of wine over a three and a half hour period before getting behind the wheel. His licence was suspended and he was taken into custody by police at the scene after blowing a reading of 0.126, according to NBN News. 'In the opinion of police the accused was moderately affected by intoxicating liquor when he was stopped by police,' court documents said as reported by The Daily Telegraph. 'His eyes were watery, bloodshot and he smelt heavily of intoxicating liquor.' Speaking to NBN outside of the local courtroom after his earlier appearance in November, Johns said he regretted driving under the influence. 'I just made a mistake that I regret and luckily no one got hurt,' he said. 'I definitely won't do it again.' The musician, who is now dating fashionista Estelita Huijer (pictured right), said the incident would 'never happen again' Johns was married to fellow Australian singer Natalie Imbruglia for two years, but according to his ex-wife they no longer have contact . Johns' former wife, Australian singer Natalie Imbruglia, revealed last year she no longer speaks to the musician. 'We no longer speak but I have no regrets and it was a very happy time of my life', she told The Joyce earlier this month. 'I've learned that it's ok to make mistakes as long as you learn from them. The break-down of my marriage showed me that you cannot control the outcome of things.' The couple divorced in 2008 after two years of marriage. Following that, Johns dated model Louise Van der Vorst for just over four years. The singer, who is rarely photographed in public, has now been dating fashionista Estelita Huijer for over a year, with the two first being spotted together last May. Though Silverchair have not released an album since 2007, an image of Johns working on new music was posted on Huijer's Instagram earlier this year. He also collaborated on a song titled Impossible with rapper 360 in January. Johns burst onto the music scene at the tender age of 12 when he formed the rock band Innocent Criminals with his two pals, Ben Gillies and Chris Joannou. The group got their big break in 1994 when they won an Australian demo competition, and after signing with record label Murmur they changed their name to Silverchair. During their successful time together, the band produced five studio albums, including Frogstomp (1995), Freak Show (1997), Neon Ballroom (1999), Diorama (2002) and Young Modern (2007). They also won a whopping 21 ARIA awards. In 2011, the band announced their indefinite hiatus on their website in the form of a statement. 'We formed Silverchair nearly 20 years ago when we were just 12 years old,' it read. 'Today we stand by the same rules now as we did back then ... if the band stops being fun and if it's no longer fulfilling creatively, then we need to stop. 'Despite our best efforts over the last year or so, it's become increasingly clear that the spark simply isn't there between the three of us at the moment.

"Grandparents who took over raising their grandchild when she was aged four after discovering she had been subjected to horrific abuse have shared their story. Evelyn and Ralph, from Manchester, who are in their fifties, took in their granddaughter, Melissa, (all names changed to protect the child's identity) after she was born into a violent relationship. The couple explained how they knew Melissa's mother Steph - their daughter - was a victim of domestic abuse but their attempts to get her to leave her violent partner always failed. Melissa, now nine, (not pictured to protect her identity, file photo shown) was neglected and abused during her first four years before going to live with her grandparents . Ralph explained: 'Melissa's mother Steph suffered from domestic violence when she was pregnant with Melissa and would come and stay with us after each assault. Sometimes we'd have to take her to hospital because she'd be bleeding so much. 'From the moment Melissa was born, Steph was emotionless, it was clear to us that she was having difficulties being a mum. Steph would scream and shout if Melissa cried and refused to take Melissa out in a pram for a walk. Steph hated the crying. She never hit Melissa, but she would hit herself because she was upset. 'When Melissa was six-weeks-old Steph went back to live with her partner again. We worried about Melissa all the time because we'd seen the first six weeks and thought that Steph needed support being a new mum. 'The following months and years Steph and her partner continued to fall out and fight and Steph would come back and stay with us with Melissa but she always went back to him.' However, the couple admitted they didn't know quite how bad things had got in Steph's home until Melissa finally went to live with them full-time when she was four. Ralph said: 'Melissa was so timid and scared. She had dog bite marks on the backs of her legs but Steph couldn't explain any of this. We had logged our concerns repeatedly with Children's Services but little was done to protect Melissa.' They were shocked by how little Melissa had been taught and how she was constantly frightened and confused. Ralph said: 'Steph and her partner had never spent any time trying to teach Melissa things or helping her learn. When Melissa came to live with us she couldn't speak very well or use a knife and fork. What language she had was littered with swear words. She wouldn't go outside in the garden to play because she'd never been allowed to play out before. 'She would follow us around the house and didn't like being away from us. When we took her to places she didn't know she would vomit or wet herself with stress. 'Melissa had been shouted at every day. She had seen self-harm every day. She was severely neglected. She had seen animals beaten and killed.' As if this wasn't shocking enough, the grandparents then learnt from Melissa that she had been sexually abused. 'We found out that she regularly saw people having sex and then we discovered she had been sexually abused,' Ralph said. 'We allowed Melissa to visit her mum to go on holiday when she was four years old. When she came back she described an incident which had happened on holiday with a family friend which we realised was a sexual assault. Her abuser was a teenager, approximately 17 at the time. 'He admitted it to the family, but they didn't take it seriously. He was told not to do it again and that was it. We later found out that there had been multiple assaults over a period of time.' Evelyn added: 'After disclosing the abuse Melissa had trouble sleeping, would have nightmares and became quite scared. She was like a newborn baby and refused to be left alone. When I was cooking she was clinging to my leg. I couldn't go to the toilet or shower alone. She didn't like sleeping alone and would share a bed with me or sleep on a camp bed in our room rather than be on her own. 'She found certain toys really scary to play with and wouldn't watch her old favourite programmes. She didn't understand what had happened but she knew it had scared her. 'Melissa became really secretive about her body and wouldn't let us wash her or clean her. I overheard her playing with her dolls one day where one doll was saying to the other ""open your legs I'm not going to hurt you."" Little by little she was describing the horrific things she'd been subjected to.' The grandparents said it has been a long and difficult road to recovery to help the little girl put her past behind her. The NSPCC's 'Letting the Future In' programme helps young victims of sexual abuse deal with their pasts and move on with their lives so they can reclaim a happy childhood (pictured posed by model) Now aged nine, the grandparents said Melissa's confidence and happiness has gradually improved after numerous courses they were referred to by Children's Services. But they said the real breakthough came after they sought help from children's charity NSPCC and their 'Letting the Future In' programme which supports the young victims of sexual abuse and their families. Evelyn said: 'The NSPCC was the first organisation that took a combined approach to dealing with Melissa's sexual abuse and did the work with us and Melissa in the same building but in different rooms. It's exactly what we needed.' Thanks to the programme, the couple said they have seen a remarkable change in Melissa's character and confidence. 'She's finally making friends and living a normal childhood,' said Evelyn. 'She's joined a local Brownie Guide group and is enjoying herself. She's doing things we couldn't even comprehend this time last year. The turnaround has been amazing. 'We've broken through to Melissa now and unlocked the little girl she was meant to be. She still has the memories of the abuse and neglect, but now we're replacing them with happy memories.' NSPCC practitioner Caroline, who worked with Melissa, agreed that the little girl has transformed for the better in recent months. She said: 'When I first started working with Melissa she wouldn't give me any eye contact, she was constantly looking to her grandma for reassurance. When I first met her she didn't know how to laugh, she was permanently scowling, fearful and nervous. When we were playing in the play room, she didn't want to play with me, she wanted to play by herself. 'Melissa wasn't showing behaviour that was appropriate to her age; she was acting a lot younger than she was. A lot of her behaviour was like that of a pre-school child, both emotionally and how she was reacting to things. Melissa was unable to make or maintain friendships at school and was very reliant on the adults around her. 'I think the breakthrough came when had some joint sessions with Ralph and Evelyn together with Melissa. Melissa wanted to play in the sand tray with some figures. She told a story through the figures about her old family who were dangerous and negative and her new family who were loving and safe. Through her play she showed that she was defending herself from her old family and protecting herself with her new family. It was very moving. 'Another time she had figures acting as her and her mum and played out a conversation between them where Melissa asked her mum to apologise for what had happened to her and she did. She then joined her figure to Evelyn and Ralph and her new family and they had a party. 'Since doing the Letting the Future In programme Melissa's social behaviour has become a lot more age appropriate, and although she still needs some adult support in lessons, she's understanding and learning a lot more than she has done in the past. She's grown up and feels ready to play with children her own age and have fun. Now she laughs and is a happy child.'

"All schools should put pupils in sets based on ability, David Cameron said last night in an apparent hint at future Tory education policy. His comments go much further than Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, who last year denied reports that the party wants compulsory setting in all secondary schools. Mr Cameron has long been an enthusiast for setting, but his ambition has been thwarted by parts of the educational establishment and by the Liberal Democrats. Learning: All schools should put pupils in sets based on their ability, David Cameron said (posed by models) Some Tories are also concerned at the idea of imposing compulsory rules on academy schools, which are run on the principle that they are free from state control. In an interview with Woman & Home magazine, the Prime Minister said: ‘All schools, in my view, should set by ability, particularly in English and maths.’ His comments will cheer traditionalists and millions of parents but not teaching unions, which believe that setting can be elitist. Last autumn the Tories announced plans to allow setting to be imposed to help turn around failing schools. Although Mr Cameron’s comments suggest he wants to go considerably further, a senior Tory source insisted he was not announcing new policy. However, he confirmed the Prime Minister’s concern at standards in thousands of ‘coasting’ schools. Views: David Cameron supports school setting, but his plans have previously been thwarted . The source said: ‘As his comments suggest, the Prime Minister is a very strong supporter of setting – it’s about placing children with others of similar ability so that they can learn at the right pace. ‘Where a school is failing we think it is right that part of the toolkit for putting things right should include bringing in setting. ‘The vast majority of schools already set in core subjects, and if there is a successful school doing very well without setting then we would not impose it – we want to take a pragmatic approach. 'Our focus is on schools that are failing parents and pupils, and the Prime Minister has also spoken about the need to improve standards at schools that are coasting.’ Mrs Morgan, who replaced Michael Gove as education secretary last year, stamped on reports last September that the Tories back the idea of compulsory setting. Reports claimed that the Tories would attempt to introduce setting in all secondary schools, with the policy enforced by Ofsted. Mrs Morgan said there was ‘absolutely no truth in these rumours’. Setting is backed by Ofsted’s chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw, who said in 2012 that bright teenagers fail to achieve top grades in some comprehensives because teachers insist on mixed-ability classes and concentrate on weaker students. Sir Michael said gifted children were being held back in some schools that do not allow setting to stretch their best pupils. He said mixed-ability classes, which became fashionable following the introduction of comprehensive schools, could be a ‘curse’ to able children. But the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, has described the idea of compulsory setting as ‘educationally unjustifiable’, saying it is the ‘last thing’ ministers should do if they want to close the attainment gap between rich children and poor. The union said: ‘The evidence is overwhelming that this practice holds back poor children, denying them access to an appropriately demanding curriculum.’ Under the existing Tory plans, announced last autumn, regional schools commissioners would be given new powers to impose setting in failing schools as part of a package to turn them around.","PM's comments go further than view of his own Education Secretary .

"A former star of reality show 'Ice Road Truckers' was sentenced to five to 15 years in prison on Tuesday for kidnapping a Las Vegas prostitute who goes by the name 'Snow White'. Timothy R. Zickuhr, who appeared on season two of the History Channel show 'Ice Road Truckers-Deadliest Roads', pleaded guilty to two felony charges of first degree kidnapping and extortionate collection of debt. He has since also been linked to the robbery of an 80-year-old woman. A biography for Zickuhr that remains on the History Channel's website for the reality show described him as a loudmouthed driver, 'brimming with personality.' Scroll down for video . Timothy Zickuhr, who appeared on season two of the History Channel's reality show 'IRT Deadliest Roads', has been sentenced to 5 to 15 years  in prison for kidnapping and threatening a prostitute he said owed him money . Head bowed in court, Zickuhr kidnapped Lisa Cadeau, professionally known as 'Snow White', tied her up, poured ice water over her and beat her . The criminal complaint against Zickuhr claimed that in December 2013, he demanded that Snow White, real name Lisa Cadeau, pay him $1,000. He had given her his ATM card to retrieve cash to pay herself for sexual services. He claimed she had taken too much money from his account. She agreed to meet him again to settle the dispute and when she did he punched her and threatened to kill her. According to the filing, Zickuhr held Cadeau hostage, tied her up with backpack straps, poured ice-cold water over her from a bucket and beat her. When Zickuhr asked her to give him the phone number of someone who would pay him what he was owed, the woman instead gave him the number for a Las Vegas police officer, Adam Seely, to whom she had provided information to in the past, according to the complaint and the officer's report. He called the number and, not knowing he was speaking to a police officer, said that if he didn't get the money he was going to go to Mexico and kill Snow White. He made two more calls to the officer and it was arranged that they would meet at a phone booth behind the Eureka casino. Having heard a woman screaming, Zickuhr's neighbors called the police and he reportedly made Cadeau jump from a second-floor window onto a carport to avoid police detection. They walked to the Eureka where officers were waiting to make an arrest, which they did after a brief foot chase. In his appearance on 'IRT Deadliest Roads' in 2011 Zickuhr  was sent to drive cargo across some of the scariest roads in Bolivia. The show went off the air after that season . In addition to today's sentencing, Zikuhr is expected to be sentenced on an unrelated felony robbery charge on March 9 in Clark County . When he was taken into custody, Zickuhr admitted that he had made a mistake and went on to say that he had planned to place the woman on Craigslist and prostitute her for his financial benefit, The Las Vegas Sun reported in April. Zickuhr joined the History Channel show in its second season, which filmed in 2011, and was sent to drive cargo across some of the scariest roads in Bolivia. The show went off the air after that season and he has since returned to the United States. It was in Las Vegas on the night of December 18, 2013, when he had a tryst with Snow White. Zickuhr is expected to be sentenced on an unrelated felony robbery charge on March 9 in Clark County. In that case, to which he was linked by DNA, he allegedly knocked an 80-year-old woman to the ground outside the Palms Casino, fracturing her left femur and tearing her rotator cuff, the Las Vegas Review Journal reports. He then yanked a fanny pack from her hip and tried to flee so quickly that he ran out of his flip flops, which police then collected and used to identify him.","Timothy Zickuhr, who appeared in a season of Ice Road Truckers, was sentenced to five to 15 years for kidnapping a Las Vegas prostitute .

"Chris Kyle's brother on Thursday said he wishes 'idiot' killer Eddie Ray Routh had faced the death penalty  - but that he could not bear to prolong the agony of the trial. 'Of course I'd like the guy dead right now,' Jeff Kyle said as he appeared on Fox & Friends two days after Routh was found guilty of murdering the famed U.S. Navy SEAL and his friend in 2013. 'From what we understand, we'd still be going through the trial right now. We'd probably still be going through the jury selection if they'd been going for the death penalty.' Prosecutors had not sought the death penalty in the case and Routh will now serve life without parole for the murders of Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield at a Texas shooting range. Scroll down for video . Relief: Jeff Kyle, the brother of slain sniper Chris Kyle, appeared on Fox & Friends on Thursday and said he was relieved that Eddie Ray Routh was found guilty of murder - but that he wishes he was dead . Together: Jeff, pictured with his brother Chris, right, said the nine-day trial was 'grueling' for his family . Attorneys had been placed under a gagging order at the time Erath County District Attorney Alan Nash said he would not seek the death penalty and so did not release detail about their decision. But  Andrea Lyon, a defense attorney and dean of the law school at Valparaiso University, told the Associated Press at the time it was 'presumably because they thought it wouldn't stick'. Speaking on Fox on Thursday, Jeff Kyle, 37, said he was relieved that the jury had rejected Routh's claims that he was mentally ill when he shot dead the men dead. 'Just for the simple fact that this idiot murdered my brother and Chad and now he's going to spend the rest of his life paying for it,' Kyle said. He also spoke of his frustration that Routh had blamed the killings on PTSD and mental illness. Defense witnesses had said Routh showed signs of schizophrenia and psychosis. 'He's not crazy,' Kyle said. 'He was always hopped up on drugs - that's not crazy.' Guilty: Former Marine Eddie Ray Routh, 27, now faces life in prison without parole after a jury in Stephenville, Texas found him guilty of murder on Tuesday. The jury rejected the defense's claims he was mentally ill . Murdered: Chris Kyle, left, was killed alongside his friend Chad Littlefield, right, in February 2013 . Kyle said that the nine-day trial was 'grueling' for the family but that they were infinitely thankful for the support they had received. 'It's huge to know that everybody - not just Texans and not just people in the U.S. - people all over the world [are] in support of it,' he said. Routh was unemotional as he was found guilty of the two murders on Tuesday evening, little more than two hours after the jury started deliberating. Speaking on Wednesday, jurors said they had 'no doubt' that Routh knew right from wrong when he shot the men dead on February 2, 2013 before he fled in Kyle's pick-up truck. 'He knew the consequences of pulling the trigger,' juror Barrett Hutchison said on Good Morning America as he appeared alongside several other jurors. Juror Kristina Yager added that Routh routinely claimed he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder from his time serving overseas in Iraq and Haiti when he got into trouble with the law. Thankful: Kyle's widow Taya, pictured leaving court on Tuesday, wrote on Facebook on Wednesday that she was thankful for the jury's decision as she paid tribute to Chris as 'the love of my life' 'Every time something bad happened, he pulled that card,' Yager said. His family and friends had testified how Routh returned from abroad a changed man who was reliant on marijuana and alcohol, and who often had bouts of paranoia that sent him to VA hospitals. But the prosecution argued that he was under the influence of drugs at the time of the killing and an expert witness testified Routh was faking his mental illness. On Thursday, Chris Kyle's widow Taya Kyle, who gave emotional testimony at the trial, thanked the jury for its decision as she paid tribute to her husband on Facebook. 'God Bless the Jury And good people of Stephenville, Texas!!' she wrote. 'Chris, you are the love of my life. You live on in my heart. You always will. I hope we all live lives that make you proud. And babe, Rest assured you don't need a fancy resting place – you live on… Safe In the hearts you left behind.'

"The Clinton Foundation now says it took $500,000 in 2010 from Algeria without notifying the State Department as was required.  Hillary Clinton, left, was serving in President Barack Obama's cabinet at the time while her husband, Bill, right, ran the family charity . A family charity founded by former President Bill Clinton, under scrutiny for accepting millions of dollars in contributions from foreign countries while Hillary Clinton was at the State Department, has admitted to violating an ethics agreement with the United States government. The Clinton Foundation said it would stop cashing checks from foreign governments it had not previously done business with in 2009 when Hillary became President Barack Obama's secretary of state to avoid any conflicts of interest. But it now says it took $500,000 in 2010 from Algeria without notifying the State Department as was required. Algeria, according to Amnesty International, has a 20-year history of stifling 'basic' human rights and arresting and indefinitely detaining dissidents. In her memoir Hard Choices, released last year, Clinton acknowledges that he country has a 'poor human rights record and a relatively closed economy.' The stated purpose of the money was for disaster relief in Haiti. However, at the time of its donation to the Clinton Foundation, Algeria spent almost as much lobbying the State Department as it sought to build a better relationship with the U.S. government in spite of its human rights record,the Washington Post reports. The country has not given to the Clinton Foundation since. During Clinton's time at State her husband's non-profit, which she has since joined, as well, also took money from the governments of Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Australia, Norway and the Dominican Republic, according to the Post. Kuwait is listed by Amnesty International as a country where violence against woman runs rampant. Qatar, it says, has mostly cleaned up its acts but 'allegations of torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment continue to be reported.' It spent $5.3 million lobbying the Obama administration during Clinton's tenure. Oman has undergone a 'very gradual opening of the political process' in the last several years, Amnesty says. While Clinton was in Obama's cabinet the country's security forces killed at least two protesters during a confrontation and later arrested and cloistered 'dozens' of other government critics, the organization alleges. A spokesperson for 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. played down the implications of the countries' giving to the Clinton charity, telling the Post the agreement was crafted 'to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest. Realistically, the spokeswoman, Jennifer Friedman, said, the contract with Clinton went 'above and beyond standard ethics requirements.' The concerns about the Clinton Foundation's foreign donors is not new. At Clinton's confirmation hearing, then-Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar, a Republican, warned that the situation could cause 'potential perception problems' for the U.S. government. 'The Clinton Foundation exists as a temptation for any foreign entity or government that believes it could curry favor through a donation,' he said. And then-Massachusetts' Sen. John Kerry, now the Secretary of State, said his colleague's questions were 'legitimate.' 'If you are traveling to some country and you meet with the foreign leadership and a week later or two weeks later or three weeks later the president travels there and solicits a donation and they pledge to give at some point in the future but nobody knows, is there an appearance of a conflict?' Kerry asked his predecessor. The Clinton Foundation's fundraising practices have been called back into question as Hillary actively prepares to enter the next race for the White House. The charity lifted a self-imposed ban on foreign donations and launched a $250 million endowment drive, receiving money from the likes of Saudi Arabia, once Hillary left her post at the State Department in 2013. According to the Wall Street Journal the foundation has also received money from the United Arab Emirates and a Canadian government agency promoting the Keystone XL pipeline. The non-profit says it dropped the embargo  to provide 'long-term stability.' 'As with other global charities, we rely on the support of individuals, organizations, corporations and governments who have the shared goal of addressing critical global challenges in a meaningful way,' foundation spokesman Craig Minassian told the Post. 'When anyone contributes to the Clinton Foundation, it goes towards foundation programs that help save lives.' The charity stopped accepting foreign donations at the request of Obama officials while Hillary was secretary of state, but started again with a $250million endowment drive after she left the post in 2013 . In defending itself, the organization, which is run by Bill and Hillary along with daughter Chelsea, said, said it would review its practices if Mrs. Clinton makes a bid for the White House. 'Should Secretary Clinton decide to run for office, we will continue to ensure the foundation's policies and practices regarding support from international partners are appropriate, just as we did when she served as secretary of state,' a spokesperson said. The Post found the foundation had raised nearly $2 billion since  it launched in 2001. About one-third of the foundation's donations of $1 million or more came from foreign governments or entities based outside the United States, the Post analysis found. The charity has since agreed to disclose its donors online and noted in the statement that it has a 'record of transparency that goes above what is required of U.S. charities.' Additionally, it says its Clinton Global Initiative has improved the lives of 430 million people in 180 countries since 2005. A spokesman for the Republican National Committee, Michael Short, said the 'alarming rate at which these contributions are now coming in presents a massive conflict of interest problem.' The committee's chairman, Reince Priebus, called on the Clinton Foundation to 'immediately' reinstate the ban and return millions of dollars to the foreign governments that have already donated. 'She's setting an incredibly dangerous precedent,' Priebus said. 'The American people are not about to elect a president in Hillary Clinton who could expose them to the demands of foreign governments because they dumped massive sums of cash into her foundation.' Longtime Clinton ally Terry McAullife,  the chair of Hillary 2008 presidential campaign and a former head of the Democratic National Committee who is now the governor of Virginia, mocked Clinton's attackers. 'If your criticism ... is that she raised too much money for her charity to help people around the globe, OK, I'll take that,' McAuliffe, a former board member of the foundation, told the Associated Press. In addition to foreign governments, Clinton's foundation regularly works with Fortune 500 companies and financial firms - some of which have separately paid her upwards of $200,000 to speak at their own conferences. Among them are Goldman Sachs, HSBC Bank USA, Barclays and Deutsche Bank, Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Monsanto, Procter & Gamble and ExxonMobil.","It took $500,000 in 2010 from Algeria without notifying the State Department .

"The possession of small amounts of marijuana has become legal in Washington DC, escalating the row between the city's mayor and Congress. The new law came into force at midnight and allows anyone over the age of 21 to possess 2oz of cannabis and grow up to six plants in their home. This is despite warnings from Republicans in congress that the city's mayor Muriel Bowser had exceeded her powers by legalizing the drug. Scroll down for video . In November residents of Washington DC voted to allow the possession of a small amount of marijuana . This is because the District of Columbia is not a state and is required to seek the OK from Congress for the majority of its legislation. Congress tried to block the initiative by preventing funds from last year's national budget being used to enact the legalization. But city hall officials claimed the move came too late to be valid as the referendum, backed by 65 per cent of voters, had already taken place. 'If you decide to move forward ... you will be doing so in knowing and willful violation of the law,' said Republican representative Jason Chaffetz warned in a letter to Ms Bowser. Chaffetz chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which oversees legislative matters in Washington - the only Western capital whose residents are constitutionally denied a voting representative in their national legislature. 'You can go to prison for this,' Chaffetz reportedly told the Washington Post. 'We're not playing a little game here.' Washington Mayor Muriel  Bowser speaks during a press conference on Capitol Hill  in Washington, DC . Rep. Jason Chaffetz listens during a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill,  in Washington, DC . But Ms Bowser said: 'Residents spoke loud and clear when they voted to legalize small amounts of marijuana in the District of Columbia. Earlier this week she added: 'We believe that we are acting lawfully. I have a lot to do here in the District of Columbia, so me being in jail won't be a good thing.' Only three times in four decades has Congress overturned a municipal law in Washington. President Barack Obama's administration has stated that Washington ought to be able to run itself, regardless of its federal district status. Washington DC is a a federal district and not a state. As a result the constitution grants congress  the final say over the District of Columbia. It can overturn local laws and exercises greater oversight of the city than exists for any state. Only three times has Congress overturned a municipal law in Washington. President Barack Obama's administration has stated that Washington ought to be able to run itself, regardless of its federal district status. The District also is in the unique position that it does not have a voting representative in congress. 'We do not believe that Congress should spend a lot of time interfering with the ability of the citizens of the District of Columbia to make decisions related to how they should govern their community.' White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in December. The District of Columbia follows Colorado, Washington and Alaska who already allow recreational pot use, with Oregon set to follow in July. Under the new law adults over 21 can possess no more than two ounces of cannabis and grow up to six cannabis plants at home. The drug can only be smoked or taken in private. The sale of pipes, bongs and rolling papers will also be permitted, but the buying and selling of marijuana remains illegal. Those caught smoking the drug in public will face up to 60 days in jail or $500 dollar fine. Despite the new law it will not apply to 29 per cent of the city that is under federal control. This means that anyone can still be arrested for possession if they are on they are federal land, which includes the White House, Capitol Hill, military bases, and in national parks. A total of 51 percent of Americans are said to be in favor of legalization, according to a Gallup poll in October. 'If the president can brew and drink beer in the White House, adults should be allowed to grow and consume a less harmful substance in their houses,' said Robert Capecchi of the Marijuana Policy Project. 'Alcohol is no longer the only authorized social lubricant in town. A safer alternative is legal for adults.' However, opponents worry that the government won't truly be able to regulate the marijuana industry to make sure sellers are distributing safe to use product. They're also concerned that it will lead to greater numbers of car accidents as high drivers take to the roads.

"A multi-millionaire businessman responsible for storing some of the greatest art treasures and luxury goods in the world has been arrested on suspicion of fraud. Yves Bouvier - whose rich and famous clients include many from Britain - was placed in custody in Monaco on Wednesday night, along with two alleged accomplices. It follows a complaint about his so-called 'Freeports' - vast repositories where ultra-high net worth individuals keep their treasures. Yves Bouvier was detained in Monaco, along with two alleged accomplices, in a fraud case centred around his ownership of Luxembourg Freeport, allegedly used to manipulate prices in the art market . They include everything from priceless paintings to top marque cars, fine wines and cigars, with Mr Bouvier insisting all would be kept safe and under conditions of utter secrecy. This had led to accusations that they are being used to avoid tax, and even to fence off stolen property before it is sold. A source close to Monaco prosecutors today confirmed that the current investigation centres on Mr Bouvier's deposit in Luxembourg, and attempts to 'manipulate art prices'. The £50m Luxembourg Freeport is situated in the cargo centre of the Grand Duchy's Findel airport, and occupies a bomb-proof 11,000 square metre building. It contains state-of the-art facilities for storing cars, wine, cigars, art works, and other luxury items, including precious metals. Mr Bouvier, who also owns the Singapore Freeport, insisted that his so-called 'bonded-area' was completely above board, even though similar complexes have been linked with smuggling and other illicit activity. The £50m Luxembourg Freeport building, a vast repository were the mega-rich can store high value items . The Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev, owner of Monaco football club, is thought to be one of his victims. Tetiana Bersheda, a lawyer representing Mr Rybolovlev, said in a statement that an 'investigation has been launched by the judicial authorities of Monaco against Mr Yves Bouvier, one of the most famous people in the world of art who is the owner of the free ports of Singapore, Geneva and Luxembourg among others. 'After having worked for more than 10 years with Mr Bouvier, the Rybolovlev family received some information about possible fraud and manipulation of prices on the art market by Mr Bouvier and his accomplices. 'The scope and all the victims of the fraudulent scheme created by Mr Bouvier have not yet been identified at this time.' Mr Rybolovlev is one of the richest men in the world, with an art collection which includes Monets, Picassos and Van Goghs. Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev is one of Bouvier's alleged victims, and his lawyer has released a statement about the investigation into Bouvier . Rybolovlev owns Monaco FC who play in the principality, with its glamorous harbour pictured here . There was no immediate comment from representatives of Mr Bouvier about his arrest. David Arendt, managing director of the Luxembourg Freeport, said last year: 'The legislative framework under which the Luxembourg Freeport operates guarantees total traceability of all goods stored and ensures that all activities strictly comply with international standards. He added: 'The Luxembourg Freeport has eight showrooms and a spectacular lobby designed to display the goods in storage.' Shell are among companies who have called for the closure of 'bonded areas' in the Philippines, where oil smuggling costs hundreds of millions of dollars in lost tax revenue every year. In 2003 the authorities in Switzerland, where there are numerous similar centres, announced they would return hundreds of antiques stolen from Egypt and then stored. Richtung22, a pressure group campaigning against tax avoidance, said the Luxembourg site was typical of many being used to avoid tax, and to cover up other illegal activity.","Yves Bouvier was detained in Monaco, along with two alleged accomplices .

"Pensions minister Steve Webb has hinted the Government is going to extend the scheme to current pensioners . Ministers are expected to unveil plans in the Budget next month which would allow millions of pensioners to cash in their annuities. Pensions Minister Steve Webb has given his strongest indication yet that the Government will launch a consultation into the radical proposal imminently. The changes will give five million retirees the same freedoms as those who have not yet taken their pension. Under reforms to be introduced in April, workers will no longer have to buy an annuity – an annual income for life – when they retire, and can instead cash in all or part of their savings. But until now this freedom has not applied to existing pensioners who have already bought an annuity. At a conference for the Association of British Insurers yesterday, Mr Webb hinted the Government was going ahead with plans to extend the scheme to current pensioners. The changes will help people who are locked into low-paying annuities, who would rather cash it in and spend the lump sum. Insurers would buy the annuity from the pensioner and, in return, the firm would be entitled to that person’s monthly income until they died. Experts predict the Government will announce a consultation in the Budget to woo the ‘grey vote’ in the run-up to the General Election. Around five million pensioners hold six million annuities, worth about £11billion a year, according to Government figures. Mr Webb said early talks with pensions providers had been positive, saying: ‘I have not heard any compelling argument against the proposition [to allow annuities to be sold].’ He told the Mail there was ‘growing interest in how this will work’ and that he was working on the details. The proposition, he said, was simple. ‘I have a stream of income. I would rather have capital. Someone then buys it from me – I envisage a financial institution rather than an individual,’ he said. He denied that many people could be ripped off by insurers and pension firms, who may pay offer paltry sums for a valuable lifetime income, explaining: ‘Lots of these annuities were taken out, say, five years ago, when interest rates were way higher, so that stream of income would cost a fortune to buy now – that will make the deal more attractive.’ He added that retirees would need to be aware that transaction fees and consultation fees could soon erode a very small annuity. Pensions expert Tom McPhail, of Hargreaves Lansdown, said it was ‘very likely’ that the Government would announce a consultation about the sale of annuities, an idea which ‘sounds attractive in principle’. But he warned: ‘There is, however, a significant risk of consumer detriment and mis-selling and the costs of any system like this may well outweigh any possible benefits.’","Ministers expected to unveil plans allowing pensioners to cash in  annuities .

"Piloting a 256-foot long vessel must be difficult, but the crew maneuvering Steve Jobs' super-yacht through through a narrow draw-bridge in the Caribbean make it look easy on the aerial footage of the feat. Drone videographer Brian Muston recorded the $120million vessel passing through the 56-foot opening in the Simpson Bay bridge en route to open waters in Sint Maarten. Jobs commissioned Venus in 2008 after spending several summers on the yacht owned by  Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle and a friend of Jobs. Scroll down for video . Approach: The 39-foot wide Venus was seen leaving the Simpson Bay Lagoon, with a 56-foot wide bridge opening leaving about 8 feet on either side for an exit . Drone footage: Videographer Brian Muston taped Venus using a drone and uploaded the footage to YouTube . But work on Venus wasn't completed until 2012, a year after Jobs passed away following a struggle with pancreatic cancer. Phillippe Starck helped design the sleek 256-foot long vessel, and Jobs enlisted the chief engineer of the Apple Stores to design reinforced glass for its walls, according to his biographer Walter Isaacson. Starck spoke about Venus in an interview with French Vanity Fair, explaining the yacht houses six bedrooms along with communication systems between the kids' rooms in the front and the adult quarters in the rear. 'Steve wanted to be sure that the teenagers could be set up in the front of the boat when he was at the back and vice-versa. He was obsessed with silence,' Starck said. 'In his home, children did not make noise, nor the dog, nor his wife … no one made any noise, ever.' Jobs' widow Laurene Powell Jobs currently owns the ship, which has been seen in Montanegro, Palma, Gibraltar and Horta Azores according to Shipspotting.com. The ship was recently underway west of Saba, another Dutch island in the Caribbean, according to Marine Traffic. There may be a legal scrape in the future for Muston, who was flying the drone less than a kilometer away from the Princess Juliana International Airport SXM in Sint Maarten. The Daily Herald reports that the airport's director was discussing the issue with the Department of Civil Aviation. Tight squeeze: Luxury ships pass through the opening frequently, though not all have the celebrity appeal of Jobs' vessel .

"A bullet used in AR-15 rifles that is popular with hunters and sports shooters is set to be banned, according to new plans from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives this month. The 5.56mm green tip bullets will be re-classified as armor-piercing ammunition, meaning they can break through bulletproof vests, effectively prohibiting them from being sold or manufactured for civilian use. However citizens in possession of the bullets will not face criminal prosecution because they are widely available. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives plans to ban the 5.56mm green tip bullet (pictured) from being sold or manufactured for general public use because of its armor-piercing capabilities . The sale of armor-piercing bullets to the general public was banned under the Law Enforcement Officers Protection Act of 1986, according to the Idaho State Journal. The 5.56mm bullets were originally exempt under the law because they were not used in handguns - which the 1986 act specifically targets. But, according to the ATF, there has been a recent surge in AR-15 style pistols that are capable of firing the bullet. Unlike the standard 5.56mm-caliber ammo, the green tip has a steel penetrator that increases penetration when the bullet hits something. In the proposal, released earlier this month, the ATF stated the green tip bullet, when loaded into specific cartridges, can be used in a handgun. The legislation has not yet been brought into effect. Thirty House of Representatives members have signed a letter created by Virginia Republican Rep. Bob Goodlatte demanding the ATF explain the 'surprise bullet ban,' according to the Washington Examiner. 'Millions upon millions of M855 rounds have been sold and used in the US, yet ATF has not even alleged - much less offered evidence - that even one such round has ever been fired from the handgun at a police officer,' his letter said. An executive director at the NRA said the Obama administration was attempting to ban the AR-15 through ammunition regulation after failing to do so through 'the legislative process' An NRA executive director said the Obama administration was attempting to ban the AR-15 through ammunition regulation after failing to do so through 'the legislative process'. The AR-15 was banned under the Assault Weapons Ban of 1994, which expired in 2004. A number of policymakers have tried to reinstate the ban but have been unsuccessful. President Obama most recently proposed a renewal of the ban following the Sandy Hook massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, but it failed in the Senate by 20 votes in 2013. In December ten families affected by the Sandy Hook shootings sued Bushmaster, the manufacturer of the AR-15 that was used by Adam Lanza to gun down 20 children and six adults.","The 5.56mm green tip bullet is popular with hunters and sports shooters .

Their lawyers  now have 14 days to lodge an appeal, according to one of their lawyers Peter Morrissey. '(Indonesia) have a court system, they have a rule of law and when you have the rule of law it stands to reason that you just don't execute the people who are litigating,' Mr Morrissey said. 'So what we think will happen is that the Indonesian executive will likely cooperate with the rule of law and act in accordance with it and not do anything drastic unless all legal impediments really are removed. And right now there is a live appeal on foot. 'We are very hopeful about it, you know. We are not going to give up. Even if we had no hope we wouldn't give up. But we do have hope because the argument is a sensible good argument.' Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop revealed on Wednesday that Sukumaran's mother hugged her tightly and begged her to save her son from the firing squad. 'My last meeting with Mrs Sukumaran she hugged me so tightly I could hardly breathe,' Ms Bishop told Nine's Today show. 'No person could fail to be touched by the anguish of the families.' Last week Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, who was been leading the diplomatic campaign to save the duo, was forced to clarify that Australian was not threatening to withdraw foreign aid to Indonesia should Chan and Sukumaran be executed . Ms Bishop said both men have been rehabilitated in the most remarkable way and were helping to rehabilitate other prisoners in Bali . 'We continue to appeal to President Joko Widodo's sense of generosity and his sense of forgiveness and hope that he will consider these clemency pleas and that there will be a stay of execution.' Ms Bishop said she wasn't understating the gravity of their drug crimes, but noted it was 10 years ago and they had made efforts to rehabilitate with Chan now a priest and Sukumaran being an accomplished artist. 'Both men have been rehabilitated in the most remarkable way. They are adding value to prison life in that they are working with other prisoners. 'They are rehabilitating other prisoners and helping Indonesia with this whole process of rehabilitating people, such as drug offenders.'","Young Indonesians have staged a defiant protest against Tony Abbott .

"A group of gipsies built a giant cannabis factory on the grounds of their camp which they were given a  £1.3million government grant to upgrade. A well-organised drug operation capable of producing £250,000 of cannabis a year was found when police raided the camp in Merthyr Tyfdil, South Wales yesterday. Cannabis plants were being grown in sheds and outbuildings on half of the pitches on the three-acre site. Raid: The cannabis factory was discovered when police raided the three-acre site in South Wales yesterday . Professional: Officers found an extensive operation capable of producing £250,000 worth of cannabis a year . Factory: Officers arrested 16 people living on the site in connection with the production of cannabis . Officers arrested 16 people living on the site in connection with the production of cannabis and three others in connection with separate offences. They said a 'small minority of individuals' with links to the site had been involved. The Glynmill Gypsy and Traveller Site received a government grant of worth £1.3million in 2011 to refurbish the site and build a community centre for its 120 residents. The money was also used to construct three toilet blocks and to landscape the grounds, according to information from Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council. But officials were tipped off that people living there had been seen buying large amounts of compost and gardening equipment from a local garden centre. More than 100 officers stormed the gipsy camp in a multi-agency raid. Trading Standards, VOSA, DVLA, the Department for Work and Pensions, and the RSPCA were also involved in the operation. Cannabis was found growing in 12 of the 24 caravan plots on the three-acre site during the raid. The street value of the illegal crop is estimated at between £60,000 and £70,000. Upgrade: In 2011, the Glynmill Gypsy and Traveller Site received a government grant of worth £1.3million to refurbish the site and build a community centre, pictured, for its 120 residents . Improvements: The money was also used to build three toilet blocks and to landscape the grounds, according to information from Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council. Above, one of the buildings on site . With an average three-month growth cycle, it means the site was capable of generating more than £250,000 worth of cannabis each year. Chief Inspector Phillip Ashby, of South Wales Police, said: 'We were able to act on some good intelligence and put a large and complex operation together. 'Before today, a small minority of individuals linked to the site had done their best to prevent outside engagement with the site, and it is now clear why. 'This now presents an opportunity to build bridges with people at this location and ensure their welfare. 'Those arrested today can expect to be dealt with robustly - we have specially trained officers who will utilise the Proceeds of Crime Act to ensure any assets suspected to be gained through criminality are seized. 'My message to anyone growing cannabis is that it's only a matter of time before we find you, no matter where you are.'

"She's one of the hottest new stars in Hollywood, who found herself firmly in the 'best dressed' Oscar lists after her appearance in a Saint Laurent dress and bold scarlet lips on the red carpet. Now Margot Robbie, 24, who wowed on Sunday with her new on-trend long, has admitted that trying 'on a whole lot of nice clothes' is one of the best parts of her job. In Focus, the Australian-born beauty wears a dazzling array of designer names including Gucci, Saint Laurent, Michael Kors and Givenchy  and she describes the film as 'like playing dress up'. Scroll down for video . Margot Robbie wears head-to-toe designer clothes and accessories in con caper Focus . Margot shows off a clinging one-shoulder Roland Mouret dress in the con-artist caper with Will Smith (left) Margot says he lets the costume designers get on with their job and rarely offers her own suggestions; in one scene she shows off a Herve Lege halter neck bikini top (right) in the new film with Will Smith . She said: 'The costume choices are always pretty instrumental in creating your character so I was lucky that they were very open to any suggestions. 'Most of the time I just try to stay out of it or you end up dressing yourself and looking like yourself so it's better letting the people hired to do the job, do their job.' Playing Jess, a pickpocket who joins up with seasoned conman Will Smith for a huge heist, the Australian actress had to portray a thief pretending to be a wealthy woman. While many cinema-goers will catch the film to see if the chemistry between Margot and her co-star is as sizzling as rumoured, others will be captivated by her chic on-screen wardrobe, which is worth thousands. In one pool scene, she dons a sexy Herve Leger halter neck black strappy bikini, teamed with Prada platform sandals. A body-con floral-print white dress by Trina Turk is in one scene shot in Argentina, while the over-sized shades are Gucci. Margot plays pickpocket Jess who gets involved with a big-time con artist, and she said for the scenes filmed in Buenos Argentina (right), she wore form-fitting colourful dresses like this Trina Turk floral-print number . Margot also shows off her slim, toned physique in a red one-shoulder jersey dress by Roland Mouret along with Alexander Wang pumps. She said: 'The costume fittings for this were really fun because I got to wear cool clothes. 'The only input I had to my costuming was that I wanted there to be a difference between the first half and the second half of the movie looks for Jess. At the start of the film, Jess's look is 'street, a little more edgy', said Margot, adding that she wears a 'leather jacket, nail polish that's kind of chipped, dark roots in her hair. 'In the second half, she's acquired more funds and wearing designer clothes. A little more form-fitted, geometric, sort of architecturally cool stylised looks.' Along with a couple of Dolce & Gabbana items, she singled out 'some very fancy shoes' as memorable on-screen style moments. Even in one early scene, when she's a scrappy thief, she's still dressed in expensive threads including a Helmut Lange white goat fur coat, Jimmy Choo ankle boots and a Givenchy knee-length skirt. The actress showed off a cool new hairdo and a stunning  Van Cleef & Arpels necklace, a plunge-front Saint Laurent, Seventies-style black gown and the final touch - stunning statement red lipstick . Margot's Saint Laurent custom made gown . Shop Saint Laurent at Saks Fifth Avenue! Visit site . Recently hailed as the new Marilyn Monroe, ever-rising Hollywood star Margot Robbie felt it was safe to take the plunge and challenge the flattering comparison by wearing an anti-Monroe style gown at the 2105 Oscars. The blonde bombshell, most notable for her voluptuous curves and her role in The Wolf of Wall Street, kept most of her enviable frame under wraps in a flowing black gown by Saint Laurent featuring sheer black sleeves and a draped plunging neckline. Sultry in a subtle way, Margot went by the ‘less is more’ mantra and stayed classy for the annual event, although we would have quite liked to have seen her pour her curves into a scarlet corseted gown of some sort and ooze old Hollywood glamour. Her alluring demeanour remains intact nevertheless! Margot hit the style spot anyhow (be it a safe bet)  and we love this gown because we can take some inspiration from it due to its timeless and wearable aesthetic.

But the toddler appears unfazed by the mysterious bump and continues to gurgle happily on the floor. Father-of-three Mr Hood said: 'Lexi is very sturdy on her feet and is a very confident walker and a happy funny baby. We were watching TV and there was no way she could go back like that. 'We were filming her as a bit of a memento because she was doing peek-a-boo and she thought we couldn't see her when she covered her eyes. 'She just went shooting back. Her arms went out to the side and she went back, as if she has been pushed or pulled. 'Then she said ""naughty boy"" like she usually says when she is telling off the cat if it nips her or something. 'When we looked at the film it really freaked us out - it doesn't look at all like she is just falling.' Father-of-three Mr Hunt said the family had been spooked by Lexi's fall. He said: 'When you hear creaks as the house is settling down we are thinking about it more and I keep looking at everything twice.

"Fox News' Bill O'Reilly is facing new claims that he lied about reporting following JFK's assassination . Book publishers for Fox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly say they stand behind his work despite questions that have been raised about his reporting. O'Reilly's series of books about the deaths of John F. Kennedy, Abraham Lincoln and Jesus Christ have sold millions of copies and been turned into successful movies for the National Geographic channel. The latest adaptation, Killing Jesus, is set to premiere on Palm Sunday. The liberal watchdog Media Matters for America this week reported on a 2013 online post that questioned O'Reilly's claim that in 1977 he was outside the Florida home of George de Mohrenschildt, a friend of Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, when he killed himself with a shotgun. De Mohrenschildt had been contacted by congressional investigators looking into the assassination. O'Reilly's claim that he was there was in his book Killing Kennedy. Henry Holt and Co. 'fully stand behind Bill O'Reilly and his best-seller Killing Kennedy, and we're very proud to count him as one of our most important authors,' spokesperson Pat Eisemann said. Fox News issued a statement reiterating its 'staunch support' for O'Reilly and said it would not respond to the individual accusations. Also this week, the publisher of O'Reilly's best-selling 'The O'Reilly Factor' defended the book, which refers to his disputed coverage of the Falklands War. The magazine Mother Jones said that O'Reilly claimed to be in a 'war zone' in Argentina when instead he was at a demonstration far from the front. David Drake, senior vice president and deputy publisher for the Crown Publishing Group, said that Crown would 'continue to publish our author's book just as he wrote it.' Did he lie?: Bill O'Reilly, pictured here at a February Lakers game, was accused of lying in his book Killing Kennedy . O'Reilly has faced questions on his books in the past. In 2011, one of the stores at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C., where Lincoln was assassinated, declined to sell Killing Lincoln because of historical errors. Those included giving the wrong year the theater was destroyed by fire and referring to the Oval Office in the White House when it had not been built. Media Matters posted another story Wednesday questioning an O'Reilly statement that he had witnessed the execution of four nuns during El Salvador's civil war in 1980, based on a 2012 statement that O'Reilly made that 'I saw nuns get shot in the back of the head.' O'Reilly said Wednesday, however, that he had been shown pictures of the aftermath of the shooting while he was in El Salvador. He said his 2012 statement, during a discussion of the nature of evil after the Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting massacre, was a reference to seeing those pictures, not the shooting itself. O'Reilly was defended - sort of - by longtime nemesis Jon Stewart on Comedy Central's 'The Daily Show' on Monday. Stewart has suggested the media should be spending more time looking at the actions of politicians than media figures like Brian Williams and O'Reilly. Stewart noted the reporting on O'Reilly's past work at the same time his Fox show, 'The O'Reilly Factor,' is sending a staffer to look at all the snow in Boston and question global warming - reporting more worthy of scrutiny. 'Why don't we just agree that a certain amount of anecdotes from our media figures are seasoned with (expletive) and let's move on,' Stewart said. Bill O'Reilly lied about being at the home of a witness in the JFK assassination investigation when he committed suicide, according to new claims from veteran colleagues. The Fox News host has reiterated in his own best-selling books and TV interviews that he 'heard' the fatal gunshot at the Florida home of George de Mohrenschildt in 1977 while he was a reporter for Dallas-based WFAA-TV. Several of O'Reilly's esteemed former colleagues told Media Matters that he is lying - and a police report and government investigation also undermined the Fox star's version of events. De Mohrenschildt was a friend of  shooter, Lee Harvey Oswald. He committed suicide shortly after giving testimony about his links to Oswald as part of a government investigation into President Kennedy's assassination. The Fox host claimed in best-seller, Killing Kennedy, (right) that in 1977, he 'heard' the fatal gunshot in the suicide of George de Mohrenschildt (left) who gave testimony at the investigation into the president's death . On the day De Mohrenschildt was contacted by the House Select Committee on Assassinations, he took his own life. For unexplained reasons, O'Reilly wrote in his bestseller, Killing Kennedy, that 'as a reporter knocked on the door of de Mohrenschildt's daughter's home, he heard the shotgun blast that marked the suicide of the Russian ... that reporter's name is Bill O'Reilly'. Jefferson Morley, a former Washington Post reporter and author, first wrote about O'Reilly's alleged lies on his website, JFKFacts.org in 2013. Mr Morley has previously worked at The Washington Post and Salon and is a visiting professor at the University of California, Washington Center. He told Media Matters that O'Reilly's claims about overhearing the gunshot in De Mohrenschildt's suicide just weren't true. His claims were backed up by Tracy Rowlett, a veteran journalist who covered the JFK assassination. Mr Rowlett is a former anchor and managing editor of Dallas-Fort Worth station, KTVT. He told Media Matters: 'Bill O'Reilly's a phony, there's no other way to put it. 'He was not up on the porch when he heard the gunshots, he was in Dallas. He wasn't traveling at that time.' Another veteran journalist, Byron Harris, who has worked at Texas' WFAA for the past 40 years and  won two Peabody Awards for his investigative work, also told Media Matters that O'Reilly made up the story. A 1977 Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office report into the suicide, which included many witness statements, did not include a statement from O'Reilly. A Fox News spokesperson told Daily Mail Online on Wednesday afternoon: 'Bill O’Reilly has already addressed several claims leveled against him. This is nothing more than an orchestrated campaign by far left advocates Mother Jones and Media Matters. 'Responding to the unproven accusation du jour has become an exercise in futility. FOX News maintains its staunch support of O’Reilly, who is no stranger to calculated onslaughts.' The latest allegations levied at O'Reilly, 65, came after his reporting during the Falklands War was called into question last week. O'Reilly had claimed that he reported in a 'war zone' or 'combat zone' during the conflict between Britain and Argentina in 1982. CBS News on Monday released video from four stories it aired about the Falklands War in 1982, all part of a dispute involving O'Reilly and his subsequent statements about covering the war. None of the stories mention O'Reilly, then a young CBS reporter, or makes any specific reference to a CBS crew member being hurt. The television time travel was prompted by a Mother Jones article last week calling into question O'Reilly claims that he reported in a 'war zone' or 'combat zone' during the brief conflict between Britain and Argentina. Few reporters made it to the front of the war, some 1,000 miles from the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires. O'Reilly has said that he covered an anti-government demonstration in Buenos Aires that turned violent and that a photographer he was working with was knocked to the ground and was bleeding. Describing the events two years ago, O'Reilly said he 'dragged off' the photographer from danger. Former CBS News correspondent Eric Engberg, who was also covering the event, characterized O'Reilly's account as 'dishonest' and 'completely nutty' during a Huffington Post interview on Monday. CBS News on Monday released video from four stories it aired about the Falklands War in 1982. None of the stories mention O'Reilly, then a young CBS reporter, or makes any specific reference to a CBS crew member being hurt . Engberg said none of the camera operators working the night in question remember any of their colleagues being injured. The camera person who was said to be hurt has not spoken publicly about the matter. During one of the CBS reports, then-anchor Dan Rather said that several television crew members were knocked to the ground and that North American television crews were 'jostled'. An Engberg report, also released by CBS Monday, said police fired guns with tear gas and plastic bullets. He said in the report it was not known how many people were hurt, but at least some were seriously injured. An Associated Press account of the demonstration said that police officers charged a group of about 50 journalists, beating some and trampling others. 'Two news photographers were reported injured by rubber bullets fired by police,' said the June 16, 1982, account by AP writer Douglas Grant Mine. O'Reilly, on his program Monday night, showed portions of the CBS video and said it proved the event was no 'walk in the park'. He interviewed Don Browne, a former NBC News Miami bureau chief who was in the Falklands, who also described the situation. No mention was made in O'Reilly's report on Monday about any CBS News personnel being hurt. The Mother Jones piece was printed shortly after NBC News anchor Brian Williams was suspended for misrepresenting his experiences in the Iraq War. O'Reilly, long the most popular prime-time figure in cable news, has called the piece a political hit job. Fox News CEO Roger Ailes has said he fully supports O'Reilly. 'I want to stop this now,' O'Reilly said. 'I hope we can stop it, I really do.'","Publishing company Henry Holt and Company 'fully stand behind Bill O'Reilly and his best-seller Killing Kennedy .

"A mother has spoken of her horror after discovering her fiancé had sex with the teenage lodger she had taken under her wing - in a graveyard. Adele McCormack, from Bradford, broke down in tears  after a lie detector test revealed that her partner, David Dutton, had cheated on her twice with 18-year-old Charlie James who had been living with them. The 41-year-old was told that David had a tryst with the teenager in a  forest near their home and another time at the city's Undercliffe Cemetery close to where his own father was buried. Adele McCormack and David Dutton enjoy a drink after meeting through mutual friends . Charlie James appeared on the Jeremy Kyle Show to confess with a tryst with David after his wife took her in . Adele said she had been enjoying a 'perfect' relationship with David Dutton, who she had met five years ago through mutual friends, and they had quickly fallen in love. She said at first she had been put off by the 13-year age gap between herself and David, now 28, but she had quickly fallen for her toyboy's charms and her life felt complete when, two-and-a-half years later, he proposed at an all-you-can-eat buffet at a Chinese restaurant. She said: 'It was so romantic. Everyone there started applauding when I accepted, and when I got home I began preparing for our big day right away. 'I thought we had a great relationship. We were at it like rabbits in the sack.' However, their fairytale romance was shaken to the core after Charlie was welcomed into the family's Bradford home. 'One night in the pub I bumped into a local girl called Charlie.'I knew her vaguely through a friend of David’s and I noticed she seemed upset,' said Adele. Adele McCormack listens  as details of David Dutton's lie detector tests are revealed on the Jeremy Kyle Show . 'We got chatting and she told me things had been strained at home, so I insisted that she lived at mine.' Initially, David was uncomfortable with the new lodger, calling his fiancé’s generosity, “typical.” 'I set up the spare room and cooked her hearty meals, bought her clothes. I even got her a job at a local call centre,' said Adele, whose 19-year-old daughter, Opal, was 'thrilled' to have another teenager in the house. 'It was Opal who first noticed how Charlie acted around David, all flirty and girly,' added Adele. 'She’d always follow him around and cuddle up to him on the sofa. One day she even offered to go to the shops with him and I grew suspicious.' Adele was so suspicious that she logged onto her fiancé’s Facebook account to see if the pair had been swapping secret messages - and they had. A distraught Adele McCormack breaks down in tears as details of the affair come out on live television . Adele McCormack said she was delighted when David Dutton proposed to her at a Chinese restaurant . 'I clicked on a message from Charlie and felt like I’d been kicked in the stomach,' she said. “Charlie had written, ""I like you, do you like me?"" and David had replied ""Yes, I do!"" it was sickening.' Distraught, Adele threw both her fiancé and her lodger of just a month out of her house. She said David returned the next day, but Charlie never stayed at the house again. 'David was adamant he’d got nothing to hide, but friends told me Charlie was going around telling all and sundry that she’d been sleeping with my fiancé. 'There were even rumours that they’d done the deed in the graveyard near my house.' Determined to clear his name, David offered to go on The Jeremy Kyle Show TV show and take a lie-detector test to prove his innocence. 'I rang the show and booked David in for the test,' she said. 'The producers also contacted Charlie and she also agreed to go on. Adele McCormack said she and David Dutton are working on their relationship . 'But as days went by I started to believe David was telling the truth. He was so sure that he’d done nothing wrong. 'I started to think that maybe Charlie had been stirring up trouble.' However, Adele's gut instinct had been right, and it was while appearing on The Jeremy Kyle Show that she learned David had cheated on her with Charlie after he failed the lie-detector test. The  results revealed that David had intercourse with Charlie on two separate occasions, once in the graveyard and another time in a forest. Adele said: 'Back home David refused to leave. He kept saying, ""I’ll make it up to you no matter what it takes."" 'I thought it was too little, too late,' Adele recalled. 'He had humiliated me in front of millions of people.' However, once back at home, Adele said she started to see things differently and she is now standing by her man having forgiven David. 'I was so angry, but he started doing things around the house, and I slowly started to forgive him. It’s Charlie who is to blame, she's a homewrecker. 'That girl used my kindness as a weakness and pounced on my man in my own home. Adele McCormack has taken partner David back and has labelled a former lodger a 'homewrecker' “I treated her like a daughter. And how did she repay me? By sleeping with David in a graveyard. It’s unforgiveable.' Adele said she and David are still engaged and undergoing relationship counselling. 'Nothing can stop true love, not even Charlie.' David said that he did not think the lie detector test would catch him out, which is why he had volunteered to go on to The Jeremy Kyle Show. 'I love Adele but I hold my hands up, I made a mistake,' he said. 'I'm going to make it work with Adele. I'm doing the washing up and little things to help her out. I need her to trust me again.' Appearing on the TV show, Charlie told host Jeremy Kyle that 'it all happened'. She said: 'Adele had read the Facebook messages he’d been sending me. She confronted him then threw him out, then she confronted me and threw me out. 'I had no idea where I was going. I walked round with David that’s when I ended up sleeping with him. 'He really made me feel like he loved me. The second time he came and met me, we had sex outside again In basically like a forest. 'I know what I did was wrong, and I’ve owned up to it.'","Adele McCormack, 41, saw messages from her lodger to her partner .

"Spring break revelers were being urged to avoid traveling to Mexico this year due to ongoing drug-related violence. The Texas Department of Public Safety said on Tuesday that  cartels operating in the country pose a safety threat because of their 'unpredictable' movements. Last September, 43 Mexican college students went missing and were later confirmed dead after being captured by an organized crime gang in the southwestern city of Iguala. Kidnappings, highway robberies and shoot-outs have also been reported in other resort areas including Acapulco, Guadalajara, Mazatlan, Cancun and Puerto Vallarta. Recipe for disaster: Spring break revelers are being urged to avoid traveling to Mexico due to ongoing drug-related violence (stock photo of Spring Break partying from Cancun) In past years U.S. authorities have raised similar concerns about spring break travel south of the country. Once again extra numbers of state troopers will be patrolling the border areas as the holidays kick off. Stratfor, an intelligence consultancy firm, previously warned that it is not just Mexicans the cartels target. Following a 2013 report on illegal activity in the area, it concluded: 'There is a misconception that cartels want to avoid interfering with the profitable tourism industry, or that they only target Mexican citizen. 'This simply is not true.' Last September, 43 Mexican college students went missing and were later confirmed dead after being captured by an organized crime gang in the southwestern city of Iguala . Travelers are encouraged to use pre-arranged transport, travel in groups and avoid driving at night. They are also advised to hide indicators of wealth such as expensive-looking jewelry, watches, or cameras. The U.S. Department of State notes that casinos or other gambling clubs and adult entertainment establishments are areas of particular safety concern. Many students at the University of Texas-Pan American agreed that Mexico would not be a good choice for spring break. One graduate told Valleycentral.com: 'It’s violent and the kidnappings have gone up in the last few months. 'They are kidnapping a lot of Americans to get ransom money, so it could be dangerous.' The number of U.S. citizens murdered in Mexico was 81 in 2013 and 85 in 2014, according to the Department of State. Meanwhile, kidnappings throughout the region  appear to be on the rise. Between January and November of 2014 more than 130 abductions of U.S. citizens were reported.","The Texas Department of Public Safety said on Tuesday that cartels operating in the country are 'unpredictable'

"After the 35th annual BRIT Awards came to a chaotic end on Wednesday night there was one thing that had everyone talking. It wasn't a showstopping dress on the red carpet or a drunken slurred speech - it was the moment 56-year-old Madonna took a tumble backwards mid-performance. After failing to undo her Armani cloak, which she has since said was tied too tightly, Madonna fell down a set of stairs landing in a crumpled heap on the floor. Scroll down for video . Madonna took a tumble at the BRIT Awards last night, the 56-year-old's fall was one of the most awkward moments in the award show's history . And although the singer pulled herself back up again and carried on her performance of Living For Love which ironically includes the line, 'Took me to heaven and let me fall down,' it was all anyone could talk about. That, and Kanye West. The 37-year-old rapper was roped in to perform at the awards show last minute after Rihanna reportedly didn't show up for rehearsals on Monday. However, he left a stunned audience opened-mouthed as he blasted out his new single All Day, which is includes the N-word said repeatedly. And despite ITV's attempts to censor him, the word was heard three times on television, with many viewers taking to Twitter in droves to complain. But Kanye and Madonna aren't the only people to have caused controversy at the infamously boozy awards show. Kanye's performance came under fire as he continuously used the N-word forcing ITV to mute his performance . Who can forget the time that Jarvis Cocker stormed the stage as Michael Jackson performed his hit song Earth Song in 1996. The Pulp frontman pranced around in front of the late singer and eventually was chased off by one of his backing dancers. There was also that time when Sharon Osbourne called comedian Vic Reeves a p***** b****** after he appeared to be drunk while  presenting an award in 2008. From Alex Turner's rambling acceptance speech in 2014 to Chumbawamba throwing a jug of water over John Prescott in 1998, Femail looks back over the most awkward, and controversial, BRITs moments ever... Last year Alex Turner gave an incredibly rambling acceptance speech seemingly slagging off the very industry that was honoring him . 2014: Alex Turner's Awards Speech . In 2014 the awkward BRIT Awards moment happened when Arctic Monkey's frontman Alex Turner gave an acceptance speech on behalf of the band for their Best British Group award. A rambling Turner lambasted the British music industry and claimed that rock 'n' roll wouldn't go away. He said: 'It will never die. And there's nothing you can do about it.' The speech was met with mass criticism as he seemed to be berating the very people who had given the band the accolade. The singer then ended his rambling message by dropping his microphone on the floor and walking off, leaving the audience stunned. In the same year Harry Styles caused laughs throughout the event when he left his bandmates hanging around on stage as they collected their Global Success award. The One Direction singer nearly missed his big moment because he was in the toilet. Running on stage in the nick of time he said: 'I'm really sorry I was having a wee, the toilets are ages away.' As James Cordon came up behind Adele, interrupting her acceptance speech she swore at the cameras live on television . 2012: Adele Vs The Suits . If there was one thing that didn't go down well at the BRIT Awards in 2012 it was when James Cordon interrupted Adele as she gave her acceptance speech for Album Of The Year. In a rush to introduce Blur and apparently spurred on by the show's producers James came on stage as Adele was making her thank yous and said, 'I'm so sorry, can I just cut off?' The singer responded by asked the TV presenter to clarify what he was saying and when he conceded that she needed to end her speech, she stuck her middle finger up to the camera live on television. Adele later said that she had been offended by the 'suits,' who had stopped her making her full acceptance speech and that she hoped she hadn't offended her fans. In 2010 Liam Gallagher not only snubbed his own brother when accepting the award for the 'Best Album of 30 Years'  missing Noel out of his acceptance speech . 2010: Liam Gallagher didn't want his award and threw his microphone into the audience . Given his history of feuds, punch ups and all round bad behavior it's little wonder than Liam Gallagher has enjoyed a controversial BRIT moment. In 2010 when he was awarded  a special 'Best Album of 30 Years,' award for (What's the story?) Morning Glory' not only did snub his own brother and bandmate, Noel, in his acceptance speech he went on to ramble for a full ten minutes. Then, when he'd finally finished, Gallagher threw not only his microphone but his actual award into the audience. It was reported that BRIT officials had to bargain with a fan to retrieve the statue and it meant the whole of the rest of the evening was delayed. When the Osbournes presented they were characteristically sweary and Vic Reeves ended up being offended by Sharon . 2008: The Osbournes got sweary and The Artic Monkeys dressed as farmers . When the Osbourne family were asked to present the awards in 2008 they clearly didn't get the 'no swearing on live television' memo. Not only did they fill the whole show with expletives, Sharon got particularly angry about comedian Vic Reeves. When he came on stage to present an the Best Album award Sharon deemed him too drunk to do the job after he stumbled over his words. She said to him: 'You’re p*****. P*** off you b******!' The Arctic Monkey's speech had to be cut from ITV's broadcast after they began to slag off the Brit school . Vic later said that it he had got confused over the autocue and felt offended by what Sharon had said. Keeping the controversy flowing the Arctic Monkey's who won the award  that Vic was presenting came on stage and promptly began to slag off the BRIT school. The band had attended the school from which the awards take their name, but Alex Turner proceeded to reveal that they hadn't had a very good time there. So bad was his speech that the producers of the show were forced to cut it short and not air it on the show. Whilst accepting his award for the Best Song in 2000 Robbie decided to challenge Liam Gallagher to a fight . 2000: Robbie Williams called for a fight and DJ Brandon Block thought he'd won an award . At the 2000 BRIT Awards Robbie Williams decided to use his moment of air time to challenge Oasis front man Liam Gallagher to a fight. There had long been an issue between the two of them after Liam had called Robbie the, 'fat dancer from Take That.' An inebriated-seeming Robbie took to the stage whilst accepting his best British Song award and said to the audience: 'So, anybody like to see me fight Liam? Would you pay to come and see it? 'Liam, a hundred grand of your money and a hundred grand of my money. We'll get in a ring and we'll have a fight and you can all watch it on TV.' Brandon stormed on stage thinking he had won an award and ended up with Ronnie Wood's drink in his face . Unfortunately despite Robbie's bravado and willingness to fight Liam, the event never ended up taking place. Robbie's speech wasn't the only awkward moment of the night. As Ronnie Wood was presenting the 'Best Soundtrack' award DJ Brandon Block's friends joked to him that he had won. Unfortunately Block was so drunk at the time that he believed them stumbling on stage to collect his honour. When he was challenged by Ronnie, who called him a c***, Brandon tried to get into a fight with the Rolling Stones drummer and eventually ended up with his drink in his face. Chumbawumba performed at the BRITs in 1998 and later the lead singer Danbert Nobacon chucked a bucket of ice cold water over John Prescott . 1998: Chumbawumba gave  John Prescott a soaking . Two very odd things happened at the BRIT Awards in 1998. Firstly John Prescott was invited to the awards. Secondly, while he was happily sitting at his table he ended up having a bucket of water thrown over his head by lead singer of the band Chumbawumba, Danbert Nobacon. Danbert showed no regret at his actions and said: 'If John Prescott has the nerve to turn up at events like the BRIT Awards in a vain attempt to make Labour seem cool and trendy, then he deserves all we can throw at him.' John Prescott looked pretty unimpressed after having a bucket of ice cold water thrown over him when he attended the BRIT Awards in 1998 . It was during this Michael Jackson performance at the BRIT Awards in 1996 that Jarvis Cocker jumped on stage and mooned the audience . 1996: Jarvis Cocker mooned Michael Jackson . Perhaps one of the most infamous moments in BRITs history was when Jarvis Cocker stormed the stage during Michael Jackson's performance of Earth Song in 1996. Jarvis, the Pulp singer, took to the stage and ran around bending over and showing his bottom to the world as the late singer performed. Jarvis was pictured after the event swigging Champagne from the bottle - he later revealed he wasn't happy with the fact that Michael had been trying to play god . Jarvis later said that he acted the way he did because he couldn't handle the fact that Michael was pretending to be Jesus. He said: 'He was pretending to be Jesus - I'm not religious but I think, as a performer myself, the idea of someone pretending to have the power of healing is just not right. 'Rock stars have big enough egos without pretending to be Jesus - that was what got my goat, that one particular thing.' When Sam Fox and Mick Fleetwood presented the awards in 1989 it was a total disaster, the pair kept on messing up the autocue and fluffing their lines . 1989: The Sam Fox and Mick Fleetwood co-presenting disaster . In 1989 the show's producers made an attempt to revamp the BRITs bringing in the odd combination of the Page 3 model Sam Fox and Mick Fleetwood of Fleetwood Mac to present. The twosome had a disastrous show. Guests came on at the wrong time, they fluffed their lines and they had a pre-recorded Michael Jackson speech which they forgot to air altogether.","Madonna, 56, took a tumble during her  BRITs number on Wednesday night .

"Libyan terrorists have posted pictures of themselves online posing with some of the aeroplanes taken from Tripoli airport after fighters seized it last month. Soldiers from the group Libyan Dawn can be seen climbing on to the wings of commercial jets while smiling and waving for the camera. U.S. officials fear that these aeroplanes could now be used to carry out 9/11-style attacks in the region on the anniversary of the tragedy this month. A total of 11 commercial jets from state-owned carriers Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways went missing in August after militants from the so-called 'masked men brigade' overran the airport. Scroll down for video . Islamists from the rebel group Libyan Dawn have posed with aeroplanes seized from Tripoli Airport last month . Authorities say 11 aircraft taken from Tripoli airport could now be used in terror attacks in the region . In pictures posted online Jihadi soldiers can be seen clambering over aircraft at Tripoli airport. At least 11 planes went missing after the airport fell at the end of last month . Tripoli airport was left as little more than a smouldering ruin after rebels seized control of it in August . Officials have been warning for some time . about the deteriorating situation in Libya, which was controlled by . dictator Muammar Gaddaffi until he was killed in October 2011. 'There are a number of commercial . airliners in Libya that are missing,' one official told the Washington . Free-Beacon. 'We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked . planes.' September 11 not only marks the anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center but it will also be the second anniversary of the  raid of the U.S. Ambassador's compound in Benghazi, Libya. Four Americans were killed in the attack, including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens. Ansar al-Shariah, the group Washington holds responsible for the attack, have also seized parts of the Libyan capital and are known to work with terrorists from ISIS. However they are not thought to be working with fighters from Libyan Dawn, as they are an Al-Qaeda affiliated group. The inside of the main building at Tripoli airport gutted by fire following an attack by Islamist militants . Images posted on Twitter show a fire raging inside one of the terminal buildings as militants attacked . Militias which once fought to oust Muammar Gaddaffi from power in 2011 are now warring between themselves for control of the volatile country . Libyan Dawn, an Al-Qaeda affiliated group, are now in control of part of Tripoli, as are Ansar al-Shariah, the group held responsible for the 2012 attack on the US embassy in Libya . Tripoli International Airport was being run by two anti-Islamist militias and had been closed since mid-July when it was taken over at the end of August by the group Libyan Dawn. Pictures show the aftermath of the firefight, with planes completely or partially blasted and several littered with bullet holes. Tripoli is witnessing one of its worst spasms of violence since Gaddaffi left power. The militias, many of which originate from rebel forces that fought Gaddaffi, became powerful players in post-war Libya, filling a void left by weak police and a shattered army. Successive governments have put militias on their payroll in return for maintaining order, but rivalries over control and resources have led to fierce fighting among them and posed a constant challenge to the central government and a hoped-for transition to democracy. On Sunday,  the Libyan government announced that they had lost control of the capital. Ansar al-Sharia has ties to the Islamic State (also known as ISIS), the Syrian group which today released the filmed beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff - the second recorded execution of a U.S. hostage by the group.

'The second tactic could be to use the airframe with its civilian markings as a tool of deception to insert a full payload of armed terrorists into a locale that otherwise is always open to commercial carriers,' he added. U.S. officials have not publicly confirmed the eleven planes' disappearance, but are reportedly working to track them down. Since the overthrow of previous dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Libya has descended into turmoil and officials fear it may become another safe haven for terrorists, like Syria. Egypt's military government is currently looking into intervening in the country to restore order. The U.S. is taking a more conservative role in the country, but Secretary of State John Kerry said last week that he would be delivering Apache attack helicopters to Egypt.","Eleven planes missing from Tripoli Airport after it was taken by Islamic rebels .

"Two of London's top hotels are among a raft of well-to-do establishments which have been warned to improve their food hygiene by a government watchdog. The Food Standards Agency has given the four-star Radisson Blu Edwardian in Covent Garden and the Royal Lancaster hotel near Hyde Park just two stars in its food hygiene ratings. More than 550 hotels in the UK received two stars or less from the Food Standards Agency, in a study conducted by Which? A spokesperson for The Caledonian Waldorf Astoria in Edinburgh said they have made significant investment to address the low FSA rating it received in its inspection, and that they are looking forward to their next one to improve their rating . At the inspection, the officer will check: . * how hygienically the food is handled – how it is prepared, cooked, re-heated, cooled and stored . * the condition of the structure of the buildings – the cleanliness, layout, lighting, ventilation and other facilities . * how the business manages what it does to make sure food is safe and so that the officer can be confident standards will be maintained in the future . The hygiene standards found at the time of inspection are then rated on a scale. At the bottom of the scale is '0' – this means urgent improvement is required. At the top of the scale is '5' – this means the hygiene standards are very good. Source: food.gov.uk . A two-star rating means the FSA demands 'improvement necessary', while a rating of one requires 'major improvement'. A spokesperson for the FSA said: 'You can't tell a restaurant's hygiene standards by its staff, décor, or by how good the menu looks. It's the things you can't see that you need to consider. 'The food hygiene rating gives you a glimpse into the kitchen and this is why we always ask people to check the hygiene rating before eating out either online or by looking for the green and black sticker and if you can't see one just ask.' At the four-star Royal Lancaster hotel near Hyde Park rooms cost from £223 a night, while the Radisson Blu Edwardian charges £305 a night. Other hotels in and around London that were given a rating of just one or two stars by the FSA included Euston's Thistle Hotel, the Premier Inn in Edgware and Dartford, a Travelodge in Borehamwood and The Britannia in Hampstead. Kate Middleton attended the Boodles Boxing Ball, in aid of Starlight Children's Foundation, at the Royal Lancaster Hotel, in 2008 . Britannia, Birmingham,  £100 per room - 1 star .

Lancaster Hotel, London, £161 per night - 2 stars . Source:  Which? Travel magazine . When you pay £290 a night for a five-star experience, at the Caledonian Waldorf Astoria in Edinburgh, you might expect a luxurious experience. However, the hotel received the lowest food-hygiene ratings, in its last inspection, with the nearby The Scotsman failing to impress as well, despite charging £175 a night. A Caledonian spokesperson said: 'Our new culinary team has implemented stringent measures to ensure this situation does not recur. We welcome the Environmental Health Officer's reinspection at their earliest convenience.' Currently it is compulsory in Wales, and soon in Northern Ireland, that all establishments serving food must display their food-hygiene ratings. Which? Travel is now calling for this to be implemented across England and Scotland. The FSA estimates that there are 500,000 cases of food poisoning every year, and campaigns to make food hygiene a priority for public health. It is currently leading a campaign to bring together the whole food chain to tackle campylobacter, one of the most common causes of food poisoning in the UK, with more than 72,000 confirmed cases last year, most of whom survived, but not all. Other culprits include Clostridium perfringens, Norovirus and Salmonella, which hospitalises around 2,500 per year. Which? Travel editor Jill Starley-Grainger told the Evening Standard: 'It's shocking that any hotel would put their guests' health at risk so we want the display of food hygiene ratings made compulsory as soon as possible.' Out of surveyed individuals in December 2014, a quarter were not aware of food-hygiene ratings, and a further quarter never check them. The hotels named in the report said that processes had been changed since the inspections. A Hilton Worldwide spokesperson said: 'All Hilton Worldwide hotels in the United Kingdom are required to comply with UK and European Union food safety laws. In this particular instance, each hotel acted immediately to address the Environmental Health Officers' concerns.

"The outer shell of a building on Manhattan's West Side that was under demolition has partially collapsed Wednesday afternoon, injuring a construction worker and raining debris on a school bus below. Fire department spokesman Brian Norton says the worker rode down the collapse by standing on scaffolding or part of the three-story midtown Manhattan building as it crumbled. 'He actually was on the third floor, and when the floors pancaked down and collapsed, he rode the three stories down and walked out of the building. He was very lucky,' Fire Chief Dan Donoghue told reporters at the scene. Scroll down for video . Dramatic scene: Firefighters try to shore up the outer shell of a midtown Manhattan building that was in the process of being demolished when it partially collapsed, injuring one worker Wednesday . Dangerous job: Construction crews were using heavy equipment to bring down the three-story brick building at 57th Street near 11th Avenue when the materials between the second and third floors collapsed . Out of commission: The building, which was reportedly built in 1920, has been closed since September 30 . Raining debris: Rubble from the building damaged a yellow school bus parked on the street . Norton says the worker has been hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. He says all other workers are accounted for. Rude awaking: School bus driver Daniel Campbell was awaiting the return of elementary school students from Ridgewood, New Jersey, when falling debris fell on the roof of the bus . About 16 construction workers were using heavy equipment to bring down the three-story brick building at 57th Street near 11th Avenue when the materials between the second and third floors collapsed just before 2.40pm, City Councilwoman Helen Rosenthal told reporters at the scene. Workers say the collapse sounded like an explosion. Scaffolding around the construction site also collapsed and the refuse cascaded onto the roof of a parked school bus, smashing its windshield. That jolted awake driver Daniel Campbell, who was napping inside the otherwise empty bus while awaiting the return of elementary school students  from Ridgewood, New Jersey, who were having lunch at Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square, reported the New York Daily News. 'It was like a nightmare,' Campbell said. 'It was a whole bunch of things that fell.' Demolition permits were properly obtained by the construction company, Councilwoman Rosenthal said. Inspectors from the city's Department of Buildings were checking the safety of the site so that firefighters may conduct searches for anyone who may have been trapped. Lucky to be alive: The injured construction worker rode down the collapse by standing on scaffolding or part of the three-story . The school bus was parked outside the three-story building while a group of elementary students were having lunch at Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square . The startled driver of the school bus likened the building collapse to a nightmare . A half dozen firefighters were being lifted by cherry-picker trucks and were using power tools to saw through the collapsed scaffolding. The building, which was reportedly built in 1920, has been closed since September 30, 2014. The collapse happened a day after a construction worker at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn was crushed to death when several steel beams fell on him.","Workers were using heavy equipment to demolish three-story brick building at 57th Street near 11th Avenue when the facade collapsed .

"Arrested: Thomas Standley, 28 (photographed), was arrested and charged with assaulting his 93-year-old girlfriend, Willie Frances Robinson . A Tennessee man was arrested and charged with assaulting his 93-year-old girlfriend because she refused to take her medication, police say. Twenty-eight-year-old Thomas Standley was arrested Tuesday at the Memphis home he shared with Willie Frances Robinson, 93, after allegedly choking her, squeezing her arms and shaking her violently, NBC news reports. A court affidavit describes the woman as Standley's 'girlfriend/roommate,' but the 93-year-old told WMC Action News 5 that is not entirely true. 'I'm 93 and he's 28. That doesn't go together ,' Robinson said. 'He was staying with me and working full time. He fed me my meals and my medicine. 'It was no love, no sex, no nothing. It was just work.' Officers were called to the home by Robinson's daughter, Patricia Haynes. Haynes, who lives next door to the two, told police that she heard her mother yelling 'Let go of me, you're hurting me,' the affidavit states. When she went to check on her mother, Standley pushed her out of the door, police say. Her mother continued to yell, so Haynes called the police. When the police showed up, Robinson told them that Standley had grown angry with her after she refused to take her medication, according to NBC reports. Home: Standley was arrested at the couples home located on the 3900 block of Brennan Drive (photographed) in Memphis Tuesday after the victim's daughter called the police . She said her arms hurt but refused medical treatment. She told police that this isn't the first time Standley has hurt her. She said Standley hurts her often, though he is supposed to look after her.

"An Iraq war veteran who helped wipe out 50 enemy soldiers in one of the bloodiest battles of the conflict has sold his bravery medal for £156,000. Colour Sergeant James Harkess, 46, cannot work for medical reasons after leaving the army and the sale of his Conspicuous Gallantry Cross - just one down from the Victoria Cross - will help support him financially. The medal sold at London auctioneers Dix Noonan Webb for a hammer price of £130,000 but with all the fees added on the total sum came to £156,000. Colour Sergeant James Harkess has sold his Conspicuous Gallantry Cross for £130,000, after he was awarded it for his bravery in Iraq . The medal, pictured far left on Sgt Harkess' medal set, sold at London auctioneers Dix Noonan Webb for a hammer price of £130,000 but with all the fees added on the total sum came to £156,000 . The sale came on the same day it emerged Afghan veteran Lance Corporal Bruce Toge was to auction his CGC for £70,000. Sgt Harkess was awarded his CGC in 2006 after he and the crew of the Warrior armoured vehicle he was in command of fought off 200 Mahdi Army soldiers during an intense six hour battle. The four-man crew were attacked from all sides with rocket propelled grenades, hand grenades, heavy gun and sniper fire and blast bombs which peppered the vehicle. The men 'took down' wave after wave of enemy soldiers that came at them. The battle in Al Amarah, near Basra, was one of three occasions in two just months where Sgt Harkess displayed 'exceptional bravery' by putting himself in the line of fire to save his men. Sgt Harkess was part of a crew who took down 50 enemy soldiers, who he said were coming at them in waves . Sgt Harkess is seen with Warrior fighting vehicles, having previously helped fight off 200 soldiers from the Mahdi Army . Pictured is the trapped Warrior vehicle Sgt Harkess defended, during which he helped kill 50 enemy soldiers . He first rescued his platoon after securing and holding a route to safety having been cut off by 50 heavily-armed militiamen. Sgt Harkess also went on to bravely lead his Warrior platoon towards the enemy after an insurgent ambush on a night-time supply convoy. With his men pinned down by three snipers he located them, killing two with his rifle and pistol. Sgt Harkess, a former coal miner, spent 22 years in the army and left last year. He later recalled: 'It was constant. There was no let-up, and I was firing all through. My crew took down 50 enemy in total easily. They were coming at us in waves – you could see bodies stacked up where we'd been killing them. 'Guys would jump on rooftops five metres away and start firing. You'd put them down, then more would be there a minute later.' The platoon sergeant, who left the Army last year after 22 years, said: 'I loved the Army. I miss it but when it's your time to leave, you have to go. I have all the memories I require.' The back of Colour Sergeant James Harkess' CGC has his name and rank engraved on it . Presented in 'recognition of an act or acts of conspicuous gallantry during active operations against the enemy', the medal is second only to the Victoria Cross and was created in 1993 and can be awarded to all ranks of the British Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. It was introduced after a review of the honours system as part of a drive to remove distinctions of rank in awards for bravery, replacing both the Distinguished Conduct Medal and the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal, and can also be awarded posthumously. The CGC is silver and in the shape of a cross with a laurel wreath underneath, and is mounted on a white ribbon with blue and crimson stripes. A recipient's rank, name and unit are engraved on the reverse. Corporal Wayne Mills was the first recipient of the CGC, after he saved the lives of his patrol by single-handedly holding off a group of attackers which serving in Bosnia in 1994. Other recipients include Dipprasad Pun, a Nepalese corporal with the Royal Gurkha Rifles who was awarded the honour after he defeated up to 30 Taliban insurgents who were storming his control post in Helmand province in 2010. Three-time Boat Race winner and Army Captain Robin Bourne-Taylor was awarded the medal in 2010, while Royal Marine Mark Jackson ensured his receipt of the award was an extra-special day by proposing to his girlfriend Rebecca Daniel after the 2011 ceremony. To date, 38 CGC's have been awarded for soldiers deployed to Afghanistan and 14 to those serving in Iraq. Sgt Harkess sold his medal set, which is pictured here alongside his belongings which he collected in Iraq . Speaking of his medals, he added: 'I suffer from ill-health which has meant I have not been able to work. Because of this I am dependent on my Army pension so the sale will help me financially.' Physical ill-health means he cannot work, leaving him to rely on his army pension which has prompted his decision to sell his medals at auction. Bravery: Lance Corporal Bruce Toge was awarded the Conspicuous Gallery Cross for saving five wounded comrades during a Taliban attack . L/Cpl Toge is selling his bravery medal for £70,000 next month at Charterhouse Auctioneers of Sherborne, Dorset. L/Cpl Toge showed 'superhuman strength that would have left Rambo in the shade' to rescue five wounded comrades during a battle with the Taliban in 2008. The armoured Warrior vehicle he was with was hit by ten rocket propelled grenades, leaving him unconscious and several troops badly hurt. He came to after 10 seconds and then pulled one severely injured soldier out of the Warrior, lifted him to safety and administered first aid. He found another four wounded soldiers on the ground nearby and single-handedly carried one after the other away from the killing area while being shot at and bombed. L/Cpl Toge sprung back into action to lead the rest of his men to high ground overlooking a village controlled by the enemy who were being led by Taliban warlord Abdul Bari. The men got to within 100 metres of the Taliban before they established contact with at least 20 of them, exchanging grenade and rifle fire before withdrawing to allow British air support to bomb the area. L/Cpl Toge, from Shropshire, is selling his medals as he intends to use the money to start up his own business since leaving the army.

"It may sometimes be referred to as the devil's brew - but it seems this police officer has taken the term a little too literally. Amazing footage has captured the moment a police officer in Brazil performed an astonishing exorcism on a 'drunk' and abusive party-goer before arresting him. Police were called to the scene in Goianira, central Brazil, after the reveller, Rodrigo Betti, 28, began hurling insults at passers-by. When they arrived, Lieutenant Ricardo Mendes, 36, approached Betti and grabbed him by the head while muttering in Latin. Scroll down for video . Exorcism: The police officer puts his hand on the 'drunk' man's forehead and begins to speak in Latin . The religious police officer eventually began to shout: 'Unleash his body, Jesus. Out in the name of Jesus.' Onlooker Paulo Cortez, 25, who captured the extraordinary incident on his camera phone, told local media: 'The drunk began speaking in a weird way, his voice was very low, and he looked very strange. 'The policeman then shouted ""Unleash his body, Jesus. Out in the name of Jesus"". 'I suddenly realised he was doing an exorcism on the man. It was incredible.' As the man sank to his knees growling, Mendes continued holding his head and calling for the devil to get out. Cortez said: 'At one point the man fell to the ground writhing and shouting. It really looked as if he was possessed. But the policeman was doing a great job. Astonishing reaction: Onlookers were stunned as the police officer continued to clutch the man's head while muttering in Latin and calling on the devil to leave the man's body . Ordeal: As the man sank to his knees growling, Lieutenant Ricardo Mendes continued holding his head and calling for the devil to get out . 'Someone behind me then said he was going to get a priest.' A police spokesman who verified the authenticity of the video said: 'When the priest arrived the situation was under control and the man had been fully exorcised. 'The officer acted properly in the situation and did not abuse his authority. He believes in God and regularly goes to church.' Betti was arrested and released the following day.

"Deanna Duggar has recalled a terrifying car crash that nearly killed her and her daughter Amy. The sister of Jim Bob Duggar, the star of TLC show '19 Kids and Counting', was driving home from dinner on New Year's Day in 1993 with  Amy, then six, when their car hit a patch of ice on a bridge on I-40 in Arkansas. The vehicle started spinning and was struck by another car, throwing her from the vehicle and into the road, the 52-year-old told RadarOnline. Suddenly, another car came towards her as she lay helpless in the street. Lucky escape: Amy and Deanna Duggar, pictured last month, have revealed they were involved in a horrific car crash 18 years ago, in which Deanna (right) was thrown from her car and hit by another vehicle . 'I felt the tire go over my leg,' she told Radar. 'I saw the bone come out. I was in sheer shock. I thought, ""I don't want to die today"".' Even though her leg was broken in two places and she suffered a cracked pelvis and collarbone, she managed to crawl across the road to safety. Safe: Amy, pictured as a child, was six at the time of the crash and escaped with just bumps and bruises . A witness called 911 and she was rushed to hospital. Amy had stayed inside the car and only suffered bumps and bruises, and a mystery woman rushed to her side before taking her to the hospital. 'She said, ""It's going to be okay, sweet girl"",' Amy Duggar, now 28, told Radar. 'She didn't sign any papers at the hospital, and we never heard from her again. It was a miracle.' The pair credit God with saving their lives in the accident. It 'made me realize that life is so precious and you should count your blessings every day,' Deanna said. 'Don't hold back on your dreams.' For Amy, that dream involves becoming a country singer, and the TLC show has followed her to Nashville as she tries to break into the music scene. She also made headlines last month after it emerged that her parents, Deanna and Terry, gave birth to her out of wedlock - a sin in the eyes of her ultra-religious family. They were 25 when they had her but didn't get married until 2006, 18 years after Amy's birth. Amy confirmed the rumors on her Instagram page. Family: Last month it emerged that Amy's parents Deanna and Terry, pictured, had given birth to her out of wedlock - a sin in the eyes of her religious family. Amy posted this image as she confirmed the rumors . Family: Deanna is the sister of Jim Bob Duggar, the patriarch of '19 Kids and Counting', pictured center . 'The tabloids are telling the truth, my mom and dad did have me out of wedlock,' she wrote. 'I'm sure [my mom] was scared, young, ridiculed, and felt ashamed.' 'Just because we are Christians doesn't make us perfect, it just makes us forgiven. Just because I share the Duggar name doesn't mean my life is perfect! 'God knew my uncle would have a hit show and that somehow I would be part of it. He knew my parents' story would be told. How amazing is that?!'","Deanna Duggar, the sister of Jim Bob Duggar, lost control of her car when she hit a patch of ice while driving her daughter Amy, then six, in 1993 .

"Wannabe hackers fought off a simulated attack on the BT Tower in London . Communications and television signals are shut down across London as a cyber attack takes hold of the BT Tower. At least that was the scenario facing a select group of self-taught hackers in a simulation to find the next generation of people to defend Britain's cyber security. The hackers were pitted against each other in a race against the clock to stop cyber terrorists taking hold of the iconic tower, with potential job offers on the line for undiscovered digital geniuses. Six teams of four were given the fake challenge of restoring power to the BT Tower, in central London, after it was 'taken over' by a cyber attack. The contestants were played a video message from the terrorists, who called themselves Flag Day Associates. The competitors, who were aged 20 to 50, then battled against each other for the right to take part in a master class, with the code breakers working to reverse the staged attack. Participants, including a welder and a ballroom dancer, worked against the clock for an hour, with one team eventually emerging victorious, CNN reported. Experts from National Crime Agency, BT, Raytheon and Airbus Group evaluated the performance of the code breakers. Paul Crichard, Raytheon cybersecurity manager, said the competition may have unearthed hidden talent: 'Well this shows how good they are, and it means it is easy for us to come and say actually this person is really talented. They just need a helping hand to get into cybersecurity . 'These are some of the best talents we have that aren't in the cybersecurity business today. These are ones who are really spending their own time to be skilled, to understand what is going on in the IT world and where the risks are, and those are the people we can't find through normal recruitment because perhaps they don't think they are good enough.'

'Of course, it is always down to the individual what path they take, but we will give them the utmost encouragement to choose the right side of the law.' Yesterday the government warned that a third of Britain's small and medium-sized businesses are vulnerable to cyber attacks, with many mistakenly believing they will not be targeted.","Wannabe hackers fought off a simulated cyber attack on the BT Tower .

"‘Whatever you do, be careful not to touch them.’ Our veteran guide’s warning is very clear as we set off to explore Europe’s most popular show cave in a way that very few tourists have before. With the light from his head torch cutting through the darkness in front of us, he’s referring to the endless number of ancient stalagmites that rise from the floor of western Slovenia’s spectacular Postojna Cave. Oil from a human’s skin can disrupt the growth of the stunning limestone formations, and our guide’s warning underscores how precious they are and how important it is to preserve them. Full disclosure: I had no choice but to grab onto a couple of them as I struggled to maintain my balance while trekking through the cave during a challenging adventure tour offered by its operators. Scroll down for video . Postojna Cave's adventure tour allows visitors to explore its magnificent tunnels, caverns and galleries without barriers . It’s late on a Friday night and everyone in my group is dressed in mud-spattered coveralls and wellies, while alternating between battery-powered and carbide torches affixed to our helmets. I tiptoe around the stalagmites as if they were landmines, and between every step I pause to marvel at my surroundings – Postojna Cave has incredible layers of detail and cavernous galleries that make its visitors feel incredibly small. It has taken tens of thousands of years for every scar to develop into a magnificent stalagmite, stalactite, column or curtain – one drop of water at a time. The last thing I want to do is stunt their growth as I cautiously crawl under low ceilings and through narrow tunnels, and climb and descend rugged hills inside the cave, which was carved by the Pivka River. For a greater challenge, visitors who opt for the adventure tour can test their endurance and climbing skills with a number of challenges . Oil from a human’s skin can disrupt the growth of the stunning limestone formations known as stalagmites and stalactites . An experienced tour guide explains the cave system to a group of visitors before embarking on the adventure tour . Deep inside the cave, at a depth of nearly 500ft, we extinguish our carbide torches and stand in complete darkness to absorb the cave's natural sounds. It was an eerie yet peaceful experiment as the silence was intermittently broken by the sound of water droplets hitting the floor – an underground symphony that has existed for millions of years. Moments later, I’m standing in awe of ‘The Brilliant’, a 100,000-year-old, gleaming white stalagmite that glistens against the glow of my carbide torch. This fascinating formation is 16ft tall, and has the appearance of a stack of marshmallows which have been melted and sprinkled it with sugar. Postojna Cave's most popular formation is a 16-ft tall stalagmite known as 'The Brilliant', which is an estimated 100,000 years old . Entering Postojna Cave in western Slovenia, approximately 31 miles from the capital, Ljubljana, is like stepping into an alien world . Postojna Cave has incredible layers of detail and cavernous galleries that make visitors, which number in the thousands, feel incredibly small . There doesn't appear to be a smooth surface in sight - other than the walkway - in a cave decorated with millions of jagged formations . Stalagmites: These formations rise from the floor of a cave thanks to constant drips of water containing mineral deposits. Most have round or flattened tips. Inside Postojna Cave, the most magnificent of them all is the 16-ft tall ‘Brilliant’, a gleaming white formation with a thin layer of pure calcite sinter. Stalactites: These icicle-shaped formations with pointed tips hang from the ceiling of a cave. They are produced as water containing mineral deposits drips through a cave’s ceiling. Stalagmites and stalactites form a pillar when they meet. Curtains or draperies: These spectacular formations form when water trickles down the roof or wall of a cave. The sheets of calcite take a wavy shape, just like folded curtains or draperies. They hang downward and tend to be very thin, but solid. Source: NOAA . This fascinating curtain, reflecting in artificial light, formed as water trickled down the roof and wall of Postojna Cave . It was just as magnificent when I revisited it the following day as my group took part in the cave's normal 90-minute walking tour that is taken by more than half a million visitors a year. With almost 14 miles of passages, Postojna Cave is one of the world’s largest karst monuments and one of the richest for limestone formations. To reach its depths, visitors are taken on a fun train ride on a mile-long track. It is the only cave with a double track railway. From the moment the train departs, it is like stepping into an alien world. White and rusty red stalagmites and stalactites twinkle in the light along the illuminated track, which leads to the main tourist section, and the network of tunnels and caverns seems to go on forever. To reach the depths of the cave, visitors are taken on a fun train ride on a mile-long track. It is the only cave with a double track railway . Visitors admire stalactites, stalagmites and pillars in a gallery known as the white hall due to the colour of the formations . This gallery, known as spaghetti hall, features thousands of string like stalactites which hang from the ceiling . The ancient Postojna Cave was carved by the Pivka River, which runs above and below ground for nearly 18 miles . Postojna Cave is home to about 100 different animals who never leave and live in complete darkness. None are more famous or celebrated as the unusual olm (Proteus anguinus), a blind amphibian which has become a symbol of the cave. It is known by many names, including cave salamander, baby dragon and human fish. With a maximum length of about 11 inches, there are thousands of the creatures within Postojna Cave, and they were first described by visitors in 1768. They can live up to 100 years and are neotenic, meaning adults keep most of their juvenile features. Aside from human fish, the cave is home to tiny spiders, tiny-neck beetles, water louses and grasshoppers. Visitors can explore Vivarium Proteus, which shows off some of the creatures found within the cave. Postojna Cave's most famous resident is the olm, also known as the cave salamander, baby dragon and human fish . There are very few smooth surfaces – jagged stalactites descend like they were driven through the ceiling, while curved stalagmites appear as though they were moulded by the careful hands of artisans. Visitors on the normal tour – available in 15 languages – have access to about three miles of the cave, including a smooth, half-mile walkway that is wheelchair accessible (it has no steps but there are some steep inclines). The temperature inside the cave is constant year-round at just under 10 C, meaning most visitors will feel comfortable in a jacket, trousers and trainers. Postojna Cave has been a tourist attraction for almost 200 years since its deeper sections were discovered by Luka Cec, a local man, and it was used by German forces to store aircraft fuel during the Second World War. Part of the cave was ruined when the fuel was destroyed by partisans, sparking a massive fire that burned for days. Preseren Square, where three bridges cross the Ljubljanica river, is an extremely busy meeting point in the heart of Ljubljana . Three days in Slovenia . After emerging from the cave, I spent my second night touring Slovenia's charming little capital, Ljubljana (pronounced Loob-liana), just 30 minutes north-east of Postojna. With the Ljubljanica river cutting through its lively centre, it lives up to its reputation as one of Europe's cleanest and prettiest capitals. Our guided tour straddled both sides of the river as we passed couples enjoying dinner on restaurant terraces, young friends sharing laughs over drinks, and a mother encouraging her young daughter to dance as a man played traditional songs on the accordion at Preseren Square. It’s an extremely busy meeting point on this Saturday night in a city that traces its roots to an ancient walled Roman city. Other stops on our tour included the odd-looking National and University Library of Slovenia, Congress Square, Ljubljana Town Hall and Ljubljana Castle, which has been transformed into a modern and hip gathering place with restaurants, cafes and a nightclub. Just six miles from Postojna, Predjama Castle is built in the gaping mouth of a cave in the middle of a 400ft rocky cliff . The castle was referred to in writing for the first time in 1202 and holds a Guinness World Record as the largest cave castle in the world . Predjama Castle offered little comfort for its residents, but it has sweeping views of a valley and the village of Predjama . On my final day in Slovenia I visited the marvellous Predjama Castle, just six miles from Postojna. This is the beauty of Slovenia. It has a lot to offer and is a small country, meaning tourists can cover a lot of ground in just a few days. Predjama Castle, meanwhile, is an incredible sight from the outside – a medieval structure built in the gaping mouth of a cave in the middle of a 400ft rocky cliff, providing ultimate protection from enemies. Inside, it offered little comfort for its inhabitants in times of peace and conflict. In addition to castle tours, visitors can explore part of a cave that is located underneath it and open from May to September. Where to eat . Proteus Restaurant: Located next to Postojna Cave Rooms & Apartments Proteus, this restaurant is a short drive from the cave. It offers traditional Slovenian dishes – hearty comfort food – with a contemporary twist and local wines. Examples include house-made pumpkin soup with foam made from pumpkin seed oil, dry-cured ham terrine, and delicious venison. Jamski Dvorec Mansion: This is a convenient stop for cave visitors, as it is just steps from the entrance. It blends regional, hearty meals with modern trends. The menu includes everything from octopus salad and stuffed veal rolls to traditional goulash or local game. Gostilna na Gradu: This cosy restaurant in Ljubljana Castle sources local ingredients to serve up mouth-watering traditional dishes such as roasted deer and pork tenderloin stuffed with cheese and spinach fried in almonds. Even the schnapps is made from flowers from the karst region. Postojna can be accessed from four international airports located within an hour’s drive: Ljubljana, Trieste in Italy and two in Croatia – Zagreb and Rijeka. Chris stayed in a furnished two-bedroom flat at Postojna Cave Rooms & Apartments Proteus, located a short distance from the cave with rooms affordably priced from €41 a night. Postojna Cave's management company, Postojnska Dama, DD, oversees Postojna Cave Rooms & Apartments Proteus, Restaurant Proteus, Jamski Dvorec Mansion and Predjama Castle.","Postojna Cave contains incredible layers of detail and cavernous galleries decorated with ancient formations .

"People diagnosed with ADHD are twice as likely to die prematurely than people without the disorder, according to new research. Those diagnosed as adults were more than four times as likely to die early compared with those without ADHD at the same age - while children diagnosed before the age of six years had around double the risk of early death. ADHD is a group of behavioural symptoms that include inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. ADHD, commonly treated with Ritalin (pictured) is a group of behavioural symptoms that include inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness . It's the UK's most common behavioural disorder and an estimated two to five per cent of schoolchildren and young people are affected by it. The increased risk of early death was driven by deaths from unnatural causes, more than half of which were caused by accidents. The study, published in The Lancet, is the first to shed light on the role of ADHD in premature death. Dr Soren Dalsgaard of Aarhus University in Denmark said: 'Our findings emphasise the importance diagnosing ADHD early, especially in girls and women, and treating any co-existing antisocial and substance use disorders. 'It is however important to emphasise that although the relative risk of premature death is increased in ADHD, the absolute risk is low.' The large nationwide study followed nearly two million people from the Danish national registers, including more than 32,000 people with ADHD, from their first birthday to 2013, for a maximum of 32 years. The causes of premature death were then assessed to compare individuals with and without ADHD and found 107 with ADHD died. Previous research showed individuals with ADHD are more likely to have a range of co-existing disorders including oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and substance use disorders. Commenting on the study, Professor of psychiatry Dr Stephen Faraone at The State University of New York Upstate Medical University said: 'For too long, the validity of ADHD as a medical disorder has been challenged. 'Policy makers should take heed of these data and allocate a fair share of health care and research resources to people with ADHD. 'For clinicians, early identification and treatment should become the rule rather than the exception. 'Although talk of premature death will worry parents and patients, they can seek solace in the knowledge that the absolute risk for premature death is low and that this and other risks can be greatly reduced with evidenced-based treatments for the disorder.' The findings also reveal that girls and women with ADHD have a higher relative risk of premature death compared with boys and men with ADHD.","New research claims those with ADHD are twice as likely to die prematurely .

"Vice Admiral Simon Lister says the Navy is overly reliant on civilians to repair its craft, which are then left limping back to port for repairs . A serving Admiral has launched a scathing attack on the state of the Royal Navy, claiming it has been reduced to a collection of broken-down ships and ageing submarines whose crews are demoralised and poorly trained. In an extremely unusual move for such a high-ranking officer, Vice Admiral Simon Lister blamed Government spending cuts for undermining the Navy’s ability to carry out its duties. Admiral Lister complained that: . Admiral Lister, who joined the Navy in 1978, is a nuclear and engineering expert. Writing in a military journal, he said: ‘The price of unrelenting operational tempo is unsustainable pressure on engineers as every opportunity for maintenance is squeezed out of busy programmes. ‘For example, the lack of operators trained to stream and recover Type 23 towed sonar. ‘Overall material readiness continues to decline. From the submarine perspective, the numbers of force elements at readiness have been driven low by late delivery of Astute [a new model of submarine] and platform ageing. ‘Support is increasingly over-reliant on [civilians] for repair. This philosophy builds in declining competence and confidence.’ Admiral Lister cited the submarine HMS Trenchant, which was due to be retired in 2011, yet completed a 333-day deployment – the longest-ever by a British nuclear vessel – over 2012-13. HMS Dauntless, a £1bn destroyer, was forced to abandon exercises in February after suffering a loss of power . A number of vessels have also had to be towed back to Britain after malfunctioning at sea. In February, HMS Dauntless, a destroyer, was forced to abandon exercises and seek emergency repairs after losing power. The 8,000-ton ship, which cost more than £1 billion to build, suffered a similar problem off Senegal in 2012, as did her sister ship HMS Daring in 2009 and 2012. Engineers were unable to fix the faults and the ships had to limp to the nearest port. In his report, published in The Naval Engineer, Admiral Lister also criticised a ‘churn and outflow’ of staff, which was coupled with ‘reduced training investment and increasing transfer of engineering responsibility to [civilians].’ The MoD said: ‘The Admiral is merely pointing out the obvious facts given the shortage of engineers across the maritime industry. 'It is a challenge to recruit and retain these skilled personnel. We are offering incentives and excellent training.’","Vice Admiral Simon Lister has attacked Government spending cuts .
Claims they have left Navy with broken-down ships and demoralised crews .
Added that force is overly-reliant on civilians to repair ageing vessels .
On a recent mission, there were not enough sailors able to use the Type 23 Frigate’s towed sonar array – needed to track Russia’s nuclear submarines.
Ships grind to a halt at sea because no time is set aside for basic maintenance before they sail – and when problems arise, crews are incapable of finding or fixing the faults.
Officers don’t receive necessary training and rely on civilian consultants to solve technical problems, causing a drain on skills.
Budget constraints mean the Navy buys second-rate equipment."
"A man accused of throwing his five-year-old daughter off a Florida bridge to her death has been ruled incompetent to stand trial, Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Judge Chris Helinger said on Thursday. John Jonchuck has been sent to a prison mental facility until he's capable of understanding the first-degree murder charges he's facing. He was arrested on January 8 after authorities say he dropped daughter Phoebe Jonchuck more than 60 feet off  the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in St Petersburg, Florida during what appeared to be a psychotic breakdown. John Jonchuck (left) has been ruled incompetent to stand trial after allegedly throwing his five-year-old daughter Phoebe (right) off the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in St. Petersburg, Florida . Jonchuck (pictured here in January) has been sent to a prison mental facility until he's capable of understanding the first-degree murder charges he's facing. The judge will get an update on his condition during a June 9 hearing . Prosecutors said two experts who've evaluated Jonchuck believe he can become mentally competent with proper treatment in six to nine months. Then, the case against him can continue. The judge will get an update on his condition during a June 9 hearing. Jonchuck's court-appointed attorneys have waived his right to a speedy trial. Jonchuck’s history of mental-health issues was raised as one of several warning signs outlined in a Department of Children and Families (DCF) report released earlier this month, according to Fox Tampa Bay. The department revealed that it had received several calls from Jonchuck’s divorce lawyer regarding his mental state. Just 12 hours before he allegedly threw his daughter to her death, his own lawyer called a state child abuse hotline warning that his client was suffering from mental delusions. But according to documents released by child welfare officials on Monday, the hotline operator failed to pass on the call to investigators because she didn't think the child was in danger. At the time he dropped the girl more than 60 feet off the bridge, Jonchuck was expressing paranoid fears that Phoebe wasn't his biological daughter . Memorials have been set up in honor of the late Phoebe. Police say John Jonchuck pulled over on the Sunshine Skyway bridge in St Petersburg January 8, pulled Phoebe from the back seat and dropped her to her death . One week earlier, another worried caller told the Department of Children and Families that Jonchuck's daughter Phoebe had been physically abused in the past. That call, however, also failed to get to DCF investigators because the operator hung up before she got John Jonchuck's address. Instead of calling back, she simply closed the case, according to the state's investigation. Police say Phoebe Jonchuck was likely alive when her father sped past a police officer, stopped on the Sunshine Skyway, pulled the girl from the back seat and dropped her to her death. Jonchuck's own divorce lawyer had warned authorities of his mental state January 7, telling the hotline operator that Jonchuck had driven to three different churches in his pajamas with Phoebe in tow and asked his attorney to translate a Swedish Bible into English. Jonchuck was also expressing paranoid fears that Phoebe was not his biological daughter, his lawyer said. Phoebe's mother Michelle Kerr is helped away from her daughter's funeral last month. Phoebe Jonchuck was in the custody of her father when he threw his child to her death . 'He's calling the office every five minutes and saying these religious things and saying the child might not be his, it just really concerns me,' the unidentified attorney told an operator, later adding, 'It's all craziness and it doesn't make any sense and he's out of his mind.' But the report noted the relatively inexperienced operator said the caller seemed more worried about Jonchuck's mental state, not the child's safety and labeled the call as 'inadequate supervision' and did not turn it over to investigators. The attorney even noted that DCF had an open investigation on the family, but the operator said she couldn't find the report and did not ask a supervisor, according to the state's investigation. The missing report came from a caller who alleged family violence, inadequate supervision and substance misuse at the Jonchuck home. 'We are reminded yet again that every process within our system should be critically examined at every opportunity to ensure that the role it plays is carried out effectively,' Carroll said in the report. A call in June of 2013 first brought child investigators to the Jonchuck home where they closed the case, agreeing that family violence threatened Phoebe. Jonchuck was arrested as a result of the call after an altercation with Phoebe's mother. He and Phoebe later moved out of the home, but the report released earlier this month noted that no services or interventions were put in place.","John Jonchuck will be sent to a prison mental facility until he's capable of understanding the first-degree murder charges he's facing .

"She might be a no-nonsense countrywoman but even the Duchess of Cornwall couldn't resist a grimace when handed a plasticised dog heart during a visit to a London vet. The heart, which did come from a real animal, had been preserved with chemicals and was being used as a teaching aid by professors at the Beaumont Sainsbury Animal Hospital. Luckily for pet-loving Camilla, the visit wasn't all animal parts and surgery, with the Duchess breaking into a smile after finding some living animals to pet. Scroll down for video . Ugh! The Duchess looks aghast after being handed a plasticised dog heart to hold . One of them was a lurcher named Dogmatix, who thumped his tail hopefully as the Duchess approached. She immediately obliged, with the dog, who was at the hospital for a routine examination, looking beseechingly up at Camilla while she patted him. Another pet waiting in the consulting room was Jessica, a fluffy feline whose less-than-impressed expression was enough to rival Grumpy Cat's. Owned by the Fluin family, the cat spent the royal visit staring moodily at the table and refused to engage with either nurses or Duchess. Camilla, who was elegant in a blue cashmere suit by couturier Roy Allen, had more luck with a bearded dragon named Nugget, which was happy to be petted by the Duchess. Gruesome: The heart, which is a real one, is used as a teaching aid by professors at the veterinary hospital . Much better: The Duchess looked far happier when meeting Dogmatix, a lurcher in for a check-up . Quick pat: The Duchess, a dog owner herself, gave the grizzled pet a pat . And one for you too! A bearded dragon named Nugget also got a quick scratch from the Duchess . Not amused: Jessica the cat, perhaps disliking being at the vets, looked grumpy throughout . Cross: The pet remained unmoved by the royal visit, despite Camilla's best efforts . Having toured the wards, Camilla ventured into the teaching part of the hospital where she encountered a familiar face - a horse named Foxhunter which had been through the same plasticisation process as the dog heart. 'I do remember seeing him jump many years ago!' said the Duchess of the horse, which was part of Britain's show jumping team at the 1948 Summer Olympics. Foxhunter, a 16.3hh golden bay gelding, took bronze during that event and went on to amass several more medals before dying in 1959. Camilla's visit to the Beaumont Salisbury Animal Hospital came as part of her work with the Animal Care Trust, of which she has been patron since 2005. Hello there: The Duchess peered into one of the clinic cages for a better look at a sick iguana . Shy: Rather than face the cameras, one ginger cat chose to hide behind its blanket instead . Model student: Jess Mullard showed the Duchess a horse head she had made from cloth . Enjoying herself: Camilla chatted to student Jade Johnson during a reception at the end of the visit . The ACT is the Royal Veterinary College’s  registered charity and it raises funds to support research into improving veterinary treatment and training budding medics. Speaking after the visit, Professor Stuart Reid, principal of the Royal Veterinary College, said: 'The generous donations to the ACT are invaluable in helping us to deliver the best possible care to our patients and world-leading veterinary education to our students. 'We were delighted to welcome The Duchess of Cornwall to our teaching hospital in Camden so that she could see just how much of an impact these donations have on the work that we do.' Meanwhile... Prince Edward survives a security scare in Belfast . Unscathed: Prince Edward had a security scare during a visit to the Titanic Belfast but emerged unscathed . Moving on: As a result, he was able to carry on to the Belfast Royal Academy to present some awards . Scheme: He was presenting Duke of Edinburgh gold award winners with their certificates . The Duchess of Cornwall isn't the only royal who has been busy this week, with Prince Edward spending the last two days in Belfast. Edward was there to present certificates to local students on behalf of the Duke of Edinburgh Awards scheme but also fell victim to a security alert.

"A couple cancelled their wedding reception after the bride-to-be was told to breastfeed their 13-week-old baby in a disabled toilet because it was 'not appropriate' in the restaurant. Emily Ellis, 26, was left in tears when a female receptionist at the Cumberland Hotel in Bournemouth told her she could not feed her young son Presley in the public area. She visited the three-star hotel last Monday with her fiancé Dan Smith to pay the £1,000 balance on their £2,500 wedding package, but they were forced to wait  for some time. 'We were there for ages and I needed to feed Presley. I asked if I could I go into the restaurant to feed my baby and the receptionist said it would not be appropriate in a public area,' said Miss Ellis. Emily Ellis, 26, was left in tears when a receptionist at the Cumberland Hotel (pictured) in Bournemouth told her she could not breastfeed her son Presley in the restaurant, pictured with her fiance Dan Smith . The healthcare assistant, who has two other young children, was then invited to use a disabled toilet, leaving her 'shocked' and 'upset'. 'I said 'excuse me?' because I thought I must have misheard her but then she repeated it again. 'I was shocked that it came from a woman. I was upset by it. When we were on our way home I had a cry,' she said. The couple were so upset they walked out and Mr Smith, a nurse, called later to cancel their wedding reception which was due to be held on July 1. When he complained to the seafront hotel he was told the  receptionist was new. The couple decided to cancel their booking at the hotel and are now frantically searching for a new venue as they are hoping to keep the same date. 'We sat down and spoke about it but I didn't think that was a good enough excuse. We cancelled the booking and are now frantically searching for another venue,' said Miss Ellis. 'They apologised but said it was because the receptionist was a trainee. I didn't really think that was a suitable excuse, what are they training their staff? The couple had visited  the three-star hotel  to pay the £1,000 balance on their £2,500 wedding package, but they decided to cancel their booking . When the couple's 13-week-old son Presley started getting restless, Miss Ellis, a healthcare assistant, asked the receptionist if she could feed him in the restaurant . 'It's not a training error, it's a human error. They wouldn't expect anyone else to eat their dinner in the toilet.' The couple had already sent out invitations to 45 guests for their summer wedding at the hotel when the incident occurred. They have received a full refund, but are concerned that they made have to pay extra for a last-minute booking. The Cumberland Hotel in Dorset said its staff were 'devastated' by the 'misunderstanding'. Pat Green, group operations manager at the hotel, insisted mothers are welcome to breastfeed in any of the public areas of the hotel. The Cumberland Hotel said its staff were 'devastated' by the 'misunderstanding', pictured is the lounge at the Dorset hotel . She said: 'We have always supported breastfeeding mothers in all public areas. We also try to provide a private facility when requested. 'The incident occurred when a new member of staff was asked by the customer if there was anywhere she could breastfeed her baby. 'Miss Ellis was at leisure to breastfeed in any of our public areas. 'It was wrongly assumed by the junior reception agent that by Miss Ellis posing the question, a private space was being sought as all public areas were in use. 'For this reason, she referred the guest to our disabled restroom, which contains a comfortable armchair for breastfeeding, and baby changing facilities. She also went to check whether there was anywhere else available for the guest to breastfeed in private. 'The hotel staff are devastated that this misunderstanding has caused so much upset and we acknowledge that this was a result of poor communication on our part. 'The agent is extremely upset and sorry and sincerely meant no offence to Miss Ellis and her partner. 'We have offered the guest a sincere apology along with a significant goodwill gesture, which the customer has declined.' She added that all staff will receive training to ensure it does not happen again. The hotel has offered the couple a complimentary two night stay with spa treatments and a three-course meal which they have turned down. Justine Roberts, Mumsnet CEO, said: 'It's bemusing that some people have a problem with breastfeeding. 'It is after all a natural, essential human process - babies need to be fed when they're hungry and women shouldn't be made to hide themselves away in toilets to fulfil that need.' Mother Lou Burns, 35, was asked to cover herself as she breastfed her baby in Claridge's hotel in December last year. She was left humiliated after staff at the five-star Mayfair hotel gave her a giant napkin to cover up as she fed her 12-week-old daughter Isadora during afternoon tea. Lou Burns, 35, was breastfeeding her 12-week-old baby (left) at the luxury Claridge's hotel in Mayfair when waiters asked her to cover up with a large napkin (right) to avoid 'causing offence' to fellow guests . Mrs Burns, who is married to comedy actor Nick Burns, was reportedly told by staff to use the napkin to avoid 'causing offence', but said she was left humiliated and burst into tears afterwards. At the time, she said: 'I was really shocked as I had never experienced this before. Through my tears I tried to explain that I was really quite cross.' Dozens of women braved freezing conditions to protest against the hotel's policy in a demonstration organised by Free to Feed - which campaigns for the 'normalising' of public breastfeeding. A group of about 40 mothers took part in a demonstration outside the five star Mayfair hotel following the incident . Classical musician Kathrine Jenkinson was banned from taking her 11 month old baby into the exclusive Oriental Club in central London, because no under 12s were allowed in. She had hoped a babysitter could look after the child in her dressing room while she played Haydn's Piano Trio in G major at the exclusive Club. Instead, the babysitter had to wait outside the venue in December last year, with Olivia Grace and Miss Jenkinson, 34,  had to leave the building during the interval to feed her baby. Classical musician Kathrine Jenkinson was banned from taking her 11 month old baby into an exclusive London hotel . Meanwhile in August Natasha Barnett, 29, from Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, was told by a lifeguard at Middleton Pool that she could not breastfeed her five-month-old daughter Olive because it was 'classed as eating and drinking'. In June 2014, a mother was asked to sit in a corner by a waitress while breastfeeding her son - to keep her away from schoolchildren eating in the same restaurant. Carrie Davies, 27, was left feeling 'embarrassed and ashamed' after staff at Global Buffet in Cardiff suggested she move while feeding her four-month-old son Trystan. Ms Davies, who was lunching with a friend, was offered a spot by the restaurant's toilets, which bosses at the restaurant say was more 'convenient' for her in light of a large school party who had started eating there. Around 70 women descended on Sports Direct in Nottingham city centre in April last year to show support for 25-year-old Wioletta Komar, who claimed she was kicked out of the premises earlier this year for breastfeeding her three-month-old son. She claims a member of staff suddenly marched over and told her that breastfeeding mothers were not welcome because of 'company policy'. The sales assistant then told her that the store had no facilities for her and suggested she should go to McDonald's which had a baby and mother room. According to the Equality Act of 2010, it is discriminatory to treat a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding.

"An inquiry into the death of Alexander Litvinenko has been shown photographs of the Russian spy walking around the hotel where he was given a fatal dose of polonium. The 43-year-old had been called to the Millenium Hotel in Mayfair on November 1 2006 to meet murder suspects Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitri Kovtun, the inquiry heard. He died three weeks later having drunk a cup of poison-laced tea at the meeting which was moved at the last minute by one of the Russian businessmen. Lugovoi and Kovtun deny any involvement in the former KGB agent's death and have failed to return to the UK to face questioning. Scroll down for video . An inquiry into Alexander Litvinenko's death was shown these images of the former spy arriving at the London hotel where two Russian businessman are accused of giving him a lethal dose of polonium . Today the London inquiry, led by Sir Robert Owen, was shown CCTV footage of the three men in the hotel in the hours leading up the meeting. It shows Lugovoi checking into the hotel on Halloween in 2006 before Kovtun arrives the following morning. The pair are seen making separate trips to the toilets some ten minutes apart shortly before Mr Litvinenko arrives in the lobby. 'Extremely high' traces of the radioactive substance found on the spy's jacket after his death were also discovered in the toilets which the men visited separately. The inquiry heard how before travelling to London, Kovtun told a friend he planned to 'lure' Mr Litvinenko to the hotel to poison him.

'While he had been in Hamburg, Mr Kovtun had made touch with one particular of his old friends from a restaurant where he used to work, and asked that person if he was aware of anybody working in in a restaurant in London,' said Andrew O’Connor, counsel to the inquiry. 'As part of that conversation he said he wanted to poison Mr Litvinenko.' Detective Inspector Craig Mascall replied: 'I think Mr Kovtun, his words were that he wanted to lure Mr Litvinenko out to a meeting in order to poison him.' On November 1, Lugovoi and Kovtun visited the late Russian businessman Boris Berezovsky to collect football tickets for a match that evening. They then appeared at the hotel to meet with Mr Litvinenko at around 4pm. Three weeks later he died in hospital of radioactive poisoning. A post mortem examination into his death was described as one of the most dangerous to have ever been carried out in the UK. The day before he died Mr Litvinenko insisted photographs be taken of him to 'prove he had been killed by Putin and by the Kremlin' Mr Litvinenko fell ill in a matter of days after the meeting. He was admitted to hospital where he died three weeks later from radioactive poisoning . Mr Litvinenko had travelled to the UK in 2000 after becoming disillusioned with Putin's Russia where he had worked in the Federal Security Service, formerly the KGB. He was granted political asylum after arriving in London with his family and later began working on a consultant basis for MI5 and MI6 according to his wife. But having alleged criminal activity in the Kremlin, he became fearful for his life and in the days after the meeting became convinced he was the target of a murder attempt. His health rapidly deteriorated, with Metropolitan Police discovering traces of the highly toxic chemical polonium-210 in addresses across London. Earlier this week the inquiry heard how he had been warned of threats against his life but 'ignored' them. Mario Scaramella told of how the pair received an email in the days before Mr Litvinenko's meeting, but that he was 'more interested in his food' than any threats. 'We started to talk about general issues and then I said ""let's talk seriously,""' Mr Scaramella said. 'He was more focused about his food than the email. 'I was saying ""This is a serious issue"". He said ""I have to check""'. Kovtun and Lugovoi deny having any part in the former spy's death.

"Three men have been arrested after a woman reported to police that she was held captive, beaten and sexually abused for two months. The Sonoma County Sheriff's Office said investigators believe Jose Angel Barajas-Mireles, of Santa Rosa, California, masterminded the kidnapping of the 22-year-old woman. Police said investigators believe that the woman was held against her will and repeatedly beaten and sexually abused in a rural home in Santa Rosa for two months. Scroll down for video . Law-enforcement officers conduct an investigation  on February 19 at the Santa Rosa property where a woman claimed that she was kidnapped, held captive, beaten and sexually abused . Three men were arrested in relation to the case on Wednesday after raiding the home (pictured above, on February 19) and questioning seven people. Though none have been charged with kidnapping, one man was charged with aggravated sodomy, aggravated oral copulation and aggravated rape . The woman, who has not been named, initially said she had been held captive for three weeks but it was revealed later that she had been in the house since the holidays. She escaped February 19 after noticing an open door in the house and sought help from the Petaluma Police Station, 15 miles from the home. 'It was brutal, absolutely brutal,' Sonoma County Sheriff's Sgt. Cecile Focha told The Press Democrat. 'The woman was terrorized.' A sheriff's SWAT team raided the home the following day and seven people were detained for questioning. It is unknown if the three arrested were part of the seven who were questioned. Barajas-Mireles, 34, is also responsible for the sexual abuse and most of the physical assaults, investigators said. The woman initially told police she had been randomly kidnapped at gunpoint from Roseland, the neighborhood where she lived, which is three miles from where she was held. None of the men were charged with kidnapping or firearms violations . He has been charged with aggravated sodomy, aggravated oral copulation and aggravated rape. His bail was set at $6million dollars, official said on Wednesday.

"The Tories will not pledge to keep the defence budget at the Nato target of 2 per cent of national income after the election. David Cameron and George Osborne are expected to fend off pressure from right-wing Conservatives and military top brass to avoid cuts. Insiders say the party’s election manifesto will instead pledge only to maintain the armed forces’ headcount and spending on equipment. At least they've still GOT boots: A European Leadership Network report published today warns the UK's defence budget is likely to fall to 1.88 per cent of GDP – its lowest level in 25 years . A report published today will warn that the defence budget is likely to fall to 1.88 per cent of GDP – its lowest level in 25 years – and below the Nato target. It will suggest that friendly nations should ‘share the burden’ of defence when a threatening Russia is increasing its military budget by 33 per cent. MPs have said the twin threats from Vladimir Putin and Islamic State make for the ‘most dangerous’ period in 20 years. The report from the European Leadership Network, a London-based think-tank, says defence spending will fall from £36.4billion last year to around £35.5billion in 2015/16. The percentage of national income spent on the military would drop from 2.07 per cent to 1.88 per cent. The report offers a preliminary analysis of defence spending in 14 Nato member states and found only Estonia will hit the 2 per cent target in 2015. Six will increase their military expenditure but they still will not meet the mark. Another six countries are expected to cut defence spending in 2015, including the UK, Germany, Canada, Italy, Hungary and Bulgaria. The report warns that ‘burden-sharing is becoming a necessity, not a choice’, as none of the Nato countries – with the exception of the US – have the ‘funding or the domestic support to fully modernise their militaries’. They also cannot ‘comprehensively develop their individual defence capacity’. It concludes: ‘More defence cooperation among allies is the only realistic way forward.’ Britain, for example, has been forced to rely on other Nato countries to search for suspected Russian submarines off the Scottish coast after the Government scrapped sea patrol planes. The report said: ‘One would have to assume that the UK will not follow through on some important equipment purchases at all, or will significantly scale back on the number of some aircraft and naval platforms currently slated for purchase.’ This could include the Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carriers, the biggest and most powerful Royal Navy surface warships, and fighter planes. Ian Kearns, co-author of the report, said: ‘This preliminary analysis of 2015 defence spending decisions in Nato shows the credibility of any European pillar of the alliance is being further undermined. Despite the rhetoric about events in Ukraine being a game-changer for European security, the reality looks more like business as usual.’ Sir Gerald Howarth, a former defence minister, said it would be ‘utter folly’ if the 2 per cent target was not maintained. ‘With all that is going on in the world, not least in Russia, it has got to be a really serious election commitment,’ he said. ‘Surely the last century has taught us the lessons of not being prepared. ‘President Putin understands strength, not weakness and at the moment we risk being seen as weak.’ He called for less money to be spent on overseas aid: ‘By not committing to 2 per cent it will reinforce the fact we are diminished and we are diminishing ourselves further. We can transfer the extra money we are spending on overseas aid on defence.’ 'Putin understands strength': Russian President Vladimir Putin at a memorial service in Moscow. Amid increasing tensions with the West, Russia is increasing its military budget by 33 per cent . Rory Stewart, chairman of the Commons defence committee, said: ‘If we drop below the 2 per cent Nato target, Putin will interpret it as a sign of weakness – Russian actions in the Ukraine show that Putin is exploiting what he perceives as lack of conviction. ‘It should be a manifesto commitment from all the parties. We need to have a very honest conversation with the public. The world is more dangerous than any time in the past 20 years.’ Asked if Britain was ready for a war with Russia, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: ‘Nato is getting ready – that is the point of the commitment to the high readiness task force and the defence expenditure. ‘Getting other countries up to 2 per cent is equally important.’","Report today warns defence budget is likely to fall to 1.88 per cent of GDP .

Banks, 41, followed up the statement with a Tweet about Phuar, who moved to the U.S. from Serbia with her family to escape the Kosovo War when she was five. Arrest: Emmanuel Rangel, 19, has been charged with the three deaths and another murder that occurred on Sunday . Puhar appeared on the 21st cycle of the reality TV show - which aired last year - but was eliminated in the 10th episode. Emmanuel Jesus Rangel, 19, has been arrested and charged with three counts of first-degree murder in the deaths, which police say were drug related, the Charlotte Observer reported. Police say the victims and their killer knew each other. Puhar had just moved in with Alvarado and Gonzaga-Garcia, TMZ reported. Authorities said they found the bodies after a tip from a 'source'. They have not said how the victims died but TMZ reported that the bodies were found after gunshots were heard. While on the show, Puhar became close to a male model on the series - but he is not the man who was found killed on Tuesday. After news of her death, the show's winner, Keith Carlos, tweeted: 'I Love You @mirjanapuhar #RIP' Top Model judge Miss J Alexander also tweeted following the tragic news, writing; 'Saddened to learn about #ANTM Cycle 21 contestant Mirjana Puhar's murder.

Everything is still under investigation. Thank you.' The message was later removed from the page. Rangel has also been charged in a separate murder that occurred on Sunday morning. He is one of three people charged in connection with a homicide at a motel in Matthews, police said. Authorities responded to reports of a shooting at 1am at the Microtel Hotel and found two men with gun wounds inside a car. One man, Rosool Jaleel Harrell, 22, was dead and the other had suffered life-threatening injuries. 'We don't know for sure' if the two cases are related, Matthews police Officer Tim Aycock told the Observer. 'It's very suspicious that the same guy is charged.' He was arrested without incident on Wednesday morning, police said. Rangel was charged with first-degree murder in that case, along with Edward Sanchez, 19. Another teenager, Emily Ann Isaacs, 18, was charged with accessory after fact. Mirjana was 18 when she appeared on the reality TV show, which aired last year, and was eliminated from the show in the 10th episode. The Serbian native was five when she moved to the U.S. with her family during the Kosovo War. With about $50 to their names, her parents ended up in New York City before moving to North Carolina around 10 years ago, she told the Charlotte Observer in an interview last year. She dropped out of high school and worked different jobs, including at McDonald's, before becoming a model. 'I was a wild child,' she told the Observer in the interview. 'I went out, had fun, partied, whatever – I didn't really have the best influences around me.' But she decided to head back to school and completed her GED at a community college just before starting on America's Next Top Model. She was the youngest contestant taking part in last year's show.

"The Federal Communications Commission has voted to approve rules that make internet services in the US should be in the same regulatory camp as telephones. This means, providers like Comcast, Verizon and AT&T, will have to act in the 'public interest' when providing your internet connection. The goal is to prevent those providers from creating paid internet 'fast lanes' and charging some sites to move their data faster than others. But how exactly will this impact your service? Scroll down for video . Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler (centre) greets commissioners Mignon Clyburn (left) and Jessica Rosenworcel at the FCC Net Neutrality hearing in Washington today . What is net neutrality? Whether you're trying to buy a necklace on Etsy or stream the season premiere of Netflix's 'House of Cards,' your internet service provider would have to load all of those websites equally quickly. Broadband and fiber-optic service providers wouldn't potentially be able to create a tiered system where companies had to pay 'tolls' to get content to customers faster. What is the FCC voting on? The Federal Communications Commission voted on whether to reclassify broadband access as a 'telecommunications service under Title II.' In simple terms, the FCC has reclassified broadband as a utility, giving it more regulatory power over internet providers. This means sites that create the content you read and watch online, won't face discrimination by network owners.  For instance, Verizon can't block Google Wallet on your smartphone, like it did in 2011. Will changing how internet service providers are regulated also change your internet bill? It's likely too early to say. FCC chairman Tom Wheeler reasons internet service providers should still retain their pricing flexibility because he isn't suggesting implementing the part of proposal that would let the FCC set rates. What's the difference between an ISP and a content provider? An internet service provider is a company that provides you with access to the internet. Major players include AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, Cox and Time Warner Cable. Netflix and Amazon, meanwhile, are content providers. An ISP can also a content provider, such as Comcast which owns NBCUniversal. If the proposal goes ahead, a video service couldn't be blocked or slowed down, for instance, because it competes with an offering from the carrier.  For instance, Verizon can't block Google Wallet on your smartphone, like it did in 2011 . What does this mean for smartphones? Even wireless carriers will fall under Title II if Wheeler's proposal. That's important given that mobile phones are becoming the primary way that many people watch online video, play games, read and shop. The FCC estimates that about 55 per cent of all internet traffic now travels over mobile broadband networks. A video service couldn't be blocked or slowed down, for instance, because it competes with an offering from the carrier. The proposal also extends to apps. Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile are developing a mobile payment system called Softcard, for instance, and blocking access to rival payment apps such as Apple Pay would be barred. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has three primary goals: to prevent internet service providers from blocking traffic to any website obeying U.S. laws; to ban 'throttling,' the practice of slowing down service for a commercial purpose; and to prevent the creation of 'fast lanes' Republican commissioner Ajit Pai warned 'that consumers that use less data may end up subsidizing consumers that use more data' A Republican Federal Communications Commission board member last month issued a doomsday warning on his government agency's plan to adopt so-called net neutrality rules. Republican commissioner Ajit Pai pushed back on the decision by holding a press conference to disparage the FCC's 332 page 'secret plan' to take control of the internet that he cautioned would bring about 'adverse consequences to the entire Internet economy.' Pai  warned 'that consumers that use less data may end up subsidizing consumers that use more data' and have 'less choice and less free data' if the plan is put into effect. 'My bottom line, if you like your current service plan, you should be able to keep your current service plan,' he said. 'The FCC shouldn't take it away from you.' Referring to the proposal as 'President Obama's plan,' Pai said it 'gives the FCC broad and unprecedented discretion to micromanage the Internet.' 'This plan gives a Washington bureaucracy a blank check to decide how Internet service providers deploy and manage their networks from the last mile all the way through to the Internet backbone.' Like other Republicans who oppose net neutrality rules, Pai said they would 'open the door to billions of dollars in new taxes on broadband' that could climb as high as $11 billion. Are Verizon, AT&T, Comcast, Time Warner Cable and others really planning to charge individual companies for faster service? The major internet service providers insist they have no plans to create such 'fast lanes' and therefore there is no need for changing the way they are regulated. They maintain that blocking or slowing down content wouldn't be in their best interests. But they do think that some companies that use a lot of data, like Netflix, might need to bear some of the cost of handling the heavy traffic they generate. Wasn't all this debated years ago? The FCC has so far enforced 'open Internet' rules with the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which was intended to encourage competition in the telephone and cable industry. However, a federal appeals court knocked down that approach. President Barack Obama and consumer advocates say a better tack would be to apply Title II of the 1934 Communications Act. Written 80 years ago with radio, telegraph and phone service in mind, that law prohibits companies from charging unreasonable rates or threatening access to services that are critical to society. Customers of Netflix, which has produced shows including House of Cards (pictured), could be charged more to stream programmes if the website chooses to pay more for a better service . So what's not to like about net neutrality? Internet service providers say they back the concept. But they don't want to face more, costly regulation and claim it would hurt the economy. Their argument is the internet has been progressing just fine the way it is currently set up, thanks in parts to their expensive investments in network upgrades that have improved the quality of high-speed service and expanded its availability. More regulation will cost them more money - money they would otherwise spend on expanding and improving their networks, they say. That would have the trickle-down effect of hurting business creation and jobs. What will happens now? It will be a long time before anything materialises. Netflix won't stream any faster for you and ISPs won't stop investing in their networks or high speed fiber cables as a result. After commissioners make statements, the rules may not be published for a number of weeks. The rules will then go under regulatory review for months. The vote won't be official until, it is estimated, summertime. And even then, major telecom companies will challenge new rules in court. Both those for and against net neutrality see a long road ahead.","Net neutrality is the principle that internet providers should give consumers access to all content and applications on an equal basis .

"A young mother who spent up to £450 a month eating in McDonald's has lost more than five stone after kicking her junk food habit. Bakery worker Lauren Wallis, who lives in Lowestoft, Suffolk, had tipped the scales at 14 stone 4lb after going to the burger chain up to three times a day. The 25-year-old would gorge on seven hot dogs in one sitting and would eat giant portions of Coco Pops out of a mixing bowl. Lauren Wallis enjoyed eating hot dogs and fatty foods but after cutting out the junk, she slimmed down from more than 14 stone (left) to a trim nine stone (right) But when Lauren reached a size 18, she was horrified after she saw a photograph of herself looking bloated on a night out. After the birth of her daughter Mia, now two, Lauren decided to join a slimming club and lost more than five stone in four months, slimming down to a trim size 8. She swapped junk food for healthy home cooked meals then decided to use Instagram to inspire others. Now Lauren is posting healthy recipes, diet tips and 'before and after' photos in a bid to help her 19,000 followers shed the pounds. Lauren, who weighed more than 14 stone (left) slimmed to an incredible size 8 (right) Lauren, pictured with daughter Mia, said she would snack on chocolate bars and eat takeaways . Lauren, who posts up to six photos a day on the social networking site, said: 'When I was at my biggest I had no confidence. I had always been chunky, but when I left school I worked as a supervisor in a call centre and my weight ballooned. 'In the morning I used to fill a mixing bowl up with Coco Pops. Then at about 11am I would go to McDonald's and have pancakes with a burger and a chocolate milkshake. 'At lunchtime I would go to Subway and get a foot-long sandwich with pepperoni and salami as well as a fizzy drink and cookies. 'We also had a vending machine in the office so I would snack on chocolate bars, then for dinner I would eat an Indian takeaway in the office or I would cook Fray Bentos pies and go to the chippy for chips to put on the side. Lauren said she would gorge on fast food every day - and tipped the scales at 14 stone before losing weight . Lauren's Instagram photographs of the meals she ate before her weight loss (left) and healthy dishes she enjoys today (right) has proved popular with other dieters . 'My eating was out of control. I could eat seven hotdogs in one sitting and sometimes I would go to McDonald's for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It was terrible. I wasn't educated in healthy eating. I would drink a lot of fizzy drinks like Coca Cola and Dr Pepper. 'I did notice my weight going up but nobody ever mentioned it to me. Whenever I went on a night out I wore dark, baggy clothes and if I wore high heeled shoes my feet would bleed and blister because of my weight. 'In May 2011 I was on a night out and the next day my friend tagged me in a photo on Facebook. I was horrified. I was massive, my arms were massive. My hair was sweaty and I had really bad skin. 'I was so unfit that I couldn't even walk to the shop without sweating. 'I decided something had to be done, so I swapped takeaways and sweet food for healthy home-cooked meals.' Lauren said she piled on the pounds when she was pregnant with Mia . Online inspiration: Lauren is now helping others to lose weight after dropping from 14 stone (left) to a svelte size 8 (right) Within a matter of months Lauren was able to flaunt her new size 12 figure in fitted clothes, and met her partner Richard Williams, 32. But when Lauren fell pregnant months later, she found herself going back to her old ways and began eating takeaways and convenience foods. Lauren said: 'During my pregnancy I started putting on weight again but I didn't really care because I was pregnant. I had gone back to the convenience foods and takeaways. 'At Mia's first birthday party I saw photographs of myself and I decided to join Slimming World. 'At my first class I weighed 14stone 4lb but within four months I had lost over five stone and I felt amazing. I now weigh 9 stone and I'm a size 8. 'Thanks to adopting a healthy lifestyle I have learned how to cook fresh food from scratch, so I thought I would use Instagram to share recipes and diet tips for other people who want to lose weight. Lauren said she vowed to lose weight after seeing herself in a picture on a night out looking 'bloated' Before losing weight Lauren said she wore black on nights out, above left, but now enjoys bright colours and fitted clothes (right) 'I started off by posting family photos and a few recipes, but more and more people started following me and I now have 19,000 followers. 'I share 'before and after' photos of myself to help inspire others and people write lovely comments complimenting me on my achievement. I really believe that if I can lose weight anybody can, and I want to show other people that it is do-able if you put your mind to it. 'I'm a working mum and I understand how hard it can be to stay on track.' Lauren, whose posts on the social media site get up to 1,300 comments and 'likes', enjoys cooking paella, spaghetti, meatballs and healthy low-fat curries for herself and her family. Lauren (left) said she is much happier since losing weight. Pictured with a friend before shedding the pounds . 'I have completely changed my lifestyle,' she said. 'I love cooking and we never eat frozen food. 'A typical food diary now is a bowl of porridge for breakfast, salad for lunch and a pasta dish or curry for dinner. 'I'm a firm believer in a treat once a week, and I still enjoy meals out with my friends or the odd bit of chocolate every now and then. 'When I go out I wear high heels and my feet don't bleed anymore and my wardrobe is an array of colour. 'I'm a much happier and more confident person now that I have lost weight and I want to inspire other people to feel the same way.'","Lauren Wallis ate seven hot dogs a day and cereals from a mixing bowl .

"Struck off: Anthony Barton, pictured today, appeared before the General Dental Council in 2009 after it emerged he regularly groped nurses' bottoms and tried to undo their bras while at work . A dentist struck who slept with a teenage dental nurse at work, told another to wear a thong under her uniform, and left a third scared to come in after he groped her has been cleared to practise again. Anthony Barton, 41, insists he has ‘grown up a lot’ since groped dental nurses' bottoms, twanged their knicker elastics and tried to undo their bras at work. The General Dental Council nearly six years ago banned him from dentistry after it heard evidence of nearly eight years of ‘sexually motivated behaviour’ - including at work sexual liaisons with a teenage colleague. But his name will now be returned to the GDC's register after a professional conduct and competence committee today decided to let him to resume his career. Announcing the decision, committee Chairman Rachel O’Connell said Mr Barton was now of good character and fit to practise - albeit with conditions for the first 12 months. ‘The Committee is in no doubt that you are remorseful and ashamed of the conduct which led to your erasure in 2009 and that you have reflected extensively over the last five years,' said Ms O'Connell. ‘You understand now how inappropriate your offensive sexual behaviour was and the impact it had on those who were subjected to it.' Mr Barton had found work as manager of a dental practice, where he had told colleagues about his past misconduct and his disqualification from the GDC register, said Ms O'Connell. ‘You work closely with the dental team at your practice, including young female colleagues. There is no evidence of any further concern or issue raised regarding your behaviour,' she said, adding that eight female dental nurses had submitted testimonials in support of his character. Mr Barton was in October 2009 found guilty of ‘unprofessional and inappropriate’ conduct towards a one young dental nurse and was struck off for ‘a serious breach of trust of several vulnerable employees’ at Red Rose Dental Group in Wigan, Greater Manchester. The twice-married dentist had carried on an at-work affair with one nurse, prancing around his surgery in a leopard-print thong and meeting the 19-year-old for trysts in his office and the toilets. The affair came to light after several dental nurses complained of unwanted touching, including one who reported that he had asked her to wear a thong beneath her uniform. The dentist, who resigned from the practice after the allegations emerged, admitted the affair to a tribunal and was found guilty of ‘unprofessional, inappropriate and indecent’ sexual conduct towards three women between 2000 and 2008. Since his disqualification from dentistry, Mr Barton had found work as a manager at a Smiles Dental in Anglesey, Wales. He told the panel this week he has to endure a daily 180-mile commute from his home in Warrington, Cheshire. ‘I have come to understand where my conduct fell short of what was to be expected,' he said. ‘It is quite clear to me now looking back that a lot of my actions were completely inappropriate and had no place in practise at all. ‘I have grown up a lot. I think I was very immature. I was very young at the time when certain aspects of the behaviour began. ‘It seems like a different person and I can’t believe a lot of the behaviour which happened.’ Barton said he was trusted to be around lone females at the surgery and there had been ‘no complaints at all’. ‘Often, there may just be myself and another member of staff’, he said. Barton also discussed taking practical and online courses to keep his knowledge of dentistry up to scratch, including ‘tutorial sessions on professionalism and ethics’. He has taken ‘90 or 100 hours’ of instruction and has even practised on dummy heads, since he is not allowed to work with real patients. ‘After an hour or two of doing it, it started to feel very natural’, he commented. Affair: Twice-married Barton also had a relationship with one 19-year-old trainee and the pair would have sex in the toilets and in his office at the Red Rose Dental Group in Wigan, Greater Manchester, pictured . Gabriel Beeby, for the GDC, had introduced the case, saying Mr Barton ‘had been unprofessional, inappropriate and participated in sexualised conduct towards four dental nurses with whom he worked’. After a five-day misconduct hearing, he was in 2009 found guilty of 17 charges relating to his treatment of the women. One victim, known only as Ms D, told the hearing of her disgust when his sexual innuendos took a physical twist and he began to ‘gratuitously grope’ her bottom in the office. She told the hearing: ‘I remember my trousers fell down a bit so I pulled them up myself. Mr Barton was standing behind me and thought that was a good opportunity to feel my bottom. ‘I think that’s the day he said I had a nice a***.’ Mr Barton admitted having a six-month affair with dental nurse Ms B and was found guilty of having sex with her during surgery hours. He was found guilty of multiple allegations of touching Ms A, Ms C and Ms D, and that his behaviour was ‘unprofessional, inappropriate and indecent.’","Anthony Barton was struck off in 2009 for sexual misconduct at work .

"A police officer who fatally shot a handcuffed man won't face criminal charges after a grand jury concluded Wednesday that the suspect was armed with a handgun police missed while patting him down. The grand jury heard from 45 witnesses and reviewed a Georgia Bureau of Investigation report of more than 2,000 pages in the shooting of 29-year-old Charles Smith last fall, Chatham County District Attorney Meg Heap said. 'I believe the decision the grand jury made should lay this to rest,' Heap told reporters at a courthouse news conference. No Charges: A grand jury concluded Wednesday that the police officer who shot Charles Smith, 29 (photographed), won't face criminal charges . Officer: Savannah-Chatham County police officer David Jannot (photographed) fatally shot Smith last September 18 shortly after he had been handcuffed and placed in the back of the officer's patrol car . Savannah-Chatham County police officer David Jannot fatally shot Smith last Sept. 18 shortly after he had been handcuffed and placed in the back of the officer's patrol car. Police said that Smith's hands were cuffed behind his back but that he managed to move them to the front of his body. Smith then kicked out a car window and tried to escape. He was able to get out of the car. The grand jury's four-page report said the officer shot Smith five times after the suspect fled the car with a gun in his hand. Press Conference: Here, district Attorney Meg Heap (left) speaks at a press conference Wednesday after a grand jury decided not to charge a Georgia police officer who shot a handcuffed man . Conclusions: The grand jury concluded that the suspect was armed with a handgun police missed while patting him down . Jannot testified Smith 'pointed the weapon as if to fire it,' the report said, and Smith fell dead with the gun several inches from his hands. Lab tests confirmed Smith's DNA in skin cells were found on the gun's grip and at the base of its ammunition clip. 'Many Grand Jurors were appalled that the police did not find Smith's gun despite the fact at least three officers are seen on video frisking him,' the report said. '... When the police are taking someone into custody who is known to carry a weapon, we would expect them to conduct a thorough search to include the crotch and groin.' Grand jurors recommended Savannah-Chatham police consider revising department procedures on searching suspects for weapons and transporting potentially violent suspects. Smith had struggled with several officers during his arrest before he was placed alone into a patrol car with Jannot. Five Times: The grand jury's four-page report said the officer shot Smith five times after the suspect fled the car with a gun in his hand . Managed: Police said that Smith's hands were cuffed behind his back but that he managed to move them to the front of his body . Skin Cells: Lab tests confirmed Smith's DNA in skin cells were found on the gun's grip and at the base of its ammunition clip . Smith, who was black, was shot by the white officer barely a month after the police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, ignited a national outcry and raised questions about how race factors into police officers' split-second decisions to use lethal force. If there's a key distinction between the two cases, it's that investigators in Missouri confirmed Brown was unarmed. Still, the shooting of Smith last fall prompted several days of protests in the streets of his Savannah neighborhood. Smith's mother, Penny Nelson, during one September rally said she didn't believe her son was armed. She added, 'Y'all shot my baby for nothing.' An attorney for the family, Chadrick Mance, said Wednesday that Smith's relatives planned to wait a few days before commenting on the grand jury's findings. 'The family is taking it pretty rough right now,' Mance said. Cameras: The shooting happened after the patrol car left the parking lot and was not captured by the store's security cameras . On Leave: Jannot, who has served on the police force for a decade, had been on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation into the shooting . Jannot, who has served on the police force for a decade, had been on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation into the shooting. Smith was arrested at a Savannah convenience store on warrants charging him with theft by receiving a stolen vehicle, eluding police, reckless driving and related counts. Video from surveillance cameras inside and outside the store showed officers patting Smith down before placing him into a patrol car. The shooting happened after the patrol car left the parking lot and was not captured by the store's security cameras. Georgia Department of Corrections records show Smith had been released from prison on July 9, 2013, a little more than a year before he was killed. Smith served less than two years of a five-year sentence for aggravated assault, cocaine possession, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. It was Smith's third time serving in a Georgia prison. The previous sentences were for theft.","A grand jury chose not to charge a Georgia police officer who shot Charles Smith, 29, while he was handcuffed .

"The selfie craze has even reached the animal kingdom, it appears. Students at Durrell Wildlife Park in Jersey have revealed these amazing images captured life in the park from the animal's point of view. Cameras were installed in animal proof boxes and put in enclosures as part of the project. Scroll down for video . While a female played with the camera, a grumpy looking male silverback called Bodongo sat grumpily in the background. The pair came up with a tossed a camera into the gorilla enclosure after encasing it in a reinforced box. The box contained raisins, so the gorillas lifted the box over their heads to shake out the food and in the process recorded themselves and their family members. They even managed to sum of life in the gorilla enclosure perfectly - while a female played with a camera, a grumpy looking male silverback called Bodongo sat grumpily in the background. Created by American students Eloise Sherrid and Zoe Lohmann, they are part of an art project the pair developed. 'They are from an ongoing video project Zoe and I are working on to promote the Trust's conservation methods and education programs,' Sherrid told Dailymail.com. 'We're both very passionate environmentalists, so as artists we decided to put our skills to use helping Durrell get recognition for the extraordinary work they do around the globe.' Sherris admitted that the gorilla picture was a particularly tough one to capture, and at one point the she was shouted at by Bodongo, the silverback, for getting too close to his son. 'I was too aggressive with my attempts to film the baby, Indigo, so his father shouted at me a few times to back off.' Jon Stark, a Senior Ape Keeper at Durrell, did an experiment a few years ago where he tossed a camera into the gorilla enclosure after encasing it in a reinforced Pelican box, so the pair used this approach. 'Together we recreated the scenario with HD video, and were able to record the silverback, Badongo, his mate Kahili, and their son Indigo. 'The box contained raisins, so the gorillas lifted the box over their heads to shake out the food and in the process recorded themselves and their family members.' Female orangutans Annette and  her offspring Jantho seemed keep to try and eat the raising hidden in the camera box. Kea, the parks 'miracle' orangutan, born to a mother who had been declared 'infertile' was also part of the experiment. 'Some of the animals, like the Livingstone fruitbats, were very comfortable being filmed up close with keeper supervision,' the pair said. 'To get to the hard to reach places, we mounted a GoPro camera to a broom handle and raised it up to the ceiling to capture them hanging from an angle not usually accessible by humans. 'The bats actually reached out a few times and tried to climb onto the stick.' The pair also went to Sorel Point, where the photographed sheep. The team created a range of cameras for the project, ranging from a protected camera for orangutans and gorillas to a pole camera for sheep. 'On this occasion we also got to meet the local flock of sheep, who were decidedly more interested in finding out if our camera equipment was edible than they were impressed by our repeated arm brandishing and attempts at scaring them off.' They are now working on editing the video footage from the experiment, which is set to be released later this year. 'We've found that documenting animals and humans really isn't that different,' they said. 'We have collected many great and memorable moments. 'However, we have also collected about 30 hours of footage along the way and are facing the daunting task of sifting through it all and finding just the right pieces to create our final collection of videos.

"A First World War soldier who was called to the Western Front at short notice made a desperate bid to say goodbye to his family by scribbling a note in a matchbox and throwing it from a moving train. Sergeant Major George Cavan hurled the message onto the platform of Carluke train station in South Lanarkshire, Scotland, and shouted to a passenger to give it to his wife, Jean. The serviceman and his unit were suddenly called to fight in the Ludendorff Offensive - Germany's last major effort to win the war - from their base in Glasgow, but didn't have time to tell loved ones. Sergeant Major George Cavan (left) hurled a farewell note for his wife Jean and their three children, Jean, Lucy and Georgina (right) onto Carluke Station platform after he was called to the front line at short notice . But just 15 days after penciling the note, Sgt Maj Cavan died after being injured in the battle, though his body was never found. The note, which read 'Dearest wife and bairns, off to France - love to you all, Daddy', was picked up by someone on the platform and given to his wife Jean Cavan. She kept the letter and matchbox for the rest of her life and handed it to her daughter Lucy who in turn left it to her daughter, Maureen Rogers. The moving account, along with the matchbox, has emerged for the first time after being published on a website dedicated to telling untold stories of the First World War. Mrs Rogers, 72, said: 'The matchbox and letter were treasured by my grandmother for the rest of her life. 'My grandfather must have thought ""how on Earth am I going to let my family know I am going to war?"" 'Luckily he had the presence of mind to write the note and throw it out of the train window at Carluke and luckily somebody picked it up and gave it to his wife. The note was written in pencil on March 29, 1918, and read: 'Dearest wife and bairns, off to France, love to you all, Daddy' 'Sadly, it turned out to be the last letter my grandfather wrote. He didn't get the chance to write home when he got to France. 'It is a very precious item which I plan to give to his regimental museum as I don't have any direct descendants to give it to.' Sgt Maj Cavan was regimental sergeant major in the 9th (Glasgow Highlanders) Battalion, Highland Light Infantry. He spent much of the war training Territorial Army units in Scotland until March 1918 when orders came through for him to make his way to France to join his unit in Flanders. He left his training camp in north Scotland on March 29 and travelled by train south to Glasgow and then through Carluke before heading for the south coast of England. Mrs Rogers said: 'The train he was on with his troops went through his home station but did not stop there. 'He threw out onto the station platform a matchbox containing the folded note on the outside of which was the name of his wife. He yelled out ""give this to Jean Cavan"" to anyone who was on the platform at the time.' He put the message in a matchbox and threw out the window of the moving train. Sgt Maj Cavan was killed 15 days after he passed through Carluke Train station, hurling the message . At the time Mrs Cavan was pregnant with the couple's fourth child, after daughters Jean, then aged four, and Lucy, two. Their eldest child, William, died at the age four from appendicitis. Sgt Maj Cavan joined up with his unit on the frontline days later and on April 11 the men were in action, after British army chief Field Marshal Douglas Haig gave the infamous order for the men to fight to the death. Due to the confused nature of the fighting, the exact circumstances of his death are not known but it is likely he was shot on April 11 or 12 and died of his wounds on April 13. Mrs Rogers, a retired dermatologist, said: 'The news of his death reached Carluke before my grandmother received official confirmation. 'She was walking down the street and a woman stopped her to offer her commiserations. 'She accused the woman of spreading lies and when she got home there was a man from George's regiment there who confirmed it. 'It was very hard on my grandmother who was left with three young children to look after. My mother was very clear with me as to how difficult it was for her.' A few years after her husband's death, Mrs Cavan and her three daughters - Jean, Lucy and Georgina - moved to Australia where she had family. After two years they returned to Scotland and Mrs Cavan began work as a night nurse while raising her children. In 1949 her second daughter Lucy emigrated with her husband John and their daughter Maureen to Sydney and Jean joined them six years later. Mrs Cavan died in 1964 while in her 70s and her daughter Lucy passed away eight years ago. A relative of Mrs Rogers was attending Oxford University and a friend of hers was working on the Great War Archive. The story of the matchbox was passed on to this researcher and appeared in the Oxford University Great War Archive and subsequently on the website Europeana 1914-1918. Sgt Major Cavan lies in an unmarked grave in Belgium and he is commemorated on the Ploegsteert Memorial near Ypres. French soldiers fighting during battle in the Ludendorff Offensive at Villers-Bretonneux, France, in April 1918 . Beginning on March 21, 1918, the Ludendorff Offensive - also known as the Spring Offensive - was a series of German attacks along the Western Front during the First World War. General Erich Ludendorff ordered the massive attack on the Western Front in a bid to end the war. The Allies were aware an ambush was imminent but did not know when it would come. There were four German offensives, codenamed Michael, Georgette, Gneisenau and Blücher-Yorck. In just five hours, the Germans fired one million artillery shells at the British lines held by the Fifth Army – over 3000 shells fired every minute. By the end of the first day of the attack, 21,000 British soldiers had been taken prisoner and the Germans had made great advances. Commander of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, issued an 'Order of the Day' on 11 April stating, 'With our backs to the wall and believing in the justice of our cause, each one of us must fight on to the end.' The German offensive began to stall and throughout the final two the side lost thousands of men and sustained 230,000 casualties - an issue it could not sustain. The last German attack came on July 15 in attempt to draw Allied reserves south from Flanders. But their fuel-starved air force had lost air superiority to the Allies, advanced no further than the French Forward Zone. The French launched a major offensive of their own on July 18, threatening to cut off the Germans. Ludendorff had to evacuate most of the men and the offensive was finally cancelled. The initiative had clearly passed to the Allies, who were shortly to begin the Hundred Days Offensive which ended the war.","Sergeant Major George Cavan hurled message on Carluke station platform .

"A businessman who crashed a 199mph Ferrari 458 Spider into a tree just four minutes into a test drive died instantly. Keith Poynton, 59, lost control when took a corner too fast in the £200,000 supercar, coming off the road and smashing into a tree, an inquest heard. There was 'no question' that he was breaking the 60mph speed limit at the time of the crash, a forensic collision investigator said, blaming driver error for the tragedy. Keith Poynton died instantly after crashing a Ferrari he had only driven for four minutes into a tree . Mr Poynton's son Tom, 25, suffered serious leg fractures in the accident in Linton, Derbyshire, last April. Tom, a cricket player for Derbyshire, had taken the car for a spin himself just moments before the crash. The Ferrari was owned by Derbyshire County Cricket Club chairman Chris Grant, who had bought the car on the day of the accident. PC Ian Phillips told Derby and South Derbyshire Coroner's Court yesterday that 'regardless of his experience', Mr Poynton would not have been able to 'sufficiently' reduce his speed before the crash on the evening of April 4. The police officer said: 'In my view, the collision occurred as a result of an error on the part of the driver, who had driven the vehicle for no longer than four minutes and, regardless of his experience, he was unable to reduce his speed sufficiently for the bend.' He added that it was not possible to estimate the speed of the car on impact, but the damage suggested it was travelling fast. The car boasts a 0-62mph acceleration time of less than 3.4 seconds. The businessman crashed into a tree after losing control while speeding round a bend on this road in Linton, Derbyshire . Mr Poynton's son Tom, a cricket player for Derbyshire, suffered serious leg fractures in the accident last April . The maximum speed at which the bend could be safely negotiated is 44mph, the officer added, but there was 'no question' the driver had been exceeding the 60mph speed limit. Tom Poynton told the inquest: 'To find out the average speed has shocked me a little. I didn't expect it to be that high. 'I would never question that my dad would put me in danger.' Mr Poynton, of Rosliston, south Derbyshire, was a director of Briggs of Burton, engineers to the brewing and distilling industries. Witness Alex Wilson saw the car travelling on Caldwell Road, and again when it came up behind him before the crash on the bend. Mr Poynton was at the wheel of a Ferrari 458 Spider, which can reach speeds of 199mph, at the time of the crash (file picture) Detective Constable Darren Parkin told the inquest: 'He looked in his mirror and saw a flash of red. 'He saw the car pass very quickly, before hearing a crumpling sound.' The front of the car was destroyed by the impact. Assistant coroner Louise Pinder concluded that Mr Poynton's death was caused by the crash. She said: 'He must have been travelling in excess of the maximum for that bend. 'There is simply no other explanation available as to why the vehicle could not negotiate the bend safely. He was, of course, aware that Tom was travelling alongside him, and that demonstrates to me that he made an error of judgement.' A spokesman for the cricket club said the family now hoped to put the inquest behind them.","Keith Poynton, 59, died after he crashed a Ferrari 458 Spider into a tree .

"Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina leveled the most direct attacks on Hillary Clinton during the annual Conservative Political Action Conference's opening day, challenging her to outline what she got done in her years in the U.S. Senate and at the helm of the State Department. 'Mrs. Clinton, name an accomplishment,' Fiorina said Thursday in Maryland, bringing a red-meat crowd of Republican partisans to their feet. 'And in the meantime, please explain why we should accept that the millions and millions of dollars that have flowed into the Clinton Foundation from foreign governments don’t represent a conflict of interest.'

'NAME AN ACCOMPLISHMENT!': Carly FIorina is taking on Hillary Clinton, daring her to list thigns she did right in the Senate and at the State Department . LEXINGTON ON THE POTOMAC: William Temple of the Golden Isles Tea Party in Georgia came to the CPAC event dressed as Declaration of Independence signer Button Gwinnett – one of a cast of colorful characters in Maryland to fire up America's political right wing . UNLOCK YOUR THESAURUS: Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee-in-waiting, told attendees of the Watermark Silicon Valley Conference for Women that they should be empowered to 'unlock their full potential' – a line Fiorina has used over and over again . 'She tweets about equal pay for women but won’t answer basic questions about her own offices’ pay standards ... Hillary likes hashtags. But she doesn’t know what leadership means.' During a question-and-answer session following her speech, Fiorina predicted that 'if Hillary Clinton had to face me on a debate stage, at the very least she would have a hitch in her swing.' The crowd went wild. Fiorina is trying to win a role in an unprecedented women-only matchup for the U.S. presidency. Clinton, the first lady-turnedsenator-turned-diplomat, is the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee-in-waiting. No woman has ever won the presidential nomination of a major American political party. But 'women are now 53 percent of voters,' she said Thursday, 'and so as I like to tell some of my Democratic friends who continue to talk about a ""war on women,"" we are not a special interest group – we are the majority of the nation.' Fiorina is the only female Republican creating any buzz as a potential presidential contender, a situation that seemingly requires daily reminders to voters that it might take a woman to beat a woman. 'Like Mrs. Clinton, I too have traveled the globe,' she said Thursday, referring to the former secretary of state's nearly unparalleled air mileage. But 'unlike Mrs. Clinton, I know that flying is an activity, not an accomplishment.' 'I have met Vladimir Putin,' she said, 'and I know that his ambition will not be deterred by a gimmicky red reset button.' That was an uppercut aimed at Clinton's first outreach to Moscow after she won Senate confirmation in 2009. Her office meant to send her to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov with a prop button labeled 'reset' – signifying a new start to U.S-Russia relations. But they reportedly took the Russian word from an electrical outlet 'reset' switch, not knowing that in Russia the fixtures read 'overloaded' or 'overcharged' when an electrical surge trips a circuit-breaker. On Wednesday night Fiorina told Daily Mail Online that Clinton's latest speech in Californai indicated that she had run out of fresh thoughts and started stealing a few. 'Hillary needs some original ideas,' she said during a reception for young activists. Exhibit A: Clinton's June 2014 memoir, 'Hard Choices,' hit bookstores with a cover that looked like a near-copy of Fiorina's 'Tough Choices' bestseller from 2007. Then on Tuesday Clinton told women at a conference in Silicon Valley – Fiorina's old domain as a former tech CEO – that they should be empowered to 'unlock their full potential.' That line has been a mainstay of nearly every Fiorina stump speech as she road-tests messages in advance of a possible presidential campaign. HI, HILLARY! Fiorina has taken to trolling Clinton, saying the former secretary of state is so short on original ideas that she's begun to steal them . DEJA VU: Clinton's 2014 book (right) bore an uncanny resemblance to Fiorina's (left) from seven years earlier . Before she launched the 'Carly for America' political action committee this week, FIorina's main fundraising vehicle was actually called the 'Unlocking Potential PAC.' 'We must unlock the full potential of every American and unleash the power of this great nation,' that organization's mission statement reads in part. Seizing on the apparently pilfered bit of rhetoric, FIorina communications director Sarah Isgur Flores quipped on Twitter: 'Guess all those foreign donations couldnt buy her an original speechwriter?' On Wednesday night FIorina was at the CPAC event, an annual half-week of catnip for tea partiers, to rally a group of young conservative activists who had sat through an afternoon 'boot camp' covering topics from candidate development to getting on television. The Texas native who now lives in Virginia is seriously contemplating a run for the presidency, and would be the most viable female candidate on the Republican side if she were to take the plunge. Her limited political experience consists of losing a 2010 California U.S. Senate race to Barbara Boxer, an incumbent Democrat, by 10 percentage points. But now she's playing up her private sector experience, painting herself as an (almost) everywoman focused on shaking up Washington. 'BOOT CAMP': Fiorina spoke to twentysomething-aged right-wing activists after an afternoon of training classes at the site of the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, which kicks off Thursday . POLITI-ZINGER: Fiorina's press secretary couldn't contain her snark on Twitter after people watching Clinton's speech noticed the cribbed turn of phrase . 'Ours was intended to be a citizen government,'she told a cheering reception of mostly college-age activists on Wednesday night. 'And what a citizen government means to me is that citizens should run for office.' 'You have lots of potential presidential candidates who are going to speak to you,' she said, previewing the three-day conference where nearly all the Republican 2016 hopefuls will appear. As deafening cheers – largely female – erupted in the hotel reception room, she quickly added, 'Me too!' Democrats are largely rallying behind Clinton – a former first lady, diplomat and U.S senator – in the hope of shattering a new glass celing just eight years after putting an African-American in the White House for the first time. Daily Mail Online asked Fiorina if she could take Clinton's female novelty off the table. 'Well,' she exclaimed with a laugh that approached a cackle as twentysomething fans crowded around her for selfies, 'it would sure make it harder for her!'","Onetime Hewlett-Packard CEO thinks she can keep Hillary off-balance, giving her 'a hitch in her swing' during debates .

"British security forces were facing difficult questions yesterday as it emerged that ISIS killer Mohammed Emwazi, known as Jihadi John, was brought to their attention five years ago. He was deemed to be so significant within terror circles that MI5 allegedly tried and failed to recruit him, and yet he was able to slip the net and begin his reign of terror in the Middle East. Born in Kuwait, he moved to London with his family aged six and later graduated in computer programming at the University of Westminster. It has been claimed that MI5 repeatedly tried to recruit Mohammed Emwazi, 26, - who has been named as Jihadi John (pictured) - as an informant and once put him on a terror watchlist to stop him leaving Britain . As long ago as 2007, Emwazi was involved in a West London offshoot of the Al Qaeda-inspired Al Shabab terror group in East Africa. Two members of that group were later to die in US drone strikes in Somalia, another vanished in a black cab despite being on a government control order and Emwazi was himself detained at the request of the British after travelling to East Africa. He claimed he was then questioned and harassed by MI5, who are said at one time to have tried to ‘turn him’ in to becoming a source. In fact, Emwazi may have come into contact with security sources as many as a dozen times over the years, The Telegraph reports. Similarities: It is thought that Lee Rigby killer Michael Adebolajo was also approached by MI5, and friends say it helped to radicalise hime . Emwazi’s case has strong similarities with that of Michael Adebolajo, one of the killers of Lee Rigby in Woolwich. MI5 tried to recruit him but then allowed him to operate without monitoring. And there were allegations last night that, as with Adebolajo, Emwazi’s targeting by MI5 may have helped radicalise him and lead him to seek revenge. In a further embarrassment for the Government and the security services, his name was discovered by investigators at the Washington Post. The security services had identified him six months ago. In other Jihadi John case developments: . Emwazi was dubbed Jihadi John by Western hostages because he was the leader of a group of British IS militants they likened to the Beatles. His menacing figure dressed in black and clutching a dagger in his left hand first appeared in an IS video last August, when he apparently killed the American journalist James Foley. He was later filmed delivering propaganda rants in the videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, father-of-two David Haines, British taxi driver Alan Henning, American aid worker Peter Kassig and Japanese hostage Kenji Goto. Freed hostages have told how he had forced them to watch Al Shabab videos in captivity. Weeks after graduating in 2009, Emwazi flew to Tanzania with friends claiming to be on a week-long safari. Emwazi, from Queen's Park, London (pictured), is believed to have become known to the British security services in 2009 when he was accused of trying to fight with Somali terror group Al-Shabaab in east Africa . But he was arrested by police upon landing in the capital Dar es Salaam, apparently after a tip-off from MI5. He was sent back to Britain, via Amsterdam, where he claimed to have been accused by an MI5 officer of trying to reach Somalia. Two British trainee medics who met Emwazi in Syria said he was always ready for war. One told ITV: ‘He seems like someone with not a lot to lose. There were incidents where he ran into checkpoints and he dealt with people in a careless, gung-ho manner with disregard for his own safety. ‘He believed passionately in this cause and he believed that killing these people was the right thing to do. ‘He had no intention of returning and never identified himself as British – he said he was Kuwaiti or Yemeni. He had no link to Britain unless you asked him “Are you British” and he would say “Kind of, I lived there for a long time”.’ They said he seemed wealthy: ‘All of his kit was expensive. Even the guns he had were extremely expensive and rare in that part of the world.’ Emwazi's links to a who's who of terror suspects that brought him to the attention of MI5 . The identity of Jihadi John was known to MI5 as long ago as September but was cloaked in official secrecy. Meanwhile, as politicians promised to hunt him down, his family were subjected to an extraordinary surveillance operation. Here, Home Affairs Editor JAMES SLACK and Crime Correspondent REBECCA CAMBER detail how Mohammed Emwazi had been on the radar of MI5 for years and had links to a who’s who of terror suspects. Emwazi claims officers from MI5 (pictured) stopped him from flying in 2010, and even tried to recruit him after accusing him of trying to go to Somalia . CONTACT WITH MI5 . In May 2009, Emwazi was stopped with two associates in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, allegedly en route to a safari. After being detained by police, held overnight and deported, he flew to Amsterdam, where he claimed that an officer from MI5 accused him of trying to reach Somalia – the stronghold of Islamist terror group Al Shabaab. Emwazi claims that MI5 representatives even tried to recruit him. On his return to the UK the next day, friends say he was again harassed by MI5, who warned him he was now on a terror watch list which prevented him from travelling to any Muslim country. Despite this, between 2009 and 2010 he travelled between London and Kuwait at least twice. In June 2010, he was detained by counter-terrorism officials in Britain who fingerprinted him and searching his belongings. The next day – to Emwazi’s fury, given he claimed to have a job and bride-to-be in Kuwait – he was prevented from flying. A possible attempt to leave London for Saudi Arabia in 2012 was also blocked. He is believed to have made it to Syria in 2013 – raising the question of whether the security services allowed him to travel on this occasion or whether he slipped the net. In total, there were an estimated 12 contacts, including telephone calls, between the security services and police and Emwazi and his family. THE LONDON NETWORK . Court papers name Emwazi as part of a terror fundraising network which was being monitored by the security services from as early as 2007. The group was involved in the ‘provision of funds and equipment to Somalia to undertake terrorism-related activity’. Members include a fanatic, known only as CE, who was placed under a control order. CE attended an Al Qaeda training camp led by Harun Fazul and Saleh Nabhan, a leading Al Qaeda figure suspected of involvement in the 1998 US embassy bombings in east Africa. On his return to Britain, CE was tasked with recruiting others to join Al Qaeda and Al Shabaab. The group also included Hamza Chentouf and Mohammed Ezzouek, who along with CE were interrogated by British intelligence officers in Kenya. Also on the list was an extremist who can be identified only as J1 – an Ethiopian accused of being a member of Al Shabaab and a close associate of one of four bombers who attempted to cause mass casualties on the London Underground on July 21, 2005. Links: Escaped terror suspect Ibrahim Magag . THE CONTROL ORDER ABSCONDEE . Emwazi also moved in the same circles as Ibrahim Magag, a Somali-born former train conductor from London involved in arranging ‘financial support for Al Qaeda’. Magag was put under a control order to stop him fleeing overseas to join a jihad. But on Boxing Day, 2012, he vanished. He has never been caught and officials believe he went to join British jihadists in East Africa. Magag had a history of tampering with his monitoring equipment, lying about why he was late reporting home for a night-time curfew and using a computer in breach of the terms of an order that was designed to protect national security – but he still managed to slip through the net. THE DRONE STRIKES . Also among Emwazi’s associates was Bilal el-Berjawi, a Londoner of Lebanese origin and Al Shabaab recruiter. He was quizzed by MI5 in 2009 over plans to blow up a Kenyan shopping centre in an attack sanctioned by Osama bin Laden. El-Berjawi was killed by a drone strike in Somalia three years ago. A few weeks later, British-born Mohamed Sakr, another Emwazi associate, from west London, was killed in a strike over Somalia. He had UK-Egyptian nationality, but the Government stripped him of his British citizenship shortly before he was killed. Likeness: Adebolajo was also spoken to by MI5 . SIMILARITIES WITH THE KILLER OF LEE RIGBY . Michael Adebolajo, like Emwazi, was well known to MI5 after cropping up in five inquiries, two of which were ‘priority one’ investigations – the most serious classification. Adebolajo went to Kenya in November 2010, where he was arrested on suspicion of attempting to travel to Somalia to join Al Shabaab. He appeared in court in Kenya but was not charged and returned home. His then–lawyer claimed he was freed on the recommendation of the British High Commission, avoiding formal deportation. Adebolajo told the Old Bailey there was ‘more to the story’ – hinting that, like Emwazi, MI5 had tried to recruit him as a source. Friends claim contact with the security services contributed to turning him towards violence. THE LONDON MOSQUE . In a statement last night, the Greenwich Islamic Centre denied that Emwazi had offered prayers there, but said it was its ‘clear understanding’ that he may have visited the mosque ‘like tens of thousands of people do every month’. The centre has been plagued by extremism in the past. It took action to remove hate preachers Omar Bakri, Anjem Choudary and Usman Ali, who allegedly used the premises to show children video footage of the 9/11 atrocity while chanting ‘God is great’.","Mohammed Emwazi, from Queen's Park, London, named as Jihadi John .

"Four children were killed in a raging fire that broke out at a house in rural Manitoba, Canada, Wednesday night, despite their parents' desperate efforts to rescue them. The victims' mother was able to pull her three youngest children - two girls and a boy - to safety, but her older children became trapped in an upstairs bedroom and perished in the flames. The young survivors of the blaze are currently staying with neighbors, as both their parents are in a hospital being treated for smoke inhalation. Full of life: Four children, identified as 9-year-old Henry, 10-year-old Danny, 12-year-old Timmy and 15-year-old Bobby Froese, were killed in a raging house fire in rural Manitoba, Canada .

Burned to ashes: A firefighter uses a hose at the scene of a fatal house fire near the rural community of Kane, Manitoba, Wednesday . Emergency response: Some 20 volunteer firefighters in four trucks responded to the scene after getting a call from the homeowner, but the flames were too intense for them to enter the burning structure . Ravaged: The 90-year-old two-story wooden farmhouse burned to the ground, leaving four children dead . The victims have been identified by Global News as 9-year-old Henry, 10-year-old Danny, 12-year-old Timmy and 15-year-old Bobby Froese. The boys' mother, 34-year-old Doralee Eberhardt, was home when the fire broke out at around midnight. The woman's partner, Jake Froese, and her 18-year-old son were away at the time working a late shift. Kane Fire Chief Bernanrd Schellenberg says the family's 90-year-old farmhouse in southern Manitoba was already engulfed in flames by the time volunteer crews got to the scene. He says firefighters couldn't get inside because the flames were burning so hot and there was too much smoke. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police say the blaze broke out early Wednesday near the tiny community of Kane, about 60 miles southwest of Winnipeg, Manitoba. When Jake Froese and his eldest son returned home after midnight and found it engulfed in flames, they called 911 and then attempted to reach the children trapped upstairs using a ladder, but by that time it was too late, according to a neighbor. Some 20 volunteer firefighters in four trucks arrived at the remote farmhouse at around 2am, only to find the two-story wooden structure consumed by fire. Neighbor Kristy Penner tells CBC.ca she found the couple's three youngest children crying inside a car next to their mother. their father was standing nearby, covered in soot. Doralee Eberhardt and her partner are Mennonites. Some of their brood were home-schooled, while others attended local schools . According to Environment Canada, the temperature in the area Wednesday night was just under -16 degree. Ralph Groening, the reeve of the tight-knit rural community, tells the Toronto Star the youngest members of the family, including a one-year-old, slept on the ground floor of the home, while their older siblings were lodged upstairs. The reeve said the family is Mennonite, and some of their children were home-schooled while others attended the tiny Lowe Farm and Rosenort schools. Counseling services have been made available to the classmates of the four young victims and the firefighters who responded to the scene. The local community has rallied around the bereaved family since the tragedy, offering them financial help and a temporary place to stay.","Fire broke out inside 90-year-old two-story wooden farmhouse located in rural Manitoba, Canada .

"A childhood friend of a Utah doctor charged with killing his ex-wife testified on Wednesday that John Brickman Wall blamed the woman for ruining his life. Klaus Fiebig said he spoke to his old friend several months before her death, and the pediatrician seemed centered around his hate for ex-wife Uta von Schwedler. 'At the end he said something peculiar: 'Would it be bad if Uta wasn't here anymore?' ' Fiebig said. 'She didn't plan to move away.' John Brickman Wall (center) listens to his defense attorney Jeremy Delicino during the his trial in Salt Lake City on Monday . Von Schwedler, a 49-year-old cancer researcher, was found dead in a bathtub full of cold water in September 2011. A medical examiner found that she drowned, but she also had a fatal dose of anti-anxiety medication in her system. He stopped short of ruling her death a homicide or a suicide. After her death, Fiebig spoke with Wall again following a memorial service. Wall had shaved his head in mourning, but he was still fixated on how much he hated her, Fiebig said. The day she was found, Wall came into work with a bloodied eyeball and scratches on his face, his former office manager testified Wednesday. Wall said he'd slept outside on his porch, and his dog got spooked and stepped on him, Kathi Newman said. 'I remember looking and thinking that just seemed strange to me,' she said. Von Schwedler's death was initially treated as a suicide, but her family and friends pushed for more investigation. Wall was arrested more than a year after her death. Prosecutors allege the 51-year-old Wall killed his ex-wife during a bitter custody battle. Defense attorneys counter that she could have killed herself. His trial began last week and is expected to last a month. Defense lawyer Fred Metos (left) questions medical examiner Dr. Erik Christensen. Christensen said that an autopsy  initially indicated a suicide, but suspicious wounds pointed to a homicide . Fiebig said Wednesday that he introduced the couple, who wed in Malibu in 1990 and moved to Salt Lake City a few years later. The relationship went downhill after the move, with fights that grew increasingly ugly on both sides. 'They didn't stop where it hurt,' he said. Von Schwedler eventually started another relationship before their divorce, he said. After the 2006 split, Wall became increasingly difficult at work, his former medical assistant testified Wednesday. 'He just slowly became disconnected,' Christina Gardner-Smith said. Judge James Blanch speaks to the jury during the trial of John Brickman Wall. On Wednesday testimony was given by a childhood friend of the accused and a former employee . Wall was very well liked when she first started working for him, she said. She went through a divorce around the same time, and the two used to joke about hiring a hit man to take care of their respective ex-spouses. But later, he started lashing out at her if something went wrong. Gardner-Smith stopped working for him about three years later. 'I just couldn't do it anymore,' she said.","A childhood of friend of John Brickman Wall, who is accused of murdering his ex-wife, testified that Wall blamed her for ruining his life .

"Scroll down for video . The so-called stealth jet costing the MoD billions of pounds can, in fact, be seen by the radar of potential enemies, it has been revealed. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter has been designed at huge expense to fly unnoticed through enemy airspace and attack targets without being detected. Taxpayers have already spent £1.3 billion developing the jet, while the MoD plans to buy 48 of them at a cost of up to £100 million each. Huge cost: Taxpayers have already spent £1.3billion developing the F-35 jet, while the Ministry of Defence plans to buy 48 of them at a cost of up to £100million each . But now, defence experts have revealed that the aircraft can be spotted by Russian and Chinese radar systems. Elizabeth Quintana, from the Royal United Services Institute, confirmed the stealth capability has been compromised and that the UK’s foes are poised to take advantage. She said: ‘There has been an evolution of radar technology and yes, we should be worried. The Russian air defence system might be able to spot the F-35 while the technology fitted to Chinese destroyers is concerning because you will have greater resolution and you will be able to tell with greater certainty what the plane is. ‘The key question is whether the  F-35 would be able to engage first, before being spotted. How the aircraft is operated in combat will come into play. 'The Russians are making a big push in anti-aircraft technology while the combination of technologies being used by the Chinese is interesting.’ Mrs Quintana agreed that the F-35’s stealth capability had been one of its main assets. Asked how much of a blow the stealth problems are, she added:  ‘It depends what you think you’re going to come up against. You take your chances. 'The Army will argue that there is no point spending all this money and that we should be spending more on body armour and tanks.’ Future: The jets will fly from the Royal navy's new Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carrier in 2018 at a cost of £4.8billion . Defence Secretary Philip Hammond is committed to buying 48 of the jump-jet variants of the aircraft to fly from the Royal Navy’s new Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carriers from 2018, at an estimated total cost of £4.8 billion. Until now the F-35’s invisibility – called ‘Very Low Observable’ or VLO stealth – had been achieved through its shape and paintwork, the formula for which is highly classified. Stealth aircraft use flat surfaces and sharp edges to deflect radar signals and evade detection. The new threat  to the F-35 comes from a new system called AESA – Active Electronically Scanned Array – which works by emitting separate radio waves on different frequencies. By rapidly changing frequencies, the radar is more difficult  to fool. China has incorporated AESA into a new radar system which it is fitting to its latest warships. The system is apparently capable of locating a stealth aircraft within 220 miles. Military experts claim the jet, which is also used by the US Air Force, can be picked up on Russian and Chinese radars . Meanwhile, UK and US fighter pilots are continuing to test fly prototypes of the F-35 at Elgin air base in Florida. Test flights have also revealed computer software problems and performance issues when the aircraft is flown in bad weather – including fears that the jet could explode if struck by lightning. Pilots have also criticised their high-tech helmets. The jet, which as a top speed of 1,300mph and a maximum range of 1,450 miles, combines technologies developed by British and US companies, including BAE, Rolls-Royce and Lockheed Martin, which is assembling the jets. Last night, the company was unavailable for comment, but the MoD said: ‘[F-35] is the most advanced combat jet in the world, and from 2018 will provide the Royal Navy and RAF with unprecedented stealth capability  as well state-of-the-art sensors and weapons. The aircraft has been specifically designed to be updated throughout its lifetime to ensure it  can benefit from new technology to counter emerging threats and keep ahead of our enemies.’","F-35 Joint Strike Fighter can be spotted by Russian and Chinese radars .

"An independent autopsy of an unarmed Mexican man killed by police in Washington state has produced different results from what investigators have reported, with at least two of the seven shots that struck him entering from the back, an attorney for the man's family said Thursday. The independent results were released one day after law enforcement officials said that their autopsy had shown Antonio Zambrano-Montes, 35, was hit five or six times, but none of them from behind. The special unit investigating the February 10 shooting in Pasco said the three officers involved in the shooting fired a total of 17 bullets at the orchard farm worker. However today Charles Herrmann, the new lawyer representing the victim's estranged wife and two daughters, said the secondary results showed a disparity with those produced by police. Scroll down for video . Shot in the back: The three officers involved in the death of Antonio Zambrano-Montes (pictured) shot him seven times, with two of those bullets hitting him from behind, a new autopsy has revealed . Officials: Kennewick Police Sgt. Ken Lattin talks to reporters on Wednesday, February 25, 2015. Lattin said the three officers involved in the death fired 17 shots, including several that struck Zambrano-Montes, but no shots hit him in the back . A regional law enforcement task force is investigating the killing of Zambrano-Montes, which has led to protests and calls for a federal probe. Police said Zambrano-Montes was throwing rocks at the three officers, one of whom was Hispanic, and ignored commands to surrender. The Mexican immigrant's death has prompted calls for a federal investigation and two weeks of demonstrations in Pasco, an agricultural center with 68,000 residents. Herrmann commissioned the second autopsy, which was conducted February 20 by a Seattle pathologist. Franklin County Prosecutor Shawn Sant didn't immediately return a call seeking comment on its findings. At a news conference Wednesday, Kennewick police Sgt. Ken Lattin said preliminary results of the official autopsy showed Zambrano-Montes was shot five or six times, but 'there were no shots in the back.' He said three officers fired a total of 17 shots at the former orchard worker. Suit: The family sued the city for $25 million but has since been withdrawn as the family's attorney claims the case needs further investigation photographed is Zambrano-Montes' mother . Lattin, a spokesman for the regional law enforcement task force examining the shooting, said he couldn't be more specific about where on Zambrano-Montes' body he was shot, because full autopsy results are pending. Zambrano-Montes was throwing rocks at passing vehicles and later at responding officers, authorities say. Video taken by a witness shows the man running from Pasco officers. As the officers draw closer, he stops and faces them. Multiple pops are heard, and he falls to the ground. Lattin said officers fired stun guns at least twice but failed to stop Zambrano-Montes before using their weapons. The officers felt threatened, police said. Zambrano-Montes' death at a busy intersection has sparked two weeks of protests in the city where more than half the residents are Hispanic but few are members of the police force or the power structure. Authorities say a stun gun failed to subdue the man . Moving Away: Authorities say a stung gun failed to subdue the man and the shooting, captured on video, appears to show the man moving away from police when he was shot . Surrender: Police said Zambrano-Montes was throwing rocks at the three officers, one of whom was Hispanic, and ignored commands to surrender . About one hundred friends and family members attended a funeral for Zambrano-Montes Wednesday. Demonstrators have accused Pasco police of using overly aggressive tactics when dealing with those in the Hispanic community. Protesters have equated the shooting to that of the unarmed black men killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri and New York City. Civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, who represented the families of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and Tamir Rice, was representing Zambrano-Montes family but the family has since received new counsel. The family's case was taken up by Seattle attorney  Herrmann, theLatin Post reports. The family sued the city for $25 million but has since been withdrawn as the family's attorney claims the case needs further investigation into the police department's policies. Authorities say the Mexican immigrant was throwing rocks at officers and a stun gun failed to subdue him. The Franklin County coroner has ordered an inquest into the death, which is being reviewed by the task force. The investigation is being monitored by federal authorities. Lattin said the local investigation will be thorough and fair. 'We're not here to cover up for anybody,' he told reporters. The killing was the fourth by police in less than a year for fast-growing Pasco, a city of 68,000 where more than half the residents are Hispanic but few are members of the police force or the power structure. Officers were exonerated after similar investigations in the first three cases. Critics of the latest case say the officers should have used less than lethal force to capture Zambrano-Montes. Police said officers felt threatened. Zambrano-Montes was arrested last year for assault after throwing objects at Pasco officers and trying to grab an officer's pistol, court records show. Protests: The death has sparked two weeks of protests in this agricultural city along the Columbia River in the southeastern part of the state .","Antonio Zambrano-Montes was shot at 17 times by Pasco police officers .

"A single New York mother has defended her decision to give birth to her second child at the age of 51, claiming that she is 'feeling super healthy' and that she now has the 'perfect family'. Tracey Khan, a successful publicist who lives with her two daughters in a $1 million apartment on the Upper East Side, welcomed her second child, Eloise Becket, on February 18, having given birth to her first baby Scarlett in May 2012. 'I’m beyond thrilled, the happiest I’ve been in my life,' Miss Khan told the New York Post of her new arrival. 'I’m feeling super healthy, and the baby is beautiful.' Happy families: Tracey Kahn has defended her decision to give birth to her second daughter Eloise (pictured) at the age of 51 . New arrival: The Manhattan-based publicist welcomed her second child on February 18 and revealed to the New York Post that both she and her new daughter are 'healthy' and happy . Both Eloise and Scarlett were conceived via IVF and are both the product of donor eggs and donor sperm. However the same donors were used for both pregnancies, meaning the girls are actually biological sisters. But while Miss Kahn went through her first round of IVF to conceive Scarlett at the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York - at the age of 49 - the clinic refused to give her IVF treatment the second time around because she was too old to qualify under their regulations. The businesswoman therefore enrolled for treatment at the Manhattan-based Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York, a fertility clinic which specializes in treating women who are over the age of 50 and works with mothers as old as 55. And despite her age - which some have claimed is too old to give birth to a child - Miss Kahn insists that both her pregnancy and her daughter Eloise's arrival went exactly according to plan. The little girl weighed a healthy 7 pounds and 6 ounces when she was born via C-section at the New York-Presbyterian Hospital at 10:37am. 'Towards the end of the pregnancy, I was getting a little uncomfortable because of the extra weight, but otherwise it was pretty good,' Miss Kahn added. The mother-of-two was also thrilled to add that her eldest daughter Scarlett is overjoyed to have a little sister - and even delivered a handmade card to her younger sibling at the hospital the day after she was born. Miracle baby: Both of Miss Kahn's daughters were conceived via IVF, and both are the product of the donor eggs and sperm taken from the same donors, meaning they are actually biological sisters . Independent woman: The businesswoman boasts an incredibly successful career and lives with her two daughters in her $1 million Upper East Side apartment . Miss Kahn confessed that two-year-old Scarlett was 'a deer caught in the headlights' when she first caught sight of her newborn sister, but quickly came around and 'now she absolutely adores her'. Earlier this year, Miss Kahn, who is breast-feeding her newborn, admitted that she had employed a $350-a-day baby nurse to help her care for Scarlett during her first few months, and revealed that she now employs a full-time nanny to look after her daughter while she continues to work a full-time job. But while the businesswoman admitted that the costs involved in sourcing such hands-on chldcare are expensive, she added that, with an annual business turns over of $500,000, it is a luxury she can easily afford . Miss Kahn isn't, however, closed to the idea of finding a father for her two children, and is confident that she will one day find someone that they can share their life. 'There are so many positive things to having a baby this late in life,' she said. 'Yes, I’m older, but I’m in great shape. I have a great head on my shoulders, with a great system of friends. '...Would I love to get married and give my daughters a father one day? Absolutely. That’s next on my bucket list.'","Manhattan publicist Tracey Kahn welcomed her second daughter, Eloise Becket, on February 18 .

"James Bond may have favoured Aston Martin’s road cars, but the firm has produced its most extreme supercar yet. Called the Vulcan, the track-only car has 800 brake horse power, which is much more powerful than the DBS that James Bond drove in last film. Aston Martin says the limited edition supercar, which cannot be driven on roads, is built for ‘extreme performance’ and even comes with a driving lesson so its new owners can control it. Scroll down for video . Pure power: Aston Martin has unveiled its track-only car called the Vulcan, which has 800 brake horse power. Only 24 will be made and each will cost £1.8 million ($2.3 million) – although customers will be able to choose from an ‘almost infinitely flexible’ variety of colours and trims. A computer rendering of the car, which will be unveiled at the 85th Geneva International Motor Show on March 3, is shown .

"A rogue European eagle owl is causing terror in a Dutch town after launching a series of swooping attacks which have left many locals requiring hospital treatment. Residents of Purmerend have been advised to arm themselves with umbrellas when going out at night after a mysterious spate of bloody owl assaults over the last three weeks. The disconcerting news follows similar stories this week about Synwell, another European eagle owl, who routinely terrorizes residents of Wotton-under-Edge in Gloucestershire and recently broke a 70-year-old woman's arm. Rogue terror: A European eagle owl is causing havoc in a Dutch town after launching a series of swooping attacks. The owl is pictured under a building's roof in Purmerend, above . His Dutch cousin launched an aerial assault at an athletics club on Tuesday evening, which left one person requiring stitches for six head wounds caused by the nocturnal bird of prey's talons. The club in Purmerend, northern Holland, has cancelled all training until further notice. Residents and workers at the nearby Prinsenstichting home for the handicapped have been left terrified following at least 15 attacks, according to the home's spokesman Liselotte de Bruijn. She said: 'During the day there's no problem, but at night we now only venture outside armed with umbrellas, helmets and hats, anything really, to protect ourselves. Dangerous: One of the attacks left a victim requiring stitches for six head wounds caused by the nocturnal bird of prey's talons . 'The problem is that you don't hear the owl before it strikes. Its claws are razor-sharp. We hope the city will soon catch this rogue bird.' Purmerend city council said it was trying to find a solution, adding: 'We want to catch the owl as our city's residents are in danger.' On its website it noted  however that the European eagle owl is a protected species that requires special permission to be trapped. 'These procedures can still take some time. Meanwhile, we are advising people to stay away from the owl,' the city said, telling night strollers in the area to shield themselves with umbrellas. Gejo Wassink of the Netherlands' OWN owl foundation said the female bird's behaviour was unusual. He said: 'Either the owl was reared in captivity and released into the wild and now associates humans with food - meaning it's not really 'attacking' people. 'Or it may have heightened hormone levels as the breeding season starts, which influences its behaviour and makes it defend its territory.' He pointed to the wider problem of people hand-rearing owls and then releasing them into the wild when they become too big to handle, potentially leading to an increase in attacks. The European eagle owl is one of the largest owl species, with a wing-span of around six feet and weighing up to 4kgs. In Wotton-under-Edge in Gloucestershire, another of the breed, Synwell, has been terrorizing residents and recently broke a pensioner's arm. Synwell the owl has been swooping down on frightened residents in Wotton-on-Edge in his search for a mate. Left, he lands on Graham Ellis in his garden and right, Sue Dunn, whose arm was broken by his wings . Sue Dunn, 70, a retired nurse, ended up with the injury after she caught sight of Synwell’s enormous orange eyes one night and tried to photograph him perched on a lamppost, hooting. Length: (65-70cm/26-28in). Wingspan: (160-190cm/5ft3-5ft11). Weight: Up to 4kgs. Habitat: Mountain cliffs, ravines and rocky forested terrain (Europe and Russia). Breeding: 2-3 eggs from February to May. 32-35 day incubation . Prey: Rabbit, hares, game birds, foxes, young roe deer and other birds of prey. The largest prey recorded being taken is a roe deer weighing 13kg. UK numbers:  Extinct in UK since 19th century. Recent reappearance may be a result of escaped captive birds. ‘He was making such a noise, so I went outside and shone my torch on him to try to get a picture,’ she said. ‘He didn’t seem to like that. He drew his wings up and took off – flying straight at me.’ She tried to run back to her house but while dodging the bird, which stands over 2ft tall and weighs as much as a small dog, she tripped and fractured her right forearm as she broke her fall. ‘If he was being romantic, he should have gone to Specsavers. I had no time to run from him, he just dive-bombed me. He’s certainly got no fear of humans,’ she said. It is the latest in a series of incidents in Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire, involving Synwell, who was named after an area of the town by locals. Despite his misadventures, the bird has become so popular since he took up residence two years ago that residents have created a Facebook page for him to record sightings, incidents and photographs – and he has amassed 457 followers. The owl perched atop a tree in the Gloucestershire village. Synwell has left other residents with claw marks on their foreheads and in fear of being swooped upon .","Residents of Purmerend are advised to arm themselves with umbrellas .

"Shocking details of Australian high school leavers' plans for Schoolies have been revealed, which include drinking alcohol all day and sleeping with 'sl**s' and 'h*es'. A survey done by researchers at Curtin University in Perth, Western Australia have collected the responses from both male and female students in Year 11 and 12. While the vast majority of school leavers wanted to spend their time at Schoolies celebrations 'making memories' and 'having fun with friends', Dr Simone Pettigrew - from the university's School of Psychology - said she was disturbed by the 'derogatory remarks' made by teenage boys. Scroll down for video . A survey done by researchers at WA's Curtin University have revealed the wild plans of school leavers for Schoolies . 'The boys were very vulgar about their behaviour towards girls... sex was huge part of their experience at Schoolies,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Dr Pettigrew gave examples of things the teenagers when they were asked what they would be doing at Schoolies. She said responses included 'f**k all the sl**s and drink so much alcohol until I pass out', 'f***ing a lot of bunch of little sl**s', 'drinking p*** and f***ing biddies' and 'getting drunk and f***ing hoes'. It coincides with a new study penned by Dr Pettigrew and other researchers called Understanding and addressing the Schoolies phenomenon, which was published in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health on Thursday. It coincides with a new study penned by Dr Pettigrew and other researchers, which show what Schoolies was like for graduates . Their research gained an insight what Schoolies experiences were like for graduates to try and was done for the purpose of helping to shape liquor laws. In Western Australia, adults supplying alcohol to minors is not illegal. Face-to-face interviewees - between the ages of 18 and 21 - revealed days and nights of heavy drinking, what boys' behaviours were towards girls and alternatives to the typical Schoolies experience. One female, known only as Amanda, said there was a lot of heavy drinking during her week-long celebration. 'Alcohol's role at Schoolies was the enabler, the joy maker, the medicine, the object of trade, the breakfast, lunch and tea, the dessert. Basically, alcohol was all Schoolies was,' she said. Their research gained an insight what Schoolies experiences were like for graduates to try and was done for the purpose of helping to shape liquor laws . It was the same story for a interview subject, David, who said alcohol played a 'major factor' in the party environment. 'From the moment we arrived, we consumed alcohol until extremely intoxicated. We continued until we eventually passed out,' he said. 'And when we woke up, we would start the morning with shots. This became the norm for the remainder of the week.' Dr Pettigrew said the attitude young people had towards alcohol needed to change. 'There is a need to for us to come up with a different definition of adulthood,' she told Daily Mail Australia. '[Young people need to know that] amazing attributes [are what makes you an adult], not how much you can drink and how fast.' A lot of face-to-face interviewees in the published study said Schoolies involved drinking a lot of alcohol . What surprised the researcher most about the study was the intensity of the responses were what surprised her the most. Dr Pettigrew said she knew about some of it from talking to her friends and their children. '[But] it's probably at a higher level than we believe than [what is discussed] on a day-to-day level with our peers,' Dr Pettigrew told Daily Mail Australia. 'Also the creativity that went into the planning and preparation for [Schoolies] to win the battle against authority, and the complicity of the parents who were aware and they were actively assisting them to do the hiding.'","Teens revealed plans in an online survey done by Curtin University in WA .

"A pilot's ambitious plan to fly around the world using just solar energy took a step closer this week. Andre Borschberg took off from Abu Dhabi and completed the first test flight of his Solar Impulse 2 plane ahead of next month's 22,000-mile trip. During the 12-hour flight he soared over the Sheikh Zayed Mosque, the Landmark skyscraper and Capital Gate. Scroll down for video . Swiss pilot Andre Borschberg took off from Abu Dhabi and completed the first test flight of his Solar Impulse 2 ahead of next month's round-the-world trip. During the flight he soared over the Sheikh Zayed Mosque (pictured), the Landmark skyscraper and Capital Gate . The single-seater airplane has been designed to fly day and night without a drop of fuel and Mr Borschberg - along with fellow founder and pilot Bertran Piccard - will attempt the global trip within weeks. They will depart from Abu Dhabi before flying over the Arabian Sea, to India, Myanmar, China, then across the Pacific Ocean. The solar-powered airplane made its maiden flight in Switzerland in June last year. The single-seater aircraft is made of carbon fibre. It has no fuel on board and weighs around the same as a car at 382 stone (2,300kg). With a wingspan of 236 ft (72 metres), it is larger than a Boeing 747-8I jet liner. The 17,000 solar cells built into the wings supply four electric motors (17.5 CV each) with renewable energy. During the day, the solar cells recharge lithium batteries weighing 2,077lbs (633 kg) which allow the aircraft to fly at night and therefore to have virtually unlimited autonomy. From there they will stop over in the United States, travel over the Atlantic Ocean to Southern Europe or Northern Africa before finishing the journey by returning to the initial departure point. The groundbreaking 22,000-mile (35,000km) trip, is expected to take five months. The engines of the plane - which has a wingspan of 236ft (72 metres) - will be powered solely by solar energy.

The tragedy shocked the nation and a plan was put in place by Vice-Admiral Robert FitzRoy to establish 13 instrument stations to relay readings via telegraph to London. Gale warnings were also issued at each station by hoisting flags to warn sailors. Today the forecast is produced by the Met Office for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and airs four times daily - at 12.48am, 5.20am, 12.01pm and 5.54pm - on BBC Radio 4. Despite the fact the terminology of the sea areas can . appear nonsensical to the uninitiated, it attracts a far wider . audience because of the distinctive - and some would say hypnotic - . sound of the broadcast. The problem continued on into the 5.30am airing of News Briefing until it finally cut back to the Radio 4 programme at 5.40am when presenter Kathy Clugston apologised for the glitch. She said: 'Your listening to BBC Radio 4. Our apologies. It's 5.40am and we've been broadcasting happily News Briefing. 'But unfortunately due to a technical error, you've not been hearing us, so you have been hearing the BBC World Service. 'We're sorry about that. We're looking into it and we'll try and broadcast the shipping forecast for long-wave listeners during the course of the Today programme.' The forecast, which provides reports on the seas around Britain, did eventually air at around 6.40am. The service is produced by the Met Office on . behalf of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and is crucial for fishermen and shipping companies. Broadcast four times a day - at 12.48am, 5.20am, 12.01pm and 5.54pm - it provides weather reports and updates on the state of the waters around Britain. A Radio 4 spokesman told MailOnline: 'Unfortunately our usual switch from BBC World Service, which is broadcast on Radio 4 overnight, didn't go as planned and was delayed by around 20 minutes. 'The Radio 4 announcer explained the situation on air to listeners and the Today programme pointed out that the Shipping Forecast was broadcast on Radio 4 LW at 6.40am. 'We apologise for the inconvenience.'","Trusted service failed to air at 5.20am as expected after a technical error .
Listeners took to Twitter to express their confusion over the mix-up .
One user tweeted: 'Isn't that the sign of impending nuclear Armageddon?'
Glitch meant the programme failed to broadcast for first time since 1924 ."
"A 14-year-old schoolboy has been told he can't fly his flag collection in his own back garden because of just one anonymous complaint. Liam Kenward, 14, has collected more than 200 flags in the past 10 years and enjoyed flying five at a time on two 20ft flagpoles in his secluded garden in Loose, Kent. But he has received a letter from the local council telling him he needs permission to fly more than two flags at a time - and can only have one flagpole a maximum of 10ft tall. The pupil at Valley Park School in Maidstone collected the national and nautical flags from  antiques fairs and rotated the selection every day. Liam Kenward, 14, has been told he can't fly his flag collection in his own back garden because of just one anonymous complaint, pictured with the green flag of Brazil . 'My flags are my passion and I'm really disappointed that I have to take them down,' he said. 'We've been living here for two years and I always thought everyone liked them. 'I'm really sad about taking them down as I bought so many and now can't even display them. 'I'm considering giving up the hobby because I can now only really put up one and it's not enough for how many I have.' The 14-year-old has been forced to take down two poles - one in the front garden and one in the back - along with three small flags mounted on top of the family's 9ft hedge. He has reduced the height of one of the poles and now only just flies above the hedge. His mum Tracey, 50, who owns her own gardening business, said Liam's hobby kept him on the 'right route'. He received a letter from the local council telling him he needs permission to fly more than two flags and the family put up a notice saying: 'This is very disappinting' He enjoyed flying five at a time on two 20ft flagpoles in his secluded garden in Loose, Kent, but he is only allowed one 10ft pole now . She said: 'He's so proud of the flags. He's completely gutted as it's his passion and he's been working on it for a decade now. 'What's sad is he isn't a malicious or badly behaved teenager vandalising anything. 'He's a smart boy who uses his passion to find out about the world and it's helped to keep him on the right route. 'We have never displayed any offensive flag and Liam is keen to put up flags of every nationality. 'He also puts up nautical flags and none of them are right in people's faces. 'He then teaches the school kids walking past about all the flags which is a really good thing and he knows the flags of practically every country now. 'They were only small flags and he's devastated to take them down. We don't understand why he can't display them if he wishes in his own garden. 'The person who complained could have just knocked on the door so we could discuss it with them, rather than complaining to the council.' He has collected more than 200 flags national and nautical flags in the past 10 years from antiques fairs . Liam would sometimes rotate the flags every hour if a big football game was on to represent the two countries playing. And on occasions when the Union flag is officially flown at half mast he would do the same. The family put up a notice to neighbours outside their house explaining they had been asked to remove the flags due to a complaint. It said: 'This is very disappointing to us, as we consider ourselves very approachable people, but more so for our son, as the flags are a huge passion of his.' One neighbour, a former police officer, has written to Maidstone Borough Council and their local MP supporting Liam. The family will now be applying for planning permission to fly five flags at once. A Maidstone Borough Council spokeswoman said: 'We investigated after receiving a complaint about the number of flags. 'Planning legislation in England allows two flags to be flown in the grounds of a building (subject to certain conditions) without planning permission, but if a resident would like to fly more flags at their property, they need to apply for planning permission.'","Liam Kenward, 14, has collected more than 200 flags in the past 10 years .

"Two of King John's teeth are due to go on display alongside surviving copies of the original Magna Carta at the British Library. The molars were extracted as souvenirs from King John's tomb at Worcester Cathedral in 1979 by William Wood, a stationer's apprentice. The teeth will now go on show alongside two of the original Magna Carta documents, as part of a new exhibition to celebrate parliamentary democracy. Two of King John's teeth (pictured left and right) are due to go on display alongside surviving copies of the Magna Carta as part of a new exhibition at the British Library . The molars were extracted as souvenirs from King John's tomb at Worcester Cathedral in 1979 by William Wood, a stationer's apprentice . King John signed the Magna Carta - which established the principle of the rule of law - at Runnymede, near Windsor, in June 1215. The moment is hailed as one of the most significant in English history. A thumb bone, also reportedly belonging to the medieval monarch, will also be on display. Curator Julian Harrison said: 'John's tomb at Worcester Cathedral was opened for a brief period in 1797, and certain of his body parts removed as souvenirs. 'On display in Magna Carta: Law, Liberty, Legacy will be two of King John's molars, taken from the tomb by William Wood, a stationer's apprentice, and kindly being loaned to our exhibition by Worcester City Art Gallery and Museum. 'On show with them will be a thumb bone, reputedly that of King John, which was returned to the cathedral in 1957. 'We're thrilled that we are going to have these items in our Magna Carta exhibition, and we're extremely grateful to the two institutions concerned for so kindly agreeing to lend them to us. ' King John (left) signed the Magna Carta at Runnymede, near Windsor, in June 1215 (right) – a moment hailed as one of the most significant in English history and the root of parliamentary democracy . It was signed to make peace with a group of rebel barons. It was reissued and reaffirmed on many occasions in subsequent years . The first Magna Carta was drafted by the Archbishop of Canterbury and agreed by King John on 15 June 1215 to make peace with a group of rebel barons. It was reissued and reaffirmed on many occasions in subsequent years. The four surviving copies of the original Magna Carta briefly went on show at the library as part of their 800th anniversary. More than 40,000 people entered a public ballot for the chance to see them, with 1,215 being selected to visit the display. The documents were at the library for three days before being taken to the House of Lords for another day. Two copies were then returned to the library, while the others went back to their homes at Lincoln and Salisbury cathedrals. The four original surviving copies were brought together earlier this month for the first time to celebrate the 800th anniversary of its signing. They were displayed at the British Library (pictured) The British Library's original copy of the Canterbury Magna Carta, which will be displayed beside the teeth . Speaking of the exhibition, the Lord Speaker, Baroness D'Souza, said: 'Magna Carta established the principle of the rule of law and equality before the law; for 800 years we have been influenced by its contents and it remains one of the most important political documents in the world, with countries such as the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada tracing constitutional influences back to Magna Carta.' The Speaker, Rt Hon John Bercow MP, said: 'Over the past eight centuries the public and their Parliament have shaped society and changed the way we live our lives. 'The sealing of the Magna Carta in 1215 and the Montfort parliament of 1265 marked the start of the journey towards modern rights and representation, paving the way for the House of Commons and democracy as we know it today.' Earlier this month, a forgotten Magna Carta manuscript which experts said could be worth up to £10million was discovered in a Victorian scrapbook in a Kentish town's archive. There are only 24 editions of the Magna Carta in known existence around the world. Pictured: A copy of one of the surviving copies at the British Library . The parchment, discovered in Sandwich's archive, was ripped and a third had been lost, but experts were able to establish it was issued by Edward I in 1300. Archivist Dr Mark Bateson discovered the historical document at the Kent County Council history and library centre in Maidstone. It is one of only 24 editions of the Magna Carta in known existence around the world. The new exhibition at the British Library will also include some items of clothing and part of a leather shoe found in the tomb and King John's will. Also on show are Thomas Jefferson's handwritten copy of the Declaration of Independence and one of the original copies of the US Bill of Rights. The exhibition is open from March 13 to September 1. Eight centuries after King John sent copies of the first Magna Carta across his kingdom, just four remain. Two of the survivors are kept at the British Library, were they lay alongside the other two copies which are usually found at Lincoln and Salisbury Cathedrals. The two British Library copies came from the private library of the MP and and antique collector Sir Robert Cotton, whose collection of preserved documents laid the foundation for the library back in 1753. One of these manuscripts was almost destroyed in a fire in 1731, suffering some damage but remaining largely intact. Staff at the British Museum Library in the early 19th century also made it harder to read by using outdated techniques to flatten and mount the historic document. The Salisbury Magna Carta has been at the Cathedral since the 13th century. It may have been deposited there by William Longespée, Earl of Salisbury and one of King John’s chief advisers, or it may have come from Elias of Dereham, who supervised the building of the Cathedral from the 1220s. The manuscript has rarely left the Cathedral in its 800 year history. The Lincoln Magna Carta has belonged to the Cathedral for 800 years. It is arriving at the British Library directly from the United States after going on display in Massachusetts and Washington, DC, where over 200,000 people viewed it. On its return to Lincoln, the manuscript will move from the Cathedral into a new permanent home at the ‘Magna Carta Vault’ in nearby Lincoln Castle.

"Harry Wentworth-Stanley is that type of male who has a peculiar effect on the opposite sex. Even the most reserved young ladies are provoked into throwing themselves at him. The fact that he does nothing to encourage such attention (he seems almost bemused by it) simply spurs on the girls even more. He is absurdly handsome, ridiculously tall (6 ft 4 in), a brilliant sportsman — dashing on the polo field and an accomplished off-piste skier — clever, charming and well-read. Scroll down for video . Harry Wentworth-Stanley (left) was seen holding hands with Cressida Bonas (right) on Valentine's evening this year, it isn’t clear whether Harry and Cressida are officially an item yet . His background, too, is impeccable. His mother, Clare, is the Marchioness of Milford Haven, having acquired the title upon her second marriage to Harry’s stepfather, the Marquess of Milford Haven. His father is Nick Wentworth-Stanley, a debonair Old Etonian. Indeed, if Harry weren’t such a nice chap, it might seem unfair that he has been bestowed with so many advantages in life. For the eminently eligible Harry Wentworth-Stanley is ‘the other Harry’ — the Harry who was photographed holding hands with Cressida Bonas, Prince Harry’s former girlfriend, on Valentine’s night. Cressida’s two-year romance with the Prince ended last April. Now, there is every indication she has moved on with another Harry. But all is not quite what it seems, for Cressida’s new man was actually on the romance scene first — and, as we will see, never really went away. Cressida, who turned 26 last week, had a serious relationship with Harry Wentworth-Stanley when they were both students at Leeds University. The couple were known to their crowd — for reasons that aren’t entirely clear — as ‘Water-Cress’. Friends say she was heartbroken when he took off for a gap year to Argentina in 2011 after graduating, and the romance petered out. Indeed, Cressida wasn’t quite over Harry when another Harry — Prince Harry himself — began pursuing her in the summer of 2012 and a romance began. There were concerts, rugby matches, skiing trips and cosy nights in at Kensington Palace. For a time, they were happy. If not forgotten, the other Harry was relegated to the back of her mind. But just months into her new relationship, Harry Wentworth-Stanley returned from Argentina. It seems he was keen to pick up with Cressida exactly where he had left off. According to a friend, he had been smitten by a girl in Buenos Aires, but it had come to nothing. Soon, there were reports Harry W-S was trying to win back Cressida while Prince Harry was on a tour of duty in Afghanistan. We don’t know whether that was correct or not, but the following summer, Cressida and Harry W-S were seen ‘flirting’ in a bar. Prince Harry and Cressida Bonas are seen here, before they split, leaving The Prince of Wales Theatre, London in October 2013 . Cracks soon began to appear in Cressida’s romance with the Prince. Cressida, who enjoys the limelight to a degree (she’s a fledgling actress, after all) was disturbed to find herself photographed by strangers on their phones in the street. But she was keen on the Prince and wanted a serious relationship with a degree of commitment. They split last April — the final straw for Cressida apparently being the Prince’s refusal to pay her £650 air fare to attend his friend Guy Pelly’s wedding in New York. In the meantime, it seems the other Harry was playing a waiting game. Their recent date suggests a rekindling of the romance. ‘Cressida was dotty about Harry at university and, when he went off to Argentina, she was heartbroken,’ says a friend. ‘Then the antidote came along in the form of Prince Harry. Now that’s all over, it’s not surprising that she and Harry W-S are gravitating towards one another again. ‘They’ve stayed close since the split, and he has always been a threat to Prince Harry.’ Harry (left) is seen here with his mother Clare Milford Haven (right) at the Jaeger-LeCoultre charity polo match and dinner at Coworth Park . It isn’t clear whether Harry and Cressida are officially an item yet, but appearances suggest they are. His admirers will be devastated. ‘Harry has girls swooning over him, but he is a level-headed young man and deals with it all with a grin and good grace,’ says the friend. ‘He has invitations pouring in night after night, but he avoids the limelight. He prefers weekends in country houses, riding, walking his dogs and swimming. Mr Wentworth-Stanley, 26, is not the idle trust-fund aristo of popular stereotype. He is training to become a surveyor with Savills and lives in a relatively modest flat in Notting Hill. On the surface, he appears to have led a charmed life and, for most of his childhood, that was so. He inherited his looks from his mother, Clare, a beauty who remains stunning at 54. There was a brother, James, four years his senior, and younger sister Louisa. When Harry was a child, his mother and father divorced. In 1997, Clare married George, Marquess of Milford Haven, a cousin of the Queen, himself divorced with two children. Cressida, pictured at the Golden Globes, 2015, is said to have had a serious relationship with Harry Wentworth-Stanley when they were both students at Leeds University . The family settled at Great Trippetts, an estate set in 1,000 acres in the Sussex Downs. For a time, life was perfect. Clare stayed on good terms with her former husband, Nick Wentworth-Stanley, who went on to marry Dutch beauty Millie Brenninkmeyer, with whom he had three more children. Shortly before Christmas 2006, the Marquess and Marchioness and their children went to stay with Nick and his wife in Worcestershire. James, Harry’s elder brother, was recovering from a relatively minor procedure. The operation was a success, but James had become very anxious in the days that followed. One evening, the family were gathered in the house when they heard a shot fired. They rushed outside to find James lying dead. The family was shattered by the tragedy. Harry (left) pictured with his father, Lord George Milford Haven (right), at Ladies Day at Glorious Goodwood in 2012 . Clare was floored by her son’s suicide. Touchingly, it was Harry, then 17, who helped her through it. She said in an interview 18 months after James’ death: ‘For the sake of the other children, you have to set an example. If you are strong, it gives them permission to be strong. If you fall to bits, they will. ‘The day after James died, his brother Harry said his biggest fear was that it would destroy me, and that would destroy everything else. It suddenly made me feel how important I was.’ Harry had to grow up quickly. ‘He was an absolute rock to his mother,’ says a friend. ‘After James died, he became much more grown-up.’ Prince Harry’s life, too, has been overshadowed by the tragic death of his mother, Diana, in the car crash in Paris in 1997. But the two Harrys appear to have coped with the hand they have been dealt in different ways. While Harry Wentworth-Stanley has become mature and grounded, Prince Harry, at times, can seem like a lost soul. Cressida, pictured in January this year, received favourable reviews for her appearance in the play There’s A Monster In The Lake, and was described as a ‘fantastic’ actress by movie mogul Harvey Weinstein . ‘He’s a bit of a Peter Pan in a way,’ says another source. ‘He can’t quite grow up. He wants happiness and security, but when there’s a possibility of finding it, he sabotages it.’ What he thinks of reports of Cressida’s Valentine’s date isn’t clear. According to one friend, however, he sent Cressida a text wishing her a happy birthday. ‘They are still friends — there wasn’t a dramatic falling out,’ says the source. According to the source, Cressida’s mother, four-times-married Lady Mary Gaye Curzon, was saddened when they split and had hoped there might be a reconciliation. Another of her daughters, Isabella Gough-Calthorpe, had a flirtation with Prince William when he split temporarily from Kate Middleton before their marriage. She went on to marry Sam Branson, Sir Richard Branson’s son. ‘There is a sense that one of her girls slipped through the net, and she was keen for it not to happen with Cressida,’ says the source. ‘She adored the fact Cressida was Prince Harry’s girlfriend.’ Whether Prince Harry will now be spurred into trying to win back Cressida remains to be seen. Since splitting from Prince Harry, Cressida’s profile has not dimmed. She received favourable reviews for her appearance in the play There’s A Monster In The Lake, and has a small part in forthcoming film Tulip Fever, which also stars Dame Judi Dench. Last month, movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, the film’s producer, described Cressida, as a ‘fantastic’ actress. Asked about her relationship with Mr Wentworth-Stanley, Cressida’s representatives said ‘no comment’. Harry’s mother, Lady Milford Haven, said she ‘didn’t get involved in that area of Harry’s life and couldn’t comment’. But it looks promising. ‘Harry was Cressida’s first real love and he has blossomed into a good-looking, fun-loving, but caring chap,’ says a friend. ‘He has all the right connections, without the royal blood and hang-ups.’ Both Harrys are undoubtedly a catch, but Mr Wentworth-Stanley looks like the best long-term bet. And if it doesn’t work out with Cressida, he can be consoled that there is a long queue behind her.","Harry Wentworth-Stanley is a brilliant polo player and off-piste skier .

"THE CAT’S OUT OF THE BAG: TRUTH AND LIES ABOUT CATS . by Max Cryer . (Exisle £9.95) Within his satirical lexicon The Devil’s Dictionary, the 19th-century American satirist Ambrose Bierce impertinently defined a cat as ‘a soft, indestructible automaton provided by nature to be kicked when things go wrong in the domestic circle’. This outrageous calumny, evidently the work of a dog-lover, appears in a new celebration of feline trivia and folklore gathered by Max Cryer. In his introduction, Cryer writes that it takes a while for cats to train humans to provide for their needs and not expect anything in return. Anyone who has ever become a willing slave to an exigent feline will know exactly what he means. The innate mysteriousness of cats has spawned a wealth of cultural references in language . But perhaps it isn’t quite fair to say that cats offer nothing in exchange for the food, warmth and adoration bestowed on them by their besotted owners. Dogs may claim the title of man’s best friend, but anyone who has lived with a cat knows they are simply too cool to want to be friends with humans. People who love cats find their aloofness captivating and their beauty irresistible. The most battle-scarred old moggy, prowling the garden wall in search of a fight, moves with the instinctive grace of a tiger. And it is no accident that cats, rather than any other creature, were considered sacred by the Ancient Egyptians. There is an enigmatic quality to the feline bearing that no dog could hope to emulate. The innate mysteriousness of cats has spawned a wealth of cultural references in language, literature, movies and even music. (If you have never heard Rossini’s Cat Duet, as sung by Felicity Lott and Ann Murray, check out the blissfully funny YouTube video of them performing it at the Proms.) True to their insinuating nature, cats turn up in the most unexpected of places. There are none in the Bible (though dogs, cattle, donkeys, lions, horses and chickens all feature in scripture). But Shakespeare’s works include 42 mentions of cats, and not all of them entirely complimentary. Among the most beloved of literary cats are the benevolently grinning Cheshire Cat from Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland; Mehitabel, the fictional alley cat whose adventures with her best friend, a cockroach called Archy, were the subject of a series of newspaper columns by the American journalist Don Marquis; and Tobermory, the devastatingly eloquent feline hero of a comic short story by the Edwardian writer Saki. Literary-minded cat-lovers cherish Edward Lear, whose boldly striped cat Foss appears in many of his illustrated nonsense rhymes, while Beatrix Potter’s books for children contain some vividly characterful cats, including the distracted single mother Tabitha Twitchit and her wayward son, Tom Kitten. In film, cats prove unexpectedly willing to take direction. Movies with feline stars include the Bond films, in which the villian, Blofeld, is often shown stroking his pet, a blue-eyed white Angora; Breakfast At Tiffany’s, in which a marmalade cat known only as Cat starred alongside Audrey Hepburn’s Holly Golightly; and the Coen brothers’ 2013 film Inside Llewyn Davis, in which a ginger tom stole the limelight from Justin Timberlake and Carey Mulligan. And when it comes to conflict, cats have proved themselves to be intrepid comrades. Wing Commander Guy Gibson VC, who led the Dam Busters raid, took his his cat, Windy, with him on so many flights that it gained more flying hours than many human pilots. Another wartime cat, Simon — an undernourished, dockyard kitten — was smuggled aboard HMS Amethyst in 1948 by 17-year-old Ordinary Seaman George Hickinbottom. Adored by the ship’s crew for his vigorous rat-catching and sense of humour (he used to leave dead rats in the sailors’ beds), he was given the rank of Able Seacat, and was wounded in action during the Yangtze Incident, when the ship was fired on by Chinese Communist gun batteries. Simon was awarded the Dickin Medal in August 1949 and died of an infection later that year. The entire crew of HMS Amethyst attended his funeral at the Ilford Animal Cemetery. Stories such as this bring tears to the eyes of soppy cat owners (of whom I am one). But before we get too sentimental, Cryer’s richly enjoyable anthology reminds us of the saying by that prolific coiner of aphorisms, Anon: ‘A cat knows your every thought, but doesn’t care.’","Max Cryer's new book is a celebration of feline trivia and folklore .

"The Bank of England (BoE) has suggested that they may consider rolling out their own digital currency at some point in the future. They highlighted the importance of digital currencies like Bitcoin, and say it could become as common as modern banknotes. But they warn that there are a number of problems - and if consumers flocked to digital currencies, it might leave high street lenders devoid of customers. The Bank of England has suggested it could 'mint' a digital currency. In a discussion paper it highlighted the benefits of currencies like Bitcoin (shown). It said this could eradicate the need for a third party - a bank. But a central bank would still be needed to regulate the currency . One of the benefits of using digital currencies is that a third party - such as a bank - is not necessarily needed to complete a transaction. This reduces some of the steps needed to securely transfer money - but the BoE notes that a means of controlling the digital currency would still be needed. Bitcoin is a distributed peer-to-peer digital currency that functions without any central authority, such as the Bank of England. The currency was launched in 2009 and is traded within a global network of computers. Bitcoins can be bought with near anonymity, which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy. But critics say that also makes Bitcoins a magnet for drug transactions, money-laundering and other illegal activities. However, a huge jump in value of Bitcoins in 2013 allowed some to reap huge rewards. For example a Bitcoin investor, Norwegian Kristoffer Koch, made more than half a million pounds in 2013 after he forgot he bought £17 ($26) of currency four years before. ‘The emergence of private digital currencies (such as Bitcoin) has shown that it is possible to transfer value securely without a trusted third party,’ said the Bank of England in a discussion paper. They added that while existing private digital currencies ‘have economic flaws which make them volatile,’ the process through which Bitcoins are ‘minted’ shows promise. This is known as the blockchain, where computers must work out the next line in a sequence of code with increasing difficulty to release more bitcoins. There is no process of actual minting, though - rather, the entire system relies on the steady progress of computers to ‘mine’ bitcoins and release them into the market. But a system would need to be devised that allowed a digital currency like this to be controlled. In a scenario where a digital currency is proposed by the BoE, the Bank would create its own digital currencies, and make them available just as they do with banknotes. The Bank of England highlighted the importance of digital currencies like Bitcoin, and said it could become as common as modern banknotes (stock image shown). But they warn that there are a number of problems - and if consumers flocked to digital currencies, it might leave high street lenders devoid of customers . ‘There are several different ways in which a central bank might make use of a digital currency,’ the BoE said. ‘It could be used as a new way of undertaking interbank settlement, or it could be made available to a wider range of banks and NBFIs [non-bank financial institutions]. ‘In principle, it might also be made available to non-financial firms and individuals generally, as banknotes are today.’ In a tweet the chancellor George Osborne said: ‘Good that @bankofengland looking into digital currencies - need to ensure UK customers benefit from new tech.’ The BoE notes there are a number of unanswered questions about digital currencies that need to be answered before it can be rolled out. These include the impact they would have on existing payment systems, and how regular bank would compete with digital currencies. The BoE warned that consumers may choose to hold all their money in electric money, rather than using high-street lenders, if it ultimately proved successful. And they have not yet put a timeline on when a Bitcoin clone could be introduced.","The Bank of England has suggested it could mint a digital currency .

"The Labrador Retriever has been revealed as the nation's favorite dog for the 24th consecutive year. The American Kennel Club, which released its annual  rankings on Thursday, praised the breed for being 'intelligent' and 'family friendly'. Despite its supremacy, bulldogs hit a new high at number four and their bat-eared cousins, French bulldogs, sauntered into the top ten for the first time in nearly a century. The AKC notes that bulldogs make 'excellent family companions with a natural tendency to form strong bonds with children, an easy-to-care-for coat, and minimal exercise requirements.' Scroll down for video . The Labrador Retriever has been revealed as the nation's favorite canine for the 24th consecutive year . Frenchies were number six in the decade of the 1910s, but their prevalence later waned. Then appearances in movies, TV shows and advertising raised their profile in recent years. Others to make the top ten were German shepherds, golden retrievers, beagles, Yorkshire terriers, poodles, boxers and Rottweilers. Dachshunds slipped from 10th to 11th place. The popularity of different dog breeds according to the American Kennel Club: . 1. Labrador Retriever . 2. German Shepherd Dog . 3. Golden Retriever . 4. Bulldog . 5. Beagle . 6. Yorkshire Terrier . 7. Poodle . 8. Boxer . 9. French Bulldog . 10. Rottweiler . Labrador retrievers hit the top ten in the 1970s and haven't left since. Originally bred to fetch game, Labs have proven able and willing to play virtually any canine role: search-and-rescue and police work, agility and other dog sports, guide and therapy dog work, and sensitive family companion. Breeder Micki Beerman recalls one of her Labs winning over a hesitant child by gradually moving closer, until the child began to pet the dog. 'They're just very intuitive,' said Beerman, of Brooklyn. 'They kind of know when you need them.' The AKC doesn't release raw numbers, only rankings. They reflect puppies and other newly registered dogs. Dog breeding draws criticism from animal-rights activists who feel it ends up fueling puppy mills, siphons attention from mixed-breed dogs that need homes and sometimes propagates unhealthy traits. The AKC says that its breed standards and recommended health testing help responsible people breed healthy dogs and that knowing breed characteristics helps owners choose a pet that's right for them.

"Not only has Fifty Shades of Grey brought BDSM to the mainstream, E.L. James' erotic novel and its film adaptation have inspired a bondage friendly dating app that is similar to Tinder - but kinkier. Whiplr is a free location-based messaging app that discretely allows users to channel their inner Christian Grey by connecting them with people who share similar interests in BDSM or other fetishes. 'The inspiration comes directly from the kink community where people are looking for ways to find and meet other like-minded people,” Whiplr Chief Commercial Officer Daniel Sevitt told the The Daily Dot in an email. Red room of pain: Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) gets tied up in this still from Fifty Shades of Grey . Modern dating: The new Whiplr app for iOS and Android phones was released today and allows users to connect with potential BDSM play partners who have similar fetishes and kinks . He added: 'I think the genius of Fifty Shades of Grey was that it tapped into something that was already happening.' According to the app's description, it is 'the world's first and only location-based messaging app to help you connect with potential play partners online or in person'. The free download, which was released today on iOS and Android, allows users to message, call and video chat their potential partners without ever having to leave the app's interface.

"After a entire month of awards ceremonies, the stars are clearly reaching the bottom of their red carpet wardrobes. At last night's Brit Awards, the celebrities fell foul of a whole host of fashion fails, including head-to-toe red lace, bright pink vinyl and ice skater-style dresses. And while many of the guests at the event at London's O2 such as Cara Delevingne added a rock edge to their wardrobe, others fell into the trap of overdressing. Scroll down for video . At the Brit Awards, the celebrities fell foul of a whole host of fashion fails. Some stars like Rebecca Ferguson (left) overdressed for the event, while others like FKA Twigs (centre) opted for bizarre costumes that didn't quite work, and Ashley Roberts (right) The BRITS are usually a safer event for singers, as they can dig into their smart-casual wardrobe to attend the ceremony, but clearly, stars like Rebecca Ferguson and Lianne La Havas didn't get the memo. The pair looked incredibly over-dressed in comparison to their musical counterparts, with Rebecca's outfit possibly being better at home at a gala dinner than one of the music industries coolest nights of the year. Elsewhere, popstrels like Charli XCX made the faux pas of displaying too much side-boob - the star left onlookers gasping with the acreage of chest on display as she took her turn on the red carpet. The clothes weren't the only area to take a hit, many of the guests also got a bit too enthusiastic with the curling tongs, like Ms Ferguson, once again, and Fleur East. And others simply did not dress up enough. Singer Jamelia was spotted wearing a white shirt with a black and white spotted skirt which would have been the perfect outfit had she been heading to the office. Read on to find out who made it on to FEMAIL's worst dressed BRITS list this year... Caroline Flack's shiny pink dress was like something out of a budget space age film and the skater shape of the frock did left us unexcited . Fleur East's dress was elegant, but her OTT curly Elvis do let her look down as the singer piled her hair on top of her head . Rebecca Ferguson's head of curls and floor-length red lace number was too much when put together . Charli XCX's dress left little to the imagination and had the added effect of appearing frumpy from the front . Lianne La Havas swamped her petite frame with too many layers covering her white dress in an over-sized kimono .

"Prince William is planning to start work as an air ambulance helicopter pilot in the summer after passing a 'rigorous' set of exams. The Duke of Cambridge hopes to work 'as close to full time as possible' flying both day and night shifts after completing  mandatory ground school training, which is expected to take a few months. He had been studying for his air transport pilot licence exams since last September and passed all 14 exams required to work as a civilian helicopter pilot, Kensington Palace revealed. Prince William is planning to start work as an air ambulance helicopter pilot in the summer after passing a 'rigorous' set of exams, pictured in a Sea King helicopter during a training exercise at Holyhead Mountain . The written exams covered a range of topics including the principles of flight, navigation, flight Planning and air law. The announcement was made shortly after the Duke of Cambridge touched down in Tokyo for a seven-day tour of Japan and China. Shortly after his current tour, he will undergo extra training with Bond Air Services before starting work for the East Anglian Air Ambulance service in the summer. This training will involve in-flight skill testing, simulated training and instrument rating, which involves flying in poor weather conditions. The Duke of Cambridge hopes to work 'as close to full time as possible' after completing mandatory ground school training, pictured disembarking  his RAF Search and Rescue Sea King Helicopter . Prince William will aim to work as close to full time as possible, covering shifts for the team based in Cambridge and Norwich and his salary will be donated to charity. As a result of his new job, the Duke's family are expected to spend more time at Anmer Hall on the Sandringham estate. The second-in-line to the throne has completed seven-and-a-half years of full-time military service. He began  his career with the Household Cavalry (Blues and Royals) and later served with The Royal Air Force, with his final posting as an RAF Search and Rescue Pilot. The royal left operational service in the Armed Forces in September 2013. A spokesman for Kensington Palace said: 'Shortly before departing for Japan and China, The Duke completed and passed his Air Transport Pilot's Licence exams, which he required before starting work as an Air Ambulance Pilot. 'After he returns from his tour to Japan and China in March, he will start working for East Anglian Air Ambulance and be formally employed by Bond Air Services. Shortly after his current tour, he will undergo extra training with Bond Air Services, pictured with Prince Charles at the RAF Rescue base . 'He will initially be required to complete another period of mandatory training, involving aircraft training, in-flight skills testing and further written exams.' He will spend the next week touring Japan and China, highlighting British links with both countries, and addressing issues such innovation, trade and creativity. The pitching for Britain had already started in Tokyo before he arrived with UK designers showing of their latest inventions at the British embassy. Miguel Head, William's private secretary, said ahead of the visit that the Duke was personally interested in the two countries which he has not visited before. He added: 'The Duke's hugely looking forward to the visit and getting to know two countries that will be important in his life for years to come.'","Prince William plans to  work as air ambulance helicopter pilot in summer .

"Scores of  BRITs viewers have complained about ITV's heavy muting of Kanye West's performance which they said distorted the track so much it sounded 'like Morse code'. Huge chunks of the song had no sound as producers muted offensive words and phrases during a 20 second delay as the live show was broadcast last night. The American rapper was joined by fire breathers and a host of other performers to debut his new track All Day at London's O2 Arena shortly after 9pm, the UK watershed. With the N word repeated throughout, ITV producers decided to mute sections viewers may have found offensive instead of bleeping the words. Scroll down for video . Scores of viewers complained after ITV muted  chunks of Kanye West's performance during the Brits last night, with some saying the track became so distorted it sounded 'like Morse code' The rapper was joined by a host of other musician to perform his new track All Day which was riddled with offensive language . The move ruined the star's performance, viewers said, with some questioning why it ever went ahead if so much of the song had to be censored. Others thought their TVs had broken when the sound was pulled without warning. ITV flashed an 'audio mute' sign in the corner of the screen, but many failed to notice it. Ofcom, the television watchdog, received 125 complaints from viewers after the performance. 'Ofcom has received 125 complaints regarding the Kanye West’s BRIT Awards performance on ITV. We are assessing these before deciding whether to investigate or not,' a spokesman said today. This morning no complaints had been made over ITV's editing of the performance. But Twitter users were quick to slam the channel's choice of censorship, with many saying it ruined the entire song. 'So much muted audio it sounded like Morse code,' said one Twitter user, while another asked: 'Why have him perform if they knew he was gonna (sic) swear?' Scores of viewers took to social media to complain about the channel's editing of the show, with many confused when the sound on their televisions suddenly cut out . Shocked: Lionel Ritchie and Taylor Swift were surprised by the rapper's language as they watched the live performance last night . West's reality TV star wife Kim Kardashian was seen dancing in the crowd next to Taylor Swift (above) shortly after the Shake It Off singer's shocked expression was caught on camera . ITV stood by its decision to mute the offending parts of the song this morning with the performance taking place only shortly after the 9pm watershed. 'ITV took the decision to use an audio mute during the performance. The Brits is broadcast live on ITV from 8pm to a wide audience,' a spokesman told MailOnline. 'We have operated a short time delay as standard practice for some years on the show, to allow us to mute language that may be inappropriate for that wide audience, and elected to do so in this case, given the performance took place shortly after the 9pm watershed.' Kanye West was introduced by wife Kim Kardashian-West who insisted on taking a selfie with hosts Ant and Dec before gushing about her husband. After his performance the reality TV queen took to her Twitter account to share her pride. 'Such a sick performance!!!' she wrote above a photograph of the rapper and his crew of back-up performers which some suggested had been inspired by the mobs of the London riots. But other celebrities were not as impressed, with Taylor Swift and Lionel Ritchie visibly shocked with the rapper's choice of language. Later viewers and the arena's audience were left stunned when Madonna fell down a stack of prop-stairs, landing on her back mid-performance. The singer was pulled backwards when a back-up dancer tugged on her costume cape, but recovered quickly to finish her rendition of Living for Love.

"If the idea of getting on a flight already fills you with dread, the latest breakthrough in aviation technology could turn fears into full-blown phobias. Researchers have successfully shown how a pilot can take off, fly, twist and turn, and land a drone using just his thoughts. The flight involved an electroencephalogram (EEG) cap and specially-designed software - and it could one day lead to passenger planes being controlled using only brainwaves. Scroll down for video . Researchers have successfully shown how brainwaves can be used to control and land a drone (right) in Portugal. During a public presentation in Lisbon, the team used a high-performance electroencephalogram (EEG) cap (left) to measure the brain waves of a ‘pilot’. An algorithm converted these  signals into commands . The brain-to-computer interface (BCI) software was developed as part of the Brainflight project. Brainflight is the work of four firms including Tekever, Champalimaud Foundation, Eagle Science and Technische Universität München. During a public presentation in Lisbon, Tekever and Champalimaud teams used a high-performance EEG cap to measure the brain waves of the ‘pilot’. A bespoke software and algorithm then converted these brain signals into drone commands. In December, a groundbreaking experiment gave a double amputee two mind controlled arms. Les Baugh, who lost both arms in an electrical accident 40 years ago, was able to operate the system by simply thinking about moving his limbs. After training his muscles to use the new arms, he was able to lift cups, and perform a range of motions with each arm, in a procedure experts say could change the way prosthetics are used. By thinking about which direction he wanted the drone to travel, the pilot was able to fly, turn and land the craft. ‘The drone operator, wearing a cap that measures brain activity, influences the drone’s path using nothing but simple thoughts,’ said Tekever. ‘Essentially, the electricity flowing through the pilot's brain acts as an input to the drone’s control system, in order to perform, on the air, a mission with objectives previously defined by the research team.' Brainflight combines aeronautical systems engineering with neuroscience research. The system has already been tested in a four seat, twin engine, propeller driven airplane simulator, and the next step is to use the technology in live flights. The researchers are hoping that BCI will be adopted in the future as a method of control for aircraft - both manned and remotely piloted. Brainflight combines aeronautical systems engineering with neuroscience research. The project's brain-to-computer interface (BCI) system has been tested in a four seat, twin engine, propeller driven airplane simulator (pictured) and the next step is to use the technology in live flights . The Brainflight work builds on previous brain-computer interface technology and software developed at the University of Minnesota (pictured). Researchers released a video showing students learning to steer a flying robot around a gym, making it turn, rise, dip, and even sail through a ring . ‘Through the BCI approach, we believe people will be able to pilot aircraft just like they perform everyday activities like walking or running,' continued the firm. ‘This will mean that pilots will be able to focus on higher cognitive activities while still being able to operate such a complex system as an aircraft.’ As a result, experts said pilots will reduce their workload, and disabled people may be able to become pilots. Beyond aviation, the project imagines the BCI technology being used in advanced prosthetics, and to control other complex systems such as cars, boats and trains. Similar technology was also recently shown off at the University of Texas at San Antonio. These researchers claim the technology could help make soldiers more mobile and remove the need for ground stations to send instructions to vehicles flying overhead . ‘The project has successfully demonstrated that the use of the brain computer interface (BMI) on a simulator for the Diamond DA42 aircraft, where one pilot controlled the simulator through the Brainflight system,’ said Tekever’s Ricardo Mendes. ‘We’ve also integrated the BMI with UAV ground systems and have successfully tested it in UAV simulators. We’re now taking it one step further, and performing live flight tests with the UAV.’ This work builds on previous brain-computer interface technology and software developed at the University of Minnesota.

"US internet firms have been warned by the British government they are not above the law after a damning report into the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby. Ministers have ordered web firms they must take a ‘zero tolerance’ approach to terrorist activity on their networks. It comes after the Intelligence and Security Committee found MI5 'would have been able to prevent' the brutal murder of Fusilier Rigby if Facebook had alerted authorities to online murder threats made by one of the killers. Michael Adebowale, left, and Michael Adebolajo, right, were jailed for life for the murder of Lee Rigby last year . It was found that Michael Adebowale 'expressed his intent to murder a soldier in the most graphic and emotive manner' five months before last year's attack - but the warning was not passed on to UK authorities. Fusilier Rigby, 25, was run over and then butchered by Adebowale and Adebolajo outside Woolwich barracks in south-east London in the first terror attack on British soil since the July 7 suicide bombings in 2005. In the most explosive section of the ISC report, published in November, it stated: 'Had MI5 had access to this exchange at the time, Adebowale would have become a top priority. There is then a significant possibility that MI5 would have been able to prevent the attack.' The report raised wider concerns that intelligence agencies faced ‘considerable difficulty’ in accessing the content of online communications from US-based firms including Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo. In the official government response, released today, ministers make clear that internet firms which operate in the UK must abide by UK law. Drummer Lee Rigby was almost decapitated in a brutal attack outside Woolwich barracks in May 2013 . US social media giant Facebook allegedly failed to close down Michael Adebowale's personal account - even after he used it to post explicit threats to kill a soldier. Today's report said: 'They left the one that said…“Let’s kill a soldier”. That didn’t meet their criteria [for closure].' While MPs and peers refused to name the company in question, it was later reported to be Facebook. The report criticised internet companies for their refusal to cooperate with security services to help stop terror attacks. It said it was 'clear' that social media companies could have 'made a difference' if they alerted British authorities to online messages in which Adebowale threatened to kill a soldier. The report says the company which hosted the terror exchange 'does not regard themselves as under any obligation to ensure that they identify such threats, or to report them to the authorities'. It added: 'We find this unacceptable: however unintentionally, they are providing a safe haven for terrorists. None of the major US companies the committee approached proactively monitor and review suspicious content on their systems, largely relying on users to notify them of offensive or suspicious content. None of them regard themselves as compelled to comply with UK warrants obtained under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. That means that even if MI5 had a warrant for the information before the attack, the company might not have responded. Ministers said: ‘The fact that a suspect is using a foreign, internet-based communications service as opposed to a UK-based equivalent should make no difference to our ability to access that suspect’s communications, if that company supplies a service to the UK.’ It warned of ‘obstacles’ which make it difficult for police and spies to obtain the data they need to ‘investigate and prevent terrorist acts’. Social media sites and other so-called Communications Services Providers have now been told to take ‘stronger, faster and further action to combat the use of their services by terrorists, criminals and their supporters, including through a zero tolerance approach to terrorist activity on their networks’. The government added: ‘They are committed to measures that make it easier for their users and the authorities to report terrorist and extremist propaganda. ‘We will build on this to encourage companies to work together to produce industry standards for the identification, removal and referral of terrorist activity.’ In November's report, the ISC criticised the security services for 'delays' in their investigations which at times was 'inadequate.' It conceded that given what the agencies knew at the time 'they were not in a position to prevent the murder of Fusilier Rigby'. However it slammed giant internet firms for failing to hand over key pieces of information which might have helped security chiefs stop the attacks. It says Adebowale's detailed threat to kill a soldier, posted online in December 2012, was 'highly significant'. In the most explosive section of the report, it states: 'Had MI5 had access to this exchange at the time, Adebowale would have become a top priority. There is then a significant possibility that MI5 would have been able to prevent the attack.' The main findings of the report included: . When the report was released Facebook released a statement insisting it did not allow extremists to plan attacks on its site. A spokesman said: ‘Like everyone else, we were horrified by the vicious murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby. ‘We don’t comment on individual cases but Facebook’s policies are clear, we do not allow terrorist content on the site and take steps to prevent people from using our service for these purposes.’ Adebolajo and Adebowale ran down Fusilier Rigby, who was dressed in a Help for Heroes hoodie, in a Vauxhall Tigra near Woolwich Barracks, in south-east London, before savagely attacking the defenceless soldier as he lay in the road. As armed police arrived, the two men charged the vehicle, with Adebowale brandishing a rusted, unloaded revolver. They were both shot at the scene. The killers were convicted of murder at the Old Bailey in December last year and were later sentenced to whole life and life with a minimum of 45 years respectively. The ISC report confirms both men were known to MI5 – especially Adebolajo, 29, who was arrested in Kenya in 2010 attempting to cross the border into Somalia to fight for the African terror group Al Shabaab. He was passed to British spies. Michael Adebowale was encouraged to murder a British soldier by an online accomplice referred to only as ‘Foxtrot’ in today’s report. Foxtrot was not known to MI5 at the time of the killing, but it now thought to be an extremist with links to Al Qaeda. In December 2012 Adebowale revealed to Foxtrot his desire to murder a soldier ‘in the most graphic and emotive manner’ because of UK military action in Iraq and Afghanistan. Adebowale had not, at that point, five months before the attack, developed a definite plan as to how he might carry out such an attack. Foxtrot ‘encouraged him and suggested several potential attack methodologies’, the report reveals. These ranged from ‘a martyrdom operation to use of a knife’. ‘Adebowale believed that security arrangements that guarded soldiers’ places of work might make it difficult to carry out an attack, and that alternative, less secure locations should be considered. ‘Foxtrot wanted to be kept informed of Adebowale’s ideas. However, no evidence of further contact between them has been found.’ The exchange only came to light on June 6, 2013, when a US internet company handed over the information. It cannot be published on national security grounds.","Fusilier Rigby was murdered by  Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale .

"Police have seized more than 100 kilograms of methamphetamines, with an estimated street value of $65 million, which were hidden in a kids toy container. The massive haul was a joint operation between the Australian Federal Police and Australian Customs and Border Protection Service and the drugs were found in a huge container from China. During the examination of the container, officers located a false floor which concealed a hidden compartment. Police have seized more than 100 kilograms of methamphetamines, with an estimated street value of $65 million, which were hidden in a kids toy container . The compartment contained 100 kilograms of a white crystallised substance, which when tested indicated a positive reaction to methamphetamine. On Wednesday, customs officers and Australian Federal Police accompanied the crate on a delivery to Prestons in southwestern Sydney, where they arrested a 30-year-old Hong Kong man and 37-year-old Malaysian man in a carpark. The men have been charged with serious drug offences for their involvement in the importation. AFP Acting Manager Serious and Organised Crime Arthur Moerman said the operation is an example of Australian law enforcement agencies cooperating effectively to target illicit drug importations. During the examination of the container, officers located a false floor in the container which concealed a hidden compartment . 'Those that seek to import dangerous drugs such as methamphetamine will continue to face the combined efforts of Australian law enforcement partners,' Acting Commander Moerman said. ACBPS Regional Commander NSW, Tim Fitzgerald, emphasised the importance of the seizure for community safety. 'Australia's law enforcement agencies are working together to protect the Australian community from harmful substances. The seizure and resulting arrests prevented the production and distribution of a significant quantity of methamphetamines,' Mr Fitzgerald said. 'This was a complex concealment clearly designed to evade law enforcement detection, however our expert x-ray image analysis and enforcement officers have once again proven that crime doesn't pay.' Investigations are ongoing and the AFP has not ruled out further arrests.

"They have been firm favourites with children for generations. But according to a new survey, the epic tales of JRR Tolkien have fallen out of favour with today’s youngsters, who are instead opting for authors like David Walliams. The poll of 508,000 pupils found Walliams’ The Demon Dentist is now the most popular book for under 12s, while John Green’s The Fault in Our Stars is the favourite for teenagers. After being a firm favourite with children for decades, a new survey has revealed that the epic tales of JRR Tolkien (right) have fallen out of favour with today’s youngsters to be replaced by the books of comedian David Walliams (left) JK Rowling’s Harry Potter tales also feature heavily in the top 20 charts, as do Suzanne Collins’ Hunger Games books and novels by Cassandra Clare, who penned The Mortal Instruments series. The annual What Kids Are Reading survey found that while old classics like Roald Dahl’s The Twits were still read at school, children were not necessarily enjoying them the most. And for the first time since the charts began, JRR Tolkien’s novels including Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit have dropped out of the top 20 most popular. The survey is based on an analysis of software that assesses the books children read and their understanding of those stories. Pupils in 2,257 schools took more than nine million quizzes giving details of the books they had read and their favourites. The results showed that the ‘most read’ charts at both primary and secondary level were dominated by Jeff Kinney’s Wimpy Kid books and Roald Dahl. The poll of 508,000 pupils found Walliams’ The Demon Dentist (right) is now the most popular book for under 12s, replacing Tolkien's Lord of the Rings (centre) while John Green’s The Fault in Our Stars is now the favourite book for teenagers (left) The ‘most read’ chart indicates the amount of times a book was read in school, while the ‘popular’ ranking indicates the books that children enjoyed the most. The findings also showed that in the first three years of school, students steadily read more books each year, peaking at 32.1 books aged 8, but after this, the number declined. The report said: ‘This would to some extent be expected as older students read longer and harder books.’ But it went on to suggest that while primary school pupils favoured challenging books, by the time youngsters went to secondary school they tended to prefer easier novels. Report author Professor Keith Topping said: ‘This year’s findings reveal a sharp contrast in the difficulty rating between primary and secondary pupils. ‘Primary school pupils, particularly in Years 1 to 5, show a strong preference for challenging books which are significantly beyond their natural reading age. ‘We then see a marked difference in Year 7 where favoured books are no longer above chronological age, but six months below it and in ensuing years the difficulty of books plateaus or declines.’ Most popular books .

"An obese woman who would scoff half a ton of potatoes every year has lost almost half her body weight after ditching her favourite spud snacks. Trisha Corbett, 26, from Limerick, Ireland, tipped the scales at 26st 11lbs, eating her way through chips, roasties, mash or a jacket potato oozing with butter. The trainee teacher's addiction spiralled out of control, and Trish ballooned to a size 30 before realising that she needed to lose weight. Trisha Corbett piled on the pounds after constantly snacking on potatoes but has lost almost half of her body weight since ditching her favourite spuds . The turning point for Trisha came in October 2011, when she began to suffer from terrifying heart palpitations that left her dizzy and gasping for breath. She swapped the spuds for a healthy, varied diet, and by doing so, she lost an incredible 13st 4lbs - shrinking down to a size 14. She joined her local Weight Watchers group and would dine on fresh fruit and vegetables. In her first week alone, she lost a massive 10lbs. Within 18 months, she had lost 5st. Trisha, from Newcastle West, had struggled with her size from a young age, saying that things got worse after she began to graze on potatoes. At her heaviest Trisha was almost 27st and her BMI was 57 more than double what it should have been . Trisha says she had struggled with her weight from a young age and her parents would struggle to find clothes to fit. Pictured: Trisha age four (right) with her sister Mairead . 'I'd always been overweight, and as a child my parents struggled to find clothes to fit me,' she said. 'Over the years, I just got bigger and bigger. And my love of potatoes definitely didn't help. 'Whilst most people get cravings for chocolate or crisps, I couldn't wait to tuck into a spud! 'My favourite was a jacket potato with loads of butter - even thinking about one made my mouth water.' Trisha's potato addiction meant her weight had spiralled out of control by 2011. At 5ft 8in and almost 27st, her body mass index was a shocking 57 - more than double the recommended range of 18.5 to 25. As well as her weight being bad for her health Trisha was also the victim of cruel taunts from strangers, who said that she was 'as wide as a bus' and was 'blocking the street'. Before her weight loss (left) Trisha would gorge on potatoes eating three large jackets as a snack but since losing the weight (right) she says that she doesn't miss spuds at all . Trisha was shunned by men on nights out with friends and had to watch friends settle down with boyfriends while she remained single. Pictured: Trisha (right) with friend Emma Falahee . BREAKFAST: Coco Pops and a sausage roll . LUNCH: Chicken wrap, chips and a Coke . DINNER: Mince and roast potatoes . SNACKS: Chocolate, pastry, jacket potatoes . BREAKFAST: Fruit and porridge . LUNCH: Chicken salad . DINNER: Chicken and vegetables . SNACKS: Fruit, yoghurt . Trisha said  although their comments were extremely hurtful, she admits that they probably had a point. 'It was completely humiliating. Absolute strangers would shout that I had four stomachs, or point at my spare tyre,' she said. 'While it was upsetting and incredibly rude, I couldn't deny that what they were saying was true.' As she continued to gain weight Trisha says she even began to resemble her favourite food. 'My belly was always the most obvious thing about my size. Instead of growing out, it grew down in a big lump. I'd even started to look like a potato!' The trainee teacher says that the turning point came after she began to suffer from heart palpitations . As well as her health suffering, Trisha's weight meant she was often a victim of abuse from strangers . Trisha now works out regularly and says she has developed a talent for weight lifting . Shunned by men on nights out, Trisha had to watch as all of her friends began to get boyfriends and settle down. Her weight also led to embarrassing social situations with Trisha recalling one occassion when car shopping left her red faced. 'When I bought my first car, a little Ford Fiesta, I could barely fit in it. I had to push the seat right back so I could reach the steering wheel. 'I also had to ask for seat extensions on the plane - which was horrible. I felt like everyone was turning around to look at me.' Speaking about suffering palpitations and dizzy spells, she added: 'It was really scary. Sometimes I'd have to sit with my head between my legs until the palpitations had stopped. 'My massive size was stretching my body to breaking point. It was then that I finally realised what I was doing to myself. 'Over the years, I'd tried pushing my weight problems to one side, but I knew I couldn't do this any longer - it could end up killing me.' After leaving Weight Watchers in April 2013, Trisha began to work out with a personal trainer five times a week. Lifting weights and going for long walks ensured that she lost a further 8st 6lbs by September 2014 - taking her total weight loss to an incredible 13st 4lbs. Now weighing in at 13st 7lbs, Trisha has dropped an amazing eight dress sizes and wears a size 14. To maintain her slim figure, Trisha eats a balanced diet that includes plenty of chicken, fruit and vegetables - with potatoes no longer on the menu. She also goes to the gym up to six times a week for a gruelling two-hour workout which she says has completely altered her life. 'I'm in the best shape of my life. I've even discovered that I have a talent for lifting weights. 'It's incredible how I've gone from having to hold my head between my legs to stop me from being dizzy to spending up to 12 hours a week working out at the gym.' With potatoes now banished from her cupboards, Trisha says she is looking forward to a healthy, happy future. And although Trisha occasionally lets herself  dip into her old snack of choice she says she no longer pines for potatoes. 'I do treat myself to a couple of chips every now and again, but surprisingly I don't actually miss potatoes. 'I'm so much happier now. I'll never go back to being a 27st spud.'","Trisha Corbett piled on weight eating three jacket potatoes a day .

"TV shows, movies and books are full of suggestions of where to hide out from a zombie apocalypse, but researchers at Cornell claim to have found the safest place. Rick and his band of refugees from Atlanta in 'The Walking Dead' tried a remote farmhouse and a prison; 'Dawn of the Dead' had survivors holed up in a shopping mall; and 'Shaun of the Dead' proposed the local pub. It's fair to say that most of these hideouts did not work out that well for those involved. Researchers from Cornell University have now discovered that the correct thing to do should the dead start to walk the earth is to literally head for the hills. Scroll down for videos . Characters on 'The Walking Dead' have tried several different hide outs from the zombie apocalypse, including a remote farm and a prison, but researchers at Cornell think they have found the ideal place to go . Hollywood has had American survivors taking refuges in a shopping mall in 'Dawn of the Dead' (left), while Brits choose to head to their local pub in 'Shaun of the Dead' (right) Alexander Alemi, Matthew Bierbaum, Christopher Myers and James Sethna used an approach for modelling disease to work out how an actual outbreak might play out. They found that cities would fall quickly, but it would take weeks for zombies to penetrate into less densely populated areas, and months to reach northern parts of the mountain-time zone. Their advice is to head for the Rockies. The research involved results from simulations the researchers wrote themselves, similar to modelling chemical reactions. 'Modeling zombies takes you through a lot of the techniques used to model real diseases, albeit in a fun context,' Alemi told phys.org. There are four states a person can be in (human, infected, zombie, dead zombie), and these are dependent on possible interactions (zombie bites human, human kills zombie, zombie moves etc). 'Given the dynamics of the disease, once the zombies invade more sparsely populated areas, the whole outbreak slows down - there are fewer humans to bite, so you start creating zombies at a slower rate,' says Alemi. 'Modeling zombies takes you through a lot of the techniques used to model real diseases, albeit in a fun context,' said researcher Alexander Alemi . The research team were inspired by a graduate statistical mechanics class and by reading 'World War Z' by Max Brooks. The CDC uses a zombie apocalypse as a learning tool to teach emergency preparedness . 'I'd love to see a fictional account where most of New York City falls in a day, but upstate New York has a month or so to prepare.' The researchers aim to add more complicated social variables to their simulation such as awareness of the outbreak and ability to make a run for it. The group were inspired by graduate statistical mechanics class and by reading 'World War Z: an oral history of the first zombie war' by Max Brooks. Indeed the conclusions of their research match up with some of the plot points of the book, which sees the U.S. abandon two-thirds of the country and retreat behind the Rockies to regroup before launching a counterattack. They found that cities would fall quickly as large numbers people that would be quickly infected as in the movie 'World War Z', but it would take weeks for zombies to get to less densely populated areas like the Rockies . The Cornell team are less optimistic about our prospects. The abstract for their research ends with the line: 'We build up to a full scale simulation of an outbreak in the United States, and discover that for ""realistic"" parameters, we are largely doomed.' Despite this, since 2011 the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has playfully used a zombie apocalypse as a learning tool for teaching emergency preparedness. The group presents its findings during the 2015 American Physical Society March Meeting, on Thursday, March 5 in San Antonio, Texas.","Researchers from Cornell University created a simulation of a zombie outbreak using techniques for modelling real diseases .

"A  couple who skipped out on their bill at a restaurant have returned to pay for their expensive three-course meal after being shamed in a social media campaign. Owners of Mojos restaurant in Bunbury, Western Australia, Juliana Frisina and Noel Brunning took to Facebook to share a CCTV image in a bid to track down the 'dine and dash' pair who walked out without paying a $230 bill on Saturday night. The French couple allegedly ordered and ate an extravagant  meal and wine, told the waiters they were going for a cigarette and left a wallet on the table for assurance while they stepped outside. But the diners never returned and when the waitress picked up the wallet she found the words ‘bad mother***er’ from the 1994 movie Pulp Fiction ironically embossed on its underside. Scroll down for video . The French couple who walked out without paying an expensive three-course meal have returned to settle bill . Mojos restaurant posted an online search warrant for this couple after allegedly walking out without paying . The pair, who worked at a nearby farm in Manjimup on a working holiday visa, returned to the restaurant on Thursday to apologise and pay for their bill. After grabbing national headlines, the restaurant revealed not only were the duo  slapped with embarrassment but they were both sacked at their farming jobs shortly after the incident. But the owners of Mojos said they decided not to charge the couple. 'We have been working hard today to get our ""Dine & Dash "" couple to come & pay their bill , when we discovered their whereabouts in Manjimup,' the Facebook post read on Thursday. 'We didn't want them charged we felt they had, had enough justice as the Farmer who employed them, promptly sacked them & told them to rectify the situation. Which they have now done with some embarrassment. 'We are very proud to be part of such a great chase around Australia. Which ultimately lead to all of Australia ""Dishing "" out justice, & we the small business owner getting a small win all because of everyone's support. The restaurant revealed the pair were sacked from their farming jobs but the owners don't want them charged . The bill settlement follows after the establishment's owners posted a search warrant for the pair on social media on Sunday, which quickly went viral. ‘WANTED YOUNG FRENCH COUPLE. Could the young French couple who skipped paying their bill last night come back today & rectify the situation,’ the Facebook post read on Sunday. ‘You have very identifiable tattoos & nose rings & work in a nearby farm. Man was heavily tattooed & the female had septum piecing in her nose. ‘We will get the footage off the security cameras & take to the Police tomorrow if you haven't settled your account by tonight ,’ they warned. Owners of Mojos restaurant Juliana Frisina and Noel Brunning (pictured) posted on Facebook after the incident . Mojos status warned the couple that they have 'very identifiable tattoos and nose rings' After recieving an 'overwhelming' response from the local community they thanked everyone for their help . The post was shared thousands of times and has now been seen by almost 30,000 people after the couple failed to return so the owners also posted a grainy CCTV image of the pair on Facebook. The image showed a man wearing a purple t-shirt and blue shirt, while a blonde woman was dressed in a black strappy top. ‘Wanted. This French Couple who skipped their substantial bill on Saturday 21st Feb at Mojo's. Anyone seen them, call Mojo's or CrimeStoppers. 1800333000,’ the update read. Co-owner Ms Frisina told Daily Mail Australia: ‘They had a lovely time with their food and drink. 'It was a substantial amount for a couple.’ The French couple reportedly ordered a 'substantial' three-course meal from Mojos . 'It's the one that says bad motherf*****': The wallet the couple left on the table was reminiscent of the one Samuel L. Jackson owns in Pulp Fiction . The diners came for a three-course-meal at Mojos where the owners say 'most people are pretty honest' She said she never expected the post to go viral, usually the restaurant’s Facebook updates only receive a few hundred ‘likes’. ‘We didn’t expect it to go out like it did, it quickly surpassed 10,000 views and is now up past 30,000. ‘We were just astounded at the community support, the way people jumped to support,’ Ms Frisina said. ‘This couple were intent on leaving. They left a couple of times for smokes out the front and then made a big show about leaving the wallet on the table, which turned out to be empty. ‘We don’t know who they are we only know they are French because they were conversing with our French waitress, they told her they were working in a farm,’ Ms Frisina explained. Mr Brunning and Ms Frisina reported the incident to local police. ‘Most people are pretty good and usually it’s a genuine mistake when someone runs away from a cup of coffee… most people are pretty honest,’ Ms Frisina said.","A couple who walked out of a restaurant have returned to settle the bill .

"Activist Richard Crouch (right) with Ukip's deputy leader Paul Nuttall . Ukip tonight announced it had launched an investigation into claims a former candidate sent a series of racist messages on Facebook. Activist Richard Crouch allegedly claimed his home town on Leicester was a 'sh*thole… full of P***s'. Messages which appeared on his Facebook account also referred to Asians in Leicester as 'The Taliban' and Romanians as 'pick pocketing criminals'. Mr Crouch told MailOnline his Facebook page had been hacked and he would never have sent the messages, which were posted on his account between March and December 2013. He said: 'I never said it. I'm absolutely disgusted with it – it's malicious communication.' Mr Crouch said he had made an official complaint to Leicestershire Police about the messages posted on his site. 'I've deleted my Facebook account on their advice. It is all totally concocted,' he said. Mr Crouch added: 'I must've upset someone, but I don't know why – I don't know what I've done to deserve this. I'm just an activist – I'm not a candidate.' Ukip tonight said allegations Mr Crouch had posted racially abusive material were being investigated. He said: 'His comments will be investigated and considered at the earliest opportunity by the National Executive Committee.' A spokesman added: 'We need to be fair to him – he categorically denies that he is responsible for these messages. He denies it has anything to do with him, but we've got to investigate it and that is what we are doing.' He added that Mr Crouch was a Parish Council candidate, not a Parliamentary candidate. Leicestershire Police were tonight unable to confirm or deny if Mr Crouch had contacted them about the messages on his Facebook page. A message was posted on Ukip activist Richard Crouch's Facebook page referring to Leicester as a 's*** hole' which was 'full of p***s'. Mr Crouch denies writing the message . Ukip leader Nigel Farage is set to address a Conservative conference in the US tonight before flying back to give his speech to the party's spring conference in Margate . The controversy comes after the chair of Ukip's gay and lesbian group stepped down and resigned his party membership, saying he can no longer 'defend the party or convincingly campaign for it.' Tom Booker, who founded the LGBTQ in Ukip group three years ago, announced he was standing down on Twitter last night, saying he wasn't able to support the party's manifesto. He said: 'Last night I stepped down as Chairman of LGBT in UKIP and gave up my membership of #ukip. I'll remain unaffiliated…for now ;-)' In a series of replies to questions on Twitter, he explained that he 'couldn't defend the party or convincingly campaign for it any more.' He also said the party was 'a long way from classical liberal these days.'

"A female Olympic gold medalist has used her phenomenal strength to restrain four speeding motorbikes - each pulling with 1,050lbs of force in opposite directions – with her arms, as a part of her most recent extreme stunt. Juli Moody, a 37-year-old from California, has earned herself the nickname 'The Female Human Link' because of her extraordinary ability to stall moving motorcycles by pulling the vehicles' attached restraints with her crossed arms. And the former Olympic Power Lifting medal winner, who first hit the headlines after holding back two screaming Harley Davidsons in a haze of tire smoke and burning rubber, has now taken her daring trick up a notch by adding two more motorcycles to the original equation.

"Jodie Plume (pictured) has suffered from a sleep disorder all her life, it causes her to hallucinate during the night, believing that her dreams are real . Jodie Plume stood at the end of her bed in the darkness, trembling from head to toe with terror. The scene before her was surreal — yet she didn’t question it for one second. There, looming in the shadows, like something out of a horror movie, swung a large bubbling vat of acid, poised precariously over the bed and its sleepy occupant, her partner Josh. It seemed clear he was about to be scarred for life. ‘Josh, Josh!’ she screamed, pulling at the bed sheets. ‘Wake up! They’re going to pour acid on you! Get up now!’ But Josh didn’t flinch. Instead, he slowly got out of bed, sighed deeply, and led Jodie gently back to her pillow. ‘There’s no acid,’ he murmured. ‘Go back to sleep. I’ve got to get up in an hour.’ Josh was all too aware the vat of acid didn’t exist because, on a nightly basis, he’s woken by Jodie’s terrifying hallucinations that can include burglars, objects floating around the room and even spirits. She suffers from a rare form of parasomnia — or sleep behaviour disorder — which occurs halfway between sleep and wakefulness, in what’s known as the ‘hypnagogic state’. When Jodie gets out of bed at night, she is not acting out her nightmares, since technically she is not fully asleep. Instead, she is hallucinating — and she feels the adrenalin rush of very real fear. Released from the usual muscular atonia, or weakness, of sleep, Jodie can walk around, talk, gesture and scream. She is not fully conscious, but instead reacting to a dream-like world, conjured from the depths of her half-asleep brain. But it’s no laughing matter: the true awfulness of the condition lies in the regularity with which it happens. For Jodie, who’s 30 and a doctor’s receptionist from Thurmaston, Leicester, these scenes occur every night — and sometimes up to six times an evening. Each episode lasts several minutes, and occasionally poses a real danger to her and her long-suffering partner. ‘One night, I woke up to find Josh pulling something out of my mouth,’ she says. ‘He’d turned the lights on and looked absolutely terrified. He told me I’d woken him up and informed him in hushed, appalled tones that there were robbers in the house who wanted to steal my jewellery. I’d then grabbed all my rings and stuffed them in my mouth. Josh had to fish them out to stop me choking. I’ve never seen him so frightened.’ Jodie is with her partner, Josh Adcock (right). Jodie's condition can be incredibly dangerous, she attempted to swallow her rings one night and was saved from choking when Josh realised what she'd done . Other forms of parasomnia include sleep-eating; sleep sex, in which sexual acts are carried out by a person who’s asleep; and somniloquy, when someone talks aloud while sleeping, even making long speeches. Some disorders, like Jodie’s hallucinatory somnambulism (sleepwalking), are associated with partial waking up — and many are thought to have a genetic component to them. Indeed, Jodie’s mother and aunt suffer from the condition, too. Jodie was four when she first remembers it happening. ‘I had tonsillitis and a fever. I woke up and saw yogurt pots and spoons marching around my bedroom,’ she says. ‘I screamed out to my mother and she soothed me back to sleep. She told me it was just a bad dream.’ All children suffer nightmares, of course, and some experience night terrors with a sleepwalking element to them, particularly when they’re feverish. But Jodie’s parasomniac episodes didn’t stop there. They increased in frequency and intensity, until, by the time she reached her 20s, she was suffering night-time hallucinations many times each night. If it happened when she was alone, she would barely remember it the next day. But when friends came to stay, they were in for an eerie shock. ‘I once had some girlfriends over, and got up in the night believing they were trapped in nets or plastic bags,’ she says. ‘I ran over to them, screaming, trying to “free” them from suffocation.’ Jodie took to warning boyfriends of her ‘dark side’. ‘At night, I’d see all sorts of things — burglars, people standing in the room, floating objects, police coming to arrest us. Some boyfriends would be understanding. Some not so much.’ By the age of 24, she was at her wits’ end, and at last went to her GP, who prescribed sleeping pills. ‘I tried one brand and it did diminish the hallucinations a little,’ she says. ‘But I’d wake up so groggy and exhausted, it was counter-productive. I was as tired as if I’d been up six times as usual.’ Over the years, Jodie has tried various pills but none stopped the disorder completely. Often she’d be so exhausted she couldn’t focus at work. In her late 20s, she was referred to a sleep clinic, but to her disappointment, found no answers there either. Jodie (pictured aged 2) remembers her first experience of the condition aged four . ‘I hoped they’d analyse my sleep patterns but they didn’t,’ she says. ‘The consultant simply told me I would “grow out of it”, which I found strange as I was already an adult.’ Children do grow out of some disorders associated with the hypnagogic state. The form of sensory distortion known as Alice In Wonderland Syndrome, for example — where people feel as though parts of their body shrink or grow — is thought to affect far more children than adults. Yet other parasomnias affect those of any age. Some are associated with anti-depressants, or with neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, stroke, or narcolepsy, where the brain’s ability to regulate a normal sleep-wake cycle is seriously compromised. It’s believed that up to 10 per cent of the population suffer a sleep disorder at some stage of their lives. It is thought that Jodie’s (pictured aged 12) hallucinatory somnambulism could be genetic, both her mother and aunt suffer from the same condition . A year ago, Jodie began dating Josh, who’s also 30 and an engineer. It was love at first sight, she says — yet her excitement was tinged with anxiety. ‘I know it sounds a cliche,’ she says, ‘but I knew he was “the one” almost immediately — and that terrified me. ‘There was a cloud hanging over me: my night-time episodes. What if my sleep disorder ruined everything and scared him away? I was so afraid of it that I put off spending the night with him.’ Before they did, she resolved to sit Josh down and tell him just how freaky her night-time behaviour could get. ‘I told him I suffered from a sleep disorder and that it could make me do all sorts of strange things,’ she says. ‘But he just smiled and said I wouldn’t get “night terrors” with him there. I hoped he was right.’ Before Jodie and Josh spend the night together for the first tine, Jodie sat him down to explain her sleep disorder as she was so afraid that it would put him off . Remarkably, for a while, he was. For a few days Jodie didn’t suffer any hallucinations at all. ‘Josh even joked that he’d cured me,’ she says. ‘I almost dared to believe him.’ The lull didn’t last, and over the next few weeks, Josh witnessed everything: ‘Me screaming that I was naked in a see-through bed. Grabbing his face in the dark to check it was him and not an intruder. Telling him things were falling from the ceiling; screaming that someone was about to pour acid on him. All of it.’ A shift-worker who sometimes has to get up at 5am, poor Josh spends much of his day exhausted. ‘But he’s so supportive,’ says Jodie. ‘He just holds me and tries to calm me down until it passes. He’s used to it by now, and he won’t let me sleep in the spare room. Some nights he finds me dusting off his face and body because I can see ants crawling all over him. He just rolls over and goes back to sleep.’ Jodie and Josh are thrilled to be expecting their first baby together, but Jodie is concerned that the child may inherit her condition . Jodie and Josh have since taken precautions, such as removing all sharp objects, including nail scissors and files, from the bedroom and ensuring the windows are closed. They’ve also removed mirrors, since reflections of light seem to trigger Jodie’s episodes. Together, they even came up with a comic name for the ‘other’ Jodie that emerges each night — TEJ: The Evil Jodie. Thankfully, TEJ isn’t always in evidence — and now Jodie and Josh are expecting their first baby. ‘I’m thrilled we’re about to start a family but I’m also frightened about how I’ll cope with the baby and my sleep disorder,’ says Jodie. ‘Will I constantly be waking it? Or worse, what if I get up and drop it? Josh says he’ll have the baby on his side of the bed, which will be safer. ‘I could always make light of my sleep disorder before. In lots of ways it was a nightmare, but I could joke about it. ‘But now that our baby’s on the way, it’s different. Most of all, I really worry that he or she will inherit my condition.’ Yet there is no one better qualified than Jodie to help a child through the disorder.

"Three fathers who have taken on the unusual challenge of wearing 33lb pregnancy suits have declared they have new found respect for pregnant mothers. Jason Bramley, Steve Hanson and Jonny Biggins are taking on the challenge of pregnancy to honour mums in the run-up to Mother's Day. Appearing on ITV's Lorraine the men complained of trouble sleeping, walking and tying shoe laces. Steve Hanson, Jonny Biggins and Jason Bramley (left to right) who have taken on the unusual challenge of wearing 33-pound pregnancy suits for a whole month appeared on ITV's Lorraine . 'It’s the little things that become mammoth tasks - dropping a pen or taking a plug out,' Steven Hanson (left on sofa) alongside Jonny Biggins and Jason Bramley told Lorraine Kelly (far left) Perched on the sofa with their legs akimbo and hands on their fake babies the men told host Lorraine Kelly about the pain of the last 10 day. 'It's been tough, really tough,' said father-of-one Steven, 46, who came up with the crazy idea to help promote a new personalised Mother's Day book by the threesome's publishing company, The Book Of Everyone. 'It's hard in the morning and hard at night, but the most difficult part  is walking to work,' he said. 'We’re allowed a 15 minute shower. But it’s the little things that become mammoth tasks - dropping a pen or taking a plug out.' Fellow pregnant dad Johnny added: 'I've given up doing up my tying shoe laces.' The men, who confirmed that the novelty of having breasts wore off on day one, are ten days into their month-long challenge, which in real life would mean they still have 284 days to go. Scroll down for video . Dads Jonny Biggins (left), Steve Hanson (middle) and Jason Bramley (right) are discovering exactly what it's like to have a baby on board by wearing pregnancy suits for an entire month . 'Every day things like putting on your socks becomes a monumental task,' says Steve, 46, (left) who has a 12-year-old son Saul with his wife Kate . But already the challenge is taking it's toll. ‘On the physical side, carrying this thing around not easy,' said Johnny. Patting his bump, dad Jason, 44, added: 'And we don’t have all the hormones and everything else going on – just this weight.' The publishing directors, are charting the  ups and downs of impending parenthood in an online diary. Steve, who is married to Kate and has a 12-year-old son, called Saul, said: 'Every day things like putting on your socks becomes a monumental task.' The trio are wearing their bumps to work, to the pub and to bed and are only allowed to remove them to wash . The trio, who are from England but all work at an office in Barcelona, are wearing their bumps to work, to the pub and to bed and are only allowed to remove them to wash. Jason, who is a father-of-one mused on day five: 'I wonder why pregnant women don't use wheelchairs. 'I have a chair in the office with wheels and this is a blessing. I can glide effortlessly across the office to my desired destination.' 'On day three I didn't sleep a wink, I just couldn't get settled,' says company director Steve, from Doncaster, pictured on his laptop while wearing the belly . Steve's son Saul is pictured resting his head on his fake breasts, making for quite the funny sight . The 'empathy belly' comes complete with fake breasts and weighs two and a half stone - the average weight of a full term baby bump. It is designed to put pressure on the bladder, stomach and lungs, and cause abdominal distention and the inability to get comfortable. 'On day three I didn't sleep a wink, I just couldn't get settled,' said company director Steve, from Doncaster. 'My boobs, which at first were quite a pleasurable novelty, soon became about as welcome as a fart in a spacesuit,' said Steve (pictured in his 'empathy belly') 'I wonder why pregnant women don't use wheelchairs,' dad-of-one Jason, 44, (pictured) wrote in his diary . The suit weighs 33lb, the average weight of a full term baby, and is designed to cause abdominal distention and put pressure on the bladder, stomach and lungs . 'I tried to make a small city out of pillows around my bump. My boobs, which at first were quite a pleasurable novelty, soon became about as welcome as a fart in a spacesuit,' he added. 'They were way too warm and hung on my arm, sending it to sleep and waking me at the same time.' By day three the constant swinging motion of his belly forced Jonny, 45, from Surrey to visit his local pharmacy and seek medical help. 'I unzipped my jacket, exposing my belly and explaining my predicament to the woman behind the counter,' says Jonny, dad to Enzo, five, and Leo, one. 'I expected her to crack a smile or reel back in shock but she nodded professionally like she's seen it all before, opened a drawer and placed an elastic waist strap on the counter. Despite the trials and tribulations caused by faking pregnancy, the Steve, Jonny and Jason said it has made them appreciate what their wives have had to go through . 'A few minutes later, with belly strapped firmly in place, I waltzed out of there with a new-found spring in my stride. It was wonderful, I could move again.' Yet despite the trials and tribulations just one week in Steve admits to bonding with his 'baby'. He told his  diary: 'It seems to be taking on a personality. It has a name, and its name is Bump. I cradle it, pat it, rub it and I just caught myself talking to it while patting it.' As well as writing down their experiences the dads are also uploading videos of their pregnancy journeys to their online diaries - and all three are looking forward to Mother's Day when they can remove the suits for good. 'Huge respect goes to all you pregnant mums out there. Every single one of you,' said Steve.","Jason Bramley, Steve Hanson and Jonny Biggins are faking pregnancy .

"The world's nine wealthiest women are worth a combined $230billion - though they earned very little of the money themselves. The list of female billionaires continues to be dominated by women who inherited their money from their husbands and fathers who ran booming empires such as Walmart, Mars and L'Oreal. Of the world's billionaires, 286 are women, but only 17 per cent of that group are self-made, according to a report from wealth researcher Wealth-X. Of male billionaires, 60 per cent are self-made, Wealth-X president David Friedman said. Liliane Bettencourt's father founded the French cosmetics company L'Oreal in the 1900s . 1. Liliane Bettencourt, 92: $41.2billion from L'Oreal . Liliane Bettencourt, the 92-year-old heiress of French cosmetics company L'Oreal, surged to the top spot on the list of the world's wealthiest women on Friday when her stake in the firm gained $400milion in value, according to Forbes. The widow, who suffers from dementia and is no longer involved with running the company, inherited her stake from father Eugene Schueller, who first began selling beauty products in the early 20th century. In the 1950s she married Andre Bettencourt, who also worked at L'Oreal after being involved in a French fascist group that collaborated with Nazi persecution of Jews during World War II. He died in 2007 after leaving L'Oreal in the midst of revelations about his past. The years since Liliane's retirement from her father's company have seen her give away large sums of money, though there is currently a fraud trial of ten people accused of using her dementia to swindle her out of millions . Christy Walton, 60, married into the Walton family . 2. Christy Walton, 60: $41.1billion from Walmart . Christy Walton, 60, has been the world's wealthiest woman for long periods of time, including up until Thursday morning. With an accumulated wealth of $41.1billion inherited from her late husband, she holds the largest part of the Walmart empire's fortune, according to CBS. She married into the family through John, son of Walmart founder Sam. However, the retail heir died when a small plane he was piloting crashed in 2005. Christy and the rest of the Walton family made headlines after they did not sign on to Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett's pledge to give half their wealth to good causes while they were alive. The family has given an estimated .04 per cent of their wealth to charity. Sam Walton's daughter Alice devoted herself to art . 3. Alice Walton, 65: $38.6billion from Walmart . Alice Walton, 65, inherited her $38.5billion stake in her father's empire, though she has not been involved in running the business. She instead chooses to devote her time, energy and vast financial resources to art, building a 200,000-square-foot museum filled with modern works in northwest Arkansas, according to Forbes. The heiress's life has not been without troubles, however. Ms Walton, who has married and divorced twice without children, killed a woman with her car in 1988, though no charges were filed. She had a drunk driving arrest in 1998 and another in 2013 where she refused to take a breathalyzer and charges against her were later dropped. Though her primary residence is a horse ranch in Texas, she also owns two floors on Park Avenue where protesters demanded higher wages for her company's workers last year. 4. Jacqueline Mars, 75: $27billion from Mars Inc candy company . SJacqueline Mars's $26.8billion fortune stems from Mars Inc  (pictured 2012) Life for Jacquelin Mars has always been pretty sweet. She inherited $26.8billion from the company that bears her name, which her grandfather started in Washington at the turn of the last century. She shares the company evenly with her two brothers, Forrest Jr. and John. However she had an experience eerily similar to Ms Walton's fatal driving accident in 2013. She pleaded guilty to misdemeanor reckless driving after she ran into a minivan, leading to the death of an 86-year-old woman and causing a pregnant woman to miscarry her unborn child. The heiress paid $2,500 in the case, or .00000009 per cent of her fortune. 5. Laurene Powell Jobs, 51: $19.6billion . Laurene Powell Jobs, 51 (pictured 2013), inherited shares of Apple and Disney from her late husband . Laurene Powell Jobs, widow of late Apple founder Steve, is worth $19.3billion after a career in finance and inheriting stakes in the tech giant and Disney from her 1991 marriage. At 51, the graduate of  Stanford Business School is the youngest member of the list,which has an average age of more than 72. She keeps busy with her own set of initiatives, including running the Emerson Collective, which fosters entrepreneurship for the underprivileged and advocates for education reform. The businesswoman is also on the Board of Trustees at Stanford. Though she generally keeps a low profile, the widow was recently spotted on a Caribbean vacation with former Washington D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty, 44. The pair are believed to have been dating since 2013. Susanne Klatten, 52 (pictured in 2009), worked for her father Herbert Quandt under an alias . 6. Susanne Klatten, 52: $17.2billion from BMW . While the majority of the world's nine wealthiest women are American, the sixth and eighth spots inherited their wealth from German automaker Herbert Quandt, who led the resurgence of BMW in the 20th century. Susanne Klatten, 52, began working for her father's company under an alias before marrying an engineer and inheriting stakes that make her worth $16.9billion. She also owns stakes in a wind turbine company, Nordex, and a chemical company called Altana. The mogul earned a bachelors at University of Buckingham in England, an MBA in Switzerland and has three children, according to Bloomberg. The driven woman's life has not been without difficulties, however. She had an affair with a Swiss businessman who threatened to publish sexual videos of her if she did not pay him $72 million. In 2009 the man was sentenced to six years in prison for blackmail. Anne Cox Chambers, 95, inherited a media empire . 7.  Anne Cox Chambers, 95: $17.1billion from Cox . The only media mogul among the world's wealthiest women, Anne Cox Chamber's inherited her stake in various Cox media ventures from her father James. A vast information empire, Mrs Cox Chambers has shares in companies including Cox Communications cable company, Kelley Blue Book automotive reselling manual and many local television and radio stations. She has remained active in various affairs beyond her father's businesses, however. The heiress served as ambassador to Belgium during the administration of President Jimmy Carter and was the first woman member of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. She also received the French Legion of Honor from Francois Mitterand. 8. Johanna Quandt, 88: $14.4billion from BMW . Johanna Quandt, 88, was the third wife of BMW's Herbert Quandt . Susanne Klatten's mother Johanna Quandt, 88, was Herbert Quandt's third wife after working as a secretary for the automaker. Beyond a large stake of the car manufacturer, which makes vehicles including Minis and Rolls-Royces, she also controls part of a security software company based in the Netherlands. Both parents of Mrs Quandt, maiden name Bruhn, were art historians. She now lives in the German spa town of Bad Homburg, near Frankfurt. Neither Mrs Quandt or Mrs Klatten have ever sold a share of Herbert Quandt's company. The family has come under fire for their links to Nazism during the reign of Adolf Hitler. Herbert Quandt's half-brother Habart was the son of the Third Reich's propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. 9. Iris Fontbona, 72: $13.8billion from various ventures . Chilean Iris Fontbona, 72, received her money as part of an influential family as well as from a marriage to Andrónico Luksic . The ninth wealthiest woman is Chilean Iris Fontbona, 72, who gained her money from her family's copper business and company that owns Banco de Chile. She also married late Croatian-Chilean businessman Andrónico Luksic, and her wealth is currently estimated at $13.8billion. Her assorted business interests also include Chile's largest brewer and a resort in Croatia. The Luksices make investment decisions collectively, as a council. Michele Ferrero, the confectioner who was Italy's richest man, died on Valentine's day and his wife Maria Franca Fissolo is likely to inherit a large amount of his $23billion. Inheriting the entire amount would place her fifth among the world's wealthiest women. Seventy-nine per cent of the world's female billionaires fully inherited their wealth. The largest share of self-made women billionaires is in the US, with 40 per cent of Americans in the group making their own way. China, expected to soon have a larger amount of wealth concentrated in businesswomen's hands, comes in second at 22 per cent. The average age of all female billionaires is 61, with 21 per cent widows.","Liliane Bettencourt is the wealthiest with $41.2billion from L'Oreal fortune .

"Eddie Redmayne has become the darling of Hollywood with his portrayal of Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything, and now the actor is preparing to take on another challenging role - that of Lili Elbe. The Oscar-winner is reportedly already losing weight to play the Danish painter born Einar Wegener who, with the support of his wife, fellow artist Gerda Gottlieb, first started living as a woman and finally became one of the first people to undergo gender reassignment surgery in the 1930s. Directed by Tom Hooper, the film will explore the extraordinary life of a figure who risked her reputation, marriage and finally her life to be the person she felt she should be. Einar Mogens Wegener (left), was born in 1882 and went on to become one of the first transgender women, called Lili Elbe (right) Her life, which was fictionalised in the novel The Danish Girl by David Ebershoff, was optioned to be a film years ago and Nicole Kidman was, at one point, attached to the project. Now Eddie will portray Lili as a man, and after the age of 30  as a woman living among artists in the bohemian Paris of the 1920s and Thirties, with her 'sister' Gerda, who will be played by Swedish actress Alicia Vikander. The film will be both an account of an inspirational and radical figure and also a tender love story between two people whose love for each endured until their deaths. Lili was born Einar Mogens Wegener in Denmark in 1882 and in his late teens attended the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen, where he met fellow artist Gerda Gottlieb. The couple bonded over their love of illustration and dated for a few years, before going on to marry in 1904, when he was 22. The couple travelled in Europe extensively and made their income by working as illustrators and painters for magazines and books, with Wegener living as a man. As a landscape artist, he earned Denmark's Neuhausens prize in 1907 and exhibited at Kunstnernes Efteraarsudstilling (the Artists Fall Exhibition) in addition to the Vejle Art Museum and in the Saloon and Salon d’Automme in Paris. A photograph of Lili in the 1920s . But in his mid-20s, the couple made a discovery that would change the rest of their lives. Gerda needed a woman to pose for a series of illustrations but her model had failed to turn up - instead her  husband did the honours and donned a pair of stockings and heels so his legs could substitute for a female's. Gerda was famous for her paintings of well-dressed, fashionable women with almond-shaped eyes but until 1913, no one knew that the dark-haired beauty regularly depicted in her work was her husband. It was the moment Wegener realised that he felt particularly comfortable in women's clothing and started to develop his female persona, who he called Lili. Soon the artist spent found himself spending more time as Lili than as Einar and she spent less and less time paying attention to her art. According to Lili Elbe's biography, Man Into Woman, edited by Niels Hoyer - a friend of the Wegeners writing under a pseudonym - for a few years Einar only dressed as Lili when Gerda was desperate for a model. But as Lili began to dress more regularly as a woman, the couple decided to settle in Paris, where it was more accepted. During the 1920s and Lili openly attended events in the French capital dressed as a woman, pretending to be Einar's sister. More people became learned about the Wegeners' secret and she and Gerda became known for their raucous dinner parties among the arty set. Slowly, Einar began to feel himself dying, and he realised that Lili was taking him over. And unable to be content with this existence, and convinced he had a naturally female body, Lili met Dr Warnekros of the Dresden Municipal Women's Clinic, who, according to the biography, immediately understood Einar’s problem. She  moved out of the home she shared with Gerda and contacted surgeons about attempting gender reassignment surgery. In 1930, she travelled to Berlin in Germany to have the surgery - something that was completely new at the time. A portrait of Lili by her wife Gelda . Between 1930 and 1931, Lili had five operations to transition into a woman, under the supervision of the eminent German sexual psychiatrist, Dr Magnus Hirschfeld in Berlin. First her testicles were removed, followed by a second op to remove the penis and to transplant ovaries taken from a 26-year-old woman into her body. Unfortunately the body rejected the ovaries and they had to be removed in a third operation, with other corrective surgeries taking place in the fourth and fifth operations. During the operations doctors discovered that Lili had rudimentary ovaries herself, proving that she was intersex - when people have sex characteristics of both male and females, so can't be distinctly classified as one or the other. After her first surgeries she considered herself to be a different person to Einar so Gerda, with Lili's blessing, petitioned the King of Denmark to dissolve their marriage, arguing that the marriage had held Gerda back for too long. And in 1930, the King of Denmark announced the annulment and issued Lil with a passport under her new identity. Eddie Redmayne with his Bafta for The Theory Of Everything. He is now taking on the role of Lili in a new film . Yet her greatest wish was to bear her own children and she underwent risky surgery to transplant a uterus in 1931. But after complications following the radical and highly experimental operation, Lili passed away two days later, before her 50th birthday. Her ex-wife Gerda went on to re-marry, to an Italian military officer called Major Fernando ""Nando"" Porta, but the marriage wasn't to last and they divorced after just a few years.

Michael Schumacher has sold his Norwegian mountain holiday home (pictured) for £2million as he continues to recover from his horrific ski injuries . The 46-year-old (pictured) had owned the 645-square-metre lodge since the mid 1990s and used it as a base for family skiing trips . But the home, which features a spa, a cabin on nearby ski slopes and space for seven cars, has been sold to a foreign buyer for 22 million Norwegian kroner. The Local reports Petter Birkrem from the PRIVATmegleren estate agent as telling the DN newspaper: 'It was his refuge from the media pursuit he has suffered throughout his life. Mr Birkrem revealed that the buyer was not Norwegian adding: 'We had a viewing for this person and his family at the very start of winter. They got a real ""wow"" feeling when they came into the cabin.' The Local reports that earlier plans to sell the house were put on hold because of the seven-time World Champion's devastating accident.

Schumacher, a very competent skier, was holidaying with family and friends in Meribel, France, where he owns a chalet when the accident happened in December 2013. He was skiing with his 14-year-old son on a red piste, which is classed for intermediate skiers. But shortly after 11am, he left the piste and skied on to an off-piste area located in between the red run and a blue run, for beginners to intermediates. It was here that he struck a partially-covered rock. He was not skiing fast but he lost control and catapulted 34 feet on to another rock. He smashed his head on the bolder. The force of the collision shattered his helmet. The footage recorded on a camera attached to his helmet was undamaged. The film, which included audio, captured the crash in full horror and was analysed by police who investigated the accident.

He cleared the ski resort, stating that the piste had been marked correctly and that Schumacher 'deliberately' left the ski run. Schumacher was airlifted from the slopes minutes after the accident to Moutiers Hospital and was then transferred 80 miles west to CHU Grenoble, a larger hospital that specializes in head injuries. He arrived at 12.40pm and had been placed in an artificial coma. He was immediately operated on to relieve pressure on his brain. At the end of January it was announced that doctors had begun the process of gradually awakening him from his coma.

"People living near a picturesque 15 acre beach on the south coast of England will not be allowed to use it after judges at the Supreme Court ruled in favour of its French owners. Five judges sitting at the Supreme Court  unanimously agreed that West Beach in Newhaven, East Sussex, would not be able to become a village green and therefore enjoyed by locals. They ruled the stretch of sand would remained fenced off under the instruction of its owners, a joint venture of French local authorities. The ruling signaled the failure of a campaign by people living in the nearby town to have the beach registered as a village green so they could have unrestricted access to it. Scroll down for video . People living near West Beach in Newhaven have been left disappointed after the Supreme Court ruled a beach near their town could not be a village green, giving them access, siding with its French owners. The closure of the beach has led to campaigns, including by Peter Elms, pictured having a cup of tea on the sand . It is owned by Newhaven Port and Properties (NPP) and judges ruled that giving the beach village green status could hamper NPP's running of the port. Since the beach was closed off in 2008 there have been numerous protests, with townsfolk scaling fences to use the stretch of land and holding a 'protest picnic' on the stretch of sand. Carol Havard, who lives nearby, labelled the decision at the Supreme Court 'crazy'. She said: 'This town has played here for generations. We are a small community and this is the gem in our crown, our uniqueness. 'Brighton has its beach front and we have the beach and breakwater. 'I am not against the French - my husband is French. This is about access to a fantastic place where people have been for generations. It was closed in 2008, leading to protests (left) after barriers were installed (right) because of safety concerns . 'It is an insignificant piece of land but, to us, it is a family beach. 'I know it is about jobs and money but we would have more jobs in this town if we had some degree of tourism. 'We have a tiny town council but they have fought very hard. It is just a crazy decision.' The battle over the beach started in 2007, when the council lodged an application with East Sussex County Council in response to NPP closing the beach because of safety concerns about the harbour walls and steps crumbling. In 2010 the application was accepted and the Court of Appeal ruled that the beach could be granted village green status. But NPP appealed against that decision. Norman Baker (left) and Judith Ost (right), Mayor of Newhaven, said locals are disappointed by the ruling . Campaigner Peter Elms climbs over railings to get to the beach, which has been closed off to locals . Mr Elms had a cup of tea on the beach in protest that the popular family beach remains closed to local people . The case ended up in the Supreme Court and Lord Neuberger, Lady Hale, Lord Sumption, Lord Carnwath and Lord Hodge heard the evidence in November. Yesterday, they ruled that village green status could get in the way of NPP's running of the port. To be registered as a village green land must have been used by a significant number of local residents ""as of right"" for at least 20 years. Politicians have said they will contact NPP, which also owns and runs Newhaven port, to ask them to allow residents to use the stretch of sand. Councillor Judith Ost, Mayor of Newhaven, said: 'We don't have the right to the land but that does not stop them giving permission. The Mayor reads a statement informing locals that the village green campaign has failed following the ruling . Locals have been left bitterly disappointed at the decision and the failure of their campaign for the beach . 'It is in their own interests to have a good relationship with the people of Newhaven. 'They are there on the other side of the river looking for our support with what they are doing, and by and large they have got that.' Mrs Ost and Lewes MP Norman Baker are seeking a meeting with the directors of NPP, many of whom are based in northern France. Mr Baker said: 'Newhaven people will not rest until their beach is open to them once again, and neither shall I. 'This is a bitter disappointment for people in Newhaven, after all the effort that has been put in by the town council and the residents. 'But I want to assure people in Newhaven that we are not giving up. Around 200 protesters held a beach picnic and 100 of them scaled the metal fence in 2013 . Protesters said residents had been 'cruelly barricaded' from the once-popular tourist beach in Newhaven . 'I have already asked for a meeting with NPP to see how we might go forward and to reactivate the idea of the town council coming to an agreement with NPP.' Newhaven councillor Cara Butler, who started a petition to get the village green application started in 2007, called on NPP to recognise the 'strength of feeling' and let people use the beach. A spokesman for NPP said it was glad 'common sense had prevailed' and its planned regeneration of the port would benefit the local community. He said: 'NPP appreciate that this decision will be a disappointment to campaigners, and will now take time to consider the implications of the decision.'

"Plans for an attack on UK soil were found at the Pakistani compound of Osama Bin Laden when it was raided by U.S special forces in 2011, a terror trial has been told. The Al-Qaeda paperwork, featuring correspondence from senior al-Qaeda operatives, also described planned attacks across Europe and Russia, including plans to bomb a pipeline or the U.S embassy in Moscow. The declassified papers were presented at the trial of Abid Naseer, who is accused of plotting to attack Manchester's Arndale shopping centre in 2009. The documents, allegedly found at the compound of Osama Bin Laden (left) were presented at the trial of Abid Naseer, 28 (right), who is accused of planning bomb attacks in Manchester, New York and Copenhagen . The 28-year-old is alleged to have been at the helm of a British al-Qaeda terror cell that was part of a broader conspiracy 'to repeat the devastation of 9/11'. Prosecutors called it one of the most serious terror plots since the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington. As well as blowing up the Arndale Centre, the terror group planned to set off bombs in the New York subway and at the offices of a Copenhagen newspaper that had published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, it is alleged. Naseer, a former student in the UK studying English and computer science, denies the charges. He is being tried in the United States because of the supposed link to the subway. He faces life in prison if he is convicted. At today's hearing in Brooklyn, New York, the documents were read to the court by an FBI linguist who translated them from Arabic. The court was told how the documents discussed a range of al-Qaeda business, from operational tactics to training methods. They also offered suggestions on how to avoid detection by police or secret services, the court heard. One letter stressed the importance of attacking the U.S. 'in its heartland' because it 'has the most significance' and 'cannot be compared' to an attack outside the country, the court heard. Naseer, a former student in the UK studying English and computer science, is alleged to have been at the helm of a British al-Qaeda terror cell. He denies the charges . The goal of an attack would be 'to pressure 300 million Americans,' who vote for their elected officials, to end the nation's war against al-Qaeda and its goal of establishing an Islamic state, the letters said. None of the letters mentioned Naseer by name, but the court was told they made a reference to the arrest of an alleged al-Qaeda operative, showing the intentions of the terror group. Among the documents in the possession of the prosecutors is a letter sent to Bin Laden by senior aide Saleh Al-Somali. 'We sent a number of brothers to Russia and Britain,' the letter read, according to federal prosecutor Zainab Ahmad. Those sent to the UK were given free rein to decide what to do when they got there, the court heard. Through the letter, Bin Laden was then told things had gone smoothly but that there were concerns over a some terror suspects who had been held by British police, the court heard. The letter read: 'We have not ascertained if these had anything to do with us.' Naseer was first arrested in 2009 in Britain with 11 other men suspected of preparing an attack against the Manchester mall, and was extradited to the United States from Britain in 2013. The other men were released without charge, but Naseer was arrested again in July 2010 at the request of U.S prosecutors. Yesterday, five British agents from MI5 gave evidence to the court about their surveillance of the 12 suspects in Manchester and Liverpool as part of what was called Operation Pathway. They told how they given the suspects codenames - Small Panel, Glass Pendant, Happy Skater and Regional Difference. Small Panel was the name given to Naseer. The trial continues.

"Tony Abbott's prime ministership is once again on shaky ground, with his potential rivals forced to insist they are not moving against his leadership. Both Malcolm Turnbull and Julie Bishop weighed in on leadership rumblings on Friday morning after reports indicated Mr Turnbull now has the votes to seize the Liberal leadership. Mr Turnbull has won over many of his detractors on the front bench in a series of private dinners in recent weeks, according to political commentator David Speers. The Communications Minister told reporters this morning that he would not 'fuel' leadership speculation, adding that he had not been calling his colleagues overnight. Scroll down for video . 'Has the numbers': Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull has not moved to challenge the Prime Minister for his leadership . Mr Abbott has dismissed the leadership speculation as 'Canberra nonsense', while Ms Bishop (right) said she wasn't making calls . Ms Bishop was more direct. 'I'm not doing the numbers,' she said in an interview with Fairfax Media. 'The media are obviously ringing backbenchers, I am not and if I were I think people would know that in a heart beat. I'm not doing the numbers.' At a press conference this morning, Mr Abbott dismissed the frenzy as 'Canberra insider nonsense'. But Speers wrote that Mr Turnbull has rapidly improved his reputation among frontbenchers since the leadership vote earlier this month. 'Over private dinners he's reached out to those nervous about putting him back into the top job, particularly those on the frontbench who until now have been loyal to Tony Abbott,' Speers wrote. 'No portfolios have been offered and no support has been directly canvassed. But Turnbull has discussed frankly the challenges confronting the Government with senior and junior ministers.' Mr Abbott defeated a backbencher-led spill motion by 61 votes to 39 earlier this month. No other Liberal contested the leadership. 'Backbenchers are reluctant to bring on another grassroots motion to spill the leadership,' Speers said. 'They want a delegation of ministers to do the deed this time.' Ms Bishop and Mr Turnbull walk behind Prime Minister Tony Abbott as they leave the chamber following the end of question time in the House of Representatives at Parliament House in Canberra on Wednesday . Mr Turnbull was widely touted as a potential candidate if a leadership spill motion went ahead earlier this month . Mr Turnbull has remained publicly loyal to Mr Abbott's government but has distanced himself from some of his decisions in recent weeks. He heaped praise on the 'distinguished' head of the Human Rights Commission, Gillian Triggs, earlier this week after Mr Abbott and senior ministers publicly blasted her leadership. Mr Turnbull has also described a number of Prime Minister Tony Abbott's unpopular decisions - such as the knighting of Prince Philip and dumping of chief government whip Phillip Ruddock - as 'captain's calls'.","Malcolm Turnbull has reportedly won over many of his detractors with private dinners in recent weeks .

"A former NFL star has filed a suit against the state of California for not executing the man who murdered his mother, sister and two nephews 30 years ago. Kermit Alexander, the San Francisco 49ers defensive back who was known for his aggressive play on the field, is about to get aggressive in the courtroom as a Superior Court judge has ruled he does have standing to bring forward a suit demanding that California put in place a protocol to end the life of the man who killed his family. That man, Tiequon Cox, not only knew Alexander, but the former NFL star coached him in Pop Warner football. Scroll down for video . Kermit Alexander, a former defensive back for the San Francisco 49ers, lost his mother, sister and two nephews when they were murdered in 1984 . His sister (left) and two nephews were sleeping when they were killed, while his mother, Ebora Alexander (right), was sipping coffee in her nightgown at the table . 'It galls me,' Alexander told NBC News. 'The people of California have said over and over again that they want this kind of punishment for the worst criminals.' He then added; 'I don't like people getting in the way of the rule of law.' Tiequon Cox (above), a gang member who Alexander coached in youth football, was found guilty of the murders and sentenced to death in 1986 . This case comes at a time when California has 750 inmates on death row, more than any other state in the country. Almost all of their cases are being held up as a result of strong political opposition and ongoing litigation. In fact, since the state approved the death penalty in 1978, only 13 inmates were executed before a judge halted lethal injections, citing the excruciating pain they chemicals caused. This does not matter to Alexander though, a man who worked hard to change his situation after being born one of 11 children to Ebora Alexander of Watts, California. After a successful career, he had come back to Watts, which had become a violent area, and created a youth football program to get kids off the street. That is when he first encountered Cox, who he saw as an angry young man, much like Alexander himself was at that age. Years later, Cox was found guilty of walking into the home of Mrs. Alexander and shooting her as she sat at the kitchen table, drinking coffee in her nightgown. From there he shot 23-year-old Dietra in the eyes as she sat up in her bed, and Mrs. Alexander's two grandchildren,  8-year-old Damon Bonner and 10-year-old Damani Garner, as they were asleep in their beds. He was sentenced to death in 1986. Alexander points out that it is not that he wants to see Cox put to death for what he did so much as he wants the man who murdered his family to be punished in the way a jury determined. 'It's not about the revenge,' he said. 'It's about the law.' Kermit Alexander played ten seasons in the NFL - mostly for the San Francisco 49ers. He retired from the league in 1973 .","Kermit Alexander, a former defensive back for the San Francisco 49ers, lost his mother, sister and two nephews when they were murdered in 1984 .

"Pickup truck driver Jose Alejandro Sanchez-Ramirez will not be charged until an investigation into Tuesday's crash has been completed . A decision on whether charges should be brought against a truck driver involved in a crash that derailed a California commuter train will not be made until the investigation is complete, Ventura County's top prosecutor said on Thursday. District Attorney Gregory D. Totten cited the complexity of the investigation and number of agencies involved in announcing that no charges would immediately be filed against Jose Alejandro Sanchez-Ramirez, 54, of Yuma, Arizona. Totten said, however, that the Oxnard Police Department acted properly in arresting Ramirez for investigation of leaving the scene of an injury accident under state hit-and-run law. In a text message, Ramirez's attorney, Ron Bamieh, said his client will be released from jail but provided no details pending an afternoon news conference. A commuter train's on-board camera captured a fiery crash with a pickup truck abandoned by its driver on Tuesday morning, and federal investigators say the video could give a big boost to the search for a cause. The video, taken from the outward-facing camera on the front car of the Metrolink train bound for Los Angeles, was sent back to the Washington home of the National Transportation Safety Board for analysis, board member Robert Sumwalt said. Sumwalt also said that while the truck wasn't stuck in the way that vehicles sometimes get trapped between railroad crossing safety arms, investigators have not ruled out that the truck was somehow stranded and will determine why it traveled 80 feet down the tracks and remained there with its parking brake engaged. Three cars of the Southern California Metrolink commuter train derailed and tumbled onto their sides after the collision on tracks in Ventura County, northwest of Los Angeles . Workers walk near a Metrolink train engine from a train that hit a truck and then derailed on Tuesday in Oxnard, California . 'I don't think anybody would put a car or truck on ... railroad tracks and not try to get it off if there's an approaching train,' Sumwalt said. The crash in Oxnard, about 45 miles (70 km) northwest of Los Angeles, flipped over three double-decker Metrolink rail cars and derailed two others. It tore apart the Ford pickup truck Sanchez-Ramirez drove onto the tracks after making a wrong turn before dawn. Thirty people were injured, four critically, in the Tuesday pre-dawn crash. Ramirez's attorney has said his client accidentally turned onto the tracks and made repeated attempts to get the vehicle off the rails, and then ran for his life as the train approached. Police said Ramirez was found 45 minutes after the crash 1.6 miles away, though Bamieh said he was only a half-mile away and that he has phone records that show he spoke with police much sooner. Police said Ramirez did not call 911 and made no immediate effort to call for help. But Bamieh said Ramirez, who doesn't speak English well, tried to get help from a passerby, attempted to call his employer, and eventually reached his son to help him speak with police. Police arrested Ramirez on a charge of leaving the scene of an accident with injuries, but Bamieh said he went for help in Oxnard, about 65 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles . 'The reality is he basically freaked out trying to help people,' Bamieh said. 'Did he do everything like James Bond? No, he did the best he could.' He said Ramirez made repeated attempts to get the vehicle off the rails and then ran for his life as the train approached. Sanchez-Ramirez accidentally drove onto the tracks and made the situation worse by continuing forward in an attempt to get enough speed to get his wide pickup over the rails, Bamieh said. When that effort failed, he tried to push the truck and then fled before the impact. 'He hits his high beams trying to do something. He's screaming. He realizes, 'I can't do anything,' and then he tries to run so he doesn't get killed,' Bamieh said. 'He saw the impact, yes. It was a huge explosion.' National Transportation Safety Board member Robert Sumwalt said on Wednesday that investigators have not ruled out that the truck was somehow stranded and will determine why it traveled 80 feet down the tracks and remained there with its parking brake engaged. Ramirez had a drunken driving conviction in Arizona in 1998 and a pair of traffic citations. Bamieh said the citations were minor and the DUI was too old to be relevant to the current circumstances. Flames engulfed the driver's Ford F-450 pickup, but investigators said the engine was intact and may offer clues about what happened . Lives were likely saved by passenger cars designed to absorb a crash that were purchased after a deadly collision a decade ago, Metrolink officials said . The track also used by freight and Amtrak trains was restored to service around 9 a.m. on Wednesday, and commuter trains would begin rolling again in the evening, Metrolink said. Passenger Joel Bingham said many of those aboard the train on Tuesday were asleep and shocked awake when the loud boom first happened. 'It seemed like an eternity while we were flying around the train. Everything was flying,' Bingham said. 'A brush of death definitely came over me.' Eight people were admitted to the hospital of the 30 people originally examined, officials said. Lives were likely saved by passenger cars designed to absorb a crash that were purchased after a deadly collision a decade ago, Metrolink officials said. The four passenger cars remained largely intact, as did the locomotive. A firefighter crawls out of a passenger train car at the scene of a Metrolink accident, Tuesday,  in Oxnard, California . The NTSB planned to examine the effectiveness of those cars, Sumwalt said. The train, the first of the morning on the Ventura route, had just left its second stop of Oxnard on its way to downtown Los Angeles when it struck the truck around 5:45 a.m. The engineer saw the abandoned vehicle and hit the brakes, but there wasn't enough time to stop, Oxnard Fire Battalion Chief Sergio Martinez said. The crossing has been the scene of many crashes over the years. After one killed 11 people and injured 180 others in Glendale in 2005, Metrolink invested heavily in passenger cars with collapsible bumpers and other features to absorb impact. Metrolink spokesman Jeff Lustgarten said the Oxnard crash showed the technology worked. 'Safe to say it would have been much worse without it,' he said. Tuesday's crash happened on the same line as Metrolink's worst disaster, which left 25 people dead on Sept. 12, 2008. A commuter train engineer was texting and ran a red light, striking a Union Pacific freight train head-on in the San Fernando Valley community of Chatsworth.

"Three more young white men, all part of a group that hunted for black people to attack in Mississippi's capital city, have been sentenced to federal prison. US District Judge Carlton Reeves on Wednesday sentenced 25-year-old William Kirk Montgomery to 19 ½ years for his role in the attacks in the spring of 2011 that culminated in the death of 47-year-old auto plant worker James Craig Anderson. Two other men who were part of earlier attacks but not present that night — 22-year-old Joseph Paul Dominick and 23-year-old Jonathan Kyle Gaskamp — got four-year sentences. William Montgomery (left), 25, was sentenced to 19 ½ years for his role in the death of James Anderson. Jonathan Gaskamp (center), 23, and Joseph  Dominick (right), 22, received 4-year sentences for other attacks . The three men, like the seven other defendants in the case, had pleaded guilty earlier. Anderson's death came on the last of a series of forays to what the group called 'Jafrica' — a combination of Jackson and Africa — to assault black people. It ended in a hotel parking lot where the group spotted Anderson, who appeared to be intoxicated. James Anderson, 47, was beaten and run over in 2011, leaving behind his partner of 17 years, James Bradfield, with whom he was raising a child . Montgomery and six others were present as John Aaron Rice and Deryl Paul Dedmon beat Anderson. As Dedmon left in his truck, he ran over Anderson, inflicting fatal injuries. The horrific incident was captured on a hotel surveillance camera, drawing widespread national outrage. After the sentencing Anderson's family members repeated their emotional condemnation of the acts that led to the death. 'I want you to understand what you took from me, what you took from my family,' said James Bradfield, Anderson's partner of 17 years with whom he was raising a four-year-old child. 'There is no sentence that is going to be good enough for you.' The inquiry that followed Anderson's death revealed that the group, including Dominick and Gaskamp had repeatedly driven around, throwing beer bottles and shooting ball bearings from a slingshot. One night, Gaskamp was among those who beat an unidentified man at a golf course. Another night they tried to run someone down. 'Yes, they had done it before and no one died, and the court believes, but for the death of James Craig Anderson, they would have returned to Jafrica again and again,' said Reeves, who is black. 'They would have continued their mission to harm, their mission to hurt.' All three expressed remorse before sentencing. 'There are no right words for me to be able to say how sorry I am,' Dominick said. 'There are no words to right the wrongs.' 'It was the worst mistake of my life and I can't take it back,' Gaskamp said. Reeves urged the men to make good on their promises of redemption. U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves, who sentenced the three remorseful men, urged them to make good on their promises of redemption and commit to making a positive difference in the New Mississippi . 'Justice will not be complete unless these defendants — unless you — use the remainder of your lives to learn from this experience and fully commit to making a positive difference in the New Mississippi; that Mississippi which is only two years shy of celebrating its bicentennial,' Reeves said. 'Prove to your family, your friends and all those who have read about this case that you were worth saving.' Reeves sentenced Dedmon to 50 years and John Aaron Rice to 18 years on February 10. That day, he also sentenced Dylan Wade Butler to seven years. Dedmon is also concurrently serving two life sentences in state prison after pleading guilty in a Mississippi court in 2012 to capital murder and hate crime. Two more men and two women face sentencing in April.","The three men were part of a group of 10 who repeatedly searched Jackson, Mississippi, for black people to attack .

"Two weeks passed before they found Douglas Gissendaner - still slumped forward, as he had died, on his knees in a remote patch of Georgia woodland. He had been bludgeoned and stabbed up to ten times in the neck. His fallen glasses were smeared with grime and his body had been picked at by animals. In its own twisted way, it had been a crime of passion. Douglas's wife, Kelly, had convinced her boyfriend that he had to prove his love by killing the man she said stood in their way. It's difficult to imagine a more cold-blooded means for a wife to have her husband dispatched, and next Monday, Kelly Gissendaner will pay the ultimate price for her sins. Death Row: Kelly Gissendaner (pictured) will become the first woman to be executed in Georgia since 1945 . Conspiring: She convinced her lover Gregory Owen to kidnap and stab her husband Douglas (pictured) to death . Murderous partners: Kelly (left) arrived at the woods while her boyfriend Gregory (right) was killing her husband and helped set his car on fire to destroy any forensic evidence . The first woman to be executed in Georgia since 1945, she has languished on Death Row for 17 years, the only female. Lack of exercise and a prison diet put paid to the pretty face and slim figure that once drew men to her. Gissendaner, who is 46, has already chosen a last meal of cornbread, two cheese burgers, two large portions of chips, cherry vanilla ice-cream, popcorn, salad with buttermilk and lemonade to wash it all down. That is just one of the rituals for condemned prisoners on their final day. There is a last meeting with loved ones and supporters, a talk with a spiritual adviser and the preparation of the last words. Then, finally, watched through a glass window by a small group of the victim's relatives and local media witnesses, she will be strapped to a stretcher in a small execution chamber. At that point, she will be allowed to deliver a few sentences before she is injected with a cocktail of chemicals designed to put her to sleep painlessly and then stop her heart. There is, however, no guarantee the process will go smoothly, given recent scandals over injections which left Death Row prisoners in agony for prolonged periods before they died. What makes this execution the subject of such fascination, however, is the fact it is a woman who is being legally killed. Locked up: Gissendaner, who will be the first woman to be executed in Georgia in 70 years, ordered a massive 'last meal' consisting  over 2,400 calories . Kelly will become the first woman to get the death penalty in Georgia since Lena Baker, who was executed in 1945 after being convicted of killing her employer . Inevitably, executing female prisoners poses unique ethical quandaries. Experts say juries are often reluctant to send women to Death Row. One in ten suspects arrested for murder in America are women, but only one in 50 of those given death sentences and just one in 100 of the prisoners who are eventually executed is female. Equally, there is a counter-argument that in the most heinous murder cases, the jurors can feel such disgust at a woman's involvement that their gender can work against them. That appears to have been so at Kelly Gissendaner's trial. Another twist in the case has deeply troubled legal experts. For while the mother-of-three was sentenced to death, her former lover Gregory Owen - the man who actually carried out the killing - escaped with a life sentence that could see him out of prison less than ten years from now. After accepting a controversial plea deal to testify against his partner in crime, Owen admitted his guilt and helped prosecutors portray Gissendaner as the case's Lady Macbeth - with her suggesting the murder, planning it and urging him to do it. He might have been 'the bullet', as the lead prosecutor liked to phrase it, but she was 'the gun'. Death penalty: Kelly will be executed on Monday but her then-boyfriend who killed her husband was handed a life sentence and could be free within the next decade . Broken family: Kelly's  three children (two pictured) - now grown up - were fathered by different men of whom Douglas was one . The court heard how Kelly was born to a poor cotton farmer father and a mother who now works as a prison officer, and was sexually abused as a child by a string of men. They included an uncle and even her stepfather, who slept with the then ten-year-old girl for six months under the pretence of helping her get used to a new bed. When she grew up and married Douglas Gissendaner, their relationship was a rocky one. Between 1989 and 1996 they married, divorced, remarried, separated and reunited. Her three children, now grown up, were fathered by different men — one of whom was Douglas. Both Gissendaners spent periods in the U.S. Army, and Kelly even worked briefly as a prison officer. They moved to Auburn, Georgia, in December 1996. But Douglas didn't know that his wife had found a boyfriend — Gregory Owen — while they had been separated. She rekindled that relationship after she returned to Douglas. Owen said he had suggested she divorce Douglas, but she insisted her husband would never leave her alone. She also appears to have anticipated a decent pay-out from his life insurance policy. So it was that she hatched a plot to be rid of him. Chilling past: The court heard how Kelly (pictured) was born to a poor cotton farmer father and a mother who now works as a prison officer - and was sexually abused as a child by a string of men . One evening in February 1997, Kelly drove Gregory Owen to her home and gave him a truncheon and a large hunting knife. She left him inside, waiting for her husband to return, while she went off to dance at a local bar. Douglas, who had spent the evening helping friends from their local church repair their car, got back at 11.30pm. Owen surprised him and drove him - at knifepoint - to a remote wooded area, before walking him deep among the trees and ordering him to kneel down. First removing his victim's watch and wedding ring - to make it look like a robbery - he knocked Douglas out with a blow from the truncheon and then stabbed him repeatedly. Kelly arrived at the woods while the killing was in progress and, afterwards, helped set fire to Owen's car to destroy any forensic evidence. The following morning, she raised the alarm over her missing husband, even playing the worried wife in TV appeals. By the time police found the body, she had discovered to her fury that his life insurance policy was worth only around £6,000. Following the murder, police and friends were struck by Kelly's apparent lack of emotion, but her biggest mistake had been telling friends she had a boyfriend. Police discovered Owen's connection to her and arrested the pair two days after the funeral. Both were told they faced the death penalty unless they accepted a plea deal - testifying against each other in return for a life sentence with no chance of parole for 25 years. Gissendaner refused, but Owen agreed, and a jury convicted her of murder with malice in 1998. Statistics show that Gissen- daner's case is almost unique in America's grim history of capital punishment. For example, of the 1,402 murderers executed since the Seventies, only five were conspirators (rather than the actual killer). Though she is desperate to live, there is no doubt Gissendaner has faced a miserable existence for a long time. As the only woman on Death Row in her state, she has lived in complete segregation from other inmates in a women's prison outside Atlanta. She spends 15 hours a day in a 9ft by 12ft cell with a six-by-nine-inch window. Her meals are slid through a hatch three times a day, and whenever she needs to leave her room, even to have a shower, she is handcuffed. 'I deserve to be here, but I don't deserve to die,' she said ten years ago. 'How can you justify me being here when [her former boyfriend Gregory Owen] could be walking the streets one day?' In previous clemency applications, clergymen and prison officials described her as a changed woman, a 'truly redeemed person' who had genuinely found God. Even her children said they have forgiven her and wanted her life spared. The same people made last- ditch pleas to the state's board of pardons and parole at a hearing on Tuesday, with officials saying that Gissendaner had now become a committed Christian. Although not present at the hearing, she said in a statement: 'There are no excuses for what I did. I will never understand how I let myself fall into such evil.' However, with the victim's family joining prosecutors in opposing clemency, calls to halt the execution have fallen on deaf ears. In truth, she always had little chance in such a hardline state: in January, Georgia executed a decorated Vietnam veteran for murdering a policeman, despite evidence he had been affected by post-traumatic stress disorder. The next execution was of a man with an IQ of only 70. Yesterday morning, the parole board ruled that Gissendaner should indeed be executed. She will be moved from her women's prison to a men's facility, the Georgia Diagnostic And Classification State Prison, 114 miles away, where she is to be put to death in its small execution block. There seems little doubt of her guilt, even if her punishment raises many questions. The last woman to be executed in Georgia, 70 years ago - in an age of open racial prejudice - was a black maid named Lena Baker who killed her employer. She claimed he had tried to imprison her, and she had acted in self-defence. Nine years ago, the same pardons and parole board which heard Gissendaner's final appeal gave Baker a full posthumous pardon. But for the woman who ordered her husband to be slaughtered like an animal in the woods, there is to be no mercy.","Kelly Gissendaner sentenced to death for plotting her husband's murder .

"One in 20 drivers have illegally paid someone to take penalty points for them, according to a new study. The research found six per cent have asked a friend or relative to take their points and a shocking five per cent confess to paying someone. But only half of those who have swapped points say they were caught (54 per cent) and as a result 39 per cent of motorists are calling for point swapping drivers to face criminal prosecutions. Former cabinet minister Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce each received eight month prison sentences two years ago for perverting the course of justice after they lied about swapping speeding points. Data retrieved through a Freedom of Information request also showed a staggering 70,158 motorists are on the brink of being banned, holding nine points - just three from a potential ban. The Confused.com FOI request revealed the lengths people go to avoid penalty points when caught speeding . Meanwhile, more than 6,800 motorists in the UK have 12 points or more on their licence. Extraordinarily, one UK driver, who is still on the road, has a staggering 45 points, clocked up for nine speeding offences and 36 of failing to disclose the identity of the vehicle driver. The data was gathered by the car insurance comparison site Confused.com and showed the lengths people are willing to go to avoid a driving ban. Of the motorists who admit swapping points, more than half have done so at least three times and more than one in seven think the penalty point system is not fit for purpose. The most common reason for swapping points with someone else is to keep their license clean, while a quarter of motorists admitted asking someone to take them because they were facing a driving ban. In total, 2,928,222 motorists currently have penalty points on their licence. The study found more than a third of us have received points for a motoring offence, with 80 per cent of these due to speeding. Absurdly, more than one in 10 motorists (11 per cent) even claimed they didn't know the practice of swapping penalty points is illegal. Drivers are legally obliged to inform their insurers they have points on their licence, however more than one in six admit failing to do so. Former cabinet minister Chris Huhne and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce were jailed for lying about switching points . Many drivers said they would commit a crime by taking points for a family member. Three quarters of drivers who said they would take someone else's points (72 per cent) said they would do so for their partner and a third said they would take points for their child, parent or sibling. More than a third of those who have taken points for someone else (37 per cent) defended their decision to do so by saying the driver in question could have lost their job. The research also revealed some professions are more inclined to swap points than others. In total, 2,928,222 motorists have penalty points on their licence after falling foul of speed cameras . Motorists who work in the hospitality industry topped the list of professions trading points, followed by those who work in property and those who work in research. Young drivers seem to be more likely to swap penalties, with 15 per cent of drivers aged 18 to 24 admitting to asking a friend or family member to take points, compared to just seven per cent of those aged 35 to 44. The driver with 45 points is still on the road as a result of a loophole in the system which states an MS90 offence (failing to disclose the identity of the vehicle driver) is not something someone can be disqualified for. Gemma Stanbury, Head of Motor Insurance at Confused.com said: 'It's concerning to see that one in 20 motorists (five per cent) admit taking on a friend or relative's penalty points. 'Avoiding penalty points for a motoring offence means many drivers who are prone to offences, such as speeding, remain on the roads, where they may pose a risk to others. 'Penalty points are designed to deter drivers from repeatedly breaking the law and to penalise those who do. 'The police are aware there are drivers on the roads who are illegally swapping points, and motorists should remember the police have direct access to DVLA data where they can look at anyone's driving record to compare photos. 'It can be easy for the police to match photos using DVLA information, and to check whether the person taking points is the vehicle's driver. 'Incurring multiple sets of penalty points can result in motoring fines, increased insurance premiums, and even disqualification from driving, so motorists should always drive safely and responsibly.'","Research found six per cent have asked a friend or relative to take their points and five per cent confess to paying someone to do it .

"In the face of criticism from the President of the Human Rights Commission and even members of his own party,Tony Abbott believes he should receive a ‘ big tick of approval’ for his actions around people smuggling and ‘stopping the boats’. Mr Abbott, who’s approval rating as risen to a four month high, backed himself and the actions of the former Immigrations Minister, Scott Morrison, saying the report released by the commission investigating the conditions of children held in detentions is a ‘political-stitch up’. ""This government has lost confidence in the president of the Human Rights Commission."" Won't back down: Mr Abbott lambasts Human Rights Commision President after the release of her report labelling the detention of children by the Australian government unlawful . However, not all Liberals are singing the same tune with the Communications Minister, Malcom Turnbull speaking out on behalf of Ms Triggs, highlighting her stellar reputation in the legal community as a ‘very distinguished legal academic’. Amidst all the controversy he says it’s important to focus on the issue at hand which is the 211 children still detained in Australia and the 199 children on Naru. Communications Minister Malcom Turnbull (pictured left)  defends Trigg (pitcured right) after vicious attack by his own party members . ‘The issue is not Gillian Triggs, or personalities, or arguments about the Human Rights Commission. The issue is the children,’ he said. The 10-month-long inquiry found prolonged immigration detention causes significant mental and physical illness. Between January 2013 and March 2014 records show there have been of hundreds of cases of assault, 128 cases of self harm and a sickening 33 reports of sexual assault . The report has labelled the Australian governemt’s practices as a clear violation of international human rights law, calling for a full royal commission into the detention of children. A picture paints a thousand words: Drawings by children in detention, featured in 'Forgotten Children' report . The Liberal government denies their criticisms of Ms Triggs are an attempt to discredit the report. Immigration Minister Peter Dutton hit back saying the report is ‘historically’ representative of previous Labor government’s policies which saw peak numbers of children in immigrations detention centres at nearly 2000 in mid 2013, a number Mr Abbott claims is now under 200. His comments come as the Australian Federal Police are set to investigate claims that the government offered Ms Triggs an incentive to resign from her role as the nation’s human right executive. Labor wrote to the AFP on Wednesday initiating the investigation into whether the offer of a senior legal role for Ms Triggs constitutes a bribe. Mr Abbott insists Prof Triggs was not asked to resign and no inducement was offered.","Report by Human Rights Commission labels immigration practices unlawful .

"A transgender hip-hop performer who called herself 'the Michelangelo of buttocks injections' claims she thought a British break dancer who died after their appointment was merely drunk. Padge-Victoria Windslowe, who rapped under the name 'Black Madam,' is accused of murdering Claudia Aderotimi, 20, after an appointment at her makeshift salon in Philadelphia in 2011. Aderotimi fell into respiratory distress immediately after Windslowe injected her with low-grade silicon and died later that night, a court has heard. On Thursday, Windslowe, 45, testified at her murder trial that she has been haunted by Aderotimi's death ever since. Charged: Windslowe is accused of killing British student Claudia Aderotimi after injecting her with industrial-grade silicone that caused heart failure . Tragic: Claudia Aderotimi, from London, died in February 2011 after receiving a silicone injection in her buttocks in her pursuit of a bigger bottom . Accused: Though she had no medical training, Windslowe (above) would charge up to £1,200 per injection . She said an intermediary informed her of the death the next morning by saying the phrase: 'R.I.P., Baby.' 'The way she said it was just ... really cold, really indifferent,' Windslowe said. 'I say that because 'R.I.P,' that rang through my soul for four years.' Windslowe is accused of using a mix of industrial-grade silicone and glue that spread to Ms Aderotimi's brain and lungs, causing heart failure and killing her. She said she has injected 'thousands' of people since being trained by a doctor in Thailand and one in South America who performed her 1994 sex-change operation. Prosecutors say Windslowe's reckless injections injured numerous clients, several of whom testified of debilitating injuries after their procedures at airport hotels and 'pumping parties' went awry. Investigators this week told jurors Windslowe ordered silicone by the gallon and syringes by the case in a side business that she ran under the name 'Lillian.' On the stand Thursday, Windslowe said she first went into the cosmetic surgery business in Thailand, when she was trained by a 'Dr. Chimcoke,' and ultimately opened a medical tourism business with him called 'The Secrets of the Orient.' Her role was to organize group trips for Americans, she said. Her other entrepreneurial efforts have included running an escort service; making Gothic rap music under the Wrath Entertainment record label; Svengali music management services; a bail service for adult entertainers called The Risque Group; and skin care work done under the banner 'BioBeauty Labs.' She first did the enhancements for a transgender friend in 1995. 'She (the friend) did it to help sculpt the secondary male characteristics into female, to help transsexuals pass more on the street and basically not get harassed,' Windslowe testified. 'So that's where body sculpting came from.' Flirt: Padge Victoria Windslowe (left) flirted with Philadelphia Assistant District Attorney Carlos Vega (right) during her murder trial . Unlicensed: Windslowe is also charged with practicing medicine without a license and aggravated assault for an injection she gave another exotic dancer . She did such stellar work, she said, that people of various genders and occupations started demanding it. 'Everyone was calling me ""the Michelangelo of buttocks injections,""' Windslowe said at a pretrial hearing last week. Police around the country have investigated at least two similar deaths involving other suspected faux surgeons, but Windslowe may be the first to be charged with murder. Prosecutors have charged her with third-degree murder, which can bring a sentence of 20 to 40 years in prison inPennsylvania. She is also charged with aggravated assault for allegedly injuring an exotic dancer at a New Year's Eve 2011 'pumping party' in Philadelphia, when she injected a group of dancers on a dining room table. The woman spent two weeks in the hospital with respiratory problems, after silicone particles that moved to her lungs were too small to remove surgically. Some former clients testified they fear the medical problems that may lie ahead. A woman from New York testified about spending months in the hospital with respiratory distress after getting injections from Windslowe. Like others, she said she learned about her through a website and arranged the appointment through an intermediary. Police believe Windslowe frequently switched locations and used different names to avoid detection — and fled when anyone was injured. They investigated Aderotimi's death for 18 months before filing the murder charges.","Claudia Aderotimi, from London, died in 2011 following silicone injection .

"She has never made any claims to being a brilliant businesswoman but it seems that is exactly what Pippa Middleton is. The Duchess of Cambridge's younger sister has raked in nearly a quarter of a million pounds in the last year, according to figures released by Companies House. Pippa is the sole director and shareholder of PXM Enterprises Limited which has assets totalling £229,241, including £211,521 in cash in its first year. Business brain: Pippa is the most successful Middleton after making a profit of £229,241 last year . By contrast, the companies belonging to younger brother James have never posted a profit and two have now been de-registered. The two, Nice Cakes Ltd and Nice Wine Ltd, had assets worth just £20 when they closed, according to Companies House paperwork. As a result, Pippa has made approximately £229,221 more than her brother in the period between the company’s incorporation in May 2013 and the end of May last year. In it, she lists the nature of the business as being 'Other publishing activities', perhaps in a reference to her much-maligned party book, Celebrate!. Along with the book, Pippa, 31, is believed to have earned the money with a number of writing assignments, which including her regular column for supermarket magazine, Waitrose Kitchen. Chip off the old block: Pippa takes after her mother Carole, who is also an accomplished businesswoman . Not so good: James, despite being entrepreneurial, has had considerably less success . Losses: James, seen here at Prince George's Christening, closed his Nice companies early this month . She also penned a series of columns in her position as a contributing editor of Vanity Fair and another for a British newspaper. Her other source of income comes from her parents' company Party Pieces, where Pippa is employed to edit web magazine, the Party Times. The documents show that after paying creditors  £115,000, her business was left with a profit of £115,192. Despite not being considered the business brain of the Middleton clan, Pippa has so far managed to outdo brother James and follows in the footsteps of their mother Carole, who is also a first-class businesswoman. He is currently concentrating on his latest venture, bespoke marshmallow firm Boomf, which is yet to file accounts. Writing: Pippa has made most of her money via a series of writing jobs, including a Vanity Fair column . Doing well: Her other source of income is editing her parents' Party Times online magazine . His other business, The Cake Kit Company, is still trading but according to Mr Middleton, sells only 'business to business'. Speaking in an email sent to Daily Mail journalist Sebastian Shakespeare early this month, he added: 'The companies I’ve requested to be struck off have never traded. 'My work focus at the moment is just on Boomf, which is proving to be a very excited [sic] business.’ Mr Middleton has, at least, had something to celebrate. Along with Pippa, he is recently returned from a trip to the Caribbean where they celebrated Carole's 60th birthday. With them in Mustique were the Duke of Cambridge, who arrived in Japan today, the Duchess of Cambridge and 18-month-old Prince George.","Pippa made £229,241 according to accounts posted at Companies House .

"Lawyers for the Boston Marathon bombing suspect asked a judge on Thursday to dismiss the indictment against their client or suspend his trial, saying there weren't enough minorities and young people in the jury pool. The move by lawyers for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev came just days before opening statements and testimony are set to begin in his federal death penalty trial. In their written motion, Tsarnaev's lawyers say the selection process has undermined the required random summoning of potential jurors. They also say the process violated Tsarnaev's constitutional right to have a jury that represents a 'fair cross section of the community'. Lawyers for Tsarnarev, seen in a January 5 2015 courtroom sketch, have asked a judge to dismiss the indictment against their client or suspend his trial, saying there weren't enough minorities and younger people in the jury pool . The defense said 1,373 people, summoned from a population of about 5 million in eastern Massachusetts, were originally given numbers based on a random pool order list. New numbers were later assigned, based on when the jurors reported to court to complete written questionnaires. The defense argues that the reordering undermined the randomness of the selection process and pushed certain groups — including blacks, people under 30 and people who live in Boston — down on the list and made them less likely to be chosen for the jury. Only about half of the 1,373 people summoned were considered based on their written questionnaires or questioned individually. 'This re-ordering, apparently based on non-random factors such as arrival time, had systemic effects on the order. The re-ordering was not random and had nonneutral effects on cognizable groups,' they wrote in their motion. For example, a statistician hired by the defense found that the reordering of prospective jurors, on average, pushed the number of black jurors back 43 positions in the order of selection and moved potential white jurors up by three positions. Prospective jurors who live in Boston were pushed back 25 positions, and those under 30 moved back 13 slots, the defense said. The statistician, comparing the reordered jurors to their original order, found there were no prospective black jurors among the first 94 people in the new order. He said there would have been five potential black jurors if the court had kept the jurors in their original order. The defense also argued that the process violated the constitutional cross-section requirement by allowing people over 70 to opt out of jury service. Tsarnaev's lawyers said nearly 96 percent of people over 70 who were summoned as potential jurors opted not to serve. They also argued that the process did not identify enough prospective black jurors. They said although black people make up 6.14 percent of the population eligible for jury service, they make up only 4.25 percent of the list of names drawn for jury selection. Suspect: Tsarnaev, 21, is accused of carrying out twin bombings at the 2013 Boston Marathon. The explosions killed three people and injured more than 260 . A spokeswoman for prosecutors declined to comment. The judge did not immediately rule on the request. Tsarnaev, 21, is accused of carrying out twin bombings at the 2013 marathon. The explosions killed three people and injured more than 260. Opening statements in the trial are scheduled for March 4. Tsarnaev's lawyers have argued repeatedly that the trial should be moved out of Massachusetts because of the emotional impact the bombings had in the state and because many people have personal connections to the case. They've been turned down three times by Judge George O'Toole Jr. but last week argued before the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The court has not yet issued its ruling. Jeff Denner, a veteran Boston defense attorney who is not involved in the case, said he doesn't see a contradiction between the defense push to move the trial out of Massachusetts and its complaint that jurors who live in Boston may have been underrepresented. 'Your first choice would be to get it to a place outside the district of Massachusetts. Your second choice, if you can't do that, you still want at least the people you identify as perhaps having more favorable viewpoints from a defense perspective,' Denner said. 'I think they've made a determination that those people are more likely to be upscale urban dwellers who are likely to be more educated and more likely to be more receptive to the kind of political arguments to be made against the application of the death penalty in this particular circumstance.'","Lawyers for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev asked a judge Thursday to dismiss the indictment against their client or suspend his trial .

"These despicable images show four men about to be put to death by ISIS in Iraq, apparently because they are spies. The shocking pictures emerged just hours after campaign group CAGE defended Jihadi John, today unmasked as west London student Mohammed Emwazi, as 'beautiful' and a man who 'wouldn't hurt a fly'. The scarcely believable comments about Emwazi were made by CAGE leader Asim Qureshi at a press conference in which he blamed MI5 for radicalising the University of Westminster graduate. Scroll down for video . The victims are blindfolded and lined up ready to be shot by Islamic State fighters in the horrific images . The alleged spies, clearly terrified, are marched to their deaths under the murderous eyes of their killers . The ISIS fighters hold aloft the handguns with which they have just shot and killed the four 'spies', whose bodies are slumped before them on the ground . In the guise of Jihadi John, Emwazi has apparently been responsible for the beheadings of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines and taxi driver Alan Henning, and American aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig, also known as Peter. The gruesome murders were filmed, expertly edited and distributed in the name of Islamic State. Jihadi John's trademark black hood can be seen covering the faces of the four executioners in the latest pictures, thought to have been taken in Salahuddin province in Iraq. Each man was accused of being part of a spy ring and were executed under the crime of spying for the Baghdad government. Clad in the familiar orange jumpsuits the victims, named as Sabi Khalif Mohammad al-Taghi, Mohammad Mahdi Salah al-Jamili, Abdullah Mahmoud Abdullah al-Khamili and Salwan Saidy Suleiman al-Jabouri, are pictured being marched into a clearing under the dark gaze of their killers. Amid bright sunlight filtered through surrounding trees, they are photographed standing separately while their three alleged accomplices kneel with their heads down in the background. Suleiman al-Jabouri fixes the camera with a defiant gaze, moments before he is apparently shot and killed .

Sabi Khalif Mohammad al-Taghi appears more afraid as he is shown with his alleged accomplices behind . Some of their faces show defiance and others fear, before they are lined up on their knees with their black-clad killers standing behind. In gut-wrenching images the four are then seen slumped on the ground, apparently having been shot in cold blood, as their ISIS murderers raise hand guns in the air. Blood pools around the heads of the dead men, which are shown in close-up in images too horrific to reproduce. Earlier today Qureshi was branded an ISIS sympathiser as he appeared to launch a defence of Emwazi and his barbaric crimes. He described Emwazi as 'the most humble young person that I knew', adding: 'He was such a beautiful young man, really. 'It's hard to imagine the trajectory, but it is not a trajectory that's unfamiliar with us. 'When are we going to finally learn that when we treat people as if they're outsiders, they are going to feel like outsiders and they will look for belonging elsewhere.' About to meet his death, Mohammad Mahdi Salah al-Jamili is pictured handcuffed my the militants . The four, including Abdullah Mahmoud Abdullah al-Khamili, were killed because they were allegedly spies . He also revealed that he'd been in regular contact with Emwazi before he left for Syria. In the wake of Emwazi's unmasking as the world's most wanted man, CAGE yesterday released a statement entitled 'Jihadi John: 'Radicalised' By Britain'. The release stated that Emwazi 'desperately wanted to use the system to change his situation, but the system ultimately rejected him,' a view later echoed on CAGE's press conference, which was broadcast live on both BBC and Sky News. Qureshi then used the statement to criticise the British security services, arguing that counter-terror measures turned young Muslims into extremists. Other videos have emerged of Qureshi suggesting he is a jihadi apologist, including oneat an anti-US rally in London at which he is filmed urging protesters to 'support the jihad of our brothers and sisters' in Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine and Chechnya. Qureshi can be seen speaking through a microphone at the the pan-Islamic Hizb ut-Tahrir movement rally. CAGE leader Ashim Qureshi (left) pictured at the press conference where he defended Mohammed Emwazi, seen right in the guise of the infamous Jihadi John . Qureshi pictured at a London rally at the height of the Iraq war in 2006 calling for protesters to 'support the jihad of our brothers and sisters' He says: 'When we see the example of our brothers and sisters fighting in Chechnya, Iraq, Palestine, Kashmir, Afghanistan, then we know where the example lies. 'When we see Hezbollah defeating the armies of Israel, we know where the solution is and where the victory lies. 'We know that it is incumbent upon all of us, to support the Jihad of our brothers and sisters in these countries when they are facing the oppression of the West. 'Allahu Akhbar! Allahu Akhbar! (God is great, God is great!)' Qureshi stands alone on a stage in the 54 second clip, shot at the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars in 2006. And in a second video, in which Qureshi is quizzed by Juliane Assange on his view of Sharia law, in particularl stoning, he said: 'I agree with Islamic concepts of how we practice our punishments.' Asked if he believes in the use of the death penalty, he added: 'From an Islamic perspective, yes. As long as all the due process elements are met.'","Despicable images show four men about to be put to death by ISIS in Iraq .

"Radio DJ Mel Greig is one of the latest female Australian celebrities to have stepped in front of the camera to tackle the sort of vile abuse dished out online. Ms Greig, who was famously engulfed in scandal in 2012 after she participated in a radio prank call to the London hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for morning sickness, was subjected to particularly brutal comments, in a video posted on Mamamia. Shortly after the incident, the English nurse, Jacintha Saldanha, who took the call, sadly committed suicide and in a note she left blamed the radio presenters for ending her own life. Scroll down for video . Radio host Mel Greig reads one of the vicious attacks sent to her on social media . Ms Greig, who was famously engulfed in scandal in 2012 after she participated in a radio prank call to the London hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for morning sickness, was subjected to particularly brutal comments. Ms Greig was part of another batch of female Australian celebrities have stepped in front of the camera to tackle the sort of vile abuse dished out online . 'I've made a noose Mel, and it belongs around your neck. I can't wait to take your last breath,' one tweet read. 'You've killed a mother so it's only fair we kill yours. You'll never sleep again. I'm coming for you and your mum,' another said. A third tweet read: 'An eye for an eye. Kill yourself or I'll kill you and everyone you care about.' Ms Greig leaves court in London last year, after an inquest into the death of Jacintha Saldanha . ABC journalist Annabel Crabb, former model and now human rights campaigner Imogen Bailey, radio host Mel Grieg, Today Show presenter Sylvia Jeffreys, Mamamia Editor-in-Chief Jamilia Rizvi and Mamamia TV host Shelly Horton took part in the video. Model Imogen Bailey copped the worst of the bad bunch, sent a tweet reading: 'I hope they cut off your dumb f**king head you dumb Muslim lover b***h.' Journalist Annabell Crabb was called a 'Orwellian s**t and dead soul c**t', in one of the tweets sent to her. Mamamia's post says the video is 'not to be laughed off'. 'In Australia, more than one in three women have experienced some form of violence since the age of 15,' the article reads. 'Ninety percent of those cases will be perpetrated by men. On average 1.5 women die each week at the hands of their partners. 'So when we see women who are bold enough to have their say in public receive threats of violence and sexual abuse, we do really have to take this seriously.' Mamamia, who filmed and posted the video, said the sort of insults dished out are 'not to be laughed off' 'In Australia, more than one in three women have experienced some form of violence since the age of 15,' the article reads . 'Ninety percent of those cases will be perpetrated by men. On average 1.5 women die each week at the hands of their partners . The original video, published last week, shows Lisa Wilkinson, Tracey Spicer, Sarah Harris, Mia Freedman, Rosie Waterland and Sam Frost reading out the varying degrees of gender abuse they are objected to on a daily basis. The most disturbing was a tweet sent to journalist Tracey Spicer, which she was filmed reading out calmly as she sat in her car. Journalist Tracey Spicer was among six Australian television personalities to read out the harsh and violent comments they are subjected to on social media every day . 'I hope your children are raped and killed, you silly c**t,' it read. While many tweets and social media posts were physically threatening, the women were just as easily subjected to personal attacks on appearance. 'You obviously don't shave your bush, cause it's hidden under your massive gut,' writer Rosie Waterland copped. Today host Lisa Wilkinson read out various tweets for an online video by Mamamia showcasing social media users attacking her physical appearance . The Bachelor's Sam Frost was told: 'I love Sam like I love my sister. Bear in mind I ate my sister in the womb'. Studio 10 host Sarah Harris, who was also featured in the video, told her program on Thursday she received a 'disgusting tweet' a few days ago from a man threatening to rape and murder her. 'I sent it to Twitter and said can we report this guy and they said it doesn't breach our guidelines,' she said. 'I don't feel that he would follow through, but that's not okay. You shouldn't be able to post that crap online.' The Bachelor's Sam Frost read out the varying degrees of gender abuse they are objected to on a daily basis . The person behind the video, Mamamia editor Kate Leaver, told Daily Mail Australia a lot of people wouldn't be aware these women are being targeted with verbal abuse on a daily basis. 'I just want as many people as possible to understand why this kind of abuse - rape threats, sexually charged threats, death threats - happens,' she said. 'That type of language is what creates a society where violence against women is acceptable. 'Usually the conversations is about how to deal with it - like blocking people on Twitter. We want to start the conversation earlier than that and understand why it happens.' Writer Rosie Waterland was attacked over her physical appearance, something all six women are trying to showcase in the online video . Mamamia's Mia Freedman read out her tweet calmly with a blank expression for the cameras . Ms Leaver said the abuse was gender specific because women who put an opinion out there were subjected to personal attacks, whereas men were often just attacked on their idea. 'Shockingly it comes at you from all angles. We have another two videos to come out with another bunch of high profile women. Everyone we speak to says they get it on a daily basis,' she said. Studio 10 host Sarah Harris hit out saying gender abuse on social media was not okay and people shouldn't be 'able to post that crap online' During an appearance on Studio 10 on Thursday, Ms Leaver said it was extremely difficult to get social media sites to take notice of abuse. 'CEO of Twitter came out recently and his longer statement essentially was ""we really suck at dealing with abuse on Twitter and we're sorry"",' she said. 'It's so hard. You don't have to authenticate your identity, you could create accounts in 100 different names and stay at home attacking people all day long.'","Famous Australians have read out harsh  tweets they receive  daily .

'It does not fit in our area at all - it's pretty rare to see a car like this. 'I get tickled when people see who is driving it - they'll often speed up to get a good look and are always surprised when they see a 56-year-old woman behind the wheel.' She admits she was shocked when it first arrived and has enjoyed some of the attention the car gets her. She added: 'It was very out of the blue I did not believe it for a minute - I thought it was a scam. It's a very fast car - I have never had my foot on the floor. 'It will go so fast so quickly that I've been told you need to keep it in a straight line to keep it on the road - It feels like you're flying.

Enjoyed the attention: Ms Parker admitted the car was 'fun to drive', adding: 'Everywhere you go it turns heads - people want to look at it and talk to you' But driving a customized car can make parts extremely expensive and the grandmother says many are inaccessible and impossible to replace. With a heavy heart the family is looking to offload the Banshee to a collector who can afford to take care of it - and they are going to use the money so send Ms Parker's son Austin to college. 'I'll be happy and sad to see it go', added Cheri. 'It is a fun car I enjoy driving it but at the same time it takes up space in our home and it's not practical to drive to the grocery store in it. 'According to West Coast Customs and Rockstar the car is valued at $180,000 dollars but I'd be happy getting $70,000 (£45,000) for it.' The decision to sell the Banshee has been hard on Ms Parker's 19-year-old son Austin. The Banshee comes in a number of different colours and can reach speeds of up to 174mph on the game .

Austin added: 'It's a really nice car but we need the money for other things, we don't need the car to be happy.

"A little girl who cannot walk or talk has seen her modelling career go from strength to strength after she was selected to star in a fashion shoot for a major supermarket. Holly Greenhow, aged nine, from Hemingford Grey in Cambridgeshire, has Athetoid Cerebral Palsy, which severely affects her movement, balance and speech, but amazingly she has now taken part in two modelling campaigns. The pretty school girl, whose condition was caused by a prolonged loss of oxygen at birth, was picked to star in the latest modelling shoot for F&F children's clothes at Tesco. Holly Greenhow, nine, from Hemingford Grey in Cambridgeshire, has Athetoid Cerebral Palsy, which means she can't walk or talk. But the primary school pupil is taking the modelling world by storm and has posed for both Boden and Tesco. Pictured: Holly in the new Tesco ad campaign . Holly, who uses a wheelchair and communicates using a special computer system operated by her eyes, shone at the shoot and now features on the fashion pages of the Tesco website. She has previously done a photo shoot for fashion retailer Boden and her mother Fiona hopes her growing success will help to change attitudes to disability. Fiona said: 'Holly really enjoyed the modelling shoot for F&F. She had her hair and make-up done and was given lots of attention. 'There are so many activities she can't take part in because of her disabilities, such as dancing, so this was a real treat for her.' Holly with her mother Fiona . She continued: 'She loves clothes and choosing her own outfits so modelling is a great thing for Holly to do and I'm really pleased she has been given another opportunity.' Holly, who has an older brother Oliver who is 11, was born with Athetoid Cerebral Palsy and although she understands everything, her movement, balance and speech are impaired. Despite her disabilities, she attends main stream school, where she is doing well, and enjoys swimming, horse riding and wheelchair sports. 'She has really grow up in the last couple of years and is doing very well at school and becoming more independent,' added Fiona. 'She is able to go out at break times with her friends now and they look after her instead of a teaching assistant, which is lovely. 'Academically she is also moving on, but because of her communication issues everything takes a little longer.' Holly poses with two fellow models in an ad campaign for Boden . The Boden campaign was the first of Holly's modelling jobs . Holly also had eye surgery last year to correct a squint, which means she now finds it easier to use an eye gaze computer system that helps her communicate in a similar way to Professor Stephen Hawking. Fiona said: 'The eye surgery worked really well and she has a lot of her big teeth now, which have come through perfectly, so she has a beautiful smile. 'She is also on a special anti-Parkinsons drug which means she doesn't dribble now, so in all ways she is really growing up.' Holly has always enjoyed choosing her own clothes, so Fiona thought she might like to try modelling and she did her first shoot for Boden in 2013. She enjoyed it so much that Fiona took her for further castings and she was picked for the Tesco campaign last autumn. Holly (left) modelling the new range of F&F clothes for Tesco . Holly spent a day modelling with other children and appears on the Tesco website in a pretty pink top, pink heart leggings and brown boots. Fiona added: 'I wasn't sure if the Boden job would be a one hit wonder so I'm thrilled that Holly has been given another opportunity to do some modelling. 'It also sends out a very positive message for other children with disabilities.' Lucy Wheeler, head of multi-channel content at Tesco, said: 'We were delighted to offer Holly the chance to appear on the F&F website. 'Holly really enjoyed the shoot and was a pleasure to work with throughout. We wish her all the best for the future.' Holly uses an eye gaze computer system that helps her communicate in a similar way to Professor Stephen Hawking . Holly's mother Fiona said her daughter really enjoyed modelling in the Boden ad campaign . Richard Hawkes, CEO of disability charity Scope, added: 'It's great to see more and more household brands like Tesco using disabled models in their campaigns. 'Holly's ongoing success shows that there is real appetite for diversity. 'We've also seen disabled models taking centre stage at New York Fashion Week - including Jack Eyers, who fronted our Strip for Scope campaign last year. 'There have been some positive recent breakthroughs, but there is still a long way to go. 'We want to get to a point where the media and marketing worlds better reflect the diverse society we live in.'","Holly Greenhow, nine, from Hemingford Grey, has Athetoid Cerebral Palsy .

"Firefighters had to helplessly watch a home in Maine burn to the ground because they couldn't get their fire trucks up the long driveway, which hadn't been plowed and was covered in snow. Fire Captain Glen Kirkpatrick says firefighters were called to the home in Woolwich - north of Portland, Maine -  at about 9pm on Tuesday to find the house with fire shooting from windows. However the 1,500 foot driveway had not been plowed, trapping the trucks about 20 feet in. Firefighters then walked to the property but could do no more than monitor the fire. Destroyed: This home in Woolwich, Maine, burned to the ground Tuesday night after the house caught fire and emergency workers couldn't access the property, due to an unplowed driveway . Ablaze: It is unclear how the fire started on Tuesday however the owner's pet cat and dog were killed . Unplowed: The 1,500 foot driveway was covered in snow and had not been plowed, preventing fireighters from accessing the house . The water hoses couldn't reach the two-story home. They tried to shovel snow onto the flames but the house was already too consumed. I would say we were helpless,' Kirkpatrick confirmed to local station WGME. 'First time in 25 years I've ever had that happen.' Firefighters described the snow on the walking path to the house as 'knee deep'. Within about a half hour of crews arriving, the two-story house collapsed. The home's lone occupant made it out safely. Sadly, his pet cat and dog were been killed after getting caught in the blaze. The pets are believed to have been in the house. Firefighters were able to save a nearby shed. The cause of the fire is unclear but does not appear suspicious. 'Keep clear driveways and pathways for Fire, EMS, and police officers,' Kirkpatrick said.

"The boss of the Royal Bank of Scotland has admitted that it could be years before taxpayers get their money back. As the State-backed lender announced a seventh consecutive year of huge losses, Ross McEwan could offer little assurance to households who contributed to its £46 billion bailout in 2008. The New Zealander said it was ‘certainly not going to be months’ before the bank was ready to return to the private sector, before adding it would be ‘much shorter’ than ten years. Scroll down for video . Ross McEwan, chief executive of RBS yesterday announced losses of £3.5billion during a press conference . Andy Sylvester, from the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said Mr McEwan’s remarks ‘will leave taxpayers cold’, adding: ‘The bank bailouts have placed a tremendous burden on taxpayers and it is a weight that needs to be lifted.’ The bleak prognosis came as RBS, which is 79 per cent owned by taxpayers, slumped to a £3.5bn loss last year. This takes its total losses since its collapse to almost £50bn, and the news wiped more than £1bn off the bank’s value as shares fell more than 4 per cent to 386.6p. Expectations had been high that RBS could be returning to normality, having made a £2.6bn profit in the first half of the year, but a £2.2bn bill for fines and litigation and a £4bn charge on its US business have blown it off course. The huge loss is also a setback for George Osborne, who had been hoping both RBS and Lloyds would be back in the black before the election. It also came as another pay row flared up, with RBS dishing out £483 million in bonuses to staff – although this was down from £576m the previous year. Mr McEwan, who forfeited a £1 million shares payment for the second year running after taking the helm in October 2013, said the bonus culture was ‘not something I am going to change or can change today’. He added: ‘I need to be in a position to pay fair pay for people to do these jobs. There are some fairly technical jobs that we need to get right.’ But Mr Osborne said the bank must go further to curb pay. The RBS news will be a disappointment to Chancellor George Osborne, picture, wanted the see the bailed-out bank back in the black in advance of the election . In a letter to Sir Howard Davies, the boss of the Airports Commission who was confirmed yesterday as RBS’s new chairman, he said: ‘I look to you and Ross McEwan personally to ensure that the entirety of the bank’s business is conducted to the very highest ethical standards.’ He added that his priorities included turning RBS into ‘a British bank focused on the British economy, with lower bonuses and with a plan to get the taxpayers’ money back’. Last night Cathy Jamieson MP, the shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘While it’s good that Ross McEwan has taken a lead on rejecting his allowance, people will be taken aback at the scale of bonuses.’ Former chairman Sir Philip Hampton said it was ‘like Groundhog Day’, adding that the bank’s litigation charges – which turned a £3.5bn profit into the huge loss – had overshadowed a ‘really impressive year of achievement’.","RBS  yesterday announced the seventh year of consecutive losses .

"These are the pictures which prosecutors say prove an alleged al Qaeda operative accused of planning a series of bombings was scouting locations to mount an atrocity. A court in New York has released the photographs - taken around the city center of Manchester, England - which form part of the evidence against Abid Naseer. The 28-year-old Pakistani student was extradited from Britain to stand trial in the U.S. over charges of planning multiple attacks in Europe and America. If convicted, he faces life in prison. Naseer is accused of leading an al Qaeda cell that was planning to bomb Manchester’s Arndale shopping centre over the Easter weekend in 2009 – as well as a separate plot to attack the New York subway. These are the pictures which prosecutors say prove Abid Naseer (not pictured) an alleged al Qaeda operative accused of planning a series of bombings, was scouting locations. Pictured is his friend, Tariq ur-Rehman, at dozens of locations around Manchester . Photographs submitted by the prosecution and released by a New York court today show his friend Tariq ur-Rehman at dozens of locations around Manchester - they were recovered from Mr Rehman’s mobile phone and a USB flash drive . He never faced charges in the UK and the evidence against him has only emerged six years after his arrest. Naseer is alleged to have been at the helm of a British Al-Qaeda terror cell that was part of a broader conspiracy 'to repeat the devastation of 9/11'. Prosecutors called it one of the most serious terror plots since the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington. As well as blowing up the Arndale Centre, the terror group planned to set off bombs in the New York subway and at the offices of a Copenhagen newspaper that had published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, it is alleged. Naseer, a former student in the UK studying English and computer science, denies the charges. He is being tried in the United States because of the supposed link to the subway.

Naseer (pictured above, right with beard - Rehman, on the far left in March 2009) is accused of leading an Al-Qaeda cell that was planning to bomb Manchester’s Arndale shopping centre over the Easter weekend in 2009 – as well as a separate plot to attack the New York subway . He never faced charges in the UK and the evidence against him has only emerged six years after his arrest . They include him at Manchester’s Trafford Centre, Cathedral Gardens, Piccadilly Gardens and the Arndale Centre in 2007 and 2008. Two further sets taken nine days apart in August 2008 show him only in and around the Arndale Centre, a fact the prosecution alleges shows the cell closing in on their final target. They included pictures of him outside several retail stores, including a branch of Primark and the glass frontage of the centre’s flagship Next store. Robert Dyson, who works as a crime reduction officer for CityCo in Manchester, advising businesses, was asked by the prosecution to examine the photos. 'They appear to be at all exit points to the building,' he said on Monday. 'They are main exit points.' Naseer and Rehman were both arrested in April 2009 with eight other Pakistani men studying in the UK. No explosives were found at their home and they never faced charges in the UK. Naseer was extradited to face trial in the U.S. in 2013. The prosecution alleges they were part of a global Al-Qaeda conspiracy to use operatives with visas or passports allowing them access to Western countries. Naseer is accused of using email to stay in touch with an Al-Qaeda commander in Pakistan as they planned their attack.

Naseer listens to statements in his trial as seen in a courtroom sketch . In particular, the court has been shown an email he sent to his alleged handler saying he had set a date for a nikah - or Muslim marriage ceremony - for the Easter weekend, in what the prosecution believes was Al-Qaeda code for a bombing. Giving evidence on Thursday, Naseer insisted he had never used any codes or knowingly been in touch with Al-Qaeda members. Instead he said he had come into contact with the suspect user when posing as a woman online to chat with other women. 'The messages were of an innocent nature, asking about the welfare of the individual, conditions of the weather,' he said, adding that he went on to brag about the number of women he knew and his plans for a wedding once he became aware the recipient was a man. James Neuman, for the defence, said: 'Did you ever send a coded message?' Naseer replied: 'I did not send him any coded message.' He has also denied knowing any members of Al-Qaeda or ever being asked to buy materials for an explosive device. 'Killing innocent people is incompatible with Islam,' he said. Earlier this week the court heard from five disguised MI5 surveillance operatives who described Naseer’s movements around Manchester and Liverpool in the month leading up to his arrest.

"Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has revealed that he currently has no interest in signing players in January, despite the club's poor form. Last season's Premier League runners-up spent £113million in the summer but many of the new players have failed to settle. And Rodgers believes the focus should be on recreating the spirit of last season, rather further squad additions. 'It (buying new players) is not something I am looking at,' the 41-year-old said. 'After the weekend, the focus was not to dwell on that. We have to learn from that and try and get a result here. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Brendan Rodgers: We're Liverpool FC and we'll never give up! Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has revealed that he has no interest in signing players in January . 'I just need to get us back to a level of confidence that allows you to perform. Losing can be the making of you. You learn from it. That is what we are aiming to do.' Rodgers' side was characterised last season by the intensity of their play, but that seems to have disappeared, and the former Swansea boss is intent on regaining that confidence. 'When you don’t have so much coaching time, it is mostly psychological what you are trying to achieve.  If we focus on that too much there is no way we could play to our level.

Rodgers said he had a good relationship with the club's owners and they had been very supportive of him . 'We need to make sure the training ground is a happy place to be. We have lost more than we would have liked. But the next game is an opportunity. You try to affect the players in a positive way. 'Sometimes it just takes a game, an action to change a season for you. We have to believe that can happen. We haven’t been anywhere near our levels. But you can never give up. 'We have to believe that the honesty of the group will get us the results and that is what we will keep working towards.'

"She was the green-eyed 'Afghan Girl' who shot to global fame when a haunting picture of her appeared on the cover of a 1985 issue of National Geographic magazine. Now a picture of Sharbat Gula is in the news again - but it's a very different image. A recent picture of Gula, looking less striking, is washing around in a row about corruption in Pakistan. Sharbat Gula shot to fame as a green-eyed 12-year-old on the cover of National Geographic in 1985 (left), but a more recent image of her (right) is circulating in media as part of a row about corruption in Pakistan. It was taken from her identity card - a document she technically shouldn't have been allowed to acquire . The haunting image of the then 12-year-old Gula, taken in a refugee camp by photographer Steve McCurry, became the most famous cover image in National Geographic's history. After a 17-year search, McCurry tracked Gula down to a remote Afghan village in 2002 where she was living married to a baker and the mother of three daughters. However, she's being investigated because Pakistani officials discovered she was living in the country on fraudulent identity papers. This week the picture from her computerised national identity card surfaced in national media. It's an ID card that as an Afghan national, she's not allowed to have. Pakistani officials say that Gula applied for a Pakistani identity card in the northwestern city of Peshawar in April 2014, using the name Sharbat Bibi. She was one of thousands of Afghan refugees who managed to dodge Pakistan's computerised system and to get an identity card last year. Faik Ali Chachar, a spokesman for the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), told AFP the Federal Investigation Agency was probing Gula's case. US photographer Steve McCurry poses next to his photos of 'Afghan Girl' Sharbat Gula at an exhibition of his work in Hamburg, Germany in June 2013 . Pakistani officials say that Gula applied for a Pakistani identity card in the northwestern city of Peshawar (pictured) 'This is one of the thousands of cases which was detected last year and sent to the FIA. We are waiting for the findings of the inquiry,' Chachar said. 'Our vigilance department detected (the) Sharbat Bibi case in August 2014 and sent it to FIA for further investigation the same month.' Many Afghan refugees try to get Pakistani ID cards every day using fake documents, Chachar said. 'Around 23,000 cards of Afghan refugees were detected and blocked' in the 12 years since NADRA was launched, Chachar said. In her official registration with NADRA, Gula said she was born in January 1969 and gave Peshawar as her place of birth. The photo attached to the application has the same piercing green eyes and the same sculpted face seen in McCurry's famous image only older, lined by age and surrounded by a black hijab covering her hair completely. An AFP reporter visited the poor Peshawar neighbourhood given as Gula's address in her papers, where residents said she had been living with her husband, who worked in a local bakery, but had left a month ago. A senior official in NADRA's Peshawar office, where the cards were issued, confirmed the investigation and told AFP that Sharbat Bibi and her two sons Rauf Khan and Wali Khan were issued cards on the same day. He said all the documents she used to get the card, which only Pakistani citizens are entitled to, were fake and her 'sons' were likely also not related to her.","Sharbat Gula shot to global fame on the cover of National Geographic .

"A British holidaymaker has received £2,000 in compensation – from her own lawyer – after she claimed she tripped over a sleeping flight attendant on a British Airways flight. Shaunna Baynes, from Dagenham, east London, received the payout from her solicitor as an apology after he missed a deadline to bring court proceedings against the Heathrow-based carrier. She claimed she fell over a cabin crew member who was sprawled across an aisle in business class during a flight home to London after visiting Elvis Presley’s mansion, Graceland, in Memphis, Tennessee. Shaunna Baynes, 42, said she suffered the injuries after visiting Elvis Presley's mansion in Memphis . The holidaymaker said she tripped over a sleeping flight attendant on a British Airways flight . Mrs Baynes told the Barking and Dagenham Post she was in so much pain after the incident in November 2012 that she was forced to use a mobility scooter for six weeks. The 42-year-old was seated in business class on the transatlantic flight after he husband bought the ticket as a surprise 40th birthday present. But she said the birthday present was ruined and she doubts she will fly again after tripping over the male flight attendant while walking to the toilet at 2am. Mrs Baynes told the Post: ‘He was sleeping there. His whole body was lying right across the aisle. I broke my nose, bruised my arm and did my hip in. Mrs Baynes was seated in business class after he husband bought her a ticket for her 40th birthday . ‘An old woman came and picked me up. I dread to think [what would have happened] if it had been an elderly person who tripped.’ She suffers from osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and a spinal fracture, and said the fall aggravated those conditions. Mrs Baynes hired London lawyer Peter Cornish, from Amwells Solicitors, to pursue a claim against British Airways. He said he filed a claim but missed a deadline to initiate court proceedings. The Dagenham woman was flying back to the UK after visiting Elvis Presley's mansion, Graceland . He said he has been a personal injury claim solicitor for 13 years but was unaware that there is a two-year limitation period on claims involving flights as he never deals with such cases. He told MailOnline Travel he offered £2,000 to Mrs Baynes because it was the amount of compensation they were seeking from BA. He said: ‘Mrs Baynes, all along, all she ever really wanted was an apology from BA. ‘It was a case we may or may not have won, and because I missed that date I felt obliged to do the right thing by Mrs Baynes.' A British Airways spokesman told MailOnline Travel: 'We are sorry that Ms Baynes hurt herself during one of our flights. We investigated the claims and could find no evidence to support them.'","Shaunna Baynes said she fell over a cabin crew member in business class .

"The woman who caused traffic mayhem during peak hour after falling asleep behind the wheel has admitted to smoking cannabis before getting in the vehicle. The 37-year-old woman was driving a rented van full of suitcases southbound over the Sydney Harbour Bridge which witnesses say crossed into a northbound lane and crashed into another vehicle on Wednesday morning. This resulted in a five-vehicle accident on the bridge just after 6.45am, with traffic stretching back for 21km in all different directions to Sydney's city centre after all northbound lanes plus two of the five southbound lanes on the bridge were closed off.

Kimilsungia: Dancers carry symbols of the Kim dynasty, in this case representations of the Kimilsungia - a type of purple orchid . Choreography: The Mass Games involve 100,000 performers, all either doing gymnastics or dancing . End of an era: Kim Jong Un has said the Mass Games won't be held in 2015 - and possibly never again . But the future of the event, which began in 1946 and was last held in 2013, looks increasingly uncertain, with Kim Jong Un's regime seemingly set on shelving the Arirang altogether. Designed to promote the Workers Party of Korea, the armed forces and the Kim dynasty, the Arirang Festival started life in 1946 and was, from the start, littered with regime iconography. Rising suns, which represent Kim Il Sung, feature heavily in the costumes, as do guns which are a reference to Sung passing 'the struggle' on to his son Kim Jong Il and grandson Kim Jong Un. Flowers are a popular prop, with red representing workers and purple the Kim dynasty. Unsurprisingly, many are Kimilsungia, a type of purple orchid, and Kimjongilia, a crimson begonia. Big day: The event was held at Pyongyang's main stadium and usually had a military flavour . Free pass: Soldiers were given free tickets to the event as a reward for good behaviour . Celebration: The military personnel were there to see the army - and the ruling Kim dynasty - celebrated . Practice: In the months leading up to the event, Pyongyang was the scene of regular drills . Getting it right: Instructors with loudspeakers told the massed ranks of gymnasts exactly what to do . Result: The colourful spectacle that ensued was the result of months of training . Symbolism: Many of the dances symbolised workers, with apples and girls in iridescent dresses seen here standing in for farmers . Tribute: Other tableaux focused on the Kim dynasty. These gymnasts are holding Kimjongilias - a type of crimson begonia . Colour symbolism: These sailors are followed by gymnasts holding Kimiljongias and purple fans - both representative of the regime . Kim's colours: Clutching Kimjongilias and dressed in purple, these gymnasts are advertising their loyalty to the regime . Tough job: Many of the performers, in particularly the gymnasts, are drawn from local schools . Armed forces: Attractive female soldiers also play a big role in proceedings, their job to highlight the armed forces . Impressive: Another highlight of the Arirang Mass Games were the mass military parades - complete with giant flags . Popular: All members of the armed forces were represented, whether sailors, soldiers or pilots . But propaganda aside, what really makes the Arirang Mass Games stand out are the sheer numbers involved. '100,000 athletes took part in the show I saw,' explains Lafforgue. 'Then, there were 20,000 teenagers sitting at the back of the stadium holding cards and making pictures. To make a soldier, 2000 of them were needed while it took all 20,000 to make a Korean flag.' Awe-inspiring though the sight was, Lafforgue says some of the people-art hints at North Korea's more sinister ambitions. 'Some of them showed atoms, which symbolise the nuclear bomb, while others showed the two Koreas together under the Kim dynasty's rule.' The show also has a military flavour, with sexy female soldiers in uniforms and garters sent out to dance in front of troops, mostly men, who had been given a free pass to the show as a reward for good behaviour. Despite its massive scale, the Arirang lasts for just one hour with attendees going straight home afterwards. 'All the thousands of people in the stadium just vanished into the streets,' Lafforgue recalls. 'Pyongyang's streets are really dark and quiet so the contrast with the stadium was almost shocking. It felt very unreal, like being in a terrifying and fantastic alternate universe.' Surreal: Whirling gymnasts in green and white combine to create a psychedelic scene . Well-rehearsed: A group of girls, all dressed in Kim dynasty purple, march en masse . Extraordinary: Thousands of performers take part in each Arirang Mass Games, although the future is now uncertain . One for the workers: The colour red is also used to symbolise the workers, Communism and the Kims . Pretty: Rows of dancers clutching fans designed to look like Kimilsungia orchids perform at the Mass Games . Unusual combination: Each segment combined dance and gymnastics with the marching military . Alternate universe: Photographer Eric Lafforgue says watching the performances was like being in a different universe . Elaborate: This scene references Kim Jong Il's birth, which, according to North Korean myth, took place in a mountain log cabin . Showing allegiance: This tableaux features the Communist flag, complete with the hammer and sickle once used by the USSR (now Russia) Vast: The Mass Games take over Pyongang's central stadium for the last time in 2013 .","Dictator Kim Jong Un has shelved plans for a 2015 edition of the Arirang Mass Games .

"A 16-year-old girl died after she swallowed up to eight 'bombs' of a drug nicknamed 'Dr Death' at a party, a court was told. Ellie Jones began stumbling, shaking and suffering fits 'like she was possessed' after taking para-methoxyamphetamine (PMA), at a house in Warrington, Cheshire, it was heard. The former Catholic schoolgirl died in hospital just hours after taking the hallucinogenic drug, which has a similar effect to ecstasy but is much more poisonous. Tragic: Ellie Jones, pictured, began stumbling, shaking and suffering fits 'like she was possessed' after taking PMA, a drug which has a similar effect to ecstasy, at a house in Warrington, Cheshire, a court heard . A 17-year old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, appeared in court today accused of supplying Ellie and another teenager with PMA on the night of her death in May 2013. Halton Youth Court was told that Ellie spoke to the defendant on the way to the house party. One 17-year-old witness, known only as Boy A, said Ellie was overheard telling the defendant that she 'only had a fiver' and he replied that she could give him 'the other fiver' the following day. He then left the group for a few minutes claiming he was 'nipping round the corner.' At the party later that evening, where the group were drinking vodka and beer, the suspect was seen with a plastic bag of white powder. The witness told the court that the defendant started offering the substance to Ellie and other party guests. They took the drug wrapped inside cigarette paper and swallowed it whole like 'a bomb'. Ecstasy is considered pure when made with a strong concentration of the chemical MDMA. PMA, or PMMA, has a similar effect, but is much more poisonous. The effects of PMA, which include heightened intensity of emotions and alertness, take longer to set in than those of MDMA. As such drug-takers are more likely to double their dosage under the mistaken impression the substance is having no effect on them. According to Frank, a drug counselling organisation, a quarter of a tablet containing PMA is enough to kill. It can cause body temperatures to soar to fatal levels, bring on muscle spasms and sees blood pressure increase. Ellie was just one of more than 10 young people within a 60-mile radius of Manchester whose deaths in 2013 were blamed on the drug. Gym instructor Travis Barber, from Salford, was just 19 when he suffered a violent fatal reaction to PMA. Boy A said the defendant told him the drug was 'Whizz'. He added that Ellie had taken 'plenty' of bombs, but could not be sure exactly how many. He said: 'I say six but it could have been seven or eight or four or five. I definitely seen the defendant hand it over to Ellie several times. Every time he had one she matched it.' The court heard that Ellie went upstairs to bed and appeared 'drunk' and 'sleepy'. The witness added: 'She did seem a little bit restless. Me and [another guest] were upstairs for about 10 minutes whilst Ellie was sleeping. Me and [the friend] sparked up a joint. He told the court that seemed 'comfortable' in bed and was falling asleep when they left to go back downstairs but when they returned she seemed as though she 'was getting agitated, restless.' He said: We had to get her up and put her in another room. From about 10 minutes later in that room she started fitting. Everyone was panicking, no one knew what to do.' The court heard the defendant had already gone to bed. Boy A added: 'He was sleeping. He didn't care. He was in the other room. He was holding his head, he didn't know what to do. 'Ellie must have been fitting for a good 20 minutes. [A girl] was trying to sit her up but she was too strong. 'They were saying ""it's like she is possessed, she is possessed"". I was like ""what you on about she isn't possessed she is unwell"". 'I'm sure I grabbed somebody's phone and as I called them, Ellie stopped breathing.' He said of the suspect: 'He was not helping one bit. He was talking s***. 'When she stopped breathing the ambulance was on the phone. I was pumping her chest. I already knew how to do CPR. The former Catholic schoolgirl, pictured, died in hospital just hours after taking 'bombs' of the hallucinogen. A witness told the court that the defendant was seen offering Ellie white powder on the night of her death . 'As soon as the paramedics arrived I went. I didn't know that she was going to die. I knew that she wasn't well, she was fitting. 'In my eyes I didn't do nothing but help out that night. I'm here for the justice to Ellie.' He said had been 'scared' at the time to tell the ambulance operator on the phone that Ellie had taken drugs adding, 'why would I when I'm a kid and scared of saying stuff like that on the phone'. He said: 'It's drugs isn't it plus I was only 15 at the time, plus I was drunk, plus we were all mates at the time. At the time maybe I didn't want anyone to get to trouble and I was scared.' He later admitted not telling police how Ellie got the drugs but said: 'It was because I didn't want to get anyone into trouble. 'I was 15 at the time. All them were older than me. I didn't have a clue. I hadn't been in that position.' Prosecutor Miss Wendy Newton said: 'The defendant was dishing out this drug, wrap an amount in a cigarette paper and swallow it whole known as a bomb several times. 'He was offering the drug to Ellie who took several of these bombs. 'Over the course of the evening Ellie Jones and the defendant are described as looking increasingly intoxicated. 'In particular, Ellie was stumbling and swaying and she felt sick. She was sitting on the floor and may have vomited. 'It is accepted the defendant went to bed before everyone and that Ellie 's condition is then described as deteriorating over the next few hours and she is helped to bed. 'She was described as shaking and restless, that she was hot and sweaty and he couldn't understand what she was saying.' The ambulance took Ellie to Warrington Hospital at 3.30am but she died shortly before 5am. Tests showed she had PMA in her blood was 'within the range associated with fatalities from the drug'. A vodka bottle seized at the scene was found to contain alcohol and PMA. The defendant was one of three teenage boys arrested over the tragedy. He denies supplying Class A drugs. The trial continues.

"Bill O'Reilly, pictured in 2013, has been challenged about reporting in El Salvador during his time as a CBS correspondent . Bill O'Reilly is facing new claims that he fabricated a story about witnessing the execution of four nuns in El Salvador during the country's civil war. The allegations came days after liberal watchdog, Media Matters for America, questioned O'Reilly's report that in 1977 he witnessed the suicide of a friend of JFK shooter Lee Harvey Oswald, and Mother Jones disputed his coverage of the Falklands War. O'Reilly claimed he has 'seen guys gun down nuns in El Salvador' and 'was in El Salvador and I saw nuns get shot in the back of the head' while working at CBS, according to Media Matters. The Fox News man appeared to be referencing a well-known case of four nuns executed by the Salvadoran national guard in December 1980. Experts in the El Salvadoran conflict have said that following the tragedy, there were no church people killed in the country for more than eight years. However O'Reilly's book, The No Spin Zone, claims that he did not begin to cover the civil war in El Salvador until 1981. O'Reilly responded to the El Salvador allegations in a statement to Mediaite. He said: 'While in El Salvador, reporters were shown horrendous images of violence that were never broadcast, including depictions of nuns who were murdered. The mention of the nuns on my program came the day of the Newtown massacre (December 14, 2012). 'The segment was about evil and how hard it is for folks to comprehend it. I used the murdered nuns as an example of that evil. That’s what I am referring to when I say ''I saw nuns get shot in the back of the head.'' No one could possibly take that segment as reporting on El Salvador.' The latest allegations came as book publishers for O'Reilly said on Monday that they stand behind his work despite questions that have been raised about his reporting. O'Reilly's series of books about the deaths of John F. Kennedy, Abraham Lincoln and Jesus Christ have sold millions of copies and been turned into successful movies for the National Geographic channel. The latest adaptation, 'Killing Jesus,' is set to premiere on Palm Sunday. On Tuesday, Media Matters reported on a 2013 online post that questioned O'Reilly's claim that in 1977 he was outside the Florida home of George de Mohrenschildt, a friend of Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, when he killed himself with a shotgun. De Mohrenschildt had been contacted by congressional investigators looking into the assassination. O'Reilly's claim that he was there was in his book 'Killing Kennedy.' Media Matters quoted police reports, media accounts, former colleagues and other sources that dispute O'Reilly's claim that he was there. At the time, O'Reilly was a reporter for a Dallas television station. Henry Holt and Co. 'fully stand behind Bill O'Reilly and his best-seller 'Killing Kennedy,' and we're very proud to count him as one of our most important authors,' spokesperson Pat Eisemann said. Bill O'Reilly while reporting in El Salvador for CBS News in 1982. He claimed to have seen 'nuns being gunned down' - but it appears the event he was referencing took place a year before he arrived in the country . Fox News issued a statement reiterating its 'staunch support' for O'Reilly and said it would not respond to the individual accusations. Also this week, the publisher of O'Reilly's best-selling 'The O'Reilly Factor' defended the book, which refers to his disputed coverage of the Falklands War. The magazine Mother Jones said that O'Reilly claimed to be in a 'war zone' in Argentina when instead he was at a demonstration far from the front. David Drake, senior vice president and deputy publisher for the Crown Publishing Group, said that Crown would 'continue to publish our author's book just as he wrote it.' O'Reilly has faced questions on his books in the past. In 2011, one of the stores at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C., where Lincoln was assassinated, declined to sell 'Killing Lincoln' because of historical errors. Those included giving the wrong year the theater was destroyed by fire and referring to the Oval Office in the White House when it had not been built. Media Matters posted another story Wednesday questioning an O'Reilly statement that he had witnessed the execution of four nuns during El Salvador's civil war in 1980, based on a 2012 statement that O'Reilly made that 'I saw nuns get shot in the back of the head.' O'Reilly said Wednesday, however, that he had been shown pictures of the aftermath of the shooting while he was in El Salvador. He said his 2012 statement, during a discussion of the nature of evil after the Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting massacre, was a reference to seeing those pictures, not the shooting itself. O'Reilly was defended — sort of — by longtime nemesis Jon Stewart on Comedy Central's 'The Daily Show' on Monday. Stewart has suggested the media should be spending more time looking at the actions of politicians than media figures like Brian Williams and O'Reilly. Stewart noted the reporting on O'Reilly's past work at the same time his Fox show, 'The O'Reilly Factor,' is sending a staffer to look at all the snow in Boston and question global warming — reporting more worthy of scrutiny. 'Why don't we just agree that a certain amount of anecdotes from our media figures are seasoned with (expletive) and let's move on,' Stewart said.","Allegations came days after questions over O'Reilly's claim that in 1977 he witnessed the suicide of a friend of JFK shooter Lee Harvey Oswald .

While the audience at London’s 02 arena were able to take in the full performance, viewers at home were unable to hear most of the track as ITV attempted to mute the explicit lyrics. The 'Audio Muted' sign in the corner of the screen signalled that ITV bosses were ordering the sound to be turned off. An ITV spokesperson told MailOnline: 'ITV took the decision to use an audio mute during the performance. The Brits is broadcast live on ITV from 8pm to a wide audience. 'We have operated a short time delay as standard practice for some years on the show, to allow us to mute language that may be inappropriate for that wide audience, and elected to do so in this case, given the performance took place shortly after the 9pm watershed.'

His autumn/winter 2015 collection has barely left the catwalk at London Fashion Week and its already proven a huge hit with fashionista A-listers, with Taylor Swift and now Kim Kardashian both wearing designs from Julien Macdonald’s fall line. Unlike many of the latest collections embracing wide-leg styles and loose-fitting dresses, celebs have proved that the bodycon and skintight fit is yet to reach a demise with Julien Macdonald’s form-fitting collection already impressing the stars. After Taylor wowed at the Elle Style Awards in a deep green satin gown, Kim thought she’d try her hand at wearing the British designer and sport a one-piece cut out jumpsuit which clung to her famously voluptuous frame. Reminiscent of Mark Fast’s previous collections, this stringy lace-like jumpsuit flattered Kim’s hourglass figure and created a slimline silhouette – much to our surprise seeing as legging-style jumpsuits can often look unflattering. Additionally, we’re impressed that Kim is still risk-taking and shocking  us when it comes to her style, and we hope the nude co-ordinates are behind her for good now she’s worn this edgy fashion-forward one piece. As you’ve probably assumed, this jumpsuit is not available to buy just yet, but you can take inspiration from Kim’s red carpet style and check out our favourite black lace jumpsuits in the edit below from Nasty Gal, Anthropologie, Asos and more.

"A bus driver knocked down and fatally injured a 74-year-old pedestrian when he made ‘an error of judgement’ that could have been influenced by a green driving bonus scheme. Great-grandmother Sheila Bowling was crossing the road pulling a shopping trolley and was only a step away from the pavement when hit by the bus driven by David Cameron, 59. The single-decker bus was doing no more than 14mph and Cameron had time to brake or swerve to miss Mrs Bowling, but failed to do either, Sheffield Crown Court heard yesterday. Great-grandmother Sheila Bowling was crossing the road pulling a shopping trolley and was only a step away from the pavement when hit by  First Bus driver David Cameron (file picture) Cameron told police his employer First Bus gave weekly cash prizes – a £50 top prize and five £30 runner-up prizes – to the ‘greenest drivers’. Drivers are evaluated by a computerised system which uses dashboard ‘traffic lights’ to encourage smooth driving. The system is supposed to improve safety and save money through fuel efficiency. Red and amber lights flash in front of the driver when inefficient manoeuvres such as sharp braking or jerking the steering wheel are performed. A green light indicates ‘low risk’ driving. The accident happened in Sheffield city centre in November 2013. Mrs Bowling suffered serious head injuries and died four days later. Cameron, of Gleadless, Sheffield, admitted causing death by careless driving. He was given a 12-month community order, 100 hours’ unpaid work and banned from driving for a year. He has also been sacked. Cameron, of Gleadless, Sheffield, admitted causing death by careless driving at Sheffield Crown Court (pictured) and was given a 12-month community order, 100 hours’ unpaid work and banned from driving for a year. He has also been sacked . Judge Robert Moore said: ‘The system his company employs encourages gradual acceleration and deceleration and resistance as far as possible from turning the steering wheel fiercely. ‘It may have been possible had he used greater steering to avoid the lady who was in the last two metres of crossing this road. There was a clear error of judgement in that respect.’ The judge gave no opinion on what role, if any, the US-designed Drive Green system may have played in the tragedy. A First Bus spokesman said customer safety was a ‘priority’.","Sheila Bowling, 74, was crossing the road with shopping when  hit by a bus .

"Facebook has rolled out a new system to try and identify and help users having suicidal thoughts. It allows concerned friends  to report content for review. After reviewing a report and confirming that it may indicate suicidal feelings in a user, Facebook will send that user notifications stating that a friend has attempted to help and offering access to suicide prevention resources. The San Francisco social network's new system allows concerned friends to to report content for review, and Facebook can then offer the user more help. The tools build on a reporting feature implemented in 2011, which passed details to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in the US, and the Samaritans in the UK. 'Keeping you safe is our most important responsibility on Facebook,' said Rob Boyle of Facebook. 'Today, at our fifth Compassion Research Day, we announced updated tools that provide more resources, advice and support to people who may be struggling with suicidal thoughts and their concerned friends and family members.' The firm said it had worked with mental health organizations Forefront, Now Matters Now, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, Save.org and others on the updates, and consulted with people who had lived experience with self-injury or suicide. 'One of the first things these organizations discussed with us was how much connecting with people who care can help those in distress. 'If someone on Facebook sees a direct threat of suicide, we ask that they contact their local emergency services immediately. 'We also ask them to report any troubling content to us.' Facebook has set up teams working around the world, 24/7, who review any report that comes in. They prioritize the most serious reports, like self-injury, and send help and resources to those in distress. The firm said it had worked with mental health organizations Forefront, Now Matters Now, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, Save.org and others on the updates, and consulted with people who had lived experience with self-injury or suicide. For those who may need help we have significantly expanded the support and resources that are available to them the next time they log on to Facebook after we review a report of something they’ve posted. Besides encouraging them to connect with a mental health expert at the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, we now also give them the option of reaching out to a friend, and provide tips and advice on how they can work through these feelings. All of these resources were created in conjunction with our clinical and academic partners. We’re also providing new resources and support to the person who flagged the troubling post, including options for them to call or message their distressed friend letting them know they care, or reaching out to another friend or a trained professional at a suicide hotline for support.","New system allows concerned friends to report content for review .
Facebook will send user notifications stating that a friend is worried .
Will offer access to suicide prevention resources .

"A university student has warned against using unregistered taxis after she fell victim to a predatory cab driver who sexually assaulted. Lily Wright, 22, from Birmingham, has waived her right to anonymity to share her terrifying ordeal and urge other women not to take unlicensed cabs. Lily and her friend Jamielee Smalldon had flagged down a taxi, driven by Mohammed Iqbal, a father of three, following a night out in their home city. University student Lily Wright, 22, from Birmingham, pictured on a night out, was attacked by a taxi driver . But after dropping 21-year-old Jamielee at her house, Iqbal drove Lily to a secluded woodland and sexually assaulted her. He then drove her home – after he ordered her to pay him £50 for the journey. Lily said the encounter left her 'paralysed with fear'. She said: 'After what he'd just done to me, I couldn't believe he had the nerve to charge me. 'I knew it should only cost around £20 and I didn't have the money but I was desperate to get home. So I told him I did. 'As soon as I saw my house I didn't wait for him to stop, I opened the car door and fled. I was running for my life.' Lily, who attends university in Birmingham, recounted how she met Jamielee for a night out in March 2012. After a couple of drinks, the pair took a taxi to a club. Taxi driver Mohammed Iqbal drove Lily to a remote location where he sexually assaulted her . But when they reached the queue, she felt tired so the pair decided to get a cab home. 'I dived in the back while Jamielee sat in the front,' she said. 'As we drove off I rummaged in my bag, I couldn't find my phone anywhere, I'd lost it. 'Jamielee was calm and said the driver could call to let her know when I got home.' Jamielee was dropped off at her house first. Lily recalled: 'By the time we reached Jamielee's house I was nodding off. 'To make sure I was okay she gave the driver her number and asked him to call her when I had safely arrived home. She thought she was looking out for me. 'Jamielee said goodbye then I moved to the front passenger seat so I could give the driver directions to my house.' But Iqbal drove away in the wrong direction. Lily said: 'Five minutes on, we were on a pitch black, quiet, country road. The driver stopped the car, and phoned Jamielee telling her I was home safely. But looking out the window I could see only trees. 'Confused and scared, I sat in silence, no idea why we'd stopped. All I could do was panic.' Iqbal got out of the car and walked around the front. Opening her door he bent down and grabbed her trousers. Lily, left, is now warning other women not to take unregistered taxis following her ordeal after she and her friend Jamielee Smalldon, right, had flagged down a taxi driven by Mohammed Iqbal . She said: 'He began to tug on them, but I held them tight, trying to pull them up. 'Before, I'd been so tired, I couldn't wait to collapse into bed. Now I was wide awake, frantically fighting back. 'I begged him to take me home. I was crying and squirming around in my seat.' Despite her struggles, the driver performed a sex act on her. She said: 'I was paralysed with fear. It was disgusting and the whole time I was convinced he was going to kill me. 'I just thought he's going to rape me. I had tears streaming down my face crying stop. After what seemed an eternity, he stopped and released me from his grip. 'I was hysterical and asked him what he was going to do to me. He smirked back at me, making my stomach lurch. I was locked in the car. Then he got back into the front seat.' Lily begged Iqbal to take her home but the brazen sex attacker told her it would cost her £50. She said: 'I told him I'd pay anything. I was just praying that he would actually take me home and not continue that abuse.' They reached the house and Lily pushed open the door when he stopped the car and ran to her house. She banged on the front door and her dad Tom Wright, 56, found his terrified daughter on the front step. Lily said: 'I collapsed into the living room, blaming my lost phone for the reason I was hysterical.' Her sister Elizabeth, 18, also came downstairs, to see what the noise was about and Lily confessed she had been attacked. 'Elizabeth was shocked but helped me stay calm and we called police. I was exhausted, but I knew I had to remember as much as I could to help them,' Lily said. The 22-year-old is glad her attacker is now behind bars as Iqbal was jailed in October 2012 . 'They asked me to change out my jeans and top, and bag them up as evidence. I had to give them my underwear so they could examine it. 'It was so humiliating. The whole process took nearly ten hours. I was so traumatised I almost backed out. 'After the tests I went home. I had a bath, desperate to scrub away the previous night. 'But I knew I had to get this driver off the road or another girl would be his next victim.' Seven days later Lily received a call with news from the police. She says: 'They told me they had traced Iqbal, using CCTV footage, and found my phone in his car.' At Guildford Crown Court in September 2012, Iqbal, then 34, of Reigate, Surrey, pleaded not guilty to two sex attacks – one on Lily and one on another woman in his taxi. Lily said: 'Taking the stand was horrible. I didn't look at Iqbal but I wanted him to look at me.' On the last day of the five day trial, Miss Wright received another call from the police. She said: 'Some DNA evidence had been retrieved from the first victim's underwear. 'The next day police revealed the court had presented the evidence, and my attacker had changed his plea to guilty to two counts of sexual assault and one count of kidnap. I was so relieved I wouldn't have to return to court.' He was jailed for five and a half years in October 2012. Lily said: 'I couldn't believe he was a serial offender and wondered how many other girls he planned on attacking. 'I believe women should trust taxi drivers, and take a taxi rather than walking home alone at night. 'But they should book a registered taxi rather than waving one down in the street. You're putting your safety in their hands. And I learnt my lesson the hard way.'","Lily Wright, 22, from Birmingham, has waived her right to anonymity .

"Electronic cigarettes have been aggressively promoted as aids to help people on their way to quitting smoking for good. But the preliminary findings of a new major U.S. government study, published on Thursday, into tobacco trends has found that many smokers use the vaporizers to supplement their nicotine habit not to quit. Dr. Andrew Hyland of the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York, who is leading the investigation, suggests that some people simply use the devices as a 'crutch' so they can get a nicotine hits  indoors. The preliminary findings of a new major U.S. government study into tobacco trends has found that many smokers use electronic cigarettes to supplement their nicotine habit not to quit . His findings were drawn from a pool of 20,000 participants. A fraction - 28 per cent of adults and nearly nine per cent of youths - reported they currently use any type of tobacco product. About 40 per cent of those current tobacco users report using two or more products. And half say battery-powered e-cigarettes are one of the multiple products they use. In fact, the most common combination was cigarettes and e-cigarettes. Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, said the early findings showing use of more than one type of tobacco product are compelling and underscore 'how popular e-cigarettes have become.' Ultimately, the PATH study - it stands for Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health - will follow 46,000 people ages 12 and older over five years. It will serve as a source of information as the FDA decides how to regulate tobacco-related products. Policymakers are debating the health effects of 'vaping' as it grows in popularity. Many anti-smoking advocates consider e-cigarettes a safer alternative for smokers who can't or don't want to quit altogether. E-cigarettes work by heating liquid nicotine into an inhalable vapor. They contain fewer toxic substances than burning traditional cigarettes. But health officials warn that they shouldn't be considered harmless and say much more needs to be known about long-term effects. Critics ask if they keep smokers addicted or even act as a gateway to hook new users who eventually try tobacco. Concern about e-cigarettes grew after a different government study in December found some teens who'd never smoked a real cigarette were trying out the electronic kind. 'Is it a passing fancy or something that sticks with them?' Dr. Wilson Compton, deputy director of NIH's National Institute on Drug Abuse, said in an interview with The Associated Press. He hopes that over the next few years, the new PATH study will help tell. The FDA has proposed regulating e-cigarettes, including banning sales to minors, a step that many states already have taken. No one knows if experimenting with e-cigarettes poses as much risk of hooking someone as experimenting with regular cigarettes, Compton said. Nicotine levels vary widely by type of e-cigarette, from small amounts to nearly as much as a traditional cigarette, he said. Users learn to puff a bit differently as they draw in vapor, and even the voltage in the device's wires may affect nicotine delivery, he explained. NIDA plans to fund development of what Compton calls a ""standard e-cigarette"" that will be a yardstick for comparison with the different e-cigarettes on the market.","Dr. Andrew Hyland of the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in New York suggests that some people simply use the devices as a 'crutch'

"The U.S. economy took a dramatic tumble last fall as retail sales declined and and foreign imports increased. The Commerce Department revealed on Friday that the gross domestic product (GDP) - one of the primary indicators used to gauge the health of a country's economy - shrank by more than half in the 2014 fourth quarter to just 2.2 per cent. It marked a major slowdown from the third quarter's robust 5.0 percent pace, which had been the strongest growth in 11 years. Economists, however, remain optimistic that the deceleration was temporary. The Commerce Department said gross domestic product grew 2.2 percent between October to December last year - It marked a major slowdown from the third quarter's robust 5.0 percent pace (seen above, right) Many forecast that growth will rise above 3 per cent in 2015, which would give the country the strongest economic growth in a decade. They say the job market has healed enough to generate strong consumer spending going forward. The economy is 'doing just fine,' said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, who noted that although GDP growth slowed in the fourth quarter, the U.S. added an average of 284,000 new jobs from October through December. For all of 2014, the economy expanded 2.4 percent, up slightly from 2.2 percent growth in 2013. Consumer spending, which accounts for 70 per cent of economic activity, was a bright spot in the fourth quarter. It expanded at an annual rate of 4.2 per cent, down slightly from the first estimate of 4.3 percent growth but still the best showing since the first quarter of 2006. Friday's report was the second of three estimates for fourth quarter GDP, the broadest measure of the economy's total output of goods and services. Economists, however, remain optimistic that the deceleration was temporary . Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said that 'while the economy ended the year with less momentum than in the summer and fall, average annual growth of 2.9 percent in the past six quarters still denotes a meaningful upward shift from 2.1 percent in the first four years of the recovery.' The downward revision stemmed largely from slower stockpiling by businesses. Last month, the rise in inventories was estimated to have added 0.8 percentage points to fourth quarter growth. But that was lowered to a contribution of just 0.1 percentage point in the new estimate. The change, however, will likely translate into stronger growth in the current quarter because businesses will not have to work down an overhang of unsold goods. Trade also weighed more heavily on growth than first thought, subtracting 1.2 percentage points as imports grew much more strongly than first thought. That could be a reflection of the rising value of the dollar, which makes imported products cheaper for U.S. consumers. Many analysts believe 2015 will start slowly, in part reflecting the disruptions caused by a rough winter. However, it's unlikely to be as bad as the first quarter of 2014, when heavy snow and cold contributed to a 2.1 percent plunge in growth in the first quarter of 2014. That big drop was followed by sizzling growth rates of 4.6 percent in the second quarter and 5 percent in the third quarter. Analysts are looking for less of a roller-coaster ride this year. JPMorgan economists say growth will come in around 2.5 percent in the current quarter and then hover between 2.5 percent to 3 percent for the rest of the year. They are forecasting growth of 3.1 percent for the entire year, a significant improvement from the 2.4 percent growth seen in 2014. If the forecast proves accurate, it would be the best GDP performance since the economy grew by 3.3 percent in 2005, two years before the beginning of worst economic downturn the country has experienced since the 1930s. The U.S. economy took a dramatic tumble last fall as retail sales declined and and foreign imports increased . Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisers, is even more optimistic. He's forecasting economic growth of 3.5 percent this year. Naroff and other economists believe the key to the economy shifting into a higher gear will be further improvements in the labor market, when stronger job gains leading to rising wage gains. 'I see 2015 as a really good year for consumer spending because of the wage gains,' Naroff said. Even though the recession ended nearly six years ago, wage growth has been weak as businesses were able to pay less with so many unemployed looking for jobs. Several large companies have already signaled a willingness to pay more to retain workers. Retailers like TJX and The Gap, as well as the health insurer Aetna. News last week that Wal-Mart, the nation's largest private employer, would also increase its minimum pay could be a sign that a tighter labor market are finally leading to increased wages, some analysts believe. The unemployment has fallen to 5.7 percent. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, testifying to Congress this week, listed stronger wage growth as one of the elements the central bank is looking for before deciding to start raising interest rates. She said as long as wage gains remained weak and inflation low, the Fed was prepared to remain 'patient' in moving to raise rates. Many private economists believe the Fed's first move to increase its key rate, which has been near a record low of zero for six years, will not come until June at the earliest.","The Commerce Department said Friday that gross domestic product grew 2.2 percent between October to December last year .

"The father of a top law professor who was shot dead at his home has spoken for the first time at his family's 'frustration' that his son's killer has yet to be caught. It is almost eight months since Dan Markel was gunned down in an execution style killing as he sat in his car in the garage of his home in Florida. The 41-year-old father of two young sons, who worked at Florida State University, was shot in the head. There was no sign of a struggle and nothing was taken from his home with police quickly saying he was the 'intended target'. Scroll down for video . Out of the blue: Florida State University law professor Dan Markel was talking on his phone when he was shot in the head last July. He leaves two young sons . But despite an extensive police investigation into the murder last July by a team of detectives in Tallahassee, Florida, no suspect has been arrested. There has been no hint of a breakthrough in the murder that shocked his many colleagues at Florida State University and in the wider legal world. Detectives appear to have few leads to follow up on leading family members of Markel fearing his unexplained death will become a cold case. In his first public comments on the murder Markel's father Phillip expressed fears the case will never be solved. 'I know nothing will bring our son back but we would like some closure,' said Phillip Markel in an exclusive interview with Daily Mail Online. 'The investigation seems to have stalled and it is just so frustrating for the family. We want to see the killer caught and brought to justice.' Mr Markel, who lives in Toronto, Canada, said he has his own theories about who killed his son but said without firm evidence he is not willing to share them. 'It is frustrating as we are at a standstill and that means we cannot have closure and just have to live with it. That is not the best situation. 'I have my own theory who killed Dan, but I do not have the proof and am unwilling to share them.' Some colleagues had speculated that a posting Markel wrote on his now defunct blog PrawfsBlawg.could have somehow been the key to him being targeted. Markel was the subject of an anonymous threatening post. 'Bullies like this need to be made radioactive,' a person wrote about Markel's comments. 'Their arrogance and imperiousness speaks for itself. All means necessary must be employed.' Police have not said if the person who made the post has been traced. Markel, who was also educated at Cambridge University in the United Kingdom, was also on the receiving end of a series of strange messages. Several months before his death he began receiving unsolicited Facebook friend requests. Markel wrote: 'Is anyone else getting pestered just in the last week or so by obviously ridiculous or malevolent friend requests on fb from people with sham profiles all over the world w no possible connection to you? 'It feels like an onslaught of the Facebook equivalent of Cialis and Nigerian prince scams.' One friend jokingly replied, 'It might just be all your friends creating alter egos on Ambien.?' Other friends soon put his mind at rest when they too said they had received the requests. One female friend wrote that she had received four such requests. Markel was on a cell phone call while driving his Honda Accord back home. After pulling the car into the garage, he was followed in by an assailant who fired one shot at Markel's head through the car window, then left . Markel was alive when cops arrived, with the keys in the ignition of his car, before being pronounced dead at the hospital hours later, police said. Markel was apparently on the phone at the time of the shooting, remarking to the person on the phone that someone was in the driveway . Getaway car?  The 72-year-old man who called 911 after hearing gunshots said that he saw a Toyota Prius driving away . Close friends of the popular law professor have expressed their anger that the suspect remains at large. Many have taken to blogs in an attempt to keep people talking about Markel as they search for answers to the killing. Markel, a former Harvard Law  school graduate, was sitting in the driver's seat of his car talking on the phone when he was killed on the morning of July 18th 2014. Local police quickly ruled out robbery as a motive and said he was the 'intended victim'. At the time he was involved in a contentious divorce with his wife Wendi Adelson who had wanted to return to Miami, Florida, following the breakup of their nine-year marriage. The law professor obtained a court order preventing Wendi, who also worked at FSU, from leaving the city with their two children. Wendi, 35, has since moved to south Florida and has cooperated fully with the police. Soon after her husband's murder she quit her job at the University as a professor and left the city. She is believed to be living near her parents Harvey and Donna in Coral Gables, Miami. Her lawyer Jimmy Judkins said she had cooperated fully with police. He said she was in fear of her life and would not be making any comment until the investigation was resolved. He said:'Ms. Adelson requests that the media respect her privacy as she helps her children overcome the unexpected loss of their father. She remains deeply concerned about the safety and well-being of her children. 'During the ongoing investigation of this tragedy, Ms. Adelson will not be making any further public comments. 'She, and every person acting for her, will decline any further requests for information, interviews, or appearances. She encourages anyone who may have information that could help identify the person or persons responsible to please contact the Tallahassee Police Department.' The only real clue to the killer came from a neighbor of the Markels who heard a gunshot and saw a silver Toyota Prius leaving the scene. Split: Dan Markel and his wife Wendi Adelson in happier times. Adelson wanted to leave Tallahassee following the breakup of their nine-year marriage. The law professor obtained a court order preventing Wendi, who also worked at FSU, from leaving the city with their two children . Police have refused to say if the car has been traced. When contacted by Daily Mail Online to discuss the investigation a police spokesman said they had no comment and a spokesman did not return calls. Colleagues of Professor Markel have been left baffled by his murder. His close friend and fellow FSU professor Mark Spottswood is among those who fears the killer might never be caught. 'The heart is hungry for closure, but you keep reminding yourself that the wrong story is worse than no story,' Spottswood told the Tallahassee Democrat. 'It's just a tragic situation. I'm increasingly not optimistic that we're not going to have an answer.' He added: 'He wasn't the sort of person who would make the kind of enemies who would do something this violent and horrific . 'There's always the disturbing possibility that a former student had some kind of mental breakdown, but I think most of the students regarded him highly. 'We're left with something random and horrific or something about his life his better friends didn't know about, or the former student who loses their mind,' he added. 'It's just a tragic situation.' Friends of Markel said, despite the bitter divorce and breakup of his family, he had moved on with his life. Wendi Adelson, 35, has since moved to south Florida and has cooperated fully with the police . He was reported to be seeing a new woman,although she has never been identified. New York University law professor Rick Hills told the Toronto Star that he last saw Markel when he came to stay in Manhattan two weeks before his death. Hills revealed that Markel was moving on in his life and was now happy in a new relationship with a woman after going through his divorce. 'He was rebuilding his life after a really, really difficult period,' Hills said. 'I was watching him as he was in my apartment Skyping his kids and saying goodnight on his cellphone,he was so happy.' In the day after Markel's death the anguish for the Markel family was made worse after it was revealed a mix up by the emergency dispatchers led to paramedics taking over 15 minutes to reach the professor. The caller said:'You need to send an ambulance in a hurry He's still alive, he's still moving.' Markel died the following day and an internal investigation revealed that his shooting had been wrongly prioritized. The uncertainty over Markel's death adds to the pain and grief of his parents Phillip and Ruth. They have remained in contact with his ex-wife and speak to their grandchildren, Benjamin, five and Lincoln,four. Mr Markel remains optimistic police can crack the case. 'Of course I am hopeful that the police will find the person who killed my son,' he said. 'Murder is such a serious crime, particularly in Florida where there is the death penalty. The person who did this wanted to harm my son, of that I am sure.' Mr Markel said he keeps in contact with Tallahassee Police who update him on any new information they obtain as part of the investigation.","Dan Markel was shot in the head in an execution style killing while in his car in the garage of his Tallahassee home .

"Prince William has revealed that he would have liked to have been an astronaut as he helped launch a new business initiative on his second day in Japan. William's busy second day also saw him meet Japan's Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko, as well as take part in a ceremony at the Hodogaya Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery. His comments on space travel came during a traditional sake bottle breaking ceremony, conducted with the help of astronauts Tim Peak and Kimiya Yui in Roppongi. Going native: William obligingly donned a red Happi robe for his role in the sake barrel breaking ceremony . Suits you sir: William looked surprisingly at ease in the colourful crimson ensemble . Boost for Britain: In Roppongi, William helped launch the Innovation is GREAT campaign . 'When I was younger, I dreamed of being an astronaut, but I also wanted to be a policeman or a fire-breather,' said the Prince, adding: 'That might have been a bit alternative.' But with his mind now firmly on Earthly goings on, not least the imminent arrival of his second child, William confessed that he has since changed his mind. Asked whether he would still like to go into space, he quipped: 'I don’t think my Eurocopter will make it that far up. It seems like an awfully long way from the ground.' William followed that up with a speech, during which he said sorry for not bringing Kate and George, but added: 'I know that she looks forward to visiting Japan in the future.' The afternoon speech came after a morning spent visiting the Hodogaya Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery in Yokohama - precisely twenty years after his mother visited. Tribute: The Duke of Cambridge laid a wreath of chrysanthemums during his visit to Hodogaya . Like mother, like son: William was visiting exactly 20 years after his mother Princess Diana . Once inside the cemetery, William, who was wearing his Golden and Diamond Jubilee medals, laid a wreath at the end of a two minutes silence and after the Last Post had been sounded by a bugler. The floral tribute of chrysanthemums included a note written and signed by the Duke, which said: 'May we never forget all those who paid the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom.' More than 1,500 soldiers, sailors and airmen, many of them British prisoners of war, are buried at the tranquil cemetery, which is a short drive from central Tokyo. Their plots are marked by simple name plates and grouped by nations including sites for Australian, Indian, New Zealand and Canadian forces. Memories: Princess Diana, seen here at the Hodogaya Cemetery, visited Japan in 1995 . Snap: The scene at the cemetery today recalled the moment Princess Diana visited 20 years ago . Diana Fever: The Princess' visit sparked chaotic scenes as Japan fell, en masse, for her charms . Popular: The crowds also turned out for her son, who was welcomed by hundreds as he arrived yesterday . Welcome: Princess Diana, like her son, also met Emperor Akihito and is seen here at a state dinner . After Singapore fell in 1942, prisoners were transferred to a camp in Ofuna, near Yokohama, and sent to work in mines, factories and dockyards. When Allied forces began bombing Japan as the war drew to an end, many prisoners were killed during naval bombardments and air raids. Speaking after the Duke had laid his wreath, Captain Charles Ashcroft, the UK's defence attaché in Japan, gave a short speech. 'First we must remember the terrible losses that all our countries have suffered and pay tribute to those that have paid the ultimate sacrifice,' he said. 'We are here to pay our respects to the fallen and the wounded in all the conflicts across the world. 'We are now living in very different times, the Commonwealth and Allies stand side by side with Japan in remembrance. 'Today together we can pay tribute to the Japanese troops currently serving in peace keeping operations with the United Nations and in counter piracy operations with the multi-national coalition.' After the ceremony, the Duke walked among the graves with Capt Ashcroft, as well as the US defence attaché Captain James O'Leary and Major Isamu Suzuki, representing Japan. Then came another personally poignant moment, with William asked to sign a visitors' book placed beside a framed photo of his mother. Paying his respects: William chatted to some of the local staff who maintain the cemetery during his visit . Poignant: At the end of his visit, William was asked to sign a visitors' book placed beside a photo of Diana . Taking a moment: He stopped to look at the photo and read the caption inscribed on it . Signing: He then added his name to the visitor's book before travelling back to Tokyo . Happy memories: The frame contained a photo of the Princess during her 1995 visit to Hodogaya . Tranquil: The 1,500 British and Commonwealth soldiers at Hodogaya occupy a particularly peaceful spot . Japan boasts the oldest continual hereditary monarchy in the world, beginning with Emperor Jimmu who reigned from 660 BC. Since then, 125 emperors have come and gone, with the most recent, Hirohito, famous for being head of state during the Second World War. Unlike other members of the Japanese administration, he was not charged with war crimes and instead oversaw Japan's rebirth as a constitutional monarchy - a process continued by his son, Akihito. The picture, which showed Princess Diana laying a wreath at the same cemetery in 1995, was captioned: 'May she rest in peace'. Diana's 1995 visit to Japan had sparked chaotic scenes, with the country succumbing en-masse to her charms, sparking what commentators later described as 'Diana fever'. Her son, who is adored in Japan in part because of his mother, found himself at the centre of similarly sized crowds yesterday. Explaining the Duke's appeal, one well-wisher, Akane Ebihara, said: 'He is cool and handsome. And very tall!' That height became even more apparent during his meeting with the diminutive Emperor Akihito today, with 6ft 2"" William courteously inclining his head as he was introduced to the Japanese head of state. With the Emperor at the Gosho, the Japanese Imperial residence, was Empress Michiko and Crown Prince Naruhito. The Duke, who referred to Emperor Akhito as 'Your Majesty', recalled their last meeting in 2012, saying: 'Your Majesty, it's very nice to see you again. Thank you for having me here - fantastic.' William, who also enjoyed a warm welcome from Crown Prince Naruhito, was also introduced to Crown Princess Masako, who is rarely seen in public. His busy second day ended with a reception at the British Embassy in Tokyo, where, along with dignitaries, he was introduced to a Mongolian-born sumo wrestler named Yokozuna Harumafuji. Big meeting: Prince William bows his head as he is introduced to Japan's Emperor Akihito . Warm welcome: William was also introduced to 80-year-old Empress Michiko .

"The world has received its first glimpse of a gigantic airplane that will serve as an airborne launch pad for putting satellites - and eventually people - into orbit. The aircraft, which has a wingspan of 385 feet (117 metres) and will be powered by six 747-class engines, is currently being assembled at Mojave, California. Dubbed the Roc, the megaplane is the brainchild Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who is creating it under start-up firm Stratolaunch Systems. Scroll down for video . The world has received its first glimpse of a gigantic airplane that will serve as an airborne launch pad for putting satellites - and eventually people - into orbit. Picture is its twin fuselage sections under assembly . The plane will climb to 30,000 feet and launch a rocket at high altitude, avoiding the huge fuel costs of launching from Earth. This will then go into orbit as normal and deliver a satellite. Initially, the system is intended to deliver satellites weighing up to about 13,500lbs (6,124 kg) into orbits between 112 miles and 1,243 miles (180 km and 2000 km) above Earth. Rare stills taken from footage shot for a recent news story by KGET 17, a Bakersfield TV station, show its huge size, according to a report by Guy Norris in Aviation Week. The images show one of the two twin fuselage sections under assembly.

The plane will climb to 30,000 feet and launch a rocket at high altitude, avoiding the huge fuel costs of launching from Earth. In the news report, Scaled Composites president Kevin Mickey says the company has so far built 'roughly 200,000lbs of composite structure' for the vehicle. A debut test flight is expected in about a year with launch operations beginning in 2018. Instead of a satellite, the Stratolaunch airplane could launch a Dream Chaser spaceship, which would be outfitted with an as-yet-unspecified upper-stage rocket motor. 'Dream Chaser seemed to be the logical way to go,' Stratolaunch Executive Director Charles Beames said in October. In November, Sierra Nevada Corporation confirmed that it was working with Stratolaunch Systems to launch a the scaled-down version of Dream Chaser launched into orbit.

The Roc's 385 feet (117 metres) wingspan compares to 320 feet for the Hughes H-4 Hercules and 225 feet for the Boeing 747-8. Each of the twin fuselages of the Roc is 238 feet long and, when complete, will be supported by 12 main landing gear wheels and two nose gear wheels. Stratolaunch has produced computer-generated images and videos of the Roc, but the TV footage is the first time images of the real vehicle  have been shown. Allen has previously said his Rock project would 'keep America at the forefront of space exploration and give a new generation of children something to dream about'. Wingspan: 385 feet (117 metres) Engines: Six 747-class engines . Fuselage length: 238 feet (72 metres) Weight: 1,200,000 lb (544,311 kg) Maximum speed: 460 knots, 530 mph (850 km/h) Maiden launch: Flight testing will begin in 2016. The first launch of the space launch vehicle is likely to take place in 2018.

"A breastfeeding mother has spoken of her fury at being asked to cover up in a restaurant while she was trying to feed her three-month-old daughter. Ellie Hiscox was celebrating her birthday at a pizza restaurant in Manchester, which she deliberately chose because she had previously breastfed there without any complaints. But when she asked a waiter if she was allowed to feed her baby daughter Jocelyn at the table, he said she had to cover up. The employee told Ms Hiscox that customers had previously complained about breastfeeding mothers - but a manager later apologised to her, and said that she should have been allowed to feed her daughter freely. Anger: Ellie Hiscox was told she could not breastfeed daughter Jocelyn in a restaurant without covering up . The issue of breastfeeding in public has become a controversial topic recently after a mother was ordered to cover herself while nursing her baby in top London hotel Claridge's. Ms Hiscox, 30, went with her mother and daughter to Dough Pizza Kitchen, in Manchester's Northern Quarter, to mark her birthday earlier this month. Even though she breastfed Jocelyn during a previous visit, she decided out of politeness to check with a waiter that it was all right to do so again - but he said it was not. 'I always wondered what I would do if I was ever asked to cover my baby up to feed her, but I just stood there,' she said. 'I was so shocked, I just walked in and sat down, I didn't know what else to do. 'The waiter clearly did not think he had done anything wrong, he had no idea how awkward he made us feel. When we sat down I asked to speak to a manager but I think he thought I was joking. He did not bring a manager over. Restaurant: The incident took place at the Dough pizzeria in Manchester's Northern Quarter, pictured . 'I did try to feed her covered over slightly, but it was so difficult because she was grabbing the cover and I couldn't see her latch on properly. 'I have complained to the restaurant but even if they apologise and allow me to breastfeed I don't think I will return.' The restaurant's manager insisted that the premises does not have an anti-breastfeeding policy, saying that the waiter in question had made a mistake. Martin Connolly said: 'I would like to start by wholeheartedly apologising to Miss Hiscox for any offence or distress we have caused her. The company has never had a policy that requires women to cover up whilst breastfeeding. 'The member of staff in question has worked for the company for several months and I must take full responsibility for the fact that he had not been trained on the company policy regarding this issue. This has now been rectified and all staff are up to speed. Shock: Ms Hiscox, 30, chose the restaurant because she had previously breastfed there with no problem . 'I have strong personal views on the matter having two young daughters and a wife that regularly breastfed them both wherever and whenever required, and find the whole incident deeply regrettable.' In December, a national row began when nursing mother Louise Burns was told she had to drape a napkin over herself while feeding her baby in Claridge's. The controversy was fuelled by Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who said that mothers should 'sit in a corner' if they want to breastfeed in public. The NHS says that new mothers 'shouldn't ever be made to feel uncomfortable about breastfeeding in public', and advises them not to retreat to the toilets for nursing. It is illegal for businesses to ask women to leave while breastfeeding, under legislation brought in five years ago.","Ellie Hiscox went to a restaurant in Manchester with her daughter Jocelyn .

"Warrnambool is a country town which has one of the highest rates of child abuse in Australia, but the local council still dithers over whether to destroy a mural painted by convicted paedophile Rolf Harris, all in the name of art. Outspoken Councillor Peter Hulin has led the charge to have the earthy outback landscape removed but says he's being stonewalled. He says Monday is D-day for his colleagues to show where they really stand. 'It shouldn't be there any more, it's wrong on all levels, we should paint over it now and be done with it,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for videos . The controversial mural still in place on the loading dock wall of the Lighthouse Theatre in Warrnambool. The community is divided over whether it should be removed . The disgraced Australian entertainer Rolf Harris was stripped of his Australian honours after being found guilty of sexually assaulting four girls in Britain . The Rolf Harris mural is currently covered up by a dark perspex. He painted it during a performance at the Lighthouse Theatre in 1986. Critics say local government officials must make a decision to either remove the cover and leave the painting in place ore remove it from view altogether . Warrnambool City Councillors Peter Hulin (left) and Mayor Michael Neoh (right). Cllr Hulin is leading the charge to have the Rolf Harris mural at the local theatre destroyed. He and his colleagues will again debate the issue on Monday night, a matter which has bitterly divided the community for more almost eight months now. The mayor said 'I have no right to destroy someone's art' Warrnambool, is in Victoria's south-west, with a population of more than 33,000. It was gifted the mural back in 1986, when Harris painted it during a performance at the local Lighthouse Theatre. 'It sends the wrong message completely and anyone who argues that it's only in the loading dock area is wrong too, that's where kids get ready to perform,' he added. 'They are walking past it every day, we have to send the message that there is zero tolerance for this sort of crap.' He said many critics of the council have taken to blogs and websites calling it 'shameful'  and accusing officials of 'hiding behind perspex'. Daily Mail Australia has obtained a copy of the executive summary, to be reviewed by the seven councillors on Monday, March 2. Convicted Australian entertainer Rolf Harris, pictured here working on some of his instant murals, with the help of young volunteers, at the Ideal Home Exhibition, Earls Court . Rolf Harris arrives at Southwark Crown Court to face sentencing on 12 counts of indecent assault on July 4, 2014 in London. The 84 -year-old entertainer was found guilty of indecently assaulting four girls between 1968 and 1986, he was arrested in March 2013 by police officers working on Operation Yewtree . By their (council's) own admission: 'The rates of violence against women and children across Warrnambool are significantly higher than the Victorian state average.' And, according to the internal report, many in the community believe 'the art work of Rolf Harris not of significant value'. Against that, the council says the consultation after his conviction also found that 'it would set a bad precedent to destroy the artwork of an artist because his/her behaviour was deemed criminal'. Harris was jailed for five years and nine months last July for sex attacks on children as young as eight between 1968 and 1986, the same year he painted the mural at Warrnambool. The mural Rolf Harris (pictured leaving court) painted in the loading dock of Warrnambool's Lighthouse Theatre in 1986 is the subject of a bitter dispute in the Victorian town, many locals fear the local council will put the issue in the 'too hard basket' and leave the mural in place . Frank Penhalluraick, a Melbourne paint store owner, wasted no time making his feelings known. Here he is pictured painting over a Rolf Harris mural on his shop wall in protest against the disgraced entertainer . The three options the council have been given 'to explore' but not necessarily decide on Monday night are: . To destroy the mural, to leave it in place but covered and work on the prevention of violence against women and children and, thirdly, to leave it in place, covered, but with a plaque next to it to outline council's commitment to the prevention of violence against women and children. Councillor Hulin believes his preference to do away with the painting will not be supported. 'I think, maybe, two of us support it being destroyed,' he said. 'This is not censorship, like some bloke was claiming the other day, that it was like the Nazis burning books, that's just rubbish.' He was referring to claims by Adam Kempton, an art collector and a former Victorian member of parliament. But the disgraced entertainer's has already experienced a backlash against his work and achievements down under. Work he completed at a Melbourne paint store has already been removed, by owner Frank Penhalluraick. He has also been stripped of two major Australian honours in a decision gazetted by Governor-General Peter Cosgrove. 'It is notified that the Governor-General has terminated the appointments of Officer and Member of the Order of Australia in the General Division made to Mr Rolf Harris,' the notice from Mark Fraser, the Secretary of the Order of Australia, said. The news coming amid revelations that the convicted paedophile could be earning as much as $2500 a day from his prison cell thanks to his shrewd investments. The mayor of Warrnambool, Michael Neoh, told Daily Mail Australia that 'I have no right to destroy someone else's artwork'. 'It’s not like a traditional piece of artwork, on a canvas or something, so it’s not something that you can take down and store away like many galleries have done, not only in Australia but elsewhere,' Mayor Neoh added. 'The council officers have recommended that we maintain the status they’ve got a bit of perspex over it, that’s the recommendation, to keep it out of public view. 'My personal position is that Warrnambool City Council does a lot of work around violence against women and children and we’ve got a number of strategies in place, I don’t know that I have got the right to destroy anyone's art. 'We don’t condone what he did, we’ve come out very strongly and said we find it repulsive but I don’t have the right to destroy anyone’s art. The mayor believes the issue has been blown out of proportion. 'We’ve had it covered for 3 months, it’s been sensationalised by the media and at least one councillor has been very passionate about it,' he added. 'Some local artists have been asked about it and said it should go because it’s not a good piece of work, that’s not the criteria. 'And I don’t want to make light of this ... but someone said to me there were suggestions about Michael Jackson, does that mean that radio stations shouldn’t play Michael Jackson any more? 'Again, on the arts side I don’t think I have the right to deface or destroy someone’s piece of art.' One of his colleagues, however, is in no doubt. 'The painting has to go. We waited for the decision and whatever appeal process, enough already,' Cllr Hulin said.","Warrnambool has one of the country's highest rates of child abuse and violence against women .
