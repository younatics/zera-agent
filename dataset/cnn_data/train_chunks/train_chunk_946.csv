"By . Simon Jones . Atletico Madrid left-back Filipe Luis may have to pay cash himself to force his move to Chelsea.

"By . Ian Laybourn, Press Association . Bradford have appointed former player James Lowes as their new head coach. Lowes, 44, will leave his role as head coach of Leeds Carnegie rugby union team to succeed Francis Cummins, who was sacked just over a week ago by the relegation-threatened Super League club. The former Bradford and Great Britain hooker, who was in the Bulls team that were crowned Super League champions in 1997 and 2001 and did the double in 2003, was unveiled at a press conference at the Provident Stadium on Tuesday morning. Appointed: James Lowes has been hired as the new boss of Bradford Bulls . Bulls chairman Marc Green said: 'We are absolutely delighted to have someone of James’ calibre in place as our new head coach. 'As a board of directors, we recognise his talents, what he has achieved in the game, the names he has worked under and alongside in previous roles, and also what he achieved, last season, with Leeds Carnegie. 'Regardless of what division we play in next year, we believe James is the right man to drive this club forward and into a new era. 'We have been working extremely hard to ensure we have the right man for the job and are confident James can achieve great things here, both in the short term and in the long term.' Chief executive Robbie Hunter-Paul added: 'James fully understands the importance of nurturing stars of the future, he recognises the need for talent to filter through from the bottom up. 'In the short term, James is aiming to get the very best out of the squad and will begin work with our players right away. 'Going forward, he is committed to piecing together and developing a full performance department solution, while aiming to return this fantastic club to its former glories.'

The appointment will go down well with Bradford’s long-suffering fans after Lowes topped a poll in a local newspaper of supporters on who they wanted as the club’s next coach. He made 205 Super League appearances for the Bulls after joining them from Leeds in 1996 and in 2007 was named in Bradford’s team of the century. Lowes actually applied to become Bradford coach ahead of the 2011 season when Mick Potter was appointed as the successor to Steve McNamara. He was head coach of Warrington at the time but left shortly afterwards to return to Leeds, where he worked as assistant to Brian McDermott. Lowes was also England head coach under McNamara for the 2012 Four Nations Series but resigned 12 months ago to take up his role with the Rhinos’ sister rugby union club. Under Lowes, Carnegie reached the play-offs in successive seasons and he was under contract with them for next season.","Lowes appointed new coach of rugby league side Bradford Bulls .

"By . John Mcgarry . If his critics had had it all their way over the past couple of years, Ally McCoist’s role in life would have been more akin to Kindergarten Cop than that of the manager of Rangers. Each time the blue juggernaut has deviated from its path, the accusation invariably levelled at the man at the wheel is that his alleged aversion to blooding young players is the root of the problem. In McCoist’s view, there is only one small problem with that well-worn theory, however. That it has  absolutely no foundation in fact. Creating a pathway: Ally McCoist insists youngsters will be given a chance if they are good enough . The Rangers manager makes no apology whatsoever for welcoming 30-somethings Kenny Miller and Kris Boyd back into the fold. Nor does he blink an eyebrow at running the rule over former Hearts defender Marius Zaliukas in Brora over the coming days. Yet just because McCoist has turned to tried and tested operators in order to guide Rangers out of the Championship at the first time of asking, it doesn’t mean the manager has bolted the door on the Murray Park youth wing. Far from it, in fact. ‘We are not ignoring kids — it’s a nonsense to suggest otherwise,’ McCoist said. ‘You can’t flood your team with kids and then expect to get through two divisions like we’ve done. It wouldn’t have happened. ‘If we’d fielded a team of kids in the Third Division, we wouldn’t have won the league. It’s an unfair criticism levelled at the league. Familiar face: Marius Zaliukas is having a second trial at the club . ‘There has never been a case in recent Old Firm history where five or six kids have come through the ranks and into the first team. ‘Other than at Manchester United in the early 1990s, it hasn’t  happened anywhere. ‘But it doesn’t change my opinion. If the younger lads coming through are good enough — they will play. ‘Guys like Lewis Macleod and Fraser Aird have come in and they’ve stayed in. Others like Calum Gallagher and Robbie Crawford are there on the fringes. We’ ll continue, absolutely, to give the younger ones a chance.’ You don’t send a boy to do a man’s job, however, and in Boyd and Miller, McCoist has reunited the kind of strike force that will be required if the club are to cope with the obvious step up in quality from League One. Miller may be 34 but the desire to bulge nets up and down the land remains as strong as when he burst through as a teenager at Hibernian. Boyd, four years Miller’s junior, is almost unrecognisable from the player who — for all his exploits in front of goal — often seemed to be playing within himself in his first spell at Ibrox. Experienced: Kris Boyd is expected to spearhead Rangers' attack . ‘I’m really delighted with the signings so far,’ McCoist added. ‘I can understand people being  sceptical with players coming back and the ages of the players.‘But at the same time we are not in a position to plan longer term. ‘Finances are dictating that the job is to get out of the division until the time we can again spend money and bring players in. ‘I looked at the situation up front. A year ago, Kenny was scoring at Wembley for Scotland and Kris was unbelievable at Killie last season. ‘I was really impressed with their desire to come back, do well and be part of our journey. These guys are hungry. I was the same myself. When you are reaching 30, a fear goes through you that you are nearing the end of your career. ‘There is a desire and a  determination to look after yourself and play on as long as you can. Looking on: McCoist will cast an eye over his squad in Thursday night's friendly with Buckie Thistle . ‘Darren McGregor is another player I have always liked. He’s had a tough time of things of late through serious injury, but there has been an improvement in him. ‘He’s quick, strong and brave. He will continue his development with us.’ You wouldn’t bet against the former St Mirren man being paired with Zaliukas at the heart of Rangers’ defence by the time hostilities begin. McCoist tried to land the Lithuanian a year ago, only for him to move to Leeds, but leapt at the chance to assess him in person once it became clear the Elland Road club were prepared to cancel his contract. Yet, even if a deal can be thrashed out, McCoist hopes that won’t be the end of his business in this window. ‘I’m still looking,’ he said. ‘There’s still a bit of budget to play with. I definitely think we’ve strengthened. Recommendation: Former Leeds boss Brian McDermott has spoken highly of Zaliukas . ‘But we had to strengthen and we need to continue strengthening. I’ll certainly be looking to do that. ‘Big Marius has come up to train with us for a couple of days. Ismael Bouzid is also training back down the road. ‘We wanted to take him last year but he went down to Leeds. I’d imagine finance might have played a part in that, which is fair enough. ‘We watched a good few Leeds games last year and spoke with (former manager) Brian McDermott the other night. ‘If we can bring him in then great but there’s a lot of water to go under the bridge before that. ‘In an ideal world, we’ll hopefully get a defender in. But I’m looking everywhere. I’m looking for another midfield player within my budget.’ Getting back to it: Rangers captain Lee McCulloch in training this week . McCoist, who will have to do without Jon Daly for ‘a number of weeks’ due to the Irishman’s knee problem, gets the first look at his new side when they face Buckie Thistle on Thursday night. It is the first preparatory step for the Ibrox men as they face up to life in what is likely to be the country’s most competitive league. ‘Part of me still can’t believe Hibs are in the league as well,’ McCoist continued. ‘It’s just added to the whole interest. ‘A lot of people will have us down as favourites. I can understand that. Whereas the past two years, in the minds of many of the supporters and the media, it was a given. I don’t think there’s the same feeling about this season. ‘From our point of view, strange as it may sound, that’s a good thing.’","McCoist has been criticised for alleged aversion to blooding youngsters .

"By . Charlie Scott . Follow @@charliefscott . Mutiple major winner Tiger Woods is pain-free for the first time in two years but accepts he will never regain the game which saw him dominate golf for a decade. The 38-year-old won the last of his 14 major titles in 2008 but since then he has struggled with injuries and the very public breakdown of his marriage. His all-conquering spell between 1997 and 2008 saw him blow away rivals with a mixture of power and a single-mindedness not matched by his contemporaries. VIDEO Scroll down for Tiger Woods set to play in The Open Championship . Realistic: Woods has admitted that he will struggle to regain the form that saw him win 14 major titles . However, the current crop on the PGA Tour are now hitting it further and Woods accepts he has to find other ways to win as he prepares to make his comeback from back surgery on March 31. 'I feel old. The Chinese kid (Guan Tianlang) who qualified for the Masters last year (aged 14) was born after I won the tournament for the first time and that is just not cool,' the American told a press conference. Injury-plagued: Woods struggled at the Cadillac Championship in March, carding a final-round 78 . Off the pace: Woods' troublesome back was clearly bothering him during his last tournament appearance . 'That is what is coming: the next generation are taller, bigger and more physical - these kids in college, all the long-hitters are 6ft 2ins to 6ft 4ins. 'The difference as I have aged is I can't play the way I used to. Nightmare last round: The 38-year-old fired hit a final round of 78 at the Cadillac Championship . Trouble in the sand: The former World No 1 was not at his best at the event in Doral, Florida . VIDEO Woods announces return from injury . 'I was number two in driving distance for a number of years just behind (John) Daly - things have changed dramatically. 'I have to rely on different parts of my game like strategy and course management. 'The amount of shots I have learned over the years has allowed me to be as consistent as I have been over the course of my career. 'The old adage is with age comes wisdom and I have certainly become more patient, especially having two little ones has definitely taught me a lot of patience, and it has carried on the golf course. 'I remember all the early years on tour when I would run 30 miles a week and still go play tournament golf - and I was winning but not realising how much damage I was doing. 'Now I have to pick my spots when I can and cannot push. When I was younger I didn't need treatment. That is no longer the case. Focused: The American hopes to be back at full fitness for The Open at Hoylake next month . 'But I'm pain-free - it's been a very long time, probably a good two years since I've felt this way.' Woods is ahead of schedule for a playing return as he had initially targeted next month's Open Championship at Royal Liverpool, where he last lifted the Claret Jug in 2008. But after a carefully-managed programme of physiotherapy and dietary changes he feels ready to come back earlier - although he admits had this week's Quicken Loans National Tournament not been an event which benefited the Tiger Woods Foundation he would not be playing. The former world number one's injury problems began in 2008 when he had season-ending reconstructive surgery on the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee immediately after winning the US Open. All smiles: Woods will be making his first tournament appearance since he had back surgery in March . He has had further problems with that knee and an Achilles tendon but the back injury proved to be the worst of all. 'Pre-procedure, right before I went in, I wasn't able to function, I couldn't get out of bed, I couldn't do any normal activities,' he added. 'When I blew up my knee and even when I had Achilles problems I was still able to do things. 'Anyone who has had any kind of nerve impingement knows it is no joke but that part was relieved as soon as I got out of surgery. 'I felt I had my life back. I was able to do things, normal activities I took for granted.' Rehabilitation was a slow process, starting with putting before progressing to chipping, full swings right up to hitting a driver before finally getting back out on course for practice. 'I wanted to knock off some rush on the range so I didn't go out there and embarrass myself,' Woods said. 'I broke 10 for nine the first time - just like it was when I was three so I'm sneaking up on it.' While physically he may not be in the running to win this week mentally nothing has changed. 'It has been interesting road. This has been quite a tedious little process but one where I got to a point where I can play competitive golf again,' he said. 'Expectations don't change. That (to win) is the ultimate goal it is just that it is going to be harder this time. 'I've not had the amount of prep I would like but I am good enough to play and I am going to give it a go.'","The Amercan admits he will never regain form that saw him dominate golf .

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association Sport . Max Chilton is planning on an 'awesome' British Grand Prix weekend in a bid to raise his stock and profile further in Formula One. Of the three Britons on the grid at present, Chilton unsurprisingly remains the least well known in comparison to former world champions Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button. The 23-year-old has so far spent a season and a half in F1 learning his trade with back-of-the-grid team Marussia, although improvements have been made this year as the Banbury-based marque are nudging the midfield pack. Profile: British driver Max Chilton is hoping for an 'awesome' display at Silverstone . Back of the grid: The Marussia driver has been at the back of the pack for most of the season . This weekend's race at Silverstone at least offers Chilton the chance in front of his home crowd to prove he is not merely a driver that makes up the numbers. 'I love the circuit. Silverstone is old school, although it has been renovated quite a lot,' said Chilton. 'But you still have some really cool corners - Maggotts, Becketts are awesome. You'd never get bored of going through there flat in an F1 car. 'It's just an awesome home race, and not one of those where there are few spectators. It's one of the most watched of the year. 'You have all the campers, the helicopters coming in and out, and it's a really good buzz over the whole weekend. 'It's just a good fun weekend, and I'd like to think it will be a good one for us. 'Last year, around Silverstone, Caterham started to catch us up. They were probably a little stronger, but we managed to out-race them - just! 'So if we beat them last year when it wasn't a particularly great time for us, then as we're quite a way ahead of them at the moment we should have had a good weekend. 'But that was last year. I just hope we can carry that on into this year.' Aiming high: He is hoping to compete for attention with fellow Brit Lewis Hamilton . Hot couple: Jenson Button with his girlfriend Jessica Michibata at the recent Austrian Grand Prix . Fanatics: The pair are incredibly popular amongst fans of F1 . Chilton has finished 13th on two occasions, and also 14th this year, a reasonable return from the eight races to date. Whilst there is unlikely to be 'Max-mania' at Silverstone, Chilton at least feels he is now making his mark on the sport and becoming more recognised. 'My profile is something that's improved since I've been in F1,' added Chilton. 'Being on the parade laps I've seen the occasional Chilton flag, so that's gone up a bit more, which is nice. 'Definitely more people are aware. The longer you are in something the more they pick up on a name. It has built as you would expect.' 'Hopefully the Brits will be behind me this year. It's just a shame the Tour de France starts in Yorkshire this weekend. 'But it's two different sort of sports that shouldn't really affect the grand prix.' With mixed conditions expected at Silverstone again this weekend, that may yet play into Chilton's hands when it comes to a positive result. Chilton said: 'Results are determined by the attrition in a race. If there is no attrition we'll be happy with 17th, 18th. 'If there is high attrition, it rains, people have split strategies then you don't know. 'Qualifying is our usual target because it's one where we can plan, so if we can get into Q2 (the middle session of qualifying) then that would be awesome.'","Chilton hoping to match the profiles of fellow Brits Hamilton and Button .

"By . Simon Peach, Press Association . Wayne Rooney is relieved to at last be heading to a World Cup without any fitness worries. The Manchester United forward has flattered to deceive at major international tournaments since his remarkable breakthrough at Euro 2004. Then only 18, Rooney netted four goals, with his performances earning him a place in UEFA's team of the tournament and a move to Old Trafford. Pressure: Rooney (left) has failed to score a World Cup goal for England despite making the squad in 2006 and 2010 . Gutted: Rooney headed into his first World Cup in 2006 with an injury suffered for Manchester United . A decade on, he has yet to replicate that form for England and will be looking to amends at what will be his third World Cup this summer. Rooney had to rush back from a metatarsal injury to feature in 2006 and carried an ankle injury into the tournament in South Africa, although there are no mitigating circumstances this time around having come through England's 0-0 draw with Honduras in Miami. 'I am happy going to this final feeling fit,' Rooney said. 'I have played in every training session and I am excited. 'I am ready to play ready to enjoy it and hopefully ready to do well. 'I feel good and obviously playing against Ecuador (and the other matches) will have helped me as well after missing the games at the end of the season. 'I have trained hard feel good and am ready to play.' Dejected: Rooney trudges off the pitch after England's disappointing 0-0 draw with Honduras . Rooney, now 28, should be at the peak of his powers as an attacker, despite former Manchester United team-mate Paul Scholes suggesting otherwise. Those comments were laughed off by the forward, although he is aware of the importance of finally impressing on the world stage. If he is to impress, Rooney may well have to do it from an unfavoured role on the left flank. Five years ago he said the position restricted him in terms of expression, although he impressed when deployed there in Wednesday's 2-2 draw with Ecuador. Going for goal: Wayne Rooney (left) bends a free-kick towards goal during the first half . 'I have played there quite a lot in my career,' Rooney said. 'I have played left and right, more so on the left. 'The manager asked me to play there and I have no problem doing it. 'I am not going to stop playing for England because I was moved out on to the left wing am I? I am happy to play for England where I am needed.'","The Manchester United man has not performed well at a major tournament since Euro 2004 .

"By . David Kent . Luke Shaw told Southampton on the final day of the Premier League season that he wanted to join Manchester United. The 18-year-old left-back's transfer to Old Trafford has been delayed due to his selection by England for the World Cup but a £27million move should go through after the tournament in Brazil. Chelsea and Manchester City had hoped to hijack the deal but Shaw's mind was made up by May 11, according to the BBC. Shaw thing: England defender Luke is heading for Manchester United after the World Cup . Made his mind up: Shaw told Southampton of his intentions after the draw against United on May 11, the final day of the league season (above) Following Southampton's 1-1 draw with United on the final day of the season, Shaw told Saints bosses during a function at the team hotel of his intention to join the Red Devils this summer. His actions are not dissimilar to those of Pascal Chimbonda, who infuriated Wigan by handing then boss Paul Jewell a transfer request while leaving the pitch following the final game of the season in 2006. Shaw, however, has long been expected to leave Southampton this summer and join one of England's biggest clubs. Sportsmail broke the news that Shaw's move to United was all but a done on May 12. But Southampton are temporarily digging in their heels over the move. The club are reluctant to sell before a new manager has been put in place at St Mary's. Mauricio Pochettino left for Tottenham last month. Shaw had no choice but to put his move to United on hold until after the World Cup to concentrate on playing for England. Despite finishing seventh in the Premier League last season, United have always been confident that they have won the race for for Shaw. Shaw expects to get first-team football at Old Trafford and that clinched the deal. A powerful attacking asset, Shaw will replace France defender Patrice Evra. Getting acquainted: Shaw tackles United star Wayne Rooney during England training ahead of the World Cup . Shaw is a boyhood Chelsea fan, but has decided he wants to pursue his career at United, despite Jose Mourinho's decision to let Ashley Cole leave Stamford Bridge this summer, which has opened a gap in their squad at left-back. Shaw has already taken Cole's spot in the England squad for Brazil this summer, with Roy Hodgson opting to hand the youngster experience rather than take the man who won 107 international caps.

"By . Jeff Powell . Follow @@jeffpowell_Mail . Lionel Messi is the greatest player in the world, perhaps of all time, and after a few minor adjustments Argentina will be on their way to winning the World Cup. That is how life looks inside the self-deceptive bubble which this Messi band of brothers inhabit. Alejandro Sabella tells it thus: ‘Whatever Messi does or doesn’t do in this World Cup he is the greatest player in the world and one of the greatest in the history of football.’ VIDEO All Star XI: Lionel Messi . Moment of genius: Lionel Messi scores a superb goal to put Argentina 2-1 up against Bosnia and (below) Sportsmail's graphic of the strike . How Lionel lit up Maracana: Messi's goal against Bosnia . Rare moment of quality: Messi celebrates his goal but before that he had an absolute nightmare . But then Senor Sabella is the manager of Argentina. And without a Messi brimming with confidence his team would have no better than an outside chance of reaching the final on July 13. Messi the greatest player on the planet today? Well, you could say he was for the duration of the 10 seconds it took him to collect the ball, dance past an assortment of Bosnia-Herzegovina defenders and fire his exceptional goal in off a post. But for the 64 minutes which preceded that magical moment he had an absolute nightmare of a first game at Brazil 2014, running into opponents, losing the ball and looking up at the heavens as if trying to remind the almighty of his divine rights. True enough Messi did play better after scoring but in objective realty not like one of the gods of the game. The comparisons with his forefather Diego Maradona keep on coming but on this display they are an insult to the Argentine who once claimed that the Hand of God helped him beat England in one World Cup quarter-final. Great belief: Argentina's coach Alejandro Sabella (left) thinks Messi is one of the best players of all time . Pele, Alfredo di Stefano and Garrincha are among others entitled to feel slighted. This is not to deny that Messi is a terrific player and has the rare skills and intelligence to rise to the pantheon. But, as with any player blessed by birth to play for one of the major football powers, he needs his big World Cup to be anointed. Whether that will happen here remains as up in the air as the French players when they were launched skywards by the hackers from Honduras. Virtually all he did on Sunday night was emphasise how capable he is of scoring amazing goals. But in so doing he also reminded us that this is only his second in a World Cup. He is in his prime right now and if he does not conquer Brazil - outshining the likes of Neymar, Pirlo, Van Persie and Robben in the process – then the clock will be ticking all the louder. Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi's goalscoring records for Argentina . Maradona . 91 games, 34 goals (1977-94) Lionel Messi . 87 games, 39 goals (2005-) Messi will turn 27 the day before Argentina play Nigeria in their last group game. Given that they are in an apparently less demanding section, he and his team-mates will presumably be in the mood to celebrate after that match. How far they progress beyond that will depend not only on Sabella sorting out his tactics but whether they can bring their collective ego down to earth. They should have been punished by the Bosnians in a ragged, disorganised first half, although they did improve when Sabella sent on a couple of decent substitutes and reverted to an orthodox back four. Yet even in the closing stages, after Messi had put them two up, that old arrogance returned and they conceded one goal and almost threw the win away. Insult: There is still no comparison between Messi and World Cup winner Diego Maradona . Argentinian God: Maradona, deified in his homeland, scores that controversial goal against England in 1986 . Sabella admitted only: ‘Maybe we made one or two errors and I got one or two things wrong. But we will get better.’ Complacency is contagious in this camp but at least Messi did not appear too gravely affected when he observed: ‘Yes, we do have to improve.’ He can say that again. And he had better keep doing so if the tens of thousands of Argentines – some of whom managed to break into the Maracana without tickets on Sunday – are not to be disappointed.","Messi had a nightmare for 64 minutes against Bosnia-Herzegovina .

"By . Rajvir Rai . Follow @@R_Rai . Diego Costa is not used to being a substitute and the boredom of watching Spain cruise to victory against Australia clearly got to him. The striker started Spain's opening two World Cup group games against Holland and Chile but found himself on the bench for Monday's clash as Vicente Del Bosque rang the changes after two consecutive defeats. Next to him sat Xabi Alonso - who had come off with seven minutes of the game left to play. With the result beyond doubt and no prospect of getting on, Costa had an idea to keep himself entertained. The 25-year-old appeared to try to wax his team-mate's leg with what looked like tape. The prank barely registered with Alonso, who shot his team-mate a confused and unimpressed look and continued to enjoy the display his team-mates were putting on. Opener: David Villa's first-half goal set Spain on their way to an easy win . At the double: Chelsea striker Torres makes it 2-0 to Spain after the break . Clincher: Juan Mata sealed the win with a third goal late on . The bizarre moment draws to an end Spain's disastrous World Cup defence. The 3-0 win over Australia, courtesy of goals from David Villa, Fernando Torres and Juan Mata, was scant consolation for a team used to so success. For Costa the tournament has been a disappointing, with the striker failing to score. Although some mitigiation must be made for the fact he had just recovered from a leg injury. Alonso, meanwhile, is rumored to be on the brink of intentional retirement. If the 32-year-old does call it a day, then at least he won't have to put up with Costa's pranks anymore.","Costa was an unused substitute during the 3-0 win .

The Premier League is providing more World Cup quarter finalists than any other league in the world - showing England's top clubs are still some of the best when it comes to world class quality. But while English sides are proving to be the most collectively successful in Brazil so far, Bayern Munich - as they often do - are still top of the pile with 10 players left in the tournament. The German champions started the World Cup with more players than anyone else, and many of them are still in with the national team - which alone boasts seven Bayern stars - making it through to the quarter finals. Premier League's finest: Andre Schurrle and Mesut Ozil both scored for Germany in their last-16 tie .

Surprise package: Bryan Ruiz might have been out on loan but he's still England-based with Fulham . Blues brothers: Oscar and Ramires are among a host of Premier League players in Brazil's squad . Arsenal and Chelsea lead the way for the English, providing eight and seven players each - leaving them just behind the German champions. Both Manchester clubs, London rivals Tottenham and Alan Pardew's Newcastle all make it into the top 20 clubs too. Spain's World Cup flop appears to have cost their league giants Real Madrid and Barcelona places amongst the top ranking clubs - and if they had made it to this stage the traditional La Liga rivals could boast eight and nine participants respectively. Champions League finalists Atletico Madrid amazingly fail to make the list of the World Cup's top 20 clubs while La Liga registers as just the fifth best league in the world behind England, Germany, Italy and France. The figures fuel the long running argument over which country boasts the best league. While the Premier League has long sold itself as the best around, back-to-back all-German and all-Spanish Champions League finals have brought the claim into question. And the English clubs will undoubtedly be able to show off even more top talent after what looks to be a busy summer of transfer activity for the big clubs, although none of the players listed here will be keen to talk about that sort of thing with the focus still on international glory.

"By . Martha Cliff for MailOnline . When Sharon Fox was diagnosed with breast cancer her world fell apart. Grueling sessions of chemotherapy saw her size rocket from a slender 12-14 to an 18-20 and her body confidence hit an all time low. However, five years after her diagnosis, the 44-year-old is unrecognisable as she models for a lingerie campaign. Who needs Abbey Clancy? For Ultimo's latest underwear campaign Michelle Mone has chosen 15 real women to pose in the latest collection . Sharon from Tamworth, Staffordshire joins 14 other women in Ultimo's latest Real Women campaign. Michelle Mone, the woman behind the brand, says she wants the campaign to represent real women's bodies and hopes it will boost others' confidence. In an interview with Closer magazine, she said 'Body confidence is all about how you feel, not how you look. 'Since I started Ultimo, it’s always been my aim to boost women’s confidence. I feel it’s our duty to showcase women of all shapes and sizes and make them feel good about themselves.' For Sharon, the shoot did exactly that. She said that at the beginning of her treatment back in 2009 she couldn't have ever imagined feeling as comfortable in her own skin as she does today. 'Chemo was gruelling, I felt so weak and lost my hair. Another horrible side effect was the weight gain - the drugs I was taking made me put on 4st'. Sharon, pictured left in the Ultimo shoot, and right, as she underwent chemotherapy for breast cancer in 2009 . 'I felt so self-conscious – so much so that at times I’d refuse to even go out of the house.' If the hair loss and weight gain weren't enough to knock Sharon's confidence, operations that left her breasts disfigured left her feeling even more self-conscious. 'I had my left breast removed in November 2009, then my other breast removed a year later to prevent the cancer returning. 'I've since had five operations to reconstruct my breasts. At one point, they were different sizes and that really knocked my confidence.' Determined not to let her illness ruin her life, in January last year Sharon began exercising reguarly and changed her eating habits. Within nine months had returned to her normal size 14. 'I’m so proud of what I've achieved. I’m due to have another operation next month to have my nipples reconstructed and I know that’ll make me feel even more confident.' Sharon now feels confident enough to show off her body again - and the Ultimo campaign gave her the perfect opportunity. Sharon (far left) wants to prove to other cancer survivors that you can feel sexy again and Karen (on block) says that anyone can achieve the figure they desire, while Tracey (standing, second from left) until recently had struggled with her weight for the majority of her life . She explains: 'I never thought I’d have the guts to pose in my underwear - but I loved every minute of the shoot! I want to show women who've been through cancer they can survive and still feel feminine.' Sharon was recently given the all clear and says the biggest relief is that she can be there for her family. 'I've recently been given the all-clear from cancer, and I’m just happy to be healthy. Being here for my children is the most important thing to me.' Sharon is one of 15 women who have suffered body confidence issues who are now taking part in the reveal all campaign. Office manager Karen Charlton, 46, from Cambridgeshire, felt body-conscious after splitting with her husband in 2010 and was sure she would remain single forever. 'I felt daunted about meeting new men, and was conscious of my wobbly bits.' she told Closer. Karen began to gain weight after having giving birth to her children gaining two stone because she didn't have time to exercise. Karen was sick of feeling so self conscious and decided to shape up. Tracy, 47, from Tunbridge Wells, (pictured left in the Ultomi shoot, and right, befire she lost weight) had always struggled with her weight but lost 5st to transform her body – and life . 'I was unhappy with my flabby stomach and wanted to tone up. I knew exercise would give me the confidence I needed to get out there and meet people, so last year I started using a workout app. 'Within weeks, I saw results and friends even commented on how flat my stomach was.' Karen now stars along side Sharon in the Ultimo campaign. She says that she hopes her story will show other women that it is possible to get the figure you want. 'I’m a normal woman who’s been through a divorce and is raising two kids alone. If I can get in shape and feel good about myself, anyone can! I’m now seeing someone new and my confidence is growing. The Ultimo shoot made me realise just how far I've come.' The campaign sees many successful weight loss stories but Tracy Willmers' is perhaps one of the most impressive. Tracy Willmers, 47, from Tunbridge Wells, had always struggled with her weight but lost 5st to transform her body – and life. Tracy had struggled with her weight for the majority of her life with her starting to put on weight in her teenage years. Michelle Mone (centre) says: 'I've posed in my lingerie and can vouch for the fact it’s not an easy thing to do. But I want women to celebrate their bodies and if others can relate to the pictures and see how great they look, then we've done our job' My weight problems began at 13, when I’d eat comfort eat to cheer myself up. I carried on eating unhealthily throughout my teens and by 21, I weighed 15st and was a size 18. I could barely walk up the stairs without feeling breathless.' Tracy began to take a healthier approach when she hit 30 but she said that it was not an easy ride. 'The turning point came in my 30s when a friend encouraged me to join a gym and I started working out three times a week. 'It was hard – I felt self-conscious and just walking on the treadmill left me gasping.' Tracy's determination eventually saw her achieve amazing results which encouraged her to continue her healthy habits. 'I also overhauled my diet and within three months I’d lost a stone. That gave me the confidence to keep going and gradually I slimmed down until I reached a size 12 and 10st – a healthy weight for my 5ft 4 frame.' Michelle Mone, the woman behind the brand, says she wants the campaign to represent real  bodies and hopes it will boost women's confidence . Since her dramatic weight loss Tracy's attitude to health and fitness has completely changed and she now exercises regularly. 'I now work out three times a week and have even run a half marathon. My weight loss has left me with stretch marks, but I don’t care – I’m a real woman! 'I’m nearly 50 and in the best shape of my life. I loved showing off my body at the shoot.' Michelle Mone added that she hopes that these women's stories will help other women boost their self-confidence. 'It’s such an incredible feeling that the women get after the shoot, not to mention the confidence it gives them. 'I've posed in my lingerie and can vouch for the fact it’s not an easy thing to do. But I want women to celebrate their bodies and if others can relate to the pictures and see how great they look, then we've done our job.'

"By . Ben Spencer for the Daily Mail . Until now, the humble plant pot has stood the test of time. First used by the ancient Egyptians to nurture their seedlings, the basic pot has been hardly altered in millennia. But British innovators claim to have improved on that universal design - and their container is being enthusiastically used by some of the country’s leading horticulturists. Scroll down for video . The Air-Pot (pictured) is a plastic container, made from recycled bottles, and perforated with holes. Each undulating surface is shaped like an egg carton. As the roots grow, they travel towards the holes and when they reach fresh air, the tips are naturally pruned as they dry out . The Air-Pot is based on the simple idea that plant roots need aeration, a concept that can radically improve the health of flowers and boost yield of fruit and vegetables. The Air-Pot is a plastic container, made from recycled bottles, and perforated with holes. Each undulating surface is shaped like an egg carton. As the roots grow, they travel towards the holes and when they reach fresh air, the tips are naturally pruned as they dry out. This encourages fresh, vigorous and bushy growth elsewhere in the root system, increasing the plant’s uptake of water and nutrients. The design has been used by professional nurseries and gardens such as the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and Edinburgh for a decade. Sizes range from one litre up to 500 litres. The full range is only available to commercial growers, at a minimum order of £1,000 ($1,680). Online retailers sell the one-litre pot for £1.10 ($1.85). Packs of 10 and 14 litre pots are also available to amateur gardeners and a two pack costs £16 ($28) and £18 ($32) respectively. The plastic containers, which are made from recycled bottles, are perforated with dozens of holes and each undulating surface is shaped like an egg carton. In a traditional plant pot, the roots circle round and round the container, which can lead to the plant becoming ‘pot bound’. But the undulating surface of an Air-Pot directs the roots towards the holes. When the roots reach fresh air the tips are naturally pruned as they dry out, encouraging fresh, vigorous and bushy growth elsewhere in the root system, increasing the plant’s uptake of water and nutrients. The design has been used by professional nurseries and gardens such as the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and Edinburgh for a decade. But now the Scottish company which invented the Air-Pot, Caledonian Tree Company, is setting out to market the concept for amateur gardeners for the first time. When the roots reach fresh air, the tips are naturally pruned as they dry out, encouraging fresh, vigorous and bushy growth elsewhere in the root system. This increases the plant’s uptake of water and nutrients and results in larger plants and produce. A carrot grown in an Air-Pot is pictured . Julyan Rawlings, marketing director at the firm, said: ‘Roots aren’t designed to be contained, and in a normal plant container they will just circle round and round, they essentially become deformed. ‘In the Air-Pot the holes mean the roots are air-pruned, eliminating root circling. That encourages root growth, meaning healthier plants. ‘Until now this has mainly been used for trees, but it works equally well with chillies, peppers, tomatoes, melons, potatoes - pretty much any plant you can think of.’ Air-Pots are available at a number of online retailers, starting at £1.10 for a one-litre pot, and the company is planning to ramp up its marketing for gardeners next Spring.

But now the Scottish firm behind the design is setting out to market the concept for amateur gardeners for the first time . Tony Kirkham, head of arboretum at Kew Gardens, said: ‘We have been using these to grow most of our trees for some years now and they are excellent. ‘They really are the best invention since the flowerpot all those centuries ago. ‘The root system is the engine of the tree. If you buy a car you have a look under the bonnet to see what the engine is like and it’s exactly the same with a tree. ‘If a plant has a poor root system you are off to a bad start and it will never establish. ‘The root system needs oxygen as much as it needs moisture or nutrients and the Air-Pot provides that.’ The firm said that, until now, the pots have mainly been used for trees, (pictured) but added they work equally well with chillies, peppers, tomatoes, melons, potatoes .","The Air-Pot is based on the idea that plant roots need aeration .

"By . Emily Payne . Some of Greece's most celebrated beauties are getting a facelift. And after almost 2,500 years it's not surprising they're looking a little weather-beaten. The Caryatid statues, which until the late 1970s propped up a section of the Erechtheion Temple on the Acropolis, are being cleansed of grime inside the museum where they're now housed. The Caryatids: It will take about seven months to clean each of the larger than life-sized figurines . Iconic beauty: A view of the illuminated Acropolis above the old town of Athens . Restoration work is taking place in the Acropolis museum in Athens, surrounded by a white fabric screen to protect visitors from laser beams, which can cause permanent eye injury. Museum director Dimitris Pantermalis said . the main reason for cleaning the sculptures on the spot was to avoid . the potential hazards of moving them. One of the six Caryatids was removed by Lord Elgin in the 19th century and today stands in the British Museum. Makeover: Conservator Costas Vassiliadis uses a laser to clean a Caryatid at the Acropolis museum in Athens . The other five were removed from the . Erechtheion in 1979 to protect them from air pollution and acid rain, . and replaced by copies. But there's the additional value of offering tourists the spectacle of restoring some of the greatest glories of the ancient world. 'We want to offer visitors a backstage peek,' he said. Visitors are impressed: 'The fact that it was in situ, taking place in the museum, it does bring it home to you the actual level of care that is needed to bring these back to life,' said British tourist Trevor Richards, from Manchester. Planning began in 2011 and the restoration is expected to be completed this June . It takes about seven months to cleanse each of the larger than life-sized statues, which were carved around 420 B.C. Work began in 2011, and is expected to be finished in June. 'The process removes all of the pollution, the smoke and everything that has settled on the statues for more than a century, and leaves intact the patina, that orange hue that the statues took on with the passage of centuries,' Pantermalis said. Costas Vassiliadis cleans one of the striking statues which were created in 420 BC . 'It's done with very great care to avoid any possible damage.' The Erechtheion Temple was sacred to the gods Athena and Poseidon, and associated with the first kings of Athens. It later served as a church, a Frankish palace and a Turkish harem. Although Greece's oldest examples of pillars in the human form are a century older, the Caryatids are the most famous of their kind, and were widely imitated from Roman times to Europe's classical revival. Visitors admire the Caryatids as the operation, inside a white fabric box, is relayed on a monitor at the museum . The conservators are using laser technology developed specially for the Acropolis sculptures by the Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas in Crete. 'The laser beam hits the black crust formed on the surface of the statues over the years, and that absorbs energy and disintegrates,' said conservator Costas Vassiliadis, who heads the six-strong team. 'The crust has a much lower resistance threshold than the marble, which is not affected.'","The restoration process began at the Acropolis Museum in Athens in 2011 .

"By . Emily Payne . It seems some people will do anything for a freebie - and that includes blackmail. Restaurant, hotel and B&B owners across the UK have reported a huge rise in the number of customers who use TripAdvisor as a threat. Chancers are telling staff they will post bad comments on the review site if they don't get better service, meals or upgrades. Bad reviews: Guests are threatening hotel and restaurant owners for free meals and stays . Caterers say the scammers often make a complaint and say if they don't get a free bottle of wine or dessert or a bill reduction they'll post a bad review. Other 'gastronomic blackmailers' claim they even work for TripAdvisor and will post a series of negative comments unless they get free upgrades. Martin Couchman, deputy chief executive of the British Hospitality Association, said he is in talks with TripAdvisor to improve the service. He said: 'People threatening restaurants and hotels with bad TripAdvisor reviews to extort free things is a problem which has been growing. 'While it's very difficult to put an exact figure on how widespread the problem is, it is clear that small minority of online reviewers are directly blackmailing - or sometimes subtly blackmailing - restaurants for their own gain. Blackmailed: Craig Savage and partner Sarah Bird outside their restaurant, Double Barrel Bar and Grille, Rotherham . 'People will either attempt to blackmail during the meal, or sometimes, more worryingly, people who have not even been to the restaurant will post a bad review to try and get a free meal, or a free stay in a hotel's case. 'While it can be difficult to prove that somebody has blackmailed you, we would advise that business owners do not respond - or make free offers - to reviewers they suspect are malicious. 'Instead, take the matter to Trip Advisor, as they do work hard to keep malicious and inaccurate reviews off the site. And if you're still having problems - get in touch with us.' Steak house owner Craig Savage, 49, fears restaurateurs across the UK are being hit by people who are jeopardising business reputations to get a free lunch. The Double Barrel Bar and Grille, in Rotherham, where customers have threatened the owners with bad reviews . Craig claims around 30 meals out of the 1,000 he serves in his restaurant every week will be to malicious customers, who threaten bad reviews unless they get a freebie. Craig, who runs the Double Barrel Real Steakhouse and Grill in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, with partner Sarah Bird, 33, said: 'What usually happens is that a customer will come to the bar, or say to the waiting staff, ""I am a senior TripAdvisor reviewer"" and then you know that something will definitely go wrong.' Under normal circumstances, when a customer is not happy, Craig would offer to knock money off the bill, give them a free bottle of wine, or a dessert. 'But what we are finding is that these so called reviewers will complain about the meal or the service and when you ask how to put it right, you can guarantee it will be some sort of freebie,' said Craig. 'But that's all they're after - something for free, and it just isn't right. 'And it's not just our restaurant that's being affected, every restaurant owner I speak to is concerned about this phenomenon.' Another concern for the couple is people posting malicious reviews on to the website without even going to the restaurant. Craig said: 'To begin with, when somebody posted a really bad review about us on TripAdvisor we would reply back to them, apologise and offer them a free meal or something. 'But what we noticed was that some of the reviewers clearly had not even been to the restaurant and were just posting the review to blag a free meal out of us. 'One such reviewer went on about how the tables in the restaurant were really old on the week we had just had them replaced. 'TripAdvisor is essential to business owners because it's probably the first place people check to see if a restaurant's good or not. 'But these malicious customers know that - and they realise they can use it to their advantage.' A spokesman for TripAdvisor said: 'Allegations of blackmail or threatening behaviour by guests against property owners are taken very seriously. 'If an owner experiences this, we urge them to contact us immediately. We have a way for owners to proactively report threats before a corresponding review is submitted. 'Immediate reporting of blackmail threats, via our Management Centre, which every owner can register on for free, can help us keep blackmail reviews from ever reaching the site.'","Tourism bosses targeted by fraudsters demanding free meals and stays .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . An easyJet flight carrying TOWIE cast members and their luggage was grounded because it was too heavy to take off. The plane flying from Southend to Malaga, Spain, on Saturday was delayed after it was not allowed to take off due to carrying 200kgs of extra weight. Cast members Arg, Ricky Rayment, Lauren Pope, Grace Andrews, Fran Parman, Bobby Cole Norris and Jasmin Walia were all on board the flight, heading to Marbella for a 10-day trip being filmed for a summer special of the ITV2 series. Flying to Marbs: Bobby takes a photo of the crew on board the easyJet flight that was grounded on Saturday . Overweight: The TOWIE crew usually pack a lot of luggage. Dan Osbourne pictured arriving in Marbella . Extra luggage allowance? Danielle Armstrong and Dan Osbourne arriving in Spain to shoot the ITV2 series . The captain made an announcement to passengers, explaining that the flight was overweight and couldn't take off, asking for four people to leave the flight and transfer to Luton to catch another plane. He added they would be put into a taxi and given £100 each, and added: 'I'm not taking off unless people do it.' After 30 minutes, four women finally volunteered, with a flight attendant adding: 'In 20 years, we have never had an incident where this has happened before. Delayed: The easyJet flight was grounded at Southend airport . Travelling light... TOWIE cast members arriving in Las Vegas with their luggage last year . 'But then, we've never had TOWIE on board before.' Bobby Cole-Norris, told heat magazine: 'We were at Southend runway when the pilot came out of the cockpit - and when he does that you know there's something to worry about. 'He got on the walkie talkie to say 'we're 200kg over, four people have got to get off and be put in a cab to Luton, there's a flight tonight we'll give you £100 each but obviously no one dare do it so after about 20 minutes he was like ""I'm not taking off unless people do it"".' TOWIE's Jasmin Walia added: ""There was no way we were doing it for £100 it's such an inconvenience.' Jasmin reportedly packed three suitcases and Bobby was 4kg over with his luggage allowance - which he claimed was down to hairspray. A spokesman for easyJet said: 'Like all airlines, easyJet’s flights have weight restrictions based on a number of different variables for safety reasons. 'In the event that a flight does exceed its weight limit, we ask for passengers to volunteer to transfer to another flight which is what happened on this occasion. 'The safety and welfare of our passengers and crew is always easyJet’s highest priority.'","Cast members on board included Arg, Ricky Rayment, and Lauren Pope .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . We’ve all done it at some point – taken a wrong turn at a roundabout and ended up in entirely the wrong place. Or put too much faith in the car sat-nav, and found ourselves many miles from our planned destination, wondering how we could have been so stupid. Under investigation: VietJet Air managed to land at an airport 62 miles from its destination . But then, few of us are airline pilots flying in the competitive south-east Asian market. And few of us have done what the crew of a Vietnamese Airbus A320 did earlier this week – and landed at the wrong airport, over 60 miles from where we should have been. All staff who were on Flight VJ8861 – operated by budget carrier VietJet Air – have been suspended after the aircraft touched down at Cam Ranh airport, near Nha Trang City – a popular holiday resort on Vietnam’s east coast. The incident happened on 19 June, but the full story of what went wrong is yet to emerge. The plane was scheduled to land at Lien Khuong Airport, near Da Lat City, which sits a full 62 miles west of Nha Trang – and nowhere near the sea – in Vietnam’s Central Highlands. Here's where you went wrong: Jet landed in Nha Trang (B) when it should have been in Da Lat (A) The Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam (CAAV) has taken swift action against the flight crew, pending an investigation. The regulator says that its preliminary findings reveal a ‘serious incident… posing [a] threat to aviation safety.’ The CAAV also says that, according to its early research, crew, pilots and ground staff failed to follow proper procedures. It adds that ‘appropriate measures’ will be taken against the airline once the investigation is complete. Vietjet Air has not yet explained how the plane came to arrive at the wrong airport. The aircraft was carrying 180 passengers – all of whom had to be transferred on a second flight. It's good, but it's not right: Nha Trang is a popular holiday hotspot - but it was not the plane's destination . VietJet Air launched in 2011, and has thrived in the crowded skies over south-east Asia, taking 25 per cent of the Vietnamese domestic aviation market. Until this incident, it had an unblemished safety record – although it was reprimanded by the CAAV in 2012 for staging an on-board Hawaiian-themed dance, performed by beauty-pageant contestants, without clearing the event with the safety body.","Investigation underway as to how budget airline went so badly wrong .

"By . Bianca London for MailOnline . Lydia Rose Bright shot to fame on The Only Way Is Essex as Lauren Goodger’s sidekick with a penchant for peroxide blonde hair extensions, fake tan and micro pigs. But fast-forward three years and the 23-year-old says she has ditched her make-up bag - and is encouraging other women to do the same. Lydia Bright is working with St Ives to encourage young women to strip back their make-up, have the confidence to bare all and embrace their natural beauty. Scroll down for video . One image in the new St Ives campaign shows her with a week's worth of make-up on (left), while the other sees her with a super-natural, stripped-back face, a look she says she now loves (right) Lydia stars in a new shoot for the beauty brand which saw over 35 make-up products being applied to her face by three make-up artists using 30 brushes over the course of almost two hours to demonstrate what an average week's worth of make-up really looks like. She then removed all of her make-up to convey the difference between heavily made-up and fresh-faced. Before the shoot, Lydia used St. Ives facial scrubs three to four times a week, to ensure her skin was perfectly prepped and radiant. Obviously being from Essex, Lydia is well aware that she and her TOWIE co-stars are famed for their love of fake tan, false eyelashes and hair extensions. 'We are a glam bunch and image is a huge part of our lives and when the camera is rolling, we want to look as good as possible,' she told MailOnline. 'But all the cast loves nothing more than getting home and taking over their gel nails and make-up.' The shoot saw over 35 make-up products being applied to her face by three make-up artists using 30 brushes over the course of almost two hours to demonstrate what a week's worth of make-up really looks like . Lydia says she hopes to encourage other women to embrace a more natural look- and says men prefer it . Lydia says she tries to ditch the make-up four days a week, especially when she's running errands or attending meetings. She said: 'I am a total girly girl and when I'm filming TOWIE, I get glammed up but I actually try to go bare as much as possible when I'm not on camera,' she said. 'I hope that my involvement will encourage other women to follow my lead, wear less make-up and embrace their natural beauty. I want this to show women that you can look better without make-up.' Another reason Lydia believes that bare-faced is best is because men prefer it. 'James used to hate it when I wore red lipstick because we couldn't kiss. I think men like a girl who takes good care of herself and visits the salon weekly to get her nails done and has her hair done monthly. It's important to take pride in your appearance but men don't want a girl who masks herself in make-up, they want to take her home and not have their parents judging her.' The newly natural star says she admires Millie Mackintosh's look because, she says, the former Made In Chelsea star nails the natural look and always looks beautiful. The shoot saw Lydia stripped off an entire weeks worth of make-up by a team of make-up artists . Lydia's belief that men don't like women to mask themselves with make-up is supported by a study in which too much cosmetics was named as the top turn off by 45 per cent of men . Before the shoot, Lydia used St. Ives facial scrubs three to four times a week, to ensure her skin was prepped . Former look: Amy Childs, Lauren Goodger, Lydia Bright and Sam Faiers showcase very different looks back in 2011 to the ones they do today . 'She's probably got loads of products on but she always looks so flawless,' she said. The campaign is launched as a new study, commissioned by St Ives, reveals that two thirds of British women mistakenly think men prefer them to wear plenty of make-up. Half of women do their make-up almost 1,500 times a year - and two thirds go just three and a half weeks a year without wearing any slap, researchers found. Almost one in ten women admit they wear make-up solely to impress the opposite sex. But their cosmetics could well hinder their love lives as three quarters of men say they actually prefer girls who adopt a more natural look. And 39 per cent think most women wear too much make-up and would rather they tone down their usage, with 45 per cent citing too much slap as the biggest turn off. Aside from her duties with St. Ives, Lydia has been busy designing her SS15 fashion range and says she plans to expand into daywear, on top of her successful line of party dresses. And while she calls the bright lights of Loughton her home, Lydia's family actually hail from a tiny village in Italy. 'Me and my mum are off to Italy to see my relatives in my time off air. My ancestors were monks and my grandfather was the only one to leave the village ever so we are the only tourists who ever visit. 'I haven't been there for four years so they haven't seen me since I've joined TOWIE - they have no idea how much has changed!.'","Lydia, 23, stars in St. Ives latest campaign .

The study revealed that while 57 per cent of Brits remember to clear out the fridge, and 65 per cent check electricity sockets are switched off, only 33 remember to ensure flowers are looked after. A study of 2,000 Brits by www.thejoyofplants.co.uk revealed one in six (17 per cent) admit completely forgetting they even owned any plants. New service: Charlie Dimmock launches Houseplant Hotel for one week in the London area . Free service: Charlie's Houseplant Hotel will collect and look after houseplants while Londoners are on holiday . This leads 43 per cent of Brits to return and find them looking parched, dusty and wilted. Now these neglected leaves could be saved thanks to the very first Houseplant Hotel. Launched by thejoyofplants.co.uk and TV gardening expert Charlie Dimmock, the business provides a special babysitting service for houseplants - for free. For one week from July 4, staff will provide a collection service to holiday-bound owners in London, whisking their plants away to be looked after. It's part of a nationwide campaign to give forgotten ferns and stranded spider plants another chance at life. TV gardening expert Charlie Dimmock is launching the free service with thejoyofplants.co.uk . Gardening expert and author Charlie, 47, known as a presenter on BBC’s Groundforce, and has also appeared on Celebrity Masterchef, said: ‘It's so simple to keep your plants healthy, even while you're on holiday. ‘Hopefully the thought of a Houseplant Hotel will remind everyone out there to check on their plants before checking in to their holidays.’ Nearly half of forgetful plant owners (45 per cent) admit preferring to throw out a wilted plant than try to revive it - a habit that costs Brits an estimated £829m a year. It also means the average lifespan of a British houseplant stands at just seven months - when it could stretch for decades. Charlie added: ‘I'm aware some people find it hard to care for their plants but I was surprised to hear such a vast number of Brits give up on their plants so easily. ‘As a plant-lover, I can't ever imagine chucking out a plant that still has the potential to bring so much character and life to your home.’ The Houseplant Hotel runs for one week from July 4 for holiday bound Brits in the London area.","Gardening expert unveils free service in London for holidaymakers .

"By . Madlen Davies for MailOnline . Sticking to a diet is key to shedding the pounds as all branded weight loss plans reap similar results, researchers have found. Canadian scientists said the difference in weight loss between diets is so small that people should simply choose the diet they find the least challenging. Scientists at McMaster University in Ontario and the Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute in Toronto analysed 48 trials including data from 7,286 overweight dieters. They looked at dieters’ weight loss at six and 12 months, to see if there was any benefits to particular diets. After 12 months people on low carbohydrate and low diets lost similar amounts of weight, an average of 7.3kg . Eva Mendes (pictured left), who weighs a tiny 57kg follows the low fat South Beach diet, while Jennifer Aniston (pictured right) is a fan of the high protein Atkins diet . Jessica Simpson follows the Weight Watchers diet, but also went on a vegan diet in the two weeks running up to her wedding to Eric Johnson . The study, published in the Journal of American Medical Association, found that after 12 months, people on low carbohydrate and low fat diets lost a similar amount of weight, an average of 7.3kg. Those on low carbohydrate diets had lost slightly more weight at six months, but by 12 months the difference was obsolete. The researchers did find that diets with behavioural support and exercise enhance weight loss. At six months, diets with behavioural support enhanced weight loss by about 3kg, while exercise was significant at 12 months, improving weight loss by about 2kg. The study concluded: ‘Significant weight loss was observed with any low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet. Weight loss differences between individual named diets were small. ‘This supports the practice of recommending any diet that a patient will adhere to in order to lose weight.’ The range of diets covered included, Atkins, South Beach, Zone, Biggest Loser, Jenny Craig, Nutrisystem, Volumetrics, Weight Watchers, Ornish and Rosemary Conley.","Canadian researchers found any diet works if you stick to it .

"By . Catherine Eade . It is the bizarre new extreme sports craze that is sweeping Europe... enabling thrillseekers to fly underwater. Called 'Subwing', the unusual new adrenaline-fuelled activity involves diving underwater and gripping onto a 4ft carbon-fibre 'wing' that is dragged behind a speedboat. And now the world's first official Subwinging centre has been opened at the Peligoni Club on Zakynthos, Greece. A Subwing is a device with two wings that is towed along by a boat to enable a person to be pulled along underwater while twisting, turning and performing acrobatics . The adrenaline sport was invented by Norwegian teenager Simon Sivertsen who, bored on a family holiday, fashioned together a 'wing' from old banana boxes. Sivertsen, now 22, then tied the splintery device to the back of a yacht with 30 foot of rope and persuaded the driver to dag him forward. Seeing the vast potential for fun he soon refined the art - discovering that tilting the wing could easily control direction and depth underwater. With the help of some exciting You Tube videos the 'simple to manoeuvre' exploit soon became popular - earning Sivertsen a slew of design awards and manufacturing opportunities. You'll need to take a deep breath before you go down a few metres, but Subwing users can surface to take a few gulps of air when they like by pointing its wings in the direction in which they wish to travel . What if the key  to flying lies in the depths of the ocean? With a Subwing you can fly... like a penguin . Subwing is an incredible sport that has reinvented the way you can experience the ocean, where riders are towed behind a boat and have the ability to spin, turn and dive almost anywhere, says Director of Subwing, Mats Westgård. 'Riding the Subwing will make you feel like you’re flying underwater and gives the rider a sense of dolphin-like freedom,' he says . The Subwing is being launched during the Club's Beach the Blackberry young professionals fortnight. Defined as requiring 'little or no . training', and underlining the need to resurface to breathe 'whenever you like' the exciting new watersport has gained fans quickly. Beginners will typically spend between . 10 and 15 seconds underwater at a time, diving to around three metres - . but with more training and practice users can go much deeper and for . longer. The carbon wings' hollow design and foam . filling allows the Subwing to float when it is not being towed some 10 . to 12 metres behind a speed boat. Once they’re in motion, riders can steer the Subwing up and down, left and right, or perform spins by angling or twisting the wings. Sivertson, a Norwegian sailing fanatic discovered the new way to travel underwater with the agility and grace of a dolphin . The adrenaline sport was invented by Norwegian teenager Simon Sivertsen . The user . is pulled along at anything from two to four knots, (2.3mph to 4.6mph . with a scuba mask being the only other piece of gear required to create a . sense of underwater flying. A deep breath is required but Subwing users . can surface for breath when they like and manoeuvre the device by . pointing its wings in the direction in which they wish to travel. Because of the way the ropes are attached . to the wings, a force balance between the user and the tow ropes is . created, which reduces the energy required to operate the device and . allows divers to hold their breath for longer, the company says. A Facebook page has even been set up exhorting people to try the sport and comparing it to the flight of the penguin. 'Have you ever dreamed of flying? You are not alone... but what if the key lies in the unexplored and deep substance that is covering most of the earth’s surface, water. 'A species that has learned to harness the water’s abilities in a way nature originally didn’t intended is the penguin. It left the sky in favor of the ocean, unlocking the great potential of underwater flight. 'This potential has never been harvested by humans, until now…Introducing the SUBWING, human underwater flight with virtually full freedom of movement is now made possible. So grab your SUBWING and go fly. Underwater,' the site urges. Sivertsen says the Peligoni club was chosen as the location for the Subwing centre as 'The water . is ridiculously clear and the mountains there shelter the coast from the . waves.' The Subwing consists of two separate wings connected in a rotatable swivel.By grabbing the grip on each wing, it can easily be controlled in all directions.Users can tilt both wings downwards to dive, and upwards to resurface, while if attempting a roll, a person twists the wings in opposite directions.The company says that controlling the Subwing is easy to learn and comes naturally to many first- timers. Water is about 800 times denser than air and therefore high speeds are not necessary to achieve what feels like a fast speed under water. The company recommends a towing speed around 2-4 knots, (2.3mph to 4.6mph) which can be achieved by a boat with a small motor .

"By . Stephanie Linning for MailOnline . TV host Scott Rogers was 'shot dead' by Matthew Hodgkinson, his son-in-law and former lover, in a 'murder and attempted suicide' on Wednesday at his home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana . A British dance teacher who who was accused of molesting a pupil and running a 'cult'-like school is believed to have been shot dead in his US home by his son-in-law - who was also his former lover. It is thought Scott Rogers, 52, was killed by Mathew Hodgkinson in a 'murder and attempted suicide' in his home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Wednesday, according to local police. Mr Hodgkinson, 36, was married to Mr Rogers' daughter Kimmy, and it has been suggested that all three lived in the home where Mr Rogers was shot. Mr Rogers, originally from Suffolk, was well-known in the city as the host of his own weekend show on a local television channel. He founded the Academy of Dancing and Performing Arts in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk in 1983. He was known as Richard Scott-Rogers in the UK. The school was likened to a 'religious cult' by Suffolk County . Council bosses, who in 1995 warned parents of the 'perceived risk' of sending . children to the school. On Thursday two men alleged that Mr Rogers sexually abused them as young boys - one said he was a former pupil of the dance academy. Police said that Mr Hodgkinson survived the 'murder and attempted suicide' and is now in a coma in Our Lady of the Lake Hospital, Baton Rouge. Iberville Parish Sheriff Brett Stassi, investigating the shooting, said the home had been the scene of a 'bunch of stress' in the past several weeks. He said: 'It looked like a murder and failed attempted suicide. Scott was shot in his bed, under the covers, tucked neatly in. 'It looks like Mathew put the gun to his own head... he was seriously wounded but still alive. He's still in a critical condition in an induced coma. It's been topsy-turvy at this residence. 'We responded to a couple of calls. It's been a high stress environment for this family and looks like it culminated in this.' Mr Stassi said his deputy found a note next to the bed. He said: 'We think Mathew wrote it and maybe even put it there after Scott was deceased.' On Thursday two men, appearing anonymously on a Louisiana radio show, alleged that Scott Rogers sexually abused them as young boys.

In 1995, Suffolk County Council voiced concerns about 'a senior member' of the academy following a High Court case in 1993. In a statement released at the time, the council warned parents of an 'unhealthy atmosphere' at the academy and compared it to that of 'a religious or supposedly religious cult' . Police said that Mr Hodgkinson survived the 'murder and attempted suicide' and that he is now in a coma in Our Lady of the Lake Hospital, Baton Rouge, pictured. It is understood he lived with Mr Rogers . It said: 'There was also considerable anxiety felt as to levels of intimacy that existed between the senior member and pupils.' At the time headteacher Rachel Richards denied the claims of 'cul-style brainwashing classes', she said: 'We are just a school teaching the performing arts. Some of our pupils have moved on to appear in the West End theatre and on television. 'People are still coming here for classes from all over Suffolk.

"By . Alan Hall . A beloved hippopotamus called Maikel died an agonising death in a zoo in Germany after a visitor threw a tennis ball into his enclosure that he mistook for an apple. Maikel, 39, wolfed the ball down only to die four days later with his bowel blocked up. Zoo staff said he was in acute agony before his death and had no clue as to what he was suffering from. Hippo  Maikel died at Frankfurt zoo after a visitor threw a tennis ball into his enclosure and it blocked his bowel . He was voted the favourite animal in the zoo by visitors last year and delighted children especially with his gentle nature and graceful swimming. 'He was in the best of health and we were frankly baffled,' said Professor Manfred Niekisch, director of Frankfurt Zoo. 'Our vets did their best for him but it was hard to understand what a 2000 kg animal was suffering from. 'His immense bulk meant an ultrasound was out of the question. There was no way of us to find the tennis ball in him, let alone remove it.' A full autopsy found that a tennis ball had lodged in the hippo's intestine, leaving him in intense pain . He collasped and died in the water of his enclosure last Thursday morning, and his lifelong partner Petra was seen swimming repeatedly over his body and trying to nudge him to get up. Because the zoo was concerned for the health of the other hippos a full autopsy was ordered on Maikel at the Hessian State Pathology Laboratory - usually reserved for human victims of crime. Pathologist Dr Anne Nesseler led the autopsy on Friday and the tennis ball blocking his bowel was discovered. 'He died a very painful death,'she said. 'It was an immensely stupid and immensley cruel thing to do, feed a tennis ball to an animal like this.' A special animal crime squad has been charged by Frankfurt police to find and prosecute his killer under animal protection laws. Virgine Wegner, a spokeswoman for the force, said: 'The enquiry is continuing.'","Hippo Maikel died at Frankfurt Zoo after a visitor threw a tennis ball at him .

"By . Hugo Duncan . A British woman who moved to France to follow her dream of becoming a winemaker has spoken of her anguish after vandals poured £60,000 of her product down the drain. Katie Jones, who left Leicestershire two decades ago, lost the equivalent of 4,000 bottles of white wine – an entire year’s vintage. The 47-year-old said it was her ‘worst nightmare’ to discover she had lost a year’s work when she returned home after a business trip. Target: Katie Jones has lost the equivalent of 4,000 bottles of white wine in a 'vandalism attack' on her vineyard in Languedoc . She told the Mail: ‘It was a real shock, it was absolutely awful. It is really difficult to explain. For a winemaker it is the worst nightmare. ‘It is absolutely devastating. It is horrible. Wine is unique. That vintage was unique. It can never be made again. I will never taste it again.’ Miss Jones said she did not believe she had been targeted because she is British. But she hinted that her nationality may have been a factor in the attack in a comment to a well-wisher on social networking site Twitter. She said: ‘Yes it is quite unbelievable! One of the inconveniences of living in small french village.’ Miss Jones made the discovery on March 31 on her return from a wine fair in Germany – just before April Fool’s Day. Vandalised: Katie, originally from Leicestershire, believes she may have been targeted by local criminals because she is British . ‘I would have loved it to be an April Fool,’ she said. But instead it was a devastating setback to her business in just her fourth year of winemaking. ‘It is really difficult to deal with when you are starting a business, creating an image, and attracting customers,’ she said. The vandals emptied two tanks of her award winning Grenache Gris at the winery in Tuchan in the Languedoc mountains – destroying the entire supply of white wine. The wine, sold under her Domaine Jones brand through the Wine Society, was worth £15 a bottle. Wine critic Jancis Robinson said it was another case of the ‘increasingly common phenomenon’ of ‘wine vandalism’. Saving grace: Internet wine retailer Naked Wines, raised cash from its customers to help Katie make the 2013 vintage of her white wine . But Miss Jones hopes to bounce back after an internet wine retailer came to the rescue. Naked Wines, set up by entrepreneur Rowan Gormley, has promised to stump up cash raised by its customers to help make the 2013 vintage.

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . McBusted star Harry Judd has today urged people to be more aware of their hearts after he was diagnosed with an irregular beat while training for a marathon. The drummer first noticed something was wrong two weeks before he was due to line up for the start of the Virgin London Marathon last April. The Strictly Come Dancing 2011 champion said it was only at his wife Izzy's behest that he went to see his doctor. Tests revealed Harry had an ectopic heart beat -  where the heart produces an extra beat. McBusted star Harry Judd was diagnosed with an ectopic heart beat two weeks before he was due to run the Virgin London Marathon last April . The drummer, pictured with his bandmates, was cleared to take part in the marathon by his doctor, who told Harry the condition is common in athletes . Despite his diagnosis, Harry went on to complete the marathon, crossing the finish line in three-and-a-half hours, and has since seen signs of the condition disappear. But he urged people to be aware of their heart health, encouraging those exercising to use a new heart rate monitor that sits on a person's wrist like a watch. He told MailOnline: 'I was doing the marathon last year and I was training way too hard, as it turned out. 'I was also interval training as well, I just thought if I was going to do it, I would do it properly, especially given I was asking people to sponsor me. 'So I really went for it.' But two weeks before the marathon, Harry said he noticed what felt like a twitch in his chest. 'The first time I noticed something was wrong, I felt something like a twitch, in my peck muscle. I remember thinking it was really weird,' he said. 'It then started to feel like my heart was fluttering, too quickly. 'But I didn't want to say anything to worry people.' After finally telling his wife, Izzy, the McBusted star said she 'totally freaked out', urging him to visit the doctors. It was after he was referred to see a heart specialist that he was diagnosed with the condition. 'Eventually I did say something to my wife, who totally freaked out, understandably,' he told MailOnline. The Strictly Come Dancing 2011 champion today urged people to be more aware of their heart health, as he gave his backing to a new wrist heart monitor, pictured left and right, made by Epson . Harry told MailOnline: 'The first time I noticed something was wrong, I felt something like a twitch, in my peck muscle. I remember thinking it was really weird' Not wanting to worry anyone the McBusted drummer said he waited a few weeks before telling his wife Izzy, pictured. It was at her behest that the star went to see his doctor . 'I went to see a heart specialist who basically performed a series of tests on me, while I was wearing a pacemaker. 'It was then I was diagnosed with an ectopic heart beat. It is quite a common condition among athletes. 'It was kind of scary at first. It is hard to explain. When you become very fit and healthy your resting heart beat is very low therefore it can become too low. 'While it was a scary diagnosis, we were reassured. My doctor told me I was ok to run the marathon.' After crossing the finish line in three-and-a-half hours, and calming his rigorous running regime, Harry said he noticed the condition disappeared. 'I am absolutely fine now, when I stopped the marathon the fluttering feeling just disappeared,' he told MailOnline. 'My doctor said that should be the case, once I stopped training so hard. And thankfully there have been no repercussions. 'I have been warned that I am likely to be prone to the condition, but now I will be more aware and keep an eye on it. 'It has made me more aware of how hard I pushed myself, and how I pushed it to the extreme.' Epson has today announced it is launching a new series of products aimed at runners. Harry told MailOnline the new technology would've been a 'godsend' when he was suffering his heart condition. While there are a number of similar products available, Harry said the Pulsense product combines readings 24 hours a day. It measures calories burned, sleep quality and exercise across five heart rate zones as well as recommending daily goals to help towards weight loss targets. Harry said: 'I am absolutely fine now, when I stopped the marathon the fluttering feeling just disappeared... Staying fit and healthy is not just about exercise, it's a lifestyle thing' 'Heart rate monitors are traditionally worn around the chest and are a bit of a pain,' he said. 'But this new product is amazing, it is worn as a wrist watch and you don't have to wear anything else. 'I could've really done with it when I was training. 'Staying fit and healthy is not just about exercise, it's a lifestyle thing. 'The monitor can tell when your heart rate is elevated and records it even when you're not moving. 'It takes readings 24 hours a day, even when you are sleeping. 'It is really interesting, not just in terms of seeing how your heart rate is affected by exercise, but looking at readings while you're asleep and resting as well. 'It is amazing to think I can record my heart rate during really active periods, when I am doing sport and I am really looking forward to wearing the monitor when I am drumming. 'It is the perfect thing for me.' Robert Clark, vice president of marketing at Epson Europe, said there has been an increasing demand for wearable products, to fit in with people's lives . 'It is important that Epson innovates and moves with these exciting times. Devices that monitor a person’s activity are growing in popularity and we see great future potential in this market,' he said. 'Since we first began developing optical heart rate sensing products in Japan, we have been able to refine and minimise the technology to create a range of products that can outperform and offer more benefits than those currently on the market. 'Through our rich manufacturing heritage, we have developed a truly unique proposition that will contribute to the long-term success of Epson.' Harry raised more than £50,000 for The Teenage Cancer Trust and the Brain Injury Rehabilitation Trust running the marathon. The Epson Pulsense heart monitor can be worn like a watch and records the heart beat 24 hours a day . An ectopic heart beat is not a missed beat, rather an extra beat of the heart. After this extra beat there is often a pause which makes can feel as though a sufferer has 'missed' a beat. What causes ectopic beats? The electrical system of your heart is controlled by the heart’s pacemaker which is a group of specialised cells called the sino atrial node (SA node). The SA node is in the right atrium - the top right chamber of the heart and is one of the four chambers of the heart. An ectopic beat happens when the cells in another part of the heart create an electrical discharge, causing an ‘extra’ heart beat. What are the symptoms? A person with an ectopic heart beat might be aware that their heart has ‘missed’ a beat or feel it is thumping or pounding in the chest. A sufferer may feel a sensation of the extra beat in their ears or sometimes in the neck. When experiencing a few ectopic beats together, people report feeling a ‘fluttering’ sensation in their chest. Ectopic beats can be frightening but do not usually cause other symptoms. How common are they? Ectopic beats are common and most of the time people will be unaware of them. They usually happen when the heart is beating slower, for example at night or when you are relaxing. They can happen to anyone at any age whether you have heart disease or not. Are they dangerous? If a person are in good general health, ectopic beats are unlikely to be a problem. They can happen just occasionally in a regular pattern, or a sufferer may feel several happen at once and then stop. If a sufferer has also been diagnosed with coronary heart disease, it is important to speak to a doctor about any change in the pattern or rate of the heart beat. What can trigger ectopic beats? When a person is stressed or feeling very anxious, it can trigger an ectopic beat. This is because adrenaline and other hormones are produced by the body in times of stress and anxiety and may make ectopic beats more forceful or obvious to you. An ectopic heart best is when a person experiences an extra beat of the heart, which can feel like a flutter in the chest. Sufferers can also experience thumping or a pounding of the chest . A person may notice an ectopic heart beat if they: . How is the condition diagnosed? After taking amedical history, a doctor may refer a person complaining of an ectopic heart beat to have an electrocardiogram (ECG). Not all ectopic beats show up on an ECG, especially if they only occur every now and again. If symptoms persist further investigations including a 24-hour ECG recording can help diagnosis. How are ectopic beats treated? Ectopic beats in healthy people do not need to be treated unless they are causing symptoms. Identifying what triggers the ectopic beats can be helpful. By avoiding the trigger, it may be possible to eliminate the extra beat. For example, limiting the amount of caffeine and alcohol, stopping smoking may all help you to reduce the frequency of ectopic beats in some people. Exercise often helps those who are physically inactive. Dealing with anxiety and recognising what may trigger the ectopic beats can also help you to deal with them. There are no vitamins or food supplements that have been shown in research to stop ectopic beats completely.

"By . Mark Prigg for MailOnline . The powerful magnitude 6.0 earthquake that rocked California wine country early on Sunday morning woke up almost half of Nearby San Francisco and Oakland residents. Experts studied data from thousands of fitness bands that also track sleep. They found that even in San Francisco and Oakland, slightly more than half (55%) woke up. Use your mouse to see who woke up . The Northern California Seismic System reported Sunday that there is a 54 percent chance of another earthquake of magnitude 5.0 or higher within the next seven days. Along with the warning comes the likelihood of as many 70 aftershocks, reports the Sacramento Bee, that could remind Northern California over the next week that they live in an active fault zone. The USGS estimated that based on their locations, 15,000 people experienced severe shaking, 106,000 people felt very strong shaking, 176,000 felt strong shaking and 738,000 felt moderate shaking. Researchers at Jawbone released the data from users of its popular fitness tracker. 'Our data science team wanted to quantify its effect on sleep by looking at the data recorded by UP wearers in the Bay Area who track their sleep pattern,' Eugene Mandel of the firm said. 'Napa, Sonoma, Vallejo, and Fairfield were less than 15 miles from the epicenter. 'Almost all (93%) of the UP wearers in these cities suddenly woke up at 3:20AM when the quake struck. Farther from the epicenter, the impact was weaker and more people slept through the shaking. 'In San Francisco and Oakland, slightly more than half (55%) woke up. As we look even farther, the effect becomes progressively weaker — almost no UP wearers in Modesto and Santa Cruz (and others between 75 and 100 miles from the epicenter) were woken up by the earthquake, according to UP data.' The data also revealed that, possibly unsurprisingly, many struggled to get back to sleep. 'Once awaken, it took the residents a long time to go back to sleep, especially in the areas that felt the shaking the strongest. Barrels filled with Cabernet Sauvignon are toppled on one another following an earthquake at the B.R. Cohn Winery barrel storage facility. 'In fact, 45% of UP wearers less than 15 miles from the epicenter stayed up the rest of the night.' With the immediate dangers like gas-fueled fueled fires and toppling roofs now behind them, residents of Napa and surrounding Bay Area communities have begun to assess the damages, which the New York Times reports could reach $1 billion. Meanwhile, there could be more damages to come as experts warn that the next week could bring dozens of aftershocks, some of them nearly as powerful or even just as strong as Sunday's tremor. The Northern California Seismic System reported Sunday that there is a 54 percent chance of another earthquake of magnitude 5.0 or higher within the next seven days. Along with the warning comes the likelihood of as many 70 aftershocks, reports the Sacramento Bee, that could remind Northern California over the next week that they live in an active fault zone.

Reports had already come in Sunday afternoon of small aftershocks, which while not damaging served as uneasy reminders of the danger that had passed only hours before. The 30-second earthquake struck just before 3:30am between the towns of American Canyon and Napa in the heart of the state's famous wine country, Leslie Gordon of the U.S. Geological Survey said. It's the largest earthquake to shake the Bay Area since the deadly 6.9 magnitude Loma Prieta quake in 1989, the USGS said.

"By . Sarah Griffiths for MailOnline . When cars are involved in a crash, they risk being thrown on the scrapheap, wasting valuable materials. But in the future, we could grow new parts and vehicles could heal themselves. This is the vision of an artist who has imagined the benefits of creating cars from biological materials that could change and adapt to their environments. Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg, PhD researcher at the Royal College of Art, is working with synthetic biologists at Imperial College London to develop parts for a car of the future. Scroll down for video . Could we grow cars? An artist thinks that biological cars built from living materials could evolve and mutate. This is a sketch imagining how if Minis were made from biological materials, their design may start to diversify and evolve depending where they are made, used and repaired . Synthetic biologists aim to develop new materials that behave like living organisms. Ms Ginsberg believes that synthetic biological cars built from such materials could evolve and mutate so they could adapt to their environments like living organisms and has showcased her ideas at the Dezeen and Mini Frontiers exhibition. She told Dezeen: My concept is around ""repair ecologies"". Would cars that are repaired in a hot place be different to cars that are repaired in a city full of pollution, or cars repaired somewhere humid?’ While the development of such a car may take decades, Ms Ginsberg says that scientists are already researching and developing new materials so her vision could be possible one day. She is not only concerned with new materials, but in understanding how a car's design might change if industrial manufacturing was replaced with a biological process. Ms Ginsberg told MailOnline: ‘I'm not saying that this is the future, rather I'm asking what values we might want in a biological future and what best sustainable practice might be if we could design living things. The future? Ms Ginsberg (pictured) has imagined an alternative vision for sustainable car production.‘Instead of being built centrally and distributed globally, car shells would be fabricated using local biological materials, processes, feedstocks and expertise,' she said . Ms Ginsberg has imagined an alternative vision for sustainable car production. ‘A car company would distribute only a chassis and a form for the shell of the car to its workshops around the world. Instead of being built centrally and distributed globally, car shells would be fabricated using local biological materials, processes, feedstocks and expertise. So in areas there there are woods, a car might have a wood-based body, while places near the sea might build cars from seaweed or other local resources. ‘These shells could be as simple as being built from wood, or perhaps they could be grown from bioengineered materials that don't yet exist,’ she explained. ‘Should we reimagine what it means to design things? Instead of buying and throwing away as we do today, could products have different lifecycles that would change our expectations of how we consume things? She explained that scientists are already researching materials such as chitin, which is a biological plastic found in insects and crab shells, as well as bioplastics from corn. ‘Others are looking at self-healing materials like concrete infused with bacteria that secrete limestone on contact with water. Some of these new materials are starting to be used imperceptibly today.' If such materials were combined with synthetic biology – a new approach to genetic engineering – car parts and other objects could have their origins in biology. This might be radical, or the technology could be incorporated gradually so that consumers barely notice. Ms Ginsberg has imagined an alternative vision for sustainable car production. ‘A car company would distribute only a chassis and a form for the shell of the car to its workshops around the world. Instead of being built centrally and distributed globally, car shells would be fabricated using local biological materials, processes, feedstocks and expertise. So in areas there there are woods, a car might have a wood-based body, factories with access to corn may make cars from bioplastic, while places near the sea might build cars from seaweed or other local resources. ‘These shells could be as simple as being built from wood, or perhaps they could be grown from bioengineered materials that don't yet exist,’ she explained. A car crash idea? Ms Ginsberg said that her concept centres around 'repair ecologies. Would cars that are repaired in a hot place be different to cars that are repaired in a city full of pollution, or cars repaired somewhere humid?’ Currently, cars are repaired with metal after a crash (pictured) or put on the scrap heap . ‘I'm interested in thinking about how a single design might diversify, mutate and “inherit” traits over generations. ‘If the shell of your car was disposable, you might alter it depending on the climate you live in, or how often you drive or even better, in response to what the neighbours have done with their car! ‘In this project, I'm modelling a small one-person car that diversifies in over a hundred ways over 13 generations.’ Because materials such as wood are less durable than metal, Ms Ginsberg thinks they will need repairing more often. ‘The availability of local materials, the local repair traditions and climate differences would encourage design diversity. ‘Perhaps it would become desirable to make visible repairs, celebrating things ageing, getting damaged? You might customise the car for non-practical reasons, simply to show your individuality.' Last year, a British designer came up with a concept for a pair of shoes (pictured) made from ‘cells’ that regenerate so they don’t wear out - but just like the car, they cannot be put into production at present . Last year, a British designer came up with a concept for a pair of shoes made from ‘cells’ that regenerate so they don’t wear out. The strange 'amoeba' shoes are designed to be 3D printed using a material made of synthetic primitive cells that regenerates overnight – but it could be 40 years until they become a reality. The amoeba surface-adapting protocell trainers are intended to be the ultimate futuristic bespoke shoe that fit like a second skin and support feet in a new way. They will react to pressure created by a runner by inflating in places to provide extra cushioning where it is most needed. In order for the shoes to maintain their biological properties they must be stored in a jar filled with special photocell liquid overnight . The concept for the protocell trainer has been envisioned by London-based designer, Shamees Aden, who is fascinated in how new scientific practices could impact future products. The shoes will be composed of primitive cells called protocells, which are simple molecules that lack the complexity of biological cells. ‘They are life-like and not living,’ Ms Aden told MailOnline. ‘The amoeba surface-adapting trainer is a tangible product concept that seeks to probe the future of new materials, based on the advantages of science and particulate the science of protocells,’ she added. The shoes will fit like a second skin as the materials they will be made from is designed to act a little like human skin as the protocells will self-heal and will be responsive to pressure, despite not truly being alive.","Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg is working with synthetic biologists at Imperial College London to develop parts for a synthetic car of the future .

"By . Sarah Gordon . If you want to spot a hippopotamus, Colombia isn't the first country you would consider visiting. But if you head around 200 miles of the capital Bogota and you are likely to see hippos roaming free, and causing problems for the local community. The dangerous animals once belonged to notorious drug kingpin Pablo Escobar, who was killed in a shootout with police in 1993. Scroll down for video . Running riot: The hippos once owned by Pablo Escobar have now formed a 50-60-strong herd . The infamous gangster, who was on America's most wanted list for years and ran a drug trafficking cartel worth an estimated £15billion, smuggled in the creatures for a zoo he set up in his grand home Hacienda Napoles. And while the rest of the animals in the zoo were relocated following his death, the African hippos still remain at large. While the animals were left on the drug lord's ranch, they have started venturing further afield, with locals reporting that they are now using a pond near to a local school. Infamous: Hacienda Napoles, about 200 miles north of Bogota, was Escobar's hideout . Some families have even taken in hippo calves and nursed them at home as pets, according to El Colombiano newspaper. A young girl told the paper: 'My father brought a little one home once. I called him Luna (Moon) because he was very sweet — we fed him with just milk.' The animals, which are known for killing more people per year than lions, elephants, leopards, buffaloes and rhinos combined, are becoming a serious problem. San Diego University ecologist Rebecca Lewison told the BBC: 'It's just like this crazy wildlife experiment that we're left with. Gosh! I hope this goes well.' Locals in rural Antioquia, first started reporting hippo sightings in 2007, and now it is estimated there are between 50 and 60 of the violent animals roaming around the park which was once Escobar's opulent home. Museum: Burnt-out cars are on display at the ranch which now has exhibitions dedicated to the drug kingpin . However, despite a fence supposedly keeping them within the grounds, there have been increasing reports of the hippos bypassing the boundary and venturing into the surrounding area. Despite not being native to Colombia, the hippos are thriving, with females giving birth on average to a calf a year - higher than the average in Africa. They are also venturing ever-further, with sightings reported up to 150 miles away as well as complaints from farmers about them destroying crops and even killing cows. Dangerous: The hippos have found a way out of the ranch and now wander freely through the surrounding countryside . The gamekeepers who are responsible for the animals try to keep the hippos close by providing food, but the alpha male - known simply as El Viejo (the old one) - has been chasing the younger hippos off, forcing then to venture further away and form their own herds. Despite being rundown, Hacienda Nogales has reopened as an adventure park with a Jurassic Park theme, and touts itself as a family-friendly destination, despite its narcotic links. More animals are on order and giant dinosaur statues, commissioned by Escobar for his son, are also on display. The building at the ranch also has a museum dedicated to the drug trafficker.","Hippos smuggled into Colombia for drug baron's private zoo .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . On 6 August Nasa celebrated Curiosity’s second anniversary - in Earth time - on Mars. But a series of images has revealed the beating the rover has taken since it landed two years ago, with the Martian environment proving more than a match for the machine. While the mission continues to return incredible science from the red planet, the rate at which the rover is decaying will no doubt be a cause for concern. Scroll down for video . Before and after images of Nasa's Mars rover have revealed the damage it is taking. But experts from the Washington DC agency say it's not a problem - yet. In the images holes on Curiosity's wheels can clearly be seen (pictured). The aluminium wheels have been pierced by driving over sharp rocks . The Martian environment is incredibly hostile, even to a sturdy machine like Curiosity. During the day, temperatures fluctuate between highs of 20°C (70°F) and lows of -73°C (100°F), while dust storms rage across the surface and cover the rover in fine particles. The rover's top speed is 1.5 inches (3.8 centimetres) per second. Curiosity is the fourth rover to visit Mars. It took around seven minutes to land on the Red Planet. The rover is fitted with 17 cameras. It weighs about the same as a Mini Cooper at approximately 2,000lb (900kg). Scientists considered 60 possible landing sites before deciding on Gale Crater. In addition sharp rocks on the surface are piercing the rover’s wheels, gauging it with holes and causing ground controllers to come up with innovative solutions, such as driving backwards to reduce degradation. On the wheels of the £1.5 billion ($2.5 billion) rover, there are some holes intentionally put there to allow sand to drain through and provide added traction. Others, however, are certainly not planned additions; tears in the wheels can clearly be seen where rocks have pierced the thin aluminum. In these before (move the slider left) and after (move the slider right) images the degradation on Curiosity can clearly be seen. The before images were taken around the time the rover landed two years ago on day three of the mission, while the after images show it as it looked on day 689. The rover is now on day 729 . Occasionally the team will attempt to find a new route to take if the path ahead looks particularly hazardous. That's not always possible, though - for about half of July, the rover team at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, drove Curiosity across an area of hazardous sharp rocks on Mars called Zabriskie Plateau. Damage to Curiosity's aluminum wheels from driving across similar terrain last year prompted a change in route, with the plan of skirting such rock-studded terrain wherever feasible. But the one-eighth mile (200m) across Zabriskie Plateau was one of the longest stretches without a suitable detour on the redesigned route toward the long-term science destination, meaning the wheels had to grin and bear the ensuing damage. Some parts of the rover are caked in Martian dirt, but experts from the agency say this is not a cause for concern yet. The amount of dust accumulation on part of the rover is seen in these contrasting photos from day 36 of the mission and day 660 . Here dust accumulating on some of Curiosity's exposed wiring can be seen on day 32 and day 674 . Other parts of the rover, meanwhile, are caked in Martian dust. For Curiosity’s predecessors Spirit and Opportunity, dust was a big problem as they were solar powered. An accumulation of dust meant they were getting less power from the sun from their solar panels. Curiosity has an advantage here as it is powered by an on-board  nuclear power source, a small radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG), which contains 10.5 pounds (4.8 kg) of plutonium-238. 'The accumulation of dust is not a concern,' a spokesperson for Nasa tells MailOnline. 'Dust buildup matters more on Opportunity, which is solar powered.' Nonetheless, over time the accumulation of dust could pose a problem, particularly as much of Curiosity’s wiring is exposed. On board the rover is a coin used for calibration purposes, seen here. The before shot in this image was taken on day 34 of the mission, and the after shot came on day 591 . Unlike Curiosity's sister rovers Opportunity and the now-defunct Spirit, the accumulation of dust is not a huge cause for concern yet as the rover is nuclear powered. These images show day 30 and 718 of the mission . During its first year of operations, the Curiosity rover fulfilled its major science goal of determining whether Mars ever offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life. Clay-bearing sedimentary rocks on the crater floor in an area called Yellowknife Bay yielded evidence of a lakebed environment billions of years ago that offered fresh water, all of the key elemental ingredients for life, and a chemical source of energy for microbes, if any existed there. 'Before landing, we expected that we would need to drive much farther before answering that habitability question,' said Curiosity Project Scientist John Grotzinger of the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena. 'We were able to take advantage of landing very close to an ancient streambed and lake. Now we want to learn more about how environmental conditions on Mars evolved, and we know where to go to do that.' During its second year, Curiosity has been driving toward long-term science destinations on lower slopes of Mount Sharp. Those destinations are in an area beginning about two miles (three kilometers) southwest of the rover's current location, but an 'appetiser' outcrop named  of a base layer of the mountain named Pahrump Hills lies much closer - less than one-third of a mile (500m) from Curiosity. Curiosity landed on Mars on 6 August 2012, and recently Nasa celebrated its second anniversary on the red planet in Earth time. It completed its first Martian year - one revolution around the sun on Mars, which takes 1.88 Earth years - in July of this year. A large hole is seen here .","Before and after images of Nasa's Mars rover reveal it is taking damage .

"By . Mark Prigg for MailOnline . Boeing has taken a major step forward in its bid to replace the space shuttle. The aerospace giant has completed a key review of its design for a new commercial venture to fly astronauts to the International Space Station. The firm is in a four way contest with SpaceX, privately held Sierra Nevada Corp, and Blue Origin,  Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos company, to develop and build U.S. commercial space taxis to transport astronauts rather than relying on Russia to ferry them to the station. Boeing's CST will take crews of seven people to the ISS and other destinations . Boeing's design would be launched into space using the Atlas 5 rocket built by the United Launch Alliance, a venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp. It will take crews of seven people to the ISS and other destinations . That rocket uses a Russian-built RD-180 engine, which has also triggered some concerns given tensions with Russia. The multibillion-dollar program has taken on new urgency in recent months, given escalating tensions with Russia over its annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine. Nasa spokeswoman Stephanie Martin said the U.S. space agency planned to choose one or more of the competitors to continue working on the program in late August or early September. Martin confirmed that Boeing had completed a critical design review of its offering in the Commercial Crew Integrated Capability (CCiCap) program. She said Nasa was reviewing the data to determine if Boeing met its required 'success criteria' for the review. SpaceX and Sierra Nevada have sought and won extensions to finish their design reviews by May 2015. Blue Origin, a privately funded company set up by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos is also vying for the work. John Mulholland, vice president and program manager for Boeing's commercial space exploration programs, said the company faced some difficult challenges as it developed its design, but got 'excellent' feedback from Nasa during the review last month. 'From a technical standpoint, the review went very well,' he said. 'To the best of my knowledge we’re the only CCiCAP competitor that actually was able to complete all of the milestones in the period of performance,' he said. The CST-100 spacecraft will at first be used to take astronauts to the ISS, pictured. However, Boeing also envisages a future where it is used to transport astronauts to private spacecraft such as Bigelow Aerospace's inflatable habitats, which will be launched in the future . Mulholland said, measured in mass, the Boeing design for the cargo module was 96-percent complete at the time of the review, while its design for the crew module was 85-percent complete, two metrics that underscored the maturity of the design. He said the critical design review marked a major step for the Boeing program. 'You've got to be able to stand up at that review and show the analysis and tests that demonstrate that you're going to be able to meet those requirements,' he said. Boeing remains confident it could complete work on the new spacecraft in time to begin flight tests in 2017, Mulholland said. He said Boeing's design would be launched into space using the Atlas 5 rocket built by the United Launch Alliance, a venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp. That rocket uses a Russian-built RD-180 engine, which has also triggered some concerns given tensions with Russia. He said the module was designed from the beginning to be compatible with other launch vehicles, if necessary, although that would still entail some modification of the interface between the spacecraft and the launcher. Since the Space Shuttle was retired in July 2011, the US has relied on Russia to get its astronauts into orbit. But through their Commercial Crew Program, Nasa has been busy funding the development of a new breed of spacecraft. Boeing has unveiled a mockup of the interior of their new Crew Space Transportation (CST-100) vehicle that will be used to astronauts into space in the coming years. The capsule is funded by Nasa as part of their programme to develop private spacecraft . Boeing’s vision for the future of human spaceflight is the Crew Space Transportation (CST-100). They unveiled the new commercial interior . of its CST-100 next-generation manned space . capsule, showing how people other than Nasa astronauts may one day . travel to space. This is the first time they have made the design of the interior public. Boeing and partner Bigelow Aerospace highlighted the future commercial interior of the capsule it is developing for Nasa, while Bigelow showcased a full-scale model of its BA 330 inflatable space habitat that astronauts could one day live in. 'We are moving into a truly commercial space market and we have to consider our potential  customers - beyond Nasa - and what they need in a future commercial spacecraft interior,' said Chris Ferguson, former Space Shuttle Atlantis commander and current Boeing director of Crew and Mission Operations for the Commercial Crew Program. Engineers from across Boeing leveraged the company's decades of experience in commercial and government aerospace to design the capsule's interior. The capsule, interior view of a prototype pictured, will be able to seat a crew of seven and it will also be able to take cargo into orbit. It is in direct competition with SpaceX's manned Dragon capsule and Sierra Nevada's Dream Chaser space plane, all of which are vying to be the first private company to take humans into space . 'Boeing's teams have been designing award-winning and innovative interiors for our airplanes since the dawn of commercial aviation,' said Rachelle Ornan, regional director of Sales and Marketing for Boeing Commercial Airplanes. 'Designing the next-generation interior for commercial space is a natural progression. A familiar daytime blue sky scene helps passengers maintain their connection with Earth.' Three companies are currently receiving funding from Nasa to develop manned vehicles as part of the Commercial Crew Program. The . first is SpaceX, the company that seemingly came from nowhere a decade . ago and has now flown the unmanned Dragon spacecraft to the ISS three . times on its successful Falcon 9 series of rockets. They . are in the process of developing a manned version of the Dragon . spacecraft (mockup pictured above) that can take a crew of seven into orbit, with rumours . suggesting it may be unveiled this month with a view to launching its . first crew as early as next year. Boeing, meanwhile, with a rich heritage in space exploration is building the seven-seater CST-100 capsule. And finally Sierra Nevada Corporation are constructing what some regard as the true successor to the Space Shuttle. Known . as the Dream Chaser (test vehicle pictured below), this ‘mini-shuttle’ of sorts will launch upright . on top of a rocket, taking a crew of seven into orbit before gliding . back to Earth at the end of its mission.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . Astronomers have found the first ever evidence for the huge stars that are thought to have populated the early universe. With a mass many hundred times that of the sun, they would have lived very short lives and none are still in existence today. However traces of one has now been found, and the potentially groundbreaking discovery could yield fascinating information about the early universe. Astronomers using the Subaru Telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii say they have found the first ever evidence for the universe's first-generation of stars. It is thought these bodies exploded and ultimately gave rise to the heavy elements that formed the second-generation of stars . The discovery was made using a technique called stellar archaeology by Dr Wako Aoki and his colleagues at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan in Tokyo using the Subaru Telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, according a report in Nature. First-generation stars are objects formed in the early universe (within a few hundred million years after the Big Bang) from gas clouds containing only hydrogen and helium. They are the probable precursors of the formation of the universe’s structure and chemical enrichment; large stellar systems, such as galaxies, formed later. Maths simulations have made significant progress in understanding the formation of the first stars. Recent simulations suggest that a small fraction of very-massive stars with masses exceeding one hundred times that of the Sun could have formed in the early universe, even though the large majority of first stars formed with masses of ten to a hundred times that of the Sun. Their strong ultraviolet radiation and energetic explosions are likely to have had a significant impact on the evolution of stellar systems. When these stars exploded they left behind the heavy elements that would lead to the formation of the second generation of stars. In turn these also exploded, paving the way to the third generation of stars that includes our sun. This technique involved analysing the chemical composition of a second-generation star to find evidence of one of the universe’s first-generation of stars that led to its formation. By analysing such a star Dr Aoki’s team say they discovered that it likely formed from the remnants of one of its older siblings. It is thought first-generation stars were the first to fuse hydrogen and helium into heavier elements that would come to make up other objects like planets, and other stars. They are so old that they would have preceded most galaxies in the universe, but owing to their huge mass they lived lives of just a few million years. Scientists believe the universe began in the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago, but 800 million years later almost all of the first-generation stars had exploded in supernovae. Little is known about these  stars, but now the chemical signature of one has been found in one of younger siblings. When they exploded as supernovae, they created the first heavy elements that would ultimately lead to stars and galaxies. The evidence for this early star came in the remnants of a second-generation star called SDSS J0018-0939. Observations of its chemical composition suggest it formed from a cloud of gas seeded with material from the explosion of a single, more massive star - namely, a first-generation star. ‘The impact of very-massive stars and their explosions on subsequent star formation and galaxy formation should be significant,’ Dr Aoki told Space.com. Naoki Yoshida, an astrophysicist at the University of Tokyo who was not involved in the study, added in Nature: ‘This is a much awaited discovery.’ ‘It seems Aoki et al. have finally found an old relic that shows intriguing evidence that there really was such a monstrous star in the distant past.’ The discovery was made with the Subaru Telescope (pictured). The team found a chemical signature that must mean a younger star was made from one much older. If correct it would be the first evidence for a first-generation star ever found . First-generation stars (illustration shown) are objects formed in the early universe (within a few hundred million years after the Big Bang) from gas clouds containing only hydrogen and helium. They are the probable precursors of the formation of the universe’s structure and chemical enrichment . Second-generation stars are small, low-mass stars that have been around for about 13 billion years. Their tiny levels of heavier elements suggest that they coalesced from the remnants of much larger, first-generation stars. While the Big Bang is thought to have happened about 13.8 billion years ago, evidence for stars in the first few hundred million years of the universe's existence has been hard to come by. However, their existence has been inferred through the appearance of heavy elements after the Big Bang. Some elements in the universe could only originate in the cores of stars through the fusing of helium and hydrogen - and it must have been the elusive first-generation of stars that carried out the process. But until now, studies had failed to reveal the existence of these huge stars. Further studies will be needed to confirm these findings are correct, but Dr Aoki and his team are hopeful that this could be a precursor to similar discoveries, perhaps with the help of Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope after it launches in 2018.","Astronomers using the Subaru Telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii say they have found the first ever evidence for the universe's first-generation of stars .

"By . Chris Greenwood . Sally Bercow was castigated for lacking ‘common sense’ as she finally apologised for libelling Lord McAlpine yesterday. The Speaker’s wife issued a grovelling apology to the Tory peer at the High Court to draw a line under her comments on Twitter. The 43-year-old agreed to pay £15,000 in damages, which will be donated to the Chelsea Pensioners, and has been left with a six-figure legal bill. Payout: Commons speaker's wife Sally Bercow, left, has paid £15,000 in damages to Lord McAlpine, right, after she posted a defamatory tweet wrongly implicating him in a child sex scandal . Settlement: Mrs Bercow pictured at an earlier hearing into the matter at the High Court in May . The court ruled that if she returned to Twitter – having deactivated her account during proceedings – she must apologise. She . did so yesterday, posting: ‘I have apologised sincerely to Lord . McAlpine in court – I hope others have learned tweeting can inflict real . harm on people’s lives.’ Lord McAlpine’s solicitor, Andrew Reid, said the prolonged litigation had left Mrs Bercow ‘substantially out of pocket’. He . also accused her of damaging the health of Lord McAlpine, 71, by . prolonging the matter. The libel arose following a BBC Newsnight . programme last November over the abuse of young boys at care homes in . Wales. It alleged that ‘a leading Conservative politician from the . Thatcher years’ had been involved. As speculation raged over his identity, Mrs Bercow posted on Twitter: ‘Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *Innocent face*’ The . allegation was without foundation and Lord McAlpine announced that he . would pursue those who libelled him. The peer agreed a £185,000 . settlement with the BBC and £125,000 with ITV. But Mrs Bercow insisted that her Tweet was not defamatory and her lawyer described it as a ‘random thought’. Apology: Mrs Bercow wasn't present at the short hearing at London's High Court earlier today .

Travel mad Dylan Harris set up a firm offering daredevil tourists vacations to a string of bizarre destinations including the troubled Middle East country. Harris, 35, said: 'ISIS have not reached the area of Iraq where we go to and hopefully the US Air strikes will hold them back. 'We are checking the situation is a daily basis but for the moment it is business as usual.' Fancy this? Dylan Harris' firm Lupine Travel will continue to offer trips to Iraq despite the ongoing militant action . Clear message: The Foreign & Commonwealth Office's advice for travel to Iraq. Many of the areas on the tour (numbered) are pictured here in yellow, at the north end of the country. Erbil (2) is in the danger zone . Tour stops: 1 - Diyarbakir, 2 - Erbil, 3 - Rawanduz, 4 - Sulaymaniyah, 5- - Halabja, 6 - Duhok . Dylan is the owner of Lupine Travel and has offices in Manchester and China. The company are keen to stress that the tours take place in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. For approximately £750 you will get: . Keen back packer Dylan said: 'I spent most of my 20s travelling but found myself constantly looking for new experiences. 'I found the most rewarding travel experiences were to places with very few, if any, tourists. 'While visiting these places I met several others taking similar trips and the consensus was always the same - the logistics of visiting these countries were very difficult and costs usually high. Burnout: The unpredictability of the IS militants make a trip to Iraq at one's own risk . Careful: Kurdish troops forces position themselves on a road to monitor security and movements around Kirkuk, less than two hours away from one of Lupine's stop-offs at Sulaymaniyah . 'So I decided to try and build up a network of contacts in these places to make trips there easier and put my own packages together, for affordable prices. 'Personally I like Iran because it is so different from what you would actually expect. 'The people are some of the most friendly and well-educated around and the food is great - it is just a place that continues to surprise.' Tensions are high in Iraq as Islamic State fighters continue to bomb and attack many towns in the north of the country. The battles between Sunnis and Shiites are escalating, with bomb blasts killing over 30 people in Kirkuk and Baghdad on Friday. The innocent killing of U.S. journalist James Foley by the Islamic State militants in Syria has led for calls on the Barack Obama government for sterner action on the terrorists, in both Iraq and Syria. The foreign & Commonwealth Office have advised against all-but essential travel to the Kurdistan region of Iraq. Speaking to Mail Online, Harris said: 'Our next tour there is in October. At the moment we still plan to go ahead with the trip as the areas we are visiting are currently safe. 'If the situation deteriorates though we will re-evaluate and cancel the trip if we feel that it is too dangerous to visit. 'Clients are required to take out their own personal insurance.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . The FBI today released dramatic footage of the Times Square bomber, who used a bicycle to flee the scene after targeting a military recruiting center. Ten minutes of footage, showing the suspected bomber cycling away after leaving a device more powerful than both bombs used at the Boston Marathon, have been released. The early morning blast on March 6, 2008, is being linked to two earlier attacks at foreign embassies also in New York, with the belief the suspect is a serial bomber . See footage of the bike bomber: . Getaway vehicle: The bicycle police believe was used by the bomber who attacked Times Square in 2008 . 'Someone, somewhere, knows something . about a bomber who's still on the run,' FBI Assistant . Director-in-Charge George Venizelos, said. A reward for $65,000 is being offered for the first time, as the FBI confirmed it believes the attack on the Armed Forces Career Center could be linked to attacks on the UK Embassy in 2005 and the Mexico Embassy in 2007. Ten minutes of previously unreleased surveillance footage show the bomb detonating in Times Square and the suspected bomber cycling through the streets of New York on a blue Ross bicycle. The footage and photos of the attack are being put up on billboards in Times Square and across the northeast. Planted: The bike bomber left the homemade device at the Military Recruitment Center in Times Square . Explosion: A plume of smoke rises above Times Square after the bomb was detonated on March 6, 2008 . 'Today we're asking for the public's . assistance in finding those responsible and encouraging the public to . look closely at these photos and video, which could be the key to . breaking the case,' Mr Venizelos told ABC. It is possible the bomber was not working alone, the FBI said. Three figures are seen walking towards the recruiting center as the device is lit, and then walking off, seemingly with the bomber, according to the New York Times. 'Although the suspect appears to be working alone, he or she may have had a lookout or surveillance team of as many as five other individuals in Times Square at the time of the attack,' the FBI said. The force of the blast, at 3.40am, shattered the front of the recruiting center, and was heard by nearby hotel guests and subway passengers. It is not known if the suspect is a man or woman, or what age, race and height they are. Impact: No one was injured in the blast but several people were walking nearby as it went off . Escape: A cyclist believed to be the Times Square bomber is seen on surveillance video cycling in the city . Shortly after the 2008 attack, New York City Police Department Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly told San Francisco Gate: 'Although it was cold, it was not cold enough to require an individual to have everything covered. His whole face was pretty much covered.' The Times Square device was created from an ammunition tin packed with gunpowder. It was detonated in Times Square at 3:45am, damaging the iconic military recruiting station and blocking traffic for more than two hours. People who were already working in offices close to the explosion were not allowed to go home, and those arriving for work were turned away. 'The bomber narrowly missed killing or injuring passers-by who can be seen clearly in the vicinity, moments before the blast,' Mr Kelly said. 'The distance between polemics by bombing and the murdering of innocents is short.' The blue bike the bomber used to make a getaway was later found in a dumpster near Madison Avenue and 38th Street by workers, about three hours after the attack, according to Fox News. Bashir Saleh had been setting up his coffee stall near the recruiting center when the device was detonated. Wanted: The suspected Times Square bomber, who targeted the military recruitment center, is seen on surveillance footage . Crime scene: Times Square was closed off after the explosion as police searched for evidence . 'I heard a very loud explosion. It was the first time I ever heard such a thing. I thought it was some problem with the cart. I got a gas tank here. I thought it might have exploded, that’s how loud it was,' he told the New York Times shortly after the attack. 'I ran out towards the source of the noise. I saw a cloud of smoke, then I saw the police rushing towards it. In a matter of minutes there were 10 to 15 police cars. It was a scary experience for me.' The effects of the blast were felt by guests staying at the New York Marriott Marquis. 'I felt the building shaking, and then a second after, I heard the explosion,' Mercy Sepulveda, from Fort Lauderdale, Forida, said. 'It sounded like a gas tank exploding.' The recruiting center for all branches of the military, which had a $1 million redesign in 1999, had been a regular focal point for protests about the war in Iraq. The device and timing of the attack there was similar to explosions in New York at the UK Embassy in 2005 and the Mexico Embassy in 2007. In the British Embassy attack, two . devices packed with gunpowder were left in plant pots outside the . building on the day of the UK's general election. The building also served as offices for a company that had attracted protests after it supplied bulldozers to Israel. Target: The bomber attacked the US military recruiting center in Times Square . In 2007, two more hand-made devices were set off at the Mexico Embassy. Although people were in the building at the time, no injuries were reported. Like the Times Square bomb, the devices were detonated by hand between 3am and 3.45am, and witnesses reported seeing a person riding away on a bicycle. Anyone with information on any of the bombings should call the FBI at (212) 384-1000.","Explosion linked to attacks on UK and Mexico embassies in New York .

"By . Ryan Kisiel . Frozen on the spot amid booming music and dazzling  lights, an apparently terrified owl has to be coaxed to perform on Britain’s Got Talent. Rocky the eagle owl’s stressed appearance during live auditions has left the ITV show facing accusations of animal cruelty. The RSPCA said it was ‘very disappointed’ that producers had subjected the bird to the ordeal, while scores of viewers criticised the decision. Terrified: The RSPCA has stepped into the row over whether making Rocky perform amongst powerful stage lighting on Saturday's Britain's Got Talent, was cruel . More than 11million saw  Rocky nervously take to the noisy, theatrically lit stage shortly after the episode started on Saturday night. Owner Andrew Charlton led the owl out in front of apparatus usually used by dogs in agility contests before the judges, led by Simon Cowell, and a theatre audience of 2,000. But when Wagner’s Ride of the Valkyries came booming from the Birmingham venue’s music system, Rocky froze and remained glued to the spot, gripping the perch tightly. Despite constant pleas of ‘come on’, the Eurasian eagle owl refused to move – and appeared increasingly anxious as the audience erupted into laughter. Mr Charlton, 53, eventually moved Rocky on to the stage floor and again urged the bird to run through a canvas tunnel. Come out Rocky: Owner Andrew Charlton tries to coax the visibly anxious Rocky into the canvas tunnel . Pressure: Mr Charlton, 53, eventually moved Rocky on to the stage floor and again urged the rocky to run through the tunnel . Criticised: The RSPCA has called the performance cruel, saying it did not take Rocky's welfare into consideration . But  Rocky instead turned away from . the stage – triggering more laughter from the live audience, with hosts . Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly getting the giggles backstage too. After . numerous attempts, the owl was finally coaxed through the obstacle, but . the judges had already sounded their buzzers and voted the pair off the . show. Viewers took to . Twitter to complain that Rocky looked terrified by the ordeal. Animal . experts said the owl clearly seemed anxious, and was probably not used . to the bright lights and noisy buzzer used by the judges. The roar of . clapping and laughter is also believed to have added to the bird’s . stress. RSPCA senior . scientific officer Ros Clubb said: ‘Considering the flashing lights and . loud noises from the audience and buzzers it is not surprising this owl . didn’t perform as the owner expected. ‘Welfare of the animals should be paramount and it is disappointing to see this not being given due regard. ‘If people are unhappy, we would urge them to contact ITV directly to let them know the strength of their feelings.’ Laughing out loud: Presenters Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly were keeling over with laughter backstage . Lin Murray of the Hawk and Owl Trust said: ‘An owl, like all living creatures, deserves respect. It’s sad that people were laughing at it and probably unknowingly adding to its anxiety. ‘The guy handling the bird would have been stressed about having to go on stage in front of so many people and owls are incredibly sensitive – it would have picked up on that.’ Viewer Paul Evans tweeted: ‘Shocking start to #BGT poor Rocky the owl looked terrified, nothing worse than a chained up bird of prey.’ Mr Charlton, of Bourne in Lincolnshire, says on his website that he has been rescuing owls for more than 20 years. In a statement released by the show, he said: ‘If I had considered Rocky to be in distress I would not have put him on stage. And if he had been distressed in any way he would have taken flight and left the stage. Throughout the process the show was very supportive and accommodating of Rocky’s needs.’ The episode ended with salsa dancing grandmother Paddy Jones, 79, wowing the judges and being awarded the golden buzzer – a ticket straight to the semi-finals. A BGT spokesman said: ‘We take the welfare of all of our acts, including any animals, incredibly seriously. For Rocky’s performance we dimmed the lights and lowered the sound of the buzzers, as well as freezing the graphics on the screen on stage.’","Rocky the eagle own performed during Birmingham live audition .

Protection: The calves are kept warm and protected by a caring owner . Last year, in Kenya alone, 13.5 tonnes of ivory were recovered. The industry is estimated to be worth £12 billion annually. 'I want to help these animals because they are facing very bad problems,' he adds. 'Their mothers are being killed and no one is trying to help them except here in the nursery.' 'It's a good job to do because you can see what you are doing and the impact that you bring to the lives of these orphans.' Mbulu spends his entire day with the elephants, some as young as three months, nursing them back to health and even bottle-feeding the milk-dependent ones. He also stands watch for predators, like lions. The animals depend on their caretakers as fully as a human child would. Selfless: Mbulu also takes on the role of doctor when he has to care and treat the sick elephants . In fact, the keepers rotate their bottle-feeding duties to ensure that the elephants don't bond too closely and threaten their chances for survival in the wild. 'The public viewing is very important because it's the time  for the public to see the work that we do here,' Mbulu says. 'The majority of the orphans here are because of poaching and human-wildlife conflict, which is very challenging nowadays.' Many of the elephants were attacked by the same humans who killed their mothers. 'That's the reason we have to forward the awareness to the public,' he concludes. Touching moment: Even the elephants seem to recognise that they are in safe hands with Mbulu .","Peter Mbulu shares his story as an elephant keeper in Kenya .

"By . Chris Kitching for MailOnline . From robots that mix mai tais and mojitos to an electronic wristband and apps that put everything at passengers’ fingertips, the world’s newest cruise ship is wired with ground-breaking ‘smart’ technology aimed at taking the stress out of holidays. When Royal Caribbean International’s Quantum of the Seas officially sets sail in November, guests will be super-connected with a host of industry firsts intended to maximise their getaway even before they step on board. It is billed as ‘the world’s most futuristic and advanced ship’, and television presenter Jason Bradbury says the technological advancements will create a hassle-free holiday, especially for parents who dread the thought of getting luggage sorted and waiting an eternity to check in. Scroll down for video . Wired: Royal Caribbean International's newest ship, the Quantum of the Seas, has ground-breaking ‘smart’ technology aimed at taking the stress out of holidays . There's an app for that: Cruise Planner and Royal iQ allow passengers to research and book restaurant reservations and communicate with other guests . Shaken, not stirred: In the Bionic Bar, guests order drinks on tablets and then sit back and watch robots mix and deliver the cocktail of choice . Jewel of the seas: The exclusive North Star, a capsule attached to an arm, lifts passengers more than 300 feet over the ocean . One of the innovative features unveiled today is a gadget normally reserved for the likes of James Bond. When they step foot on the ship, passengers will receive a wristband that serves as a room key while allowing them to quickly navigate the enormous vessel and make purchases with a simple tap. With a pair of downloadable apps that put guests in the captain’s chair, Royal Caribbean is striving to make every journey on the Quantum of the Seas the most technologically-driven holiday in the world. The apps – Cruise Planner and Royal iQ – put guests in charge of their cruise choices, allowing them to research and book restaurant reservations, shore excursions and spa appointments on their own while organising their calendar and keeping in touch with other passengers and loved ones at home. Passengers will be able to browse the apps, check their email or video chat with relatives or friends – all from the high seas – on a broadband connection that offers the fastest internet speeds at sea, according to Royal Caribbean. Quantum of the Seas has a video game suite where guests can compete with other gamers worldwide or on other Royal Caribbean ships using Xbox Live . Giant: The massive 4,180-passenger vessel weighs 167,800 registered tonnes and has 18 decks, making it the third largest ship in the world . Relaxing: By day, a venue called Two70 is a place where passengers can chill out and take in 270-degree views of the sea . High fliers: At night, Two70 transforms into an entertainment venue featuring high-flying aerialists and performers . Bradbury, host of The Gadget Show and Motor Morphers on Channel 5, has partnered with Royal Caribbean to promote its Quantum class ships. He said holidaymakers will be blown away because the systems are seamless and easy to use. He said: ‘The app is almost like a kind of on board social network so you can socialise in the digital sense with the crew and the captain and the people who make the decisions that affect you. ‘They really thought about making some really smart decisions that make sure all your expectations are met.’ Bradbury is a big fan of Royal Caribbean’s attempts to appease the modern, tech-savvy traveller with faster internet speeds. Sluggish connections have long been a sore spot for cruise ship passengers. Royal Caribbean is promising industry-leading bandwidth with speeds matching the fast connections people enjoy at home, using a new generation of mid-Earth orb satellites. And it’s not just guests who will be using apps to make life easier. Crew members will use custom apps to keep track of guests’ choices for dining or spa treatments and tailor services to them. To make that happen, Royal Caribbean is giving a tablet computer to every crew member – 40,000 in total – on every one of its ships. Bionic Bar: Quantum of the Seas' robot bartenders are not just the first at sea – they’re the first of their kind anywhere in the world . Impressive: Quantum of the Seas was floated out of a dry dock in Germany earlier this month and will make its maiden voyage to North America in November . A new feature that is sure to wow passengers is found in the Bionic Bar, a brand new venue where robot bartenders will be put to work. These robot bartenders are not just the first at sea – they’re the first of their kind anywhere in the world. Guests order drinks on tablets and then sit back and watch the robotic arms do their thing as they mix and deliver the cocktail of choice. Bradbury said: ‘There’s a lot of show-stopping technology that’s on board these Quantum class ships, and [the robots] are the real items of interest. ‘All you will see behind the bar are the robots and if you choose a specific drink they will make it for you using very complex, rehearsed movements. ‘To interface with the public at sea, it’s really extraordinary. This isn’t something just for the launch, this is a permanent part, an important part of your entertainment experience and it’s very, very exciting and innovative.’ Indoor fun: The first bumper cars on a ship are found in a venue called SeaPlex, the largest sports and entertainment complex at sea . This rendering shows what Quantum of the Seas will look like once the finishing touches are applied to its exterior and interior . No window? No problem: Interior guest rooms without windows have ‘virtual balconies’ that display real-time sights and sounds  through 80-inch LED screens . Robotics are also at work in Two70, a cavernous space that is a place of relaxation during the day, with 270-degree views from the aft of the ship, before it becomes a boisterous entertainment venue at night. The venue has six ‘roboscreens’ that move or unite as one and a new feature called Vistarama, which transforms Two70’s floor-to-ceiling windows into a canvas for a digital show – real or imagined – using 18 projectors. Interior guest rooms without windows have ‘virtual balconies’ that display real-time sights and sounds of the sea through 80-inch LED screens. Quantum of the Seas’ staterooms – the largest of any Royal Caribbean ship – are equipped with USB outlets that allow guests to charge their smartphones, tablets or laptop computers. The ship’s exclusive ‘SMART’ system helps guests even before they step foot on one of the Quantum class ships. Passengers can generate boarding documents online, upload their own security photo and receive digital boarding confirmations. The system is aimed at making the check-in process a breeze for passengers, with guests being able to go from ‘shoreside to ship’ in 10 minutes with no check-in counter to navigate and no lines to stand in. Using their smartphones, guests can track their luggage in real time – from the drop-off point to their room – once it is tagged with RFID (radio frequency identification) technology at drop-off. Soaring to new heights: Guests can experience the thrill of skydiving in the middle of the ocean with the first skydiving simulator at sea . When Two70 becomes an entertainment venue at night, it uses six ‘roboscreens’ that move or unite as one to entertain passengers . High speed: Royal Caribbean is promising the fastest internet speeds at sea using a new generation of mid-Earth orb satellites . Chow down: Foodies will have their choice of 18 restaurants, including an Italian eatery developed by celebrity chef Jamie Oliver . But the real fun begins when they get onboard. The technological advancements unveiled today will be available on two other Quantum class ships – the Anthem of the Seas, which goes into service next April, and a third liner that has not been named. Quantum of the Seas is the third largest cruise ship in the world behind two other Royal Caribbean liners – the Allure of the Seas and Oasis of the Seas. It will offer several first-at-sea experiences, including the North Star pod that lifts passengers more than 300 feet over the sea, a skydiving simulator, bumper cars and roller skating. The ship’s connectivity makes it possible for one of its venues to become a video gaming suite where guests can compete with other gamers worldwide or on other Royal Caribbean ships using Xbox Live. Virtual Concert projects high-resolution footage, from a 16-camera shoot, across a series of screens to create a multi-sensory musical experience . Go for a spin: Quantum of the Seas will be the first cruise ship to offer a rolling skating surface . For foodies, Quantum of the Seas has 18 restaurants, including an Italian diner from Jamie Oliver. The massive 4,180-passenger vessel weighs 167,800 registered tonnes and has 18 decks. It emerged from a dry dock in Germany earlier this month and will undergo sea trials next month once all of its functions are tested and the finishing touches are applied to its exterior and interior. Quantum of the Seas will make its maiden voyage from Southampton to a port near New York on 2 November. From there, it will sail to destinations in the Caribbean, including the Bahamas and Bermuda, before it relocates to an emerging market in Shanghai, China in 2015. Two-night cruise packages are priced at about £500, while a 10-night excursion will set you back about £1,400. Starting next April, its sister ship, Anthem of the Seas, will sail from Southampton to destinations on the Mediterranean Sea.","Passengers will be super-connected during their stay on the Royal Caribbean International ship .

"By . Ryan Kisiel . Golden girl: Susanna Reid has been given a substantial pay packet for her upcoming role on Good Morning Britain . Poised, polished and posing in an eye-catching dress, Susanna Reid looks every inch the '£1million' breakfast television presenter. But according to her predecessors, no one will be impressed with the extra added gloss. In fact they think Miss Reid’s alleged huge salary will prompt viewers to switch off altogether. The comments came as the line-up for Good Morning Britain, ITV’s revamped breakfast show, was unveiled ahead of its launch next week. Former BBC star Miss Reid will be joined by ITV stalwart Ben Shephard, and Charlotte Hawkins and Sean Fletcher from Sky News. Now Nick Owen, who presented ITV’s Good Morning with Anne Diamond in the 1980s, has made a thinly veiled swipe at Miss Reid’s reported pay deal. He told Radio Times: ‘I think all these announcements about high salaries alienate viewers. “Here’s someone on a million pounds – you will enjoy them!” Who can relate to a presenter like that?’ Fiona Phillips, who presented GMTV with Eamonn Holmes, agreed with Owen, saying: ‘We weren’t out at premieres living the glamorous life. People don’t want to see that in the morning – they can’t relate.’ However, ITV told MailOnline on Tuesday : 'ITV are thrilled to . have Susanna as part of the new Good Morning Britain team but the idea . that she is being paid a salary in the region of one million is . completely untrue. It is far off this.' A similar big-money move from the BBC to ITV to launch the Daybreak show ended in tears for Christine Bleakley. Viewers switched off in their droves and the programme was cancelled. Scroll down for video . Team: Miss Reid, second from left, poses with colleagues Sean Fletcher, left, Ben Shephard, second from right, and Charlotte Hawkins, right . Miss Reid, 43, became a household name on the BBC Breakfast sofa and reached the final of Strictly Come Dancing last year. It . was reportedly this gruelling workload, together with having to commute . to the BBC in Salford from her £1million London home, which led to her . separation from partner Dominic Cotton, the father of her three sons. Now it seems Miss Reid is hoping Good Morning Britain, based on the capital’s Southbank, will start a new chapter in her life. Before Good Morning Britain: Susanna had previously played down reports she had been poached by ITV by saying she 'bleeds' BBC . She . said: ‘I feel very lucky. I get to do the school run when a lot of . working mums don’t get home until bed time. Of course I will bring this . side of me to the programme but I do think as a journalist, you bring . all of your experience.’ Susanna had previously played down reports she had been poached by ITV by saying she 'bleeds' BBC. She said: 'If you cut me open I would bleed BBC.' But after her move to Good Morning Britain was confirmed she took to her Twitter account to tell her 200,000 followers that she simply couldn't turn the chance down. She said: 'As a news journalist & presenter I couldn't turn down this opportunity and a new challenge. Fresh start: Susanna Reid pictured with Bill Turnbull at 6am at the start of her BBC Breakfast presenting stint at the BBC studios at MediaCityUK in Salford . 'Thank-you for your messages. I'm very excited to be joining Good Morning Britain. I have loved being at BBC Breakfast & will miss the team.' As the co-host of BBC Breakfast, Susanna was the only woman on the sofa, but she will now have to share the limelight with Charlotte. Charlotte took to Twitter on Tuesday morning to reveal she cannot wait to start working with Susanna, Ben and Sean. She wrote: 'Thrilled to be working with @susannareid100 @benshephard @SeanFletcherTV #GoodMorningBritain #6daystogo (sic).' Good Morning Britain launches at 6am on Monday 28 April.

"By . Katie Amey for MailOnline . Millionaire chef Rick Stein is branching out - to Winchester in Hampshire. The TV star has just announced plans to open his first restaurant outside of Cornwall. 67-year-old Stein is behind so many popular, tourist-friendly seafood eateries in Padstow, Cornwall, that the sleepy fishing village has since been affectionately dubbed 'Padstein.' The millionaire chef will be expanding his food empire to Winchester, Hampshire with a new restaurant . In Padstow, Cornwall, The Seafood Restaurant remains a local staple, serving fresh fish dishes everyday . His first Winchester offering, to be called 'Rick Stein,' is scheduled to open its doors in October. 'Our new restaurant will be about fresh fish, simply cooked,' Stein said. 'This is a big and exciting move for us, our first outside Cornwall, and we can't wait to bring our passion for seafood to Winchester.' 'I love Winchester,' he added. 'It's steeped in heritage, with beautiful architecture and seems to have a love of great food.' 'We have secured a high street position and the restaurant will seat 70 for lunch and dinner.' While Stein and his team will be recruiting some staff from the local area, the new restaurant will remain a family affair with his middle son, Jack, overseeing the menu development and kitchen as executive chef. Stein owns an empire that includes restaurants, hotels, cook books and even a cooking school in Cornwall . The new restaurant will feature classic dishes, such as turbot hollandaise, slip sole meunière and grilled lobster, as well as some dishes inspired by Stein's world travels. Eldest son, Edward, will also be involved with the renovation of the restaurant's interiors, while youngest son, Charles, will be supplying some of the wines for the eatery. Stein's business partner and former wife, Jill, said: 'The interior design of our Winchester restaurant will be understated with an urban feel and a subtle nod to our coastal roots.' Rick Stein's Cafe has helped to boost the Padstow economy with over 500 locals working for the TV chef . Rick and Jill Stein opened their flagship seafood restaurant in 1975 in Padstow and since then their multi-million pound business has grown to include five restaurants, accommodation, stores, and a cookery school. The Oxfordshire-born chef has also appeared on several television programmes, such as Rick Stein's Taste of the Sea, and released many cooking and recipe books over the years. His food empire is now worth at least £32 million and has had a significant positive impact on the local economy, employing nearly 500 people in Padstow alone. The Seafood Restaurant is a more pricey affair, while Stein's Fish & Chips offers more affordable takeaway . Hampshire is, unsurprisingly, very excited about the anticipated Rick Stein-fuelled tourist boom. The County Council's Executive Member for Economy, Transport and Environment, Seán Woodward, said: 'It's fantastic to hear that Rick Stein has chosen Winchester as the location for his new restaurant.' 'The Rick Stein restaurant will be a really welcome addition to this, attracting people from far and wide to the city and wider Hampshire county.' Tourist boom: The Hampshire County Council is eager to welcome Rick Stein food enthusiasts to their town . His newest restaurant's decor is said to be inspired by the family's coastal heritage .","Millionaire chef to open seafood restaurant in Winchester, Hampshire .

"By . Martha De Lacey . Surgery: British hospitals have reported a five-fold increase in labiaplasty in recent years . The debate surrounding labiaplasty has always been a contentious one. Is surgery to give you a 'designer vagina' a tool for female empowerment or an extreme example of women becoming the victims of an increasingly X-rated world? With UK hospitals reporting a five-fold increase in patients opting to undergo labia surgery - and some girls as young as 11 expressing interest - a research charity has released an animated film to explain the subject. In the Wellcome Trust's Centrefold Project, documentary filmmaker Ellie Land focuses on three women who have undergone the surgery. Each . woman had a different reason for opting to have the procedure - which . involves 'neatening-up' the genital area through cutting and stitching - . and each explains how she felt with the results. The first interviewee talks about how . she used to feel like a 'freak' because of her long labia, and that she . repeatedly dreamed they were a 'long, long scarf' wrapped tightly . around her neck that everyone was staring and laughing at. The . second divulges that her own large labia were not only unlike those of . other women, but that they affected her sex life because of 'mobility . issues' and that 'they would get in the way'. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Designer Vagina: Ellie Land's Centrefold documentary explains through animated film why some women would choose to undergo labiaplasty . The third woman says she worried her labia were 'long, dark, disgusting, shrivelled-up', and that she was quite embarrassed about it not being 'normal'. The women talk about spending hours flicking through porn magazines trying to find women with similar labia, but never managing. One . woman confesses that although her motivation for the surgery was . 'aesthetic', not a day went by when she didn't think about her vagina . 'in a bad way', and that she didn't look 'the way women were meant to . look'. Another says: 'The labia would rub and cause me a lot of pain - sometimes I even had little blisters.' Land also interviews the women after the procedures, and each explains how the surgery has affected their lives both positively and negatively. Speaking to MailOnline about her animated film, Land said: 'The focus of the film is to present a balanced view of labiaplasty, while reflecting the anxieties and concerns the women interviewed share about their labia. 'The film comments on some of the cultural factors that could be driving women's anxieties about their genitals, such as advertising, pornography and consumerism. Some of the interviewed women had physical problems with their genitals and so we find that women's reasons for surgery is a complex issue.' Am I normal? A still from Ellie Land's animated documentary which explores labiaplasty . Labia surgery costs over £3,000 if done privately, but 2,000 labiaplasties were carried out by the NHS last year, a fivefold increase on the last five years. To be eligible for the surgery on the NHS, a woman must have physical reasons which include pain during intercourse, discomfort due to rubbing clothes, rare hormonal disorders causing the labia minora to enlarge and damage done after giving birth. It is also possible to get a labiaplasty on the NHS in the absence of physical medical problems. If the size or shape of your labia are causing you real psychological damage - such as depression or self-esteem problems - women can be assessed by a GP to determine the need for labiaplasty and then referred to a gynaecologist. Speaking to the Huffington Post, consultant gynaecologist Dr Sarah Creighton said she sees patients as young as 11, and is surprised by what she believes is a new phenomenon. A second film available on . the Centrefold website which addresses recent research into labia . surgery. This film highlights the possible dangers that labia surgery . could present, because it is unknown what lasting effects the surgery . may have.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It takes a brave man to put his hands inside a tiger's mouth but this Buddhist monk seems to know exactly what he is doing. The big cats and the monks at the Tiger Temple have a unique relationship as the animals were either born in captivity or hand-reared from cubs. As these amazing pictures show, tourists and staff are able to get closer to the animals than almost anywhere else in the world. Scroll down for video . Cheeky: A Thai Buddhist monk plays with a hand-reared tiger at the Tiger Temple . Content: The tigers are hand-reared by monks at the temple meaning they are more used to human contact . Their tolerance of humans has made the Tiger Temple in Kanchanaburi province - about 80km from the capital Bangkok - one of Thailand's biggest tourist attractions. The photographs show one tiger allowing the monk to playfully put his hands in its mouth, while another shows the same big cat sticking his tongue out in a cheeky pose. Tourists travel from thousands of miles around to have such close access to the majestic animals. One lucky visitor was able to spend time bottle-feeding a tiger cub, while others stood within feet of adults as they played around in the water. The Tiger Temple was originally founded as a forest sanctuary but changed course when the first cub was brought to the monks in 1999. Since then it has grown to become home to about 90 big cats. Adorable: A tourist bottle feeds the cub at the Tiger Temple in Kanchanaburi province, Thailand . Conservation: The Tiger Temple is a tourist attraction and money is used to help care for the animals . On the agenda: The issue of Asian big cat conservation will be addressed at the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora in Bangkok . For a basic entrance fee - or . 'donation' - of 1,000 baht (about £22) visitors are given a tour of the . site and the chance to enter the sanctuary's Tiger Canyon - a quarry . containing sleeping tigers chained to the ground. For an extra fee, visitors can have their picture taken with a tiger resting it's head on their lap. The sanctuary has been dogged by controversy surrounding the ethics of how the animals are kept. In recent years, the temple has had to deny that it sedates the tigers to make them docile enough to be handled by tourists. The monks claim the animals are calm because they were hand-reared from young. Stand back: A Thai worker and tourists play with a tiger in the water at the Tiger Temple .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Amanda Knox has been spotted cycling around her hometown as she prepares to appeal against her conviction of the murder of British student Meredith Kercher. The 26-year-old was pictured riding her black-and-purple bike to a local Goodwill store in Seattle, Washington, on Saturday. She could be seen sporting a hooded top, gloves and bright pink socks - with her short hair tucked under a black helmet. Out for a spin: Amanda Knox, 26, has been spotted cycling around her hometown of Seattle, Washington . Exercising: The brunette was pictured riding her black-and-purple bike to a local Goodwill store on Saturday . Goodwill stores, which sell donated goods from the community, use their profits to provide free job training and basic education to people on low incomes. It comes just weeks after Knox was sentenced to 28 years in prison for killing Ms Kercher with the help of her then-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito. Ms Kercher, from Coulsdon in Surrey, was found dead with her throat slashed in the bedroom of her home she shared with Knox in Perugia, Italy, on November 2, 2007. Knox and Sollecito were convicted of her murder in 2009 and sentenced to 25 and 28 years in prison respectively. Concern: Knox, pictured fastening her cycling helmet, is preparing to appeal against her conviction of the murder of Meredith Kercher. She was sentenced to 28 years in jail in January for killing the British student . Casual dress: Knox could be seen sporting a hooded top, gloves and pink socks during her cycling trip . However, they were acquitted and released in 2011 after an appeals court reviewed the facts of the case. Following her release, Knox went back to her home in Seattle, Washington - and when the case went to retrial in September last year, she refused to return to Italy. However, on January 30, an Italian appeals court reconvicted Knox and her former boyfriend of murdering Ms Kercher . 'I am frightened and saddened by this . unjust verdict,' Knox wrote after the ruling. 'Having been found . innocent before, I expected better from the Italian justice system.' Preparing to ride: The brunette mounts her bike in Seattle as she prepares to cycle to the Goodwill store . Refusing to leave: Knox  and her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were convicted of Ms Kercher's murder in 2009 and sentenced to 25 and 28 years in prison respectively. But they were acquitted and released in 2011 . There are now questions over whether or not Knox can be extradited back to Italy to face her prison sentence. The decision is up to the U.S. Supreme Court, which must confirm Knox's guilty verdict before Italy can apply for her extradition and arrest. Sollecito, who was handed a 25-year prison sentence, was found a hotel near the Italian border following the appeal - and later had his passport revoked. Last month, Knox denied claims that her ex-boyfriend was trying to distance himself from her - writing on her blog: 'Raffaele has plenty of reason for resentment, but not against me. The . only reason he has been dragged into this is because he happens to be my . alibi.' Denial: Knox (left) has denied killing Ms Kercher (right), from Coulsdon in Surrey, who was found dead with her throat slashed in the bedroom of her home she shared with Knox in Perugia, Italy, on November 2, 2007 . Fight: Last month, Knox posted this image of herself holding a sign on Twitter - saying 'We are innocent' She added: 'He . is collateral damage in the unreasonable, irresponsible and unrelenting . scapegoating of the prosecution’s grotesque caricature that is ""Foxy . Knoxy"".' Knox's blog post came as she posted portrait of herself on Twitter showing her holding a sign declaring her innocence in Italian. In the black-and-white photo, she can be seen holding a piece of paper with the words 'SIAMO INNOCENTI', which means 'We are innocent'. Rudey Guede, whom Knox and Sollecito have . blamed for the murder of Ms Kercher, is currently serving a 16-year . sentence for murdering and sexually assaulting the student. Reconvicted: On January 30, an Italian appeals court reconvicted Knox and Sollecito (pictured the day after the murder) of killing Ms Kercher. Knox was sentenced to 28 years in prison, while Sollecito was given 25 years . During his trial, Guede admitted being at the murder scene - but insisted he had been in the toilet at the time Ms Kercher was attacked. He claimed he had emerged to see ‘someone resembling Sollecito’ fleeing the scene and ‘Knox outside the house’ in Perugia. Last month, Guede's lawyer, Valter Biscotti, revealed the prisoner was now eligible for day release - and had been given permission to study History at an undisclosed university in Italy.","Amanda Knox pictured cycling to local Goodwill store in Seattle, Washington .

"By . Mark Duell . The family of one of the two young farm workers who died on a Tory peer's country estate have spoken out of their 'utter devastation' at his death. Ashley Clarke, 24, was engaged to his long-term girlfriend and has been working to save up to marry her when tragedy struck on Monday afternoon. Mr Clarke and colleague Scott Cain, 23, were discovered unconscious in an apple store on the 2,500 acre property owned by the Earl of Selborne, John Palmer. Frantic colleagues at the Blackmoor Estate at Liss, Hants, tried in vain to save father-of-one Mr Cain and amateur rugby player Mr Clarke. Tragic loss: Scott Cain (right), 23, was engaged to marry his long-term girlfriend Filipa Turner (left), 24, and had a young daughter called Isla (centre), three . It is thought that the workers, who . were collecting apples, were “overcome by fumes” and unable to breathe . after entering the building which is kept cool by a system that uses . nitrogen. Worried colleagues at the renowned . fruit farm raised the alarm when the pair failed to come back from their . duties on Monday afternoon. But despite the efforts of colleagues . and paramedics the men, who were both found to be in cardiac arrest, . were tragically pronounced dead at the scene. The family of Mr Clarke along with . his fiancee, Rachel Higgins, and her family have released a statement . through police where they express their devastation at their loss. They said: ‘Words cannot express the pain we are all feeling at Ashley's passing. ‘He was the very heart and soul of . both our families and he was so much in love with Rachel that it hurts . to see the torment she is going through. Father of four: John Palmer is the fourth Earl of Selborne. He is a member of the Conservative party . ‘He had a passion for life and the utter devastation felt by everybody who knew him is testament to his popularity and the impact he had on many of those who knew and loved him. ‘We still have many questions which will need to be answered in the fullness of time, but nothing will bring Ashley back or take away the incredible pain we are all feeling. ‘We have lost someone special, a son, a brother, fiance and friend who can never be replaced and we will never forget him. ‘But for now we need to grieve, supporting each other to help us through what are very difficult times.’ Hampshire Constabulary and the Health . and Safety Executive (HSE) have launched a joint investigation into the . deaths which are being treated as “unexplained”. Blackmoor Estate, which was . established in the 1920s, has a long-standing reputation for growing . both traditional and new varieties of English apples, pears, plums which . are also used to produce cider and juices. It is owned by the fourth Earl of . Selborne, 72, who is a member of the Conservative party and entered the . House of Lords in 1971, becoming a hereditary peer in 1999. Staff on his country estate, where . the fruit is grown, stored, graded and packed, were last night said to . be distraught over the tragedy. Lord Selborne’s son, William Wolmer, . Managing Director of Blackmoor Estate Limited, said everyone was . “absolutely devastated” by the deaths. He said in a statement: ‘This is absolutely devastating for our tightknit community and our thoughts are with their loved ones. ‘The cause of this tragic incident is being investigated and the estate is co-operating fully with the authorities.’ Estate: Fruit packers Scott Cain, 23, and Ashley Clarke, 24, had entered a storage building on Lord Selborne's Blackmoor Estate (pictured) near Selborne, Hampshire, to collect apples on Monday afternoon . Location: The deaths happened on Blackmoor Estate near Selborne, Hampshire, on Monday afternoon . Keen footballer Mr Cain, from . Liphook, had been engaged to marry his long-term girlfriend Filipa . Turner, 24, and had a three-year-old daughter called Isla. Relatives said last night that Miss Turner had been left “devastated” by his death. Mr Cain was a centre-back at Wey Valley Football Club, after joining its under-15 squad eight years ago. Club manager Nigel Welch described him as a “star” and a “super lad” who was the “heart and soul” of the club. Team mate Daniel Mobsby-Brown said the defender was “smitten” with his young family. The 33-year-old added: ‘Scott had a lovely daughter and was engaged to marry his long-term girlfriend. ‘He spoke about them all the time, and they would always come and watch him play. ‘He was a loving, caring, family man, who was smitten with them. ‘His death will be a devastating loss for his family, and I can’t imagine how they will be feeling right now. Blackmoor Estate has a long-standing reputation for growing both traditional and new varieties of English apples, pears, plums. The fruit farm was established in the 1920s and the estate boasts more than 250 acres of orchards. Thanks to significant investment in recent years, the packhouse has more than 2,000 tonnes of refrigerated and controlled atmosphere storage and two apple graders. Blackmoor packhouse has a reputation for high-quality storage and service and has won numerous awards for long term storage of Cox, Bramley and Gala apples. It won the Marden Fruit Show Society prizes for long term storage of Gala last year, and the packhouse manager won the best store manager award. ‘It’s also a tragedy for everybody that knew him.’ The local business man said that Mr . Cain had been engaged to his fiancé for several years but the couple had . to put the wedding off while they saved up. A neighbour described Mr Clarke, who lived with his girlfriend Rachel in Bordon close to the farm, as a “devoted son”. She said: ‘He was a lovely man, I’ve . known him since he was just a boy and it is absolutely tragic. He was . saving up to marry his girlfriend next year.’ A friend said that amateur rugby . player Mr Clarke had found Mr Cain unconscious in the huge chiller and . collapsed himself as he tried to revive him. Mr Clarke played as a back row forward for Portsmouth-based rugby team Southsea Nomads. Club chairman Martin Drum said: ‘He . was a smashing lad. One of the best and bravest rugby players you could . ever wish to have. He was so well loved by everyone at the club. ‘He comes from a lovely family. When everyone finds out there will be a lot of devastated people around. ‘He played as a back row. Whenever he . went down on the floor or got hurt he would always get straight back up . and carry on with a big smile on his face.’ Tributes were left at a makeshift shrine in front of the store at the farm. Mr Cain’s devastated brother left a . bunch of flowers with a note reading: ‘Remembering a Dearest Brother . Scott. I will always love and remember you x.’ The results of initial post-mortem examinations on the workers have proved inconclusive. The coroner is now awaiting the results of toxicology tests to find out how Mr Cain and Mr Clarke died. An inquest is due to be opened and adjourned on tomorrow morning. North East Hampshire coroner Andrew . Bradley said: ‘The farm workers were going into the apple store, which . is kept cool by nitrogen, to look for apples. ‘We don’t know what happened after . that - I presume they were overcome by fumes and the absence of oxygen, . but we can’t be sure yet.’ Fruit can be kept fresh through controlled atmosphere storage, which regulates temperature, oxygen, carbon dioxide and humidity. Typically, the ripening process is . slowed by storing fruit in sealed rooms, where oxygen levels are reduced . by the infusion of nitrogen gas.

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Home loans taken on by first-time buyers are at their highest level since records began 40 years ago, according to alarming figures from banks and building societies. Typically, young buyers are borrowing the equivalent of 3.47 times their gross household income, leaving them particularly vulnerable to any rise in interest rates, which could come later this year. The trend appears to be at odds with the affordability tests brought in by the Financial Conduct Authority in April. How much? First-time buyers are taking on the highest number of loans since records began 40 years ago . Its mortgage market review (MMR) has required lenders to make much more stringent checks on the income and spending patterns of buyers to ensure they can meet repayments. In theory, these affordability tests look at everything from spending on haircuts to gambling, holidays and childcare before agreeing a loan. Many experts predicted that the review would lead to a sharp fall in new buyers and long delays in mortgage approvals. However, figures released by the Council of Mortgage Lenders yesterday suggest this has not happened. There were 28,600 loans adding up to £4.2billion to first-time buyers in June. This was a rise of 7.1 per cent on the previous month and 18.7 per cent higher than in June 2013. At the same time, the average loan rose to £123,865. The June increase took the total number of loans to first-time buyers to 79,900 for the second quarter of 2014, which was up by 24 per cent on the same period last year. Matthew Pointon, of analysts Capital Economics, said the figures ‘suggest that the mortgage market review has not slammed the brakes on lending’ The CML said the average loan in relation to income has been rising steadily over the past year from 3.33 in the second quarter of 2013 to 3.47 today. This is the highest figure recorded by the CML since it began collecting the data in 1974. Looking at the whole property market, the CML figures show that a total of 171,000 loans for house purchases were approved in the second quarter of 2013, up by 19 per cent on a year ago. Matthew Pointon, of analysts Capital Economics, said the figures ‘suggest that the mortgage market review has not slammed the brakes on lending’. He added: ‘The breakdown between types of buyer shows that it is first-time buyers who are still driving the rise in lending. There is no evidence that the mortgage market review has tightened up lending criteria.’ Mr Pointon said an increase in interest rates would put a strain on those carrying big mortgages. ‘That said, we only expect interest rates to rise very gradually next year,’ he added. During past property booms, some young buyers were borrowing five or six times their income, while others effectively invented a claimed income in order to borrow huge sums under so-called self-certified mortgages. However this was always a minority and the mean figure for all first-time buyers was generally around three times income. Paul Smee, of the CML, said the review had not had the effect anticipated by many in the industry. He added: ‘For the second month running since new FCA rules took effect, lending characteristics remain similar to the market beforehand. ‘We now feel confident that, as we would hope, the MMR effect is more gentle dampener than hard brake. ‘As we recently suggested in our revised forecasts, lending levels should continue to increase modestly over the course of the year, driven mostly by house purchase but with remortgaging also recovering.’ Getting the right mortgage is essential to making sure buying a home is as affordable as possible.

"By . Sarah Bull . She was the butter-wouldn't-melt star of hit kids' comedy show Sam & Cat. But it seems that Jennette McCurdy's out of office activities may have led to the unfortunate early end of the Nickelodeon programme. Production on the show has reportedly stopped and it is unlikely to be renewed for a second season following selfies of Jennette, 21, wearing just her underwear being leaked on the internet. But there are also claims that the show has not been renewed because Jennette, who skipped the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards last weekend, has fallen out with the network over pay - and is upset that her co-star Ariana Grande earns 'way more' than her, TMZ reported. Not so innocent: Jennette McCurdy, the star of Nickeldeon's Sam & Cat, right, was left red-faced when photos of her in her underwear, left, were leaked online. The show has not been renewed for a second season . 'The photos caused no issues and we have the utmost respect for her': The network denies that the leaked racy pics are behind the production hiatus, while the star herself insists her unhappiness stems from Nickelodeon's 'treatment' of her . Deadline Hollywood . claim that the fact there has been no announcement about the renewal of . the show for a second season is incredibly unusual considering the . immense success of the 40-episode first series. The scandal began last month, when the images of Jennette in a bra and thong hit the web after she publicly slammed Detroit Pistons player beau Andre Drummond for being a bad kisser. However, despite Jennette insisting she only sent the images to one person, Drummond has insisted that he wasn't responsible for the leak. When Jennette failed to attend the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards, despite being nominated for Favorite TV actress, over the weekend, rumours of trouble between the young star and the TV network continued to spread. Jennette posted a lengthy message on . her Twitter page in an attempt to explain her absence from the red . carpet awards to her fans, writing: 'A lot of you guys are . asking why I didn’t attend the KCAs. Scandal-hit: 21-year-old McCurdy shares her own scantily-clad images on her Facebook and Twitter pages . Star: McCurdy is on the show with Ariana Grande, right, with whom she has reportedly been feuding with . 'I wish I could explain everything . as thoroughly as I would like to, but unfortunately a simpler . explanation is all I can write. I was put in an uncomfortable, . compromising, unfair situation (many of you have guessed what it is) and . I had to look out for me.' Making reference to a reported feud between herself and co-star Ariana Grande, Jennette continued: 'I chose to not go because sticking up for . what is right and what is fair is what my mom taught me is ALWAYS the . most important thing. 'I want to thank those of you who have reached out . with kind words of support, McCurdians and Arianators alike. No matter . who or what you support, I believe in supporting fairness first. If you . have done that, thank you.' She then added: 'My previous tweet has . nothing to do with pics leaked.oh you guys lol. It has to do with how . nickelodeon treated me. That’s all. Thanks for the love.' Knock-on effect: Despite being the highest-rated show on the network, extended from 20 to 40 episodes just one month into its first run, the series is yet to be renewed for a second season following the scandal . Staying at home: McCurdy, who shared these images on Facebook, said her absence from Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards last weekend had nothing to do with the leaked photographs . The way they were: While it's been reported that the discord between the friends is nothing personal, Jennette's decision to ditch her pal at the awards show on the weekend suggests otherwise . And a spokesperson for Nickelodeon told the New York Daily News reiterated that the pictures were not to blame for any 'feud' between them and Jennette. A statement read: 'The photos caused no issues between McCurdy and the network, and we have the utmost respect for her.' And of the claims that the show has wrapped early, officials said: 'We are wrapping up what was an unusually long production cycle of Sam & Cat, and everyone is understandably tired. 'We are going into our production hiatus next week which will give everyone on the show a much needed rest.' In the series, which took home the Favorite Show award at the ceremony, Jennette and Ariana, aka Sam & Cat, are roommates who also run a childminding company.","Photos of the 21-year-old Nickelodeon star posing in her underwear were leaked on the internet last month .

"By . Ruth Styles . She's famous for her penchant for all things high street and it seems the Duchess of Cambridge's thrifty approach to shopping also stretches to designer buys. The future queen was spotted rummaging through the rails at the Bicester Village outlet centre in Oxfordshire on Sunday and according to staff, snapped up a bargain pair of pyjamas for Prince George. Afterwards, fellow shoppers took to Twitter, where they described themselves as 'chuffed' and 'overexcited' to find themselves indulging in a spot of retail therapy alongside the Duchess. Scroll down for video . Thrifty: The Duchess loves a high street buy and has worn this Hobbs dress twice in the last month . 'Chuffed to bits,' tweeted a delighted Leah Byrne. 'I met Kate Middleton today, had a little chat and she was lovely!' Another, Laura Isabella, added: 'Still quite overexcited about exchanging smiles with Kate Middleton this morning!' 'Kate came in on Sunday on her own, just like anyone else, and browsed the sales racks,' a shop assistant added in an interview with the Sun newspaper. 'At first I didn't recognise her - I couldn't believe it was Kate. She was very friendly and I was starstruck to be honest.' During her visit, the Duchess was seen picking up a pair of pyjamas for Prince George in Lacoste, before scouring the sales rails in Reiss - a perennial favourite of hers. Popular: Bicester Village designer outlet is a favourite of the Duchess because 'everything is so contained' Bargain buy: This M Missoni coat-dress was picked up in Bicester Village's Missoni designer outlet store . Other stores visited included Ralph Lauren, Bonpoint and Gucci where she spent more than 30 minutes picking through the discount bags and clothes. Sunday's visit isn't the first time that the Duchess has been spotted hunting for bargains at Bicester Village either. During the 2012 tour of the Far East, Kate told Singaporean journalist Sadiah Bte Shahal that she 'loved' Bicester because 'everything is so contained'. Pieces snapped up during shopping trips to the outlet store include her blue M Missoni coat-dress, which she wore first to a wedding and then for an engagement with the Duchess of Cornwall during the Diamond Jubilee tour in 2012. So popular did the petrol-blue tweed coat prove among Duchess of Cambridge fans, the brand reissued the piece. Not that the delighted staff at Bicester Village were prepared to reveal what she bought this time. 'We never comment regarding her visits,' a Bicester spokesman said when approached by MailOnline for comment. 'Yes, obviously she has been here in the past.' Lucky boy: Prince George, seen here in his birthday portrait, got a pair of pyjamas from the shopping trip . Second time: The coat had been worn to a wedding shortly before the 2012 visit to Nottingham with the Queen .

"By . Gerri Peev . Prime Minister David Cameron is under pressure to deliver on his pledge to claw powers back from Brussels . Britain’s opposition to draconian Brussels’ measures has been over-ruled by the EU on every occasion since records began. Official figures show that the British government has failed to stop 55 new laws being introduced by the European Council since 1996. Experts said it was evidence that Britain had little influence in Europe and over other member states. Matthew Elliott, CEO of the pressure group Business for Britain, said: ‘It is clear that Britain’s influence in Europe is not as high as many would have us believe. 'With the EU regularly acting against the UK’s national interest, the Government must push for proper safeguards in the forthcoming renegotiation.’ EU legislation that Britain has tried to block includes restrictions on car emissions which the UK government warned would cost the UK up to £56 billion and the draft 2013 EU budget which the Treasury said would cost the UK £8.6 bn. The UK’s voting power in the Council of Ministers has decreased from 17 per cent to 8 per cent since 1973, when it first joined the European community. In the European Parliament, it has also more than halved from 20 per cent to 9.5 per cent and in the European Commission it plummeted from 15 per cent to 4 per cent. The figures for how objections have been ignored - obtained under freedom of information requests - came just days after polling by Lord Ashcroft, the former Tory party treasurer, revealed that 72 per cent of Britons had no confidence in the country’s ability to secure a better deal from Brussels. Britain has voted ‘no’ on 55 separate occasions since 1996 - but on every occasion, that legislation was passed by the Council. Business for Britain called for a ‘red card system’ - backed by many Conservative MPs - that would allow national parliaments to join together and veto new European laws. The group also backed Chancellor George Osborne’s push for two separate votes to take place - one for Eurozone members and one of non-Eurozone countries. Both groups would have to vote in favour of a measure for it to be adopted. The UK¿s voting power in the European Parliament has more than halved from 20 per cent to 9.5 per cent . Critics pointed out that the EU was increasingly operating on Qualified Majority Voting rather than unanimity. This removes Britain’s ability to veto laws that are against its national interest. But a spokesman for the Foreign Secretary disputed the methodology used by Business for Britain, pointing out votes against were usually only recorded when a vote was likely to be pushed through. He said: ‘This report is not accurate. The Council of Ministers usually only vote when there is a qualified majority in favour so, by definition, if the UK is opposed on an issue that goes to a vote we are going to lose.’ The spokesman added: ‘The report doesn’t look at the countless times we have worked with allies behind the scenes to block proposals that are not in British interests, or to negotiate changes to turn them to our advantage. ‘From the first ever cut to the EU’s budget to getting Britain out of Eurozone bail outs to fundamental reform of the disastrous Fisheries Policy to protections in Banking Union, this Government is succeeding in bringing real change to the EU.’ He added that the UK had successfully blocked the establishment of an operational military HQ for a European military in 2011 but this had not been recorded by the study.","UK government has failed in 55 attempts to block the European Council .

"By . Emily Allen . Pressure to avoid offending minorities has caught up with Britain’s 150,000 users of sign language for the deaf, according to a Government-funded report. It found that younger deaf people have changed the way they give the sign to say someone is gay, or to describe Chinese, French and Jewish people. The old gesture that meant gay – a flicked limp wrist – is now considered offensive among some users of British Sign Language, researchers at University College London said. Evolving: Britain's young deaf community have adapted signs they use so they don't offend other cultures . Similarly it is no longer acceptable among politically correct deaf people to give a slanted eye sign to indicate something Chinese, nor to mime a hooked nose to mean a Jewish person. Over three years, scientists at the Deafness Cognition and Language Research Centre at UCL filmed the signs for more than 100 words used by 250 people in eight cities. Centre director Professor Bencie Woll said: ‘The younger deaf community doesn’t use these old signs because of a clear process of political correctness, in the same way that the hearing community no longer calls gay people “pansies” or “queer”.’ Young deaf people have also dropped the sign of twirling an imaginary moustache for France, said the researchers. They sign a gay person with an upright thumb on one hand in the palm of the other, wobbling from side to side, and India is signed using the triangular shape of the subcontinent. Professor Bencie Woll, director of DCal, said that the changes to sign language were much like the changes to spoken English . She said the change in sign language . has been faster because when signers began to communicate over the internet . they could see for the first time how 'foreign signers referred to . themselves'. Young deaf Britons have changed the way they sign certain words, including gay, Chinese and Jewish . British Sign Language (BSL) is the preferred language of between 50,000 – 70,000 people within the UK. Within Britain the most common form of Sign Language is called British Sign Language (BSL). Sign Language is a visual means of communicating using gestures, facial expression, and body language. Sign Language is used mainly by people who are deaf or have hearing impairments. Records exist of a sign language existing within deaf communities in Britain as far back as 1570. British sign language has evolved, as all languages do, from these origins by modification, invention and importation. Thomas Braidwood, an Edinburgh teacher, founded 'Braidwood's Academy for the Deaf and Dumb' in 1760 which is recognised as the first school for the deaf in Britain. His pupils were the sons of the well-to-do. His early use of a form of sign language, the combined system, was the first codification of what was to become British Sign Language. She told the Guardian: 'The younger deaf community . doesn't use these old signs because of a clear process of political . correctness, in the same way that the hearing community no longer calls . gay people 'pansies' or 'queer',' she said. 'But what the hearing community . doesn't understand about sign language is that even though the . traditional signs are now considered offensive, they are not producing a . real-life insult when they are used because they are not just visual . representations of a concept.' The revelation follows a study by the British Sign Language Corpus Project which has been studying how deaf people use sign language. They have filmed and interviewed 249 deaf people from . eight cities across the UK. Dr Kearsy Cormier, who was in charge of the three . and a half year project, hopes that deaf children will benefit from the findings. She said it would give deaf people a better understanding of regional variations in sign language. An online dictionary is expected to be created following the research. However, there are concerns among the deaf community about these changing signs and new political correctness. Gwilym Morris, from the deafness cognition and language research . centre (DCal) at University College London, told the newspaper: 'We are nervous about this being seen as . another example of political correctness because the changes are more . about evolution rather than dictat of some body that approves language.' Those who took part in the survey, which was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council,  were filmed in pairs and had to recount a personal experience, engage in a 30 minute conversation and participate in an interview on language awareness and attitudes. They also had to elicit 102 signs known to vary across the UK.","Today the only acceptable way to sign China is .

"By . Sean Poulter . A hotel price-fixing scam that led to guests being overcharged for rooms on ‘discount’ websites has been brought to an end following an investigation by the consumer watchdog. The Office of Fair Trading probe found some hotel chains had joined forces with booking sites, meaning the ‘cheap’ rates offered online were really the same as the normal price. As a result, people shopping around for cut-price rooms on the internet have been wasting their time. Agreements: Expedia was one of the websites involved in the discount capping deals with hotel chains . The OFT probe looked at the activities . of the InterContinental Hotels Group, plus Booking.com and Expedia. Both  sites entered into agreements with the chain that restricted their . ability to discount the rate for room-only hotel bookings. The . ‘sweetheart’ deals have now been blocked by the OFT. All three . companies have signed a legally-binding agreement to end the . price-fixing regime, to avoid legal action. It is hoped the move will . bring about a 10 to 20 per cent reduction in rates. But . some industry insiders believe the new regime will make little . difference. This is because the agreement contains several small-print . clauses which mean travellers will have to jump through hoops to make . sure they get access to the best discounts. Families will have to sign up to a membership scheme of the online travel agent (OTA) or hotel to be able to view specific discounts. Before people can book any discount deal they must first have made at least one undiscounted booking with the agent or hotel. The discounts offered by OTAs will be funded through their commission or margins. Booking.com: The OFT found hotel chains and travel websites had been capping discounts so people shopping around for cheap rooms have been wasting their time because websites and hotels charge the same . Consumers' anger over rip-off holiday prices has been boiling over in recent days. Eariler this week one man's rant about the hike in the cost of Center Parcs holidays during school holidays was shared 143,000 times in Facebook. But while officials can do little about companies choosing to raise prices to make the most of spikes in demand, the sweetheart deals between hotel chains and online resellers could have fallen foul of the Competition Act. The OFT investigation into the issue was triggered four years ago by British businessman, Dorian Harris, the founder of the discount rooms website Skoosh.com, who complained rivals tried to put him out of business because he undercut their prices. He said: ‘We started getting some calls from angry and confused hoteliers insisting that we were selling their rooms too cheaply. ‘I realised a website had been on to them threatening all sorts of nonsense if they didn’t either remove their hotel from Skoosh or force Skoosh to raise its prices.’ He added: ‘I had hotels calling me and emailing me to raise my prices. I found out that other hotel booking websites were then also tipping off the hotels about my prices. ‘Soon I found the wholesalers who provided me with rooms stopped working with me. I would say that I lost about 70 per cent of my business.’ The Crowne Plaza in Bloomsbury: Booking.com and Expedia each entered into separate agreements with the chain which restricted their ability to discount the rate at which room bookings were offered . Mr Harris, feels the changes announced by the OFT do not go far enough. The German authorities are about to outlaw any price agreements between hotels and travel agents. He warned the deal signed by the hotel groups and travel agents only runs for two years. ‘I really can’t see these proposals will offer any meaningful savings. We should just have a free market in hotel rooms where prices are clear,’ he said. OFT senior director, Ann Pope, insisted that consumers will see benefits. ‘The travel industry, fuelled by the internet, has seen significant changes in recent years, and we want to ensure those changes continue to work in consumers’ interests,’ she said. ‘That is why we are pleased to have secured this outcome which, by allowing OTAs and hotels to offer discounts, should increase competition and mean travellers across Europe can benefit from reductions on hotel accommodation throughout the UK. ‘By shopping around, people can compare the different discounts offered by hotels and OTAs, and ensure they get the best deal.’","Hotels and websites had agreed to cap discounts, OFT found .

"By . Tara Brady . A man killed the mother of his child and her two cousins then shot himself dead in front of police officers after handing a 13-month-old boy to them. Brittany Mills, 28, had been trying to break off her relationship with John Louis Lynn, 41, when he came round to her home at Dye House Apartments, in the Hartford suburb of Manchester, Connecticut, on Saturday. After growing concerned that Miss Mills wasn't answering her phone her two cousins Kamesha Mills, 23, and Artara Benson, 46, went round the the apartment to check on her. But at 9.40pm police were called to the property after reports of multiple gunshots. As they arrived at the scene Lynn emerged from the building carrying the child, according to a statement by Manchester police Captain Christopher Davis. Breaking up: Brittany Mills, pictured, was trying to end her relationship with the father of her young son, John Louis Lynn, when he shot her . During a brief confrontation with officers, he put down the boy before shooting himself, the officer said. The child appeared to be unharmed but was taken to a hospital to be examined. An officer also fired one shot at the man but apparently missed, Davis said. Police then searched the building and found a gruesome scene. Brittany Mills had been shot multiple times while her cousins Kamesha and Artara were both killed with a single gunshot wound to the head. Gunned down: Brittany Mill's cousin Artara Benson, 46, was killed by Lynn . Concerned relative: Kamesha Mills, another of Brittany's cousins, was also shot dead . A member of the Mills family told The Hartford Courant that Brittany had been trying to end her relationship with Lynn for two weeks but that he was ''over there all the time'', even though she ''tried to stop him coming''. The couple were also involved in a child support dispute and Lynn had been ordered to pay support by a Superior Court judge. Brittany had also filed a contempt finding and wage garnishment against Lynn. Mills' sister Tashua Parker said the couple had a strained relationship, but that it had not been violent. She said; ''It wasn't physical, we just never thought it would go this far.'' Killer: John Lynn shot dead his girlfriend and her two cousins before turning the gun on himself . When police arrived at the scene they . had to force entry into the apartment and found all three women shot . dead in the living room. Captain Davis said that the prompt arrival of the police prevented Lynn from abducting his son after the triple homicide. He . said:: 'It should be noted that the officers' quick response to the . scene prevented the suspect from being able to flee with the child and . likely saved the child's life.' Sandra Murray, a resident in the . complex, said she was watching television when she was startled by what . sounded like two gunshots. She looked out her window and saw police officers arriving. She said: 'It's sad. It's horrible this has happened. 'Everyone is so sad around here, just trying to figure out what happened. You're just praying for the families.' She said authorities removed the bodies from the apartment at about 6am yesterday. The medical examiner determined that Lynn's death was a suicide while Brittany, Kamesha and Artara were all homicde victims. The apartments are in a converted industrial mill complex about 10 miles east of Hartford, near Interstate 384.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Different reality: Andrew Firestone  married Ivana Bozilovic in 2008. The couple has two children . As he appears to leave reality TV behind him, former Bachelor star Andrew Firestone is now looking to politics - and handing a rose to Mitt Romney. Firestone, 37, of Santa Barbara, has latched on to the California delegation that will formally nominate Romney as the Republican candidate for president on Tuesday. Attending the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida, Firestone says that he’s hoping Romney will present solutions for the issues affecting America. He told the Sacramento Bee: ‘I don't think anybody denies that this country is going in the wrong direction and we want a plan. Firestone, now a married father of two, says he has come to Tampa hoping Romney will motivate Republicans. He said: 'We want a direct idea of how it's going to be put into place to get us going in the right direction. Firestone added: 'Politics are participatory and not just by the elected officials but by the private sector as well and being able to have their voice heard and being able to participate in the process.' The winery owner says he likens the rigors of the campaign trail to competing in a dating reality show, but says there is one key difference. He told the Bee: 'I think probably the difference between politics and 'The Bachelor' is the fact that the candidates I think in 'The Bachelor' are a lot better looking.' Backing: Firestone is attending the Republican National Convention in Tampa, where Mitt Romney is expected to be formally nominated on Wednesday . He added: 'But probably just as stressful as well.' Contestant: Firestone took part in the third series of The Bachelor in April 2003, when he courted 25 women . Firestone is not the first of his namesake to enter the Republican fray. His dad, former Assemblyman Brooks Firestone, was an avid supporter of Bob Dole, who ran an unsuccessful campaign to unseat Bill Clinton from the White House in 1996, according to KEYT. Firestone took part in the third series of ABC show The Bachelor in April 2003, when he courted 25 women. He eventually picked Jen Schefft and proposed to her, but they split that December. Firestone went on to marry actress and model Ivana Bozilovic in 2008. The couple has two children. Post-Bachelor, Firestone has also appeared on such TV shows as Iron Chef America, Celebrity Poker Showdown, and Celebrity Paranormal Project. His grandfather, Harvey Firestone, is the founder of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company.","Firestone comes to Florida in first appearance as a political delegate .

"If you're looking for a bargain break, you should head to Bulgaria, but avoid Italy, according to the latest research. A basket of 10 typical holiday spending items, including evening meals and drinks, cost just £43 in Sunny Beach in Bulgaria, according to a Post Office travel money survey. But buy the same items in Tuscany or Sorrento and you'll end up spending more than £100. However, the picture across Europe is positive overall, with price drops of up to 21 per cent in two-thirds of resorts on the Continent. Balmy Bulgaria: Sunny Beach offers the best value for money for British travellers . Italian idyll: Sorrento is a favourite destination among the rich and famous, but it is pricey . If Bulgaria isn't your cup of tea, then Marmaris, in Turkey, was found to be the second most inexpensive destination, with the items setting holidaymakers back just £54. Spain's Costa del Sol and Costa Blanca areas were also good value for money, as was the Portuguese Algarve and Paphos in Cyprus where prices have plunged 21 per cent in the last 12 months. While Italy came out as the most expensive destination, the Balearic party island of Ibiza wasn't far behind, where the basket of items was £97, with travellers to Nice in France also having to splash out, parting with £96. The basket of items included small items such as a bottle of water, a cup of coffee and suncream, along with lunch for two and a three-course evening meal.

And just over half (51 per cent) have already booked their first trip. Nearly a third of them (30 per cent) have also booked their second holiday, most commonly for travel in September. Almost two-thirds of those planning trips rate overseas holidays as important in their lives  – and nearly half say that poor UK weather is a key factor in their decision-making.","Prices fall up to 21 per cent in two-thirds of European resorts .

"By . Paul Revoir . Fed-up viewers have told the BBC to stop moving events from channel to channel, saying it is wearing them out trying to keep up. Some sports such as the cycling road races and gymnastics have been switched from BBC1 to other channels, such as BBC3, or viewers have been redirected to one of the corporation’s 24 dedicated Olympics channels. Critics claim that once the broadcaster starts showing a sport on a channel, it should stick with it. Switch-over: Gymnastics has been one of several events where viewers have been asked to change channel to continue watching mid-way through the excitement . Others admitted they had not realised the sport they had been watching had been switched and they ended up missing large chunks of it. The BBC is operating 24 dedicated channels showing all the action from every event on satellite and cable. But many viewers access the coverage through the two main channels – BBC1 and BBC3 – which have been changing events in the middle of the coverage. One viewer wrote on the BBC’s message-board: ‘I’m trying to watch the bike race here! It started on BBC 1, moved to BBC 3 and now is moved to the Red Button! ‘Stop doing that! I feel like I’m participating in the Olympics, chasing after the TV channel.’ Another said: ‘This is becoming a nasty habit with the BBC and I absolutely hate it! It’s like watching a TV with your kid in charge of the remote.’ Others took to Twitter to complain. One sports fan tweeted: ‘Ughhh, was streaming the gymnastics on BBC1 and it switched to BBC3 and the stream I have for that doesn’t work.’ Another added: ‘Didn’t realise gymnastics switched to BBC3, been watching horse riding for about 20 minutes.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘Every event is live and uninterrupted on the BBC’s 24 Olympic channels, which have proved enormously popular and are being watched by millions. ‘On BBC1 and BBC3, we go to the best of the action, which occasionally means we will switch events between channels. ‘But this is the first time people can use the red button to find full live coverage of anything they choose and that can also be recorded.’","Critics claim once broadcaster starts showing event, it should stay on same channel .

"By . Mark Prigg . It is one of the first pictures showing Apple's expected new iPhone family in one place. These images reveal two new model, one with a 4.7inch screen and one with a 5.5inch screen. The devices are expected to be revealed in September- and go on sale soon after. Scroll down for video . An image last week, also leaked by Sonny Dickson, revealed the two new iPhone 6 models side-by-side . The leak is particularly trustworthy as it comes from Sonny Dickson, the same Australian blogger who leaked last year's iPhone 5S. The photos are believed to be mockups of the handset used so case manufacturers can prepare new products that fit the handset correctly. They appear to confirm the handset will have a larger 4.7inch screen, and that Apple has moved the power button to allow the handset to be operated easily with one hand. Production of the handsets is believed to already be underway in China. The new images also reveal apple will continue to offer a gold version of the handset . Last week pictures of Apple's smaller iPhone 6 were revealed, showing the handset side by side with the current iPhone. The leak came from former Taiwanese pop star Jimmy Lin who also leaked the iPhone 5 and the iPad Mini ahead of their releases. Leaked shots of what appears to be the iPhone 6 is shown next to the current 5S. It has a 4.7-inch (11.9 centimetres) screen, according to reports, and is likely to be announced in September . The iPhone 6 (left) has the same fingerprint sensor as the 5S (right), but is noticeably larger . According to Lin, the iPhone 6 comes with a 4.7-inch display, more rounded than the previous models. He described the device as being 'very grippy' in the hand. The device also has a headphone socket - despite recent rumours Apple could abandon a dedicated socket and instead use the lightning connector currently used for charging. The leaks are the latest to hit Apple, all  showing an identical, slimline design. However, Apple has not commented on the pictures. Former Taiwanese pop star Jimmy Lin who also leaked the iPhone 5 and the iPad Mini ahead of their releases, shown with the iPhone 6 shell (right) New shots of the rumoured iPhone 6 have been revealed ahead of an expected launch in August or September this year. Other recent images, republished by nowhereelse.fr, are similar to ones leaked before and lend credibility to claims this is what the next device will look like. The latest photos show that the tentatively named iPhone 6 will be made from metal, and will also be much thinner than Apple's current range of devices. Rumours suggest Apple is working on two versions of different sizes, with one being 4.7 inches (11.9cm) diagonally, the same size as the HTC One. Latest images of Apple's supposed iPhone 6 were leaked last month (shown), showing a phone with an ultra-thin design and rounded images. The power button, typically found on the top of previous iPhones, appears to have been moved to the side, making the device easier to operate with one hand . A larger version is also expected to be released, measuring 5.5 inches (14cm) - slightly larger than Samsung's 5.1-inch Galaxy S5. In the images some changes to button placement can also be seen. The power button, usually found on the top of iPhones for example, appears to be located on the side of the device. The volume and lock buttons, however, will seemingly remain where they are. Look familiar? The rumoured back of Apple’s new iPhone 6 looks similar to that of the HTC One (pictured right) with a horizontal line at the top and bottom and curved edges. It also suggests Apple may have found a way to make its 'True Tone' flash technology smaller as the whole is different to an iPhone 5S . Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version. Up . until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest . phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 0.24 inches (6.18 . millimetres). This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 0.23 inches (5.75 millimetres). By . comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 0.3 inches (7.6 . millimetres), while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 0.295 inches . (7.5 millimetres). Samsung's Galaxy S4 is 0.31 inches (7.9 millimetres) thick, while the HTC One is 0.37 inches (9.3 millimetres). It is believed the iPhone 6, which some think will go by the name of the iPhone Air, will sport a 1704 x 960 resolution display, and a powerful A8 processor. The iPhone 5s, by comparison, has a 1136 x 640 resolution, and the A7 chip. These hardware changes will be in addition to the features of Apple's latest iOS 8 software, unveiled last week, which include health monitors and smart notifications. This latest in a long line of leaks comes as Apple chief executive Tim Cook and senior vice president of Internet Software and Services, Eddy Cue, visited Apple’s new campus in Austin, Texas. During the tour, the pair told employees to prepare for the ‘exciting products’ the company has lined up for this year. This was previously teased in an email from Cook to employees in Christmas last year. These products could include Apple’s rumoured smartwatch and the iPhone Air. Australian blog MacFixit claims this is the rear case of the iPhone 6. As well as environmental readings, the rumoured sensors would improve the accuracy and speed of the phone's location services . In May, Australian blog MacFixit said: 'We have just received from our contact in China a photo of what seems to be the back of an iPhone 6. 'We believe the picture to be genuine as we have received leaked product pics in the past that have also proven to be legitimate after official Apple product launches.' German phone firm Deutsche Telekom then began telling customers Apple's iPhone 6 will launch on 19 September. The operator told call centre representatives to let customers know the date in a bid to stop them swapping operators, it has been claimed by apfelpage.de. Users of iPhone 6 could have sensors to track altitude, weather and even air pressure, according to code hidden in the iOS 8 operating system. This image is a screen grab from a video created by French site nowhereelse.fr. It features what is believed to be an industrial model of the iPhone 6 handset . According to Apple Insider, however, the date could be little more than an informed guess. 'The date is consistent with Apple's recent launches, making it likely an educated guess,' it said. Apple historically launches its new iPhone models on Fridays, and 19 September does fall on a Friday this year. Apple also began selling its latest smartphones during the same week last year, as the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c both became available on 20 September. In 2012 Apple made the iPhone 5 available on 21 September. Prior to that, the iPhone 4S launched a few weeks later, on 14 October 2011. Leaked images (pictured) and reports about Apple's next flagship phone - dubbed iPhone 6 - have been circulating since last year. If the rumours turn out to be true, the iPhone 6 will have a rounded, thinner design and a larger screen . French site nowhereelse.fr recently posted a video of a 'dummy' handset. It was made using an industrial model of the handset believed to have been made to help case and accessory makers ensure their products fit the new design. Taiwanese media then reported supply-chain sources similarly claiming a 4.7-inch screen version of the iPhone 6 will reach stores in August, with a 5.5-inch or 5.6-inch model released in September. However, the Economic Daily News did not say which markets would receive the phone first.","Images show 4.7 and 5.5inch handsets nest to each other .

"By . Emma Innes . A mother-of-two has a sleep condition which means she has fallen asleep next to loud speakers, on the back of a moped and even on the bus holding her newborn baby. Claire Metters, 38, from Conwy, North Wales, says she suffers with narcolepsy and faces a daily battle to stay awake for her children. She claims she must nap for four hours a day, on top of getting nine hours sleep at night, in order to function. Claire Metters, 38, has the sleep condition narcolepsy which means she faces a daily battle to stay awake for her children - Lucie, seven (right), and Aimee, 12 (left) Ms Metters said: ‘If I didn’t take my naps when the girls are at school I would fall asleep cooking them dinner, or tidying up.’ Ms Metters is no longer able to drive or work, as her body is too worn out and constantly needs to rest. Her day starts at 7am when she wakes up and helps her daughters Lucie, seven, and Aimee, 12, get ready for school. Claire then walks her younger daughter to the nearby school for 9am and by 9.30am she is back in bed, taking the first of her scheduled naps. She wakes herself up again at 11am and will go about her day, doing the housework, preparing food and supporting the charity Narcolepsy UK charity. By 1pm Ms Metters is ready to head back to bed for her next two-hour nap, and she sleeps until 3pm when she picks up Lucie from school. Ms Metters, who had to give up work because of her illness, has to nap for two hours in the morning and two hours in the afternoon to ensure she is awake for her children before and after school . For years doctors told Ms Metters that her symptoms were caused by stress before she was eventually diagnosed with narcolepsy after Aimee's birth . Ms Metters says she suffers with narcolepsy, a neurological condition which means although she sleeps a lot, she doesn’t get the restful sleep she needs during the night and as a result suffers constant nightmares, hallucinations and sleep paralysis. She said: ‘I have a very different sleep pattern to other people and can wake up to 15 times a night, so I don’t get the restorative sleep I need. ‘I get terrible nightmares and hallucinations which are triggered by things I have seen in the news or online - I slip straight back into dream sleep while drifting off which means I am unable to stop myself going back into the nightmare. 7am - Wake up, have breakfast, get the children ready for school . 9am - Walk Lucie to school . 9.30am - Go back to bed for the first nap . 11.30am - Wake up from nap, continue with day including doing housework . 1pm - Go back to bed for afternoon nap . 3pm - Wake up from nap . 3.30pm - Pick up Lucie from school . 3.30pm - 10pm - Prepare dinner for the children, enjoy the evening together . 10pm - Go to bed . ‘I also have hallucinations where I hear intruders coming into my home. ‘It’s exhausting and incredibly emotionally draining.’ She added: ‘I want to be the best parent I can be for my children so I have found that taking strategic naps during the day is the only way I can keep my sleeping under control.’ Ms Metters first started to notice her symptoms of hallucinations, nightmares and extreme tiredness when she was 13 years old, but her symptoms were mild and didn’t become a serious problem until she was 26. She found herself falling asleep in public and in places which could have been dangerous - like on the back a moped while on a summer holiday in Greece. She said: ‘I was that tired on the holiday that I closed my eyes sitting on the back of the bike and actually nodded off straight to sleep.’ Ms Metters got to the stage where she was unable to control her sleeping during the day had to take naps in laybys while driving to work. She said: ‘In the past I found that despite loud music, bumpy roads and being in public my tiredness could not be stopped and before I managed my condition I could sleep anywhere.’ Before she learned to control her condition, Ms Metters fell asleep on a moped and also on the bus while holding Aimee as a new-born baby . Ms Metters suffers nightmares and hallucinations at night meaning she does not sleep well. This causes her to be exhausted during the day and leaves her at risk of falling asleep in inappropriate places . The breaking point came for Ms Metters when she became a mother. She . said: ‘A few weeks after I had given birth to my eldest daughter I was . sat on the bus and I found myself repeatedly nodding off, while trying . to hold my new-born baby. ‘This was when I realised I could no longer hide from my tiredness and my doctors needed to take my complaints seriously.’ Narcolepsy, which occurs in one in every 2,000 people, is a sleep disorder that causes a person to suddenly fall asleep at inappropriate times. It is a long-term neurological condition that disrupts normal sleeping patterns. Symptoms include, sleep attacks, daytime sleepiness, nightmares, hallucinations and cataplexy - temporary muscle weakness in response to emotion. It is often caused by an autoimmune response - this is when antibodies are released by the body but instead of destroying disease, they attack healthy cells. In the case of narcolepsy, antibodies attack the areas of the brain that produce a sleep-regulating chemical. There is currently no cure but the condition can sometimes be managed, for example, by taking regular naps, eating healthily and exercising. In some cases, medications such as antidepressants or stimulants can also help. For 12 years she was constantly told . by doctors that it was just stress was making her tired but when she was . finally diagnosed she was relieved. She . also suffers from cataplexy which means she loses control of her neck . and leg muscles at moments of extreme emotion, such as if she is in pain . or laughing hard. She manages to control this with medication, but unfortunately hasn’t managed to find an effective medication for her narcolepsy - which is why she must stick religiously to her napping routine. Before she was diagnosed, Ms Metters would resort to extreme measures to try and keep herself awake, including taking layers off to stay cold, sitting on the most uncomfortable seat available and even physically hurting herself. She said: ‘I would make excuses to go to the toilet and then slap my face, and splash myself with water to try and wake up. ‘I would pinch my skin really hard to try and try to use the pain to keep me awake.’ When she finally gained the courage to explain the severity of her narcolepsy to her friends, family and children’s school she was pleased with the support she received. However, she says there were a few people who assumed her condition made her a less attentive mother - something she fiercely rejects. She has now worked out a routine which works for her family. She will save what she calls ‘screen time’ for time when she needs to rest, letting her children watch television, play on the laptop, or watch a DVD while she sleeps. Ms Metters worries that some people think her condition makes her a less attentive mother but says she is still dedicated to her children and that she does not allow her illness to get her down . She said: ‘I do have guilt about finding . time to rest when my children are in my care. I never wanted my . children to have to occupy themselves. ‘But I also have to look after me- I have to rest and not step outside my limitations so I can be a good mother.’ She joked: ‘The children have become wise to it now. They tell me I look tired and ask if I want a nap just so they can have a go on the computer!’ She added: ‘Although I am more tired than other people, I haven’t let it get me down and I am still dedicated to my children and determined to enjoy life.’","Claire Metters has narcolepsy, a condition that effects sleep-wake cycles .

"By . Sam Webb . This is the moment an escaped monkey was apparently photographed on the loose in a public park. The hairy black creature was spotted by stunned Terri Leigh Cox as she looked out of her bedroom window that overlooks the play park in Dorchester, Dorset. She witnessed the animal hunched over and bounding around on all fours before she grabbed her mobile phone and took a single frame of it. Miss Cox, 17, said the creature then scampered up a tree and out of sight. A student spotted what she thinks was a monkey wandering around her local park in Dorchester, Dorset . Her boyfriend Shaun Bessant dashed out a few minutes later to look for the monkey-like creature but found no sign of it. Miss Cox spotted the beast about 100 yards away from her home. The park is about 10 miles away from the famous Monkey World attraction in Wool, although staff there have not reported any lost primates. Terri Leigh Cox, 17, took a quick snap of the 'primate' shortly before it scampered up a tree and out of sight . She said she is certain the mysterious animal was not a dog or cat and believes it was a monkey that may be an escaped pet. 'It was such a shock I couldn't believe what I was seeing at first,' the health and social care student said. Miss Cox said: 'It looked about the size of a silver back gorilla. It was ambling like one as well, on its arms and feet' 'It looked about the size of a small gorilla. It was walking like one as well, using its arms and feet. 'It was definitely a monkey because you could tell by its hunched back and the way it scampered across the field and up the tree. It wasn't a black dog. 'I managed to get a photo but it quickly went out of sight. I couldn't see it very clearly. 'When I tried to get another shot it had disappeared. 'I have no idea what the monkey was doing there. It could have escaped if someone was keeping it as a pet.' A spokeswoman for Monkey World said all of its monkeys and apes were accounted for. She said: 'The image is not clear and it is difficult to make out, so we would be unable to confirm its identity. 'I can confirm that all of our rescued monkeys and apes are safe and well in the park.' Many residents and dog walkers at the park have expressed their shock at the sighting. Derek Dodd said: 'I have seen a lot of wildlife on these fields but a monkey-like creature isn't one of them.' Rob Samways, who lives nearby, said: 'I'll be keeping my eyes peeled from now. I supposed somebody could have been keeping it as a pet and it has escaped.' Have you seen the Dorchester ape?  If so, please email harriet.arkell@mailonline.co.uk . Wrapped up warm: Darwin the macaque had his coat on for his shopping trip . Last December, shoppers at Ikea in Toronto were surprised to see a stylishly dressed monkey roaming around the carpark unaccompanied. Darwin the Japanese macacque monkey, who was wrapped up warmly in a shearling coat and nappy, ambled about the homeware store, posing for photographs by bemused Christmas shoppers, before he was caught by animal welfare authorites. It later transpired he had escaped from owner Yasmin Nakhuda who then faced a fierce custody battle with local animal care authorities to get her pet back. Teddy Bear the cat, aka the Essex Lion . Last August, the residents of Clacton on Sea in Essex locked themselves indoors in a panic after it was reported that a large lion was prowling through a nearby stubble field. Armed officers and two police helicopters using heat-seeking equipment, which cost £880 an hour to run, were scrambled in a bid to track down the wild animal. Workers from nearby Colchester Zoo carrying tranquilliser guns scoured the fields and residents were warned to stay indoors. Caravanners were temporarily moved to a nearby garden centre. However when 50-year-old fitness instructor Ginny Murphie saw the blurry images of the wild beast on the news, she realised that it was in fact her fluffy pet cat, Teddy Bear. Mrs Murphie, who was away from her St Osyth home in Essex at the time, said: 'I knew straightaway it was Teddy, he's been mistaken for a fox before.'","Student Terri Leigh Cox saw mystery beast in a park near her home .

"By . Steve Nolan . 'Saddened': Shopper Simon Wightman who is angry that Iceland supermarket is selling meat in security boxes to prevent theft . Cheese and meat joints have been locked away in security-sealed boxes by a crime-hit supermarket in a bid to thwart hungry thieves. Crime-hit supermarket chain Iceland has resorted to using the 'lamb saver boxes', normally used to protect more expensive goods such as CDs, games and DVDs, which trigger an alarm if a shoplifter attempts to leave the store with meat products without paying. The security tactic has been employed in hundreds of the chain's stores across the UK. Checkout assistants at the stores have told customers the supermarket chain also plans to fix security tags to its cheese - or lock the dairy goods away from reach. Iceland bosses said they had been forced into the 'defence mechanisms' to stop a growing number of hungry thieves pinching its stock. But customers hit out at the precaution, while food charities interpreted the measure as 'inevitable' with many families struggling to make ends meet. Shopper Simon Wightman said he was 'saddened' to to find the leg-of-lamb contained in security tagged boxes when he was doing a weekly shop. The motorcycle store manager and father-of-three from Herne Bay, Kent, said: 'I just think it is sad that people feel they have to steal from Iceland to survive. 'What is the world coming to? When I saw them I couldn’t believe it. 'Someone trying to swipe something expensive from Marks & Spencer you can almost understand, but pinching meat from Iceland? 'What will they do next, an electric fence around the fish fingers? Scroll down for video . Security conscious: Supermarket chain Iceland has rolled out the security measures across hundreds of stores (file picture) 'When I laughed at the boxes, the woman at the check out even said they were planning to security tag cheese. 'Apparently so many people steal it, they stuff it into their trousers and run out - its ridiculous. 'You can understand them wanting the boxes because even when their security guards catch someone they can’t sell the food if its been stuffed down someone’s pants.' Iceland, which like most food stores already fixes security tags to luxury items, such as expensive spirits, said its new measures were needed to maximise 'availability.' Stop thief: Hungry shoplifters won't be stealing these lamb joints in a hurry, they are encased in a security box . Spokeswoman for the chain Amy Globe, said: 'The lamb saver boxes are used in several hundred Iceland stores and are designed to enhance the availability of the product for customers. 'The boxes are designed to serve as a defence mechanism to reduce theft and thereby ensure there is maximum availability for customers. She confirmed that the chain had been 'trialing' security boxes for bacon and cheese in some of their UK stores. She said: 'The trial was run across some of our UK stores but didn’t prove as effective as the lamb saver boxes. 'Lamb was our most targeted item as it is one of the most costly and popular items in store. 'Therefore we have seen a dramatic reduction in theft since the boxes have been introduced. 'The security boxes weren’t as noticibly effective on lesser items such as bacon and cheese therefore we are unable to confirm they will remain a permanent fixture in stores.' Food charities said they had seen the need for food banks in certain areas of Britain double in the last year. The Trussell Trust, part of the UK food bank network, said they weren’t shocked to see a rise in theft from the Iceland store, claiming some families are 'desperate' for food. Some of the charity’s individual branches have reported more than a 30 per cent increase in people using food banks since the UK was hit by recession in 2009. More than 200,000 people across Britain are now known to be signed-up to food banks to feed their families. Trussell Trust spokeswoman Molly Hodson said: 'Parents will often go days without eating so they can feed their children but when they are faced with not being able to feed their two-year-old of course they turn to desperate measures. 'Food banks are based in towns and cities across the country but we still don’t have enough and that is the worrying thing. 'Families in the UK are struggling - the food banks are here to help and hopefully there for people so they don’t have to resort to stealing.'","Supermarket chain Iceland says that it has been forced into 'defence mechanisms' by growing number of shoplifters .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Grainy satellite images have given fresh hope to the families of seven crew members missing after they sailed into a storm off New Zealand in June. When the official search for the crew of the Nina, including American David Dyche, his wife Rosemary and their 17-year-old son David, was called off in July relatives enlisted a private rescue team. Private company Texas EquuSearch spotted what appears to be the 85-year-old wooden schooner drifting about 184 nautical miles off the coast of Norfolk island, near New Zealand on September 15. They are now trying to plot its course before doing an aerial search. Hope: A private rescue company has spotted what could be the Nina drifting in the Tasman sea . Lost at sea: This 85-year-old boat Nina has been missing since a storm off New Zealand in June . 'This is what we've been waiting for,' said Robin Wright, whose 19-year-old daughter Danielle is one of the six Americans and one Briton missing. Her husband, Ricky, told ABC knowing their only child was lost at sea was  'a nightmare I can't wake up out of'. Despite the satellite image appearing to show a vessel the same size and shape as the historic 85-year-old Nina, New Zealand authorities have so far refused to relaunch an active search for the crew. Officials told the New Zealand Herald they would need better quality images before resuming the search for the Dyche family, Danielle, 73-year-old Evi Nemreth, 27-year-old Kyle Jackson, and 35-year-old Briton Matthew Wootton. Match: This satellite image taken on September 15 shows an object matching engineering drawings of missing schooner Nina, right . Lost: The crew of the Nina are all experienced sailors who have good survival skills, relatives have said . Mr Wootton, a Green Party activist who refuses to fly for environmental reasons, was on the final leg of a three-year round-the-world trip when he boarded the yacht in Opua, on New Zealand’s North Island, on May 29. His father Ian, who lives with his wife Sue in Orpington, Kent, said they had mixed emotions about the new images. He told the New Zealand Herald: 'You get the elation of yep, this looks like a really good image. But also the downside of: How are you going to find it again?' A MetService spokesman said weather . patterns since the image was taken on September 15 would need to be . traced so gauge where the schooner may have drifted to. Once the direction of the object pictured in the image is determined, private pilots will be hired to do an aerial search. Missing: From left, David Dyche, Kyle Jackson, Evi Nemreth, Matthew Wooten, David Dyche Jr, Danielle Wright and Rosemary Dyche . Families . of the missing crew have been left frustrated at the slow response from . New Zealand authorities to the new information. '[Authorities] have never said that the Nina has definitely sunk,' said Ian Wootten, whose 35-year-old son Matthew is missing. 'We . feel they are not going to be convinced by a satellite photo until they . can see seven people holding their passports up,' he added. 'We can provide them with the data and say this is what the Nina looks like - you can see it's the same shape as the image. They have to be prepared to have a look at it,' Mr Wooten said. The last contact anyone had with the Nina's crew was a text message sent by environmental scientist Ms Nemreth which wasn't received until nearly a month after she sent it on June 4. It read: 'Thanks storm sails shredded . last night, now bare poles. Goining 4kt 310deg will update course info . (at) 6PM'. The crew had left New Zealand for Australia six days before their boat, which was built in 1928, went missing. Voyage: The crew of Nina were attempting to sail from New Zealand to Australia . Adrift: The search for the missing schooner, which left Opua in May, has centered on the Tasman sea . The crew of the Nina, a 70ft schooner, were sailing from Opua in New Zealand to Newcastle in Australia. On board were six Americans and one Briton. Six days into their voyage, on June 4, the crew sailed into a storm, which shredded their sails. A text message sent on June 4 suggested the sailors had weathered the storm. New Zealand authorities called off the official search on July 4. On September 15, a private search company hired by relatives spotted an object on a satellite image believed to be the NIna. The missing crew are Captain David Dyche, 58, from Panama City, Florida; David's 60-year-old wife, Rosemary and their 17-year-old son David Jr. Also on board is Kyle Jackson, a 27-year-old from Bassett, Nebraska; Evi Nemeth, a 71-year-old from Boulder Colorado; Danielle Wright, a 19-year-old student from Baton Rouge, Lousiana; Matthew Wooten, a 35-year-old environmentalist from the UK. Authorities believe the . Nina likely sank in a storm on the day the text message was sent. They . continued their search until July in the hope survivors may have made it . on to a life raft or to land. The ship had been 370 miles off Cape Reinga when the crew encountered a storm with 68mph winds and 26ft swells. The boat's captain Mr Dyche, from Florida, was an experienced sailor who had completed transatlantic journeys in the past. Despite her young age, Louisiana psychology student Danielle has also sailed a lot, spending two years at sea in the Caribbean with her parents when she was 16. Everyone on board is said to be experienced in survival, giving hope that they may be alive and drifting in the Tasman sea, awaiting rescue. Nigel . Clifford, Maritime New Zealand's general manager of safety and response . services, said earlier this year that the text message indicated the Nina's crew would update their position . about six hours later. But it was the last confirmed contact from the schooner. 'While . it shows that Nina had survived the storm up to that point, very poor . weather continued in the area for many hours and has been followed by . other storms,' Mr Clifford said in a statement. Authorities . didn't state why the text message went undelivered. Seafarers: Captain David Dyche, right, is an experienced sailor who was joined on the voyage by his wife Rosemary, left, and son David, center . Leaving a trail: The Dyches and their crew sailed into a storm. A text from fellow crew member Evi Nemeth, right, also raised hopes that the sailors survived the bad weather and are awaiting rescue . Mrs Wright said: 'We . have never lost hope that the crew of Nina is alive and well and that . they will be rescued, but seeing that boat image is very exciting. It's . not a perfect system, but it's all we have at the moment.' The families of those on board have a Facebook page and Go Fund Me website to help raise funds to continue their private search. 'Private . searching costs run between $10,000-$20,000 per day, and there's still a . lot of area that needs to be covered,' Mrs Wright wrote on a page dedicated to finding Danielle.

"By . Rachel Reilly . Men may think it is the height of fashion, but the trend of wearing loafers without socks could leave them with fungus-infested feet, experts are warning. The look, favoured by the likes of Ryan Gosling and Jude Law, is causing  a dramatic rise in cases of bad foot odour and cases of athlete’s foot. Recent statistics have shown that sales of products to remedy the embarrassing problems have shot up by over ten per cent. Kicking up a stink?: Hollywood stars including Ryan Gosling (left) and Jude law (right) have pioneered the unhygienic trend that is causing men to complain of itchy, smelly feet . Not wearing socks causes sweat to seep directly into the shoe's . leather, which turns the inside of the shoe into a breeding ground for bacteria. This, combined with high moisture levels, creates a bad smell and in many cases triggers the itchy fungal infection known as athlete's foot. Online pharmacy Chemist Direct has reported a surge in sales of foot deodorants and perfumed insole to mask unpleasant shoe smells. Pharmacist Omar El-Gohary says that his team have received a steady flow of enquiries from customers over the past month asking about how they can minimise foot odour when wearing shoes without socks. ‘While traditionally we always see a spike in sales as the summer foot ware season begins, the latest fashions often affect demand for certain treatments, he said. As the feet contain more sweat glands than anywhere else in the body, this makes them more prone to sweating. But experts say there are a number of ways to prevent this. Fashion faux pas: Men who are following the trend are giving themselves smelly, fungus-infested feet. Pharmacists say that to prevent odour developing it is important to alternate shoes so the sweat can dry out . Mr El-Gohary explains: ‘Wearing the right socks can help absorb sweat and keep the feet dry. 'People should use cotton over nylon, and make sure these are changed daily to avoid a build-up of bacteria. ‘Try alternating between different shoes daily to ensure that they have ample time to dry off in between use. He added: ‘If you still have problems consider using a deodorant on feet, a foot spray, or medicated deodorising insoles. 'Treating the feet with an antibacterial wash for a few minutes twice a day can also help.’","The fashionable look has been sported by Jude Law and Ryan Gosling .

"By . Harriet Arkell . The story of the ferocious but lovable great aunt upon whom the character of Mary Poppins was based is to be told in print for the first time. Christina Saraset, known as Aunt Sass, was credited with being the inspiration for the magical nanny created by her niece, Mary Poppins author PL Travers. Described by Travers as a 'bulldog with a ferocious exterior' but with a 'heart tender to the point of sentimentality', she was a strong, no-nonsense presence in her niece's life, as well as her work. Until now, little has been known about the woman who inspired the world's best-loved nanny, but a publisher with a nose for a story has discovered a barely-known short story about the author's great aunt. Much loved story: Mary Poppins, played in the 1964 film by Julie Andrews, had real-life inspiration . PL Travers, who based Mary Poppins on her irascible but lovable Aunt Sass, wrote a short story about her . Virago's Donna Coonan was hunting for any unpublished work by Travers when she came across a short, semi-autobiographical story, entitled Aunt Sass, that Travers had written in 1941 about her aunt, whose real name was Helen Morehead. Ms Coonan said: 'I read it but I wasn't expecting much.  I thought it might be too personal, or just not very good, but it completely blew me away. 'I laughed, I cried - it was moving, funny, tender, and a really, really lovely story.' In the book, Travers described the fierce great aunt with a heart of gold tenderly, saying: 'Her remarkableness lay in the extraordinary and, to me, enchanting discrepancy between her external behaviour and her inner self.' It tells how the author heard about her great aunt's death, saying: 'I thought to myself ""Some day, in spite of her, I shall commit the 'disrespectful vulgarity' of putting Aunt Sass in a book"". 'And then it occurred to me that this had already been done, though unconsciously and without intent. 'We write more than we know we are writing.  We do not guess at the roots that made our fruit.  I suddenly realised that there is a book through which Aunt Sass, stern and tender, secret and proud, anonymous and loving, stalks with her silent feet. 'You will find her occasionally in the page of Mary Poppins.' Mary Poppins: It took Walt Disney 14 years (and a lot of money) to persuade Travers to sell him the film rights . All smiles: Travers, right, was so upset with Disney when the film came out (she is pictured with him and Julie Andrews) she stopped him making a sequel and remained cross with him until her death . Julie Andrews and Travers became friends, but the author said the actress was 'directed wrongly' in the film . After writing the 35-page book during World War Two, Travers printed off a few copies and gave them to family and friends for Christmas, but it has never reached a wider audience, til now. Virago now intends to publish the story, along with two others that the author had only ever given to friends, in one edition this November, in time for Christmas. The other stories, which are of similar lengths, are called Ah Wong and Johnny Delaney, and both tell the tales of real-life unlikely heroes who meant a great deal to the young Travers as she grew up in her native Australia. Ms Coonan said: 'Ah Wong is a Chinese cook who chants threats at crying babies - very melodically - to make them sleep, while Johnny Delaney is a heart-breaking but foul-mouthed jockey with a filthy temper.' The trio the stories are based on played important parts in Travers' life growing up on a sugar plantation in Queensland near the Great Barrier Reef. Children's classic: Travers based the character of Mary Poppins on her much-loved but ferocious Aunt Sass . Born Helen Lyndon Goff in 1899, she suffered an impoverished childhood, which inspired her magical stories and characters. Her father was a banker who turned to alcohol, lost all his money and died young - it is widely considered that the character in the Mary Poppins books, Mr Banks, was based on him. As a young woman she was an actress, dancer and a poet before concentrating on fiction.  Ten years after leaving Australia for Britain, with very little money, Travers' first Mary Poppins book was published in 1934 to great acclaim. Walt Disney asked to turn her story into a film, under pressure from his daughters, who loved Mary Poppins, but Travers initially refused. Disney persisted, with letters, telegrams, visits and offers of money, and eventually, after 14 years of bombardment, the author agreed to sell him the film rights for $2million. The resulting film, starring Julie Andrews and Dick van Dyke, was a smash hit when it was released in 1964, but Travers didn't agree.  She sobbed through it when she first saw it, horrified at the sentimentality of the acid-tongued nanny she'd created, Andrews' prettiness which she thought didn't suit her character, and the animated scenes. Travers refused ever to work with Disney again, preventing them from making a much-wanted sequel, and when she died in 1996, aged 96, she was still upset about it. Two years ago the film Saving Mr Banks . was released, telling the story of Travers' dramatic life and her feud . with Walt Disney.  Her great aunt features in the minor role of 'Aunt . Ellie' in the film, played by Rachel Griffiths, mostly in flashbacks.","Mary Poppins author PL Travers based nanny on her real-life great aunt .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Most people don’t think twice about what happens to an email after they press send. Emails seem to appear instantly, but the reality is they often have long and indirect journeys through thousands of miles of cables - and a new program has been designed to help people visualise this arduous journey. Dubbed Email Miles, the email plug-in uses . GPS technology and internet tracking to log where a message was sent and . where it was received. Scroll down for video . Email Miles plug-in uses GPS technology and internet tracking to log where a message was sent and where it was received. This GIF shows the indirect route taken by an email sent from New York to Dakar, which travelled via Chicago, California and Dallas . Email Miles is a free plug-in for email programs such as Apple’s Mail and Google's Gmail. When an email is sent, the location of the server sending the message is tagged into the code of the mail. Email Miles scans an email for this so-called Geolocation tag. Every time an email is received by a new server, the new location tag is added to the email. Brucker-Cohen's plug-in tracks the different server locations of the emails and calculates the distance, in miles, between the two using GPS co-ordinates. The distance is direct, from one point to another, and may not account for the length and shape of the cables it passes through. The nature of email and web traffic means that for emails to travel long distances, it sometimes has to be passed through different servers as it enters and leaves different countries. This is because different companies manage different network cables. Email Miles then adds the location information to emails automatically. It then calculates the total distance between the two and displays it on a monitor. When an email is sent, the location of the server sending the message is tagged into the code of the mail.

'Information is ubiquitous, but the speed and transmission of this information is typically invisible to people who have no conception of the infrastructure involved,' he added. 'The project looks to make those physical locations and separations more tangible and thus to change how people perceive their online communications,' he went on to say. The nature of web traffic means that for emails to travel long distances, they sometimes have to be passed through different servers as they enter and leave countries. This is because different companies manage different cables. Email Miles tracks the server locations and calculates the distance, in miles, between them . After tracking the emails, Email Miles adds the location information and miles to emails automatically, pictured . One of the program's more interesting revelations is how indirect the route of many emails can be. For . example, an email sent from New York to Dakar in Senegal travelled a . total of 12,115 miles - much further than the actual distance between . the two cities. This is . because the email first travelled 790 miles west to Chicago, then . another 2,163 miles west to Mountain View in California. After that it finally started making its way back east - first 1,699 miles to Dallas, then 4,745 miles to London, before eventually heading 2,718 miles south into the West African city. The nature of email and web traffic . means that for emails to travel long distances, it sometimes has to be . passed through different servers as it enters and leaves different . countries. This is because different companies manage different network cables. Brucker-Cohen claims the program does all of its time and distance calculations using the internet and a coordinate mapping system. 'Email Miles is beneficial because it adds a physical component to a phenomenon like email that is perceived as purely virtual,' he said. Brucker-Cohen has set up a FundAnthing campaign to raise money to make the plug-in widely available.","Program allows users to track exact route an email has taken to their inbox .
Emails often travel thousands of miles in wrong direction before arriving .
This is because web traffic and cables are owned by different companies .
As an email leaves one server and travels to the next, the GPS location of each server is 'tagged' into the email's code .

"Means you can lie down on top of your personal items while you snooze . By . Travelmail Reporter . It's the age-old problem of deciding where to store your valuables at the beach while enjoying a day-time snooze or a dip in the sea. However, an entrepreneur has invented a unique locker that can screw into the sand and hold personal items such as purses, mobile phones, small tablets and money. Marcal DaCunha's Beach Vault, which is expected to retail for £18, is closed by a special waterproof lid to stop any liquid seeping inside, and then covered by a towel and pillowcase. Scroll down for video . Handy gadget: Where to store your valuables on the beach is an age-old problem . Whenever a sun-seeker is lying on the towel to relax, the 12ins-deep and 6ins-wide container is completely concealed. Passing thieves would then have no opportunity to steal any of the valuables if a user fell asleep because they would be on top of the locker. Although the contraption could be picked up and stolen if it was left unattended, Marcal, 29, believes it is less likely to happen than by leaving belongings out in the open. The Beach Vault comes with a special towel that has a hole cut away for easy access, which is covered by an attached, inflatable pillow. Hidden treasure: Laying on the towel over the beach vault means you can rest-assured your valuables will be safe . Safety in the sand: The 12 inch deep and 6 inch wide container is completely concealed . DaCunha, a church pastor from New Jersey in the US, said: 'The whole thing started when my wife, Krystal, and I were travelling back from the beach. 'She said ""What if we had a container you could put underneath your towel that could hide all of your stuff?"" 'The idea was that if you were lying on the towel and you fell asleep you wouldn't have to worry about watching your stuff or trying to keep hold of it while closing your eyes. 'We spoke about it and spent a while making prototypes and coming up with ideas and we have now worked with engineers to come up with the Beach Vault. New design: Church pastor Marcal DaCunha, right, invented the Beach Vault, shown as an X-ray image, left . 'The Beach Vault screws into the sand and has a screw-top lid which has been built with a rubber O ring to make it waterproof. 'It is perfect for holding purses, wallets, phones, money, keys, and even has space for a book or an iPad Mini. 'The idea is you then place the towel over the top of it, which has a hole in it so you can access the container, but covered by a built-in pillow. 'This means that when you are lying down you are directly on top of your stuff and you don't have to worry about someone taking anything. Practical: Your valuables will be safe hidden under your towel in the Beach Vault . Safety first: Items such as mobile phones and tablets can be hidden away when you go for a quick doze . Secure: The Beach Vault is closed by a special waterproof lid to stop any liquid seeping inside . 'If you were to leave your stuff unattended the Beach Vault would remain completely out of sight. 'There is nothing to stop a thief from picking the whole thing up and leaving if they knew where it was, but this is the same risk as using a handbag.' Marcal is raising money on a crowdfunding website to go towards the manufacturing of the Beach Vault.","Waterproof locker, known as the Beach Vault, 12ins deep in the sand .

"By . Mark Duell . Feeling fed up because your wife always has the last word in an argument? Here’s something that might help you reverse the trend. Agreeing with everything their wives say only makes husbands miserable, according to scientists – so much so that their study had to be halted because the men involved became so unhappy. Yet it made their wives happier – although only slightly. Study: Agreeing with everything their wives say only makes husbands miserable, according to scientists - so much so that their study had to be halted because the men involved became so unhappy . For the study, published in the British Medical Journal, a group of husbands had to agree with every opinion and request expressed by their wives without complaint, even if they thought they were wrong. The researchers, from the University of . Auckland in New Zealand, found that the men’s quality of life dipped . from seven out of ten to three out of ten in only 12 days. In fact, the impact was so ‘severe’ the . study had to be abandoned. And despite the power they wielded, the . women’s happiness increased only slightly, from eight to 8.5. The study said: ‘It seems that being right is a cause of happiness, and agreeing with what one disagrees with is a cause of unhappiness. ‘The results of this trial show that the availability of unbridled power adversely affects the quality of life of those on the receiving end. ‘The study had to be stopped after 12 days as the result of a severe adverse outcome - this being that the male participant found the female participant became increasingly critical of everything he did.’ The researchers added: ‘Many people in the world live as couples, and we believe that it could be harmful for one partner to always have to agree with the other. ‘However, more research is needed to see whether our results hold if it is the male who is always right.’","Group of husbands had to agree with every opinion from their wives .

"By . Neil Sears . Under wraps: This is one of the E-fits drawn up by the investigators . The E-fits of a ‘new’ suspect for Madeleine McCann’s disappearance were drawn up five years ago – and suppressed. Images of a man seen carrying a child through Praia da Luz at 10pm on the night the then three-year-old vanished were unveiled on BBC1’s Crimewatch two weeks ago. They are based on evidence from Irish holidaymaker Martin Smith and his family. At the same time, the British police team behind a new investigation revealed they had discounted a 9.15pm sighting of a man with a child by Jane Tanner, a friend holidaying with parents Gerry and Kate McCann and their three children. It meant there was a new ‘timeline’ of Madeleine’s presumed abduction. Yet it emerged yesterday that the recently released E-fits were in fact contained in files produced five years ago by private investigators hired by the McCanns. Similarly, those private detectives had questioned the Tanner sighting and the timings associated with it. But the E-fits were kept private, and the questioning of the Tanner sighting and related timeline were kept quiet. One detective said he was ‘utterly stunned’ to see his five-year-old dossier suddenly presented as new on TV. The investigator told a Sunday newspaper: ‘I was absolutely stunned when I watched the programme... it most certainly wasn’t a new timeline and it certainly isn’t a new revelation. It is absolute nonsense to suggest either of those things... and those E-fits you saw on Crimewatch are ours.’ The McCanns are now fully behind the fresh police drive and release of the E-fits – but five years ago they were reluctant to issue them, possibly in part because witness Mr Smith’s account seemed inconsistent and unreliable. Months after the disappearance and after seeing Gerry McCann on TV, Mr Smith told police that he thought the man he saw carrying a girl around Madeleine’s age at the very time she went missing reminded him of Gerry McCann himself. Mr Smith has reportedly since withdrawn that claim – just as Portuguese police have officially told the McCanns they are no longer suspects for their daughter’s disappearance. The couple have also won libel damages for false suggestions that they were in any way involved. Numerous witnesses have also given statements making clear that Mr McCann was at his holiday complex at the moment the sighting occurred – which was at the very time when he and his wife started calling for help looking for Maddie. Madeleine McCann went missing in Praia da Luz in May 2007 . But shortly after Mr Smith told police Mr McCann may have been the man he had seen carrying a little girl, a friend of the McCanns said: ‘Look at the facts. This man sees an individual carrying a child on the night Maddie vanished. ‘He waits 13 days to report this to the police, going back to Ireland  in the meantime. At this stage he admits he has no idea who the man is. Almost four months go by before, after seeing him on TV, he feels that it could be Gerry. ‘The truth is that this is part of  the victimisation of Gerry and Kate which has gone on from the very beginning by the Portuguese.’ Portuguese police have officially told Kate and Gerry McCann they are no longer suspects for the disappearance . In 2008, the McCanns used money from their charity fund to hire investigators from a firm called Oakley International, led by  former MI5 surveillance officer Henri Exton, to look into the mystery – and they focused on the Smith sighting. They produced a dossier and called for the E-fits to be published. They also suggested Madeleine could have died after wandering off. The McCanns, who became embroiled in an unconnected financial dispute with Oakley International at around the time they received the dossier, responded by warning the detectives of legal action if they publicised their report. A source close to the fund said the report would have been ‘completely distracting’ if it had become public. Porn star Mark Sloan played Matthew Oldfield - one of the McCanns' doctor friends - in the Crimewatch appeal . A porn star was employed by the BBC to appear in the reconstruction of Madeleine McCann’s disappearance, it has emerged. Mark Sloan, 45, played Matthew Oldfield - one of the McCanns’ doctor friends - in the Crimewatch appeal, watched by a show record of 6.7million. Sloan, who says he has made previous appearances on the show, has starred in a host of crudely-titled porn films. But a spokesman for Mothers Against Murder And Aggression criticised the BBC for hiring someone who has ‘openly worked in the sex industry for something so sensitive’. Labour MP John Mann added: ‘This is not the standard we expect from the BBC.’","Images of man seen carrying child through Praia da Luz on the night of Madeleine's disappearance were unveiled on Crimewatch two weeks ago .

"By . James  Nye . Since he rode his board to fame six months ago, Kama the surfing pig has discovered the benefits of living life as a professional beach-bum. He spends his days on the sands of Oahu surrounded by adoring bikini-clad girls, all desperate to nuzzle up to and hug Hawaii's legendary piglet, despite the fact he now has his own little miss piggy. Indeed, with his celebrity, sponsorship has flooded in from brands such as Local Motion, Safeway and even GoPro, who have created a unique harness for Kama to wear while he rides the half-pipes and checks the breaks. Scroll down for video . Fans: Kama the surfing pig is a major attraction on the beaches on Oahu, Hawaii, and admirers are never far . He's so good that Costco gives him free surfboards and his devoted owner, Kai Holt, has promised never to cook him in an imu, a Hawaiian underground oven. In February, his human, Kai, told Hawaii News Now that he knows Kama enjoys the surf. 'He really gets off on it. It seems like he has a good time out there,' said Holt. 'You know surfing is Hawaii's gift to the world. It's like true happiness, you know, that's what this guy does. Everywhere he goes he just makes people smile and laugh. He just brings joy to the world.' Kama's surfing career started at the turn of the year when he stumbled into the Holt family's cabana at Bellows Beach. GoPro: Kama's exploits aboard his surfboard are expertly recorded using a GoPro camera - the preserve of the best and most committed athletes . Free: Kama shows no fear as he surfs with Braiden off the coast of Oahu . Break on through: Kama's fame now is such that he has his own celebrity Instagram account which covers his surfing escapades . Hot stuff: Kama and his fans relax on a boat off the coast of Hawaii - which is no bother for Kama - who firmly has his sea legs . Hey you: Kama is never more happier than on the beach, covered in sand, surrounded by his adoring fans . They brought the little piggy home and realized his natural ability in the water when he fell into the family swimming pool in their backyard. 'I had no idea pigs could swim,' Holt said. It wasn't long before Holt and his son Braiden took Kama to Sandy Beach and the four-legged pig was jumping onto Holt's standup paddle board. 'It's funny when there's a big wave and a bump coming and he launches into the air,' Braiden said. 'I think he's gonna drown, but he just pops right up out of the foam.' Friends: With his fame and exciting exploits, Kama (left) has no problems attracting the ladies who love to spend time with him . Holt and Kama's bond is tight, they go everywhere together and sometimes even sleep in the same bed. 'As long as he lives, he's not gonna see a dinner plate, that's for sure,' Holt said. 'He wont see the inside of an imu.' Kama gets his boards from Costco and his surfing clothes from Local Motion. He even has his own Instagram account, kamathesurfingpig, where he keeps his more than 940 followers up-to-date on his adventures, especially with the ladies.","Kama the Hawaiian pig has been surfing since the beginning of the year .

"By . Fiona Macrae . Being lonely in later life could be worse for your health than obesity, according to research. Feeling cut off from others can push blood pressure up into the danger zone for heart attacks and strokes, weaken the immune system and raise the risk of depression, a conference was told. The US researchers urged those in middle-age to think about how they are going to stay socially active in old age – and warned against retiring to the sun. Being lonely could be twice as likely to kill you as being fat. Research shows that despite the concern about obesity, feeling isolated and unloved is more likely to send someone to an early grave . John Cacioppo, a professor of psychology who has spent 20 years studying the impact of loneliness, tracked the health of more than 2,000 men and women aged 50-plus for six years. The loneliest men and women were almost twice as likely to die during that period than those who felt the most wanted and needed. Another study found loneliness to be twice as deadly as obesity. Feeling cut off from others can push blood pressure up into the danger zone for heart attacks and strokes, weaken the immune system and raise the odds of depression, the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s annual conference heard. It can also disrupt sleep, leaving people feeling lethargic the next day and more likely to rely on sleeping tablets. Professor Cacioppo, of the University of Chicago, has shown that we don’t sleep less when we are lonely – we just wake up more. It is thought that if we feel isolated were are extra-alert to threats and so wake up at the slightest noise. The US researchers urged those in middle-age to think about how they are going to stay socially active in old age - and warned against retiring to the sun . The warnings come as Britain faces the twin challenge of an ageing population and an increasingly fragmented society, in which many people communicate over the internet rather than face-to-face. Professor Cacioppo said: ‘We are experiencing a silver tsunami demographically.  The baby boomers are reaching retirement age. People have to think about how to protect themselves.’ He suggests the retired stay in touch with former colleagues and stay near their family – and advises against a new start in the sun. The professor said: ‘We have mythic notions of retirement.  We think that retirement means leaving friends and family and buying a place where it is warm and living happily ever after. But that’s probably not the best idea. ‘We find people who continue to interact with coworkers after retirement and have friends close by are less lonely. Take time to enjoy yourself and share good times with family and friends. Non-lonely people enjoy themselves with other people.’ The conference also heard that it is not physical isolation in itself but the sense of isolation that is damaging. In other words, it is possible to feel lonely despite being married or surrounded by people.","US researchers urge people to stay socially active in their old age .

"By . Richard Shears . The coy residents of a small Japanese town have been so shocked by a replica of Michelangelo’s Renaissance sculpture of a naked David that they have called for it to be fitted out in underpants. The 16ft replica of the classic sculpture has been put up in a park in Okuizumo where, standing on a plinth, it towers over everyone visiting the area to use the nearby running track, baseball stadium and tennis courts. It is also close to a children’s play area, which is of added concern to residents who have objected to the statue’s nudity. The 16ft replica of the masterpiece in Okuizumo town government has caused a stir among residents who say its 'nakedness' is scaring children and it should wear underpants . ‘It’s frightening the children and worrying the adults with its nakedness’ said a town official. ‘Several people have asked us to cover it up with underpants.’ The statue, along with a replica of Greek treasure the ‘topless’ Venus de Milo, was presented to the town by a businessman who comes from the area. Both statues were erected in a prominent position in the park and while many residents have appreciated the gift, some have admitted they are worried about the blatant nakedness on display. ‘Some people have told the town’s legislators that toddlers are afraid of the statues because they are so big and they appeared unexpectedly over the summer,’ said Mr Yoji Morinaga, a town official. ‘They are statues of unclothed humans, and such pieces of art work are very rare in our area. ‘Some people apparently said the statues might not be good for their children. 'It’s the first time we have had anything like this in our town. Perhaps people were perplexed.’ Town official Yoki Morinaga says art featuring 'unclothed humans' such as Michelangelo's David, left, and ancient statue Venus de Milo, right, is rare in Japan . And while many locals who live in the mountainside town of fewer than 15,000 residents have welcomed the new cultural additions, some have asked for David to be fitted out with underwear ‘to preserve modesty’, said the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper. Local officials said they hoped that . residents would in time come to appreciate the value of the sculptures, . which could be useful in school art classes and even be a sightseeing . attraction.

The . 41-year-old photographer’s subjects have included Lady Gaga and . Beyonce, but authorities have decided that – despite what the Western . world might think -  male nudity is a far cry from pop stars and if he . is convicted of obscenity he could be jailed for up to two years. Under . local laws, genitals must be obscured in books, magazines and the . internet, a process usually carried out through pixellation.","Residents have complained about the statue because it is near a park .

Despite life for women improving since the end of Taliban rule, domestic abuse is still rife and forced marriages are the norm. Women are not encouraged to go to school and suicide rates for women are among the highest in the world. Afghanistan brought in the Elimination of Violence Against Women law in August 2009. The law criminalised child marriage, selling and buying women to settle disputes, assault and other acts of violence and abuse against women. But according to the UN, prosecutions of such cases have increased by only two per cent. In 2010, an Afghan teenager called Aisha featured on the front cover of Time.

"By . Adam Shergold . There was a time at the World Cup when managers had to get by with just 11 men. They would name their starting selection and the game would unfold, for better or worse, largely beyond their control. But the impact substitute carries an ever increasing importance, as shown by the record 29 goals scored so far in Brazil by those who have been summoned from the bench. This tally is already six goals more than the second highest total, set in 2006, and we still have the business end of the tournament to get through.

"By . Rachel Reilly . Many sleep experts blame using mobiles and tablets into the early hours for a bad night's sleep, but gadgets may not disrupt sleep at all – so long as you dim the lights and keep it at a safe distance from your face. Recent research has shown that LED screen disrupts sleep because it stops the body producing the hormone melanin, which responds to light and govern whether we feel sleepy or not. But the new study has found that simply lowering the brightness of a screen and holding the gadget about 12 inches away from the face can stop the light from interfering with a good night’s sleep. Smartphones and other gadgets used before bed can cause restless nights because the light causes melatonin suppression - a chemical which controls the body clock . ‘In the old days, people would go to bed and read a book. But much more commonly people go to bed and they have their tablet on which they read a book or they read a newspaper or they're looking at material. 'The problem is it's a lit device, and how problematic is the light source from the mobile device?’ co-author Dr. Lois Krahn, a psychiatrist at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale in Arizona, told Medical Daily. Last month Harvard academic and sleep expert Professor Charles Czeisler called for more research into the effects of artificial light after he published an article in journal Nature. He said that modern humans are exposed to four times more light than 60 years ago and it was disrupting our sleep patterns. He explained that the decline in the number of hours slept per night is affecting public health, including a greater risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, depression and stroke in adults and concentration problems in children. Previous studies found that using a phone late at night prevents production of the sleep hormone melanin. Now experts say holding the phone close to your face could be the problem . The new study investigated how levels of light emitted from mobile devices at different distances from a user's face compared to the threshold of light that suppresses the secretion of melatonin, 30 lux. In a dark room, they used a sensitive light meter to measure the light coming from two Apple tablets and a smartphone: an iPad 1, an iPad 3 with retinal display, and an iPhone 4. The emitted light was measured at 0 inches and 14 inches from a user's face. Results . showed that when the brightness was lowered to the minimal setting, the . LED lights of all three devices were well below the 30 lux . melatonin-suppressing threshold. ‘We found that only at the highest setting was the light over a conservative threshold that might affect melatonin levels,' said Dr. Krahn. 'If it's at the mid setting or at a low setting it's bright enough to use.’ Experts said some gadgets only need  the backlight dimmed while other devices such as the iPad 3 require a two-pronged approach to reduce light levels becoming too high . At the lowest brightness setting, held . right up against a user's face, the iPhone 4's backlight measured only 2 . lux, the iPad 1 measured 11 lux, and the iPad 3 measured 2 lux. Held 14 inches away from a user's face, all the devices measured between 0 and 3 lux at the lowest brightness setting. At the brightest setting measured from the same distance from a user's face, the iPhone 4 measured 275 lux, the iPad 1 measured 124 lux, and the iPad 3 measured 248 lux — all far above the melatonin-disrupting limit. When held 14 inches away at the brightest setting, the iPhone 4 measured 8 lux and the iPad 1 measured 21 lux. The iPad 3, however, measured 32 lux — just above the threshold. The results suggest that if you must use your smartphone or tablet before bed, you should either keep the screen brightness at the lowest setting or hold it at least a foot from your face in order to avoid disrupting sleep. If you have a mobile device with a particularly strong backlight, like the iPad 3, you should do both.","Previous studies have shown that LED lights in phones disturb production of sleep hormone melanin .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Court: Leon Lawrence (pictured here arriving at Southwark Crown Court) was convicted of attempting to convert criminal property, after the theft of the Banksy artwork from a hotel in central London . A convicted art thief who tried to sell a stolen Banksy on eBay for £17,000 walked free from court again today. Leon Lawrence, 32, put the artwork - called Sperm Alarm - by the world famous graffiti artist up for auction after it was ripped from a hotel wall last year. He was traced after staff at the four-star Hesperia Hotel in Victoria, central London, noticed the piece was missing and spotted it for sale online. Southwark Crown Court heard Lawrence . admitted stealing a sculpture from a gallery in Brick Lane, east London, . and was given a community order in July last year. Lawrence had used his account LeonLeon to try and sell the Banksy between February 9 and April 4, 2011. The artwork attributed to the . guerrilla graffiti artist, which shows 15 sperm swarming round a red . sprinkler alarm, has never been recovered. Edward Franklin, prosecuting, said staff at the hotel had noticed the artwork as soon as it had been produced. ‘Staff realised it was there, and they also realised when someone had come along and taken their panel,' he said. ‘That piece of panel, with Banksy’s . design on it, dubbed the ‘Sperm Alarm’ was later put for sale on eBay . and they contacted the police. ‘The seller on eBay was registered . at LeonLeon and by working out who that person was, Mr Lawrence entered . into their investigation. ‘He was trying to sell this stolen art.’ Police found images of the work on Lawrence’s his laptop. ‘One picture shows the panel, and the space where the panel was, having been removed,’ Mr Franklin said. ‘Another image from Mr Lawrence’s computer shows the panel itself having been removed. ‘Another [image] shows the Sperm Alarm in the process of being framed. Lawrence claimed a friend named ‘Arek’ had given him the artwork and he had no reason to be suspicious. He was convicted unanimously by a . jury of attempting to convert criminal property, but cleared of a single . count of handling stolen goods. The judge, Mr Recorder Peter Lodder . QC handed Lawrence a suspended sentence and said: ‘You were convicted by . the jury of attempting to convert or transfer criminal property. ‘That criminal property was a section of wall which bore a Banksy work of graffiti art which you attempted to sell for £17,000. ‘I bear in mind that value, I also . bear in mind that the section of wall was stolen on February 11, 2011, . and found on your computer was a photo showing you had possession of . that artwork by just before 2pm the next day. ‘Your recent criminal activity seems to be focused on pieces of art.’ Stolen: Mr Lawrence attempted to sell the artwork for £17,000 on eBay (pictured) But the judge said letters written by his family had swayed him away from jailing Lawrence, who first began offending in 1996. ‘You are lucky to have such devoted support despite your criminal offending. ‘So I’m prepared to give you a final chance by suspending that sentence. Do not fail.’ He was sentenced to nine months in jail, suspended, for 12 months, and ordered to carry out 240 hours unpaid work. He was also made the subject of a 12 month supervision order. Lawrence of Covent Garden, central London, was found guilty of attempting to convert criminal property, but cleared of handling stolen goods.","Staff at central London hotel alerted police after noticing artwork was missing .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Known for their chilled-out demeanor and slow pace of life, it will come as no surprise to most people to learn that surfers have poor timekeeping. What is more surprising though is how one sportsman made up for his lack of punctuality - by jumping 30 feet off a cliff and into a raging sea after he was late for a compeition. This unnamed surfer was spotted by photographer and graphic designer Allen Hughes as he was capturing images of a surfing competition off of Lighthouse Point, in Santa Cruz, California. This is the moment a surfer who was late for a competition off of Lighthouse Point, Santa Cruz, jumped 30 feet off a cliff just in time to catch his heat . Hughes, 65, said: 'Everyone else was watching the surfers out at sea, but then I noticed this guy running along Lighthouse Point. I watched for quite a while and before each heat the surfers would climb down to the end of Lighthouse Point and make a smaller 10 foot jump. 'I noticed this guy run down to the end, he was late for his heat. I could tell he was anxious so I focused my camera on him and before anyone knew it, he ran and jumped off the cliff. 'He timed it perfectly and landed just behind the white water and paddled out. I never did find out who he was. The cliff itself must be 30 foot high and the waves were maybe higher.' The unnamed athlete ran along the rocky cliff clutching his board before making the impressive leap, watched by photographer Allen Hughes . He added: 'In my youth I jumped from this rock all the time, but never when the sea was like this.' Lighthouse Point is located at the northern point of Monterey Bay just south of Santa Cruz as is a world renowned surfing spot. The waters are known as Steamer Lane and it was here that Jack O'Neill developed the modern-day wetsuit and the 'leash' which attaches a surfer's board to their leg so it doesn't get lost if they fall off. The waters off of Lighthouse Point are known as Steamer Lane and are where Jack O'Neill developed the modern wetsuit and where he lost his eye . The bearded businessman also lost his eye while surfing the waters, which lead to him wearing his famous eye patch. It is the home of O'Neill Wetsuits and every year for the last three decades it hosts the O'Neill Coldwater Classic competition in November. The lighthouse itself is home to the Santa Cruz surfing museum which features a collection of rare and vintage surf boards. Surfing has been present in Santa Cruz for over 100 years and was introduced by Hawaiians who used wooden planks to ride waves, a far cry from today's carbon fiber boards.","The unnamed man was spotted by an amateur photographer running along the cliff .

"By . Nick Harris for The Mail on Sunday . CLICK HERE to read the original story as we revealed the scandal of match-fixing . More than 300 games in the last year around the world are believed to have involved match-fixing, including a ‘double-digit’ number in England over the past two seasons, according to a variety of integrity sources. The revelation comes a week after this newspaper revealed that the FA have a secret ‘watch list’ of footballers suspected of being involved in fixing or with fixing gangs. SportRadar, a Swiss-based firm with a hub in Richmond, Surrey, is known to work in co-operation with various football associations and police forces to combat fixing. The firm would not comment on specific information it has provided to police or associations but in quantifying the scale of the fixing problem in general, a spokesman told the Mail on Sunday: ‘Our fraud detection system has classified more than 1,500 football matches as suspicious since 2005. We have also detected a lot of other manipulated matches in various other sports.' In court: Wilson Maj Perumal watches on as he is tried for match fixing in Finland in 2011 . Fixing is firmly back on football’s agenda after the former chief executive of the European Professional Football Leagues, Emanuel Medeiros, said last week that he knew of at least one club in Europe being run by criminal gangs for fixing purposes. ‘I have evidence but I cannot say which club or which country,’ said Medeiros, speaking at the Soccerex conference in Manchester. At the same conference, the president of Sporting Lisbon, Bruno de Carvalho, voiced his fears that the rise of third-party ownership (TPO) of players across Europe has also raised the risk of fixing. Carvalho said TPO was ‘a monster that is living in almost all the clubs’ and that he believed there were links between some TPO funds and gambling. ‘Many times there are similar owners from the funds and gambling companies, so match-fixing is the worst fear now for football,’ he said. Another example of the shocking extent to which fixing now abounds within football was provided by the head of the Hong Kong FA, Mark Sutcliffe. Watched: Krishna Ganeshan (left) and Chann Sankaran (right), pictured whilst under surveillance . He described how the HK FA staged an Under 16s friendly tournament last year, and received an intelligence warning from SportRadar that one match would be fixed by a specific score. He tried and failed to get the Hong Kong police to take an interest. The match ended in exactly the way the high-scoring ‘fix’ was predicted. SportRadar’s security team monitor not just betting patterns from bookmakers globally but also pivotal incidents in games and movements of players and associates. In the past six months alone their investigations have led to 60 arrests and 19 charges of match-fixing or similar crimes in countries including Australia and Hong Kong. SportRadar declined to comment on what if any involvement they have in providing specific intelligence to any UK authorities. The firm’s director of integrity, Darren Small, said: ‘Match-fixing is not purely a “sport issue”. Treating this as a sport issue does not reflect the reality of today's match-fixing industry. ‘Fixing is organised and executed by the most aggressive and sophisticated organised crime syndicates and structures from all corners of the world. As far as they are concerned, match-fixing requires low investment, carries weak sanctions, has no co-ordinated transnational response and generates serious profit. And these profits are not spent on cars and mansions. They are reinvested in all the other forms of crime that the world works so hard to combat: weapons and people trafficking, prostitution, drug smuggling and so on. ‘None of the stakeholders involved can do this alone and we remain committed to working hand in hand with any and all organisations that are serious about the threat and serious about taking it on.’ Scandal: Southern Star soccer players Reiss Noel (centre) and Joe Woolley (right) leave court in Melbourne . Krishna Sanjey Ganeshan . British citizen of Sri Lankan heritage who was jailed in June for five years for a conspiracy to fix matches played in England in November 2013.

The fight took place at North Ipswich Reserve - west of Brisbane in Queensland - about 5pm on Sunday. Queensland Police Service officers were trying to arrest a man at a football match and they allege 'a large number of other people' tried to intervene. Scroll down for video . A police officer was injured during a 100-person brawl in Ipswich - west of Brisbane in Queensland . While the man was being placed into a police vehicle, it is also alleged a senior constable was punched in the head, causing him to fall face-first onto a concrete gutter. Other police units were called to the scene to break up the fight and 12 people were arrested. Ipswich Police District Inspector Keith McDonald told Daily Mail Australia they had arrested the first man because he was acting 'inappropriately' after the game. 'He was arrested and subsequently things have gone down hill from there,' he said. 'Members of his family and the crowd have then become involved and the crowd swelled.' Spectators were the only people involved in the brawl. It started off with just a few members of the crowd and then escalated . The incident started after people were trying to help a man who was being arrested by police . The incident occurred at North Ipswich Reserve after a rugby league grand final . Insp McDonald later told reporters the man had been making obscene gestures at a group of people leaving the venue and despite being asked by police to stop, he continued with the behaviour. It was then that police arrested him for failing to obey police directions. 'The rest of the family and other members of the crowd have become involved in a continual movement of harassment towards police officers,' he said. Insp McDonald said alcohol played a role in the incident and condemned those who were involved. 'Police aren't going to be punching bags or assaulted by members of the community,' he said. He added that the senior constable who was hospitalised was 'extremely lucky' he did not suffer more severe injuries. The senior constable was taken to St Andrews Private Hospital with facial injuries to the forehead, nose, right cheek and jaw but has since been released.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . People who use Facebook and Twitter are less likely than others to share their opinions on hot-button issues, even when they are offline. That's according to a survey that challenges the view of social media as a vehicle for debate. The study suggests that sites like Facebook and Twitter might actually encourage self-censorship. Online loudmouths may be annoying, but a new survey suggests they are in the minority. In a report released Tuesday, the Pew Research Center found that most people who regularly use social media sites were actually less likely to share their opinions, even offline (stock image shown) The study was carried out by Pew Research Centre in Washington DC in conjunction with Rutgers University in New Jersey. Facebook is on a quest to 'weed out' links to ‘click-baiting’ stories that are designed to make people click on them. The social network says that by monitoring how long people spend reading news articles, as well as how they interact with them, it can prioritise the best content that pops up in people's News Feeds. In a blog post, research scientist Khalid El-Arini, and Joyce Tang, a product specialist at Facebook, said the firm has made improvements ‘to help people find the posts and links from publishers that are most interesting and relevant, and to continue to weed out stories that people frequently tell us are spammy and that they don’t want to see. Facebook said a survey revealed that 80 per cent of its users prefer headlines what make the content of an article crystal clear, so they can work out if a link is worth clicking on. Researchers said they detected what they call the 'spiral of silence' phenomenon: Unless people know their audience agrees, they are likely to shy away from discussing anything controversial. In other words, most people are more comfortable with ice-bucket challenges than political banter. 'People do not tend to be using social media for this type of important political discussion,' said Keith Hampton, a communications professor at Rutgers University who helped conduct the study. 'And if anything, it may actually be removing conversation from the public sphere.' The survey was conducted shortly after Edward Snowden acknowledged leaking classified intelligence that exposed widespread government surveillance of Americans' phone and email records. Hampton said the Snowden case provided researchers with a concrete example of a major national issue that divided Americans and dominated news coverage. Of the 1,801 adults surveyed, 86 per cent said they would be willing to discuss their views about government surveillance if it came up at various in-person scenarios, such as at a public meeting, at work or at a restaurant with friends. But just 42 per cent of Facebook or Twitter users said they would be willing to post online about it. In addition, the typical Facebook user - defined as someone who logs onto the site a few times per day - was actually half as likely to discuss the Snowden case at a public meeting as a non-Facebook user. Meanwhile, someone who goes on Twitter a few times per day was one-quarter as likely to share opinions in the workplace compared with those who never use Twitter. Only when a person felt that their Facebook network agreed with their opinion were they twice as likely to join a site discussion on the issue, the survey found. Researchers in Washington DC and New Jersey say Facebook (stock image shown) and Twitter are stifling people's opinions. In the study they found typical users were afraid to voice their opinions offline. They call this the 'spiral of silence' phenomenon where people shy away from discussing controversial topics . Another finding was that social media didn't make it easier for people to share opinions they wouldn't otherwise share. Of the 14 per cent of Americans unwilling to discuss the Snowden case with others in person, fewer than one-half of 1 per cent were willing to discuss it on social media. Lee Rainie, director of the Pew Research Center Internet Project, said one explanation is it's possible that social media actually makes people sensitive to different opinions. 'Because they use social media, they may know more about the depth of disagreement over the issue in their wide circle of contacts,' he said. 'This might make them hesitant to speak up either online or offline for fear of starting an argument, offending or even losing a friend.' Hampton added that there is a concern that a person's fear of offending someone on social media stifles debate. 'A society where people aren't able to share their opinions openly and gain from understanding alternative perspectives is a polarised society,' he said.","Researchers at the Pew Research Centre in Washington DC and New Jersey say Facebook and Twitter are stifling people's opinions .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . Scientists have been left shocked by the surprising appearance of hundreds of methane vents off the US East Coast. More than 500 vents have been found where methane is seeping into the ocean. And there is concern that these increased amounts of gas could be caused by global warming. A large number of methane vents have been found off the US East Coast. The findings suggest such leakage is far more widespread in the Atlantic than thought. Here methane is seen streaming from the seafloor at a depth of about 1,400 feet (425 metres) offshore from Virginia . The study published in Nature Geosciences was carried out by researchers from Mississippi State University, the US Geological Survey (USGS) and other institutions. A cold seep or cold vent is an area of the ocean floor where hydrogen sulphide, methane and other hydrocarbon-rich fluid seepage occurs. Despite the term, the temperature of a seepage is not lower than surrounding sea water - in many cases the temperature is slightly higher. Cold seeps develop over fissures on the seafloor caused by tectonic activity. Oil and methane seep out of those fissures and emerge over an area several hundred metres wide. Entire ecosystems can develop around the unique make-up of a cold seep. The research suggests that natural methane leakage from the seafloor is far more widespread in the US Atlantic than previously thought. In total more than 570 seafloor cold seeps were observed between Cape Hatteras, North Carolina and Georges Bank, Massachusetts. Cold seeps are areas where gases and fluids leak into the surrounding water from sediments on the seafloor. The seeps were found on the outer continental shelf and the continental slope of the eastern US. Previously, only three seep areas had been identified in this area - making the findings a dramatic increase on what was known before. ‘Widespread seepage had not been expected on the Atlantic margin,’ said Adam Skarke, the study’s lead author and a professor at Mississippi State University. ‘It is not near a plate tectonic boundary like the US Pacific coast, nor associated with a petroleum basin like the northern Gulf of Mexico.’ In total more than 570 seafloor cold seeps were seen between Cape Hatteras, North Carolina and Georges Bank, Massachusetts (shown in this map). The study, published in Nature Geosciences, was carried out by researchers from Mississippi State University, the US Geological Survey (USGS) and other institutions . The seeps were found on the outer continental shelf and the continental slope of the eastern US (illustration shown). Previously, only three seep areas had been identified in this area - making the findings a dramatic increase on what was known before . The location of the seeps and knowledge of the underlying geology suggests the leaking methane is being produced by microbial processes in shallow sediments. At depths of more than 2,000 feet (600 metres) in some places, the seeps are too deep to release methane directly into the atmosphere. However, there is the danger that if the methane stays in the water, it could oxidise into carbon dioxide. This can increase the acidity of ocean waters and reduce oxygen levels, which can be harmful to marine life. While not directly pointing a finger at climate change, the researchers indicate that global warming could be the cause of the problem. ‘Warming of ocean temperatures on seasonal, decadal or much longer time scales can cause gas hydrate to release its methane, which may then be emitted at seep sites,’ said Dr Carolyn Ruppel, study co-author and chief of the USGS Gas Hydrates Project. ‘Such continental slope seeps have previously been recognised in the Arctic, but not at mid-latitudes. So this is a first.’ In this image push cores are used to collect samples of the sediment found near a seep site, allowing investigation into the biological, chemical and physical make up of the bottom during the Deeptwater Canyons 2013 Expedition, from which some of the findings were made .","A large number of methane vents have been found off the US East Coast .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . Most people have, at some point in their life, experienced the panic induced when they forget where their car is parked. But Apple have planned a solution in the form of an app that reveals where your car is hiding. And what’s more, the app doesn’t need an internet connection - so you’ll be able to find your car even if it’s lost in an underground car park. California-based Apple is planning an app for iOS devices to locate parked cars. It will track when a user exits a car and then direct them back later on. In this image from the patent application, it shows how it can track when a user has exited a car and save its location . The move was revealed in a series of patent applications from the Cupertino-based company by Apple Insider. Google Now uses speed sensors in your phone to work out when you're leaving a vehicle. When it detects a change in motion, the app drops what is known as a 'parking card' onto a map. If the card gets it wrong the first time, the service will also offer alternative places that you can check. The drawback is you may also see the card if you get out of a bus or another person’s car. Published by the US Patent and Trademark Office, the filings show that the service - which would likely be integrated with Apple Maps - can accurately locate a car. And using device to car connectivity, an internet connection would not be needed. It’s believed the service will not be too dissimilar to that offered by Google Now. The app will be able to tell when the user is driving in a car, and can then work out when they have stopped and exited the vehicle. This lets it know that the user has parked, and it provides a ‘pin’ on a map so the car can easily be located accurately. The pin can also be manually removed or moved as needed. When the user then needs to return to their car, they load up the app and directions are shown for them on their iOS device. When the user is ready to return to the car the app will show the user which way to walk and give directions, as outlined in this image from the patent application . The app will also work without a network connection, instead using Bluetooth for car to device connectivity. This means that even if a car is parked underground (stock image shown) it could be found . However, where it differs from Google’s service is that Apple would enable such location services without the need for a network connection or GPS. This could be done by connecting to the car via Bluetooth, allowing the app to direct the user towards it. In the absence of internet, Apple Insider reports that the app will use a few tricks to locate the car. For example, it can combine sporadic GPS data with information from an iPhone’s accelerometer to deduce how far the user is from the car. There's no news yet on when the service will be rolled out, but it is just one of several innovations that Apple is planning as part of its 'Car Play' initiative. It is planning to integrate other services like Siri into cars to make iOS and vehicles more connected than ever. Google already has its own version of the service integrated in Google Now, but it's believed Apple is now planning to roll out its own service for iOS devices (stock image shown)","California-based company is planning an app to locate parked cars .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard for MailOnline . Humans have used up the natural resources the world can supply in a year in less than eight months, campaigners have warned. The world has now reached 'Earth Overshoot Day', the point in the year when humans have exhausted supplies. This includes natural resources such as land, trees and fish, and means today we have outstripped the planet's annual capacity to absorb waste products such as carbon dioxide. Scroll down for video . Humans have used up the natural resources the world can supply in a year in less than eight months, campaigners have warned. For the rest of the year, the world is in ecological debt . For the rest of the year, the world is in ecological debt, with food stocks and forests being depleted, land degraded and carbon dioxide building up in the atmosphere. The problem is worsening, with the planet sliding into 'ecological debt' earlier and earlier. This means the day on which the world has used up all the natural resources available for the year has shifted from early October in 2000 to August 19 in 2014. In 1961, humans used only around three-quarters of the capacity Earth has for generating food, timber, fish and absorbing greenhouse gases, with most countries having more resources than they consumed. The world has now reached 'Earth Overshoot Day', the point in the year when humans have exhausted supplies. This includes natural resources such as land, trees and fish, and means today we have outstripped the planet's annual capacity to absorb waste products such as carbon dioxide . But now 86 per cent of the world's population lives in countries where the demands made on nature - the nation's 'ecological footprint' - outstrip what that country's resources can cope with. The Global Footprint Network, which calculates Earth overshoot day, said it would currently take 1.5 Earths to produce the renewable natural resources needed to support human requirements. Also known as Ecological Debt Day, this year, Earth Overshoot Day is on the 19th of August. In fewer than eight months, people use more natural resources than the planet is able to produce in a 12 month period. For the remainder of 2014, we will be living on resources borrowed from future generations, scientists claim. It is calculated by dividing the world's biocapacity – the amount of natural resources generated by the planet that year – by   humanity's natural consumption of Earth's resources for 12 months. It is then multiplied by 365, the number of days in a year. The concept for Earth Overshoot Day was created by Andrew Simms, climate economist at Global Witness, a London-based think tank. The network warned that governments that ignore resource limits in decision-making are putting long-term economic security at risk. Mathis Wackernagel, president of the Global Footprint Network, said: 'Global overshoot is becoming a defining challenge of the 21st century. It is both an ecological and economic problem. 'Countries with resource deficits and low incomes are exceptionally vulnerable. 'Even high-income countries that have had a financial advantage to shield themselves from the most direct impacts of resource dependence need to realise that a long-term solution requires addressing such dependencies before they turn into a significant economic stress.' Andrew Simms, climate economist at Global Witness, who came up with the concept of Earth overshoot day at UK think tank the New Economics Foundation, said last year that the government  seems intent on pushing people to break our environmental budget. 'The maths is simple - the UK consumes and produces waste at a rate three and a half times greater than we can sustain, and today humanity has already exhausted what the planet's ecosystems can provide in a year,' he said. 'We're in the red and gambling with ecological bankruptcy, as the fracking debate shows. If it chose to, the Government can always print more money, but it can't print more planet. Ecological overshoot should lead the political agenda.' Earth Overshoot Day is calculated by dividing the world's biocapacity – the amount of natural resources generated by the planet that year – by humanity's natural consumption of Earth's resources for 12 months.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard for MailOnline . A British inventor is hoping to turn the world of the humble umbrella on its head after designing one that folds inwards to stop water dripping onto the floor. Rather than creating pools of rainwater when it is put away, like normal umbrellas, the Kazbrella folds the opposite way, collecting drips inside it. It also solves the problem of poking passers-by in the head with an umbrella's spokes because it opens from the top rather than the bottom. Scroll down for video . A British inventor is hoping to turn the world of the umbrella upside down after designing one that folds inwards (pictured) to stop water dripping onto the floor . According to its inventor, Jenan Kazim, it means users can stay dry for longer by putting their umbrellas down once inside, avoiding damage by strong gusts of wind. Mr Kazim, an aeronautical engineer, came up with the idea after his mother-in-law complained her regular umbrella had dripped all over the floor of her house. He has been accused of trying to reinvent the wheel - but he claims his invention could be the future for the much-needed umbrella. The device is now in the final design process before being put into production in a few months' time and is expected to cost around £45 ($75). It also solves the problem of poking passers-by in the head (pictured) with an umbrella's spokes because it opens from the top rather than the bottom. According to inventor, Jenan Kazim, users can stay dry for longer . Rather than creating pools of rainwater when it is put away like normal umbrellas, this device folds the opposite way, collecting drips inside it (pictured) The Kazbrella turns inside out leaving the dry side of the canopy on the outside. To close the umbrella, users pull it up, instead of pulling it down, as is the case with a normal brolly. This captures the dripping water within so it doesn't make the surroundings wet. The website claims it does this by using 'patented' folds that change the way the umbrella opens and closes . It will cost around £45 ($75) when it is launched later this year. Mr Kazim, 61, from St Albans, Hertfordshire, said: 'A number of years ago my mother-in-law was walking into her house from the rain with her umbrella. 'She put it down as she came into the house and stood it up on its end like normal but it dripped water all over her floor.' The Kazbrella turns inside out leaving the dry side of the canopy on the outside. To close the umbrella you pull it up, instead of pulling it down as is the case with a normal brolly. 'I'm an engineer by trade and it got me thinking about what I could do to remedy the problem,' said Mr Kazim. 'The initial idea to turn the conventional design upside down so that it closes in on itself came pretty quickly, but it took me some time to work out how I was going to do it. By putting their umbrellas down once they are inside a car, users can avoid damage by strong gusts of wind . The Kazbrella (pictured) is expected to cost £45 ($75) when it is launched later this year . 'Kazbrella won't drip on your floor once you come in out of the rain and, unlike normal brollies, you don't have to lift it way above people's heads to put it up. 'It won't poke people in the face, you can put it down once you're sat inside a car to make sure you stay dry for longer, and it can't be blown inside out by the wind because it's already inside out. 'Umbrellas have been around for 3,000 years and some people have said I'm trying to reinvent the wheel but what I'm actually doing is evolving a design which is great but has flaws. 'The Kazbrella has the same iconic look as a normal umbrella but it resolves some of the problems that have beset umbrellas for millennia.' The 'Kazbrella won't drip on your floor once the user comes in out of the rain, and unlike normal brollies you don't have to lift it way above people's heads to put it up,' said inventor Jenan Kazim (pictured) To close the Kazbrella (pictured left) users pull it up, instead of pulling it down, as is the case with a conventional brolly (pictured right)","Device was invented by 61-year-old Jenan Kazim from Hertfordshire .

"By . Emily Payne for MailOnline . Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary once declared he was 'serious' about passengers being charged to use the toilet. But today marks a new horizon for the budget airline, as it unveils its own version of business class, offering professional fliers a number of travel benefits. The service, which will cost from €69.99 (£59.99), will include flexibility on ticket changes; 20kg checked-in bag allowance; fast track airport security at selected airports; priority boarding and premium seats. Scroll down for video . Customer improvements: More than 25 per cent of Ryanair passengers are travelling on business . More than 25 per cent of Ryanair's customers business travellers, and the airline says that Business Plus just one of several improvements they are making to refine their business service, with the lowest fares, biggest route network and more city airport routes. Business Plus passengers will get priority boarding and the chance to sit in 'premium' seats - near the exits, with more leg room, which the airline normally charge £15 to reserve. The carrier usually charges £90 to change a ticket, but Business Plus tickets allow passengers to change to another flight on the same day, to any airport in the same destination country, up to 40 minutes before departure for no extra fee. They will also be allowed to put a bag weighing up to 20kg in the hold, which would normally cost up to £75 on busy routes. Ryanair now offer savings for businesses of all sizes, says  Chief Marketing Officer, Kenny Jacobs . Ryanair's Chief Marketing Officer, Kenny Jacobs said: 'We now offer even more business routes, connecting Europe's major cities with additional flights and improved schedules, ensuring great savings for businesses of all sizes. 'Our commitment to the improvement of our customer experience under our ""Always Getting Better"" programme continues, following the introduction of allocated seating, a free second carry-on bag, reduced fees, a new website, a brand new app with mobile boarding passes, and our dedicated family service, Ryanair Family Extra.' 'The customer experience had a few rough edges that needed to be knocked off and we've done that.' The changes could spell further misery for traditional airlines that have never fully come to terms with Ryanair's  rise from small regional carrier to continental giant. Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary has praised easyJet for its success in attracting business travellers . Unable to fully replicate its ultra low-cost business model, most full-service airlines have been unable to cut prices far enough to stop an exodus of passengers and still turn a profit. Business users have been among the few willing to pay more for the travel perks they offer. 'As Ryanair relentlessly increases capacity and gradually broadens its target markets, the legacy carriers will feel the pain,' said Stephen Furlong, an analyst with Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin. 'They are showing this market is not only the preserve of legacy airlines.' Ryanair needs to capture more of the business market to achieve its goal of flying 120 million passengers per year by 2022. It estimates that around 20 million of its 83 million annual passengers are business travellers. To reach the target, it aims to increase that to between 30 million and 36 million. Rival easyJet, which Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary has praised for its success in attracting business travellers, has a 'flexible fare' from £54.99 that also includes 20kg of checked-in baggage, free date changes and fast-track security screening. Ryanair says there are limits to its transformation and it has no plans to extend free luggage to other fares or to introduce free food or lounge access to business passengers.","Business fliers to have flexibility on ticket changes and 20kg bag allowance .

"By . Chris Kitching for MailOnline . Some people will do anything for charity, even if it means stripping naked in freezing temperatures atop Africa's highest peak. That's exactly what cheeky Ben Boleyn did when he reached the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro after enduring treacherous conditions during a nine-day charity climb. The 18-year-old student scaled the 19,341-ft high mountain wearing full walking gear, including four layers of thermals, and then bared all for pictures after a friend bet him just 18 pence to streak at the peak in -12C weather. Scroll down for video... Bottoms up: Ben Boleyn shed his clothes on Mount Kilimanjaro's summit after a friend bet him just 18 pence . Grin and bare it: Ben Boleyn scaled Africa's highest mountain to raise money for Acorns Children's Hospice . Fully clothed: The 18-year-old student says he may strip naked when he visits Machu Picchu in Peru . Before the climb he raised £600 for Acorns Children's Hospice in Worcester, where he is a volunteer, but he has received hundreds more after posting his cheeky snaps on Facebook. He posed for 10 minutes in just his walking boots, bringing some life to the dormant volcanic mountain. 4 . The teen from Kingswinford, West Midlands, said: 'Everyone at the summit loved it and everyone was taking pictures of me and I had a bit of an audience. 'My parents were shocked at first but people seem to have donated more because of it, which is great. It is quite unique. 'I would do it again at other landmarks. I want to go to Machu Picchu next so maybe I will strip there too.' On top of the world: Ben Boleyn and a seven other climbers trekked an average of almost six miles a day . He got the idea from a fellow Acorns Children's Hospice volunteer, who snaps a picture of himself naked at every landmark he visits. Ben said: 'Once I was with the climb group I mentioned it in conversation and it just snowballed after that. 'Everyone kept talking about it and one climber bet me 500 Tanzanian shillings, which is about 18p, that I wouldn't do it. 'When we got to the top I had to do it so just thought why not, it was a once in a lifetime opportunity.' The temperature was between -10C and -12C when Ben Boleyn decided to streak on the mountain's peak . Take it off: People have donated hundreds of pounds since Ben Boleyn posted the snaps on Facebook . He added: 'It was between -10C and -12C but it didn't feel that cold, probably because of the adrenaline and we had just walked for six hours so I was already warm.' Ben scaled the mountain with seven other climbers after he spent four weeks volunteering at a hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. They trekked an average of almost six miles a day with a team of 31 porters. He said: 'The summit climb was the hardest part but walking for nine days in a row was challenging. 'Some days we would do a short three hour trek and an hour trek to acclimatise and other treks would be eight hours.' Breath-taking views: Climbers can see for miles when they reach the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro . He did it all to raise money for Acorns Children's Hospice and awareness of the 'fantastic' work that they do. 'I do voluntary work every week at Acorns Children's Hospice in Worcester so have seen the amazing work they do caring for terminally ill children first hand and everybody has a massive smile on their face most of the time.' Now that the climb is over, Ben is taking a gap year and hopes to study medicine at a university abroad before training to become a doctor. He recently finished his A-Levels at King Edward VI College in Stourbridge, where he got an A in chemistry, an A in human biology and a B in maths with statistics.","Ben Boleyn bared all atop Mount Kilimanjaro on a dare from a friend .

"By . Mail On Sunday . She is known for taking on some controversial – and revealing – acting roles. But Anna Friel has admitted she has managed to shock her parents only once – by emailing her father some pornographic images. The 36-year-old, who plays Jean Raymond, the wife of porn baron Paul Raymond, in a new film called The Look Of Love, made the embarrassing slip-up while she was researching her role. Friel accidentally sent pornographic images she was using for research to her father . Friel enjoys taking on a variety of complex and controversial roles, pictured here as Yelena in Uncle Vanya . ‘I sent an email to my dad with some pictures of Jean Raymond,’ she said. ‘He called me afterwards and said, “I think you’re going a bit far on this one.” ‘I wondered what he meant and then I realised I’d sent him an email attachment of an actual porn shoot that Jean did – I mean, everything. I was mortified.’ Anna Friel on the front cover of the latest edition of Easy Living . Friel, who first hit the headlines aged 16 for filming a lesbian kiss scene in Brookside, admitted her parents were not usually surprised by anything she did. ‘I was brought up in a very open household – I’m very close to my papa and he’s not easily shocked.’ And the actress, who also appeared naked in BBC drama The Tribe in 1998 and on stage in Breakfast At Tiffany’s four years ago, revealed that she has no problems baring all. ‘I didn’t mind being naked,’ she said in an interview in April’s edition of Easy Living magazine, which is accompanied by photographs of her taken by rock star Bryan Adams. ‘I’ve always been OK with my body. We’ve all got t**s. I’ve also got b***s – I just don’t show them very often.’ Friel, who has a daughter from a previous relationship with actor David Thewlis, said juggling the demands of motherhood and acting was a challenge: ‘I’m 36. My friends are freezing their eggs. It’s much harder to be a woman these days.

"By . Chris Kitching for MailOnline . Discount hotel chain Travelodge has apologised and offered refunds to guests whose overnight stay was disrupted when a huge water tank burst and a roof caved in. Thomas and Jennifer Weatherstone, from Carlisle, Cumbria, said they suffered a holiday nightmare when they and their young children – five-year-old Isla, four-year-old Harry and two-year-old Felix – were suddenly awakened by a fire alarm late at night at the Travelodge Oxford Peartree in Cutteslowe, just north of Oxford. The family was forced to move to a different room after waiting hours in the middle of the night, while other guests had to travel up to 30 miles away, and isn’t satisfied with the way Travelodge handled their situation. Nightmare: Thomas and Jennifer Weatherstone and their children were awakened by an alarm late at night . The Weatherstones put their children - Felix, Harry and Isla - in their car while they waited for a room . Guests were roused from their beds at about 11pm when a rooftop storage tank ruptured and water began to gush into the building. Mrs Weatherstone, 30, said: ‘I woke up again at midnight and when I opened the door to look into the corridor, part of the ceiling collapsed. ‘It was in the corridor about two rooms down from us, and water was coming through the hole in the ceiling.’ The Weatherstones loaded their children into their car and went to the front desk to find out what was going on. Hotel staff told them the section of the building where they were staying had been deemed dangerous and they wouldn’t be allowed to spend the rest of the night in their room. Mrs Weatherstone said: ‘At no point through the whole thing did anyone tell us to evacuate.’ Because there was limited availability in the rest of the hotel, guests who were staying in 47 rooms in the ‘dangerous’ area were forced to go to Travelodge hotels in Bicester and High Wycombe. After waiting more than three hours, the Weatherstones, who were visiting family in Faringdon, were told they could have a single room in the ‘safe section’ of the hotel, but there was only one bed for the family of five. Sorry: Travelodge has apologised and offered full refunds and compensation to guests . Mrs Weatherstone said: ‘There was no seating, no refreshments, no information, no apology, nothing. It was very unprofessional. ‘We were planning on staying for another night but we just got in the car in the morning and drove home with hardly any sleep. I feel so angry.’ Travelodge has since apologised and given the family a £39 refund, £100 in vouchers and £175 in compensation. Company spokeswoman Sophia Mead said the fire alarm went off three times, the hotel was evacuated and the situation was explained to guests. She said: ‘The water tank was fixed the following day and all customers staying at the hotel that night have been refunded in full and compensated. ‘We would like to assure Mrs Weatherstone that the safety of our customers and staff is paramount to us.’","Part of the building in Cutteslowe was deemed dangerous for guests .

"By . Rebecca Brett for MailOnline . An American Lego master  has recreated the iconic Fawlty Towers hotel lobby completely out of plastic bricks. Nathan Feist, the 21-year-old constructor, has succeeded where Basil Fawlty failed and brought a semblance of functionality to the most dysfunctional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay on the 'English Riviera'. The intricately detailed model, made for the annual BrickFair Lego convention in Virginia,  includes the staircase, lobby and reception area from the set of the classic comedy. In order to get a true representation of the hotel lobby Nathan had watched the 1970s sitcom many times on Netflix . Hints referring to 'The Germans' episode have been captured in the model, with the moose head and its drooping antler, as well as the fire alarm and extinguisher. Manhattan-born Feist, a student at Cornell University in New York, chose the classic seventies sitcom, starring John Cleese, because he wanted to pay homage to one of his favourite television series - that he could exhibit at the convention. 'I had already seen a Counter Strike map that recreated the Fawlty Towers hotel and which was featured on Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe, but I couldn't find any LEGO models of the hotel posted online' Nathan said. Nathan Feist chose the classic seventies sitcom because he wanted to pay homage to one of his favourite television series .

The police watchdog has slammed a force which made a string of failures over a cyclist’s death - including saying it was an accident after just 15 minutes' investigation. Richard Jordan, 67, was hurled from his bicycle in a country lane almost three years ago, dying of catastrophic head injuries. Yet paramedics did not tell police the crash had happened until a day later and, when they did investigate, they indicated there was 'no third party involvement' after 15 minutes - before they had visited the scene or interviewed any witnesses. It then emerged at Mr Jordan’s inquest . that the two main witnesses argued during their 999 call about whether . their car had hit him. Mr . Jordan's widow Sue, 66, who lives near Ashford, Kent, has called for the . investigation to be reopened ever since and fears she will never know . exactly how her husband died. She . complained to Kent Police, and the force carried out an internal probe which confirmed a number of failings in the . investigation - including forensic evidence being lost when a bag . containing his clothes was left open. But she claimed the internal probe did not go far enough, and complained to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). Now the IPCC has upheld her complaint, ordering Kent Police to reinvestigate many aspects of how it dealt with Mrs Jordan's complaint. Many decisions in the original probe into Mr Jordan's death also come under fire . in the IPCC report, which has been seen by MailOnline. It said paramedics’ decision not to tell police about the crash had compromised any hope the family had of knowing how Mr Jordan died. 'The . delay would undoubtedly have been detrimental’, it said, ‘most . significantly due to the potential loss of opportunities to seize . forensic evidence at the scene.’ Grief: Mr Jordan's widow Sue (left with her son Neil) has battled Kent Police for almost three years. Now an IPCC report has upheld her complaint against the force and told officers to look at aspects of the case again . 'Bungling': Retired BT engineer Mr Jordan died of catastrophic head injuries after coming off his bicycle in a country lane. Police were initially not told about the accident at all by paramedics for more than 24 hours . The report then questioned why it took four days before the force took a statement from the car driver who dialled 999. And it questioned why they did not seize their car itself, which has since been scrapped. 'The . vehicle had been involved with an incident which had led to a man's . death,’ the report said, yet police gave ‘no explanation’ for it not . being taken away. Damage was . found on the front bumper, but the owner ‘apparently accounted for this . damage as being present on the vehicle when he purchased it. 'This explanation appears to have been accepted... however, it is unclear on what basis [the PC] reached this view. 'It appears that [he] discounted the possibility of a direct collision from the outset'. The car's driver, the report said, 'appears to have potentially provided inaccurate information relating to the vehicle history. 'However, . it does not appear that this has been subject to any significant . scrutiny by the officers investigating the collision.' Country lane: The crash happened in this lane close to Mr Jordan's village home near Ashford, Kent . Care: Mr Jordan cycled the same route five times a week after being bought a bicycle for his 50th birthday. An internal investigation also found forensic evidence was lost when a bag containing his clothes was left open . Kent . Police has also been ordered to reinvestigate the family's claims that . officers were 'rude' and 'condescending' towards them. And . the report said there was not enough evidence that the force had . learned lessons from the row, suggesting more officers could be . reprimanded. It added: 'At . this stage, it is not possible to determine whether or not any officer . has a case to answer for misconduct or gross misconduct, as your . complaints have not been sufficiently investigated.' Three officers received 'management action' over the row, but the family were not told what that was. Mrs Jordan said the IPCC report vindicated her three-year campaign and was ‘absolutely brilliant’. She . told MailOnline: ‘All through this process we’ve had nobody listen to . us and it’s a sense of relief that someone’s taken our complaints . seriously and agreed. ‘We . will never stop fighting until we get justice. If it gets to the point . where police are found to have carried out a flawed investigation then I . think we should have a fresh inquest. A life together: Mr and Mrs Jordan on their wedding day in 1967 (left) and before he died in November 2011 . Bond: Mr Jordan pictured with his son Neil before his death in 2011. The family say they find it hard to grieve . ‘We can’t grieve. I can’t get any of it out of my head. We’ve had to keep reliving it and reliving it for the last three years.’ Retired . BT engineer Mr Jordan, who was married to Sue for 44 years, took up . cycling after his children bought him a bike for his 50th birthday. The . pensioner suffered a seven-inch fracture to his skull despite wearing a . helmet when he crashed on November 24, 2011 near his home in Old Wives . Lees, Kent. He was taken to hospital where he was ruled unfit for surgery and died later the same day. But . paramedics did not tell police and they only found out more than 24 . hours after the crash - by which time the scene had long since been . cleared. Fifteen minutes . after being told and before they interviewed any witnesses or visited . the scene, police said no third party had been involved - a decision the . force has since admitted was wrong. Changes: Ambulance chiefs in the south east have altered their policy on cyclists since Mr Jordan died . The report said it was 'not possible to determine whether or not any officer has a case to answer for misconduct or gross misconduct, as your complaints have not been sufficiently investigated' Consequences: The IPCC noted that one of the crash investigators was not fully-qualified at the time . Yet . because of the way the complaints system worked, Mr Jordan's family had . to wait until after an inquest recorded his death as an accident before . their concerns could be addressed. And . at the inquest they were shocked to hear the distressing 999 call, in . which the car's driver could be heard arguing with his girlfriend . passenger about whether the car hit Mr Jordan. The woman could be heard saying: 'The back end of the bike hit us', to which he . replied: 'No it didn't, we didn't hit him at all. He came off and then . we hit the bike, we went over the bike. That was what happened because . he just absolutely lost it.' Happy family: The cyclist with his wife and son Paul . Police listened to the call and decided not to re-interview the pair. The family had called for . prosecutors to investigate the force's conduct, but the IPCC said that part of their complaint could not be supported as . there was no evidence of a criminal offence by police. One . small victory for the family, however, was that the South East Coast . Ambulance Service has now changed its policy because of the case to tell . police immediately whenever a cyclist is hit. The . move was hailed as a small step forward in the rights of cyclists, more . than 3,000 of whom were seriously injured on Britain's roads last year - . alongside 109 who died. Mrs . Jordan said: ‘I feel what we did with getting the ambulance process . changed will help other cyclists, and I feel what we’re doing now is . fighting for other people who’ve gone through the same thing.’ A . force spokesman told MailOnline: ‘Kent Police is very sorry that the . family of Richard Jordan didn’t feel they received the service they . deserved from Kent Police. The issues raised by the IPCC make . disappointing reading and raise a number of concerns that we are taking . very seriously. ‘We will be . reinvestigating the family’s complaints and further review the evidence . already gathered. As directed by the IPCC, this will be to establish . whether the original recommendations were sufficient or whether there . are any failings that have not been identified so far. We will of course . keep the family updated at all stages of this review. ‘We . will endeavour to do everything we can to rectify this difficult . situation and our sympathy is with Richard Jordan’s family following . their very sad loss.’","Richard Jordan, 67, hurled from his bike in country lane near Ashford, Kent .

The plane was taken out of service and fumigated after it landed at New Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport from the city of Ranchi yesterday, the Times of India reported. It is at least the fourth reported sighting on an Air India aircraft this year. Scroll down for video . Rats on a plane: There have been at least four rodent sightings on Air India flights this year . Earlier this month, cabin crew spotted rats scurrying free in the rear half of a plane as it landed at Indira Gandhi International Airport from Calcutta. The Airbus A321 was carrying about 200 passengers and staff, and it was removed from service and taken to a remote airport bay to be fumigated. In May, the pilot on a flight from New Delhi to London reported a rat in the cockpit, the newspaper reported. But there are conflicting reports about whether a rat was actually on board. Rats were blamed after a domestic flight from Mumbai suffered a two-hour delay in February. Planes must be fumigated even when there is an unconfirmed sighting because the rodents pose a serious threat to the safety of passengers and crew. An Air India aircraft that flew from Ranchi to New Delhi had to be fumigated after a rat was reported on board . Rats can chew on electrical wires and disrupt computer systems aboard an aircraft. The rodents normally sneak onto aircraft via catering vehicles loaded with food. Last year, health inspectors in China found nearly a dozen rats underneath a business class seat after a commercial flight landed at Xiamen Gaoqi International Airport from Hong Kong. Inspectors wearing protective suits and masks boarded the plane and searched through overhead storage bins and behind seats. In 2009, an Air India flight from Amritsar to Toronto was delayed for nearly half a day as staff tried to catch a rat that was spotted on board. The flight was delayed while a replacement aircraft was flown in.","Rodent was reportedly spotted on a plane that flew in from Ranchi .

"By . Mia De Graaf for MailOnline . An 18-year-old has died after allegedly tombstoning into a disused quarry in a new take on the 'ice bucket challenge'. Cameron Lancaster was found in Preston Hill Quarry in Inverkeithing, Fife, after a four-hour search in the deep water. Police were called to the disused site shortly before 5pm on Sunday, where the teenager is thought to have spent the day with friends. It is claimed he jumped feet-first into the water in response to the internet craze that has seen people around the globe pour buckets of ice water over their head for charity. Tragic: Cameron Lancaster, 18, was found in a quarry after allegedly tombstoning for the ice bucket challenge . Discovered: His body was pulled from Preston Hill Quarry in Inverkeithing, Fife, at 9pm on Sunday . Emergency services were sent to the scene and the man's body was recovered at about 9pm. Mr Lancaster was believed to be from Burntisland, around seven miles from the scene. The quarry is a popular site for 'tombstoning', an activity where people jump feet-first off a cliff into shallow water. In a statement released by Police Scotland, his family said: 'Cameron died in a tragic accident. His death is such a great loss. 'During his short life, he touched so many people with his friendliness, kindness and thoughtful generosity of spirit. He will be hugely missed by his family and friends. 'The family are finding it hard to come to terms with this sudden loss and would ask for privacy at this sad time.' A police spokesman said: 'Inquiries are under way to establish the full circumstances of what happened and Police Scotland's thoughts are with the family at this very difficult time.' SNP councillor Alice McGarry, who lives just 150 yards from the quarry, said she knew a number of new tombstoning videos had been posted on YouTube this week. Tributes: People paid tribute to the 'generous and thoughtful' teenager who was said to have jumped 80 feet . They show youngsters plummeting up to 80 feet into the water. The councillor added that she had seen numerous youngsters in the area over the weekend. The tragedy comes two years after the Coastguard condemned tombstoning in the quarry, branding it 'foolhardy and dangerous'. Mrs McGarry said: 'Because we live so close to the quarry we were aware of what was going on. 'In fact my husband and daughters had just been picking brambles nearby before it all kicked off. 'There were fire tenders, ambulances, the police helicopter. At first we heard someone had broken their back and someone had jumped in to save him. 'But then we just heard it was a teenager. 'There have been one or two incidents. It's 30-plus years since there was a fatality at the quarry. Whatever happened, it's really awful. Really upsetting.' Found: Emergency services reached the site in Inverkeithing, south Scotland, by helicopter . Locals posted tributes and speculated about the cause of the boy's death on Twitter. Rory Fell said: 'Crazy about that lad from Inverkeithing, thoughts go out to his family and pals alike. Euan Donaldson wrote: 'Tragic to hear a boy died at inverkeithing quarry today. Apparently was trying to do the ice bucket challenge. Thoughts are with his family.'

The jumper is given a countdown before taking the plunge into the water.

But a shearing has been especially welcome for Shaun - the sheep who was found wandering the island state of Tasmania with one of the world's heaviest ever fleeces. The gigantic sheep has now shed 23.5kg of wool, enough to make 40 jumpers and just shy of the world record set by another lost sheep ten years ago. Scroll down for video . Before: Shaun the sheep - who was found wandering on a Tasmanian farm - has finally had a haircut, shedding 23.5kg in one of the heaviest fleeces ever sheared from a single sheep. He is pictured just before it took place . After: Aah, that's better! Shaun appeared spindly and trembling after his haircut at the hands of Mr and Mrs Hazell - with thin legs for an animal that was previously carrying the weight of a seven-year-old child . Farmers Peter and Netty Hazell found the six-year-old ram in scrubland on Sunday and nicknamed him Shaun after the character from the TV series Wallace and Gromit. 'He couldn't see very well because of the wool over his face, so I snuck up behind him and grabbed him,' Mr Hazell told ABC News. Shaun's tag suggests he is from a farm hundreds of kilometres away on Tasmania's east coast, meaning he has been wandering across the state for years. 'It is the heaviest sheep I've ever lifted,' said Mr Hazell's wife Netty. 'I just couldn't believe it, I just could not believe a sheep could have so much wool.' Hard work: Shaun during his haircut in the Midlands region of Tasmania. He was almost the world's heaviest . Gigantic: Shaun earlier this week. Farmer Peter Hazell managed to pounce on him because he could not see . Also amazing was that Shaun was able to survive in the wild for so long. 'Usually they get cast and can't get up, or they get fly-struck or the hot weather gets to them,' Mr Hazell said. Shaun's haircut today revealed a trembling, spindly animal under his mass of hair. It must have been a shock to the animal, as his fleece has become one of the heaviest ever sheared from a single sheep. But it does not beat the world record, which is held by a New Zealander named Shrek. The merino shot to international fame in 2004 after he avoided being caught and shorn for six years. Merinos are normally shorn annually, but Shrek apparently hid in caves, avoiding muster. His fleece weighed an astonishing 27kg, and he was even taken to meet New Zealand's Prime Minister.

"By . Stephen Mcgowan for the Daily Mail . John Guidetti is exposing the inside of his arm. The skin from the sleeve of his designer t-shirt down to his right hand is embedded with tattoos painted in green ink. Amongst young footballers this is the norm. The in-thing. Laughing, the Swedish international says his mother disapproves, but rejects any accusations of vanity or pandering to dressing-room culture. Instead he points in the direction of some lyrics embedded in his upper from a song by Jamaican reggae artist Tarrus Riley. VIDEO Scroll down to watch John Guidetti on Celtic move and troubles at Manchester City . John Guidetti poses with Celtic manager Ronny Deila after joining on loan from Manchester City . ‘Everything here is history to do with injuries,’ he explained. ‘The lyrics here are from a song I listened to in my dark times. I don’t think you’ll know the song but it says “We all cry but when the tears dry we get stronger.”’ Later, a Google check reveals that the song is titled ‘Stronger.’ After two years of abject frustration and doubt, a period which drained the overflow of self confidence which spills from Celtic’s new on-loan new striker, Guidetti uses them to reinforce his belief that bad things happen for a reason. It was his 20th birthday when his girlfriend and some friends organised a surprise party. He felt on top of the world. An outstanding season of hero worship on loan at Feyenoord had brought 20 goals in 23 appearances and the kind of adulation which can turn a young man’s head. Midway through the night he felt ill and left early. It might have been a piece of chicken he ate, but a 10-day stomach bug was violent and unforgiving. He lost his balance and doctors carried out further tests, discovering the antibodies inside his stomach were attacking the nervous system. He lost all strength in his leg and surrendered his sense of balance. The Swedish striker Guidetti was told by Manuel Pellegrini that he should leave City to further his career . There were times, surely, when he thought his career was over. ‘Not over,’ he responds, a crumpled Celtic No 9 shirt in hand. ‘I always knew I’ d come back but I didn’t know how long it would take. ‘It’s made me stronger. Maybe when I’m old and wise I’m going to sit there and think it was a great thing that happened to me. You see many of these young players whose careers go from nothing to wow in a matter of seconds, it’s easy to fly away and think you’re better than you are. ‘Maybe you forget to go into the gym before training or stay out after for extra minutes. ‘Football goes quickly if you don’t keep on top of it. So maybe this was meant to be and I try to stay on top of my game and not fly away. Even if I have a great performance I keep working hard and stay motivated. This was meant to be.’ In his national team colours John Guidetti has continued to shine despite his injury troubles . In total he missed two years of football. Reared playing street football on the outskirts of Nairobi, Guidetti could cope because he has a background and intelligence unusual in a footballer. ‘It was a difficult time. It was a leg injury, I don’t know the exact medical terms but it kept me out for a long time. It stopped me going to the European Championships in 2012. ‘I had a great season in Holland, my career was looking bright to say the least. Then this injury came. ‘It was a virus. I think they say 1 in 10 million people get it. I’m not sure what it was but it was unfortunate to get it at such a time. To play with my national team in Ukraine would have been amazing. ‘But it wasn’t meant to be, so we’ll go for France instead. ‘If you give up then I don’t think you deserve to be a footballer because it’s the greatest thing in the world. I’m not going to give up now.’ Even so, there were some bleak, desperate days. Guidetti scored a stunning free-kick for Sweden Under 21s last week as he continued his return to form . ‘It was the darkest time ever,’ he reflected, ‘But I got a great help from City’ s medical team and the close people around me. They always believed in me to come back.’ A stunning strike for Sweden’s under-21 side in a 3-0 win over Greece in midweek suggested he is on his way. But the Glasgow jury is harsher than most. Guidetti may be fit, but a loan to Stoke City last season was unsatisfactory for both parties. At Parkhead, Guidetti feels compelled to show he still has the explosive ability which persuaded Roberto Martini to sign him for Manchester City. ‘What’s unfair is that I did well then I was injured for two years,’ he says of suggestions he has failed to fulfil his early promise. ‘I had an unfortunate spell at Stoke. But again I was never really given a chance. If I’d played 10 games for no goals then fine, that would’ve been a chance not taken. ‘But to come off the bench, for 10 minutes here and there, is difficult. The young forward shoots during a Manchester City friendly but has not made a first-team impact . ‘Look at the games I’ve played lately. I played four games for the national team under-21s and I’ve scored four goals. That I think is not bad.’ As a teenager he loved Henrik Larsson. After some talk he won’t take the fabled No 7 shirt of his countryman, but the legacy of Celtic’s modern-day icon was a powerful incentive to reject the likes of Ajax and Olympiakos. ‘That’s one of the reasons. Not Henrik’s legacy but the fact he stayed for so many years, scoring goals after goals after goals. If you score so many goals and have such a big impact as he did later in his career, when he went to United and Barcelona, for him to choose to stay so many years it must be an amazing club. ‘I’ve never heard anything bad about it. I remember some of the boys in the dressing room at City said on a Champions Leauge night Celtic Park is the best atmosphere in the world.’ These are changed days, of course. Celtic crowds in the Europa League will be a source of intrigue. Guidetti’s capture, albeit on loan, went some way towards offering an olive branch to a support disenfranchised by a perceived lack of spending from the boardroom. Yet the Swede’s enthusiasm is infectious. Here is a player hellbent on bringing them all back. Guidetti was out for two years with various troubles including a virus that affects one in ten million people . ‘Nothing negative entered my mind about Scottish football. I am at one of the biggest clubs in the world. ‘I’m a bit of a freak when it comes to fans. I love fans. ‘Take them away and what is football, really? It’s not the same, nowhere near. ‘It’s the feeling to score in front of 50,000 fans is incredible. It’s hard to describe. For me it’s the best feeling in the world.’ He ducks questions on a permanent stay. His Man City contract is up next summer. He could sign an agreement with Celtic in January if he wished, but the events of recent years make predictions and assumptions a dangerous business for John Guidetti. ‘Manuel Pellegrini said to me: “John listen, for your own best and your career you need to play. To be fourth choice here is not going to cut it for you.”’ ‘I felt the same. I want to play football and to play for Celtic is great. That’ s all I’m thinking about. I can’t think too much ahead. I have to stay focused.’","Manchester City loanee missed two years with virus and injuries .

"By . Leon Watson for MailOnline . A top Buckingham Palace official appeared court today accused of receiving more than £100,000 in bribes in return for awarding contracts for work at royal palaces. Ron Harper, 62, was deputy property manager at the Royal Household from 1994 until his suspension in 2012. It is alleged that between 2006 and 2011, company directors bribed Harper in return for him awarding them large contracts for work at the palaces. Ron Harper, the Queen's former deputy property manager, arrives at Southwark Crown Court where he faces charges for receiving payments to award contracts for work at Royal Palaces . The maintenance work at Buckingham Palace, St James's Palace and Kensington Palace, was funded by the Civil List, now called the Sovereign Grant, and came straight out of taxpayer's pockets. Harper, who was made a Member of the Royal Victorian Order by the Queen in 2004, appeared at Southwark Crown Court with eight other men and one woman, who are yet to enter pleas. Harper, from Sudbury, Suffolk, is charged with four counts of conspiracy to give and receive corrupt payments. Steven Thompson, 60, of Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, and Bernard Gackowski, 61, of Keyworth, Nottinghamshire, former directors of Melton Power Services, are both charged with one count of conspiracy to give and receive corrupt payments and one count of conspiracy to commit fraud by abuse of position. The Queen's former deputy property manager has been charged with taking more than £100,000 in kickbacks to award contracts ultimately funded by taxpayers . Ronald Harper, 61, is said to have handed out huge contracts for mechanical and electrical work at Buckingham Palace, St James’s Palace and Kensington Palace, pictured . Glyn Orridge, 65, of Melton Mowbray, a director of GO Power, and Matthew Neath, 34, of Melton Mowbray, a director of Borrough Property Services, are both charged with one count of conspiracy to commit fraud by abuse of position. David Woodhams, 46, of Stanmer Village, Brighton, a former director of DWEC, Aseai Zlaoui, 39, of Witham, Essex, and Christopher Murphy, 54, of Witham, Essex, directors of BSI Nordale, and Harry Howard, 80, of Chadderton, a director of Atlantic 2000, are all charged with one count of conspiracy to give and receive corrupt payments. Alan Rollinson, 65, of Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, a relative of Harper's, is charged with one count of converting or transferring criminal property. They are all due to next appear at Southwark Crown Court on November 28, for a plea and case management hearing.

"By . Stephen Mcgowan for MailOnline . Scott Brown is poised to hand Celtic - and Scotland - a huge boost by returning to action three weeks ahead of schedule against Aberdeen on Saturday. But Ronny Deila is facing a fresh injury blow with the news that midfielder Charlie Mulgrew faces weeks on the sidelines with a knee problem which could require surgery. Skipper Brown was expected to be absent for three months after sustaining a hamstring problem in July. However, as he prepares to hand debuts to strikers John Guidetti and Stefan Scepovic against the Dons at Parkhead, Deila says Brown’s quicker-than-expected return feels like having another new player. ‘Scott looks very well. He could maybe play on Saturday,’ said the Celtic boss. Celtic's Scott Brown could return from injury three weeks early against Aberdeen on Saturday . ‘We are talking here about new signings but to also get injured players back is great. ‘Everybody knows how important Scott is to this team. He looks good and needs minutes under his belt. ‘It’s tough to get players the minutes they need at the top level to get their fitness back. But when we do that I see a very good team here.’ Brown sustained his injury in a pre-season match against Rapid Vienna and initial projections predicted a three-month lay-off. His comeback will also be welcomed by national team Gordon Strachan ahead of next month’s Euro 2016 double header with Georgia and Poland, with Deila reporting: ‘Scott is training with the team well now. It’s positive and his body is improving quick so that’s good.’ Club captain Brown was expected to be out for three months after sustaining a hamstring problem in July . The news is less positive for Deila and Strachan on Mulgrew, Brown’s club and country midfield partner. After watching Mulgrew sent off in contentious circumstances by a Norwegian referee in Scotland’s 2-1 defeat to Germany last Sunday, Deila only wishes the red card flashed by his countryman had come earlier than the last minute. ‘Charlie is struggling with his knee now. I don’t know how long that is going to take to get better. That’s not positive. ‘It could be some weeks. He has a meniscus problem with his knee and it could need surgery, but I hope we don’t need to do that.’ Pleased to have a settled squad after the drama of transfer deadline day, Deila promises new faces against Derek McInnes’ Dons side. Ronny Delia said Scott Brown needed minutes under his belt after such a long lay-off . Virgil van Dijk will also be restored to the first-team squad after bids for his services from Sunderland and Southampton were rejected – to the defender’s chagrin. Left out of the 1-1 draw with Dundee as a result, the Dutchman spoke to Deila yesterday and assured fans the defender’s head is in the right place for the season ahead. ‘He (Van Dijk) is very happy now. He’s just become a dad and he’s been with his national team for the first time. ‘He was a little bit disappointed for a couple of days after the window closed. People want things and he was thinking he had the opportunity to go to the English Premier League. ‘But that wasn’t possible and he knows now he has a lot of challenges here as well. He is a very important player for Celtic and he has to take it as a positive. The way I saw him in training today, he has taken it fantastically well. ‘He has to understand how important he is. He is such an unbelievably good player for us. That’s something he has to be glad about. We would have said: “Go away, we don’t want you.” That would have been worse.’ Scotland and Celtic's Charlie Mulgrew (right) could require knee surgery in a blow for the club . Deila admits Celtic had to play hardball on deadline day, adding: ‘There was interest in him. But it was not even close to what we are thinking about. Also, we were not interested in selling him anyway. He is one of the players we are going to build a new team around. ‘He hasn’t said anything to me about speaking about it again in January. Again, you can never plan in football. Tomorrow, he could be injured or he could start playing fantastic and become a regular in the national team for Holland. ‘He has things to work on to get improvement. He played very well against Maribor, the standard he played was Champions League level. That’s why he was picked for Holland. So if he continues that, he will get his chances. ‘He said that to me as well, that if he plays good matches for Celtic, he will get opportunities. ‘I have no concerns about his commitment. I can honestly say I’m really happy about his situation and have no concerns. I can see his body language and he is happy. Now he is focused on getting good results with Celtic and getting better.’ BLOB: Celtic defender Marcus Fraser has agreed to join Jimmy Nicholl’s Cowdenbeath on loan to obtain first-team experience.","Scott Brown could return for Celtic on Saturday against Aberdeen .

"By . Joel Christie for MailOnline . The Consumer Product Safety Commission will likely ban the small but dangerous high-powered magnets known as 'Buckyballs' from the market after one child died another 7,700 were taken to the emergency after swallowing them. The startling figures were released this week as part of a proposed final rule to rid the rare-earth magnets from the shelves completely. Anything considered to be of choking hazard size would be removed as part of the recommendation, which will be decided by vote later this month, according to USA Today. The proposal follows the death of 19-month-old Annaka Chaffin, who swallowed seven of the balls from a necklace her brothers brought home from school last August. Tragic: Annaka Chaffin was only 19-months-old when we swallowed seven 'Buckyballs' from a necklace and died. Some 7,700 other children have been rushed to hospital for doing the same thing, a report moving to ban the magnets has revealed. Dangerous: Buckyballs come in a set of 216 rare-earth magnets that are extremely strong and can be manipulated into sculptures and chain jewelry . Annaka was found unresponsive and bleeding from the mouth and nose. According to the final rule, an autopsy showed the magnets had become attached to one another in her small intestine, which perforated her bowel and caused it to become septic. 'This case illustrates how difficult it is to diagnose the injuries associated with ingested magnets: the symptoms seemed to indicate a common stomach ailment or poisoning,' the CPC staff report said, according to USA Today. The Consumer Product Safety Commission will allow magnets that do not fit through a certain cylinder to remain on the market. In July a type of the magnets, made by the popular brand Buckyballs, were recalled. Buckyballs founder, Craig Zucker, dissolved the Buckyballs company in December 2012. However he now has a new company, United We Ball, which is believed to have the only magnetic product that would be allowed under the proposed new rule. In December, a Florida teen was rushed to hospital after accidentally swallowing two of the magnets. Christin Rivas, 14, was given six of the magnets by a church friend just before Thanksgiving, and took them to her school in Melbourne to 'freak out' her friends with tricks such as pulling a pen up a wall from a neighboring classroom. However while going to the bathroom she put them in her mouth, and when someone in the next stall made her laugh, she accidentally swallowed them. Life-saving surgery: Doctors removed rare-earth . magnets from 14-year-old Christin Rivas' small intestine after she accidentally . swallowed two Buckyballs in December . Not a toy: Magnet-related emergency room visits have increased five times since 2002, and been linked with one death . Buckyballs come in a set of 216 magnets that can be manipulated into sculptures and chain jewelry. After three days in hospital, the balls had become stuck in Rivas' small intestine, risking perforation and infection of the tissue. The balls she swallowed were made of neodymium - a material that begins to chip and erode in stomach acid. After five days in hospital, Christin was finally released. Rare-earth magnets pose 'unique health hazards to children,' according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since 2003, one death and 19 injuries - often requiring gastrointestinal surgery - have been reported. Between 2002 and 2011, magnet-related emergency room visits among people under 21 increased five fold - a total of 22,500 cases. Irresistible: The tiny magnets have proven tempting for children and kids swallowing them or putting them up their noses has resulted in a huge increase in magnet-related injuries .","Annaka Chaffin died last August after swallowing seven small magnet balls from a necklace her brothers gave her .

"By . Tamara Cohen for the Daily Mail . Drunks who abuse staff in A&E departments should be fined £50, health minister Norman Lamb has said . Drunks who abuse staff in A&E departments should be fined £50, health minister Norman Lamb has said. Those who ‘gratuitously’ consume too much alcohol, especially at the weekends, are putting a ‘huge’ burden on hospitals according to the senior Liberal Democrat. He wants on-the-spot fines for them, starting with those who are ‘abusive’ to medical staff, and can make A&E feel like a ‘war zone’. Mr Lamb said: ‘There’s an issue with youngsters drinking too much. It’s having a massive impact on people’s health and the consequences for them further down the line are enormous. ‘The health service is under a lot of pressure and we all have a responsibility to the NHS to make sure it is sustainable and we don’t abuse the fact that it’s a freely available service – a principle I strongly endorse. ‘But it can be like a war zone there late on Friday night. If someone is drunk and abusive they have to feel there are some consequences to that.’ Mr Lamb is putting the policy forward for the Lib Dems’ election manifesto. If his colleagues back it, it could be implemented if the party end up in a second coalition next year. He suggested a fine of £50 per incident, adding that with the right safeguards he did not believe the measure would lead to a ‘slippery slope’ of charges for other patients seen to have behaved irresponsibly. NHS staff would have to use the power sparingly – and not fine people who are alcoholics seeking treatment, or people with mental health problems who may appear abusive. But doctors said the proposal was unworkable, and that many people who turn up at emergency departments drunk are also injured, or have other health conditions. Mr Lamb said: ‘It’s important for a Liberal party to make clear that with freedom comes responsibility. ‘This is not about alcoholics, or people with mental health problems,’ he said. ‘It’s very important that they are referred automatically for the right treatment. ‘Staff would have to exercise discretion, and there would of course be a right of appeal if it was wrongly used in this way. ‘It’s about getting faster referrals for people with alcoholism or mental health problems, while tackling those who gratuitously drink far too much.’ Those who 'gratuitously' consume too much alcohol, especially at the weekends, are putting a 'huge' burden on hospitals according to the senior Liberal Democrat . Alcohol-related hospital admissions have risen sharply over the past decade in the UK. There are now one million per year – and alcohol costs the taxpayer £3.5billion every year. There were nearly 60,000 physical assaults on NHS staff in 2011/12. Gordon Miles, chief executive of the College of Emergency Medicine said: ‘It would be very tricky, and I haven’t seen a proposal that would be workable. What if someone is injured as well as being inebriated? ‘For example they had a couple of glasses of wine, fell and really hurt themselves? The priority is treating them. ‘It’s all very well saying these people are a huge burden on hospitals which they are, and A&E staff do face challenging situations. But there are many other ways we need to tackle alcohol abuse before it gets  to hospital. ‘It’s also very difficult to isolate who would be liable, as people with depression or mental health problems can drink to alleviate the symptoms. And practically, would you have to take the money first, from a drunk person, or take a credit card? Or if it’s a case of collecting it afterwards, then for £50, the effort needed to chase it up might become uneconomic.’ Charges for A&E apply elsewhere. In Ireland, patients must pay 100 euros (£80) if they do not have a referral  letter from a GP, with limited exemptions. Northern Ireland’s health minister Edwin Poots has also backed charging drink and drug abusers at A&E. Comment – Page 14 .","Norman Lamb says gratuitous consumption ‘huge’ burden on hospitals .

"By . Taylor Lorenz For Mailonline . A new female-only social network hopes to offer a space where women can speak freely without the interference of men. Former Facebook employee Susan Johnson founded Women.com as a stripped-down question and answer forum where users can discuss careers, relationships, health, sex, beauty, parenthood, politics, fashion and more. One anonymous conversation topic is featured daily, Slate reports, and all members of the Women.com community are able to weigh in.Members simply upvote the most relevant answers. Scroll down for video . Not her first rodeo: Before founding female-only social network Women.com, Susan Johnson spent two-and-a-half years working in global marketing at Facebook . Current questions range from, 'Have You Ever Slept Your Way Into (or Out of) Something?' to 'Do You Feel Bad For Victims of the iCloud Nude Photo Hack?' While other users beg for advice: 'Need Help With Liquid Eyeliner!' or 'Hair do Hell'. A well organized community management team keeps the site free of trolling and misogyny and fosters conversations about tough issues in a ‘well-lit, positive manner’. And if a man tries to join the ladies' club? ‘We’ve had a couple of men try to break in, and we just escort them out,’ says Johnson. The site is invite-only and users gain access via Facebook Connect, limiting potential for men to gain access via fake profiles. Transgender women who identify as female, she adds, are 100per cent welcome. Unlike Facebook, which focuses on photo sharing and status updates, Johnson chose to organize her network around questions and answers because she believes a good question is the foundation of a great conversation between female friends. No boys allowed! The women-only social network seeks to foster the type of conversations women have when men aren't around . ‘Today’s main question [“Friend’s husband is cheating. Do I say something?”] was really interesting,’ Johnson says. ‘I don’t think anyone would ever post that on Facebook, and it’s a true dilemma.’ ‘You can Google that stuff, and Yahoo Answers will be your only result, and you won’t know who you’re talking to, and the answer will be somewhat … illiterate. Or the question about how to raise a daughter who respects herself—you can ask that on Facebook, but you won't get access to this larger community of women with experience.’ Given that female users account for 58per cent of Facebook and 84per cent of Pinterest, Women.com shouldn’t have trouble attracting an audience. The site is currently in an invite-only beta stage, but Johnson hopes to open it up to the general public soon. She also plans to grow the site into a more complex network. She hopes to include interest segmentation and develop microcommunities around different topics so members can have side discussions about articles they find interesting, events in their area, or books they’re reading. Quora-style expertise identifiers are also in the works. ‘On Facebook, we’re talking with seemingly everyone, so we’re not necessarily sharing our thoughts on the Middle East, or even what we bought at Nordstrom.’ Johnson says. She hopes these women-only conversations will foster a different type of discussion that is currently difficult to have online.","Women.com is a new question and answers-based social network .

Britain risks becoming a nation of ‘disposable pets’ unless high street shops are stopped from selling puppies and kittens, an MP said today. Labour's Robert Flello said the Government needed to tackle the ‘puppy farms’ which sell animals to pet shops. He said these breeders often mistreat puppies and kittens and separate them from their mothers at an early age, which leads to life-threatening problems including infectious diseases and poor immune systems. Puppies should not be 'farmed' and sold in 'pet supermarkets', the Labour MP Robert Flello told the House of Commons today . Mr Flello said a nation of animal lovers should not risk becoming 'a nation with disposable pets'. He called for a ban on the sale of puppies and kittens in high street shops . Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke told the House of Commons that his pet dog Boris had become better behaved after being castrated. He said: ‘Dogs have a unique bond with us humans. 'Our two dogs, Boris and Maggie, have a loyalty, a love, a calming nature through exercise and, of course, the comfort a dog can give you. ‘When your animals need medical attention, you worry about them like you would any other member of the family.' He added: ‘For the first and last time, I can stand in this House and say that Boris's bad behaviour was improved immensely when I had him castrated. ‘He did have a castration operation when he was younger and that night he got constant attention, because they are like a member of your family. 'The public when we go out and buy an animal, we need to expect those animals are getting a healthy start in life, that they are well looked after.’ Some puppies can also pose a risk to their owners in later life due to their mistreatment, Mr Flello added. Irresponsible breeders usually sell the animals privately, on the internet or to retail outlets. But banning the sale of puppies and kittens in pet shops, garden centres and ‘pet supermarkets’ is the easiest way to have an immediate impact on the problem, Mr Flello said. He said local councils may already have the power to restrict pet shop licences to stop them selling certain types of animals, and if so they should stop the sale of puppies and kittens. Opening a debate on a backbench business motion in the Commons, Mr Flello said: ‘We consider ourselves to be a nation of animal lovers where a dog is a man's best friend, a pet cat, a pet dog is part of the family. ‘But every day puppies and kittens are bought from pet shops or garden centres that become ill. All too frequently they die as a result of the supply chain from irresponsible breeder to pet shop. ‘Quite frankly I can't think a nation of animal lovers would allow this to continue. ‘Are we at risk of becoming a nation with disposable pets?’ Mr Flello said the sale of puppies and kittens on the high street can lead to impulse-buying, leaving owners with the burden of unhealthy animals that may have behavioural problems, which can lead to pets being abandoned. He said: ‘Puppies and kittens are housed and sold without their mothers and the presence of such retail outlets encourages impulsive buying, irresponsible breeding, and commoditisation of these animals, as well as too often leaving prospective owners with the burden of life-threatening health and behavioural problems associated with pet shop puppies. ‘The Government can therefore have an immediate effect without any excessive enforcement costs by banning the sale of puppies and kittens on high street premises.’ Mr Flello acknowledged that improving public information to encourage people to only buy puppies and kittens when their mother is present is important, but the banning of their sale on the high street is needed to combat impulse-buying. Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke revealed he had two dogs - one called 'Boris' and the other 'Maggie' He said: ‘Information is absolutely important but, with all the best information in the world, if you happen to be buying a container of goldfish food from the local pet shop with your family and they see a cute puppy or a cute kitten that's where a problem arises - the impulse purchase.’ The MP added: ‘My intention from this motion is not to vilify pet shops per se but in almost every case where they sell puppies and kittens they simply can't meet the specific needs required in this developmental golden period for puppies to learn their future emotional template, in order to exhibit normal behaviour patterns, to safely adjust to family life, as well as all the health implications.’ Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee chair Anne McIntosh said self-regulation and better public information was the way forward. She said: ‘I'm slightly confused as to why a great deal of emphasis in your speech was on pet shops because my understanding is that pet shops are the one part of the trade that is pretty much regulated.’ She went on: ‘The message that I think should go forward from the House today is that there is a role for self-regulation. ‘Surely to any responsible potential dog or cat owner we should not be buying puppies or kittens where the mother is not present. ‘That is so self evident. Do we need to legislate that? Is that something we just need to go out and educate the public on?’","Labour's Robert Flello said the Government needed to tackle 'puppy farms'

"By . Marcus Townend for the Daily Mail . Frankie Dettori could still ride for boss Sheik Joaan Al Thani in next month’s Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe but it will need circumstances to fall into place. The shock news that the 43-year-old had been replaced on favourite and 2013 winner Treve by veteran Thierry Jarnet at the request of trainer Criquette Head-Maarek emerged on Monday. Dettori’s hopes of winning a fourth Arc and a first for his Qatari boss now could lie with Aidan O’Brien’s 2013 Derby winner Ruler of the World and Elie Lellouche’s Ectot but neither are his automatic rides. Blow: Frankie Dettori lost the mount of Treve ahead of Group One Prix Vermeille at Longchamp on Sunday . Ruler Of The World was bought into on the understanding that Joseph O’Brien, son of trainer Aidan O’Brien, would keep the ride, while Ectot will remain the mount of his regular French rider Gregory Benoit for the remainder of the season should he want it. But there is hope for Dettori. O’Brien would undoubtedly choose Australia should the dual Derby winner, who faces 12 rivals in Saturday’s Irish Champion Stakes, make it to the Arc. While Benoit has a very attractive Arc alternative in unbeaten French Oaks winner Avenir Certain. Success: Frankie Dettori celebrates winning The Prix Vermeille riding Treve at Longchamp last September . Benoit rides Ectot in Sunday’s Prix Niel at Longchamp but, with O’Brien on duty in Ireland, significantly, Dettori, will now ride Ruler Of The World in the Prix Foy. He had been expected at the Curragh to partner Richard Hannon’s Osaila in the Moyglare Stud Stakes . The switch seems designed to demonstrate the Sheik’s backing for Dettori, whose position as his first jockey has been seriously undermined. On an Arc ride for Dettori, Harry Herbert, racing manager to Sheik Joaan, said: ‘There are lots of balls in the air.’ Dettori’s mood will not have lifted by the disappointing defeat of the Sheik’s record £5.25million filly Al Naamah in the Prix d’Amaule at Chantilly, especially as her 25-1 pacemaker Shahah won.

A hole-in-one is reward enough for every golfer on the planet, but the prize being offered for an ace at the KLM Open this week is simply out of this world. The first player to get down in just one stroke on the 163-yard 15th hole at the Kennemer Golf & Country Club will quite rightly feel over the moon - because they will bag themselves a trip into space. It is the first time such a prize has been offered at a golf tournament. A life-size model of the spacecraft (a Lynx Mark I) that will take the winner into orbit will be displayed next to the 15th green throughout the tournament. Cosmic: Michiel Mol of XCOR Space Expeditions and Daan Slooter, tournament director of the KLM Open, stand next to the model of the Lynx Mark I spacecraft by the 15th hole at Kennemer Golf & Country Club in Holland . 'With this prize we wish to create awareness among the public that space is now also accessible for everyone,' said Michiel Mol from XCOR Space Expeditions, who have offered the prize worth around £100,000. 'Journeys into space can be made starting from the end of 2015. We already have 300 bookings.' Among those hoping to win the prize this week in Zandvoort, which is just outside Amsterdam, include former Open champions Darren Clarke and Padraig Harrington, England's Paul Casey, home favourite Joost Luiten, and Miguel Angel Jimenez. Blast off: Former Open champion Darren Clarke is among those competing for the prize this week . But whether the colourful Spaniard could stomach tubed space food rather than his beloved rioja wine is doubtful. The KLM Open winner may not quite join that illustrious list of stars in the golfing firmament - but the first man to shoot a hole-in-one will be blasting off, rather than teeing off, sometime in the near future.","Golfers at the KLM Open this week have chance to win unique prize .

"By . Nick Mashiter, Press Association . Head coach Alan Irvine has backed Saido Berahino to become West Brom's main man after recapturing his spark. The striker will lead the Baggies line again against Everton on Saturday as Irvine hunts his first league win. He scored twice in England Under-21s' 3-0 win over Moldova on Monday and has four goals for club and country this season. Saido Berahino scored in England Under-21s' victory over Moldova on Monday night and Alan Irvine (right) believes he can take that form to lead West Brom in the Premier League . Berahino is the only player to score for Albion in the Barclays Premier League this season, a double in their opening-day 2-2 draw with Sunderland. They have drawn a blank at Southampton and in a wretched 3-0 defeat at Swansea, with new £10million man Brown Ideye yet to settle and Georgios Samaras lacking match fitness. But Irvine believes Berahino, who scored just three times after Boxing Day last season, can shoulder the goalscoring burden. He said: 'I certainly think he can be that frontman. He finishes well with either foot and he is one of the players we have got in mind to be one of our strikers. 'He has come in as a young player to a team where, people keep telling me, there were problems last year but all I have seen is a very mature lad who is a good professional. 'I have been delighted with him and I'm excited about the future. He can be a top player.' Saido Berahino scored Albion's second goal at Old Trafford last season in the Baggies' away win against Manchester United . New signing Sebastian Blanco has struggled with a lack of fitness since his move to The Hawthorns . Berahino, 21, is yet to play as a central striker with Irvine using him out wide due to Sebastian Blanco and Silvestre Varela's lack of fitness. The summer signings could make their debuts this weekend and Irvine is relishing the chance to let Berahino loose in his favoured position. 'I think his best position is through the middle, he has got good movement and receives the ball well,' said Irvine, who spent over eight years at Everton as assistant manager and head of youth. 'He understands, when we don't have the ball, where he should be and he has a real desire to work and continue to learn. 'The shame is we have had to play him a bit wider because we haven't had alternatives. That's something we're getting closer to having and hopefully means we can play our players in the places they want to be. 'Full credit to the lads. They have played where they have been asked to and done it to the best of their ability.'","Berahino scored twice for England Under-21s on Monday .

"By . Marcus Townend For Mail Online . Sir Michael Stoute will launch a two-horse assault on Saturday’s £650,000 Ladbrokes St Leger after it was confirmed that Kings Fete will join Snow Sky at Doncaster on Saturday. Both horses are owned by Khaled Abdullah, whose No 1 jockey James Doyle is poised to ride Stoute’s seeming first string, Gordon Stakes winner and Great Voltigeur Stakes runner-up Snow Sky, the 5-1 second favourite. Abdullah’s racing manager Lord Grimthorpe said he hoped Ryan Moore would ride whichever mount Doyle rejected. The three-time champion rode Kings Fete in his work at the weekend . Second favourite: Khaled Abdullah-owned 5-1 St Leger chance Snow Sky will be ridden by James Doyle . Kings Fete, a 16-1 shot, had looked an unlikely Leger runner, his refusal to settle in his races leading to a failure to deliver on his potential for Stoute, who the Leger with Conduit in 2008. But Grimthorpe said: ‘Kings Fete worked himself onto the team on Saturday morning. Sir Michael is keen for him to take his chance. ‘He has to mature and settle a bit better but Sir Michael has always had a very high opinion of him. He feels he is a work in progress.’ Fifteen have been left in the final Classic, headed by Roger Varian’s Derby runner-up Kingston Hill, the 5-2 favourite. Varian’s fears that the ground will get too firm for his colt have been eased by the 14mm rain which fell at the track over the weekend. Outsider: Kings Fete (left), is a roughie at 16-1 for the £650,000 race at Doncaster but gets his chance . Doncaster officials are now predicting the going on race day should be no quicker than Good. Newmarket trainer John Gosden, who has won the race four times, runs Derby third Romsdal, Forever Now and Marzocco as he chases a win that will go a long way to securing a second trainers’ championship.

"By . Press Association Reporter . Sir Bradley Wiggins believes his Tour of Britain title defence is all but over after Michal Kwiatkowski seized the race lead by stealing a stunning stage-four victory in Bristol. Poland's Kwiatkowski (Omega Pharma-QuickStep) won the sprint for the line at the end of the 184.6-kilometre route from Worcester to claim a time bonus and take the yellow jersey by three seconds from Edoardo Zardini (Bardiani CSF). Wiggins (Team Sky), the 2012 Tour de France champion and 2013 Tour of Britain winner, is now sixth, 27 seconds adrift. Sir Bradley Wiggins in the peloton as stage four  of The Tour Of Britain Cycle Race passes through Evesham . Sir Bradley Wiggins looks on prior to the start of Tour Of Britain stage from Worcester to Bristol . The Briton, who could claw back time in Sunday morning's short time-trial, said on ITV.com: 'I'm still up there but on paper first place has gone now. 'I can't see myself getting 27 seconds on Kwiatkowski, but the podium is only 12 seconds away. 'He only has to have a puncture in the time trial. I wouldn't say the GC (general classification) is over because finishing up there as the defending champion is important.' Alex Dowsett (Movistar) was in the day's six-man break, but a double puncture saw him fall back to the peloton. The real action came inside the final 3km when Albert Timmer (Giant-Shimano), who had been in the day's break alongside Dowsett, tried to accelerate up Bridge Valley Road following the peloton's passage through the Avon Gorge. Michal Kwiatkowski celebrates after winning stage four of the Tour of Britian . First Jack Bauer (Garmin-Sharp) bridged the gap to Timmer and it appeared the two would contend for the stage win, but then Kwiatkowski and three others accelerated towards them. The Pole had enough energy to power past Bauer and Timmer to take victory, much to the latter's frustration. Belgium's Dylan Teuns (BMC Racing) was third and Bauer fourth. Kwiatkowski is a talented all-rounder and is now favourite for overall victory in London on Sunday, although plenty of hurdles remain, beginning with Thursday's fifth stage in Devon. Wiggins finished in the bunch behind Team Sky colleague Ben Swift, who was six seconds behind Kwiatkowski in seventh.

"By . James Nye for MailOnline . A cyclist has died after a police car struck him and backed-up over him say witnesses - before an officer exited the vehicle and placed him under arrest while he was 'spitting blood'. According to those who saw the incident on Wednesday afternoon in Quebec City, Guy Blouin, 48, was intercepted by the police cruiser going the wrong way up a one way street. The car allegedly hit Blouin, knocking him under the car and Quebec City police department issued a statement on Thursday morning to say they are fully cooperating with the investigation. Packed away: According to witnesses the officers put the cyclist's bike in their trunk after the accident, only to replace it later . 'They ran over the guy, the guy ended up under the car. For an entire 15 seconds; he was under the tire in a fetal position,' Alexandre Beaulieu told CBC News. Beaulieu told reporters that after the initial collision he saw an officer exit his car, see Blouin was under the wheels, get back into the car and roll over the 48-year-old a second time. Another witness confirmed this. This witness, who said his name was Daniel, also claimed he heard police arrest the man on the floor, while 'he was spitting blood'. Shocking: According to witnesses the cyclist was stuck under the wheels of the police car and seriously wounded .

"By . Cindy Tran for Daily Mail Australia . It's been 22 years since she worked with America's legendary musician Jeff Buckley, but photographer Merri Cyr says she's still amazed by the incredible legacy that the music legend has left behind worldwide. With the 20th Anniversary of Buckley's hit album Grace approaching, the American photographer is currently displaying her exclusive collection of one of the world's most mysterious musical legends in Australia. The 50-year-old said she reminisces about the years she spent working with the promising artist at his Florida recording studio near Miami Beach and shooting him on his roof top in New York City in 1992. Merri Cyr said her friendship with Jeff Buckley started from a work project and later was personally selected by the musician himself to shoot his album cover Grace . Ms Cyr said her friendship with Buckley started from a work project, then she was personally selected by the musician himself to shoot his album cover and document his life on and off stage during his tour. ‘I met Jeff during an assignment I had to shoot for Paper Magazine – a style magazine in New York City,’ she told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I photographed him a lot and all my photographs reminded me of the moments we worked and spent together or shooting around his home – it was a bookmark of all the time I spent and worked with him. ‘He was definitely not camera shy and I guess being a performer, he loved being in front of the cameras a lot and was very seductive'. When asked whether she had a favourite photo of Buckley, she said it was too hard to chose. ‘I can’t choose a favourite because I’m attached to the experience I had with him and when I look at the photographs, it brings back memories of what we did on that exact day – like what we did, where we had lunch and things like that.’ Merri Cyr said the photograph she shot of Jeff eating the banana, taken in New York City 1993, reminded her a lot like Leonard Cohen's 'I'm your man' single cover . The charismatic singer, songwriter and guitarist died in May 1997 after he drowned in a river in Memphis, Tennessee, United States at the age of 30. ‘I’m amazed by his popularity from around the world since his death. People really embrace Jeff as a musician. He travelled to Australia a lot as part of his career and it’s great to see so many fans interested and the popularity growth,' she said. ‘It was interesting to see him work on his studio album, Grace because I had never heard him perform prior to his photo shoots. I wanted to watch him play as well as taking photographs around the studio. ‘He was quite hands on and knew what he wanted from the sounds. You can definitely see his passion and he wrote all his music in a very pacific way. 'Music was everything to Jeff – every aspect of creating music or supporting music – he was a perfectionist.' Buckley on the couch listening to a mix of his song Eternal Life on December 3, 1994 at a recording studio in Miami . One of the most memorable pictures Ms Cyr took is the photograph of Jeff eating the banana, because it reminded her a lot of Leonard Cohen's 'I'm your man' single cover. ‘He was just hungry and started eating a banana when we were in the middle of shooting his cover album Grace. 'I think in a weird way, the photo visually reminded me of Leonard Cohen’s single cover where he is also seen eating a banana. I don't think Jeff did it intentionally but that's just what I think. ‘He was very excited by the photographs I took of him and we subsequently scheduled to shoot more often after that. It was very collaborative – an equal participant and something we did something together. Buckley was photographed under a chandelier in the bathroom during the Grace album cover shoot, Williamsburg, Brooklyn at Arcadia studios in 1993 . 20 years of Grace: A special Jeff Buckley exhibition by Merri Cyr is currently on at the Blender Gallery in Sydney until September 20. The gallery will feature 25 of Cyr's images of Buckley with some of the photographs never before printed or exhibited. A Blender Gallery spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia that the 'Jeff Buckley with the banana' photograph is among one of the 'never before seen shots'. ‘I’m really excited to share my experiences and photographs at the exhibition for the 20th anniversary for my friend, Jeff,’ she said.

"By . Pete Jenson . Follow @@petejenson . Barcelona are expected to announce that club legend Xavi Hernandez will finally be leaving them after 23 years service. The club captain has negotiated a settlement on the two years left on his contract leaving the way clear for him to join Manchester City’s MLS franchise New York City. The club captain who turned up at the Camp Nou as a hopeful 11-year-old and went on to play a record 723 matches for them, winning 22 trophies leaves the club after 16 seasons with the first team. Heading to America: Barcelona midfielder Xavi could join Frank Lampard at New York City FC . Barca fans have feared the confirmation of Xavi’s departure for weeks and with this Thursday set as the date for his return to training finally confirmation is imminent. Although Manchester City’s new MLS side New York City looks like being his new destination that will still give him a year to fill ahead of their big kick-off in 2015. The confirmation of his departure, expected from the club on Tuesday, means that when Barcelona jet into England on Monday to spend a week at the FA’s St. George’s Park they will do so without one of the most important players in their history – the player who led them to three of their four European Cup triumphs. Xavi is expected to take part in a benefit game for Deco who retired last year on Friday. He will line up along side Ronaldinho, Samuel Eto'o and Leo Messi in a match between the Porto side that won the Champions Leage under Jose Mourinho in 2004 and the Barcelona side that won it in 2006 in Portugal on Friday.

His agent and brother, Roberto de Assis, revealed that the 34-year-old has no plans to retire and will host a press conference tomorrow with Atletico Mineiro's president, Alexandre Kalil. De Assis said: 'He will play until he's 42. He will reveal his future destination on Wednesday.' Boca Juniors have been suggested as his most likely destination.

"By . Callum Wilson . Those at Old Trafford may not have got the memo, but the defence proved high on the must-fix agenda of Premier League clubs during the summer. Manchester United's defensive unrest was eased by the late arrival of Daley Blind, but Louis van Gaal preferred to invest in firepower up front and he will hope that will compensate for his back problems. Sixty defenders were bought by Premier League sides, compared with 30 strikers and here, Sportsmail dissect the comings and goings in each and every position... VIDEO Scroll down to watch Premier League breaks records across the board . GOALKEEPERS . The goalkeeper that dominated the headlines was Chelsea's Thibaut Courtois, who returned from three years away and must feel like a new signing, fresh from winning Atletico Madrid's first La Liga title in 18 years. Now he's back, the 6ft 6in Belgian has usurped Petr Cech as No 1 at Stamford Bridge, the first keeper to do so in 10 years. The most expensive purchase was made by Southampton who, for a cool £10million, lured Fraser Forster from Celtic. Manchester United's summer transfer activity got going with 17-year-old Serbia Under 19 keeper Vanja Milinkovic, too, although he is on loan at Serbian club Vojvodina.

Luke Shaw made headlines for the right and wrong reasons during the summer transfer window. Firstly, for his £31.5m switch from Southampton to Manchester United. Secondly, for having his fitness publicly criticised by new manager Van Gaal. Manchester City's Eliaquim Managala, at £32m, cost half a million more than his English counterpart. It is Arsenal's Calum Chambers, though, who seems a bargain so far for £10m from Southampton.

The theme in midfield seemed to be players winding up at unexpected clubs. Cesc Fabregas's return to England saw the man that made 212 Premier League appearances for Arsenal join London rivals Chelsea for £30m. But those at Stamford Bridge may never get used to seeing Frank Lampard don a different shade of blue with Manchester City - the 36-year-old's six-month loan from New York City still sinking in. And Alex Song's season-long loan with West Ham wasn't the most expected switch. Theme: Cesc Fabregas's return to England saw the former Arsenal star join Chelsea from Barcelona .

Angel di Maria left Real Madrid and joined Manchester United for a staggering £60m, which broke the British transfer record for the most-expensive signing in history. Quite the statement by Van Gaal. Likewise, Arsenal wanted to bolster their attack and did so with Barcelona's Alexis Sanchez for £30m. Hatem Ben Arfa, with the deadline looming, was calling for help all the way from Newcastle and Hull obliged. Steve Bruce threw the attacker a lifeline with a season-long loan and the 27-year-old couldn't stop smiling.

It's still early days but Diego Costa has seemingly brought Chelsea's striker curse to an end after signing for £32m, with four goals in three matches. Radamel Falcao's £6m season-long loan to Manchester United was as unexpected as it was impressive, and the former Monaco centre forward will soon get his first taste of Premier League action. Arsenal secured the signature of United's Danny Welbeck for £16m in the early hours of Tuesday morning with the transfer window left slightly ajar. More? West Brom broke their transfer record for £10m-signing Brown Ideye, Everton did the same with £28m-priced Romelu Lukaku, as did Hull with their £10m punt on Abel Hernandez.

"By . Nick Mashiter, Press Association . Joleon Lescott will be given a chance to prove his West Brom fitness as he eyes a Baggies debut against Everton. The defender is yet to feature in the Barclays Premier League for Albion after suffering a knee injury in pre-season but is in line to play against Hull in an under-21 friendly on Tuesday. Lescott, who moved on a free after leaving Manchester City in the summer, could be joined by fellow new boys Cristian Gamboa, Silvestre Varela and Sebastian Blanco who all lack fitness.

A return would be a huge boost ahead of the Baggies' home game with Everton on Saturday after centre-back Gareth McAuley limped out of Northern Ireland's 2-1 win in Hungary on Sunday. 'We've got an under-21 friendly here on Tuesday and I would love to be able to play players in that game who need to play. Ideally I would want to be including all of them,' head coach Alan Irvine told the club's official site. Not wanted:England defender was deemed surplus to requirements at Manchester City . Great Scott! James Morrison could also feature in the closed game against Hull after playing for Scotland . 'It is scheduled as an under-21 friendly but I think with Hull's five signings on deadline day and us trying to get players bedded in, I would think it will end up being a game for a whole load of players that Steve (Bruce, Hull manager) doesn't know very well and I don't know very well. 'It's fairly star-studded but they need it, several have not done a pre-season. There's a lot of players who need training and games and also get to need to get to know one other.' Georgios Samaras may also play after he lasted 45 minutes of Greece's 1-0 Euro 2016 qualifier defeat to Romania on Sunday and James Morrison, who played in Scotland's 2-1 loss to Germany as he continued his recovery from a knee injury, is pencilled in.","Joleon Lescott in line to make his West Brom debut against Everton .

"By . Kieran Gill for MailOnline . Follow @@kie1410 . Lewis Baker led England U20 to a 6-0 mauling of Romania U19 on Friday, and the Chelsea midfielder proudly donned the captain's armband throughout for the first time in his still-young career. But who is the man that won Young Player of the Year  last season as a Chelsea youngster? Here, Sportsmail examines the the 19-year-old and tell you all you need to know. Potential: Lewis Baker led England U20 to a 6-0 mauling of Romania U19 on Friday in his debut at that level . BORN: Luton, April 25 1995 (age 19) POSITION: Central midfielder . YOUTH CAREER: . 2004-2005: Luton . 2005-2014: Chelsea . SENIOR CAREER: . 2014-NOW: Chelsea . 2011-2011: England U17 (7, 1) 2013-2014: England U19 (14, 9) 2014-NOW: England U20 (1, 1) Who is this potential England star? Baker is a 19-year-old central midfielder who, having plied his trade at Luton in their centre of excellence, joined Chelsea in 2005. Scouts were quick to sign the then-10-year-old from the Luton academy, despite Arsenal, Aston Villa and Queens Park Rangers also lurking. It took more than just his party trick - being able to do 600 keepie-uppies in one go - to catch their attention, though. His ability in the engine room, even at the tender age of nine, impressed Chelsea enough to fork out a four-figure sum more than 10 years ago. They've kept tight hold ever since, seeing off interest from Middesbrough, Bolton Wanderers, Watford and other Championship clubs, who want to take him away from Stamford Bridge on loan. But no Chelsea youngsters get through to the first team... Ah, but they do. Jose Mourinho gifted Baker his senior debut in the FA Cup against Derby in January. The England hopeful came on as a late substitute for Oscar, leaving Juan Mata and Co on the bench at Pride Park, and Chelsea comfortably won 2-0. It isn't all about the first team, though. Baker's U21 duties at Chelsea involve him acting as captain for others developing at the London club. Baker, on his debut at U20 level, captained England and scored a penalty en route to a 6-0 win on Friday. With little else to do during the international break, Mourinho should take note. Strike: Baker scores a penalty against Romania on Friday as he led from the front like a true captain . Star in the making: Baker is a 19-year-old central midfielder who plied his trade at Luton's centre of excellence . Celebration: Chelsea enough to fork out a four-figure sum more than 10 years ago to snap up Baker . Join MailOnline's Fantasy Football game by clicking here and start picking now! What would I have to pay to buy him? A pretty penny, as is the norm in football nowadays. Baker's price would likely be north of £5million, should you wish to bring him to your club. Middlesbrough, Bolton and Watford enquired about the starlet's status, but were unsuccessful in agreeing a loan deal with Chelsea. Untested talent can be difficult to slap a price on, of course, but Chelsea insist they have no ordinary youth product on their hands here. What's his style of play? Frank Lampard-esque. Baker sits in the middle, overseeing almost every pocket of space the pitch has to offer. He can, though, switch to the right wing and play behind the striker if need be. The playmaker's ability to take a free-kick with either foot leaves goalkeepers at a loss. His left-footed strike against Tottenham and his right-footed goal against Juventus are testament to his versatility. Proud: Baker tweeted his pleasing message about being the captain for England at the U20 level . CLICK HERE to read the match report from England U20's 6-0 win over Romania U19 . But is there a chance he'll be a regular first team player? That's the £5m (or so) question. Willian, Cesc Fabregas, Eden Hazard, Ramires, Andre Schurrle and more are all midfielders above Baker in the pecking order. He has his work cut out for him. A loan spell would most likely be best for Baker to whet his appetite in the Championship or higher, but that's a point Mourinho is distinctly against. The Chelsea manager prefers to track Baker's progress himself in the development squad. ‘At 16 or 17 I don’t think it’s good for them to go somewhere else to play, like in the Championship,' said Mourinho. 'At 17 they have to train with us and they have to learn with us. They will learn a lot.' Happy, Lewis? Chelsea saw off interest from Middesbrough and Co, who want to take the midfielder on loan . Chance? Baker will try to break into the first team again but must beat a host of talented names to do so . Sticking around: Chelsea want to track Baker's progress in their development squad for the time being .","Lewis Baker made Chelsea senior debut in FA Cup in January against Derby .

"By . Paul Newman for the Daily Mail . Follow @@Paul_NewmanDM . Glory be, England not only won a one-day match against India at Headingley on Friday but did so with a flair that had appeared beyond them after three thumping 50-over defeats. The series may have been lost but this was anything but a dead rubber for Alastair Cook and an England side who desperately needed a victory. England have not suddenly turned into World Cup contenders but their 41-run win in the final one-day international was proof, perhaps, that their methods can work in modern one-day cricket. Majestic: Joe Root inspired England to victory with a magnificent knock of 113 against India at Headingley . On song: Root scored at a quick pace and helped England set a competitive total at Headingley on Friday . Respite: England captain Alastair Cook has come under pressure to resign but managed to record a win . Quick-fire: England batsman Joe Root scored a rapid 49 to help England post a score of 294-7 at Headingley . Impressive: England's Ben Stokes (second right) took three wickets to help bowl India out at Headingley . Resistance: Ravindra Jadeja added runs to India's total at the end but he quickly ran out of batting partners . Cook said: ‘It’s frustrating. If we play like that we’ll win a lot more games. We haven’t had the wrong tactics, we’ve had guys not doing their jobs very well in the last three games. They did them well today. ‘The bottom line is we’ve lost another series and there are more questions than answers but I’d rather win the World Cup than this series. We’ve got a great opportunity to work at our one-day game and the improvement we can make is scary. That’s what we’ve got to get our heads round now.’ India’s attitude could be summed up by the sight of them taking delivery of a McDonald’s takeaway during Thusday’s practice session. Whether England were dining on quinoa and mung beans instead is unclear but they certainly looked fitter and, yes, more dynamic yesterday. Cook was timing the ball better than at almost any other time this summer on a cracking Headingley pitch. He lost Alex Hales, and Moeen Ali, promoted to three on the back of his display at Edgbaston but caught at third man here. It was when Joe Root joined Cook that England really began to produce the one-day batting needed to take the attack to India. Cook, leading England in a record 63rd one-day international, failed to make the most of another good start and when Eoin Morgan struggled it appeared that spin would again undo England. Morgan’s form remains one of England’s biggest worries moving towards the World Cup and it was almost a relief when he was out. Root was in sensational Test form all summer and it now looks as though he would take over the one-day captaincy should the selectors decide that a new leader is needed before February’s World Cup. Frustration: India captain MS Dhoni trudges off the field after losing his wicket at Headingley on Friday . All smiles: Steven Finn (right) bowled well as England kept the pressure on India and took wickets regularly . Half-century: Ambati Rayudu (right) scored 53 to try and push India to victory but they lost wickets regularly . Together: England captain Alastair Cook (centre) gives a team talk during the ODI match at Headingley . The odds favour Cook staying but Root is emerging as the captain-elect in all forms of the game. He again looked a class act here in leading England to a competitive total. Jos Buttler is another who has not been at his best in this series but he was the catalyst for England’s eventual riches of 294 for seven by loosening India’s spin stranglehold. As Root and Buttler attacked, India’s bowlers started to lose their immaculate line and length and the runs flowed. The pair added 107 for the fifth wicket in 14 overs before Buttler sloppily ran himself out. Luckily, Ben Stokes — in chronic international batting form almost ever since his breakthrough hundred in Perth — also threw off the shackles to support Root. Yorkshireman Root went to his second one-day international century with the second of three sixes but did not see the job through. He handed Mohammed Shami the first of his two wickets before Stokes took the initiative with an unbeaten 33 off 23 balls with two sixes of his own. It left India with a chase well within their compass but once Jimmy Anderson removed Ajinkya Rahane with the third ball of the innings to take his first wicket of the series they always looked like coming off second best. While MS Dhoni was there India had hope but when he toe-ended a wide delivery from Steven Finn to cover the game was up, even though Ravindra Jadeja’s 87 made sure India went down with all guns blazing. The series was lost 3-1 but it is a start for England. Meanwhile, Tim Bresnan has been ruled out of England’s Twenty20 match against India at Edgbaston on Sundaywith a shoulder injury.","Joe Root scored magnificent 113 to give England total of 294-7 .

"By . Pa Reporter . Kevin Pietersen has labelled Alastair Cook as 'selfish' for not talking up England's chances of winning the World Cup. The former England batsman used his Daily Telegraph column to add his voice to the growing number of former players questioning Cook's leadership of the one-day side. England may have beaten India by 41 runs on Friday to avoid a series whitewash, but Pietersen is still frustrated by what he sees as a negative attitude in the one-day set up. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cook's  defiant stand over captaincy . Outspoken: Kevin Pietersen has called Alastair Cook 'selfish' for not talking up England's World Cup chances . 'I think it is selfish that the captain is not talking positively about winning the World Cup,' he said. 'In Alastair Cook's own words it is 'far fetched' to believe we can win the tournament. I just do not buy that. It is also nonsense to think we do not have time to make changes that could transform England's chances.' Pietersen revealed that the lack of positivity going into next year's tournament is especially galling after the Ashes schedule was amended to improve England's chances. 'There is a theory the England and Wales Cricket Board are reluctant to remove Cook as captain of the one-day team because it might destabilise the camp ahead of next year's Ashes,' he added. 'That is hard to swallow for those of us who endured back-to-back Ashes campaigns just so this winter could be dedicated to one-day cricket in the lead-up to the World Cup.' Too little too late: England averted a whitewash by beating India in their final one-day match at Headingley . Although Cook came through similar doubts about his suitability to lead the Test side earlier this summer, Pietersen believes his style fundamentally does not fit in with what is required in the shorter form of the game. The 34-year-old, who also suggested English stars should spend time in the IPL to hone their limited overs skills, has joined Graeme Swann and Michael Vaughan in suggesting he should just focus on the Tests. He said: 'This is not a witch-hunt against Cook. But he would gain a lot of respect if he admitted he is not the right man to open the batting and captain the one-day team, and decided he was going to concentrate all his efforts on winning back the Ashes.' Pick and choose: Graeme Swann is one of several players to suggest that Cook concentrates on Test cricket .","Alastair Campbell has talked down England's hopes of winning World Cup .

"By . David Clough, Press Association . Alastair Cook’s England at last delivered the victory they needed so badly against India - but he is still awaiting an assurance that he will remain captain through their World Cup winter. Joe Root’s career-best 113 came to Cook’s aid, underpinning a total of 294 for seven which England safely defended thanks principally to early wickets and economy from James Anderson - and despite half-centuries from the world champions’ Ravindra Jadeja (87) and Ambati Rayudu (53). The eventual margin of 41 runs did not flatter the hosts, who were significantly the better team throughout at Headingley - if not so overwhelmingly as India have been elsewhere on their way to their 3-1 Royal London Series victory. Doubt: Alastair Cook does not know if he'll be captain when England travel to Sri Lanka . Captain Cook: England's skipper scored 46 as England cruised to victory on Friday at Headingley . Leader: Cook gives a team-talk during the Royal London one-day match against India . Cook therefore concludes his eventful, and often stressful, summer by avoiding a whitewash with a consolation win. Asked if he has been told already, however, that he will definitely stay in charge when the selectors name their squad later this month for seven one-day internationals in Sri Lanka, Cook said: “No, I haven’t.” He can only hope so, but with a little more confidence than he perhaps had on the journey north to Leeds this week after England’s previous trouncing at Edgbaston. “We did (badly need to win),” he added. “It becomes slightly frustrating - because if you play like that, you’ll win a lot more games. “We did a lot of things very well, and a lot of things we know we had to do and haven’t been doing in previous games - like one of those guys, top four or five going on and getting a big score, and then the others can support him.” Root’s methods were an endorsement for the tactics England intend to stick to, especially at home - top-order batsmen backing themselves to play long innings, and accelerating with wicket resources intact. Consolation: England restored some pride by beating India on Friday, but still lost the series 3-1 . Top scorer: Joe Root was England's success story on Friday, scoring a career-high 113 . Many pundits have been loquacious in their criticism, advising more adventure. But Cook said: “In these conditions, two new balls and 10.30 starts at Headingley, it’s going to do a little bit early on - and it’s very naive to think you can just whack it straight away. “There is a certain way you have to play.” As for his continued tenure as captain, he repeated a near season-long mantra which extends back to the pressure he was under too before England turned round the Test series against India. He said: “There hasn’t been a press conference I’ve been in all summer when someone hasn’t mentioned my future as captain ... and I always give the (same) answer - while I still want to do the job and believe I can, then I’ll carry on doing it. “If they don’t want me to, then I’ll take it on the chin.” Cook has good reason to be grateful to Root, whose hundred on his home ground - and century stand with Jos Buttler - gained the day. “Rooty obviously was the difference. You can get two or three guys getting 20, 30s and 40s if someone else goes on and gets a hundred off 100 balls,” he said. “You can speak about it enough, and get told you’ve got the wrong tactics. But it’s not the wrong tactics - it’s just people not doing their job very well. “We haven’t for three games, but we did today.” High: Root (left) celebrates his century against India at Headingley . Trophy: India beat England 3-1 overall in the Royal London one-day series . Root reached a strike rate of 100 plus only deep into his innings. Cook said: “It was a fantastic hundred ... to score a run-a-ball on that wicket. You saw a lot of the other guys struggle to do that. He played beautifully. “If we do that, we’re a tough side to beat. “It’s very easy talking about it - everyone knows about it - but actually doing it is a lot harder.” Cook’s opposite number Mahendra Singh Dhoni found himself in the unaccustomed position of trying to explain an ODI defeat. He said: “Three hundred was par score today, and we gave away quite a few soft wickets in the middle order. Confusion: England's Joss Buttler (right) and Joe Root (left) almost collide during the fifth ODI . “We lost too many wickets and were not in position to chase the runs, so those dismissals really cost us the game.” Dhoni has another chance to finish India’s tour with a win, in Sunday’s NatWest Twenty20 back at Edgbaston. Cook, by contrast, signs off with minor encouragement after series defeats in both Tests and ODIs against Sri Lanka, and a win and a loss against India. “The bottom line is we have lost a series,” he said, before reflecting on a decidedly mixed first season of his and coach Peter Moores’ new era. “I feel tired,” he said. “When we’ve played well, we’ve played really well - and when we’ve played badly, we’ve played pretty badly as well. “It’s always interesting (in this job), and this is just another interesting summer.” Tradition: England captain Cook tosses the coin pre-match, alongside India captain MS Dhoni .

"By . Pa Reporter . Frank Lampard has revealed his fears for England's future as young stars struggle for first team opportunities in the Premier League. The Manchester City midfielder, on loan from New York City, feels that the influx of top European talent is a major driving force behind the stagnation of home-grown talent. Lampard, who retired from England duty with 106 caps after the World Cup, reflected on his progression through the ranks at West Ham and believes it is a lot different for English prospects today. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sterling and Zaha terrorise England U21 defenders in training . Fear: Frank Lamaprd (L) is worried that England youngsters are not given enough first team opportunities . Teenage kicks: Lampard made his West Ham debut at 17, but doesn't think that happens at top sides now . 'I made my West Ham debut at 17 and was a regular a year later. If I was the same age now I wouldn't be anywhere near the Chelsea or Manchester City sides,' he told The Sun. 'Like the other kids I'd have had to go out on loan.' The 36-year-old, who is Chelsea's all-time leading goalscorer after spending 13 years at Stamford Bridge, acknowledged that coaching facilities are better than ever but there comes a time when players just need games. 'If it was my boy I'd think about sending him to Chelsea to have the best coaching from eight to 15 and, if possible, then send him to a club with less resources to try and get him in the first team at 18,' he added. 'Rio Ferdinand and I were fortunate we experienced it at a young age. But the kids these days get lost. 'There's a stagnant patch where we hear of these good players of 15 and 16 and wonder where they are at 21.' End of an era: Lampard and Steven Gerrard retired from international football after the 2014 World Cup . Lampard highlights Josh McEachran as an example of this after he was widely tipped for big things but was then forced out on loan due to the plethora of top quality midfielders at Chelsea. 'He had his moments but I still think he got a bit downbeat about it,' Lampard said. 'From being talked up he was always having to go out on loan - and where do you go from there? if the door's shut, it can stay shut.' However, the seasoned midfielder also thinks young players in this country can often get ahead of themselves to make matters worse. 'Then there's the fact these young lads have to focus and keep their heads when they start to earn very good money,' he said. 'They have to realise they haven't made it just because everyone is talking about them at 18.' Next big thing?

"By . Paul Hirst, Press Association . Gary Cahill knows it will take some time to win back the supporters who have shunned England in the wake of their disappointing World Cup campaign. England fans made their unhappiness clear on Wednesday night when vast numbers of them stayed away from Wembley for the friendly win over Norway. Just 40,181 turned up to watch the Three Lions edge past the Scandinavians 1-0 in the first game since Roy Hodgson's winless World Cup campaign. Lacklustre: Gary Cahill spoke after training on Friday about England's disappointing summer . No-show: A record-low 40,181 supporters turned out on Wednesday night, with the entire top tier empty . Cahill thinks it is way too easy to write off the England team, but he acknowledges there will be no dramatic transformation. Beating Switzerland in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier would be a good start, though. 'If we win it would go towards (getting the fans back on side), but I think it's not going to happen overnight,' the England and Chelsea defender said. 'Everyone should know and not expect that. 'Everyone needs to be patient with the young players that have come in and don't have the experience of players like Wayne Rooney.' In time: Cahill believes that the support will return when the side get back on track . Struggle: England beat Norway 1-0 at Wembley in Wednesday's friendly, but it was far from simple . With 15 senior players missing through injury, Hodgson has had to call upon previously uncapped players like Calum Chambers and Fabian Delph for the two matches. Danny Rose is another uncapped player in the squad while John Stones looks set to make his first competitive start on Monday in Basle. Cahill, who had to wait until he was 25 before he achieved such a landmark, thinks the new crop of players will need time to bed in, especially with the likes of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard having retired after the World Cup. 'It's a very young squad,' said Cahill, who will start in Switzerland despite slight concerns over an ankle injury. 'Stevie and Frank have retired so you're forced to pick the young players. 'For young ones to come in after the disappointment of the summer and to play now and get your debut now is tough. Skipper: Wayne Rooney leads his England team out on Wednesday - his captaincy debut . Newbie: Everton's John Stones is a newcomer in the England side, but is likely to start on Monday night . 'It's hard to come into an England team, never mind when there's so-called doom and gloom out there.' Cahill, who started all three matches, admits he will be forever scarred by England's winless campaign in South America. 'It's not something you are just going to forget,' the centre-back said. 'But it's not something you need to harp on about. 'It's something you need to move forward, to help you try and get back on track.'

"By . Mia De Graaf . An eight-year-old Manchester United supporter says his new kit has been ruined after Adnan Januzaj changed his squad number, and the club are unwilling to help. The young fan saved up birthday money and spent almost £100 on his favourite player's shirt, only for the Belgian midfielder to change his squad number a month later. Afraid that he will now be teased, James Collins is refusing to wear his shirt, and the club's Megastore refused to change the number for him free of charge. Scroll down for video . Waste: James Collins, left, spent £93.20  on a shirt with Januzaj on the back, but he then changed his number . The number was left vacant after Ryan Giggs' retirement at the end of last season. However, the club did not inform supporters of the planned change until Sunday, August 17 - exactly a month after the new home shirt had been released. Januzaj has played under number 44 for three years after joining the club as a 16-year-old. His young fan James has now refused to wear the Nike strip, which cost him £93.20 in total, fearing he may be teased about it. And despite pleas from his mother Cheryl, the club's Megastore have told him can't have a new shirt, as any printing is done at the shirt owner's risk. Mrs Collins, 45, has now hit out at the club saying they have let the boy down. The mother-of-three, who lives in Longsight, Greater Manchester, said: 'He's United mad. He has spent all summer at football camp and it's all he ever talks about. Dream dashed: James had spent months waiting to get his hands on the new kit but he says it is now 'ruined' 'He couldn't wait to get the new shirt and kept asking when I was ordering it. 'He'd only worn it two or three times when we found out he [Januzaj] had changed number. 'We emailed and asked them if he could change it and they said no because there was a disclaimer with all printing. 'A few weeks ago the club replaced a shirt where someone had spelt Rooney wrong. That was their error. 'Yet we have done nothing wrong and have been left out of pocket. If we had any idea it was going to change I would have made him wait rather than see him disappointed.' Last-minute change: Januzaj joined the club at 16 in 2011 and played under the number 44 until this summer . A short-sleeved home shirt from the Manchester United Megastore costs £42. But additional lettering costs £9.95. Mrs Collins also bought shorts, priced at £20, with an additional cost of £6 to print the number 44. And socks, which cost £12. She says the system needs to change as James is 'devastated'. 'James wanted the third kit as well but I've put a stop to that now. I'm not going to let him spend money on a shirt that could be out of date straight away.' However, a spokesman for the club insisted that notices were prominently displayed throughout the store making clear that squad numbers were not final until they are registered with the Premier League.","James Collins, 8, spent £93.20 saved from birthday money on new kit .

He’s getting a game regularly for Man United.

This 50-second video, filmed on board a flight to Ibiza, shows passengers singing the theme to the Dambusters while doing the actions of a plane as the flight descends. Once the plane lands, cheering erupts and the crowd begins chanting 'here we, here we, here we f*****g go' as they roll down the runway. The crowds on board the Ryanair flight to Ibiza started chanting as the plane came in to land . Other passengers in the background on the flight from Prestwick Airport look anxious and agitated at what is happening just rows in front of them. Cabin crew can also be seen looking on helplessly as the singing goes on uninterrupted. The rowdy flight flew on a Saturday afternoon last month but film of the obscene shouting has only just emerged. Passengers began filming the rowdy holidaymakers as they sang 'here we, here we, here we f*****g go' A passenger, who refused to be named, said: 'This comes as no surprise to see this kind of footage appear. 'This Saturday flight is notorious between passengers and cabin crew alike. 'I was flying back from Majorca with Ryanair last month and got talking to the air stewardess. The 50-second video shows passengers singing the theme to the Dambusters while doing the actions of a plane as the flight descends . 'I asked if she enjoyed her work and she said yes but then admitted she was dreading her shift on Saturday afternoon which was a flight to Ibiza from Prestwick. 'It is well known that these flights are a nightmare with all sorts of stories about outrageous behaviour taking place on them, including planking over seats as the plane comes into land. 'There can't be anybody in the industry who enjoys working them.' Tom Lucas, a sports psychologist who has worked with high-profile stars from Celtic and other football clubs, called for Ryanair to take action against unruly passengers. Mr Lucas, of Glasgow, complained to the airline last year after a fight broke out on his flight to Ibiza and one drunken passenger wet himself in his seat. While some holidaymakers join in with the singing, other look on helplessly or try to ignore the noise . He said: 'Ryanair have rules and regulations but rarely seem to enforce them . 'They will only do something about this when something really serious has happened. 'The staff sometimes make the situation worse by selling drink to people who are already out of it. Our flight ran out of drink, a man wet himself and a fight broke out. 'What kind of way is that to behave on an aeroplane? It's a disgrace and something should be done about it.' A Ryanair spokeswoman said: 'We regret the unruly behaviour of this small group of customers over a brief period as this aircraft was on approach to Ibiza last month. 'However, our cabin supervisor spoke to the group shortly after landing and they apologised and assured her that it would not be repeated. This group has since returned to Glasgow Prestwick without incident.' The rowdy flight actually landed in Ibiza last Saturday, but footage has only just been posted online . Last September a plane was forced to make an emergency landing after a group of drunken Scots sparked chaos on a Ryanair flight from Prestwick Airport to Ibiza. Police said 14 men had been thrown off the plane at Beauvais airport north of Paris and questioned by authorities. French police claimed the group were so inebriated they thought they had landed in Ibiza when the aircraft touched down in Paris. Their antics became so out of control the pilot alerted French air bosses that he would be making an emergency landing and diverted to Beauvais carrying 174 passengers. Just weeks before another Ryanair flight saw up to 30 men run amok on a flight to Ibiza from Prestwick. They guzzled spirits, jumped on seats, shouted, swore and threatened crew and passengers. Spanish police were called on to the flight when it landed and it is understood they removed five members of the group.","50-second video shows rows of passengers loudly singing songs .

"By . Martha Cliff for MailOnline . Selfridges is hardly your average department store with the famous black and yellow retailer playing host to some rather unusual facilities. From hairdressers and sushi bars to ice rinks and even putting forward an application to open a Zoo on it's  store, the store is always finding new ways to stand out. So it comes as no surprise that the iconic shop has decided to add a cinema to it's ever growing amenities and according to them it is the first of it's kind. Selfridges department store opens the world's first in-store cinema tomorrow . Selfridges claim that the theatre that will open in it's flagship store on Oxford Street, will be the first to be operated within a department store, screening a series of classic and contemporary films. The cinema, in collaboration with the independent chain Everyman, will initially screen films selected by designers from the store's Masters campaign. The campaign showcases the work of 12 influential designers such as Paul Smith, Marc Jacobs and Oscar de la Renta who were chosen for their 'idiosyncratic impact on fashion over the past 50 years'. The cinema is a theatre with a difference with sofas and cushions rather than traditional fold up seats . The 12 Masters' film selection is made up from their favourite movies including Bruce Robinson's Withnail and I chosen by Paul Smith, Ken Russell's The Devils chosen by Rick Owens and Sofia Coppola's The Virgin Suicides selected by Marc Jacobs. As well as old favourites the cinema will showcase several new releases the first being  Magic in the Moonlight, the new Woody Allen film starring Colin Firth and Emma Stone and set in the 1920s on the French Riviera. The film will offer Woody Allen fans an opportunity to see it first with the film being screened on September 18 ahead of its official release the next day. The cinema will screen a range of classic and contemporary movies . Selfridges have collaborated with independent cinema chain Everyman in order to launch their very first movie theatre . The theatre opens its doors tomorrow, when it will screen the Audrey Hepburn classic Breakfast At Tiffany's, as well as Breathless, The Grand Budapest Hotel and The Wolf Of Wall Street. For Linda Hewson, creative director of Selfridges a movie theatre was an obvious choice for such a visually led store. 'As a store, we continuously challenge ourselves to offer customers great retail theatre. 'Shopping is a fun form of escapism, so to offer our customers access to the escapist power of cinema within Selfridges, makes for a great combination. The first 12 films were selected by designers from the store's Master's campaign . 'With this in mind, Selfridges is delighted to launch a fully-fledged cinema in collaboration with Everyman within our Oxford Street store.' Everyman Cinemas chief executive Andrew Myers agrees that shopping and cinema go hand in hand. 'What a perfect way to relax after a hard day of shopping - put your feet up and let us spoil you with a nibble, a drink and a great film. 'We know that bringing the Everyman experience into the heart of the UK's greatest department store will be enjoyed by both our audiences.' Ticket prices will range from £7.50 for kids' club screenings to £20 for an evening seat. The cinema is scheduled to run until spring next year.","The famous shop will open the world's first in-store cinema .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott for MailOnline . Cellphones these days are seemingly more time-consuming for college students than any other activity, finds a new study - and that includes sleeping. According to a Baylor University study, female college students spend an average of 10 hours a day on their phones, with male students only slightly behind, screen-bound for an average of eight hours. 'That's astounding,' said researcher James Roberts, Ph.D., at the Hankamer School of Business. 'Addictions to this seemingly indispensable piece of technology [are becoming] an increasingly realistic possibility.' Transfixed: 'Addictions to this seemingly indispensable piece of technology are becoming an increasingly realistic possibility,' says Hankamer School of Business professor James Roberts . In the study - based on an online survey of 164 college students - 60per cent of participants admitted they may actually be addicted to their cell phones. Texting took up the most time, an average of 94 minutes a day; followed by sending emails, which took up 48 minutes, checking Facebook, which accounted for 38 minutes, surfing the internet, which took 34 minutes, and listening to their iPods, an average of 26 minutes a day. Men were found to send the same number of emails as women, though they spent less time firing them off. Perhaps, Dr Roberts says, because men send 'shorter, more utilitarian messages.' And gone are the days when youths were hooked on games. It's social media portals like Instagram and Pinterest which are most strongly associated with cellphone addiction now, according to Dr Roberts. Glued: Cara Delevingne (left) is rarely seen in public not clutching her phone, singer Carrie Underwood (center) has admitted that her cellphone is her 'best friend' and Justin Bieber (right) is another heavy offender . The psychological roots of this device dependence could run deep. 'Cellphones may wind up being an escape mechanism from their classrooms,' Dr Roberts says. 'Some people use a cellphone to dodge an awkward situation. They may pretend to take a call, send a text or check their phones.' A similar study conducted by Seton Hall University in 2012 yielded similar results. It found that young adults check their phones an average of 60 times per day and send out an average of 3,200 text messages per month. Researchers noted that impulsiveness of this kind is a well-known component of substance addictions. Indeed, many participants in the Baylor study agreed with the statement: 'I get agitated when my cellphone is not in sight.' Country crooner Carrie Underwood has admitted: 'My cellphone is my best friend. It's my lifeline to the outside world. But perhaps all of us should be leaning more towards the Jack Nicholson school of thought. 'I don't even own a cellphone,' the king of cool once said.","The Baylor University study found that male students come close, spending eight hours a day fixed to their phones .

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . Ferrero, the company which makes Nutella, is the world's biggest buyer of hazelnut and may be forced to increase product prices due to the nut shortage . The price of Nutella could be on the rise due to a global shortage of hazelnuts caused by a washout of crops following bad weather. The cost of hazelnuts has increased by more than 60 per cent already this year after hail storms and frost obliterated crops in Turkey, where about 70 per cent of the world’s hazelnuts are harvested. It has resulted in a stark increase in the wholesale price of the nut, which has risen to £6,300 ($10,500) per tonne from just £3,900 ($6,500) per tonne in February. While the extent of the damage to the hazelnut flowers on Turkey’s Black Sea coast is not yet fully evident, it is feared about 300,000 tonnes of the crop could have been damaged in March’s poor weather. It comes after continued warnings about the rising cost of cocoa which has continued to soar as demand outstrips production. Experts have warned that a growing taste for chocolate in Asia – particularly in China – means cocoa farmers will need more help to provide a greater amount to export or manufacturers will be forced to use less cocoa in their products. It is feared the rising demand could become unsustainable by 2020, unless more is done to help cocoa growing communities. The threat of a global shortage of both cocoa and hazelnuts comes as bad news for chocolate makers – many of whom combine the ingredients for their products. Michael Stevens, a trader at Edinburgh-based Freeworld Trading, said the rising price of the nut was a worry for market leaders. The price of hazelnuts has risen from £3,900 per tonne in February to £6,300 per tonne this month (file picture) He told The Guardian: ‘Buyers are living hand to mouth. Some people had contracts already [pre-dating the frost] and they are not going to get them. ‘A lot of people are still uncovered in the market and people that thought they were covered are now in the market again.’ It is especially a worry for Nutella, which claims to contain more than 50 hazelnuts per every 400g jar. Nutella currently costs between £1.75 and £2.25 in major UK supermarkets but may well face an increase if the price of hazelnuts continues to rise. According to the Italian Trade Agency, Ferrero - the company which makes and owns Ferrero Rocher and Nutella – is the world’s biggest buyer of hazelnuts, using 25% of the world's supply. Last month, Italian-based Ferrero confirmed it had bought Turkish company Oltan - one of the world leaders in the production and marketing of hazelnuts. In a statement, the Piedmont-based Ferrero gave no financial details but said Oltan had five production plants exporting to the European Union and other important markets. Cadbury, which also makes a range of nut-related chocolate bars including its Whole Nut bar, may also have to look into addressing prices of its products to reflect the rising ingredient costs. However, American-based Mondelez – the company which owns Cadbury - declined to comment on whether it had plans to increase the price of its products. MailOnline has contacted Ferrero for comment.","Price of hazelnuts has risen from £3,900 per tonne in February to £6,300 .

"By . Julie Cook . Watching . my five-year-old son Alex playing with my nine-month-old daughter . Adriana on her play mat, I sometimes have to pinch myself. Most mothers . think of their offspring as little miracles - but mine really are. For . had I become pregnant with them while living in Britain, I don't think . my children would be here now - in fact, I might have still been . childless. It's a bold statement, but one I feel is justified by my . experience. I became pregnant with Alex when my husband Cornel and I . were living in Venice - I'd previously suffered two early miscarriages. The first was in 2004 in England, when I was nine weeks pregnant. I'd . hoped it was just 'one of those things'. I was only 26 at the time and . had conceived easily. Julie Cook was pregnant in Italy where the hormone progesterone is given to help prevent miscarriage . But when I had a second one four years afterwards at just six weeks, I began to worry. Was there something wrong with me? This . time around, I was living in Italy as Cornel, now 34, was working there . as a pianist. My doctor in Venice suggested there might be underlying . problems, but told me to wait a while and try again. Then I became . pregnant for a third time. But just days after a positive pregnancy . test, when I was five weeks' pregnant, I started bleeding very heavily. Like . all women who've had more than one loss, I knew the telltale signs of . miscarriage all too well: painful cramping in the stomach, heavy blood . loss and an intuitive sense of doom. And, as I felt myself lose my third . baby, a flicker of fight came over me. 'Go to my doctor, please,' I begged Cornel. 'See if there's anything he can give me.' I didn't dare move from my bed - terrified that if I did, the worst would happen. Julie Cook - who again took the hormone for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy - with second child Ariana . Cornel . rushed off to the hospital where my doctor worked. An hour later, he . came back clutching a paper bag from the pharmacy. I asked him what it . was. It was the hormone progesterone. I'd read about progesterone and . knew it was important to help women conceive. Many doctors even call it . 'the pregnancy hormone' - so important is it to sustaining a pregnancy. I'd . also read a deficiency in it could lead to problems: progesterone . causes the lining of the womb to thicken to prepare a supportive . environment for a fertilised egg. Without it, the lining can . sometimes not be sufficiently thick for the embryo to implant and be . sustained. I had no idea if I was deficient in progesterone or not. But . something told me to give this pregnancy every chance. So I had the . medication (it came in pessary form) and lay on the bed for a few hours. I got up terrified of what I'd find, but the bleeding    had stopped. Next . day, despite my spending a sleepless night worrying, the bleeding . didn't start again. A few days later I saw my doctor, who told me to . keep taking the pessaries. For the first 12 weeks of pregnancy I . carried on taking the progesterone daily and, sure enough, I had no . further bleeding. I'd read on the internet that some women said they . felt side-effects from the treatment such as tiredness, but I had none. At my 12-week scan, I didn't dare believe all was well, but it was - on screen a tiny, healthy little foetus was bobbing about. At . about 13 weeks, I weaned myself off the progesterone. I was petrified, . like a junkie giving up a drug. My doctor told me there was no danger if . I stopped suddenly - reassuring me that, by 12 weeks, the placenta took . over the production of hormones necessary to sustain pregnancy. But . when he saw how nervous I was, he suggested I take one every other day . instead, until I ran out. I still worried that if I stopped I'd bleed . and lose the baby. But I didn't. I had no more bleeding and, at 38 . weeks, I went into labour naturally and gave birth to Alex. I was . thrilled to be a mother, but when we moved back to the UK about ten . months later, I spoke to other mums who'd suffered early miscarriage. I . told them about the progesterone I'd been given in Italy and their eyes . widened. Julie and husband Cornel, 34, pictured with their children, lived in Italy as he was working there as a pianist . 'You have to jump through so many hoops to get it here,' they all told me. I looked into it. I read that in Italy, as in many . other European countries such as France, progesterone is given out far . more freely than in the UK - indeed, progesterone is among the most . commonly used drugs in pregnancy in France and in Italy, with almost a . third of women at risk of miscarriage being prescribed it. While . there are no official figures on the hormone's use in the UK, 'from . experience it seems there are higher rates of progesterone prescribing . in Europe', says Professor Ellis Downes, a consultant obstetrician and . gynaecologist at The Portland Hospital for Women and Children in London. This . is despite the fact that in Italy, for instance, the official approach . is similar to the UK, with progesterone only given to women who've had . 'recurrent' miscarriage - usually taken as three or more losses. While . in the UK it appears that women need to try harder to get it, even if . they fit this criteria, in Italy doctors are more likely to give it to . women to try as they don't think it can hurt - even in some cases before . they have suffered three miscarriages. I'd had two losses, but my . Italian doctor thought it was better to try something - ie, give me . progesterone - than do  nothing. Five years after Alex was born, I was . pregnant again. Happily, we were back in Italy where my husband was . again working. When I saw my doctor - a new one this time - and told her . of my previous losses, she didn't question my belief that progesterone . had saved Alex. Without even sending me for tests to see if my . progesterone levels were low, she scribbled something on a prescription . and sent me off to the pharmacy. The proportion of women offered pain relief and support after miscarriage . Again, I took the hormone for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Nine months later I had a healthy baby - Adriana. I . will never know if progesterone helped me stay pregnant or if those . first early pregnancies were doomed to fail anyway. Maybe I never was . progesterone-deficient. No one ever tested my levels, so who knows? But . I think that even if the progesterone did not help me, it helped me . believe I had a safety net; which no doubt helped me keep a positive . attitude - something all too important after a miscarriage. So why is progesterone not so freely given in the UK? Should women who've suffered recurrent miscarriage have the option? Professor . Downes believes the hormone can be helpful, and describes himself as 'a . fan of giving women progesterone because it's perfectly safe and is a . helpful thing to give to women who've had miscarriages before'. 'Progesterone . is a smooth muscle relaxant and it's a very important part of . pregnancy. Some women are deficient and the medical logic is it makes . sense to give it to them. We don't fully understand why some women are . deficient in progesterone - there seems to be a wide variation in the . “normal” level of progesterone needed in early pregnancy - but there is a . lot of ongoing research to try to identify why some women have higher . levels than others.' Opinion here is divided over the benefits of . progesterone. Ruth Bender-Atik, national director of the Miscarriage . Association, says there is a lack of evidence it helps: 'What's more, we . don't know if there are any disadvantages to using it.' Julie Cook's son Alex, 5 with Adriana at about 4 months old . Professor Downes says there is 'conflicting evidence over whether progesterone works or not'. 'What's . difficult is, if you give progesterone to a woman who has miscarried . and she doesn't miscarry, you ask is it due to the progesterone or . something else?' The good news is that a major trial involving more . than 800 women in Britain and the Netherlands could help settle the . question of whether women who've miscarried should be given . progesterone. The hope is the study will show clinicians that . progesterone does make a difference, and encourage them to give it out . as a result. In the trial, which started in 2010, women who've had three . recurrent miscarriages or more are given progesterone or a placebo in . the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. The results will be published this . October. Would I have gone on to carry a pregnancy successfully . without progesterone? NHS figures suggest about 20 per cent of . pregnancies miscarry in the first three months and many women who lose . these babies do go on to have successful subsequent pregnancies. Maybe, . I might have been one of those fortunate women. But it's hard not to . believe that progesterone saved Alex and Adriana. I just hope other . women are given the chance I was.","Julie Cook suffered multiple miscarriages until she took progesterone .

Kirobo the robot is stranded aboard the International space Station indefinitely . He is based on the already existing kit called Robi and stands 13.4 inches tall and weighs 2.2lbs. The language processing technology was contributed by Toyota and Kibo speaks in a synthesized voice. A camera on his head is fitted with facial recognition software. 'I'm a little tired, so I think I'll rest a while, but I hope you'll look up at the sky sometimes and think of me,' he said in a video named 'Last message form the universe' posted to the project web site. He was sent up with Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata and was able to talk to him in his own language which has been programmed into his circuits. Kiboro is the work of the The Kibo Robot Project and his Japanese maker Dentsu after an appeal by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. Kibo also keeps the rest of the crew amused, take pictures and update his Twitter account via a robot brother back on Earth as part of his mission to be a ‘social robot’.

Kibo was designed by renowned robot designer Tomotaka Takahashi whose earlier creation EVOLTA climbed a rope to the top of the Grand Canyon. Kibo’s name was decided after more than 2,400 titles were submitted as part of a competition. The robot has the distinction of being the first to speak in space. At the start of its mission, it said: 'On August 21, 2013, a robot took one small step towards a brighter future for all. Good morning to everyone on Earth. 'This is Kirobo. 'I am the world's first talking robot astronaut. 'Nice to meet you.' Kirobo continued that a backup crew member called Mirata was providing support on Earth before adding: 'Mirata, please stand by, I will now send a photo to Earth.' Mirata is a similar make and model counterpart robot for Kirobo, based at Tokyo's Research Centre for Advanced Science and Technology. It was first unveiled at a press conference in June last year.

"By . Sarah Griffiths for MailOnline . The vast majority of readers find news articles and blog posts with deliberately misleading or mysterious headlines annoying. And now Facebook is on a quest to 'weed out' links to ‘click-baiting’ stories that  are  designed to make people click on them. The social network says that by monitoring how long people spend reading news articles, as well as how they interact with them, it can prioritise the best content that pops up in people's News Feeds. Facebook is on a quest to relegate links to ‘click-baiting’ stories that don’t live up to their promises and are merely designed to make people click on them. The example above was given by Facebook in a blog post. The social network has tweaked its News Feed algorithm so that rankings of such articles are lowered . Facebook has tweaked its News Feed algorithm to lower the ranking of click-bait links. In a blog post, research scientist Khalid El-Arini, and Joyce Tang, a product specialist at Facebook, said the firm has made improvements ‘to help people find the posts and links from publishers that are most interesting and relevant, and to continue to weed out stories that people frequently tell us are spammy and that they don’t want to see.’ Facebook said a survey revealed that 80 per cent of its users prefer headlines what make the content of an article crystal clear, so they can work out if a link is worth clicking on. The experts wrote: ‘Over time, stories with “click-bait” headlines can drown out content from friends and Pages that people really care about.’ The social network has tweaked its News Feed algorithm to lower the ranking of click-bait links, by monitoring how long people read news stories for. It already manipulates which stories appear high up in news feeds (pictured) so users get the most appropriate content, the company said. Facebook defines ‘click-baiting’ as when a publisher posts a link with a headline that encourages people to click to see more, without telling them much information about what they will see. Posts like these tend to get a lot of clicks, which means that these posts get shown to more people, and get shown higher up in News Feed. But new changes to the algorithm could mean they will pushed to the bottom of a pile of content. To crack down on the practice, Facebook is lowering the ranking of click-bait links, so that links with clear headlines are more likely to show up in a user’s news feed. Mr El-Arini and Ms Tang said that Facebook is doing this by measuring how long people spend reading stories after clicking on them, as well as observing if they ‘like’ or comment on an article. ‘If they click through to a link and then come straight back to Facebook, it suggests that they didn’t find something that they wanted,’ the pair wrote. ‘If a lot of people click on the link, but relatively few people click Like, or comment on the story when they return to Facebook, this also suggests that people didn’t click through to something that was valuable to them. It is thought that websites merely trying to score hits  will suffer as a result of the change, but that large, playful websites, which sometimes use the technique, won’t be affected. Facebook said: ‘A small set of publishers who are frequently posting links with click-bait headlines that many people don’t spend time reading after they click through may see their distribution decrease in the next few months. ‘We’re making these changes to ensure that click-bait content does not drown out the things that people really want to see on Facebook.’","Facebook defines ‘click-baiting’ as  links with a headline that encourage people to click to see more, without being clear about what they can expect .

"By . Margot Peppers for MailOnline . Tao Porchon-Lynch begins every morning at 5am to teach her students how to bend, stretch and master the most difficult yoga poses - despite being nearly a century old. The 96-year-old, who was raised in India and currently lives in Westchester County, New York, has been practicing yoga for more than 70 years, and she shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, she has recently added ballroom dancing to her repertoire, and she dances circles around her dance partner Vard Margaryn, who, at 26, is a whopping 70 years her junior. Nearing a century: Tao Porchon-Lynch, 96, who was raised in India and currently lives in Westchester County, New York, has been practicing yoga for more than 70 years, and she shows no signs of slowing down . Seasoned pro: The yogi (pictured teaching a class at her home on August 21) wakes up at 5am every morning to teach dozens of students how to bend, stretch and do difficult yoga poses . While she has only been dancing competitively since the Eighties, the nonagenarian has won an estimated 500 first place awards, mostly in her favorite category - ballroom tango. 'Yoga is the dance of the spirit,' she told the Huffington Post in 2013. 'Ballroom dancing is the physical awareness that comes from the joy within us.' Mrs Porchon-Lynch, who was born to a French father and an Indian mother, was signed as a fashion model in her youth. She also acted in movies including 1951's Show Boat and 1954 film The Last Time I Saw Paris, starring Elizabeth Taylor. She began pursuing yoga at age eight, and when she hit adulthood she decided to turn it into a full-time profession. Cutting her teeth: Mrs Porchon-Lynch (pictured in 1975), began pursuing yoga at age eight, and when she hit adulthood she decided to turn it into a full-time profession . Spiritual: '[Yoga] is like nature, everything is always recycled and brought full circle,' she says. 'I find that I can heal myself if I do what nature does. It's taken away stress and has helped me through crises' Now that she is in her nineties, the spirited yogi - whose husband of 20 years, Bill Lynch, died in 1982 - says that the ancient practice not only keeps her body young, but it improves her mind and soul as well. 'Yoga is the joining of our mind, body and spirit,' she explains. 'It is like nature, everything is always recycled and brought full circle. 'I find that I can heal myself if I do what nature does. It's taken away stress and has helped me through crises.' That's not to say that time hasn't taken an inevitable toll on her health; just a few years ago, she had to have a total hip replacement, and in 2011 she broke her wrist. Flashback: Born to a French father and an Indian mother, she was a model in her youth and also acted in movies including Show Boat and The Last Time I Saw Paris, starring Elizabeth Taylor. (Pictured in 1950) Neverending energy: She has also recently added ballroom dancing to her repertoire . But rather than let these injuries slow her down, Mrs Porchon-Lynch perseveres and feels younger and stronger every day. One of her secrets is a vegetarian diet of small portions, with the occasional glass of wine and piece of chocolate. 'I don't eat for the sake of eating,' said the petite 5ft 5in yogi, who maintains her weight at around 102lbs. Unlikely pair: The lively nonogenarian dances circles around her dance partner Vard Margaryn (pictured), who is a whopping 70 years her junior at 26 . Staying active: 'Yoga is the dance of the spirit,' she says. 'Ballroom dancing is the physical awareness that comes from the joy within us' 'No one should eat huge quantities of food. Be in touch with nature and the fruits of life. That will keep us healthy.' Not only does she keep a busy schedule with yoga classes, but Mrs Porchon-Lynch also embarks on numerous other endeavors - from publishing a book about meditation in 2011 to releasing a yoga DVD in 2013. A description of her book on Amazon reads: 'Tao is a living advertisement for how to tap into our human potential. She is unique in her ability to overcome the effects of aging to control her body and mind in harmony with Yoga’s principles.

'Tao's philosophy is: ""There is nothing we cannot do if we harness the power within us.""' She also helped establish the American Wine Society in 1967, and she frequently appears on the panel to judge various wine competitions.

"By . Sarah Griffiths for MailOnline . Astronomers have been scrutinising high-definition photos of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko sent back by the Rosetta spacecraft. And now a shortlist of five possible sites that could become the location for the first-ever landing on a comet, have been drawn up by the European Space Agency (Esa). In mid-November, Esa intends to send down a robot laboratory named Philae, which will harpoon itself to the comet's surface and carry out a battery of scientific tests, the results of which astronomers hope will help them work out how planets formed. Scroll down for videos . A shortlist of five possible sites that could become the location for the first-ever landing on a comet, have been drawn up by the European Space Agency, Three of them are on the 'head' of the rubber-dusk shaped Comet 67P, while two are on its 'body' (illustrated) Rosetta reached Comet 67P on August 6 after a 10-year chase through the Solar System to shed light on its surface. Esa has now identified five ‘candidate’ zones for landing, but has says that ‘choosing the right landing site is a complex process’. One final location will be selected, as well as a back-up. The topography must be relatively flat and clear and the surface stable. There also has to be sufficient sunlight to recharge the lander's batteries beyond its initial 64-hour lifetime - yet not so much as to cause overheating. At the same time, though, the site must offer the most potential to find scientific treasure. Comet 67P comprises two lobes joined by a narrow neck, which make it look a little bit like a rubber duck in space. Zoom in on the image below to find out where Rosetta is at the moment . In mid-November, Esa intends to send down a robot laboratory, Philae, which will harpoon itself to the comet's surface and carry out a battery of scientific tests. This is an artist's impression of Philae on the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko . The selection of five possible sites was informed by images of the rocky body, including this . 3D image of comet 67P, which can be viewed using stereoscopic glasses with . red–green/blue filters. It was created by merging two images taken last . week by the Rosetta probe as it circled around the comet . Rosetta also recently measured the temperature of the comet and determined that its average surface temperature is about -70°C (-94°F). Although it may seem cold, that is actually 20 to 30°C (36 to 54°F) warmer than predicted for a comet at that distance, suggesting its surface will be quite dusty in addition to being icy. 'This result is very interesting, since it gives us the first clues on the composition and physical properties of the comet’s surface,' says VIRTIS principal investigator Fabrizio Capaccioni from Rome, Italy. This suggests that much of the surface must be dusty, because darker material heats up and emits heat more readily than ice. Three of the candidate sites are on the smaller lobe, or head of the 'duck,' and two are on the larger lobe, or the body, Esa said. Comets are believed by astrophysicists to be ancient ice and dust left from the building of the Solar System around 4.6 billion years ago. This cosmic rubble is essentially a time capsule - the oldest, least-touched material in our stellar neighbourhood. It is hoped that understanding its chemical and physical composition will give experts insights into how the planets formed after the sun flared into light. Rosetta is equipped with an array of sensors to help answer the question, but the biggest discoveries could be made by the 10 instruments aboard the 220lb (100kg) Philae lander. The 2.5 mile (4km) comet is on a six-and-a-half-year orbit around the sun and is currently 324 million miles (522 million km) from the star. For a sense of scale, it is about three times the size of Ben Nevis and Rosetta is the size of a car with 105ft (32 metre) wings. At their closest approach on August 13 2015, the comet and Rosetta will be 114 million miles (185 million km) from the sun, meaning an eightfold increase in the light received from the sun compared with present levels, Esa said. It took Rosetta two weeks before the spacecraft sent back its first detailed images of the comet’s rocky surface. One image revealed a deep gorge in the centre and the comet's ‘head’, with parallel lines that look like cliffs. It also showed a cluster of building-sized boulders on the ‘neck’ of the comet. This is an artist's impression of the Rosetta orbiter deploying the Philae lander to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. After an extensive mapping phase by the orbiter between now and September, a final landing site will be selected for Philae to conduct in situ measurements in November . This . image was taken on the 15 of August. It shows a cluster of . building-sized boulders on the ‘neck’ region. In mid-November, Esa . intends to send down . a robot laboratory, Philae, which will harpoon itself to the comet's . surface and carry out a battery of scientific tests . Three of the candidate sites are on the . smaller lobe, or head of the ""duck,"" and two are on the larger lobe, or . the body, Esa said. This image shows the comet's ‘head’ os smaller lobe, with parallel linear features that look like cliffs . Taken on the 14th August, this image was taken from a distance of about 62 miles (100km) from the comet. Comets are believed by astrophysicists to . be ancient ice and dust left from the building of the Solar System . around 4.6 billion years ago . The Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research has released a 3D version of the comet, which appears to jump out of the screen if you wear stereoscopic glasses. ‘I was impressed that on the neck that connects the two parts of the comet there is something like the side of a mountain,' mission director, Paolo Ferri, told MailOnline. 'It's like looking at the Alps on a very high wall. It is incredible. It makes you feel like you want to climb it, and on one of the few areas that seem to be flat there are boulders 20 to 30 metres wide, they look like houses.’ Described as ‘the sexiest, most fantastic mission ever’, Rosetta will spend more than a year analysing the comet to help uncover the secrets to life on Earth. The comet has been dubbed the ‘rubber duck’ in space and recent photos have revealed that its target, 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is actually what is known as a ‘contact binary’. This means it is likely two comets stitched together, in what could turn out to be both a blessing and a curse. It could have been fractured in the past or it could be two different objects that very slowly came into contact at speeds of a few metres per second. This irregular structure makes it harder for scientists to calculate the comet's gravitational pull, to help steer the probe. Rosetta recently measured the temperature of the comet and determined that its average surface temperature is about -70°C (-94°F).","Shortlist of five possible landing sites have .

But now a team of researchers have identified a new weakness in Android, Windows and iOS mobile operating systems that could be used to steal personal information from unsuspecting users. Experts found the method was successful 92 per cent of the time when they tried to hack Gmail accounts and said that other apps were also easily accessible using the new technique. Scroll down for video . A team of researchers have identified a new weakness in Android, Windows and iOS mobile operating systems. They found that their method was successful 92 per cent of the time when they tried to hack Gmail accounts (stock image) and said that other apps were also easily accessible . Scientists at the University of California, Riverside Bourns College of Engineering and the University of Michigan demonstrated the hack in an Android phone. They found it was successful between 82 per cent and 92 per cent of the time on six of the seven popular apps they tested, including Gmail, Chase Bank and H&R Block - a tax filing app. Amazon was the only app they tested that was difficult to penetrate, with just a 48 per cent success rate. The experts predicted there was a security risk with so many apps running on the same shared operating system, which gave them the idea of pinpointing the vulnerability. ‘The assumption has always been that these apps can't interfere with each other easily,’ said Zhiyun Qian, of the Computer Science and Engineering Department at UC Riverside. ‘We show that assumption is not correct and one app can in fact significantly impact another and result in harmful consequences for the user.’ The hack works by accidentally downloading a malicious app, which gives a hacker access to a newly-discovered public side channel - numbers describing the shared memory of a process, which can accessed without asking a smartphone user’s permission. This shared memory is a common operating system feature in Windows, Android (pictured left) and iOS (right) operating systems . The computer scientists found their hacking technique was successful between 82 per cent and 92 per cent of the time on six of the seven popular apps they tested. These included: . Gmail - 92 per cent . H&R Block - 92 per cent . Newegg - 86 per cent . WebMD - 85 per cent . Chase Bank - 83 per cent . Hotels.com - 83 per cent . Amazon - 48 per cent . Researchers hacked into apps by getting a mobile user to download a seemingly benign - but in fact malicious - app such as one for background wallpaper on a phone. Once it was installed, the experts could exploit a newly discovered 'public side channel' containing a shared memory of processes, which can be accessed without asking a smartphone user’s permission. They said that shared memory is a common operating system feature, which efficiently allows processes to share data. While they only used it to exploit the Android system, the experts believe the method would work on Apple and Windows operating systems too. The experts monitored changes in the shared memory and linked them to users’ actions such as logging into Gmail or taking a picture of a cheque they wanted to deposit via the Chase Bank app. They showed that it is possible to track which apps people are using in real time. To keep smartphones as secure as possible, Dr Qian advises users not to install untrusted apps, which could give hackers (illustrated with a stock image) access. He said that in the future, side channels should be eliminated or more carefully regulated within operating systems . In order to launch an attack, they started the hack at the precise moment the user logged into an app or took a photo and they did this inconspicuously by calculating the timing. ‘By design, Android allows apps to be pre-empted or hijacked,’ Dr Qian said. ‘But the thing is, you have to do it at the right time so the user doesn't notice. We do that and that's what makes our attack unique.’ He explained that Amazon’s app was more difficult to attack because it allows one activity to lead to almost any other activity, which increases the difficulty of guessing which activity someone will conduct next. To keep smartphones as secure as possible, Dr Qian advised users not to install untrusted apps. He said that side channels should be eliminated or more carefully regulated and operating systems more carefully designed to enable them to be easy to use, but also secure.

But now a collaboration between two Seattle-based firms has created a bike that’s handlebars can be used as a bike lock – so cyclists don’t have to lug a heavy lock around with them. The Denny bike not only features a smart lock, but also has lots of safety features, an automatic gear shifter, built-in lights and a motor to help cyclists up hills. Scroll down for video . The Denny bike (pictured) not only features handlebars that can be used as a removeable lock, but also has an automatic gear shifter, built-in lights and has a motor to help cyclists up hills . While the design started as a concept, it will be available to buy next year. The Denny bike was the brainchild of designers from Seattle-based design firm Teague and Sizemore Bicycle. It won Oregon Manifest’s Bike Design Project, which aims to create the ultimate urban bike. Its creators say: ‘The Denny bike is about returning the rider…to those early days of carefree riding, when cycling was just about “get up and go” freedom - the reason we all fell in love with bikes in the first place.’ They were inspired to create the bike to suit a life in Seattle so riders ‘don’t have to worry about the hills, rain or an impromptu farmer's market trip.'

Security features: . Electric and built-in features: . Safety features: . Launch date: . The bike features rectangular handlebars that can be removed and used as a lock. This means that the bike can be secured to a railing in a number of ways, while cyclists do not need to carry around an extra security device. There is an inbuilt-motor so that flagging riders can rely on electricity to help power them up steep hills – or along flat surfaces if they are feeling lazy. Electric gears change automatically so that cyclists can maintain a steady speed, similar to  systems used by professional cyclists. The battery also powers LED lights and is slim and light enough that it can be carried in a backpack for then it needs to be recharged. The lights are automatically on so that people don't forget to turn them on when it grows dark and the rear light becomes stronger when a cyclist brakes. The Denny also has indicators that are activated by flicking the left or right brake forward, PocketLint reported. Other little details make the bike easier to use on a daily basis, such as storage in the form of an elasticated net and mudguards with little brushes, which are designed to break up large water droplets to prevent them splashing a cyclist . The creators at Sizemore Bicycle claim: ‘Denny is the “all in” cycling solution that meets security, safety and importantly convenience needs.’ It will be available to buy next year via Fuji Bikes, although no price has yet been announced.

The thinning snow could influence the Arctic ecosystem, with tiny microscopic plants that are key to the Arctic food chain growing beneath the sea ice, the research said. The data was collected Nasa and the University of Washington using ice buoys, aircraft surveys and historic data from ice floes staffed by Soviet scientists from the late 1950s. 'The snow cover is like a shield that can insulate sea ice,' said Dr Son Nghiem of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 'In this study, we had thousands of measurements of snow depth on sea ice to thoroughly validate Nasa's aircraft observations. This graph shows the change in springtime Arctic snow depth compared to the average (shown in red). The data come from Soviet drifting ice stations (1950-1987),  Ice Mass Balance buoys (1993-2013), and the Nasa IceBridge airborne project (2009-2013) University of Washington graduate student Melinda Webster uses a probe to measure snow depth and verify Nasa airborne data. She is walking on sea ice near Barrow, Alaska . 'We knew Arctic sea ice was decreasing, but the snow cover has become so thin that its shield has become a veil.' Scientists believe the reason for the thinning snow may be that the surface freeze-up is happening later in the fall so the year's heaviest snowfalls, in September and October. What thinner snow will mean for the ice is not certain. Deeper snow actually shields ice from cold air, so a thinner blanket may allow the ice to grow thicker during the winter. On the other hand, thinner snow cover may allow the ice to melt earlier in the springtime. Thinner snow could also impact animals that use the snow to make dens, and for low-light microscopic plants that grow underneath the sea ice. Snow has thinned from 14 inches to 9 inches (36cm to 23cm) in the western regions. It has also thinned by 13 inches to 6 inches (33 cm to 15 cm) over the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, west and north of Alaska, respectively . Melinda Webster measuring snow depth outside Barrow, Alaska (left). Scientists believe the reason for the thinning snow may be that the surface freeze-up is happening later in the fall so the year's heaviest snowfalls, in September and October . The new results support a 15-year-old UW-led study in which Russian and American scientists first analysed the historic Arctic Ocean snow measurements. That paper detected a slight decline in spring snow depth that the authors believed, even then, was due to a shorter ice-covered season. 'The delay in sea ice freeze-up could be changing the way that heat is transported in the Arctic, which would, in turn, affect precipitation patterns,' said first author Melinda Webster, an oceanography graduate student at the University of Washington. 'That's going to be a very interesting question in the future.' Research suggests that some Arctic lakes store more greenhouse gases than they emit into the atmosphere. This counters a widely-held scientific view that thawing permafrost accelerates atmospheric warming. The study shows that permafrost rich in organic material will see the growth of mosses and other plants flourish, leading to greater amounts of carbon absorption. Supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the study was published earlier this month in the journal Nature and focused on thermokarst lakes. These occur when permafrost thaws and create surface depressions that fill with melted fresh water, converting what was previously frozen land into lakes. The research suggests that Arctic thermokarst lakes are 'net climate coolers' when observed over longer time scales, namely several thousand years, although they initially warm the climate. The researchers observed that roughly 5,000 years ago, thermokarst lakes in ice-rich regions of North Siberia and Alaska began cooling, instead of warming the atmosphere. 'Until now, we've only thought of thermokarst lakes as positive contributors to climate warming,' said lead researcher Dr Katey Walter Anthony, associate research professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks Institute of Northern Engineering.","Snow has thinned 14 inches to 9 inches (36cm-23cm) in western regions .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . Some videos and images taken from the ISS are so incredible that they can leave you questioning their authenticity. But this time-lapse of an aurora surrounding the ISS as it completes an orbit of our planet is very much the real deal. The amazing footage was captured by Esa astronaut Alexander Gerst on the station last week. Above can be seen an animation of the moment Esa astronaut Alexander Gerst and his crewmates on the ISS spottted an aurora around the ISS. The green light is caused by the interaction of solar wind with particles in Earth's atmosphere. Part of the huge solar array can also be seen moving (credit: Esa/Nasa) The time-lapse was created by photographs taken on board the ISS by members of the Expedition 40 crew. There are two types of aurora - Aurora Borealis, which means ‘dawn of the north’, and Aurora Australis’, known as ‘dawn of the south.’ As their names imply, the former are seen in the northern hemisphere and the latter in the southern hemisphere. They are caused when electrically charged particles from the sun enter the Earth’s atmosphere. These so-called geomagnetic storms occur when a solar wind or cloud of magnetic field hits the Earth’s magnetic field. Usually the charged particles from the sun are deflected by the Earth’s magnetic field, but some do manage to enter the atmosphere and collide with gas particles. These collisions emit light. As a result, auroras are most common around the magnetic poles and are most often seen in areas with little light pollution. Auroral displays appear in many colours although pale green and pink are the most common. Shades of red, yellow, green, blue, and violet have also been reported. The common, greenish-yellow colour is caused by colliding oxygen molecules approximately 60 miles (96km) above Earth. Rare, red auroras are produced by oxygen molecules situated much higher up, at around 200 miles (320km). Nitrogen produces blue or purplish-red aurora. It shows the station orbiting the planet as normal before green lights begin to come into view. The ISS then flies right through the aurora, revealing a stunning sight that only a handful of people have seen with their own eyes. ‘We flew right through a massive aurora after last week’s solar mass ejection,’ Gerst, from Germany, commented. The ISS completes an orbit every 92 minutes, but sights of this sort are fairly rare. While auroras have certainly been spotted from space before, it’s not all that common for the station to fly through one. This is because the station’s orbit generally remains fairly close to the the equator, so it doesn’t venture too far towards the poles of our planet. It is around the North and South pole where auroras are generally most apparent, as this is where Earth’s magnetic fields are most concentrated. Auroras are caused by the interaction of solar wind with magnetically charged particles in the atmosphere. However, during periods of increased solar activity the amount of solar wind hitting Earth increases. This means there are more collisions taking place in Earth’s atmosphere and, consequently, this can push the lights closer to Earth’s equator. It is on occasions like this that more regions of Earth are able to witness the Northern or Southern Lights, with auroras sometimes reported as far south as the UK during these events. And it seems that a recent increase in solar activity also treated the residents of the ISS to the fascinating sight. The ISS (pictured) completes an orbit every 92 minutes, but sights of this sort are fairly rare. While auroras have certainly been spotted from space before, it’s not all that common for the station to fly through one. This is because the station’s orbit generally keeps it fairly near the equator . The astronauts are continuing their groundbreaking research on the ISS, with a new crew set to travel to the station next month, while Russian cosmonauts are also preparing for a spacewalk today. And recently Alexander Gerst took part in a live Facebook Q&A to answer questions from people on Earth. One included Sir Richard Branson, who asked: ‘What do you think the role of astronauts will be in 50 years’ time? Pioneers? Guides? Or the norm?’ Gerst responded: ‘My hope would be that in 50 years from now, space travellers will not only be professional Agency astronauts, but that everybody should have a realistic chance to make the incredible experience I am having right now. ‘Anyway, I hope there will still be pioneers out there who will fly to destinations farther away.’ Alexander Gerst (pictured) is part of Expedition 40 on the ISS. Next month they will be welcoming three new crewmembers to the space station when three of the current crew return to Earth. Gerst has been prolific on Twitter (@Astro_Alex) and frequently tweets stunning images and video from space .","Esa astronaut Alexander Gerst has captured stunning footage from the ISS .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard for MailOnline . Tickr asks users to post short 20-second videos in the place of photos . A bit of filter-action and the right angle can make anyone look good on Tinder. But there has been a backlash against the dating-app, and others like it, which relies almost exclusively on appearance to create matches. Now a competitor is gearing up to launch an iPhone app  that could mean the end of these mismatches. The London-based service is called Tickr and will ask users to post videos in the place of heavily-filtered photos. It is currently available online, and an app version is due to go live next month. Users have to upload clips that are around 20 seconds long, showing a part of their personality or their hobbies. In a similar way to Tinder's rating system, users earn 'ticks' if they are liked and 'icks' if not. If two members both tick each other, Tickr announces a match and they can start talking through text or video messaging. 'If you just can't decide whether to tick 'em or ick 'em, just put a pin in it and click Stick. 'We'll save the video for you to watch later,' the company wrote on its website. In a similar way Tinder's rating system, users earn 'ticks' if they are liked and 'icks' if not. Then, if two members both tick each other, Tickr announces a match and they can start talking to one another through text or video messaging . Users can also go through profile pictures to find those they like, but the general aim is to provide a more 'genuine' dating experience by watching videos. Users can sign up at Trustyourtickr.com in advance of the iOS app launch and upload videos using a desktop. The first 5,000 people to sign up will get free lifetime membership. After that, it costs £10 ($17) a month. Chris de Burgh found her irresistible, and now scientists say that ladies wearing red really are more attractive to men. A new study claims that wearing the colour increases a woman's sex appeal and also makes her seem more approachable and competent. It found that women also find red attractive on men - but the effect isn't as powerful. Psychologists at Central China Normal University, in Wuhan, China, showed 280 heterosexual students 32 pictures of the opposite sex and asked them to rate them according to how attractive they found them. The people in the photos were wearing either blue, white or red. Male students found 'feminine' women wearing red the most attractive and also rated them highest for looking 'warm' and competent.","The service is called Tickr and will ask users to upload 20-second clips .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Cinnamon, Boris and Sylvester have become heroes in the scientific community. The cats have given up a small part of their genetic material to help researchers, for the first time, sequence the entire domestic cat genome. Cats can suffer the same diseases as humans - such as leukaemia and AIDS - and scientists say details about the cat genome could help doctors better understand these conditions. The researched involved an international team who were able to sequence the genome of Cinnamon, an Abyssinian cat living at the University of Missouri in Columbia (left) There have been a number of attempts at sequencing domestic cat DNA, but this is the first project to successfully map a domestic cat’s entire genome. It involved an international team who were able to sequence the genome of Cinnamon, an Abyssinian cat living at the University of Missouri in Columbia. Cinnamon was sequenced in 2007, but the technology at the time was only picked up about 60 per cent of her total DNA. A cat’s genome is of particular interest to geneticists because their genome hasn’t changed much since they first evolved.Scientists now hope to be able to compare a cat genomes to humans to see whether there are similarities, and why were are vulnerable to similar diseases . The team also looked at the genes of Boris, a cat from St Petersburg and Sylvester, a European wildcat, according to a report by Annalee Newitz in iO9. The cat’s genome is of particular interest to geneticists because it hasn’t changed much since the creatures first evolved. Scientists now hope to be able to compare a cat genomes to humans to see whether there are similarities, and why both are vulnerable to similar diseases. A separate project, the 99 Lives Cat Whole Genome Sequencing Initiative is also collecting DNA samples from cats worldwide. The work requires samples from cats that are neutered. The cats' leftover ovaries, uteruses and testicles contain DNA that can be extracted. They hope a full mapping of those 20,000 genes in different breeds could help pinpoint the genetic cause of distinguishing marks, like fur and eye colours and also cat health problems. It’s estimated that pet owners in the US spend $26 billion (£15.5 billion) a year on looking after their cat’s health. In the UK, the average cost of looking after a cat is £17,000 ($28,500) over its lifetime. Sequencing means determining the exact order of the bases in a strand of DNA. Because bases exist as pairs, and the identity of one of the bases in the pair determines the other member of the pair, researchers do not have to report both bases of the pair. In the most common type of sequencing used today, called sequencing by synthesis, DNA polymerase (the enzyme in cells that synthesises DNA) is used to generate a new strand of DNA. In the sequencing reaction, the enzyme incorporates into the new DNA strand individual nucleotides that have been chemically tagged with a fluorescent label. The reaction is different depending on which of the four nucleotides was incorporated. This method can generate 'reads' of 125 nucleotides in a row and billions of reads at a time. Researchers can use DNA sequencing to search for genetic variations and/or mutations that may play a role in the development or progression of a disease. T . The disease-causing change may be as small as the substitution, deletion, or addition of a single base pair or as large as a deletion of thousands of bases.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . The reason the Titanic hit an iceberg and sunk has been hotly debated for the past century. While some say it was due to human error, others say the unusual appearance of a large iceberg in a region of the Atlantic Ocean was the main factor. But now a paper claims it was not one or the other, but rather adverse weather conditions that drove icebergs south farther than usual. Scroll down for video . Researchers from the University of Sheffield say icebergs drifted farther south than usual in 1912. In this graphic the dotted line shows the sea-ice limit for April 1979-2013, the dashed line shows that in 1912 and the solid line shows the expected overall limit. Titanic's impact with an iceberg is marked by the 'X' The paper 'The iceberg risk in the Titanic year of 1912' was published in the journal Significance. Some researchers have argued that the iceberg responsible for the demise of the Titanic was sent on its deadly path by the closest approach of the moon to the Earth in 1,400 years. Texas State University researchers claimed in 2012 that a once-in-a-lifetime lunar event created a super-high tide on January 12, 1912. The tide dislodged icebergs from shallow waters off the coasts of Labrador and Newfoundland, filling shipping lanes with icebergs. The ice field in the area the Titanic sank was so thick with icebergs responding rescue ships were forced to slow down. But researchers from the University of Sheffield have now attempted to dispel this as a myth and claimed the risk is much greater now. It describes how the distance the iceberg that sunk the Titanic had drifted south was much farther than would have been expected at the time. While they admit stresses on the crew might have been a factor, they say the surprising appearance of such a large iceberg meant the ship’s fate was down to poor luck. ‘It is most likely that a combination of human errors associated with the captain not reducing speed - despite a number of ice reports reaching the vessel in the days before the collision - and possible variable rivet quality in the hull manufacture led to the tragedy,’ the authors write. ‘However, the question has often been raised: was the Titanic unlucky in sailing in a year with exceptional iceberg numbers?’ At 0240 GMT on 15 April 1912, the RMS Titanic struck a large iceberg while 400 miles (643km) from land. About 330ft (100 metres) of the hull below the waterline buckled, flooding the ship with water across several compartments. In just over 2.5 hours the ship sunk (illustrated), claiming 1,514 lives in the process . This photograph shows the iceberg which sank the Titanic. The Titanic only had visual sightings and a shipboard radio to guide it through iceberg-infested waters . While today there is an extensive ice harzard warning service in the northwest Atlantic, provided by the International Ice Patrol (IIP), in 1912 ships relied on largely on information from others at sea. In early April 1912 a number of icebergs had been reported in the northwest Atlantic, which suggests it may have been an exceptional year for icebergs - although not a record. The IIP monitors icebergs by the number that drift south below the 48°N line called the I48N, which runs from Newfoundland to 40°W. This includes any iceberg greater than 16 feet (5m) in above-surface length. In 1912 1,038 icebergs are thought to have crossed the line - a large number, but not the most on record. In 2009, for example, over 1,200 icebergs were seen to cross the I48N. The iceberg which sank the Titanic was spotted just before midnight on 14 April 1912 and was 1,640 feet (500m) away. Pictured is one possible path taken by the iceberg that sank Titanic over 100 years ago . ‘The iceberg risk in 1912, in terms of number entering the northwest Atlantic shipping lanes, was therefore large, but not unprecedented,’ the authors write. Icebergs, however, generally lose most of their size while drifting south. It is thought that the Titanic iceberg was up to 605ft (185m) deep and about 410ft (125m) long, quite large for one so far south. The reason for this, the authors say, was because high pressure dominated the mid-latitude, central Atlantic atmosphere for several days in 1912. This led to winds carrying freezing air from northeastern Canada over the western Atlantic south of Newfoundland and, in turn, led to icebergs being transferred further south than normal for that time of year. Indeed, the distance south this particular iceberg travelled while maintaining the bulk of its size was largely unusual, despite being in a year with not a record number of icebergs. ‘Thus, two unfavourable factors had combined: there were a greater (though not exceptionally greater) number of icebergs than normal that year; and weather conditions had driven them further south, and earlier in the year, than was usual,’ the authors write. They add, however: ‘We may add a third: the stresses on the crew of the Titanic’s maiden voyage.’ After crashing into an iceberg, the ship that was described as 'unsinkable' went under in just two and a half hours leaving 1,517 people dead and only 700 survivors. Its wreck is pictured here .","Researchers say a combination of factors led to the sinking of the Titanic .

"By . Sophie Borland Health Reporter . Being obese or overweight heightens the risk of at least seven types of cancer, researchers say . More than 22,000 Britons suffer cancer every year because they are too fat, claim researchers. Being obese or overweight heightens the risk of at least seven types of the disease, including breast, bowel, pancreatic, womb, kidney, oesophagus and gall bladder. Academics from the World Cancer Research Fund say that excess fat is the second biggest cause of cancer after smoking. They have calculated that being overweight or obese is directly responsible for 22,138 cases every year. This toll includes 7,752 cases of breast cancer, 5,753 of the bowel and 2,978 affecting the womb. The figure is far higher than previous estimates, which have linked being obese or overweight to 17,000 cases annually. Last year just over 320,400 people were diagnosed with cancer, according to figures from Cancer Research UK. The latest calculations mean that 1 in 14 cases are caused by being overweight. Professor . Alan Jackson, chairman of the WCRF panel which calculated the figures, . said: ‘A significant number of cancer cases could be prevented by people . maintaining a healthy body weight. ‘Through . keeping levels of body fat low, a lot of people will avoid getting . cancer in the first place – forestalling the pain and anguish associated . with the disease.’ The . WCRF is carrying out an ongoing study looking at existing research to . try to estimate how many cancers are caused by people’s lifestyles. Risk: Almost two thirds of Britons are classified as being either overweight or obese . Academics . are particularly concerned at the number of cases of pancreatic cancer . caused by being overweight because it is so difficult to treat. Just under 8,400 Britons are diagnosed with this type of tumour every year and only 4 per cent are likely to survive. The . researchers estimate that 1,257 cases of pancreatic cancer a year are . caused by being overweight and are therefore preventable. Nearly two . thirds of Britons are classified as being either overweight or obese. Obesity is defined as having a body mass index above 30, while someone is classified as overweight if it is over 25. This figure is essentially an estimate of body fat and takes into account a person’s weight compared with their height. Last year, a study found that 134,000 cases of cancer could be prevented every year through simple lifestyle changes. Smoking was found to be the biggest cause and was responsible for 61,000 cases last year, according to academics from Oxford University. But they calculated that obesity was linked to only 17,000 cases of cancer. They admitted their calculations were probably ‘conservative’ however and it is likely that excess fat triggers many different types of cancer. People who are overweight or obese are increasing their risk of being diagnosed with cancer, scientists have warned . At the time, Dr Rachel Thompson, of the WCRF, said: ‘We hope this helps to raise awareness that cancer is not simply a question of fate and that people can make changes today that can reduce their risk. ‘Thousands of cases of cancer in the UK could be prevented by maintaining a healthy weight, being regularly physically active and eating a plant-based diet without too much salt, alcohol or red and processed meat.’ The WCRF has previously warned that the number of Britons diagnosed with cancer will double by 2050 unless urgent action is taken to stem the rising tide of obesity. It is thought that high levels of fat can ‘feed’ cancer by disrupting the body’s delicate balance of hormones. For example, the female sex hormone oestrogen is known to fuel breast cancer. Fat stored around the waist is particularly dangerous and is strongly linked to bowel cancer. It is predicted that, if nothing is done to tackle obesity, around half of men in England will be obese by 2040 with women not far behind.","Academics have said thousands of Britons are being diagnosed with cancer as result of being too fat .

"By . Daniel Mills for Daily Mail Australia . Mark Myles will face court for allegedly underpaying staff at his childcare centre . A school principal who ran a childcare centre in two Sydney suburbs has been accused of paying employees as little as $2.15 an hour. The Fairwork Ombudsman is alleging Mark Myles allegedly underpaid 16 staff a combined $362,000 over a five year period at  Bollygum Childcare Centres based at Penrith and Lethbridge Park in Sydney's western suburbs. The workplace regulator alleges one staff member was paid just $2.15 an hour, while others received between $3.31 and $3.98 before it went into liquidation last year. The legal, award wages for childcare workers are more than three times higher at between $17.25 and $19.64 an hour. A spokesman for United Voice, the union which represents childcare workers in NSW, said if the claims were accurate  they would constitute the most  severe breach of underpayments he has seen. 'Underpayment is fairly common but this is an extreme case - we are talking pretty gross underpayments,' he said. Mr Myles is now facing court over the payments he allegedly made to vulnerable, young staff at the centre which moved from Penrith to Lethbridge Park. Daily Mail Australia has attempted to contact Mr Myles over the allegations without success. The Bollygum Childcare Centre at Penrith and Letheridge Park went into liquidation last year and is now under new operators . Mr McElrea claims the standard hourly rate for an unqualified staff member - who he believes many of the workers would have been - is $17.25 an hour. 'For someone with a certificate III qualification it is $19.64.' In a statement of claim filed in the Federal Circuit Court The Ombudsman alleges a woman, aged in her early 20s, was underpaid close to $50,000 less than she was entitled to over four years. Another allegedly had her rostered hours reduced after she complained to The Ombudsman about her working conditions. The claims state that seven of the 16 staff were aged under 21 at the time of the alleged breaches - between 2008 and 2013. Employees were allegedly paid flat hourly rates, which did not cover minimum hourly rates, casual loadings, overtime rates, annual leave entitlements or a laundry allowance. The pay rates varied significantly between staff - with some being paid substantially above their lawful minimum entitlements for some work. Mr Myles faces maximum penalties of between $3300 and $10,200 per breach. The alleged underpayments were made between 2008 and 2013 the year the centre went into liquidation . The Bollygum Childcare Centre, which was based at South Penrith before it moved to Lethbridge Park, in Sydney's far western suburbs, went into liquidation last year preventing legal action against the company. The NSW Department of Education intervened this year when parents complained that the centre was without power for two days alleging children went without fresh milk and heating,'The Sydney Morning Herald reported. A Department of Education and Communities spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that Mr Myles' position as Winmalee Public School principal is unrelated to the allegations. 'This matter does not relate to the person’s role as principal,' he said. Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the court action is a response to a number of factors surrounding the case, including the large amount of money said to be owing and the involvement of 'vulnerable, young workers.' Ms James says the workplace regulator will pursue the court action based on the claim that Mr Myles was well informed of his obligations as an employer, but failed to ensure his business was compliant. Mr McElrea agreed that as the director of the business there is no way that Mr Myles would not have known his workers were being underpaid. The Fair Work Ombudsman will seek a Court Order for any penalty to be paid to the employees to partially rectify the alleged underpayments.","Mark Myles will face court for allegedly underpaying staff at Sydney centre .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . A trail aiming to provide a more sustainable source of omega-3 for both fish and humans is nearing completion. The groundbreaking research is aiming to produce genetically modified (GM) crops that are high in the oil usually found in oily fish, such as mackerel. The crops could help to alleviate pressure on the growing problem of strained fish stocks around the world and provide a more efficient source of omega-3. A trial in Hertfordshire was genetically modified crops to produce Omega-3 (shown). It is the first time plants grown outside have been made to produce fish oil . The trial is the first of its kind designed to provide a more sustainable source of omega-3. Taking place at Rothamsted Research in Hertfordshire the scientists have been growing a plant known as Camelina sativa that was genetically modified to produce long chain omega-3 fatty acids. These have proven health benefits for humans, but the methods through which they are currently obtained are unsustainable. The field trial gained approval in April from the UK’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). The experiment is important because it provides an alternative source of omega-3 . Fish gain their omega-3 from marine algae in the ocean but, when they are grown in fish farms, they need to be fed other fish in order to gain access to the oil. But fish docks around the world are in decline, with 80 per cent of fish taken from the ocean used in fish farming. ‘What we were trying to do was provide a sustainable source of fish oils,’ explains the lead scientist on the trial Professor Johnathan Napier to MailOnline. ‘Everybody knows that fish oils are a real benefit for human health and nutrition, I think the evidence for that is really clear.’ Professor Napier also pointed out that the risk of cross-pollination is low, because Camellia does not cross-pollinate with other oilseed crops such as oilseed rape or linseed. 'So gene-flow via cross pollination is a very low to negligible,' he explains. 'The netting around the trial was more to reduce the risk of GM pollen from our trial being picked up by bees and incorporated into pollen. 'The netting was of a mesh size to exclude pollinators like bees.' The Camelina sativa crops will be harvested at the end of the month to see how they have done. They could provide a more sustainable source of Omega-3 in the future . Professor Napier explains how they have been working on this for more than a decade, but this particular trial only began earlier this year. Previously plants have been genetically modified to produce omega-3 but only in enclosed greenhouses. This trial was the first of its kind outdoors that could mean plants are grown in regular fields in future to produce omega-3. The team hopes to harvest this batch of crops by the end of this month, depending on the weather, and they will then analyse the seeds to see how well they’ve performed. They will be hoping that the oil content is the same that they have seen in greenhouses, which would mean ‘this omega-3 trait could be stable in the field and could be used as a plant-based source of fish’ according to Professor Napier. He explains that one of the primary benefits of the research is that it will provide an alternative fish oil for fish farming, but he also imagines such crops could one day be sold to consumers on shop shelves. And if it does prove successful, he expects these GM crops could be widely grown in North America and Canada. ‘We’re trying to provide a solution to a global problem so where you grow it isn’t too problematic,’ he adds. Omega-3 has been shown to have various health benefits but access to it is difficult as it is usually only found in fish oil. 80 per cent of fish taken from the ocean (stock image shown) are used in fish farming . This particular trial hasn’t experienced some of the protests that accompanied previous trials at the field, which required increased security measures, but there has still been some opposition. Louise Payton, Soil Association policy officer commented: 'These GM plants have had more genetic modification done to them than most other GM plants that you see out there - this potentially increases the risks that the tweaking of genes has resulted in unintended adverse effects. 'And field trials always run the risk of plants or seeds escaping, making this GM experiment very risky. 'There are examples to prove this. For example only last year, an Oregon farmer found GM wheat contaminating their field - wheat that had only ever been grown in US experimental field trials (and therefore not approved for sale). 'How this contamination occurred still remains a mystery - particularly as the field trials had been stopped 12 years ago. 'And a few years ago, US farmers found all their long-grain rice was contaminated by a GM rice strain never authorised for commercial growing, resulting in farmers losing millions of dollars’ worth of sales.' And Liz O’Neill, Director of GM Freeze, told MailOnline: ‘Professor Napier tells us that this is the most sophisticated GM experiment anywhere in the world but the genes were added using the old-school agrobacterium technique which is more “pick up and chuck in vaguely the right direction” than “cut and paste” so there’s plenty of cause for concern. '‘One also has to wonder why we are investing public money in such a high-tech option when conventional plant breeding programmes have produced two crops with similar qualities.’ However, Professor Napier counters: ‘Agrobacterium is a natural bacteria, it’s nature’s genetic engineer. I can’t see why it’s a bad thing. ‘This research is all about providing solutions to a problem. ‘If you point out problems, you need to provide solutions.’","A trial in Hertfordshire was set up to create GM crops to produce omega-3 .

"By . Sam Webb for MailOnline . A man has been caught on video throwing himself from a 65ft cliff and landing painfully on his stomach in the water - just inches from the jagged rocks below. The thrill-seeker was caught on video hurling himself into the water below a harbour wall in Plymouth, Devon - at the same spot where one victim has already been paralysed in a similar stunt. The footage shows the man soaring chest-first through the air before hitting the water face down just a few feet from the stones. A second man looks poised to jump from the same concrete ledge - but decides against it after wincing at the huge crash his friend makes as he slams into the sea. The video was filmed by bystanders along Plymouth Hoe in Devon, with one shouting 'oh my god' and another heard to say: 'That one's going to die'. Scroll down for video . Dizzying: The man takes a run-up and throws himself from the harbour wall, with the rocks looming 65ft below him... ... and crashes into the sea flat on his belly, barely clearing the rocks below. Police have warned about the dangers of high-risk plunges into the sea . It was posted on YouTube and is of the tombstoning craze - the fast-growing craze for jumping into water from cliffs, piers and other structures. The name is said to come from the aim of entering the water upright and straight, like a tombstone, but has become a more general term for all high-risk plunges. The man leapt from the harbour wall just yards from where a teen tombstoner was left paralysed and wheelchair-bound in 2010. Ben Thompson, 17, broke his neck after leaping off an 8ft ledge but landing on rocks. Police, MPs and Coastguards have all warned teenagers about the dangers of tombstoning off cliffs, piers and other structures. It is not illegal but Devon and Cornwall Police have branded it a 'potentially lethal pursuit.' Ben Thompson from Plymouth, Devon, who was left paralysed after breaking his neck. He will spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair because of one leap from Plymouth Hoe into shallow waters. Right, a montage taken last year shows the stages of the terrifying craze of jumping 65ft off the sea wall into 'Dead Man's Cove' The force issued a warning saying: 'This is a reckless activity and even in calmer waters it can be extremely dangerous. 'We, along with the Coastguard, are trying to deter young people from this potentially lethal pursuit and we strongly advise against it. 'It may seem like fun but people are gambling with their lives against the power of the sea by jumping into unknown waters. 'It is unfortunately the case that if they carry on they are likely to end up with serious, life-changing injury or even death. This risk-taking behaviour is just not worth it.' The UK's first known fatality was Stephen Royston, 24, who jumped 100ft into a water-filled quarry at Kit Hill, Cornwall, in 2003.","The thrill-seeker was recorded plunging from a 65ft harbour wall in Plymouth .

"By . Steph Cockroft for MailOnline . A military buff who owns 20,000 toy soldiers and 600 model aircrafts in what is believed to be one of Britain's largest collections of Second World War memorabilia wants to open a museum - because his wife says the house has become 'too full'. Paul Andrassy, 59, has spent nearly 50 years amassing the £70,000 hoard, which includes 700 model military vehicles, 40 real and de-activated guns, grenades, badges, and even a reproduction flame thrower. But now his wife Zoe, 48, whom he married last year in a 1940s-style ceremony - complete with a guard of honour - said he needs to remove the collection from their home in Sheffield. Paul Andrassy, 59, has spent nearly 50 years amassing one of Britain's biggest collection of Second World War memorabilia at his home in Sheffield . But the Second World War buff, pictured above in a U.S uniform, is now looking to open a museum to house the collection, after his wife Zoe said the house was 'too full' His stash - which includes three bazookas and 13 full sized mannequins dressed in various uniforms - has become so big that she cannot even draw the curtains in their sitting room. She said: 'I don't really mind it that much. My dad was the same, he was a squadron leader in the RAF and he had lots of wartime memorabilia too, but he had to keep his in the loft. 'But the house is getting too full now. I would like to have enough room be able to draw the curtains in the sitting room.' Mr Andrassy, who has seven children, first began collecting the memorabilia when he was aged 10. His family collected tokens from boxes of washing powder Oxydol and sent off for free toy soldiers. He soon began making models and eventually expanded his passion until he owned everything from webbing and ammunition to flags and badges. He said: 'I started collecting when I was ten when my family would collect tokens from Oxydol (washing powder of the day) boxes and send off for free toy soldiers. His £70,000 hoard, which started with free toys from washing powder, includes 600 model aircraft hanging from the ceiling, pictured left, 700 model military vehicles, 40 real and de-activated guns, grenades, webbing, ammunition, flags, badges hours of battlefield film footage and life-sized mannequins, pictured right . 'Then I started making models and I have always been fascinated by the second world war. Once you get through the Frog and Airfix models you have to start looking abroad for new stuff, I got a lot from Russia.' Now, at the couple's semi-detached house, model aircraft hangs from every ceiling in the house, while walls are papered in wartime propaganda posters, pictures and newspaper cuttings. Mr Andrassy also has hours and hours of battlefield footage. He said: 'I admit it's is getting a bit full now. I don't want to glorify war and all that went with it but its history and its my hobby. What I would like to do now is to get together with some like-minded people and create a museum in Sheffield. Mr Andrassy married his wife Zoe last year wearing full 1940s gear, complete with a cheering crowd and a guard of honour . 'If a group of us with similar interests could find each other we could perhaps apply for lottery funding and put all the stuff under one roof where people could go and see it. I think a lot of people would find it fascinating.' Mr Andrassy, a butcher, put a note in the paper shop window near his work asking for Second World War memorabilia for the museum. He said people now bring in items all the time. He added that the recent upsurge in interest in both of the world wars means a surge in the price of memorabilia, raising the estimate of his collection to around £70,000 - although he said he would never sell it. Mr Andrassy said he was unable to give exact amounts for the different categories of his collection because he had 'lots and lots of everything'. He said he has hundreds of posters, cuttings and pictures, as well as 13 mannequins in full uniform, including two U.S paratroopers of the 101st Airborne, a British Engineer, a Desert Rat, a German paratrooper and an SS uniform. He also seven German soldiers uniforms waiting to go on display. Mr Andrassy said the German machine guns in his collection would be some of the priciest items at a cost of around £1,400 each. At his semi-detached house, model aircraft hangs from every ceiling in the house while the walls are papered in wartime propaganda posters, pictures and newspaper cuttings . Mr Andrassy believes his vast collection would be worth up to £70,000 but says he has no intention of ever selling his memorabilia . But there are still some things which he has not managed to collect, including a blank-firing German machine gun . He added that the Russian machine guns are are also expensive but many of his items are increasing in value as they get rarer. From the allied side, he has British Lee Enfield rifles and Bren guns. He has collected a U.S 'Grease Gun', Thompson machine guns and carbines. He also has Russian small arms in the collection. From the German side he has rifles, Schmeisser machine guns and heavy machine guns. The war buff, whose father was an RAF pilot, and his friends are also involved in the re-enactment of famous Second World War battles. Mr Andrassy is also enrolled in the 82nd US Airborn division. He said: 'We go all over the place and have a great time recreating the battles. We love it and the crowds love it - and everyone knows who's going to win. We have SS uniforms and we dress in those at appropriate meetings but not everywhere allows them. 'In Germany they are not allowed to do any re-enactment of the war and German people who are into it come over here to do it. 'One time we went to a re-enactment day in Scarborough in SS uniforms and someone came quietly up to us and told us we would not be allowed in wearing them. We didn't know that but we knew that some places dont allow them. It wasnt a problem.' Despite his huge collections, there are still some items that the fanatic has not managed to source. He said: 'A blank-firing German machine gun is something that everyone wants, they are so beautifully made and you should hear the sound of one. 'I would love a Willys Jeep but they cost a fortune. One bloke who is in to re-enactment group has bought one and he's restoring it but I don't think I'll ever be able to have one of those. Hopefully with a museum we can look at bigger items because I just don't have the room.'","Paul Andrassy, 59, from Sheffield, started collecting free toys from washing powder - and now has a £70,000 hoard .

"By . Australian Associated Press . Robert Xie is accused of killing two children, their parents, and their aunt at their home in northwest Sydney in 2009 . Accused murderer Robert Xie has 'a human face, but animal's heart', the Lin family matriarch says. 'I used to think he had higher education and could not be that bad. Now I see him as a monster.' Feng Qin Zhu made the comments during another emotional day of evidence at the Supreme Court trial of her son-in-law Xie. The crown says Xie was driven by bitterness when he crept into her son Min 'Norman' Lin's North Epping home in Sydney's northwest in the early hours of July 18, 2009. Using a hammer-like weapon, Xie is alleged to have murdered his brother-in-law Mr Lin, 45, Mr Lin's wife, Yun 'Lily' Li Lin, 44, their young sons Henry and Terry, and Lily's sister, Yun Bin 'Irene' Lin, 39. Xie, who has pleaded not guilty, faced trial earlier this year but it was cut short. He now is the midst of a retrial. Crown prosecutor Mark Tedeschi QC asked Mrs Zhu what information she 'found out' between these two trials. During another day of evidence at the Supreme Court trial of her son-in-law, the Lin family matriarch, Feng Qin Zhu said 'this person with a human face but animal's heart' Yun Bin 'Irene' Yin (left) was staying with her sister Lily (right) and Lily's husband Min when they and Irene's nephews Terry, 9, and Henry, 12, were bludgeoned to death with a hammer-like object . 'It was about Robert. This person with a human face but animal's heart,' Mrs Zhu cried. In the year before the killings, the crown alleges Xie had engaged in 'inappropriate sexual behaviour' toward a young female relative, who cannot be named for legal reasons. After the murders, the 50-year-old allegedly began sexually abusing her regularly. Mrs Zhu said she used to think Xie, who is married to her daughter Kathy Lin wasn't 'that bad' but after the sexual assault allegations were 'exposed' she now views him as a 'monster'. Referring to a Chinese proverb, Mrs Zhu said her daughter Kathy was a 'fresh flower'. 'In contrast Robert was the ox s***,' she told the court on Thursday. The trial continues. Yang Fei Li, the patriarch of the family, told the court he was meant to take his grandson Henry shopping on the day of their deaths .

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . A mother-of-two is so allergic to being pregnant she developed a rash so itchy she was driven to scratch her body until it bled. Claire Carter, from Preston in Lancashire, was diagnosed with the rare condition intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, also known as ICP, while she was expecting her two daughters. The 30-year'old's body was tricked into treating her pregnancy as though it was a foreign body, prompting what appeared to be an allergic reaction. The itching sensation became so intense, Miss Carter would wake in the middle of the night, just to scratch - even resorting to using a fork to relieve the irritation. Claire Carter, from Preston in Lancashire, was diagnosed with a rare condition while pregnant with her daughters Phoebe, left, and Penny, right . The condition - intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) - caused the now 30-year-old to come out in a rash left, leaving her suffering an unbearbale itching sensation during both pregnancies . But despite her extreme reaction to carrying a baby, Miss Carter recently gave birth to her second daughter, Penny. She said: 'I was so happy when I found I was pregnant but the nausea became so intense and I was itching more and more. 'I couldn't control the urge to itch and it became so extreme that I would make myself bleed sometimes. 'I threw up hundreds of times during each pregnancy. 'I used to joke that I was supposed to be glowing but instead I was asking my fiancé Richard to hold my hands down to stop me itching. 'Despite the pain and unbearable symptoms I have gone on to have two beautiful little girls Phoebe and Penny. 'They were worth every second of discomfort.' Miss Carter suffered from a rare condition during her pregnancies called intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, also known as ICP. ICP is a liver disorder  which affects the flow of bile and in extreme cases can cause still births. The sales advisor said: 'I'm so lucky both my girls were okay and I count my blessings every day. 'My mum and even the midwife thought my extreme bouts of sickness were completely normal and just my hormones kicking in. 'Luckily by the time I was 20 week pregnant with Phoebe the sickness died down but unfortunately it was replaced with something much worse.' Miss Carter, pictured with her daughters and fiance Richard and their daughters, said: 'I couldn't control the urge to itch and it became so extreme that I would make myself bleed sometimes. I threw up hundreds of times during each pregnancy' Miss Carter first noticed the condition when she was 20 weeks pregnant with her first daughter, Phoebe, pictured right. Pictured left is Penny, who was born recently . The mother-of-two began to feel an itching sensation - it was so uncomfortable that she'd use knives and forks to scratch with. She said: 'The itch was unbearably intense and the scratching burned. Jenny Chambers, Founder of ICP Support said: 'ICP affects around 5,500 women each year in the UK. 'The main symptom is scratching that can be severe or mild and the symptoms may include dark urine and pale stools. 'Sometimes women can also feel unwell but others will feel perfectly healthy, a part from the itch. 'We're delighted that all went for Claire after she got in touch with us and thankfully both her girls were born safely. 'However for other mums this year the outcome has not been so fortunate so it's vital that women report their itching. 'We recommend that if you are pregnant and itching you contact your health professional who can order very simple blood tests to screen for ICP.' 'When I was 30 week gone I decided enough was enough and my midwife advised I went to hospital. 'I went to the Royal Preston Hospital and was given a scan and blood test. 'Just a few days later my consultant phoned me and explained that I had ICP. 'Apparently my liver wasn't coping with the rise in pregnancy hormones so it wasn't keeping the bile acids. 'The bile acids are necessary for digestion but which are toxic, at low enough levels in my body. 'I was terrified when I was told ICP can cause premature births and even worse still births.' Miss Carter was put on medication to ease the itching and try and reduce the bile acid levels.'It was such a scary time, me and Richard worried so much for the baby, every check-up was nerve-racking. 'Three weeks later I went in for a scan and the consultant was worried as the baby has stopped growing,' she said. 'So just one week later on Boxing Day I was induced and 26 hours later our beautiful little girl was finally with us. 'Our little Phoebe weighed a tiny 4lb 8oz but thankfully she was perfectly healthy. 'Incredibly just a week after I'd given birth the ICP symptoms began to fade and my life got back to normal again. Miss Carter, said her symptoms disappeared after giving birth to both her daughters. She added: 'I know I'm incredibly lucky, I suffered from ICP and many women lose their babies because of it' 'I have since gone on to have another little girl, Penny. 'Even though I had the same symptoms as before, they were even worse and more intense this time and I was induced at 34 weeks. 'I was put on medication at diagnosis at 25 weeks which took the edge off the itching and made the burning sensation bearable though. 'I have also been in touch with ICP Support, an amazing charity who I can't thank enough. 'I know I'm incredibly lucky, I suffered from ICP and many women lose their babies because of it. 'I have the most amazing family and thankfully my two girls are blossoming every day.'","Claire Carter from Preston suffered intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy .

In a hearing on Thursday, Magistrate Greg Grogin told Central Local Court that CCTV footage ""seems to show there were some words spoken"" outside the pub. A scuffle then broke out between Lambaditis and Mr Heward, sparking Mr Rodrigues's involvement, he said. Moments later, the Brazilian national was knocked to the ground. When Lambaditis was later asked by police why he struck Mr Rodrigues, he allegedly told them: ""the only reason I punched him is because he was attacking me."" ""I dare say he (Rodrigues) was defending his friend,"" Lambaditis said, adding later: ""I just wanted to get out of there without getting hurt."" Lambaditis's lawyers were seeking to cross examine Mr Heward about the altercation at a pre-trial hearing. But Mr Grogin rejected their application saying Mr Heward told police he didn't remember anything about the alleged attack. ""The CCTV is extremely clear.

"By . John Stevens for the Daily Mail . Britain could face a eurozone-style currency crisis if Scotland votes for independence, leading bankers have warned. Goldman Sachs said a Yes vote 'could have severe consequences' for both Scotland and the rest of the UK. It cited the rush to withdraw money from Greece and Spain, which led to economic turmoil and mass unemployment. Goldman Sachs has warned of the 'severe consequences' for both Scotland and the rest of the UK if voters back independence on September 18 . Kevin Daly, a senior economist at the firm, said the Bank of England could be forced to use taxpayers' money to prop up the pound within hours of a Yes vote. Even this would not prevent 'negative consequences', he added. The prospect of Scottish independence saw sterling approach a five-month low this week, after polls showed the No campaign's lead had dropped significantly. Ed Miliband will today become the latest high-profile Westminster politician aiming to shore up the pro-union vote. He will tell Scottish voters not to use their referendum to rid themselves of the Tory-led government because he says he'll win the general election. The Labour leader will claim the Conservatives are 'on their way out' in an attempt to persuade his party's traditional voters to reject independence. SNP leader Alex Salmond, who visited Brownings Bakers bakery in Kilmarnock yesterday, has seen a surge in support for independence . The latest opinion polls show up to 30 per cent of Labour's natural supporters may be ready to switch allegiance and back Alex Salmond's plan to break up Britain. Many are thought to have been wooed by the SNP's message that a vote for independence would mean Scotland would no longer be ruled by English Tory ministers sitting in Westminster. Now, in a speech at Blantyre in South Lanarkshire, Mr Miliband will make a series of pledges in a bid to shore up the No vote. The tone of the speech is in marked contrast to the pro-union campaign so far, which has seen the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats working closely together. It is understood the new tactic was signed off by Tory strategists within the Better Together campaign. Winning over undecided Scots in Labour heartlands such as Glasgow is seen as crucial to reviving the No campaign, which has seen its lead slip from 22 percentage points to just six in one month. Mr Miliband will say that 'as Prime Minister' in eight months' time he will tax bankers' bonuses, raise the minimum wage, introduce a new higher rate of tax and abolish the so-called bedroom tax. 'The SNP want to tell you we can't defeat the Tories. They are wrong,' he will say. 'Change is coming in the UK - the Tories are on their way out. They are losing their MPs, they are defecting, divided and downhearted. 'A Labour government is within our grasp. With that election in just eight months' time the change Scotland needs is on its way. Electing a Labour government is the way to change Scotland.' He will claim: 'We will abolish the bedroom tax. Abolish it in Dundee, in Glasgow, but also in Carlisle, Newcastle and Nottingham.' Mr Miliband, David Cameron and Nick Clegg were accused of complacency at Prime Minister's Questions yesterday, as the main parties were urged to 'drop everything' and fight for a No vote. The latest YouGov poll shows a sharp narrowing in the lead for the No campaign ahead of the independence referendum on September 18 . Tory MP Sir Edward Leigh said: 'If we were to lose the Union, it would be not only a disaster for Scotland, but a national humiliation of catastrophic proportions.' Mr Cameron replied: 'The leaders of the parties in this House have all put aside their differences and said that, in spite of the political differences we have, we all agree about one thing: not only is Scotland better off inside the United Kingdom, but the United Kingdom is better off with Scotland inside it.' Of the 650 MPs in Westminster, 59 represent Scottish seats; Labour, which accounts for 41 of these, would be the hardest-hit by a Yes vote. Without Scotland, the Tories would have had a 21-seat majority at the 2010 election. The Scottish Nationalists' campaign has been boosted by two polls in the last week, which suggested 47 per cent of decided voters will back independence, compared with 53 per cent who will vote No. Mr Daly warned: 'Even if the sterling monetary union does not break up in the event of a Yes vote, the threat of a break-up would provide investors with a strong incentive to sell Scottish-based assets, and households with a strong incentive to withdraw deposits from Scottishbased banks. 'The most important specific risk, in our view, is that the uncertainty over whether an independent Scotland would be able to retain sterling as its currency could result in a [Europe-style] currency crisis occurring within the UK.'","Bank firm likens risk to withdraw money from Greece and Spain .

"By . Sean Poulter for the Daily Mail . Supermarkets are putting customers in danger by demanding price cuts from suppliers that effectively force them to commit fraud, a food safety expert has warned. And the situation has worsened since the horse meat scandal, according to Professor Chris Elliott, who was asked by the Government to investigate industry practices. He said the current high street price war means the pressure on suppliers is worse than in January last year, when it emerged that horse meat was being passed off as beef in supermarkets and fast food restaurants. The current price war means that pressure on suppliers is worse than in January last year, when it emerged that horse meat was being passed off as beef in supermarkets and fast food restaurants. ‘Procurement policies in some food businesses, particularly some of the larger retailers, are a matter of concern,’ he said. Prof Elliott’s review is highly critical of the supermarkets and suggests the Government and Food Standards Agency were slow to react to the scandal. The professor, who heads the Institute for Global Food Security, in Belfast, insisted that fraud is far more widespread than just consumers being fooled into eating horse meat. There has been evidence of cancer-risk chemicals being added to foods, peanuts used in place of other nuts creating the risk of serious allergic reaction, and dirty, condemned meat being sold for human consumption. A recent FSA survey of 145 lamb takeaway meals found 30 per cent contained other meat. One in five contained no lamb. The professor said the aggressive approach by the big supermarkets to their suppliers, sometimes demanding food at below the cost of production is opening the door to fraudsters, some of whom are resorting to threats and violence to cover up their activities. A recent FSA survey of 145 lamb takeaway meals found 30 per cent contained other meat. One in five contained no lamb. Above, file picture of lamb rogan josh . ‘The review has been presented with information about threats made by criminals to regulators inspecting food businesses, and by honest businesses trying to compete with cheats,’ he said. Prof Elliott has called for the establishment of a new Food Crime Unit with police powers to implement a zero-tolerance approach to fraud. None of the supermarkets, such as Tesco or Asda, brands such as Findus, or restaurant chains like Burger King have been prosecuted for selling horse meat dressed up as beef in burgers, lasagne, Bolognese sauce and other products.

"By . Louise Boyle for MailOnline . NBC is footing the bill for their $20million-a-year man Matt Lauer's helicopter jaunts to and from his Hamptons estate, it was claimed today. In an effort to keep the veteran Today anchor happy, network bosses are allegedly paying for Lauer to commute to his mansion in Long Island where he lives permanently with wife Annette and their three children. In June, Lauer signed a two-year extension on his annual $20million contract with Today, calling it 'the best job in broadcasting'. Matt Lauer and his wife Annette pictured on August 31 this year at the 39th Annual Hampton Classic Horse Show Grand Prix in Bridgehampton, New York. The Today host is said to chopper to and from his Hamptons home where he lives year-round . Lauer's popularity had waned following the messy departure in 2012 of co-host Ann Curry and speculation swirled that he may leave Today. But following a slide in ratings to rival morning show, Good Morning America, management believed that Lauer was key to Today's success - and along with the bumper pay-packet offered helicopter rides to sweeten the deal. An NBC source told Page Six: 'NBC News chiefs want to do everything to keep Matt happy. They believe ''Today'' has turned a corner and he is the key to its continuing success. They agreed to pay for his helicopter flights to the Hamptons and back, so he can spend more time with his family.' The source alleged that Lauer could be flying to and from the Hamptons up to three times a week from Manhattan heliports. High-flier: NBC confirmed on Thursday that Lauer sometimes commutes to his Hamptons home from the city by helicopter - but no word on who foots the bill for the average $1300 cost of each trip . Matt Lauer and son Jack arrive at East Hampton airport in July. The host commutes between his Hamptons' home where he lives with his ex-model wife and three kids and his Today show gig in Manhattan . The Today show confirmed to MailOnline today that Lauer did chopper out to his Hamptons home, reportedly worth $15million, where he also has a 40-acre horse farm. NBC is reportedly paying for Today host Matt Lauer's helicopter rides to and from the Hamptons . A Today show spokesman said: 'On rare occasion Matt will fly home, but most of the time you'll find him stuck in traffic on the Long Island Expressway with everyone else.' One charter company, Liberty Helicopters, revealed today that one seat on a five-seater helicopter from Manhattan to Southampton, Long Island, costs $1280 for a round trip. However no word from Today on whether Lauer or NBC foots the bill. The 56-year-old anchor has been with the Today show since 1994 making him the longest lasting host in U.S. daytime TV history. Lauer also keeps an apartment in Manhattan. His grueling schedule includes daily 4am wake-up calls for the morning show which is filmed in New York City's Rockefeller Center. In an interview with Hamptons magazine, Lauer told fellow NBC presenter Hoda Kotb that he had a 'painfully normal existence' in the exclusive resort taking riding lessons, walking the dog and watching his children compete in sports teams. But it has not all been domestic bliss for the Lauers. In 2006, and while pregnant with her third child, Annette, a former model, filed for divorce but they pair later reconciled. In 2010, gossip magazines reported that Matt was having an affair but the couple weathered the relationship storm.

The streets of an eastern Spanish town were awash with red pulp today, as thousands of people pelted each other with tomatoes during Tomatina, world's most famous food fight. At the annual fiesta in Bunol, trucks dumped 125 tonnes of ripe tomatoes for some 22,000 participants - many from abroad - to hurl at the hour-long morning festivities. Every year, the fiesta begins at around 10am with what's known as the palo jabon, in which brave revellers attempt to climb a greased pole to reach a ham, which has been placed at the top. Then a loud signal begins the onslaught of tomato madness. Tonnes and tonnes of especially grown tomatoes are thrown into the town's main plaza, where they're crushed, so as not to cause injury. The fight lasts an hour and covers the whole town square with red pulp. A large scale cleaning operation involving fire truck hoses ensues. This is the second year non-resident participants were charged to take part. The town of about 20,000 people began charging to help pay off debts of some 5.5 million euros (£4.3m). The event, which was sold out weeks ahead, was inspired by a food fight between local children in 1945 in the tomato-producing region. Scroll down for video .

"By . Amy Ziniak for Daily Mail Australia . A bizarre story of a young woman who was desperate to do her bit in Australia's war effort is just one of many stories being explored about the impact of war on Australian women. Teenager Maud Butler from the Hunter Valley coalfields caused quite a stir in 1915 when she cut her hair, dressed as a soldier and stowed away on a troopship to Egypt. ABC News reports, the adventurous life of 16 year old waitress, is being researched by historian Professor Victoria Haskins. Miss Maud Butler on the deck in AIF uniform, who tried to embark on the troop transport ship Star of England, and also on the ship Suevic. Maud had stowed away on the Suevic which sailed from Sydney on 23 December 1915, hoping to get to Egypt where her brother was serving. She arrived in Melbourne on 25 December 1915 . Maud Butler, a stowaway, dressed as a soldier, on deck prior to being transferred at sea from the troopship Suevic to the Blue Funnel liner Achilles. She is surrounded by ship's crew and soldiers looking on. Maud had stowed away on the Suevic which sailed from Sydney on 23 December 1915, hoping to get to Egypt where her brother was serving. She arrived in Melbourne on 25 December 1915 . As part of her study, Professor Haskins is researching Maud's expedition which includes her initial run in with authorities. The teenager from Kurri Kurri, rural New South Wales climbed on board a troopship waiting at the Woolloomooloo docks in Sydney at night. The clever young woman, who even looked the part, described how she got hold of an Australian Imperial Force uniform in bits and pieces and then had her portrait taken in it. On the day before she stowed away she went down to Woolloomooloo Bay and that's when she saw a barber to have her hair cut short. The next evening she headed back through the Domain to where the ship, Suevic, was lying at the wharf, a sentry on guard. 'Well, I said to myself, 'here goes for up the line'. It was a hand-over-hand job, and I didn't think the boats were so tall. I got up after a struggle and crawled to a lifeboat,' she told reporters from the Farmer and Settler. The war Maude wanted to get involved in : Australian World War I troops charging near a Turkish trench. When they got there, the Turks had retreated . 16 year old Maude Butler (pictured) wanted to do her bit for the Australian war effort so she dressed up as a solider, cut her hair short and stowed away on a troopship to Eygpt . It's believed she was close to getting away with it but it was her boots that gave it away and the 16 year old was discovered by a suspicious officer two days later out at sea, who asked for identification. 'That was the trouble all through. I bought the tunic and breeches from a soldier and the putties in George Street and the cap in Bathurst Street.' 'But I could get no regulation tan boots that I could wear. I tried everywhere, but it was of no use. So I had to chance it', reported ABC News. The officer, who hadn't worked out she was female, was going to let Maud stay but apon the request of a doctor's examination, she was forced to confess. She was then told by the captain she was going to put on the next passing passenger liner back home. 'Then I cried for the first time; it was hard luck, wasn't it, now'? Maud was reported as saying. 16 year old Maude Butler wanted to be a part of World War One.

Maud who was described as a 'rosy-cheeked,  healthy country girl' gave reporters an interview a few days after her return to Melbourne on Christmas Day, 1915. She told them that she 'had a terrible desire to help in some way'. With opportunities little, she also told of how in Sydney she had tried to join the Red Cross, without success. It's believed there were already hundreds of young women, both trained nurses and Red Cross voluntary aides, waiting to get the front. Studying Maud's extraordinary exploits, Professor Haskins has received a grant to explore the impact of the war on Australian women. 'The way I am approaching it is to reconstruct as much as possible the personal stories of individual women, like Maud Butler, whose stories can shed light on what it was like for women during the war from various backgrounds', she said.","Maud Butler, 16, cut her hair and dressed like a solider and snuck onto a troopship in 1915 .

Now the victim's heartbroken mum Carol has told her son's attackers to stop being 'cowards' and own up. Police say the attack is believed to have been sparked by an ongoing dispute between two teenage girls. Both girls allegedly arrived at the scene with a number of friends, including Mr Rajasurirar, who was hit from behind with a club or baton in Boolarong Avenue in the early hours of Tuesday. The gang then attacked the other four members of the unarmed group with bats and metal poles while continuing to beat an unconscious Mr Rajasurirar on the ground. 'His friends all love him. He'd do anything for his friends,' Ms Rajasurirar said. 'Who would do that to a person? I don't understand why.' 'Both parties please just do this (come forward) for James.'

"By . John Stevens And Alan Roden For The Daily Mail . David Cameron has insisted he will not resign if Scotland votes to quit the United Kingdom in two weeks’ time. The Prime Minister said it would ‘break my heart’ if the 307-year-old union were to end – but stressed it was ‘absolutely right’ to give Scottish  voters the chance to leave. The pro-union No campaign has seen its lead slip from 22 percentage points to just six in the past month. David Cameron, visiting a school in Wales, today insisted he will not resign if Scotland votes for independence, as Ed Miliband told Labour voters in Lanarkshire that the Tories are already on the way out . Sir Bob Geldof has urged Scotland to reject independence, saying nationalism is a ‘very dangerous political animal’. The Live Aid organiser added: ‘I know this – I’m Irish. It’s a cheap . political trick which twists the understanding of who we are. ‘I . understand the emotional impulse towards independence. But always . consider “independence” in inverted commas, because what the f*** does . it mean? We are entirely dependent on one another. None of us, in our . private lives or our political constructs, are ever independent.’ Last night it was rumoured that . nationalists have seen private polling data that puts them in the lead . for the first time in more than year. On a visit to Scotland yesterday, Mr . Miliband announced Labour would draft in party heavyweights including . Lord Prescott for a last-ditch campaigning blitz next week. Gordon Brown . will also appear in a joint rally with Mr Miliband. The Labour . leader, who has 41 MPs in Scottish seats, admitted he is under pressure . after polls showed that up to a third of his party’s supporters back . independence. Critics said he had only made a handful of visits north of . the border, despite a pledge earlier this summer that there was ‘no . bigger priority’ than keeping Scotland in the union. Appearing in . Blantyre, South Lanarkshire, where party founder Keir Hardie was born, . Mr  Miliband said: ‘I think for lots of people who have been here ... they have seen me many, many times in the last couple of months. I have . been here a lot. And I will continue to be here a lot. I’ve been a very . big and engaged part of this campaign.’ Mr Miliband used at the  Blantyre miners community resource centre in Scotland to make a series of pledges in a bid to shore up the No vote . The Labour leader urged voters not to think independence was the only way to 'get rid of this Tory government' Britain could face a eurozone-style currency crisis if Scotland votes for independence, leading bankers have warned. Goldman Sachs said a Yes vote 'could have severe consequences' for both Scotland and the rest of the UK. It cited the rush to withdraw money from Greece and Spain, which led to economic turmoil and mass unemployment. Kevin Daly, a senior economist at the firm, said the Bank of England could be forced to use taxpayers' money to prop up the pound within hours of a Yes vote. Even this would not prevent 'negative consequences', he added. The prospect of Scottish independence saw sterling approach a five-month low this week, after polls showed the No campaign's lead had dropped significantly. Mr Daly warned: 'Even if the sterling monetary union does not break up in the event of a Yes vote, the threat of a break-up would provide investors with a strong incentive to sell Scottish-based assets, and households with a strong incentive to withdraw deposits from Scottish-based banks. 'The most important specific risk, in our view, is that the uncertainty over whether an independent Scotland would be able to retain sterling as its currency could result in a [Europe-style] currency crisis occurring within the UK.' Last month, former Tory . leadership contender David Davis said a Yes vote would be such a . ‘humiliation’ to Mr Cameron that he would have to consider stepping . down. Michael Portillo has also claimed the Prime Minister would face . ‘tremendous pressure’ to leave Downing Street. However, Mr Cameron told Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘It’s very important to say no to that emphatically. ‘What’s . at stake here is not this prime minister or that prime minister, or . this party leader or that party leader ... what is at stake is the . future of Scotland. 'It’s a  desperately important question, I care . passionately about it. It would break my heart if Scotland were to leave . the United Kingdom.’ He said it had been ‘absolutely right’ to . agree to the referendum, adding: ‘Scotland voted for a Scottish National . Party whose policy was to hold a referendum. 'Now, if the British . Government, led by me, had said “you’re not having a referendum”, that . would have been a disastrous approach and would only have made Scottish . independence more likely.’ First Minister Alex Salmond, who . yesterday celebrated ten years in charge of the SNP for a second time, . said he would not step down if Scotland votes No. Asked if he would . hand the reins to his deputy Nicola Sturgeon, he said: ‘No, we’ll . continue to serve out the mandate we’ve been given and that applies to . me, it applies to all of us. 'But I don’t think there’s any reason to . expect we’ll be in that position – we’re far more likely to be seeing a . substantial and decisive Yes vote.’ Two City grandees have criticised Mr . Salmond for threatening to renege on Scotland’s share of UK debt if it . becomes  independent and is not allowed to keep the pound. First Minister Alex Salmond, touring Glasgow today, insisted Labour voters were turning their back on Westminster politics . Posing with Yes campaigners and Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon (right), Mr Salmond hailed the 'once-in-a-lifetime' opportunity of independence with polls showing he is on the up . During his campaign visit, Mr Salmond signed a sofa where voters have been posting messages about independence . Former . Bank of England deputy governor Sir Andrew Large and the former chairman . of Prudential Sir Martin Jacomb said: ‘The threat to walk away from . [Scotland’s] fair share of liabilities, an attempt to make reneging on . the debt seem like a good idea, is shabby and in no one’s interest. 'For . the rest of the UK it would leave a grudge, and would hardly be a . sensible place to start a new relationship.’ They described the . ‘apparent attraction’ of such a course as ‘illusory’, and argued it . would drive up borrowing costs for Scottish homeowners. ‘People . considering whether to lend to Scotland, or invest in its debt, would . remember the refusal to pay, and would want a higher interest rate to . compensate for the risk of repetition,’ they warned. The pair accused . Mr Salmond of ‘confusing the public’ with ‘inaccurate’, ‘untrue’ and . ‘distorted non sequiturs’ in an open letter to The Scotsman newspaper.

They argue that the carriage business provides a home for unwanted horses from the farming and racing industries.

"By . Michael Gadd For Mailonline . When it comes to having a high-brow night out London has higher prices than any other European city, according to a new survey. London is the most expensive city in Europe for cultural activities, even more costly that Paris for tickets to such attractions as ballet and opera, reveals the research from Post Office Travel Money. Even with some museums and art galleries being admission-free in London, overall the city still surpassed 11 of the continent's other major cities. For the survey the combined costs of a visit by two people was calculated for a museum, an art gallery, a heritage site, the ballet, the opera and a classical concert. High-brow, high-priced: Cultural experiences in London cost more than in other major European cities . The total for London was a whopping £256, with the most damaging elements being tickets for two to the Royal Ballet at £91 and opera setting a couple back £117.50. The best value cities were Warsaw in Poland, where the combined cultural trips cost just £70. The next destination kindest to the wallet was Budapest (£80) followed by Prague (£93) and Dublin (£102). A visit by a couple to the National Ballet in Budapest cost just £15, while the Polish National Opera in Warsaw was only £20. Despite the survey's findings, visitors are now in fact better off than they were in 2009 when a similar survey was conducted. The London cultural package then cost £326, more than 21% more than in 2014. Big night out: The combined costs of a visit by two people to a museum, an art gallery, a heritage site, the ballet, the opera and a classical concert was calculated to be £256 by Post Office Travel Money . Andrew Brown, of Post Office Travel Money, said: 'While every city surveyed boasts world-class cultural attractions, prices vary dramatically. This means culture vultures can save hundreds of pounds by doing their homework before booking and swapping expensive cities for cheaper ones.' Cultural costs in Rome (down 36.1%) and Vienna (down 27.3%) have fallen even more than those of London since 2009, while Amsterdam (up 37.3%) has experienced the highest rise.Gordon Innes, CEO of London & Partners, the Mayor’s promotional company, defended the city's budget-busting prices: 'Not only do we [London] have world-class attractions such as the Royal Opera House, the English National Ballet, and many superb theatres, but many of our museums and galleries are completely free. 'This means that people on any budget can experience some of the world's best collections of art and history at leading institutions such as the British Museum, Tate Modern, or the National History Museum – at no cost at all. He added: 'London's cultural offering is extremely competitive with that of cities such as Paris and New York, as shown by the record number of tourists that we continue to see coming here to enjoy what the city has to offer.'","Post Office Travel Money combined the costs for a couple to a museum, an art gallery, a heritage site, the ballet, the opera and a classical concert .

"By . Stephanie Linning for MailOnline . Tiya Chauhan died aged 22 months after choking on a cube of jelly during a play session at Dicky Birds nursery in Wimbledon, south London . Staff at a nursery where a toddler choked to death on a cube of jelly were found to be 'grossly negligent' by failing to provide appropriate care, a coroner has ruled. Tiya Chauhan, aged 22 months, fell unconscious during a ‘free flow’ play session at the Dicky Birds nursery in Wimbledon, south London. On the morning of Tiya's death in August 2012, . there were 11 members of staff working at the nursery, supervising 30 . children aged up to four years old, Westminster Coroner's Court heard. The rooms of the nursery were opened up allowing children of different groups to play in a 'free flow' session that encourages them to engage in a range of indoor and outdoor activities. One of the games was a sensory table that included cubes of jelly. But no one saw Tiya pick up the jelly or put it in her mouth, the court was told. Prashant Popat, representing Tiya's parents, Dipa and Chetan Chauhan, said: 'No adult in that nursery saw Tiya take jelly from the table. 'No adult saw or heard Tiya put jelly in her mouth. No adult saw or heard Tiya choke. 'If she coughed or struggled for breath or made noises, she was not seen or heard. No adult saw or heard Tiya fall to the ground. 'If children must be supervised at all times do you really think that there was adequate supervision?' The nursery staff argued there was adequate supervision and they had no way of knowing the jelly was a choking hazard. Today the jury delivered a verdict of 'accidental death with neglect' and said that the nursery staff had been 'grossly negligent' in supervising her. Her parents, who described their daughter as 'happy' and 'bubbly' wept as the verdict was read out. Coroner Fiona Wilcox said: 'The jury concluded there was a gross failure . on the part of the nursery to provide appropriate care for Tiya. 'There was inadequate communication between all staff which was a gross failure. Tiya's father Dipa and mother Chetan Chauhan, pictured court after an earlier hearing, described their daughter as 'bubbly' and 'happy' and wept as the verdict was delivered . 'There was a significant failure to carry out adequate risk assessments relating to the jelly cube. 'The jury has ruled her death was accidental contributed to by neglect.' The inquest previously heard claims the nursery’s operations manager Derek Hayes ‘deliberately minimised’ the incident in his formal report to Ofsted. He also admitted picking out a member of staff, Natasha Collins, at random and suspending her following the death. Mr Hayes said he had done so ‘because she had cold sores’ but Miss Collins ‘thought it was something to do with Tiya’s death’. Dr Wilcox told the jury: ‘He stated there was no logic to this suspension’. But Mr Hayes ‘specifically denied there had been a management cover-up of this incident’, Dr Wilcox added. The coroner recalled how the toddler’s parents were first told that ‘an unknown medical condition had not been ruled out as the cause of Tiya’s death’. Earlier, the inquest was told that a London Ambulance crew removed a piece of ‘jelly-like substance’ from Tiya’s airway. She was taken by ambulance to St George’s Hospital but died later the same day. The cause of death was asphyxiation caused by a foreign body. Speaking after the verdict, Mr Chauhan said: 'We feel very satisfied the jury reached the correct verdict. 'Nothing . we can say or do can bring back our beautiful daughter Tiya nor relieve . the pain of not seeing our little bundle of joy grow up with our . family. 'All our hopes and dreams for Tiya have been taken from us. 'This hearing, although hard to bear has helped us and we are grateful to the coroner for conducting a thorough inquest. Speaking after the verdict, Mr Chauhan said: 'Nothing we can say or do can bring back our beautiful daughter Tiya nor relieve the pain of not seeing our little bundle of joy grow up with our family' 'This has provided us with an opportunity to better understand the circumstances in which Tiya died.' But he said that unanswered questions remained following the inquest. He . added: 'The nursery has continued to deny any responsibility or . accountability for Tiya's death in the face of overwhelming evidence and . even to this day continue to blame the jelly. 'We are absolutely . disgusted by the behaviour of the nursery, they mislead Ofsted by . suspending a junior member of staff who had nothing to do with her . death. 'We hope Ofsted and Health and Safety fully investigate the matter. 'The . nursery has shown no compassion or remorse and the manner in which the . Dicky Birds Nursery has conducted itself has been regrettable and has . added considerably to our pain. 'Our aim has always been to establish . the truth of how Tiya died so that other nurseries and governing bodies . may learn by the mistakes made here. 'We believe the Inquest has gone some way to achieving that.' 'At the time we did not . appreciate how dangerous jelly play could be. Immediately after the . tragedy, we removed all free flow and food play from our nurseries' - Rachel Berry, owner of Dicky Birds Nurseries . Mr Chauhan told the hearing they had previously had concerns about the . nursery after their daughter had been twice bitten on the face, and they . had wanted to remove her from there. He added: 'She was loud, she was only 22 months, she was forming her personality. 'She would pull her brother off toys, push him away. 'She was bubbly, she was loved by everyone. She was an infectious child. 'If she ever saw someone she would go up to anybody, she wasn't afraid of anybody. She loved to get out.' Dicky Birds Nurseries is a family-owned business with other nurseries in Wimbledon, Raynes Park, New Malden and Surbiton. Rachel Berry, owner of Dicky Birds Nurseries, . said in a statement today: 'We would . like to express our deepest sympathies to Tiya’s family. 'For . the last 18 years we have always strived to provide the best possible . childcare by exceeding all of the national standards set by Ofsted and . other agencies including the quality of our buildings, resources, staff . ratios and training. 'During the . hearing the medical expert gave evidence that even a small piece of . jelly, in particular, if inhaled, could pose a silent and rapid . asphyxiation hazard, from which it is almost impossible to recover. 'In . 2012, as was nationally accepted best practice, we were operating free . flow play at set times in our nursery. One of these activities was a . sensory play table dressed with prehistoric animals in a spaghetti and . jelly swamp. 'At the time we did not . appreciate how dangerous jelly play could be. Immediately after the . tragedy, we removed all free flow and food play from our nurseries. 'Currently, . we know that food and jelly play remains prevalent in many nurseries . and we welcome that the coroner will be making a report regarding the . danger of raw jelly in childcare settings. 'We remain devastated that the tragedy of this day two years ago cannot be undone and our thoughts remain with Tiya’s family.'

"By . Emily Payne for MailOnline . A  cheeky cat that has been enjoying free run of a Scottish medieval castle for the last year is set to appear on Japanese TV. The fearless feline - named Kipper - spends his days prowling the grounds of Blackness Castle, near Linlithgow, roaming the battlements and leaping out of gun-holes at unsuspecting tourists. The five-year-old moggie has  become an online sensation with castle visitors frequently posting snaps of him perched on vantage points or nestling in comfy corners of the stone fortress. Kipper  roams the battlements almost every day and even leaping out of gun-holes at unsuspecting tourists . And Kipper is now set to appear on Japanese TV after a production crew spent eight hours filming him for a documentary about quirky cats from around the world. Dubbed World 'Cats' Travelogue, the programme was shot by wildlife photographer Mitsuaki Iwago - an award-winning filmmaker whose work has twice featured as cover stories on National Geographic. Kipper's owner, Ritchie Gilfillan, 31, who lives near the castle with wife Pamela and two-year-old son Callum, credited the cat's friendly attitude for his soaring popularity. He told how Kipper was adopted by the Gilfillans in 2010 after being found as a stray on the Isle of Skye. Mr Gilfillan said: 'It's quite crazy how popular he has become. Affectionate: Kipper has the 'personality of a dog', loves going for long walks and thinks he owns the castle . 'But he's a really affectionate little cat and he just loves attention. He loves going for walks along beside us - no matter how far you walk he will follow you.' Graeme Sinclair, monument manager at Blackness Castle, said Kipper has now become a valued member of the castle team. The 53-year-old said: 'He lives in the village, but he comes to the castle every day and has been roaming around for over a year now. 'He likes the tourists. 'He will meet a group that comes to the castle and they will wander around the grounds and down to the pier, and he will stay with them for the whole hour. Star: Kipper is set to appear on Japanese TV after a production crew spent eight hours filming him . 'People are amazed. He has the personality of a dog - and he'll think nothing of climbing into cars if people pull up. 'You'll see him flying out the gun-holes and running across the grass and jumping on to picnic tables. He gives off the impression he owns the castle. 'Maybe he is somehow the reincarnated life of someone who lived here.But he is part of the team here now. I play the bagpipes and he is even gradually becoming accustomed to that.' Mr Sinclair said staff at Blackness Castle insist the carefree cat is one of a kind. He added: 'I've certainly never heard of any other pets roaming around castles.' Blackness Castle was built in the 15th century when the area was the main port serving Linlithgow - a key base for the Scottish monarchy at the time. The historic fortification was briefly used as an ammunition depot during the First World War before passing into the care of Historic Scotland.","'Kipper' roams around Blackness Castle, near Linlithgow, West Lothian .

"By . Carol Driver . and James Rush . A woman whose husband died from lung cancer said she is still waiting for an apology from a holiday company after being told to 'take someone else with you' when she tried to cancel their Spanish anniversary trip. Chris Quick, 58, and her husband Keith, 61, of Southsea, had booked and paid for a trip to Benidorm last month to celebrate their 38th wedding anniversary. However, Keith was diagnosed with the terminal condition when he went to visit his GP in May, and his condition rapidly deteriorated. Mrs Quick, pictured with her husband Keith in May, has said she is still waiting for an apology from Thomson . Chris Quick (pictured on a previous holiday with her husband Keith) was told by a holiday company 'to take someone else with you' when she tried to cancel two holidays after her husband was diagnosed with lung cancer . They had also booked another trip in October to the Spanish resort, where they have friends. But when they told travel operator Thomson's Hilsea branch back in May that the two Benidorm breaks would have to be scrapped, the company warned not all the money would be refunded. They said Mrs Quick should find another travel companion. Mrs Quick, a retired support worker for a women’s refuge, told portsmouth.co.uk:‘It’s really appalling that they still haven’t sent a letter of apology. ‘I haven’t had the time to chase the company up on it because Keith went downhill very quickly, and my concern wasn’t about the travel operator at that time. ‘They did reimburse some money, but it’s not about that. It was about the way they spoke to my daughters when they called to cancel the holiday.' Mrs Quick said the couple (pictured on a previous holiday to Benidorm) go out to the destination about four times a year every year to see friends . Mrs Quick also claims one of her daughters was told to 'shut up' - and said she has not had an apology. Thomson have so far paid back £538 for the holiday in June, which cost £1,900. Refunds for the October holiday have still not been sorted out. Mr Quick told MailOnline in May, after her husband's diagnosis: ‘'I am so angry about this. It’s not about the money as we are sorting it with our insurance. 'I want an apology for the way we have been spoken to. This has been a very emotional time for us. 'When we got given this terrible news I told my daughter to ring Thomson to cancel the holiday for us.' Their daughter Kerry Holt, 36, called Thomson with the news in May and was warned that not all the money would be refunded. The couple had booked and paid for a trip to Benidorm next month to celebrate their 38th wedding anniversary (file picture) She said 'The attitude of the person on the phone was appalling - I was told to ""shut up"" at one point. 'There was no empathy to my dad’s situation. He didn’t want this to happen. 'Mum and dad have used Thomson for the past four years and thought they would show more compassion. 'Instead they suggested my mum should go on holiday with someone else.' MailOnline has contacted Thomson for a comment. According to Thomson's website, customers who have travel insurance with Thomson Insurance may be covered if they were unaware they had a condition at the time of booking. The company does say however the insurance does not cover those who knew there was a possibility they may have to cancel. In more general circumstances, the Citizens Advice Bureau says under package holiday regulations, customers 'only have the right to cancel if your organiser has made major changes to your holiday.' It goes on to say: 'If your organiser hasn’t made any changes to your holiday your right to cancel will depend on the terms and conditions of your holiday contract. You may be able to cancel your holiday but your organiser might charge you a cancellation fee. 'You will normally be able to find information about your organiser’s cancellation policy in your holiday brochure or with your booking information'. In May, a spokesman said: 'Thomson is very sorry to hear that Mr and Mrs Quick were unhappy with the service they received when cancelling their holiday. 'We sympathise with their situation and understand this must be a very difficult time. 'Our customer service and retail teams always aim to offer the best possible service to all customers and this includes providing them with details of all the options available to them. 'We would like to reassure the couple that we never intended to cause offence or undue upset by providing this information. 'As their holiday has now been cancelled we have advised Mr and Mrs Quick to contact their insurance provider to settle their claim.' In February this year, MailOnline reported on grandfather Bruce Crawcour who won a full refund from Thomson Holidays in a landmark case. Mr Crawcour, 66, launched his battle with parent company TUI Travel after he was forced to cancel a holiday when his wife Kay, 63, fell ill. Instead they charged him the full £2,256 for the two-week break the couple were due to have last May in Majorca at the luxury Protur Biomar Gran Hotel. But the retired civil servant managed to prove the company was not out of pocket after the flights and hotel room vanished from the Thomson website before the departure date. He argued this meant they had managed to sell the package on. In February, he became one of the first holidaymakers in the UK to be awarded damages from a tour operator for a cancelled holiday. The pensioner, who represented himself at Telford Small Claims Court, was awarded a full refund as well as £300 court costs. At the time it was reported the ruling could spell major changes for holidaymakers who follow suit and sue travel firms over cancellation clauses in package holiday contracts. Experts believed it may force tour operators to change their policies on late cancellation fees.","Chris and Keith Quick booked trip to Benidorm for wedding anniversary .
