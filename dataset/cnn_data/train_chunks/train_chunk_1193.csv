"A state owned TV channel in Romania has sparked outrage after broadcasting songs by a choir who sang anti-Semitic 'Christmas carols' which celebrate the burning of Jews. TVR3, which is ran by the Romanian government, broadcast the performance by a folk group from Cluj last week. As part of their set, they sang a carol which glorified the Holocaust and called for Jewish people to be burned in the chimney. Scroll down for video . Gathering: The choir, from Cluj, perform the offensive song in a rural setting on the state-owned TV station . Generations: Both old and young Romanians are part of the choir who sing the anti-Semitic lyrics . According to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, the broadcast aired on December 5 and reached many rural parts of the Eastern European country. The song rhymes and uses the word 'jidovi', a word Romanians use to describe Jews, and contains the lyrics 'only in the chimney as smoke, this is what the 'jidov' is good for', according to spiegel.de. Romania's Foreign Minister Titus Corlatean has publicly criticised the broadcast and has even called on prosecutors to take action against the channel. The Israeli embassy too has responded, saying they were 'concerned' about the show. In a statement, TVR said they were not responsible for the songs performed by the choir, insisting a selection was chosen by a local culture committee. A YouTube video of the performance shows the choir singing the offensive song before taking questions from a female host. She thanks the singers before asking about their choice of music and why it reflects the traditional Cluj culture in Romania. Anti-Semitism groups in Romania have condemned the broadcast saying it is unacceptable for the channel to evade responsibility by blaming a local organization. A musician plays along to the song, which is said to be an archaic folk carol sang at Christmas time . Backlash: TVR3 have been roundly criticized for allowing the song, which promotes the 'burning' of Jews, to be broadcast on state-run TV. Bosses at the station have since been sacked pending an investigation . According to the Jewish Telegraph Agency, a complaint has been sent to Romanian President Traian Basescu and Prime Minister Victor Ponta which reads: 'It is outrageous that members of the public weren't scandalized by an anti-Semitic song calling for people to burn Jews.' Bosses at TVR are already in the process of being replaced after previous unacceptable conduct. It's head Claudiu Saftoiu and the rest of the management have been removed from their posts.","Rural TV station broadcast 'Christmas' songs by local choir .

"America takes its ski destination names seriously. And one rebranding exercise saw a lawsuit between two popular ski areas in the US, after Salt Lake City, Utah, named itself Ski City USA. The name somewhat overshadowed Steamboat Springs, Colorado, which has long been known as Ski Town USA. The Great Debate: Visit Salt Lake attempted to introduce the moniker 'Ski City USA' but Steamboat Springs, Colorado, filed a lawsuit in response. Pictured: Salt Lake City, Utah . The 100-year-old town of Steamboat Springs has been known as 'Ski Town USA' since 1959 . Colorado's Steamboat Ski & Resort, which had been known as Ski Town since 1959, soon launched a federal lawsuit alleging a trademark violation. 'They are attempting to leverage our brand and our brand equity,' Steamboat's SVP of sales and marketing, Rob Perlman, was quoted as saying last month. Visit Salt Lake, however, argued that their winter marketing campaign, which cost approximately USD$1.8 million (£1.15 million), simply highlighted the differences between urban and rural ski destinations. 'Just as each ski town has its individual traits and attributes, Ski City USA is unique,' read a statement issued from Visit Salt Lake in October. Initially, tourism board, Visit Salt Lake protested the cease and desist. Pictured: Deer Valley ski resort, near Salt Lake City . The settlement was reached on November 14, with Visit Salt Lake agreeing to remove the 'USA' from the 'Ski City USA' promotional materials. Pictured: Steamboat Springs, Colorado . 'Ski City USA provides a distinct alternative to the ski town experience.' Further details of the settlement, which was reached on November 14, remain confidential but nevertheless, Visit Salt Lake has agreed to drop the 'USA' from the name, going by 'Ski City' instead. Steamboat Ski & Resort Corp. has, in return, dropped the lawsuit. 'Steamboat appreciates Visit Salt Lake's willingness to revise their campaign in order to address the concerns that resulted in a court filing,' explained Steamboat's SVP of sales and marketing, Rob Perlman. 'We are pleased to have resolved this matter amicably before the start of the winter season and I want to thank Visit Salt Lake for working with us so quickly.' 'Steamboat appreciates Visit Salt Lake's willingness to revise their campaign,' says a statement issued by Steamboat Ski & Resort Corp . Salt Lake City remains a premier ski destination, welcoming over 4.1 million skiers last season. Pictured: The St. Regis Hotel in Deer Valley . True to their word, Visit Salt Lake has amended its website, but insists that the campaign's aim remains the same. 'The Ski City campaign is unique and will continue to promote a distinct alternative experience - the benefits of an urban community teeming with restaurants, professional sports teams, cultural offerings and abundant hotel options,' Visit Salt Lake CEO Scott Beck said. 'Visit Salt Lake recognizes that towns like Steamboat Springs are iconic in what they offer to winter enthusiasts and is pleased to reach an agreement on this matter to further distinguish these two unique locations.' During the 2013 season, Salt Lake City and its surrounding ski hills hosted hosted 4.1 million skier visits.","Visit Salt Lake recently introduced 'Ski City USA' marketing campaign .

"New rules on school meals inspired by Michelle Obama were intended to wipe out hunger and malnutrition among American students - but some are complaining they have had the opposite effect. High schools are now forbidden from giving pupils more than 850 calories for their lunch - even if they are fast-growing teenagers or even student athletes. One enterprising group of adolescents channelled their anger at the policy into a parody YouTube video promoting their cause entitled 'We Are Hungry'. Scroll down to watch the video . Healthy: Michelle Obama visited a school in Virginia in January to promote new rules about students' meals, but now many are speaking out against the restrictions which have just come into force . Rebel: 16-year-old student athlete Callahan Grun stars in a YouTube video satirising the new rules . The new restrictions were mandated by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, signed into law during the lame-duck period of the last Congress in December 2010. As well as the calorie limits, the law requires students to be given more fruit and vegetables and cuts down on sweet and fatty foods. Now that the rules have come into effect for the new school year, many are concerned that some adolescents are being denied the quantities of food they need. Student athletes can burn through as many as 5,000 calories a day - but they are still entitled to no more than 850 calories for their lunch. Even though recommended calorie intake is different for males and females, the restrictions are the same for both boys and girls. Exhausted: As illustrated by this clip from 'We Are Hungry', many students do not have the energy for sports . Stash: Some are bringing in junk food from outside school and keeping it hidden away . In addition, because many children refuse to eat the fruit and veg they are required to accept, some are eating significantly less than the mandated 850 calories for high-schoolers, which goes to 650 for those in elementary school. One middle-schooler in South Dakota told KELOland: 'I know a lot of my friends who are just drinking a jug of milk for their lunch. And they are not getting a proper meal.' A school principal estimated that his cafeteria 'threw away four boxes of peaches' at the beginning of the year after seeing most students refuse to eat the fruit even when it was placed on their trays. The situation inspired Kansas high-school teacher Linda O'Connor to pen 'We Are Hungry', a video featuring her students complaining about the restrictions to the tune of hit single We Are Young by fun. Starring 16-year-old football player Callahan Grun, the video humorously portrays students' struggles to eat enough during the day to fuel them through a busy schedule of class and after-school sports. It shows them passing out in the classroom, on the football field and in the gym, and documents the length they go to to feel full - for example, sneaking out of school during break and stashing snacks in their lockers. Passed out: The video humorously exaggerates the effects smaller portion sizes have on student athletes . Obsessed: In the video, Callahan dreams of being given a filling meal by his mother . Brenda Kirkham, a colleague of Ms O'Connor at Wallace County High School in the farming town of Sharon Springs, told the Wichita Eagle she was outraged at seeing students go hungry thanks to government rules. 'Think of a high-school boy who works out at least three hours a day, not including farm work,' she said. 'I'm furious.' Some pupils have turned to radical solutions to get round the ban on sugary snacks - at one school, a black market has sprung up in chocolate syrup. Students at a high school in New Bedford, Massachusetts are bringing syrup into school and selling it to friends so they can make their own contraband chocolate milk, according to the Standard-Times. 'Flavored milk... I don't understand why we can't have that,' said 17-year-old Paige Lame. Another unintended consequence of the rule is that charity groups are unable to sell cookies or candy to raise money for good causes and student activities, thanks to a crackdown on the availability of junk food on school property. Put your back into it! Physical exercise is another cornerstone of the First Lady's fitness agenda . The government has defended the reforms, saying that students who are under-nourished should be encouraged to eat vegetables at home as well as in school. 'Many children aren't used to eating fruits and vegetables at home, much less at school,' said a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 'So it's a change in what they are eating. 'If they are still hungry, it's that they are not eating all the food that's being offered.' Even as the country as a whole becomes more health-conscious, the nutrition of school meals has long been a sore point for both children and their parents. When British chef Jamie Oliver went to Los Angeles in an attempt to repeat the success he had in the UK in reforming childhood nutrition, he was met with firm resistance by families reluctant to make any changes to their culinary routine.

"60 per cent of his primary pupils have Facebook access . A primary school head has threatened to shop parents to social services if they allow his pupils to use Facebook and other networking sites. Paul Woodward is concerned that youngsters who use the sites risk being exposed to porn and online grooming. He has warned parents that persistently letting children flout Facebook’s 13-plus age rule could warrant investigation by child protection teams. He estimates that at least 60 per cent of the 270-plus children at his school in the Forest of Dean have access to social networking sites. Pupils at St Whites School range from four to 11 years old. At risk: A primary school head has threatened to shop parents to social services if they allow his pupils to use Facebook and other networking sites . Mr Woodward, a branch secretary for the National Association of Head Teachers, the country’s biggest heads’ union, yesterday demanded a ban on children setting up social media accounts – because of the risk of accessing inappropriate material. Internet companies and the Government must do more to protect impressionable children, he said. Head teachers are also demanding greater protection from porn accessed through smartphones, as well as measures to stop young children playing 18-rated video games. Children as young as four are hurting each other, not realising their victims won’t get up straight away like figures in computer games do, it was claimed. The calls will add to pressure on David Cameron to bring in measures to protect a generation of youngsters. In a breakthrough for the Mail’s Block Online Porn campaign, which calls for content filter systems on online accounts, the Prime Minister this week revealed that adults who wish to view porn may have to ‘opt in’ rather than being able to access it by default. Yesterday Mr Woodward welcomed the move as a ‘good step forward’. But he added: ‘The real concern is children being able to have Facebook accounts when they are not old enough, and parents condoning it. If my school is representative, it’s 60 per cent at least have got access.’ He said he had had cases where he told parents: ‘It’s illegal for you to do this, you shouldn’t be doing it for your child. You need to close down that account or I might have to tell the safeguarding people that you are exposing your child to stuff that’s not suitable.’ Social networking: Paul Woodward is concerned that youngsters who use the sites risk being exposed to porn and online grooming . Mr Woodward added: ‘Children open themselves up to grooming, and then you don’t know what sort of content they could get hold of.’ Many parents lack awareness of the potential dangers to children from the variety of links and ‘apps’ that can be accessed through Facebook and other sites, he warned. As soon as his school becomes aware a child has a Facebook account it contacts the company to get the profile blocked. He spoke out as the NAHT gathers in Harrogate for its annual conference this weekend. He will propose calling on the Government to investigate misuse of social media. Other heads warned that abuse of technology was a ‘growing problem’ in schools. Kenny Frederick, a London head, said parents were buying smartphones on which children ‘can access pornography, anything’. John Killeen, a head from North Yorkshire, said pupils were copying behaviour they see in video games. Stephen Watkins, from Leeds, added: ‘Four-year-olds don’t understand if you hit someone over the head with a brick they’re not going to jump up immediately as they do on the screen.’ Helen Clegg, of North Tyneside, warned of ‘deplorable’ attacks on heads via Facebook. Facebook says there is nothing it can do to stop children under 13 setting up accounts, despite it being a breach of its own policy.",60 per cent of his primary pupils have Facebook access .
"A perfect gentleman from Kazakhstan will be in London on Wednesday shaking hands, smiling and exchanging courtesies not only in his own language but in English – and in German or Russian should citizens of those countries happen to be in the room. Do not be fooled, this is one of the most feared fighters in boxing today. Gennady Gennadyevich Golovkin knocks out opponents for fun, 28 of them in 31 bouts for a 90 per cent KO ratio, which is the highest in modern middleweight championship history. Gennady Golovkin throws a jab at Marco Antonio Rubio during his world title win in October . Higher, then, than Sugar Ray Robinson, Carlos Monzon, Sugar Ray Leonard and Marvin Hagler. No wonder most of the starrier names in the division have been ducking this man like the plague. To look at that happy, fresh face you might think you are in the company of a youngster in his graduate year at university. Do not be fooled. Golovkin is 32 and extremely wise in the ways of the world. Not least the boxing world which kept him waiting until he was almost 30 for his chance to win a world title. Since that explosive day only one of his challengers has survived longer than eight rounds and even he was gone two rounds later. No rival has come close to beating him in those 31 professional bouts. He has never been put down, let alone knocked out, in 375 fights as a world amateur champion and in the paid ring. Golovkin throws another big left at Rubio during his knockout victory over the Mexican . The Kazakh takes a bow after winning against Rubio inside two rounds to extend his stoppage streak . It takes a brave man to get into the ring with one of boxing’s archetypal baby-faced assassins. Our own, admirable three-time world title challenger Matthew Macklin nerved himself to do that last year. For his courage he was felled in the third round by a body shot which left him writhing on the canvas and which he describes as ‘the most powerful punch I have ever been hit with.’ Next up Martin Murray. Macklin has warned the man from St Helens of the dangers which lie ahead but Murray believes he can meet the most daunting challenge boxing can offer at the moment and win a world title at his third attempt. Murray has been robbed in Germany by the home-town decision awarded to the then WBA champion Felix Sturm. After that he ventured into the Buenos Aires lair of Argentine ring maestro Sergio Martinez. There he came agonisingly close to winning the WBC belt before suffering his only defeat in 31 fights. It was very close, somewhat controversial, but a loss nonetheless. Now for Golovkin, who has become a favourite of the HBO cable TV network in America but is travelling to Monaco for this one on February 21. Martin Murray (left) is next up for the all-conquering Golovkin after beating Domenico Spada in October . That is partly because the reformed Murray’s criminal record precludes him from obtaining a US visa. For Golovkin, this a holding exercise while he awaits a first mega pay-per-view fight in America, perhaps against Miguel Cotto or Canelo Alvarez. But Murray says: ‘I can be the first to topple him.’ Wednesday's gathering is a pleasantry designed to alert the boxing public in this country to their coming battle for the WBA title. Murray is not fooled. But he never ducks anyone, either. He knows that when the charming chap he welcomes to this country this morning appears in the opposite corner in Monte Carlo, Mr Golovkin will be no more Mr Nice Guy. If Rourke's opponent took a dive his win was a despicable act . There are allegations that the opponent who Mickey Rourke - Hollywood actor and once a bit-part boxer - knocked out in Moscow by way of making a bizarre ring comeback at the disturbing age of 62 was in fact a down-and-out living rough on the streets of Los Angeles who was paid to take a dive. Mickey Rourke (right) faces his opponent, whom it was alleged was paid to take a dive in the fight . If so, this is as much sad as despicable. Sad for the hobo, of course but also for Rourke who, it is further suggested, needs the money from not only this joke fight but as many more as he can finagle. If the allegations are in fact revelations, this supply of cash will dry up pronto. Rourke was a hell-raiser in Tinseltown but celebrity of the infamous genre is rarely insurance against humiliation in later life. Sad for him too, then, that there should be no place in boxing for circus acts like his.","Gennady Gennadyevich Golovkin has won all his 31 fights .

"The awards season is upon us and personally I think it’s a toss up for Best Actor between Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything , Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing in The Imitation Game and Luis Suarez as Count Dracula in The Diving Game. Somehow, even though there is plenty of video footage of Luis the Lip going down more easily than Linda Lovelace in Deep Throat , Senor Suarez is not on the list of Oscar nominations just announced in Hollywood. Nevertheless he gets this column’s gong for his role as a simulator, holding off challenges in the second half of 2014 from several men he left behind in the Premier League, including such unlikely candidates as defenders Branislav Ivanovic and Gary Cahill. A mock-up of how Barcelona striker Luis Suarez may look accepting an Academy Award .

Suarez clashes with Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic after sinking his teeth into the Serb in 2013 .

"David Cameron and Barack Obama yesterday staged a 35-minute ‘treadmill summit’ side by side at a G8 gathering dominated by the Euro crisis. Their crunch talks came as a group of influential Conservative MPs with close links to the Prime Minister and Chancellor George Osborne unveiled dramatic emergency proposals to be taken in the event of ‘Eurogeddon’ – the increasingly likely prospect of a currency meltdown. The ideas include £7 billion cuts in welfare benefits and rejecting EU moves to improve workers’ rights. Divided we fall: From left, Italy's Mario Monti, David Cameron, Angela Merkel, Barack Obama, Francois Hollande and Canada's Stephen Harper . The plan was revealed after the American President summoned the Prime Minister for their workout at Maryland’s Camp David to agree how to bounce Germany’s Angela Merkel into taking action to prop up the single currency. Mr Obama picked up Mr Cameron from the compound’s Maple Cabin where he was staying for a morning run at 7.15am. They walked to the gym together, ran on treadmills and then returned at 7.50am. No 10 officials refused to say which of the leaders ran faster and hinted that the workout was relatively gentle. ‘It was the kind of workout where you can still have a substantive conversation.’ A senior aide said: ‘They spoke the night before but they wanted to have a further conversation. Some might argue this is not the right forum for talking about Eurozone issues but, as the Prime Minister has said, it is appropriate for the G8 to talk about these issues.’ After leaving the treadmill, Mr Cameron said there was ‘a growing sense of urgency’ over the deteriorating political and financial situation in Greece, which risks spreading to other vulnerable EU countries and damaging the British economy. ‘Action needs to be taken, contingency plans need to be put in place and the strengthening of banks, governance, firewalls – all of those things need to take place very fast,’ the Prime Minister said. Idyllic setting: Talks begin between the leaders of (clockwise from lower left) Japan, Italy, Canada, France, the U.S., the UK, Russia, Germany, the European Council and the European Commission . Relaxed: (from left) Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti, U.S. President Barack Obama, David Cameron and Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev listen cheerfully to German Chancellor Angela Merkel during the G8 Summit at Camp David, Maryland . Dress down: The eurozone may be in crisis but David Cameron looked remarkably laid back at the G8 Summit, pictured alongside a grinning Russian PM Dmitri Medvedev and German chancellor Angela Merkel . Greece’s caretaker government was sworn in this week after elections failed to produce a viable coalition to run the country. The result of new elections next month could determine whether the country accepts deep spending cuts set as the condition for an international bailout deal – or quits the bloc of 17 countries that use the Euro. An exclusive poll for today’s Mail on Sunday has found that four in ten people believe Britain and the EU would be better off in the long-run if all Euro nations went back to their own currencies. The view is backed by former Tory Chancellor Nigel Lawson, who today accuses Mr Cameron of talking ‘complete nonsense’ when describing the prospect of a ‘successful Eurozone’. The Mail on Sunday Survation poll reveals that one in six voters fear the break-up of the Euro would lead to riots across the continent. It also shows that UK voters back Left-wing French President Francois Hollande’s demand for new investment to boost growth rather than Mrs Merkel and Mr Cameron’s austerity stance. Asked which EU leader they back, Mr Hollande scores 32 per cent, followed by Mr Cameron on 20  per cent and Mrs Merkel on 16  per cent. The drastic ‘Eurogeddon’ plan, to be unveiled this week by the Conservative Free Enterprise Group, was written by Tory MPs Kwasi Kwarteng and Liz Truss, both tipped for ministerial promotion. The group’s supporters include Tory MPs Matthew Hancock and Sajid Javid, senior advisers to Mr Osborne, and George Eustice, a former aide to Mr Cameron. Mr Kwarteng writes in today’s Mail on Sunday: ‘A currency meltdown would probably deepen recession in Europe. Further cuts in spending would have to be implemented. A cash freeze of benefits for three years would save significant amounts. It seems only fair people receiving benefits should also experience restraint.’ Mr Kwarteng said it could save £7 billion. The Free Enterprise Group also wants to copy German laws on ‘flexible contracts’ for people who earn less than £1,000 a month. ‘They wouldn’t have to pay any tax, yet employers could release them without any repercussions,’ says Mr Kwarteng. And he argues the Government should reject the EU’s union-backed Working Time and Agency Workers regulations, which he said cost the UK more than £5 billion a year. Labour attacked the ‘Eurogeddon’ plan. A senior official said: ‘Most of Europe is moving away from austerity measures. Yet some Tories seem to think it is an excuse to bring in extreme Right-wing measures.’ Last night, disagreements between the G8 countries over the crisis appeared as pronounced as ever. Mr Cameron’s emergency treadmill talks with President Obama came after the Germans sought to prevent the G8 summit from issuing any instructions on the eurozone. A dismayed President Obama intervened after aides to the G8 leaders sat up until 4am on Friday arguing over details of a communiqué demanding action. Britain and America are concerned the Euro crisis will drag the world economy into freefall. Non-Euro countries including  Canada and Japan all wanted to use the summit to force the Germans into action. A source close to Mrs Merkel admitted the aide talks were ‘free and intense’ – diplomatic speak for a blazing row. The Germans refused point-blank to let the G8 issue a call to action on the Eurozone, supported by Italy and France. Britain is now demanding that the Germans let the European Central Bank use quantitative easing to print money and give a monetary boost to the Eurozone economy. In a further complication, the man appointed by President Hollande as his prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, said in an interview that he supported greater trade protectionism. Last week, Mr Cameron said he wanted to lower trade barriers. Last night, it was revealed that Britain is the only one of the world’s eight major economies set to meet its pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid next year. A report issued at the summit shows the average for the G8 last year was just 0.28 per cent. A No 10 spokesperson said: ‘Britain is proud it has met its commitments, but we want others to do the same.’ But Tory MP Philip Davies fumed: ‘It makes us look like the mugs of the Western world.'

New addition: Recently elected French President Francois Hollande (left) shares a joke with the U.S. President as Angela Merkel and David Cameron line up on the lawn . BY FIDELMA COOK . Hair carefully arranged, huge  sunglasses adding to her chic air, the elderly woman had the undoubted look of a lady who lunched. Once, perhaps, her rendezvous would have been with old friends in a smart restaurant close to Athens’ embassy district. Today her appointment was with charity – but she accepted her handout of bean soup in a plastic bowl with all the grace she could muster. It was only when she realised that the outside world, in the form of a photographer and myself, were  witnessing her ‘shame’ that she  faltered. Horrified, she turned away, refusing to discuss the  circumstances that had brought  her to this municipal ‘soup kitchen’. Handouts: Left, a smartly dressed man takes soup in Athens while, right, the elderly kitchen visitor clings to dignity as a fellow diner eats ravenously . ‘She has nothing left but her dignity,’ said a worker who approached her on our behalf. ‘She only started coming here in the past few weeks, and it is still so very hard for her. It will be her one meal of the day. ‘But there are more and more like her now. At first it was the immigrants and the illegals; the homeless. Now they’ve been joined by the young, the professionals, the middle class. And every day more come.’ On their knees, but refusing to be beaten by IMF and eurozone demands, the Greeks are clinging on to that dignity. They are painfully aware that they have been presented to the rest of the world as a work-shy, tax-dodging, culturally corrupt nation who  created their own downfall and  now refuse to pay for it. But they already have paid for it. A quarter of Greek firms have gone bust in three years; employment is at 22 per cent and rising; new property taxes have hit all, as have massive salary, pension and welfare cuts. Yet, on the surface, as one walks through Athens’ chaotic streets, all appears surprisingly normal. Shops still trade and the ubiquitous yellow taxis whizz round with passengers. Xanthia, a 28-year-old journalist on a local newspaper who is now being paid two months in arrears, says: ‘We’re a proud people. I still like to put on a show – sit in the café, all dressed up – it’s something we do, and all looks normal. But stick around for a while and you’ll notice we hold one drink all evening.’ Quietly every day, and the figure is rising, at least 4,000 are fed by the charity of the city, the churches and individual communities. Some say that figure is a woeful underestimate. Schools have been given extra meals for children who have been fainting with hunger. For Fotis Provatas, vice Mayor of Athens, this aid is not in question. ‘There is an old Greek saying of which I am proud,’ he says. ‘The city is mother to the poor. That is our duty.’ Back at the soup kitchen, volunteers like Dimitria Kollia, dole out the food. ‘We’re seeing them younger and younger,’ she says. ‘And also professional couples who’ve lost their jobs. In three months the queue has changed, and that is very frightening for our future.’","As G8 leaders gather at Camp David to patch up Euro deal, Tories plot to use crisis to axe £7billion of benefits ."
"An Indian woman who argued that immigration rules preventing her husband from moving to the UK because he cannot speak English were a breach of the couple’s human rights has lost her case. British citizen Rashida Chapti, 54, argued that her husband of 37 years, Vali Chapti, should be allowed to join her from India. But immigration rules announced by Home Secretary Theresa May last year introduced new English language requirements for those moving to Britain to join a spouse. Rejected: Vali Chapti at home with three of his sons. British citizen Rashida Chapti, 54, argued that Vali, her husband of 37 years, should be allowed to join her from India . Mrs Chapti, who has six children with her 57-year-old husband, argued in the High Court in Birmingham that the rule was a breach of the couple’s right to a private and family life under the European Convention on Human Rights. Using legal aid to fight her case, she also argued that it was a breach of the right to marriage, and the right to be free from discrimination. Yesterday, Mr Justice Beatson ruled that the English language requirement did not amount to a breach of the couple’s human rights and dismissed the case. He said: ‘The new rule does not indirectly discriminate on the ground of nationality, ethnic origins or disability.’ Rashida Chapti, pictured leaving Birmingham High Court with her interpreter, and her husband were one of three couples who challenged an immigration law requiring people to be able to speak English before coming to Britain . Mrs Chapti, from Leicester, who speaks only halting English  herself, vowed to appeal against the decision. Through a translator, she said: ‘Naturally I feel very disappointed. It is Christmas and I will be alone without my husband. We will keep fighting for him to come here.’ She said it would be easier for Mr Chapti, a farmer from the Gujarati village of Valan, to learn English in Britain than India. He cannot read, write or speak the language. She has previously said that he was ‘too old’ to learn English even if he did get leave to stay in Britain. Mrs Chapti, a machinist in a clothes factory, moved to the UK with her parents six years ago, using a British protected passport issued when they lived in Malawi, which was a UK colony. Mrs Chapti is believed to have been commuting between India and Leicester for several years. After successfully applying for naturalisation as a British  citizen, she attempted to ‘send for’ her husband and their  youngest child. But under the new immigration rule, her husband was refused a spouse visa. Previously, spouses and partners were required to demonstrate an ability to speak English two years after moving to Britain. Now they must speak a minimum level of English when they arrive. Mrs Chapti and her husband were one of three couples who challenged the immigration law requiring people to be able to speak English before coming to Britain. At an earlier court hearing, Mrs Chapti’s lawyer Manjit Gill QC said the rule was a breach of the  couple’s human rights. He said: ‘The rule is particularly striking in that it prevents mere residence even though one of the parties is fully entitled to live in this country.’ He said it discriminated against people on the grounds of nationality and race. Dominic Raab, a Tory MP spearheading a parliamentary campaign for human rights reform, said learning the language helped newcomers and encouraged ‘integration rather than segregation’. He said: ‘It’s extremely important that the requirements for newcomers to this country to learn English are upheld and maintained. ‘It is vital for those arriving in this country to be able to get on and for community cohesion.’ Mrs Chapti previously told the BBC: ‘It’s my right to be with my husband and I want to be with him. He is too old to learn English and he lives in a very remote place. ‘It is impossible for him to learn English.’",Three couples challenged law requiring people to speak English before coming to Britain to live with spouse .
"Neil Kinnock has dismissed concerns about Labour’s flagship mansion tax policy . Neil Kinnock has dismissed concerns about Labour’s flagship mansion tax policy, saying it would not cost property millionaires any more each month than the price of a single lunch out. The former party leader said: ‘For the people who are asset-rich and very prosperous, a couple of hundred quid a month isn’t going to make a difference. They would spend that on lunch.’ Those owning homes worth between £2million and £3million would have to pay £250 a month. But the charge is likely to be much higher for those with more expensive properties. The levy will have to average £1,030-a-month to raise its target of £1.2billion a year. Lord Kinnock, who backed Mr Miliband for the leadership in 2010, also said businessmen have nothing to fear from the Labour leader. He told the Financial Times: ‘Nobody’s talking about raising corporate taxation. 'Nobody’s talking about anything other than the encouragement and reward for medium and long-term investment.’ Tory MP Rob Wilson last night tweeted: ‘Socialist Neil Kinnock feels spending £250 on a lunch is no problem. Mind you he was an EU commissioner in Brussels!’ Labour estimates the tax will apply to fewer than 0.5 per cent of the homes in the country, with those earning less than £42,000 able to defer paying the charge until their property changes hands. But the policy has caused division within the party, with senior figures publicly at war with each over whether it is a good idea. Lord Mandelson last month dismissed the plan as ‘crude’ and ‘short-termist’. And Mr Miliband was left humiliated last year after he was unceremoniously taken to task over the proposal by TV personality Myleene Klass.

"This is the hilarious moment a baby polar bear got itself a little tangled while playing with a piece of rope. Pictured rolling around in the snow, the  images show the cute cub with its paws in a bit of a twist. Spotted on the icy plains of Kaktovik, Alaska, the mischievous bear began playing with the chord after noticing it floating near the water's edge. The adorable images show the polar bear cub tangled in a piece of rope and tumbling about in the snow . The two little cubs happily play with the rope while mum takes the opportunity to rest by them . Captured chewing and pulling on the rope, the loveable bear spent over half an hour trying to escape from the rope while its mum took a nap nearby. The poor cub had almost reached the end of its tether when its sibling noticed it was in a spot of bother and stepped in to help. The cub was pictured helping to untangle the other before the pair enjoyed what seemed to be a game of tug of war. The magical moment was spotted by wildlife photographer, Michael D. Stern, 70, who even managed to snap the pair wrestling with the rope and even playing a friendly tug of war. During an intensive seven day trip, Michael spent eight to ten hours on the ice photographing the bears, waiting for the perfect moment to capture his images.

"Pat Copestake, 60, of Cheadle, developed 'thickening' in her left breast . Pat's Unisex Hair Salon is still there, just off the main street in the market town of Cheadle, Staffs. It's a thriving business - the only thing missing is Pat herself. Pat - Patricia Copestake - fulfilled a lifelong dream when she set up the business and gave it her own name, but she had to give it away six years later when she discovered she had breast cancer. Even now, two years on, she feels the same pang about what might have been. And she is angry because it all seems so unnecessary. After the menopause Pat developed what she describes as a 'thickening' in her left breast. After she reached 50, like all women in the UK, she was invited for routine mammograms. Pat underwent four scans between 2004 and 2012 and mentioned the problem at each, but was given a clean bill of health - wrongly. Despite the reassurances, the patch of thickened tissue continued to prey on Pat's mind. 'It was at the top, in the centre just by my chest bone and felt tender,' recalls 60-year-old grandmother Pat. 'It was nothing like the pea-shaped hard lump you're always told about, but I still worried.' Six months after her last mammogram she went to see her GP. Thinking he detected a swollen gland, he prescribed antibiotics. Still unhappy, two weeks later Pat insisted on a referral to the breast care unit at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire. There, an ultrasound scan detected a 'suspicious' lesion, 5cm in diameter. It was diagnosed as a lobular carcinoma, which begins in the milk-producing glands. It turned out to be grade 3 (a fast-growing type), and had spread to the lymph nodes in her armpit. Facing chemotherapy, radiotherapy and repeated surgery - she was eventually to have a lumpectomy, mastectomy and reconstruction of her left breast as well as reduction of her right - Pat wanted to know why the screening process had failed her. She suspected her mammograms had been misread, but a report from an expert, commissioned by her solicitor, found something unexpected. It said the scans had been interpreted correctly. But the report also pointed out that Pat's breast density was between 50 and 75 per cent. 'I'd never heard of breast density,' says Pat, who is married to Graham, 59, a health and safety adviser. Breast density refers to the ratio between the so-called 'dense' and 'fatty' tissues in the breast. Dense tissue includes the ducts of the breast, the lobes that produce the milk or the connective tissues called collagen, explains Katherine Woods, of charity Breast Cancer Campaign. This meant that cancer wasn't visible on four mammograms, but fast-growing tumour was eventually found . A report found the scans had been interpreted correctly (posed by model) 'The rest of the breast is made up of fatty tissue.' Most women's breasts are made up of between 10 to 40 per cent dense tissue. Younger women tend to have denser breasts and the density declines with age. 'After the menopause, some of the denser structures in the breast shrink, and overall breast density declines,' says Ms Woods. But for a significant number of women, like Pat, that doesn't happen: research from Breast Cancer Campaign suggests 720,0000 women over the age of 50 in the UK have dense breast tissue. After the age of 50, women are offered a three-yearly mammogram - a low-dose X-ray of the breast. Yet for those with dense breast tissue, mammograms may be less useful because the images produced show fatty tissue as dark and cancerous tumours are white. That's because the tumours absorb X-rays but fatty tissue doesn't. The problem is that dense breast tissue also absorbs X-rays and therefore also shows up white. This could explain why Pat's cancer was not visible on mammograms. The biggest concern is that dense breasts put women at greater risk of cancer in the first place. 'A study in 2006 confirmed something we'd suspected for years - breast density is a strong risk factor,' says Ms Woods. In Britain there's hardly any information about dense breasts, says Pat, unlike in America . Women with dense breasts therefore face a double whammy - higher risk of breast cancer, but their tumours may not show up at screening. 'It seems strange it's not more known,' adds Ms Woods. 'It hasn't come into the public consciousness here.' Research suggests breast density is mainly due to inherited factors, though age, body mass index and menopause also have an influence. It is also thought that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may increase breast density. And one long-term study of 1,319 women published in 2010 found those who consumed more calories in their 30s and 40s were more likely to have dense breast tissue in their 50s. Though mammograms can indicate breast density, in the UK it is not standard procedure to tell patients about this or offer an alternative type of screening, such as ultrasound or MRI. That's the fact that makes Pat really angry. According to Breast Cancer Campaign, a woman with 75 per cent breast density has a five-times higher risk of cancer. In fact, in Pat's case the radiographer did record the breast density on her notes as a 'significant finding', but she was never told. 'I feel I've done everything I should have - I mentioned lumpy breasts to my GP on many occasions,' says Pat. 'If I'd known about the dense breast tissue, I would have happily paid for an ultrasound scan privately.' It's a different story in the U.S. where 19 states have passed laws compelling healthcare professionals to inform women if mammogram shows high breast density so they can consider alternative screening. Public Health England confirmed there is no general protocol for radiographers dealing with dense breast tissue, but that in 'some circumstances' patients will be offered an MRI as well - if they are considered high risk due to family history or genetic factors. However, there is hope that a new scan - digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) - may improve screening. This takes multiple X-rays to create a 3D image. While research into DBT is ongoing, what should women do now? The proportion of women in the UK who have dense breast tissue. Both mammograms and MRI scans are capable of revealing a woman's breast density and patients can ask for that information. But as Ms Woods points out, breast density is one of many risk factors women face. Maintaining a healthy weight, exercising and reducing alcohol intake can reduce breast cancer risk by 30 per cent. Pat is taking a hormone therapy, anastrozole, to reduce her levels of oestrogen as this can stimulate the growth of breast cancer. But it will be another eight years until she knows if she is free of the disease. For her, perhaps hardest of all is knowing she can't donate a kidney to her son, Ryan, 33, who has kidney failure. In 2012, she had been found to be a perfect match and was preparing for the operation. However, due to her cancer she's been told she's not eligible until she's been clear for five years. Now Pat wants to spread the word about dense breast tissue. 'In Britain there's hardly any information about dense breasts,' says Pat. 'You go to the U.S. websites and they say 'Are You Dense?'. Well I was and I felt it.' Pat in her Cheadle-based Unisex Hair Salon before she was diagnosed with breast cancer .","Pat Copestake, 60, of Cheadle, developed  'thickening' in her left breast .

"A new applicant is signing on to claim Disability Living Allowance every nine minutes – just a few weeks before it is blocked to first-time claimants. Some 164 more people are given the benefit each day, the latest figures show. There were 15,000 new claims over three months, compared with 11,000 during the same period last year. The rush to secure the state payout is thought to be because its replacement will have tougher eligibility tests. Reforms: The rush to secure Disability Living Allowance comes ahead of new, tougher eligibility criteria . In the past decade, the number of people receiving DLA has soared by more than a third, from 2.4million to 3.3million. The cost to the taxpayer is now £13billion a year. An astonishing seven out of ten claimants – 71 per cent – have been offered the benefit for life without any checks to see if they still need it, according to the Department for Work and Pensions. Rise: A new applicant is signing on to claim DLA every nine minutes, the latest figures show . From April, DLA will gradually be replaced by the Personal Independence Payment (PIP), which is being introduced in an attempt to cut the nation’s benefits bill. To get the PIP, people must have a face-to-face assessment, rather than simply filling out a form. At first, the change will apply only to new applicants in the North of England, but it will be rolled out nationwide in June. Those already on DLA will begin to be reassessed from October. Most will not face checks until 2015, after a review of the system gives its findings in 2014. The one-on-one interviews are being brought in to look at exactly how someone’s impairment affects their ability to live a normal life. They will look at a broad range of everyday activities such as cooking and getting around. Government estimates show that without reform, DLA claims would grow by more than 400,000 in the next five years. The number receiving the grant was forecast to have reached 3.6million by 2018 unless it was replaced with the PIP. That would be more than treble the number – 1.1million – who received the benefit when it was created under a Tory government in 1992. Deal: 71 per cent of claimants have been offered DLA for life without checks, according to the DWP (pictured) Esther McVey, the minister for disabled people, said: 'Disability Living Allowance is an outdated benefit introduced over 20 years ago. 'Outdated': Disabled People Minister Esther McVey . 'The Personal Independence Payment will include a new face-to-face assessment and regular reviews – something missing in the current system.’ She added: 'Our welfare reforms are about ensuring the billions we spend on disability benefits give more targeted support to those who need it most.' Unlike other benefits, which will go up by only 1 per cent this year, DLA and the PIP will grow with inflation, rising 2.2 per cent. The PIP, like DLA, will be a non-means-tested, non-taxable cash benefit which can be claimed whether in or out of work. It will pay £53 a week, with a £79.15 enhanced rate for those who need constant care. There are also mobility grants to help people get around, of £21 a week or a £55.25 higher rate. The reforms provoked anger from disability rights groups. A recent poll by campaign organisation Disability Alliance found 9 per cent of respondents said losing their DLA 'may make life not worth living’. The group has also protested that the Government had already identified desired cuts in spending before consulting the public on which elements of benefits needed to be reformed. An earlier version of this article stated that half of all decisions on Disability Living Allowance are made ‘without any medical evidence’. We are happy to clarify that this referred to any additional information above that already declared on application forms and any accompanying reports from GPs, consultants or other health professionals.","Some 164 more people are given the benefit each day, the latest figure show .

"Pieter Schelte Hareema, a Dutch officer in the Waffen SS during the Second World War, who has had the world's largest ship named after him . The arrival of the world's largest ship in Europe has provoked outrage after it was revealed it was named after a SS Nazi war criminal. The Pieter Schelte, which is so big it can lift oil rigs out of the water, is docked in Rotterdam after being constructed at the Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering shipyard in South Korea. It arrived in Holland just three weeks before the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz and just days before four Jews were killed in a kosher supermarket during the Paris terror attacks. But as Holocaust Memorial Day nears, anger has erupted after it was revealed Pieter Schelte Heerema was a Dutch officer in the Waffen SS. The vice president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, Jonathan Arkush told the Observer: 'Naming such a ship after an SS officer who was convicted of war crimes is an insult to the millions who suffered and died at the hands of the Nazis. 'We urge the ship's owners to reconsider and rename the ship after someone more appropriate.' The ship's arrival in Rotterdam has been trumpeted by energy company Royal Dutch Shell, which in a press release by Allseas confirms it will be one of the vessel's first clients. John Donovan, a former Shell contractor who has wrote a book on the company's relations to the Third Reich also told the newspaper: 'This public homage by Edward Heerema as the wealthy son of a Nazi war criminal is an affront to the relatives of tens of millions of souls who perished at the hands of Nazi Germany.' Schelte was the father of Dutchman Edward Heerema, the owner of company Allseas, who commissioned the building of the ship. He was an officer in the Waffen SS during the Second World War, when he acted as a director for the Dutch East Company. It is thought he was responsible for recruiting Dutch men to be put into forced labour in Nazi-occupied territories in Eastern Europe. The Pieter Schelte vessel, the world's largest ship, which is almost as long as the Empire State Building and wider than the height of Big Ben . The ship, which is currently docked in Rotterdam, is owned by Allseas and was built at the Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering shipyard in South Korea . However, he is reported to have left the SS in 1944 as he lost sympathy with the Nazis and joined a resistance party, fleeing to Switzerland. He was tried and sentenced to three years in prison for war crimes after the war but was released early and went to Venezuela  where he set up a engineering company. Schelte was an officer in the Waffen SS during the Second World War, when he acted as a director for the Dutch East Company. He married his wife in The Hague during the war and was pictured wearing his SS uniform, with the ceremony attended by other high-ranking SS figures. It is thought he was responsible for recruiting Dutch men to put into forced labour in Nazi-occupied territories in Eastern Europe. However, he is reported to have left the SS after losing sympathy with the Nazis in 1944 and joined a resistance party, fleeing to Switzerland. He was tried and sentenced to three years in prison for war crimes but was released early and went to Venezuela, where he set up a engineering company. His namesake ship measures a staggering 1,253ft (382 metres) long and 407ft (124 metres) wide, making it almost as long as the Empire State Building is tall and wider than the height of Big Ben. It cost £1.9 billion ($3.1 billion) to build and is powered by 11.2 megawatt engines connected to 13 Rolls Royce 5.5 megawatt thrusters. Topsides - the upper section of oil rigs - weighing up to 48,000 tons can be lifted by the behemoth, while it will also be able to lift jackets - the legs - of rigs weighing up to 25,000 tonnes. The ship can then transport both the top and bottom sections of the oil rig simultaneously and take it back to port. It can even raise and lower itself in the water by 82ft (25 metres) in order to cope with the huge weight demands of moving an oil rig. It can reach speeds of 14 knots (16.1 mph or 25.9 km/h) and has space for a crew of 571 people. It will also be the world's largest pipelaying ship and will be used to construct infrastructure under the sea.

"The head of a Christian lobby group has claimed Tom Daley, right, is homosexual, because his father Robert, left, died . The head of a Christian charity has today provoked outrage by reportedly claiming Olympic diver Tom Daley is homosexual because his father died. Andrea Minichiello Williams, the founder of lobby group Christian Concern, has been accused of exacerbating suicidal thoughts among lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people across the world. It comes as LGBT campaigners within the Church of England brand her unchristian and her comments 'deeply damaging to the Christian faith and the Church'. She is said to have rejected the notion that homosexuality is inborn, blaming the 'lack of the father' and 'sometimes a level of abuse' for creating homosexual thoughts, the Independent reported. Drawing an example, Mrs Williams, who was speaking at a conference in Jamaica, pointed to the case of Olympic diver Tom Daley, who came out in a YouTube selfie video last month. She blamed the death of Daley's father Robert in 2011 as being the catalyst for his homosexual feelings. She said Daley had been 'loved by all the girls and had girlfriends', but had 'lost his father to cancer just a few years ago'. Mrs Williams, who is an elected member of the Church of England General Synod - the body which passes measures which once approved by Parliament become law - was visiting the Caribbean island to lobby against moves to change the law, which currently bans sex between men. An 1864 Jamaican law prohibits sex between men. But in June Javed Jaghai, a gay right's activist, appeared in court on the island in an effort to bring constitutional change. She said: 'Might it be that Jamaica says to the United States of America, says to Europe; ""Enough! You cannot come in and attack our families. We will not accept aid or promotion tied to an agenda that is against God and destroys our families,' reported US website Buzzfeed. Pro Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and . Transgender (LGBT) groups have today condemned Mrs Williams' claims, . branding her 'unchristian' and accusing her of 'damaging the Church of . England'. Andrea Minichiello Williams, founder of Christian Concern, left, is reported to have said Tom Daley, right, came out because his father died. Robert Daley passed away in 2011 battling a brain tumour for five years . Christian LGBT campaigners have hit out at Mrs Williams' claims that diver Tom Daley is homosexual because his father died, condemning her comments as unChristian and 'damaging to the Christian faith and Church of England' Reverend Colin Coward, director of Changing Attitude, a network of LGBT members of the Church of England campaigning for full inclusion, said . 'Andrea Minichiello Williams is repeating the familiar myth that is repeatedly used by those campaigning against full inclusion of LGBT Christians in the church both in the UK and the US. 'They rely on out-of-date, flawed research and authors to support this. 'Those who are reasonably content with being gay, the huge majority know that this (the lack of a father) has no relationship with being gay. 'Being gay is a personal identity, it is my identity and Mrs Williams is simply trying to perpetuate an anti-gay theology. 'What she is doing is unchristian and against the teaching of the Church of England, which has repeatedly stated it fully welcomes and accepts lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. 'I think she (Mrs Williams) may be naive but what she is doing something that is deeply damaging to the Christian faith as well as to the people who are naturally gay and whose gender and sexual identity is different to the majority. 'In doing so she exacerbates feelings of depression and suicidal thoughts of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Christians across the world.' Tom Daley, third from right, is in a relationship with Hollywood screenwriter Dustin Lance Black, left . The 19-year-old Olympic Bronze medalist told fans in the YouTube clip he was in a relationship with a man and that his life had changed after meeting his partner in the spring . Echoing Rev Coward's criticism of Mrs Williams, the LGBT charity Stonewall said her comments were 'sad'. Sam Dick, the charity's head of policy, said: ‘It’s sad that, during the season of peace and love, these campaigners are supporting the prosecution of gay people simply for how they were born. 'We’re sure many Christians would believe that the more Christian course of action would be to spend their time fighting issues like poverty and disease.’ Yesterday Martin Warner, the Bishop of Chichester, where Mrs Williams was elected to the General Synod in 2011, condemned the comments. He told the Independent that they had 'no sanction in the Church of England' and that they 'should be rejected as offensive and unacceptable'. When approached by the MailOnline Christian Concern said Mrs Williams is not currently available for comment.","Founder of Christian Concern Andrea Minichiello Williams is reported to have made the comments at a conference in Jamaica .

"The biggest surprise about that charming bunch of so-called Chelsea fans shoving a Frenchman off the Paris Metro just because he was black is that so many people found it surprising. Do we really believe incidents like this are not occurring whenever and wherever football crowds gather? Come off it. It just so happens that this one was caught on film. The man attempts to board  but is refused entry by fans travelling to the Champions League tie in Paris . The amateur footage goes on to show passengers in the carriage following the disgraceful incident . These particular yobs fell foul of the technology which is revealing more and more of the horrors of the world in which we live. By way of extreme example, there would be no global revulsion and no condemnation of the atrocities being committed in the perverted name of Islam were it not for those videos of hostages being decapitated and burned alive, homosexuals being thrown off roofs, women whose veils slip being stoned to death and non-believers being converted to the Muslim faith by amputations of their arms and legs. No military intervention by the western powers, either. Barbaric monstrosities are nothing new. Except that now they appear on our television screens. There are parallels, albeit mercifully less graphic, with hooliganism. The advent of closed circuit cameras has done more than any other measure to minimise violence in our football stadia. But genuine supporters and innocent passers-by are still being terrorised on their way to and from the grounds, be it in the surrounding streets, on railway platforms or at motorway service stations. The authorities tell us the curse has been cured. The reality is that football-related violence has merely been suppressed. Of course, in large measure, that is because an undercurrent of these angry, brutal tendencies continues to course through our society. We still are a warrior nation, after all. Chelsea fans are kept back by police after the final whistle of the Champions League match on Tuesday night . A map showing where the incident occurred at the Richelieu-Drouot station and where the stadium is (left) Gary Lineker, presenter and ex footballer: 'Just saw the video of the Chelsea mob's deplorable behaviour and racist chants. Sickening, embarrassing, moronic, disgraceful.' Paul Canoville, Chelsea's first ever black footballer: 'I watched it and I was in disgust, I was so angry and ashamed. We’ve done so much campaigning against the very issue of racism and this happens and it’s brought it all right back down. I don’t care if it’s the minority because regardless of that it is connected to the club and when you mention Chelsea this will be the response. I can’t believe this has come about.' Stan Collymore, pundit and ex footballer: 'Chelsea fans. Save your spite for those on the train, I'm sure you'll want to see them banned from holding season tickets at your club.' Jason Roberts, pundit and ex footballer: 'I hope that every black Chelsea Player watches that.' Sepp Blatter, FIFA president: 'I also condemn the actions of a small group of Chelsea fans in Paris. There is no place for racism in football.' Ian Wright, pundit and ex footballer: 'Chelsea what you gonna do? Your club has been linked to racism for so long! What have you done? Put a couple of signs up in your ground? Those guys on the train remind me of my childhood. Chase you with their mates! But when alone and confronted, I've seen them cry.' It manifests itself in road rages, pub brawls, rapes of inebriated women and gratuitous physical harm inflicted during robberies and muggings. And in truth it is getting worse. Those of us who bore dismayed witness to the riots which shamed our nation and its game in the 70s, 80s and early 90s – and who mourned at such fatal tragedies as Heysel and Hillsborough – have welcomed every innovation, from those cameras to all-seater stadia, which has put the lid on this scourge. But suppressed it remains. Not eradicated. And the most recent evidence indicates that hooliganism is on the rise again. Such is human nature that complacency is pretty much inevitable when something like heavy policing appears to have solved a problem. And there have been glimpses of late of disturbances returning to the stands and incursions onto the pitches. Complacency mushrooms into negligence when government starts paying heed to campaigns for a throw-back to so-called ‘safe standing.’ Mr Prime Minister, consider yourself warned that the activists are all too aware that moving, shoving crowds have long provided the cover for hooligan rampages. And so to Paris. Chelsea, the FA and Downing Street have condemned what happened on the way to the West London club’s Champions League match in the Parc des Princes on Tuesday night. They and they victim are calling for arrests, charges, perhaps prison sentences. But the reaction of other responsible bodies – UEFA and to some extent the Premier League – has been to abdicate responsibility for any outrages taking place in the city rather than the stadium. That is not just disingenuous. It is cowardly cheating. The English game has done more than most in trying to kick out racism but it is not good enough simply to boot the thugs out of the ground, onto the streets. If you organise big, money-making football matches you have a duty of care as to what happens on the way to and from those events. Be aware, gentlemen. Football hooligans crawl out of the holes created by the burial of heads in the sand. There was a belief back in football’s darkest days that hooliganism was incited by the violence of players on the pitch. If that still holds true, it is reasonable to suppose that in addition to the man-handling of a black Metro passenger on the way to Chelsea’s Champions League game at Paris on Tuesday night there was more trouble in the city later that night which went unrecorded. The way the PSG team queued up to kick Eden Hazard was nothing short of disgraceful. Hazard’s controlled response – riding the assaults and restraining his emotions – was noble, putting to shame the opponents trying to kick him out of the match and the referee who failed to protect him. Eden Hazard appeared to be targeted by players of PSG in their Champions League tie on Tuesday night . The Belgian forward is sent tumbling by PSG defender Maxwell during the 1-1 draw at the Parc des Princes . Chelsea forward Hazard is surviving at the moment thanks to his stocky build and solid bones . Thus he played a major part in enabling Chelsea to come through a fraught assignment by bringing home to the second leg at Stamford Bridge the 1-1 draw which included that precious away goal. But in truth Hazard is being treated almost as scandalously here every week. That is the price which referees and the ruling bodies of the game appear to think he should pay for being the best player in the Premier League. Hazard is surviving at the moment thanks to his stocky build, solid bones, nimble evasion of some of the more malicious lunge and considerable courage. Since he could well have used this as an excuse to go seek safer and more enriching employment at Real Madrid or Barcelona, Chelsea and their fans should be deeply grateful that he has signed a two-year extension to his contract. The least we can do by way of rewarding this electrifying young footballer is for we writers to elect him as Footballer of the Year and his peers honour him as their Player of the Year.","The biggest surprise abut the so-called supporters shoving a man off the Metro because he was black, is that so many found it surprising .

"Italian officials are seeking a staggering £177m (€220m) in damages from a cruise line company after two popular tourist regions suffered a major blow following the Costa Concordia disaster. Tuscany's government wants £25m (€30m) in compensation from Costa Cruises, a unit of Carnival Corp., arguing that its image has been tarnished and tourism has declined significantly. And a separate claim by the island of Giglio, where the 950-ft-long cruiser ran aground in January 2012, has been put in for £152m (€190m). Scroll down for video . Two huge compensation claims have been filed against Costa Cruises over the January 2012 disaster . The case against Costa Concordia captain Francesco Schettino, who faces multiple charges, is ongoing . The government of Tuscany says its image has been tarnished and tourism suffered . The Costa Concordia was carrying more than 4,000 passengers and crew when it struck rocks off the Tuscan island of Giglio and capsized, killing 32 people. The ship remained partially submerged near the port of the holiday island for more than two years before being raised and towed away this year in one of the largest and most complex maritime salvages ever completed. According to a statement, Tuscany's president, Enrico Rossi, announced that the region was filing a compensation claim, telling a court in the city of Grosseto: 'We will ask Costa for €30m in damages to Tuscany's image.' Thirty-two people died after the Costa Concordia ran aground off the island of Giglio in January 2012 . The mission to upright and salvage the ship will reportedly cost hundreds of millions of pounds . The ship has been  towed to a port in Genoa for scrapping . Mr Rossi said the region had registered a decline in tourism, and that Giglio alone had lost 45,000 visitors due to the disaster. A consultant to Giglio's local government, Carlo Scarpa, asked the same court for £152m (€190m) in damages, according to a source present during the proceedings. The two officials spoke during an ongoing trial against Costa Concordia Captain Francesco Schettino, who is being tried for multiple charges, including manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship. Underwater footage shows the remains of the cruise liner as it was submerged off Giglio . The eerie footage  gives a haunting insight into the last moments of the luxury cruise ship . The stricken ship has been moved to Genoa, where it is being dismantled and sold for scrap . Mr Rossi told court: 'To reconstruct the image of Tuscany as a top tourist destination will require years of work, substantial investments and costly national and international advertising campaigns.' Costa Cruises last year avoided a criminal trial by agreeing to pay a €1m fine to the Italian state, but victims and local administrations have pursued damages separately. Shortly after the shipwreck, Costa Cruises also agreed to pay about €11,000 to each of the passengers for items lost and any psychological damages to those who suffered no physical injuries.","Tuscan officials demanding £25m claim tourism been harmed .

"If you thought the Black Friday shopping fights were crazy then just look what happened when a re-issue of shoes first worn 15 years ago by basketball legend Michael Jordan went on sale. Madness was breaking out today at stores across the U.S. as impatient shoppers queued up to get their hands on the first new Nike retro Air Jordan shoes that went on sale for $180 this morning. Police used pepper spray in Seattle, Washington; four people were arrested in Atlanta, Georgia; there were fights in Louisville, Kentucky, and unruly crowds forced two stores shut in Austin, Texas.

In Pineville, North Carolina, dozens of police officers had to break up fights and restore order inside Carolina Place Mall as early as 5am on Friday. Outside the Foot Locker on the second floor, two could be seen throwing punches as they waited to get their hands on the Air Jordan XI Concord tennis shoe. Witnesses said some shoppers started jumping the line, then a crowd of people at the back of the line forced their way to the front, causing several people to get angry and become unruly. 'People were falling, I had to jump over a girl, it was crazy,' Dominique Brewer said.‘One kid was trampled and hurt his arm, maybe even broke it,’ a Troy Police spokesman told Patch, after shoppers had lined up at two Foot Locker stores from 4am for the highly-anticipated shoes. He added that ‘shouting’ crowds outside both stores became ‘unruly’ and police had to escort some shoppers to their cars after they had bought the Nike Air Jordan XI Retro ‘Concord’ shoes . Air Jordans are hugely lucrative for Nike and bring in around $1billion in revenue each year. Oregon designer Tinker Hatfield first developed the iconic shoes and they were made famous by basketball legend Michael Jordan in 1996 while he was playing for the Chicago Bulls.

"It’s a radical aircraft design that could one day see passengers flying in circles. Airbus has filed a patent application for an unusual concept plane that has been dubbed a ‘flying doughnut’. Instead of queuing on a jet bridge, passengers would board the UFO-like aircraft at ground level via an escalator and an ‘access hatch’, and they would enjoy more space on flights. 'Flying doughnut': This drawing shows Airbus' concept for a new aircraft with a circular cabin . Passengers would board the UFO-like aircraft at ground level via an escalator and an ‘access hatch’ The futuristic plane has a circular cabin with curved aisles and a hole in the middle, giving it the shape of a doughnut. Passengers in economy would be seated in the outer ring, while business seating would be located within the inner ring. The unconventional aircraft, shaped like a Stealth Bomber, would be lighter and have more cabin space for travellers while solving a long-standing problem related to cabin pressure. According to a 15-page patent application filed late last month, the concept plane would be free from the stress that cabin pressure places on cylindrical aircraft, meaning it would be more economic and efficient. The plane has a circular cabin with curved aisles and a hole in the middle, giving it the shape of a doughnut . Conventional planes have sealed bottoms with heavy fasteners to withstand the loads induced by cabin pressurisation. In its patent filing, the France-based manufacturer wrote: ‘The present invention proposes an aircraft wherein the structure delimiting passenger cabin extends over 360 degrees around a space defined outside structure. ‘The invention allows structure to be more resistant to loads induced by the cabin pressurization, while allowing to reduce or even to avoid the need for a sealed bottom.’ Airbus spokesman Justin Dubon told NPR that the design may never be in production as the company files over 600 patent applications every year. He said: ‘Some of these become the seed for other ideas with practical use.’ Airbus has come out with a number of futuristic concepts, including a virtual reality isolation helmet . The France-based manufacturer has patented a design for benches with bicycle-like saddle seats . Airbus, which manufactures the A380, the world’s largest passenger plane, has patented a number of futuristic concepts that may never materialise. One of them is a virtual reality isolation helmet, which looks like a prop from a Star Wars film. With comfort in mind it would cancel out peripheral noise – including crying children or chatty adults – and allow passengers to immerse themselves in in-flight entertainment. Each headset would come with a built-in video screen, glasses for better viewing, earphones and a mini-airbag to protect the head during extreme turbulence. Other concepts include windowless cockpits, benches with bicycle-like saddle seats and an external audio system that would mimic bird noises to prevent bird strikes.","Passengers would board aircraft via an escalator and 'access hatch'

"Ford is recalling about 65,000 Fusion midsize cars in North America because the ignition keys can be removed if the transmission is not in park. The recall covers certain Fusions, including gas-electric hybrids, from the 2014 and 2015 model years. Ford traced the problem to a computer program in the instrument cluster. Recalled: This August 29, 2013 file photo shows a new 2014 Ford Fusion at the Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Flat Rock, Michigan . Keys can be removed 30 minutes after the ignition switch is turned off if the cars are left in gear. That violates U.S. safety regulations and increases the risk of cars rolling away unexpectedly. Ford says it's not aware of any crashes or injuries from the problem. Dealers will reprogram the instrument cluster at no cost to owners. The recall covers about 55,000 vehicles in the U.S., with the rest in Canada and Mexico. The Fusion is Ford's best-selling sedan in the U.S. market. Its sales through October this year were about 250,000, up 20per cent from the first ten months of last year.","The recall covers certain Fusions, including gas-electric hybrids, from the 2014 and 2015 model years .

"Two brothers have been kicked out of classes at school and made to study in isolation because they have spiky haircuts. Keiran Matthews, 16, and his 13-year-old brother Callum, returned for lessons at Marches School in Oswestry, Shropshire, last week proudly sporting their new styles. But teachers branded their haircuts 'extreme' and took them out of their classes and placed them in isolation instead. Keiran Matthews and his brother Callum, who were both taken out of classes at school because they have spiky hair . They said that the style, which is closely shaved on the sides but spiky on top, broke school rules and their policy on uniform. Today, the teens' father Tony, 44, told of his anger at the ban on the style, which is called the skinfade, as he says most children are sporting it these days. He explained: 'I understood the school has its policies that include hairstyles. 'But I’m just angry they seem to have been singled out. 'There are so many boys at the Marches that have the same haircut and they do not seem to have been sent to the pastoral room. The brothers were being made to study by themselves in isolation after teachers branded their hairstyles 'extreme' 'It’s an area where children are segregated from the rest of the school. 'They are not allowed to go outside for break and Callum had his lunch brought to him - a pizza that he said was cold and he couldn’t eat.' Mr Matthews said it was only when he mentioned that other boys, including his older son, had similar haircuts, that Keiran was also told to work in pastoral. He added: 'When they contacted me last week and said that yet again they were going into pastoral, then I went and picked them up from school. 'Keiran is in his last year at school and, with exams coming up, it is vital that he goes into lessons. The boys attend the Marches School in Oswestry, Shropshire, pictured, who say they have a clear uniform policy . 'The boys and I have talked about hairstyles and we have agreed that in the future they will not have hairstyles such as this.' Sarah Longville, headteacher at the school, which caters for 1,200 pupils aged 11 to 18, said: 'We are unable to discuss individual cases involving students due to their age and vulnerability. 'We have clear policies at the school, that have been in place for many years, and parents/carers and students are made fully aware of these. 'We set high standards for all students and when our policies are not adhered to, we work supportively with parents and the appropriate action is taken.'","Keiran and Callum Matthews returned to Marches School with new haircuts .

"A new video has given a unique insight into why men feel they have a right to harass women in the street. In the short documentary, which was created by Gothamist in response to a recently-released video which documented a woman being harassed as she walked through New York City, a number of men and women are questioned about their thoughts on cat-calling, and asked for their opinions on why so many men are guilty of the sexist practice. While a number of the women interviewed explain how upsetting they find it, most of the men admit that they can't understand why anyone would view catcalling as offensive - with one going as far as to claim that commenting on women in the street is his 'right'. Scroll down for video . 'It's my right as an American citizen': This man explained that, if he sees a beautiful woman, he feels he is justified in making a comment about her appearance . 'It's my right as an American citizen to place whatever I want to say,' he explains. 'I whistle, I do the suck. Do you understand what I'm saying? If you have a beautiful body, why can't I say something?' A few of the men try to claim that women are to blame for any harassment or abuse that they receive - particularly if they choose to wear tight-fitting or provocative clothing. 'It's my point of view,' one teenage boy explains. 'When a girl comes out, in in public, with tight leggings and you can see something like that... I'm saying something.' Another adds: 'If you do not like guys to try and track you then try not to wear tight clothes,' while a third man suggests: 'If she's uncomfortable, that might be her own personal issue. Maybe she's insecure.' 'This man came out of nowhere and grabbed her': During one of the interviews, a man approached this young girl and put his arm around her before the interviewer sent him away . 'Don't wear tight clothes': All of these young teenagers admit to harassing women in the street, with the young man on the left suggesting provocative clothing was to blame for their behavior . Ironically, as one of the women in the video points out, many of the men who are guilty of harassing women in the street admit that they would be furious to see the same thing being done to their own female friends and family members. 'If you think about it, yeah, you're still doing that to somebody else's sister or mother and that's wrong,' one confesses. While all the available evidence suggests that catcalling rarely - if ever - leads to any kind of positive social interaction, Debjani Roy, deputy director of the advocacy group Hollaback, told Gothamist that many men just don't understand the negative message that they are sending to women by yelling out at them in the street. 'I've seen, you know, the light bulb go off in someone's mind,' she said of Hollaback's efforts to educate young men about street harassment. 'It's not effective,' she said. 'According to all the stories we've read and people we've spoken to, it does not work.'","The video shows a group of New Yorkers being interviewed about catcalling .

"France will continue to evict gypsies who camp illegally, the French interior minister said while visiting Romania. Minister Manuel Valls’ comments today came after French police expelled hundreds of Roma from illegal camps in Parisian suburbs in August and in similarly in Lyon and Lille. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, also expressed her concern about Roma rights on Monday. Continue to evict: French Interior Minister Manuel Valls said, while visiting Romania, that police will continue to evict gypsies from illegal camps . In Romania, where more than one million Roma live, Mr Valls said: ‘France has a policy of evacuating illegal camps and of escorting them to the border.’ It comes as Romania and France signed a two-year deal to repatriate dozens of Roma families yesterday. Around 80 families will return to Romania under the pilot programme signed by Mr Valls and European Affairs Minister Bernard Cazeneuve during talks with Romanian officials in Bucharest. Raids on Roma: Mr Valls' comments came after hundreds of Roma were expelled in raids including Evry near Paris, pictured, earlier this month . Squalid camps: An estimated 15,000 to 20,000 Roma immigrants live in camps on the outskirts of French cities, including Evry near Paris where a camp was raided, pictured . Under the new socialist government, Mr Valls has continued the much criticised repatriation policies of the previous conservative French government and defended the police raids to break up Roma camps on the basis of health grounds. He said in Romania after meeting Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta: ‘We wish to send a message to the public that... our joint efforts should be focussed on a solution in which the Roma settle in their country of origin, Romania.’ The Roma come mostly from Romania and Bulgaria, fellow European Union member states that human rights groups say discriminate against the minority group. An estimated 15,000 to 20,000 Roma immigrants live in France mainly in squalid camps in city outskirts. The French authorities say they lack the necessary residency permits. Deal signed: Mr Valls shakes Romanian counterpart Mircea Dusa's hand as after signing a two-year deal to repatriate Roma families . Human rights concern: Navi Pillay, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, expressed concerns about Roma rights on Monday . Mr Valls has said in the past that the camps were a ‘challenge’ to ‘people living together’ and that neighbours of the camps often complained about noise and anti-social behaviour, as well as serious crimes. Humanitarian organisations have also linked the camps to ill health, including serious diseases such as tuberculosis. Criticised: During his presidency, Nicolas Sarkozy was scrutinised for the crack down on illegal Roma camps and accused of 'ethnic cleansing' The Romanian leader said his country . accepted its responsibility to integrate the Roma community, adding that . his government needed support from the European Union and France. Roughly 200 Roma and supporters protested earlier outside the government and president's offices, saying Romanian officials were only pretending to care about the problems facing their minority. France's actions have come under close scrutiny from U.N. human rights investigators, as well as the European Union, which two years ago criticised a crackdown on illegal Roma camps launched by Nicolas Sarkozy, who lost the presidency in May. Roma groups accused Mr Sarkozy of ‘ethnic cleansing’. Romania has been a full member of the European Union since 2007 and its citizens can enter France without a visa. But they must get residency permits if they want to settle long term and work.","French interior minister Manuel Valls said police will continue to evict gypsies from illegal camps in France .

"Nike has been forced to remove a pair of tattoo-style leggings from its range after they were criticised for being culturally exploitative. The monochrome printed garments have sparked controversy in Australia and New Zealand where residents say the design of the Pro Tattoo Tech Tights is similar to the traditional Samoan Pe'a male tattoo. New Zealand's ONE News reports that by using the traditionally male print on women's leggings, Nike has offended many people in the Pacific community, who find it to be exploitative in the first place. Nike's Pro Tattoo Tech Tights have sparked controversy in Australia and New Zealand where some people say the design is too similar to the traditional Samoan Pe'a male tattoo . New Zealand parliament member Su'a William Sio told ONE News: 'Before you launch into something like this, there's generally a consultation.' 'I don't think Nike has taken the time to do that.' The Nike Pro Tattoo Tech collection was unveiled over a month ago and it was noted that they had taken inspiration from the tatau - the traditional tattoos - of Fiji, Samoa, and New Zealand. An online petition against the leggings was posted in early August on Change.org petition, which described them as a . 'direct violation of the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific, and is . furthermore in violation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of . Indigenous Peoples'. Some 750 people signed an online petition against the leggings, posted in early August, which described the leggings as a 'direct violation of the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific' Nike were quick to withdraw the leggings after 750 people signed the petition and the sports brand released the following statement: 'The Nike Tattoo Tech collection was inspired by tattoo graphics. 'We apologise to anyone who views this design as insensitive to any specific culture. No offence was intended.' Facebook users, however, didn't seem to find the leggings offensive. One user wrote: 'Oh that's ridiculous. People are too sensitive. It's a pair of leggings. How is that offensive. The culture has inspired the fashion.' Facebook users didn't seem to find the leggings offensive and said that we should share cultures to educate each other . Another added: 'We should all be willing to share our cultures in order to educate others so we have a greater understanding of each other.' While another said: 'This is really beautiful,,, i'm sorry where is the racism here?

Detective Constable Guy Whitfield said that even though the CCTV images were grainy, the description of the suspect was 'so unusual' police felt someone would be able to recognise him . Detective Constable Guy Whitfield, from Birmingham's Violent Crime investigation team, said: 'The CCTV footage is very grainy and we appreciate this is not of the best quality but we felt that the description was so unusual that someone would be able to recognise the man and come forward with a name. 'We are still unsure of the motive behind the attack but what we do believe is that this was completely unprovoked. 'Officers have been speaking to local businesses and making enquiries but as yet the man remains unidentified and we are now appealing for anyone who can supply a name to call me or one of the team.'

"Katarina Marinkovic shakes her head in disbelief. She is in shock, struggling to come to terms with, not just the murder of neighbour Vesna Crnobrnja, but also the fact that neighbouring houses in Flame Tree Street, Casula have now played host to four deaths in recent times. 'This street - a plane crashed into one house, it crashed and two people died and then a man hung himself in a white house while it was getting built and now this happens, it's really upsetting,' she said. Scroll down for video . A street with a string of tragedies. Flame Tree Street in Casula has seen four deaths in separate incidents across three different homes in recent years . A 50-year-old man has been charged with the murder of Vesna Crnobrnja on Monday. He will appear by video link in Campbelltown Court on December 3 after being formally refused bail . Two light planes collided in mid-air above Flame Tree Street six years ago. Two female pilots were killed when their aircraft plummeted into the Casula home . Katarina Marinkovic is stunned at the sequence of events which had led to four deaths at three different homes on Flame Tree Street at Casula . This bizarre sequence of events began in 2008 when two light planes collided in mid-air above the south-western Sydney suburb and one came crashing down into the back of a home on Flame Tree Street. Mrs Marinkovic recoiled at the shock that a man had taken his own life inside another home which while it was being built. 'It's very sad, all really shocking, I couldn't sleep last night, I couldn't fall asleep,' she said. During brief court proceedings, Zoran Crnobrnja, 50, was formally refused bail in his absence. Barrister Bart Vasic leaves Liverpool Local Court after Zoran Crnobrnja was formally refused bail . 'We never really spoke we'd wave here and there, she worked at the chicken shop down the road and I would get food from there and she would serve me, she was lovely, she was a nice, nice lady,' said Mrs Marinkovic.

"Scientists have made some of the most precise measurements yet of the remnants of the universe’s oldest light. Known as the cosmic microwave background, researchers found the hidden ‘skeleton’ of the cosmos that first began to see it take shape just 380,000 years after the Big Bang. And mapping the universe in this way could help uncover some of its mysteries including dark matter and dark energy. Research led by University of California studied the early universe. The Polar consortium detected the polarisation of light 380,000 years after the Big Bang using microwave detectors on the Huan Tran Telescope in Chile's Atacama Desert (pictured) The findings were made by the Polarbear consortium led by Dr Adrian Lee from the University of California. Using microwave detectors mounted on the Huan Tran Telescope in Chile’s Atacama Desert, the team were able to make measurements of the universe. Polarbear measures remnant radiation from the Big Bang, which has cooled and stretched with the expansion of the universe to microwave lengths. This cosmic microwave background, the CMB, acts as an enormous backlight, illuminating the large-scale structure of the universe and carrying an imprint of cosmic history. Sensitive instruments called bolometers, located in telescopes, can record this light from the young universe. They record the direction of the light’s electric field and, in so doing, create a map of how light was once distributed in the universe. But of most importance was that the Polarbear team found ‘twists’ in this structure of the light from 380,000 after the Big Bang. This suggested it had been warped by mysterious entities such as dark matter and neutrinos. Their research is separate but similar to the Bicep2 results published earlier this year that found a signature of cosmic inflation. This is the remnant of the rapidly ballooning universe when it was just a fraction of a fraction of a second old. What the Polarbear team found was a specific ‘polarisation’ of the initial light in the universe. Polarisation in astronomy basically refers to the way in which light, in the form of waves, travels through the universe. B-mode polarisation, which was the type measured in this research by the Polarbear team, is associated with magnetic fields. The other type, E-mode, refers to electric fields. While E-mode polarisation contains some information, B-mode polarisation contains more, because photons carry this only if matter around the last point of scattering was unevenly distributed. Thus its discovery by the Polarbear team is deemed as being an important look into the early universe. After the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, the universe was so hot and dense that light bounced endlessly from one particle to another, scattering  and ionising any atoms that formed. Only when the universe was 380,000 years old was it sufficiently cool to allow an electron and a proton to form a stable hydrogen atom without being immediately broken apart. Suddenly, all the light particles - called photons - were set free. This latest finding reveals the hidden 'skeleton' of the universe 380,000 years after the Big Bang. Illustrated here is a separate image provided by the Illustris Collaboration earlier this year that shows dark matter density in the evolution of the universe . ‘The photons go from bouncing around like balls in a pinball machine to flying straight and basically allowing us to take a picture of the universe from only 380,000 years after the Big Bang,' said Dr Lee. ‘The universe was a lot simpler then: mainly hydrogen plasma and dark matter.’ These photons, which, today, have cooled to a mere 3 degrees Kelvin above absolute zero, still retain information about their last interaction with matter. Specifically, the flow of matter due to density fluctuations where the photon last scattered gave that photon a certain polarisation. And it was the remnants of these that were detected by the Polarbear team. ‘Think of it like this: the photons are bouncing off the electrons, and there is basically a last kiss, they touch the last electron and then they go for 14 billion years until they get to telescopes on the ground,’ Lee said. ‘That last kiss is polarising.’ Polarbear may also eventually confirm or refute the Bicep2 results, although so far it has focused on interpreting the polarisation pattern of the microwave background to map the distribution of matter back in time to the universe's inflationary period, 380,000 years after the Big Bang. Polarbear's approach, which is different from that used by Bicep2, may allow the group to determine when dark energy, the mysterious force accelerating the expansion of the universe, began to dominate and overwhelm gravity, which throughout most of cosmic history slowed the expansion.","Research led by University of California studied the early universe .

"Once nicknamed the ‘slave bracelet’, its design is rumoured to have been based on the medieval chastity belt into which men would lock their wives when they went to war. Yet this has done nothing to stop the rise of the bangle that has become the latest must-have trinket for a new generation of celebrities. The Cartier Love bracelet has graced the wrists of Hollywood actresses Lindsay Lohan and Katie Holmes, while last week Pippa Middleton was spotted in Cartier’s Bond Street store getting her 18-carat gold bangle replaced. Scroll down for video . The Cartier Love bracelet was launched in 1969 and was designed to be given to one's true love and screwed on to their wrist for all eternity . Chloe Green, the daughter of Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green, has no fewer than six, often wearing several at the same time. The upmarket jeweller, a favourite of the Duchess of Cambridge, launched its Love bangles in 1969. The bracelet was designed to be given to one’s true love and then screwed on to their wrist for all eternity. It consists of two C-shaped halves which are then secured using two working screws on either side. It is understood that 31-year-old Pippa, who is in a relationship with financier Nico Jackson, had lost or misplaced her original bangle when the screws came loose. A replacement screw costs as much as £245, while the bracelets themselves range from £4,450 to an eye-watering £39,900 for bespoke designs inlaid with diamonds – making them a powerful status symbol on a par with a Rolex watch. It is understood Pippa was so upset by the loss of her bracelet, she went straight to the brand’s Bond Street store to buy another one. According to a source, her replacement was a gift from the company. Lindsay Lohan, left, and Katie Holmes, right, are all fans of the bracelet, which ranges from £4,000 to £40,000 . Cilla Black was lucky too when her Love bracelet – given to her by her late husband Bobby – was one of the pieces burglars left behind when they raided her home. Tom Cruise bought an 18-carat gold Love bracelet as a ‘push present’ for his then wife Katie Holmes on the birth of their daughter Suri in 2006. Meanwhile, actress Elizabeth Hurley, who was then the face of Estee Lauder, was presented with one of the bracelets by the firm’s boss Leonard Lauder as a token of his affection. The bracelet, which this year celebrates its 45th birthday, was created by Cartier’s Italian designer Aldo Cipullo. He started working there in 1969, producing his iconic Love bracelet the same year. Cipullo had been fascinated by history and often produced work around legends and old practices. He was particularly interested in the story of men locking up their wives with iron chastity belts to ensure their fidelity while they were away on the battlefield. The designer is thought to have adopted the idea of being locked in a committed relationship in his Love bracelet design. In an interview at the time, Cipullo said: ‘Love has become too commercial, yet life without love is nothing – a fat zero. What modern people want are love symbols that look semi-permanent – or, at least, require a trick to remove. After all, love symbols should suggest an everlasting quality.’ When the bracelets were launched, Cartier enforced a rule that customers were not allowed to buy one for themselves. They could only make a purchase for somebody else – however, that is a rule that has since been abolished. Cartier presented the bangles to 25 well-known couples including, rather ironically, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, at a ceremony in its boutique in New York. Pippa Middleton, left, was spotted getting her bracelet fixed last week and Chloe Green, right, has no fewer than six . Each couple locked each other in before exchanging screwdrivers. To ensure that they were authentic to the last, Cartier last year lent the BBC a pink-gold Love bracelet, set with four diamonds, for its 2013 film Burton and Taylor starring Dominic West and Helena Bonham Carter. Soon Cartier found it could not keep up with production. Love bracelets were spotted on the wrists of Nancy and Frank Sinatra and later Joan Collins, Princess Diana, Jane Seymour, Elton John and more recently Jennifer Aniston, Angelina Jolie and model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. The Precious Love bracelet with diamonds was launched in 1979 followed by the Love ring, Love cufflinks and Love earrings. At one point the bracelet was so well known that it became a measure of one’s commitment. Asking one’s beau if he loved you enough to buy the Cartier Love bracelet was on a par with an engagement. Cartier currently lists 16 lockable bracelets on its website. Its classic design comes in yellow, pink or white gold, while more intricate designs feature yellow and pink sapphires, garnets and amethysts. The bracelets have appeared on the lists of top auction houses include Christie’s and Bonhams. In 1998, two gold Cartier bracelets belonging to the Duke of Windsor and Wallis Simpson were among the items in the 1998 Sotheby’s auction of the Royals’ private collections. The auction famously made more than three times the estimated value. Not that the bracelets are always for eternity. Tamara Ecclestone returned two diamond-encrusted Love bracelets she had bought for her then boyfriend Omar Khyami when he cheated on her in 2012. Mr Khyami had claimed a tape showing him in bed with another woman had been made before he met the daughter of Formula 1 billionaire, Bernie. But sources close to Miss Ecclestone believed she had ‘absolute proof’ this was not the case after spotting Mr Khyami wearing the two bracelets in the film. Others who are having second thoughts about being shackled to another needn’t worry. The bracelet can be removed using a special mini screwdriver which handily comes with every purchase.","Cartier launched Love bangles in 1969 - designed for one's true love .

"At the age of 18 Mez Gallifuoco’s dreams were shattered when she was told her future would be in a wheelchair and that she should never try and have children. Her immune system had started attacking her body's own central nervous system and she was losing feeling in her limbs. ‘I woke up and had pins and needles in my legs and progressively over a week it had reached my waist and I was completely numb,’ Mez, a consultant and founder of Little-Soul.com, told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I could run a knife across there, and couldn't feel hot or cold in the shower. I would burn myself and not realise.’ Scroll down for video . Mez Gallifuoco (right) and her father Salvatore Gallifuoco (left) did not know much about the disease when Mez was diagnosed with MS in 2005 . The Sydney teenager lost feeling in her legs and suffered severe side effects from her medication . Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease that attacks the central nervous system (the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves). The progress, severity and specific symptoms of MS cannot be predicted. MS is a lifelong disease for which a cause and cure are yet to be found; however, doctors and scientists are making discoveries about the treatment and management of MS every day. The visible and hidden symptoms of MS are unpredictable and vary from person to person and from time to time in the same person. However, symptoms can include difficulties walking, pain, dizziness, slurred speech, emotional and mood changes, memory problems and extreme tiredness. Mez had just struggled through her HSC exams, unable to hold her pen, when six months later the teen from Bondi, in Sydney’s eastern suburbs, received a shattering diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis in 2005. She knew nothing about the disease, other than from a readathon she did at school. ‘All I could think of was a wheelchair. The only association I had was a wheelchair,’ she explained. ‘You know it’s chronic and not something that can be healed.’ Her Italian businessman father, Salvatore Gallifuoco, described the moment he was first told his only daughter had MS. ‘The whole family was ringing and worried. No one knew what to expect. I was so worried about it and felt powerless to help my princess,’ he said. Now, almost ten years later, Mez has received the incredible news that her MS is in remission. After being diagnosed Mez, seen her at the age of 21, decided to learn about her disease and took up a science degree . Mez received news that her MS was in remission two months ago. In this photo she's hugging her mother Rosaria Gallifuoco after hearing the news . Mez says she was not given a cure or miracle treatment and her recovery seemed to surprise doctors. She believes the relationship she formed with her MS ultimately helped her overcome it. The 27-year-old, who has been MS free for two months, decided she was going to learn about her disease and signed up for a science degree at The University of New South Wales. She tried to go to a group session where there were other MS sufferers but found it ‘really sad and depressing’. ‘I remember consciously going I don’t want to be the victim in this, I really want to play the survivor. ‘I know it sounds dramatic but I mean I wanted to take a more active role in this and not be stuck with a death sentence,’ she reasoned. The average age to be diagnosed with MS is 30-32 so at 18 Mez was much younger than the other sufferers she was meeting. It took her about a year and a half to find a good neurologist. ‘Because I was so young they wouldn’t talk to me they would talk to my parents.’ Eventually she found one at St Vincent’s Hospital and started treatment at the age of 22 in the form of a  needle which she had to inject herself with daily. Mez, her best friends and her family did the MS Australia Fun Walk this year . Mez is now a consultant, blogger, photographer and has dabbled in modelling . She had to inject herself with daily with medication that altered the way her immune system functions . ‘It would take me about an hour to have the courage to put it in,’ Mez recalled. She said that the drug that she was putting into her body – Interferon – felt like it burned as it seeped into her blood. She found it hard to travel and ‘couldn’t go anywhere with it’ and there were massive side effects because she was so young. She would have fever and chills and throw up for two days afterwards. ‘I was doing uni at the time so my weeks just became shorter,’ she said. Interferon slowed down the rate of MS by 30 per cent. Then two years ago, thanks to medical advancements, a new MS drug was brought onto the market, called Tysabri – an antibody that affects the actions of the body's immune system – which slows down the rate by 70 per cent. Mez’s MS experience became far less invasive when she stopped having to inject herself. ‘A lot of my friends say to me ""I forget that you have it"",’ Mez said. Despite her MS, Mez took up the offer to go to New York to work for ten months . She continued to live her life as happily as she could and formed a relationship with her MS . At one point Mez’s MS spread from two lesions to 26 lesions and her legs started to buckle when she walked. ‘I got a lot of cognitive effects from it. I got really cloudy which is hard when you’re doing a science degree… at one point I couldn’t wear heels anymore, I kept falling,’ she remembered. Mez described how she formed a relationship with what was happening inside her body, lived really healthily and dealt with the psychological side of the illness. In May last year she was told it had spread throughout her whole entire spine but she went to New York for 10 months, came back and incredibly found she was in remission. ‘It never happens. My neurologist said “I don’t know how you are walking, you should not be walking with what you have”. Mez is now raising awareness for MS Research Australia and believes a cure for the disease is not far off . ‘I didn’t want to hate something inside me so I just tried to use it as information, I will slow down if I get a flare up. Stress is a massive trigger for MS,’ she explained. ‘There is no miracle drug – not yet anyway… But my body is acting like I never had it. Nerve tissues have regenerated.’ Mez is now raising awareness for MS Research Australia, which supports scientists who believe they are really close to finding a cure. Her results are also being used as a case study because doctors are so surprised by what has happened. ‘They want to monitor me but I feel good.’ Mez’s ten year MS journey coincides with a ground-breaking decade of research that has been carried out by MS Research Australia. According to MS Research Australia’s recently published Research Audit, MS affects more than 23,000 Australians and 2.3 million people worldwide. Worldwide, the average onset age is 30. People can be diagnosed at any age, although it is usually in early adulthood. Key milestones for MS Research: .","Mez Gallifuoco was diagnosed with MS, a chronic illness, at the age of 18 .

"A limited-edition watch designed to work in ‘outer space’ has been released by a Swiss company. There are 50 units of the HM6 Space Pirate watch being made, and its design is based on a spaceship piloted by fictional character Captain Future from a 1970s cartoon. Bu,t although it might boast an interesting design, space and watch enthusiasts alike might baulk at the asking price of £150,000 ($230,000). Scroll down for video . Swiss wathchmaker MB&F has created a futuristic limited edition watch (pictured). The HM6 'Space Pirate' (Horological Machine Number 6) is designed to operate in outer space. Each of the four corners is a 360° sphere tapped at the top and bottom with sapphire crystal domes . Shell: Ti-6Al-4V (Grade 5) titanium . Dimensions: 1.95 x 2.06 x 0.8 inches (49.5 x 52.3 x 20.4 mm) Number of components: 80 . Water resistance: 100 feet (30 metres) Features: Two spheres at the front of the watch display the hours and minutes, while two twin spherical turbines at the back regulate the winding system to reduce stress and wear. A sppecialised tourbillon timekeeping 'cage', found at the centre of the watch, ensures it works in zero-gravity. The entire watch is made of 475 individual components, 80 of which make up the case. It is also embedded with 68 jewels. The watch, created by Maximilian Busse from Swiss watchmaker MB&F and David Candaux Horlogerie Créative, has five distinct segments. It uses a technique known as tourbillon to make it able to counter the effects of gravity. This means it can be used even in a weightless environment, such as on board the ISS. Of course, astronauts on the ISS aren’t in zero-gravity, but their constant state of freefall towards Earth allows them to float around the station. The Space Pirate watch mounts the timekeeping element, namely the balance wheel, inside a rotating cage. This means that, if it were to be used on the ISS, the cage would constantly move in order to keep the time on the watch accurate. On the watch, the central sphere, which keeps track of the time, is capped at the top and bottom by transparent sapphire-crystal domes, as are the other four domes. The central portion of the watch also has a retractable dome that can protect the timekeeping elements from ultraviolet radiation - for those moments when the wearer hasn’t got the benefit of Earth’s atmosphere for protection. Two spherical segments at the front then rotate to display the hours and minutes. Two spheres at the front of the watch display the hours and minutes, while two twin spherical turbines at the back (seen at the bottom of the watch here) regulate the winding system to reduce stress and wear . The interior workings of the Space Pirate watch are shown on the left, including the semi-spheres that show the time, and keep the watch working.

"TV watchdog Ofcom has rejected complaints that comedian Ricky Gervais's use of the word 'mong' during a stand-up show was offensive. The Office star and controversial comedian claimed that Britain's Got Talent singer Susan Boyle looked like a 'mong' during his 'Science' live show on Channel 4 last year. During a tirade about the Scots singer in October, Gervais said: 'She would not be where she is today if it wasn’t for the fact that she looked like such a f*****g mong.' Controversy: Gervais, seen here in a picture posted on his Twitter feed, branded Susan Boyle a 'mong' and repeatedly used the term on the micro-blogging site last year . Outspoken: The comedian, pictured hosting the Golden Globes last week, was described as 'exploratory and subversive' in an Ofcom ruling today . 'When she first came on the telly, I went, ""Is that a mong?"" You all did.' The jibes saw charity bosses write to Gervais to demand he stop using the word, which they saw is a cruel nickname for Down's Syndrome sufferers. Ofcom launched an investigation, but today cleared Channel 4 of breaching guidelines on offensive content. The TV regulator ruled that although Gervais's comments could cause 'considerable offence', they were justified in the context of a late night comedy show. Ofcom ruled that Gervais's jibes towards Susan Boyle were 'justified in the context of provocative comedy' During the show, Gervais went on to say that he didn't mean Boyle had Down's Syndrome, and argued the word 'mong' was no longer associated with sufferers of the condition. Ofcom said that in the name of freedom of expression, no word was banned after the TV watershed. However, there must be a good reason for using language many people find offensive. The regulator's own research found that many people did not know of ‘mong’ came from the term ‘mongoloid’ – an offensive term for people with Down‟s syndrome – but it ‘could cause considerable offence to those who are aware of the association’. In its ruling, Ofcom said: 'We noted that the programme began at 22:35, more than an hour and a half after the watershed, and that therefore most viewers of the programme would have been expecting stronger and more challenging content. 'The late scheduling of the programme, . and its late night comedy context on Channel 4, meant that the majority . of the audience was likely to expect the exploratory and subversive . bent of the programme in general and of Ricky Gervais's humour in . particular. 'Offensive': Gervais's previous use of the word 'mong' saw him contacted by campaigners who demand he stop using the term . The comedian has insisted the meaning of the word 'mong' has changed over time . 'We also took . into account that Channel 4 brought the challenging nature of the . content to the attention of viewers with a warning at the start of the . programme, which stated that it would contain 'strong language and adult . humour'. 'We therefore concluded that several aspects of this content had the potential to cause considerable offence. 'However, on balance, this potential offence was justified by the context of this provocative comedy routine challenging the evolution of words, as broadcast with a warning as part of a late night comedy show on Channel 4.' The broadcasting regulator did, however, issue a warning to TV bosses about the use of the word 'mong'. Although Gervais claims 'mong' is no longer a derogatory term, the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) still classifies it as offensive: . Its entry states:'Mongol: A person with Down's syndrome. Now generally regarded as offensive.' The use of the word harks back to the implied similarity in appearance of those with Down's syndrome and the Mongol race of East Asia - who established an empire in much of Eurasia during the 13th century. Its un-PC usage is cited in the OED as far back as 1866: . 'I have for some time had my attention directed to the possibility of making a classification of the feeble-minded by arranging them around various ethnic standards. 'A very large number of congenital idiots are typical Mongols.' The citation is from none other than John Langdon Down - the man after whom Down's syndrome was named. It was Down's work at an asylum in Surrey in the late 1860s that led to the term 'Mongolian idiocy' being used to classify certain clinical cases. It was not until 1961 that the term Down's syndrome was first used, following consultation with genetics experts unhappy with the previous label. They said their research showed it had the potential to be highly offensive and 'great care' should be taken over its use. Gervais has been criticised by the Down Syndrome's Association for his repeated use of the word. The award-winning comedian and writer landed himself in hot water for a second time with his use of the word by repeatedly using the word 'mong' on his Twitter account and blog. After using the word on the mico-blogging site, Gervais was eventually questioned by Nicola Clark, a disability campaigner and mother of two disabled girls. Mrs Clark broke down in tears while discussing the row on Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show last October. Mrs Clark had wept while discussing the abuse directed at her daughters by people on the street using words like ‘mong’. Multi-millionaire Gervais went on to describe his use of 'mong' as 'naive' in an online conversation with Mrs Clark. Gervais then contacted Mrs Clark on Twitter to offer ‘a very public thank you’ for her ‘kind, rational and understanding words in private’ since the issue broke. Speaking about the controversy last year, Gervais said: 'I have used 'mong', but never to mean Down Syndrome and never would. 'The meaning of words change over time, 'gay' for example. 'The modern use of the word 'mong' means dopey or ignorant, it's in slang and urban dictionaries.' Channel 4 argued that Gervais was 'exploring the contemporary use of the word in a comedic context' and said he did not mean to suggest Boyle had a disability. After Gervais's use of the word 'mong' in October, Penny Green, director of Down's Syndrome charity Down's Heart Group, refuting his claim that the meaning of the word has changed. After learning of Ofcom's ruling, she told MailOnline today: It's very sad that in effect Ofcom is excusing Ricky Gervais because of the time the show was broadcast and a very loose warning about content and yet they issued a warning to TV bosses about the use of the word saying 'their research showed it had the potential to be highly offensive and 'great care' should be taken over its use.' 'It's almost like giving carte blanche to anyone to use offensive language directed at a particular group just as long as they do it at 'an appropriate time'. 'Why can't we just accept people for who they are?  And if we really can't cope with their differences (usually from fear of the unknown or outdated and unrealistic stories I might add), can't we just avoid them without feeling the need to publicly poke fun at and humiliate them.' A spokeswoman for Boyle refused to comment. Representatives for Ricky Gervais did not respond to requests for comment.","Regulator rules insult was not offensive 'in the context of late-night comedy'

"Controversial 'pick-up artist' Julien Blanc has issued a public apology for his offensive 'tips' after being called the 'most hated man in the world'. The 25-year-old Californian, who had his Australian visa cancelled by Immigration Minister Scott Morrison and is now facing bans from entering the UK, issued an apology during an interview on CNN. 'I just want to apologise to anybody that I have offended in any way. It was never my intention and I just want to put it out that I'm extremely sorry for everything that happened,' Blanc told CNN presenter Chris Cuomo. Scroll down for video . Californian 'pick-up artist' Julien Blanc issued a public apology for his offensive 'tips' during an interview . Guru: Mr Blanc (pictured in a Twitter photo) runs $3,000-a-head 'dating seminars' for men across the world . Blanc, whose infamous tips for unconfident men trying to socialise with women included choking them and forcing their faces into his crutch, went on to say: 'my intentions weren't ever bad'. 'That is not what I teach,' he said when confronted by pictures of him choking women. 'Those pictures there were a horrible, horrible attempt at humour and they were also taken out of context.' When questioned about a manipulated women's abuse chart that he posted to his Twitter page and called a 'checklist' for 'making her stay', Blanc again denied that it had anything to do with his teachings. The 25-year-old claimed that his teachings do not direct men to choke women and force their heads into their crotches . He said that a photograph of him choking a woman (pictured) was a 'a horrible, horrible attempt at humour' 'I thought mocking it would be funny but it wasn't and I regret putting that out,' he said. However, throughout the interview, Blanc's interviewer questioned him relentlessly and appeared unimpressed as he claimed his photos were 'taken out of context' and that 'you can make anything look bad in a picture'. The sentiments were echoed across social media where furious opponents of Blanc's teachings slammed the Californian for denying that he gave out the controversial advice. He also claimed that a chart that was posted to his Twitter account (pictured) that was originally designed to help women identify when they are being abused but was altered and called a 'checklist' for 'making her stay', was not part of his teachings . Jennifer Li, the founder of the original campaign against Blanc titled #TakeDownJulienBlanc, told Buzzfeed, 'he is sorry he got caught, not for what he has done. 'How can you say you do not teach this when the video shows him telling men that it's ok to force women's heads on his crotch?' Twitter user Polly Maeve agreed, writing: 'Sorry for causing offence IS NOT being sorry for, or taking ownership of, your actions.' An anonymous blogger who runs the website Tinders Finest Bachelors, and claims to have been verbally abused by Blanc on the dating app, has also dismissed his public apology. The blogger posted her alleged conversation with Blanc, in which he begged her for sex before writing 'you should be happy I'm acknowledging your existence you w****', on her popular Tumblr page. Twitter users slammed Blanc's apology, for denying that he gave out the controversial advice . 'There are hours of seminar footage where Julien encourages and instructs men to objectify and manipulate women,' she told BuzzFeed. 'There is video of him saying that when he takes something too far, he'll ""save"" the situation by saying ""just kidding"".' Dozens of petitions continue to appear online demanding that Blanc be refused entry into various countries including the UK, Japan and Belgium.","The Californian pick-up artist said it was never his intention to offend anyone during an interview on CNN .

"These are the stunning landscapes captured by a photographer who returned home to expose the beauty of Great Britain in autumn. Travelling across Britain, photographer Julian Elliott, originally from Salisbury, began his adventure in the middle of September and finished it this month. It required plenty of patience as a great deal of his time was spent watching the weather and waiting for clear skies. Scroll down for video . Photographer Julian Elliott captured this stunning scene at dawn on Mam Tor in the Peak District, Derbyshire . Mr Elliott began his began his adventure in the middle of September and finished it this month (pictured: Pont Fawr Bridge in Llanrwst, Wales) He captured incredible scenes in Dorset, Dartmoor, Devon, Sussex, Wiltshire, Scottish Highlands, Peak District National Park, Brecon Beacons, Snowdonia and the Yorkshire Dales. The 39-year-old photographer, now of Tours, France, said: ‘In some cases, the images were difficult to get. The weather is very fickle, as anyone who lives in the UK knows. ‘I had originally planned to capture the autumn colour across Britain during early November, but during a visit in mid-September it was obvious that autumn had arrived early in some place, with the leaves already changing.’ After moving to France four years ago, the natural beauty of Britain has remained close to Julian's heart. Photographer Julian Elliott captured this incredible scene as leaves changed colour at Rydal Water in the Lake District, Cumbria . Mr Elliott spent a lot of time waiting for clear skies as he visited places such as the Sgwd Gwladus waterfall in the Brecon Beacons, Wales . The autumn weather tightens its grip over the Brecon Beacons mountain range in South Wales . He said: ‘I used to visit Snowdonia every year with my grandparents; to see it again through the eyes of adult was great and it's somewhere I want to go back to. ‘Outside of this, the Galloway Forest was also a highlight. It seems to be one of those places where you can spend a whole day and not see anyone.’ He decided to pursue a career in landscape photography because of his love of the outdoors.

Mr Elliott's journey across Britain took him to this incredible landscape at Loch Garry in the Highlands of Scotland . Julian added: ‘My message would be for people to appreciate more of what is around them. ‘Not living in the country anymore I'm not always in the position where I can jump in the car to get images of these beautiful places. ‘British people are lucky as they are never that far from beautiful scenery.’","Julian Elliott, originally from Salisbury, began his adventure in the middle of September and finished it this month .

"Millions of Americans, Australians and Canadians will be charged £10 to come to Britain, under plans set out by Labour to pay for extra border staff. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said 1,000 extra border guards could be hired by charging 5.5 million visitors from 55 countries – including more than 2 million from the US, Australia and Canada. Currently visitors from a host of friendly countries can travel to Britain to work, study or go on holiday without a visa. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Labour would introduce a £10 charge on millions of oversees visitors . But Labour want to include these countries in the Government’s ‘electronic visa waiver’ scheme – a system of fast-track permission to enter the UK – charging each visitor £10. Currently only the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman are covered by the  programme – which allows visitors into Britain for up to six months. The Tories have today attacked the Labour proposal – claiming that bringing the US, Australia and Canada into the visa-waiver scheme would cost millions in unnecessary bureaucracy. The £10 charge is a similar sum to what the US charges Britons to go to the States on holiday. Labour said tourism experts did not anticipate it would have any impact on the numbers choosing to travel to Britain. Regular increases in the cost of general visas since 2010 - from £68 to £83 - had not resulted in reduced visitor numbers from countries not benefiting from waiver arrangements, aides said. As many as 5.5 million travellers a year will be subject to the new fee - more than two in five of those from America, with Australians and Canadians the next largest groups. Mrs Cooper said that, under a Labour government, 1,000 extra immigration staff would be recruited to protect Britain's porous borders . ‘Enforcement has got worse in the last five years,’ Ms Cooper said in a speech. ‘Under Theresa May, basic checks are just not being done, and that is undermining confidence in the whole system. ‘The number of people stopped and turned away at the border has halved. A smaller proportion of people absconding at the border are being found. And we recently discovered 175,000 failed asylum seekers may not be removed because the Department has 'limited resources'.’ Theresa May has claimed Labour's visa-waiver charge would only hire 59 extra border guards . She pointed to a ‘serious and growing problem’ of immigrants taking increasingly desperate steps to get to the UK from Calais, including ‘awful cases of young men camping by the roadside then leaping onto the wheel arches of passing lorries, only to be crushed and killed’. Addressing the wider issue, she said: ‘Too often the debate about immigration becomes polarised and unhealthy. ‘On the one hand we now have an arms race of rhetoric involving the Tories and Ukip over immigration. Ukip are exploiting peoples' fears, fuelling anxiety and division, and David Cameron is racing to catch up. ‘On the other hand some people seem to think talking about immigration at all is a problem and they dismiss people's genuine concerns. ‘Both sides shout at each other. Neither are right. And most people don't agree with either of them. ‘In a shouting match, sensible voices are sometimes not heard. That's why Labour needs to set out practical reforms as part of a sensible debate on the changes we need.’ Labour wants to convert all visa waiver arrangements to the electronic version introduced this year for passport holders from the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman for visa-free stays of up to six months. Home Secretary Theresa May said Labour's proposed charge would apply to only around 230,300 people, and could pay for only 59 border staff. ‘Even before Yvette Cooper's speech, this announcement has unravelled completely,’ she said. ‘Labour are pretending they can hire 1,000 more immigration staff when their funding model would raise enough money for only 59 new staff members. And as their secret spending review contains plans to cut the Home Office budget, they are being especially dishonest. ‘And what's more, by relaxing the Government's immigration reforms, Labour would take Britain backwards and risk a surge in both legal and illegal immigration. ‘This disastrous policy launch shows Labour aren't remotely ready for the responsibility of government.’","Party wants 1,000 extra border guards hired by charging 5.5 million visitors .

"House prices are rising faster than at any point since before the financial crash, making it even harder for people to get on to the housing ladder. Average property values soared by 12.1 per cent in the year to September, a level not seen since July 2007, according to new figures. And prices paid by first-time buyers are growing even faster, up 13.3 per cent in a year – the highest since March 2005. Prices rose by 12.1 per cent in the year to September this year, the highest level since July 2007 . Prices for first-time buyers were up 13.3 per cent in a year, the highest annual price increase since March 2005 . In recent months there have been claims that the property market was cooling. There were also doubts that areas outside London would see prices rocket by the same dramatic levels seen in the capital. But latest data from the Office for National Statistics show double-digit growth in four regions of the UK. The ONS said house prices are continuing to 'increase strongly across the UK, with prices in London again showing the highest growth'. Values in London have increased by 18.8 per cent over the last year to reach £508,000 on average. The East saw the next highest annual price growth, with values there lifting by 13.4 per cent over the 12 months, which is the strongest year-on-year increase seen in the East since August 2003. The average house price across the UK stood at £273,000 in September, which is £1,000 lower than an all-time high recorded in August. But it is still nearly 12 per cent higher than typical values during the previous peak of the market in 2008, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. A typical first-time buyer faces having to pay 13.3 per cent more to get on to the property ladder than they did a year ago. This is the highest annual price increase for first-time buyers since March 2005. Someone climbing the first rung of the property ladder now needs to pay £209,000 on average. The average price of a home in London is £507,833, almost double the UK average of £272,952 . Prices rose by 18.8 per cent in London, 13.4 per cent in the East of England and 11.6 per cent in the South East . Campbell Robb, chief executive of charity Shelter, said: 'Despite talk of a cooling market, these new figures show yet another rise in house prices and therefore yet another rise in the number of young people and families left priced out of a home of their own. 'Average house prices in England are now almost 10 times the average wage. Even if they stop increasing at the astronomical rates we've seen over the past year, buying a home is still a pipe-dream for those on average incomes, who remain stuck in the 'rent trap', unable to save for a deposit. 'The only way to bring home ownership back within reach of ordinary people is for politicians to commit to build more genuinely affordable homes.' However, there are signs that the pace of house price growth is softening. The ONS said that in a number of regions, including London, prices have fallen back from the record levels seen in August. On a month-on-month basis, prices across the UK increased by 0.5 per cent between August and September, which is a smaller uplift than a 0.8 per cent monthly rise recorded in August. Over the last year, prices have increased by 12.5 per cent in England to reach £285,000, by 5.8 per cent in Wales to reach £172,000, by 7.6 per cent in Scotland to reach £197,000, and by 10.9 per cent in Northern Ireland to reach £143,000. House prices in England and Scotland remain above their pre-financial crisis peaks of 2008 but have dipped slightly compared with their levels in August. Values in Northern Ireland are still sitting 45 per cent below their pre-financial crisis high, while those in Wales are just below their previous peak, which was recorded in January 2008, the ONS said. Toughened mortgage lending rules came into force across the industry in April under the Mortgage Market Review (MMR), which has caused some disruption to the market. But in recent weeks, lenders have unleashed some of their lowest ever mortgage rates on to the market as they look to meet end-of-year targets. Swap rates, which influence how lenders price their mortgages, have also been falling. Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said the ONS figures show 'there is still plenty of momentum left in the market'. He said: 'Swap rates remain low and lenders are keen to make up for lost ground caused by implementing the Mortgage Market Review. As a consequence, there are some excellent fixed and tracker rates available. 'With the spring likely to be a challenge for the housing market ahead of the general election, lenders will continue offering fantastic deals to entice buyers and those remortgaging.' Despite skyrocketing house prices, there are some steps you can take to keep a lid on the cost of buying a house. For a start, getting the right mortgage is essential to making sure buying a home is as affordable as possible.

"It is one of the country's most recognizable sights and a building synonymous with American democracy. Now a stunning new timelapse video has put a new twist on the famous view of Washington's Capitol dome - showing the landmark as it is dressed from top to bottom in scaffolding for its first renovation in more than 50 years. The hugely complicated project involves removing several floral displays and pillars to be taken away for repair, while the 290ft high dome will be made watertight and 1,300 cracks in its cast iron shell repaired. Scroll down for video . Capitol dome pictured as it is surrounded by scaffolding and illuminated by 720 LED lights in the video . The new video - filmed over the course of several weeks - shows the structure's exterior as scaffolding is slowly pieced together at its base. Mostly undertaken at night, the scaffolding work continues to build up around the building until it reaches the Statue of Freedom at its peak. The footage is made all the more spectacular by the 720 LED construction lights installed for contractors to continue working on the job throughout the night. Building work is expected to continue for two years, with much of it carried out on nights and weekends to minimize disruptions to Congress and sightseeing tours. It is hoped the $60million project will preserve the building for future generations, as well as water proofing it following damage caused by roosting birds. The cornerstone of the building was laid in 1793 by George Washington himself and was then worked on by doctor and part-time architect William Thornton who placed a shallow dome between the North Senate wing and the South House wing. Scaffolding surrounds the bottom of the building as workers begin preparing for the renovations . Illuminated by hundreds of lights, it continues building up around the entirety of the 290ft high building . It finishes only when it has surrounded the building and reaches the Statue of Freedom at the dome's peak . Construction then crawled along under the watchful eye of several different architects before much of their work was undone by British soldiers in 1814 who set fire to both the Capitol building and the White House. Fortunately a rain storm stopped the building from being completely destroyed and construction was eventually 'finished' in 1826. Building work continued to enlarge the Capitol from 1850 and it was architect Thomas U. Walter who designed the cast iron dome to sit between new enlarged chambers, with work finishing in 1868.","Video shows dome as it undergoes first renovation in more than 50 years .

Ms de la Rosa, who is an MP in the Mexican city of Chihuahua, has denied she was dressed as Braun and said her costume was in fact of Greta Garbo . She said: 'I absolutely reject that I was there at the Halloween party as Eva Braun. 'My costume was supposed to be Greta Garbo. Of course it's great to wake up to find you're suddenly famous but I'm sorry to disappoint all those people who say anything different and in fact it isn't true. 'It would almost be funny if it wasn't tragic because there are so many more important things to deal with in Chihuahua than a costume at a Halloween party and whether or not it was Eva Braun or Greta Garbo. 'I don't support the Nazis and if there is anything from Germany that I can be accused of liking, it's their football which I supported during the World Cup.' Likeness? Adolf Hitler and his mistress Eva Braun pictured while dining . Ms de la Rosa has said she went to the party dressed as film legend Greta Garbo (file picture) PAN spokesman, Alfredo Pinera, said the . the sharing of the photos was a PR stunt by party rivals at PRI as part . of a bid to gain more votes in the next election in 2015. He said: 'The pictures were taken out of context and designed to damage the image of these young politicians.' Ceballos declined to comment on the pictures but a friend confirmed that they were taken at a Halloween party and repeated the suspicion that rival politicians had leaked them to the media to damage the reputation of his party. He said he felt Ceballos dressing up with a Hitler-style moustache and cropped hair, and also with a military costume similar to the one worn by Hitler, including a swastika, was appropriate for a Halloween party.","Pictures show Manuel Escobedo Ceballos and party colleague Karla de la Rosa at Halloween party .

"Purity balls, in which a girl pledges to remain ‘pure’ until her wedding day, symbolically ‘marries’ God, and promises her father that she will remain a virgin until she's a wife, have become a phenomenon in America, now taking place in 48 out of the 50 states. The balls resemble giant wedding ceremonies, with the girls - all around the age of 12 - wearing white gowns and dancing with their fathers who promise to ‘protect’ their daughter’s chastity. During the ceremony, fathers present their daughters with purity rings, which they wear to symbolise their commitment to virginity. Ron Johnson, who is the head pastor at the Living Stones Church, kneels to present one of his younger daughters with her purity ring in the new documentary exploring the growing phenomenon of father daughter purity balls . Dancers carry a cross into the ballroom at the annual Father-Daughter Purity Ball in Colorado Springs, Colorado in 2007. Balls now take place in 48 states in the US, and in 17 countries worldwide . In the movement purity means no sexual contact of any kind, including kisses, until after marriage. One of the largest father-faughter purity balls - which is the subject of a Nightline Prime investigation - has been held for 14 consecutive years in Broadmoor Hotel in Colorado Springs. The event sees upwards of 60 fathers pledging to ‘protect their daughter’s choices for purity'. Fathers taking part are expected to sign a ‘purity covenant’ in which they, as ‘High Priest of their home and family’ pledge ‘before God to cover my daughter as her authority and protection in the area of purity’ The daughters silently commit to live pure lives before God through the symbol of laying down a white rose at the cross, before engaging in a wedding-type dance with their father. An unidentified father and daughter kneel at a cross after the girls lay white roses symbolising their commitment to purity at a ball . Ron Jonson places the ring on the forth finger of his daughters left hand - her wedding finger . A new documentary follows two families who are taking part in this ritual; the Wilsons, whose father Randy is one of the founders of the father daughter balls, and the Johnsons from Indiana. While all seven of the Wilson children are home schooled, socialising mainly with other members of their church community, the Johnson children attend a regular high school. But while they might be exposed to normal teenage behaviour at school, at home they have the message of purity enforced by father Ron, who is the head pastor at the Living Stones Church. One scene sees Ron kneeling in front of one of his younger daughter, gifting her with her purity ring. ‘One of the things you’ve been asking daddy about is “when am I going to get my purity ring?” ‘One of things I think it’s important to remember is this is your desire to do it the Lord's way and really save yourself from kissing lots of toads along the way and wait for your prince charming to come along,' he says. 'You keep this on your finger and as this point you are married to the Lord and your father is your boyfriend,' Ron explains in the new documentary . A young girl signs the purity covenant as a witness: It states that her father, as High Priest of the household, will now protect her virginity . A father presents his daughter with her ring: Randy Wilson founded the first Father Daughter Ball in 1998 . Brandishing a gold ring, Ron continues: ‘This is just a reminder that keeping yourself pure is important. So you keep this on your finger and from this point you are married to the Lord and your father is your boyfriend.’ He then places the ring on the forth finger of his daughter's left hand – her wedding finger. The concept of purity pledges exists in in over 17 countries and across America, blossoming from the original purity movement that began in the USA in the 1980s. Adolescent members of church groups began taking vows of abstinence and wearing rings to symbolise their commitment as a backlash to the perceived sexual liberation of the past decades and the growing AIDS epidemic. They soon began wearing rings to symbolise their commitment, but the idea of girls giving their virginity to their father to safeguard until marriage, and the ceremonial purity balls, developed much later in alliance with Evangelical church movements. Watch the full story on “Nightline Prime,” Saturday, March 22 at 9 p.m. ET. I ………’s father, choose before God to cover my daughter as her authority and protection in the area of purity. I will be pure in my own life as a man, husband and father. I will be a man of integrity and accountability as I lead, guide and pray over my daughter and my family as the High Priest in my home. This covering will be used  by God to influence generations to come.","Purity balls now take place in 48 states in the US, and in 17 countries .

"Marks and Spencer has been criticised for selling a range of body toning creams called ‘Fat Girl Slim’. The products, including anti-cellulite cream and a stomach-toning gel called ‘six-pack’, have been accused of targeting 'insecure women' by campaigners in Brighton, West Sussex. M&S insisted the name, which is by independent firm Bliss, was simply a light-hearted play on the name of DJ Fatboy Slim, aka Norman Cook. Complaints: Marks and Spencer has come under fire for stocking a 'sexist' range of beauty products by another firm called Fat Girl Slim. Resident Frances Joseph said: 'I'm pretty shocked and disappointed' Variety: The products include a stomach toning gel called 'six pack' and a moisturiser called 'arm candy' But a shopper lodged a formal complaint with the manager of M&S's Western Road store in Brighton, citing the rate of eating disorders among young girls. Others urged the firm to stop stocking the goods. Brighton resident Frances Joseph, 41, urged customers to sign a petition which was started more than a year ago calling on Bliss to end its range entirely. She said: 'Many of us agree that this is deeply inappropriate branding for a cosmetics range. 'I’m pretty shocked and disappointed that M&S of all people would choose to stock this brand. 'There’s a clear implication that tummy cream will help to give you a six-pack, another product will give you toned arms and so on. 'They are overtly targeting insecure young women. Ms Joseph said: 'There’s a clear implication that tummy cream will help to give you a six-pack, another product will give you toned arms and so on. They are overtly targeting insecure young women. It's exploitative' M&S responded on Twitter: 'This is part of our Bliss beauty range; the products play on the popular DJ's name and aren't intended to cause offence'. Bliss, which produces the range, has been asked for comment . 'It’s really exploitative, dangerous and sad.' The products are also available from Bliss' website and include a moisturiser called Armcandy for £34 and a 'lean machine' for £120. Ms Joseph also complained to Marks and Spencer on Twitter. The firm responded: 'This is part of our Bliss beauty range; the products play on the popular DJ's name and aren't intended to cause offence.' A spokesman later said: 'This product range is part of independent beauty brand Bliss and is not intended to cause offence to our customers.' According to its website, Bliss began in 1996 with a spa in New York and later started marketing its treatments online and in shops. Its Fat Girl Slim range is thought to have existed for at least three years. Bliss has been contacted for comment.","Products by beauty firm Bliss include anti-cellulite cream and toning gel .

"Gazing suggestively at the camera, Georgia May Jagger’s modelling campaign for Just Cavalli perfume certainly looks provocative. However, it’s not the 22-year-old’s sultry pose that has triggered controversy, but the H-like symbol on her wrist. The advert featuring the model daughter of Mick Jagger, part of a campaign by Italian fashion house Roberto Cavalli, has been singled out by followers of a branch of Islam, who said it ‘cheapens’ and ‘degrades’ one of its holiest symbols. Scroll down for video . Controversial: The Just Cavalli campaign sees Georgia May Jagger, 22, with an ornate H-like symbol on her wrist, and has prompted demonstrations by Sufi Muslims in London . The pictures of Georgia May – daughter of the Rolling Stones frontman, 70, and model Jerry Hall, 57 – have prompted demonstrations by Sufi Muslims in London, outside Harrods, as well as in Dusseldorf, Germany, and Los Angeles, since they were first released in the middle of last year. The campaign – put together by Italian fashion house Roberto Cavalli to promote a designer fragrance – shows Miss Jagger with an ornate H-like symbol on her skin. It’s similar to a sign Sufis use to refer to Allah and representatives of the community have said it is ‘heartbreaking’ to see it used to make money. There are an estimated 500,000 adherents of Sufism worldwide and they are demanding the symbol, which they have previously had trademarked, be removed from the adverts. American student Nasim Bahadorani, one of the protest organisers, said: ‘To use something that means so much to us for corporate profit cheapens our sacred symbol. It’s disrespectful, offensive and degrading. Protest: Sufi Muslims claim the Italian design house has inappropriately used a symbol sacred to practitioners of their mystical faith and have protested on several locations, such as outside Harrods in London . ‘We have this sign that to us represents blessed peace. It’s a refuge. To see it disgraced like this for a company to make money is heartbreaking.’ Roberto Cavalli, which has used the image in campaigns since 2011, claims the symbols are not the same. It is a stance supported by the EU, which last month rejected a request by Sufi groups to ban the company from using the sign. Same, same, but different: Italian fashion designer Roberto Cavalli has been using the image in campaigns since 2011 . A spokesman for the fashion house said they are ‘deeply saddened by the distress expressed by’ the Sufi community but that they hope the EU ruling will ‘convince the Sufist religion of the complete good faith and the groundlessness of their requests’. Despite the ruling, campaigners have kept up the pressure on social media using the hashtag ‘TakeOffJustLogo’ and have singled out Miss Jagger’s campaign, which includes a video where the model refers to the symbol as a ‘snakebite’ and a ‘sign of seduction’. In a video produced by Sufi activists, which has been watched more than 12,000 times on YouTube, they accuse Robert Cavalli of ‘tearing communities apart’. They pose the questions: ‘How long should people wait for action to be taken against the injustices witnessed around the world? ‘How long should we allow and tolerate Cavalli’s vindictive attack on faith by supporting and encouraging mistreatment of faith?’ This is not the first time Roberto Cavalli has run into trouble over the use of religious symbols. Ten years ago, they made a line of bikinis which depicted Hindu gods. The swimwear was stocked by Harrods but was pulled off the shelves after a backlash from faith groups. The fashion house apologised at the time and said any offence was unintentional. Miss Jagger has also modelled for brands including Chanel, Versace and Vivienne Westwood and appeared in the London Olympics Opening Ceremony as one of the representatives of British fashion, alongside Naomi Campbell, 44, and Kate Moss, 40 .","Roberto Cavalli has been using sign in his campaign since 2011 .

"Guilty: Charles Napier admitted 28 indecent assault charges and one indecency offence on a child . The half-brother of a senior Conservative MP pleaded guilty today to a string of historical sex offences on young boys. Charles Napier, 67, who is related to Maldon MP John Whittingdale, admitted 28 indecent assault charges and one indecency offence on a child at London's Southwark Crown Court. Napier, of Newland in Sherborne, Dorset, admitted abusing 21 boys under the age of 16 between September 1967 and April 1972. Wearing glasses and dressed in a checked shirt with a tweed blazer, Napier said ‘guilty’ as the court clerk read each of the charges to him. The court heard he faces a further two separate indecent assault charges involving two other boys, for which he has yet to enter pleas. Napier was remanded in custody as Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith adjourned sentencing to December 23. The judge said: ‘It will enable those victims who wish to be here to be alerted and they can be here.’ Mr Whittingdale's office said he would not comment when contacted by MailOnline today. One charge involved a boy who was indecently assaulted on eight occasions by Napier between September 1969 and April 1972. The indecency offence involved a child who was forced to commit a sex act on Napier, the court heard. Napier was arrested last year under Operation Cayacos, a strand of a wider investigation launched following claims by MP Tom Watson. In 2012 Mr Watson used parliamentary privilege to claim that a file of evidence used to convict Peter Righton of importing child pornography in 1992 contained ‘clear intelligence’ of a sex abuse gang. He wrote to Scotland Yard, who launched criminal investigation Operation Fairbank, which has since spawned two more inquiries - Fernbridge, which is looking at claims linked to the Elm Guest House in Barnes, south west London, in the 1980s, and Cayacos. Related: Napier - who is the half-brother of senior Conservative MP John Whittingdale (left) - was arrested last year. It was under a strand of a wider investigation launched following claims by MP Tom Watson (right) When his half-brother was charged, Mr Whittingdale said: ‘I am aware that my half-brother has been charged with an offence alleged to have occurred over 35 years ago. ‘I have no knowledge of this, particularly as I had only just left school at that time. However, obviously I recognise that this is a serious matter and that the law must take its course.’","Charles Napier, 67, of Dorset, is related to Maldon MP John Whittingdale .

"Gareth Bale has dismissed speculation over a transfer to Manchester United and insists his relationship with Real Madrid team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo is as strong as ever. The Welsh forward said that he has several years left on his Madrid deal and tried to put to bed rumours that he wasn't happy in the Spanish capital. Bale spoke on Cadena SER radio show 'El Larguero' on Tuesday night, where host Jose Ramon de la Morena described him as 'shy, introverted and simple'. Gareth Bale was speaking on Spanish radio station Cadena Ser on Tuesday night . Gareth Bale says his relationship with star Real Madrid team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo hasn't changed . Bale was called a 'ball hog' earlier in the season after not passing to Ronaldo during a game with Espanyol . When asked about the recent allegations that he was selfish for not passing to Ronaldo when through on goal, Bale replied: 'All I can remember is going for the ball and feeling very focused on trying to score. I didn't see him, I think it would have been a difficult pass. I haven't spoken to Cristiano about not passing the ball. 'I don't know how much importance was given to it (by the media) but I'm sure people talk a lot about it. But it happens all the time on the football pitch in every team. 'We didn't speak about it at all. What happens on the pitch stays on the pitch and there's nothing personal after.' Bale was whistled by the Bernabeu crowd after the incident, despite being the man who won them the Copa del Rey against Barcelona and scored a crucial goal in their Champions League triumph last May. However, not passing to Ronaldo followed a similar incident where he failed to set up French striker Karim Benzema, and the fans did not let him off the hook. However, the 25-year-old insisted he loves playing at the Santiago Bernabeu. Bale and Ronaldo celebrate after the latter scored against Getafe at the Alonso Perez stadium in January . Bale: 'I feel happy, I feel the love from the crowd. I want to show them what I can do on the football pitch.' 'I feel like I'm doing well on the pitch, I score goals, give assists, play each game in my way, it's how I like it,' he said. 'Yeah, I feel happy, I feel the love from the crowd. I want to show them what I can do on the football pitch and win as many trophies as I can.' 'The fans are amazing. I love playing at home, at the Bernabeu, and trying to score more goals, it's what I love to do. It's really exciting to play at home and to score goals.' Bale has 36 goals in 72 games for Real Madrid, with 25 of those coming in 43 league games, but some have suggested he is looking for an exit route to Old Trafford. But the Los Blancos star - and the most expensive player in the world - said, when asked if it was possible he could leave: 'For me, no. I've done an interview recently crushing the rumours that I'm not happy here. I've got four and a half more years to go on the contract.' The host questioned Bale about the general perception that he prefers to stay in, rather than go out and enjoy himself in Madrid. However, the Welshman said that he did enjoy going out but tries to do it secretly so he can live his life in peace. 'I go out for food quite a lot but try and hide it, and go under the radar,' he said. 'I like to go out with my family and friends and try to live life as normal. 'I've been there (Gran Via, a main street in Madrid) a few times with family and friends, trying to keep a low profile, wearing a hat. It's nice to come out and experience parts of Madrid.' With Ronaldo set to be suspended for two games or more after being sent off against Cordoba, Bale may have the opportunity to play on the left, where he did for Tottenham. Bale celebrates after scoring against Cordoba - he could now get a run in the team on the left wing . Ronaldo says he tries to 'keep a low profile' in Madrid but also attempts to see the sights . Former Tottenham star Bale: 'I used to actually like Arsenal a lot. Therry Henry and Vieira were amazing.' But he said that he is happy to play wherever manager Carlo Ancelotti requires him to. 'The manager picks the team,' he explained. 'I enjoy playing anywhere across the front line, on the right, on the left, in the centre.' Much of the rest of the interview focused on more trivial affairs, with Bale admitting that he has a golf handicap of eight, and that he used to love watching Zinedine Zidane and Ronaldo play for Real Madrid back when he was a boy. However, one line may upset Tottenham fans hoping that Bale may return to White Hart Lane one day. As Theo Walcott had claimed a few years ago, Bale's blood bleeds red - red for Arsenal. 'I used to actually like Arsenal a lot,' he admitted. 'But when I went to Tottenham I went away from Arsenal. Thierry Henry and Patrick Vieira were amazing footballers.'","Gareth Bale was speaking on Spanish radio station Cadena Ser on Tuesday .

"Two friends have been branded racist after 'blacking up'  as tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams for a carnival parade. Kevin Stevens, 50, a local pub landlord, and his friend Jason Luke, 31, a builder, covered themselves in dark fake tan, brown face paint and afro wigs to join a tennis-themed carnival float. They  put on women's sports gear and were photographed posing enthusiastically with tennis rackets at the procession in Truro last weekend. Mr Stevens also sported a pair of fake breasts for the event. 'Inappropriate': Publican Kevin Stevens, left, and builder Jason Luke, right, were criticsed for their costumes at Truro Carnival in Cornwall. Mr Stevens is dressed as Venus Williams and Mr Luke as her sister Serena . 'Stereotype': Mr Stevens, posing above in Truro, was criticised by the Council for Racial Equality . 'I don't get it': Mr Luke, pictured, has said that he doesn't understand the criticism levelled at his outfit . Since the event they have been lambasted by spectators and carnival organisers, who called their costumes 'inappropriate', 'out-of-date and offensive'. The pair have denied that they are racist and apologised for any offence - though one of the two said he 'doesn't get the racial side of it' and characterised the criticism as 'political correctness gone mad.' Sara Batchelor, 33, who watched the carnival with her nine-year-old son, said: 'That sort of caricature went out in the 70s. I didn't realise people still did that. It's out of date and offensive.' 'Tennis stars': Mr Stevens and Mr Luke were part of a carnival float linked to a local pub, and were raising money for charity . Truro residents took to the carnival's Facebook page to complain. Andrew Harris asked: 'Why didn't somebody point out to the white man blacked up as Venus Williams that it was not funny or acceptable?' Dean Harvey, from the Council for Racial Equality in Cornwall, said: 'The whole concept of blackened face is steeped in racial prejudice and stereotype from minstrels to golliwogs. 'It is not just a bit of fun, it is offensive to people of all ethnicities and it's time we moved on from this. 'These two guys were not representative of Cornwall, only unfortunately serving to remind us of times gone by that we should acknowledge and move on from.' Carnival organisers banned pictures of the men from the Facebook page and the chairman of the event's committee, Claire Arymar, has spoken with Mr Stevens, who runs the Miners Arms pub in nearby Redruth. New rules: Carnival organisers have promised to vet each costume next year to avoid a repeat incident . Concern: Many who went to watch the carnival, which took place on Saturday, later complained online . Mrs Arymar said: 'It was inappropriate and had I seen them at the beginning of the carnival I would never have let them go. 'I don't think it was their intention to offend people but it was ill-thought-out.' She added that she will personally check each person's costume next year. However,  Mr Luke today defended his choice of costume, which he was wearing to raise money for charity. He told MailOnline: 'I'm deeply upset by the story - at the end of the day we were trying to support a local carnival that had died a death and we're trying to revive. 'We're trying to raise a bit of money for children with cancer - a whole bunch of us went as famous tennis players and I really don't see the issue. 'Quite often me might do things a bit close to the bone - but in this case it didn't even enter my head. I don't get it.' 'Like something from the 70s': Truro locals complained that the pair should have known better than to don the racially-sensitive costumes . 'We put brown face paint on ourselves - I wonder if the A-Team had come through behind us with a Mr T they would have been singled out as well. 'I don't get the racial side of it - we didn't set out to offend anyone... It's political correctness gone mad in my opinion.' When asked about the costumes Mr Stevens said: 'I have upset people and I am very sorry, all the guys are devastated and myself especially because I have black friends. 'I don't want anybody looking at us and thinking we are racists because that's not the type of people we are. 'We never set out to upset anybody. I didn't know we were doing anything untoward. 'From my heart, we will genuinely learn from this.'","Kevin Stevens, 50, and Luke Jason, 31, dressed as tennis stars for carnival .

"BBC commentator Mark Lawrenson has come under fire for a 'sexist' comment made during the Argentina versus Switzerland World Cup game. Switzerland striker Josip Drmic's weak shot at goal during their round of 16 clash with Argentina on Tuesday evening prompted Lawrenson to state Drmic 'should have put a skirt on'. Lawrenson's comment caused a storm on social media and has triggered 172 angry complaints to the BBC with claims it was offensive and sexist. BBC commentator Mark Lawrenson made the 'sexist' comment after Switzerland's Josip Drmic's weak shot, right, during his team's knockout match against Argentina two nights ago . Unhappy listeners were quick to voice their disdain with his quip, made during live commentary, and took to Twitter to voice their anger. Mark Batham tweeted: 'Wow. Just watching back ARG v SWI. Unbelievable casual sexism by Mark Lawrenson. Unacceptable @BBCSport.' Holly Evans said: 'Wow. Some rather extreme sexism from Mark Lawrenson. Rather offensive, actually.' Others directed their anger towards the BBC, with one listener writing it was a 'sad bit of sexism from Mark Lawrenson there really is this the best the BBC can do?' Reaction to the comment was furious, with many bemoaning the BBC's choice of pundits . There was a flurry of tweets criticising the commentator after the throwaway comment was made . The BBC confirmed it had received 172 complaints regarding the incident. A spokesperson also apologised on behalf of Lawrenson, saying: 'The remark was inappropriate and we apologise for any offence caused.' Broadcasting watchdog OfCom said it was also aware of the incident. IIt had received six complaints but had not yet decided whether it be formally investigating. However, . Lawrenson's BBC colleague Gary Lineker has also copped flak for cracking . an offensive Twitter joke during the Belgium versus USA match.

The joke did not go down well with everybody, with many branding it offensive and disgusting. The BBC's World Cup commentary team has come under heavy critcism this summer for a series of gaffes and the belief some of its members are not up to standard. Former Everton player Phil Neville bore the brunt of the criticism, with complaints about his lack of emotion and 'monotone' style during England's opening game with Italy. The BBC received more than 400 complaints about his performance. Another incident for which the BBC drew widespread flak was Jonathan Pierce's failure to understand the newly implemented goal-line technology during the France and Honduras game. Failing to understand the way goal-line technology was being used during the tournament, Pearce's commentary descended into chaos when he appeared confused by a computer animation that first showed 'no goal' when the football hit the post, before changing to 'goal' when it crossed the line.

I am very interested in your country.’ The former prime minister is considered a hero in Albania. He was involved in the 1999 Nato action in Kosovo, when Serb forces attacked ethnic Albanians. Many children were named ‘Tonibler’ in his honour. The country, ruled by hardline Communists until the 1990s, became a democracy in 1998. It is one of Europe’s poorest countries, with its GDP 119th in the world – below war-torn Congo. A party spokesman would not say how much Mr Blair would be paid, but called him ‘a very important partner’. In the past: Tony Blair is surrounded by Kosovo refugees as he arrives at the refugee camp in Elbasan, Albania, in May 1999. The former prime minister is considered a hero in the country . Mr Blair has also signed deals to advise governments in Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Brazil and Colombia with the Government Advisory Practice, set up after he left Downing Street in 2007. He was criticised after it emerged . earlier this year that he will advise president Nursultan Nazarbayev of . Kazakhstan, whose police force shot and killed 15 striking oil workers . in December 2011. 'I will be very happy to help you. I am very interested in your country' Tony Blair . The deal with Kazakhstan was said to be worth £16million. The Government Advisory Practice is managed by another of Mr Blair’s companies, Windrush Ventures. Its accounts reveal profits of £3.6million in the year ending March 2012. A spokesman for Mr Blair said: ‘Mr Rama met Tony Blair in London last week. Mr Rama said that if he became prime minister, he would like Mr Blair’s advice on how to modernise. ‘Mr Blair said he would be happy to help. . . But no formal agreement was made.’","Albania hoping to join EU and is 'interested in New Labour-style reforms'

"Remember all those healthy New Year resolutions about going to the gym, walking to the shops and always taking the stairs at work? Well, if you still have pangs of guilt at how your best intentions failed to last the distance, here is some good news. The health effects of missing out on daily exercise and sitting around in the office all week can be cancelled out by just one workout a week. A new study has found those who managed two and a half hours of exercise on one or two days of the week were just as healthy as others doing the same amount stretched over a longer period . The one snag is that the weekly . exercise session – such as a brisk walk or bike ride – has to be an . exhausting two and a half hours long. Researchers found those who managed . 150 minutes of exercise on one or two days of the week were just as . healthy as others doing the same amount over a longer period. Dr Ian Janssen, who led the research, . said: ‘The findings indicate it does not matter how adults choose to . accumulate their 150 weekly minutes of physical activity.’ The Canadian study claims it does not matter how people accumulate their recommended weekly 150 minutes of exercise . Guidelines usually recommend adults . perform moderate to vigorous physical activity on most or all days of . the week for a total of 150 minutes, with no advice for frequency. So Dr Janssen and colleagues at . Queen’s University, Toronto, attached a motion detector to the waists of . 2,324 men and woman aged between 18 and 64. The tiny electrical actical . accelerometer, about the size of a small package of matches, records how . much a person moves every minute. The adults who met the advice of more . than 150 minutes a week of aerobic activity were divided into those who . exercised on five to seven or one to four of the days. Physical exams and blood tests on the . participants then measured their ‘metabolic syndrome’ which indicates . risk factors for diabetes, heart disease and stroke. Those who were ‘infrequently active’ were in no greater danger of developing these illesses than their . ‘frequently active’ counterparts, according to the study published in . the journal Applied Physiology, Nutrition and Metabolism. Dr Janssen said: ‘For instance, . someone who did not perform any physical activity on Monday to Friday . but was active for 150 minutes over the weekend would obtain the same . health benefits from their activity as someone who accumulated 150 . minutes of activity over the week by doing 20-25 minutes of activity on a . daily basis. ‘The important message is adults should aim to accumulate at least 150 minutes of weekly physical activity.’","Study found that those who did recommended 150 minutes of weekly exercise in one session were no less healthy than those who split it up .

"A Greek female pop star has courted controversy by appearing on a popular TV show as Stevie Wonder - blacked up and pretending to be blind. The bizarre performance came on Your Face Sounds Familiar, a talent show which is similar to the British programme Stars In Their Eyes. Singer Mando performed a rendition of Part-Time Lover, and dressed up as the blind African-American star to do so. Scroll down for video . Outrage: Singer Mando blacked up and pretended to be blind while performing as Stevie Wonder on Greek talent show Your Face Sounds Familiar . Contrast: The contestant is a 47-year-old singer who has had five gold records in her career . Your Face Sounds Familiar is an international franchise which originated in Spain and is currently showing in Britain on ITV. The Greek version was broadcast on channel ANT1 earlier this year, with all the contestants being national celebrities. Each week, every celebrity was assigned a star to impersonate, with the audience and judges voting on a winner. One week Mando, a 47-year-old singer who has had five gold records, was assigned Wonder's Part-Time Lover. Pretense: She enlisted an assistant to help her down the stairs as she imitated Wonder's blindness . Rendition: Mando's performance of Part-Time Lover was voted the highlight of that week's programme . When she emerged from backstage, she had blacked up her face and hands and was wearing a false moustache. She was obviously pretending to be blind, as a production assistant rushed out and helped her down the stairs, then led her to her piano. Although the audience continued to cheer and applaud during Mando's entrance, the judges looked taken aback by her surreal get-up. She proceeded to perform an accomplished take on the Motown singer's 1985 hit. Hit: The performance came on a popular TV show which has versions all around the world . Viewers apparently did not object to Mando's offensive outfit, as she was voted the winner of that week's contest. But web users have since spoken out against the bizarre episode, taking to Twitter to voice their shock. Jamie Cutteridge said the performance was 'the least acceptable thing ever, while George Anderson added: 'I'm picking my jaw off the floor.'","Mando, 47, dressed up as Motown singer on Your Face Sounds Familiar .

"Police are hunting a violent parolee who is suspected of pushing to his death in front of New York subway train as his horrified wife looked on. Wai Kuen Kwok, 61, was with his wife on Sunday when he was shoved by a man believed to be homeless man Kevin Darden. Darden, 35, has more than 30 arrests, including for trying to set his brother's house on fire and has also served time in prison. Scroll down for video . CCTV footage: Wai Kuen Kwok, 61, (right) was with his wife on Sunday when he was pushed by a man believed to be homeless Kevin Darden (left) Covered-up: He was seen wearing a black balaclava (top right) as he left 167th Street station in Highbridge . He was most recently arrested November 9 in Midtown for pick-pocketing, reports The New York Post. The couple were waiting for the D train, at the 167th street stop and were headed to Chinatown, in lower Manhattan. The suspect allegedly pushed the man from the platform just as a train arrived in the station, shortly before 9:00 am, as his horrified wife watched helplessly. The victim and his attacker did not appear to know each other and had not argued, witnesses said. Police released a video of the suspected killer, who left the scene by bus. On the video, a man wearing a black jacket over a dark t-shirt gets off the bus, goes into a store, and emerges to smoke a cigarette as he ambles away. A reward of $2,000 was offered for any information that could help the investigation. Train driver James Muriel told The New York Post that he is grieving for Kwok's widow. 'I would like to apologize to the family,' Muriel said. 'There was nothing I could have done. 'I see a body flying across the tracks. I placed the train in emergency. The train doesn't stop right away,' he went on. Danger:  Kwok was pushed off the platform at the Grand Concourse and East 167th Street station in Highbridge . Mystery: There was no indication that Kwok knew the man or had an altercation with him before he was pushed, police said . 'All of my passengers were crying with me. They were consoling me. They told me it wasn't my fault.' Every year, dozens of people are killed by the subway in New York though accident or suicide. However, this is first known incident of a person being pushed to his or her death on the tracks since December 2012, when two were killed in separate attacks. On December 28, a woman pushed an Indian immigrant to his death in Queens. Weeks earlier on December 3, a man was pushed from a stop in Manhattan during a fight with a deranged man. A New York Post front page picture of the man on the tracks a split-second before he was killed by the oncoming train provoked public fury as to why no one helped him -- and why the tabloid newspaper published the photo.","Wai Kuen Kwok, 61, was with his wife on Sunday when he was pushed by a man believed to be homeless man Kevin Darden .

"Two bombshell lawsuits filed against the Jehovah's Witnesses allege 'an insidious...epidemic' of child sex abuse within the church with roots at least as far back as the 1980s. Two sisters in Vermont and a group of three siblings in Connecticut are suing the secretive church, local branches and the 'ministerial servants' they say molested them in the 80s and 90s with no repercussions from church elders, despite both groups having reported the abuse. The suits are among several that co-attorney Irwin Zalkin says his firm has filed in Connecticut, Vermont and three other states. Revelations? Along with her sister Sybelle Almodovar (right), Evelyn Selimaj (left) is suing the Jehovah's Witness church over claims she and her sister were sexually assaulted in the 1980s and 1990s by a church 'ministerial servant' Their brother Ferdinand Almodovar (right in an undated family photo) is also suing. The siblings all say the church knew what had happened and did nothing. Theirs is one of several related lawsuits attorney Irwin Zalkin says have been or will be filed soon which name the church . 'This is an insidious problem, an epidemic problem with child sex abuse within this organization that so far seems more concerned about protecting its reputation from scandal than about the children,' Zalkin told the Hartford Courant. Along with Thomas McNamara, Zalkin is suing the East Spanish Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses New Haven and the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York on behalf of Sybelle Almodovar, Evelyn Selimaj and Ferdinand Almodovar. The siblings claim that over the course of five years, beginning in 1988, church ministerial servant Orlando Afanador sexually abused them while they were children living in New haven, Connecticut. Named: Evelyn Selimaj and her siblings have accused Orlando Afanador (picturede) of molesting them repeatedly over the course of five years. He's since been convicted on an unrelated sex abuse charge in Nebraska and remains a registered sex offender . Afanador--who is a registered sex offender for a Nebraska offense, for which he served several years in prison--moved into the attic of the children's home with his wife and would babysit them while their mother worked nights. According to the suit, he began coming into 8-year-old Sybelle's room and sexually assaulting her at night while 6-year-old Evelyn lay in fear nearby. Mr. Almodovar's suit claims Afanador forced him into performing oral sex some 25 times. Evelyn Selimaj said at a press conference Wednesday that, subsequent to the abuse, the family moved to the Dominican Republic and once there told elders at their new congregation about they'd endured. She said the church did nothing. 'We are not the first and we are not the last ones that he abused,' Selimaj said. 'While we cannot get our childhood back one thing we hope this lawsuit will do is prevent another child from the devastation we faced.' According to the Hartford Courant, co-attorney Thomas McNamara is also filing a suit on behalf of Bianca Martinez. Martinez lived in the same building as the Afanador and claims he molested her multiple times in New Haven. Not far away, in Vermont, Zalkin is representing another set of siblings who say they were also sexually assaulted by church 'ministerial servants' as children. Miranda Lewis, 23, and Annessa Lewis, 27, say in their lawsuits that they were abused in the 1990s at ages 4 and 5 by  Norton True, who they said the church knew had a history of sexually assaulting minors. 'This is an insidious problem, an epidemic problem with child sex abuse within this organization that so far seems more concerned about protecting its reputation from scandal than about the children,' co-attorney for the Connecticut siblings--as well as their counterparts suing in Vermont--Irwin Zalkin said. The Jehovah's Witness Brooklyn headquarters are shown here . There is one God Almighty--a Spirit Being with a body but not a human body. There is one God and no Trinity. God created the heavens and earth in six days, but each ‘day’ is equal to thousands of years. God created and controls all processes and events. Christ is Lord and Savior, but not God (Jehovah) incarnate, not a God-man but inferior to God. No soul remains after death. The original sin caused humans to inherit death and sin. Abortion is wrong. Homosexuality is a serious sin. Gender roles are defined: Men are the head of the household and women are loving caretakers. Service in the armed forces or any form of allegiance to government is prohibited. Blood transfusions are considered wrong, as God said the soul is in the blood. Bone marrow transplants are left to the individual conscience. source: beliefnet.com . They have sued True, the Bellows Falls congregation of the Jehovah's Witnesses and its governing body, Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York. They say their mother reported the allegations to the congregation but no action was taken against True. The congregation and the Watchtower Bible and Track Society of New York did not return messages seeking comment. True could not be reached; there is no phone listing for him in Vermont. Miranda Lewis on Tuesday attended a press conference with lawyer Jerome O'Neill, who has won millions of dollars in settlements for plaintiffs in priest sex abuse cases against the Vermont's Roman Catholic Diocese of Burlington. Speaking out: Miranda Lewis, 23, said Tuesday she and her sister were molested multiple times by 'ministerial servant' Norton True in the 1990s and that the church was told and did nothing. She is suing for an undisclosed sum . Pictured as a child: Miranda Lewis said she was molested multiple times by True, the first time at age 4 after a church meeting, when he stopped her from exiting the room . Lewis said she was molested multiple times by True, the first time at age 4 after a church meeting, when he stopped her from exiting the room. Annessa Lewis said she was molested by True at age 4 while he was babysitting her at his home. Their mother reported the allegations to the elders of the congregation, but they took no apparent action against True and did not report the allegations to police or a child protective agency, the lawsuit said. 'Defendants Bellows Falls Congregation and Watchtower, by their actions and choices not to take action, ratified, authorized and approved of Defendant True's sexual molestation of children,' the complaint said. The lawsuits seek unspecified damages. A Northern California jury awarded $28 million in damages to a woman who said the Jehovah’s Witnesses allowed an adult member of a Fremont, California, church to molest her when she was a child. In the summer of 2012, Alameda County jurors awarded $7 million in compensatory damages on Wednesday and an additional $21 million in punitive damages on Thursday to the plaintiff, Candace Conti. 'This is the largest jury verdict for a single victim in a religious child abuse case in the country,' Mr. Simons said. Historic award: In the summer of 2012, Alameda County jurors awarded $7 million in compensatory damages on Wednesday and an additional $21 million in punitive damages on Thursday to the plaintiff, Candace Conti (pictured) In her lawsuit, Ms. Conti, 26, said that in 1995 and 1996, when she was 9 and 10 years old and a member of the North Fremont Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses, she was repeatedly molested by a fellow congregant, Jonathan Kendrick. Ms. Conti has identified herself publicly to encourage other victims of sexual abuse to come forward, Mr. Simons said. The man Conti named: Mr. Jonathan Kendrick was never criminally charged in the case involving Ms. Conti, but he was also convicted in 2004 of lewd or lascivious acts with a child, records show . “Nothing can bring back my childhood,” Ms. Conti told The Oakland Tribune. “But through this and through, hopefully, a change in their policy, we can make something good come out of it.” Ms. Conti also said in her lawsuit that the Christian denomination’s national leaders formed a policy in 1989 that instructed the church’s elders to keep child sex abuse accusations secret. Congregation elders followed that policy when Mr. Kendrick was convicted in 1994 of misdemeanor child molestation in Alameda County, according to Mr. Simons. Mr. Kendrick was never criminally charged in the case involving Ms. Conti, but he was also convicted in 2004 of lewd or lascivious acts with a child, records show. Mr. Kendrick, 58, now lives in Oakley, Calif., according to the state’s sex offender registry. He was ordered to pay 60 percent of the judgment, but Mr. Simons said there would be no attempt to collect any money from Mr. Kendrick, in part because he would not be able to pay. The Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York — the organization overseeing the Jehovah’s Witnesses — would be responsible for 40 percent, Mr. Simons said. Jim McCabe, a lawyer for the congregation, said he planned to appeal the jury’s decision. “The Jehovah’s Witnesses hate child abuse and believe it’s a plague on humanity,” Mr. McCabe said. “Jonathan Kendrick was not a leader or a pastor. He was just a rank-and-file member. This is a tragic case where a member of a religious group has brought liability on the group for actions he alone may have taken.”","Separate suits filed this week in Vermont and Connecticut accuse two 'ministerial servants' of molesting several children in the 1980s and 1990s .

"A South African children's charity has been forced to apologise after running a controversial advertisement which showed a white woman feeding a black child like a dog.

Later, child is seen below the dining room table getting fed by the woman like a dog . Offence: The charity has been forced to apologise for the scenes which it claims were well-intentioned . The video was produced for South African charity Save A Child by advertising giant Ogilvy and Mather. Save A Child's chief executive Alza Rautenbach apologised for any offence caused by the advert. She said she wanted to raise the issue of child hunger in South Africa. She said: 'What if this advert changed a child's life? What if this advert changed 3.5 million children's lives? What if this was your child going to bed hungry tonight, and this advert can change that? 'The child was a character that the agency used. It wasn't chosen for any specific reason – and yes, the idea was to use multiracial people, just as our country is. It doesn't help to have an advert that is not representative.'

The charity apologised for the advertisement claiming their core message had been 'diluted or lost altogether' According to a statement: 'The management and associates of Feed A Child extends our unreserved apology to any person or group who have been offended or hurt in any manner by our recent commercial that was shown on national television and YouTube. Our intention was not to cause offence. 'We acknowledge the fact that the advert could have been seen as insensitive or distasteful and we take heed to the fact that many perceived the advert as racist. This was most certainly not the intention, and again we apologise. 'Unfortunately the core message of the commercial became diluted or even lost through the interpretation thereof. 'The core message of the commercial was to draw attention to the extremely important issue of malnutition and raise awareness of the plight of many children in South Africa who go to bed hungry. 'The commercial requests assistance to help us as an organisation (and many other organisations who do similar work) to address the situation. 'The decision has been made to withdraw the advert from all media.

"These stunning images reveal the Milky Way shining a light on the beauty of the UK's South West coast, with Durdle Door appearing to offer a gateway to the galaxy, . The images were captured by Liverpool-born photographer Stephen Banks, who has spent the last two years learning how to capture the night sky. The shots were all taken in rural Dorset, one of the last remaining areas of the UK to have avoided excessive light pollution from roads and cities. These sensational celestial snaps show the Milky Way in all its glory over a series of stunning countryside landscapes. They were taken by amateur photographer Stephen Banks, 25, who has spent the last two years learning how to capture the night sky. This stunning picture of West Bay captures the headlights from a truck parked at the cliff top which look more like beams from an alien spacecraft . Mr Bank’s most recent photos, taken over the past month, include some of the county's most iconic locations such as the renowned beauty spots Durdle Door and Lulworth Cove. One stunning picture of Durdle Door captures the headlights from a truck parked at the cliff top which look more like beams from an alien spacecraft. In another, lights from houses in the neighbouring villages of Chideock and Seatown appear to look like fire while high above the Milky Way looks like smoke. 'I pride myself on taking different photos so I like to take pictures of the Milky Way above recognisable landmarks,' said Mr Banks. 'That's why so many of my pictures involve Durdle Door (pictured), because so many people have been there' Lights from houses in the neighbouring villages of Chideock and Seatown appear to look like fire while high above the Milky Way looks like smoke. In order to capture the stunning scenes, self-taught Mr Banks programmes the shutter on his digital SLR camera to stay open for 30 seconds at a time to allow as much light in as possible . Boats in the distance casts a glow on the horizon, revealing the beauty of the Milky Way. Our galaxy is thought to be 120,000 light years across and contains more than 200 billion stars. On a clear night, when you look up into the night sky the most you can see from any one point on the Earth is about 2,500 stars . The Milky Way is thought to be 120,000 light years across and contains more than 200 billion stars. This makes it a ‘middleweight’ galaxy with the largest galaxy known, IC 1101, containing more than 100 trillion stars. On a clear night, when you look up into the night sky the most you can see from any one point on the Earth is about 2,500 stars. Like more than two-thirds of the known galaxies, the Milky Way has a spiral shape. At the centre of the spiral, a lot of energy and, occasionally, vivid flares are created. Based on the immense gravity that would be required explain the movement of stars and the energy expelled, astronomers believe the centre of the Milky Way has a supermassive black hole. Astronomers believe the Milky Way wasn’t always a stunning barred spiral. It formed into its current size and shape by ‘eating’ other galaxies. In order to capture the stunning scenes self-taught Mr Banks programmes the shutter on his digital SLR camera to stay open for 30 seconds at a time to allow as much light in as possible. The technique allows the camera to see the Milky Way and surrounding stars that would otherwise be invisible to the naked eye. Mr Banks, 25, whose day job is as a digital executive for Bridport-based Watershed PR, said: ‘I started taking long exposures of the night sky about two years ago. ‘In order to get these photos you need the most clear night possible. Observing the Milky Way is best done at the height of summer when the outer spirals are most visible. ‘The best places to take photos from are those with the least amount of light pollution. There are no cities or motorways in Dorset so there are plenty of places where it is very dark. ‘I check out each location in daylight to make sure I know where I'm going then return at night with a torch, my camera and a tripod. ‘It is hard to see anything with the naked eye so often it is a case of trial and error to establish the best shot.’ Mr Banks explained the camera shutter stays open for 30 seconds to let as much light in as possible. Within five or 10 shots he claim to usually have a good shot. ‘I pride myself on taking different photos so I like to take pictures of the Milky Way above recognisable landmarks,’ he said. ‘That's why so many of my pictures involve Durdle Door, because so many people have been there. ‘I love to show people familiar landscapes that people will not have seen with stars in before.’ While there are dark skies reserves in other parts of the South West, Mr Banks says he would like to see similar schemed in Dorset to help others make the most of the stunning views on offer.

"They may be small and dainty, but when it comes to their food, they certainly put up a good fight.

This fiercely fought battle between two young starlings has been documented by a bird lover in a series of stunning images . With feathers flying, the two birds locked beaks as they started to fight it out over scraps of food on a bird feeder, in Merseyside, Liverpool . When twitcher and nature photographer Steve Ward put food out for his feathered friends he said he had no idea that it would encourage bird brawls . When twitcher and nature photographer Steve Ward put food out for his feathered friends he had no idea that it would encourage bird brawls. But he was on hand with his camera to capture the starlings as they battled for their share. Mr Ward said he achieved the beautiful pictures of the notoriously vicious birds with a Canon EOS-1D X, with a 1/5000 second exposure. Mr Ward, from Crosby, said: 'The fighting included pecking, claws to the eyes, whistles, rattles, and clicks and mid-air attacks where they would lock claws together waiting for the weaker bird to let go first. Luckily the father of three was on hand with his camera to capture the starlings as they battled for their share . Mr Wars said he set up the feeding station so his children, Ciara, 11, Evie, seven and Max, three, could learn and share his love of birds, with no idea it would cause such an argument between the young birds . With neither bird backing down as they hover over the feeding tray it looks like this fight is far from over . The birds are notoriously vicious over their food. During angry attacks over feed they use their claws against their opponent and peck each other with their sharp beaks . 'Other starlings soon joined in and the scene almost looked like a group of drunk men fighting after last orders outside a pub. It got really ugly.' Mr Wars said he set up the feeding station so his children, Ciara, 11, Evie, seven and Max, three, could learn and share his love of birds. He said they were certainly getting an education from it. He said: 'I set up some feeders to attract local birds to my garden so the kids could enjoy watching and identifying them as they came in and fed. 'After putting out a block of suet insect feed, meal worms and some water the war soon unfolded. Mr Ward said the two birds appeared t be going 'hell for leather' as they battled it out for the feed . 'Two of the juvenile Starling siblings were going hell for leather to be the dominant bird and get the spoils. 'After doing some research on the birds I found out that Starlings can be extremely aggressive particularly over food. 'They are not always a well liked bird and during breeding season will even fight to the death. 'My children found them quite amusing as they would stand face to face in a territorial stand-off and then take to the air to finish off the battle. 'I only hope they learn that it is no way to behave.' Starlings, a UK ‘red-listed’ species - meaning it is of the highest conservation concern - hit an all-time low in the RSPB’s annual Big Garden Birdwatch survey last year and their numbers sank by a further 16 per cent in gardens this year. The European starling was introduced to the state in the late 1800s by a William Shakespeare fan, together with all the species figuring in his work.","The birds locked beaks over scraps on a bird feeder, in Merseyside .

"Injured: Cathie Kelly fell during thedive-bombing. Now she's taking legal action the owner of the office building she works at . A 59-year-old woman is suing her company's landlord after she was badly injured in a vicious attack - by a seagull. Cathie Kelly lost her footing and fell heavily after losing her shoe in the feathered assailant's attack. The project officer, who works in Greenock, Renfrewshire, Scotland was left upset and injured by the bird’s dive-bombing. Mrs Kelly is now suing the owner of the office building, claiming it did not take sufficient care for her safety. The Court of Session in Edinburgh heard how a nearby rubbish dump was a magnet for gulls which nested on the roof of the former school and became aggressive when they had chicks. Judge Paul Arthurson, QC, heard of dashes in and out of the building using umbrellas and how garages in the vicinity fly helium balloons to protect their cars from droppings. Previously there had been patrols using owls and hawks to try to get rid of the menace – but Mrs Kelly, from Glasgow, claimed these had stopped. She told how she stopped for lunch on June 17, 2010 and planned to head for a nearby burger van. She said it was impossible to see through the stained glass of the door as she went outside. ‘I walked out the door and I barely got to the bottom of the steps and this gull came for me at full speed, wings outstretched, coming right for my face. ‘I realised I would never get to the van so I had to get back into the building for safety.’ Mrs Kelly continued: ‘It was screaming at me. I was terrified. I thought it was going for my face. ‘I couldn’t look up to see it because it was right over my head and I really thought it was going to hurt me. I was shouting but it would not go away.’ Winged menace: Gulls are said to be a problem in the area where the attack occurred. File picture . The court heard how crouching Mrs Kelly turned as she tried to regain the safety of the building – but her left shoe came off and she stumbled onto the steps. ‘I was badly winded and I was in instant pain. It was very painful.’ Later that afternoon someone noticed her crying and gave her  a painkiller – but she was still  suffering and had to go home early. Her daughter took her to hospital that evening. Court papers describe how the incident left Mrs Kelly ‘shaken and distressed’. She was away from her work with CVS Inverclyde for two weeks then took to carrying an umbrella to protect her as she made her way to and from her office. Pains in her chest and thigh made sitting at a computer difficult and her husband and daughter had to step in to help with shopping,  cooking and other household tasks. For weeks she could only sleep upright and with the help of painkillers. Nesting gulls tend to be aggressive in response to predators and intruders and present 'a serious risk of injury to people moving within their vicinity' Mrs Kelly said that towers beside the door were a favourite nesting site for gulls. Discussing the incident with colleagues, she learned that a chick had fallen from the nest on the day she was attacked. Paperwork she has submitted to the court asserts ‘urban colonies of nesting gulls were a well-recognised phenomenon in the vicinity’. Nesting gulls tend to be aggressive in response to predators and intruders and present ‘a serious risk of injury to people moving within their vicinity’, claim Mrs  Kelly’s legal team. Ann Walsh, a manager with Enterprise Childcare, who also works in the Ladyburn business centre, said the gull problem had been going on for years. ‘I was attacked myself by gulls,’ she said. ‘I was pooed on as part of the attack.’ Mrs Walsh, 45, continued: ‘I had to bring a brolly to work and when they were particularly bad I had the brolly up.’ She said she was angry and had raised her concern with the building’s management. ‘You shouldn’t have to be dodging seagulls when you come to work in the morning,’ she said.Landlord Riverside Inverclyde (Property Holdings) denies liability. It says Mrs Kelly was partly to blame because she did not look where she was putting her feet. If she proves the building owner was entirely at fault, she stands to receive £7,000 in damages. The hearing continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Cathie Kelly fell after bird struck as she went to lunch .

"Disgraced former NRL player Todd Carney says he is ready to deal with his drinking problems, but still feels resentful after his dismissal from the Cronulla Sharks. The controversial footballer made a shameful exit from NRL in June, when the famous 'bubbler' scandal was the last nail in the coffin for the 28-year-old's career in Australia. Carney says he is bitter about his dismissal and is adamant he will never return to NRL, declaring his new French club, Catalans Dragons, will be his last. 'I've signed a three-year deal and I'd like to finish my career here and go on longer, after the three years,' Carney said during his first conference with French media. 'I'm really going to get into that and the culture and make this my home for the rest of my career.' Controversial Australian stand-off Todd Carney arrives in Perpignan . Todd Carney appeared in a candid interview where he revealed he was going to address his drinking issues through a program for troubled athletes in France . Scandalous football player Todd Carney has moved to France to play for the Catalans Dragons (left) after he was sacked from the Cronulla Sharks in June (right) Carney was dismissed after a photo was leaked showing him urinating in his own mouth, known as 'bubbling' He places the blame with Cronulla Sharks chief executive Steve Noyce for handing down a punishment the Carney believes he does not deserve. 'I'm not cranky at the club but me and Steve Noyce didn't get along and I felt he was the final wound in the back for me,' Carney told Nine News. Carney is adamant he would not have been dismissed if suspended Sharks coach Shane Flanagan had been at the club when the incident made headlines. Flanagan was suspended for 12 months in December 2013 over his involvement in the Cronulla Sharks supplement scandal. Carney made his first appearance with the club in front of French media on Monday . Carney is excited for a new beginning and has vowed to tackle his demons, after eight years of alcohol-related incidents which has had a devastating impact on his professional life . Since 2006, the playmaker has constantly made headlines for his off-field incidents, which saw him sacked from the Canberra Raiders, Sydney Roosters and Cronulla Sharks. He insists he takes ownership for his poor judgement in the past, but believes his exile from NRL was unwarranted. 'I've always put my hand up,' he told reporters in France on Monday. 'I've obviously done the wrong thing. 'I may not have deserved the punishment I got, but to be here in France ... I'm not looking back.' The 2010 Dally M award winner is ready for a new start in France with the Dragons, but knows the opportunity will be pointless unless he tackles his demons. 'I'm going to work out what's best for me with counselling and just working out why these issues arise,' Carney told Nine News. Now that he has joined the Catalans Dragons, Carney will receive counselling from 'Sporting Chance', a clinic from former England and Arsenal captain Tony Adams, who overcame his own battle with alcoholism. He will receive counselling from 'Sporting Chance', a clinic from former England and Arsenal captain Tony Adams, who overcame his own battle with alcoholism. Alcohol was often a contributing factor to Carney's crimes, which included drink-driving and reckless driving offences, allegations of assault and indecent behaviour, as well as damage to public property. Carney admits that he still goes out to nightclubs and drinks with his mates, despite the extensive damage alcohol-related incidents have had on his professional and personal life. I'm not going to come out and say that I haven't drank cos that'd be a lie.' He feels that being away from Australia will force him to be independent and learn self-respect. 'Being comfortable in my own self is the key,' Carney told Nine. Carney is certain suspended coach Shane Flanagan would have ensured the player remained with the club after the bubbler scandal, if Flanagan had still been in position . 'In France there are going to be days where I'm not going to find no one and I'm going to have to find myself and that's who you need in the end.' The free-spirited playmaker, who built up a lengthy rap sheet during a chequered NRL career, said he planned to fully immerse himself in the French culture - and even vowed to learn the language. That was an approach taken by Roosters coach Trent Robinson, who was in charge of the Dragons in 2011 and 2012 and played a significant role in convincing Carney that it would be the right place for him to rebuild his career. 'As soon as I get settled, I'll be taking (French) lessons,' said Carney, who will live with former Cronulla teammate Ben Pomeroy while he finds his own place. Carney says he will be taking French lessons and completely immerse himself in the culture .","Todd Carney will receive counselling from 'Sporting Chance' for his issues with alcohol in France .

"Anger: Israel's newly-elected chief rabbi David Lau has provoked fury after he was accused of making racist remarks about professional basketball players . Israel's newly elected chief rabbi has provoked fury after he was accused of making racist remarks about professional basketball players. David Lau, who is one of two men who serve as spiritual authorities for Israelis - made the apparent racist remark while addressing a group of ultra-orthodox yeshiva students. During a speech, Lau made reference to young people watching basketball on television in public rather than spending time studying the Torah. As reported by the Huffington Post, he said: 'Why do you care whether these [k]ushim  who are paid in Tel Aviv beat the kushim who are paid in Greece?"" The word kushim is a derogatory Hebrew term for black people. The comment angered members of the Israeli parliament with some calling for Lau to apologise. Speaking to the Jerusalem Post, Labor party representative Nachman Shai said the comment stands in contrast to the remarks made earlier this week by Pope Francis in reference to not judging gay people. But despite angering many, some also leapt to Lau's defence. Naftali Bennett, a minister of religious services and economics, told the newspaper that public figures should not be stalked by the media. It is believed that Lau's argument in speaking to the youngsters was supposed to highlight that by watching basketball on television in public could undermine the case for youths not being drafted into the Israeli Defense Forces. Fury: Lau's comments angered members of the Israeli parliament with some calling for him to apologise. He is pictured centre . Lau was elected last month to a 10-year term as Israel’s Ashkenazi chief rabbi. He canceled a planned vacation abroad after the reports about his comment.

Lets hope they let me go haha,' he tweeted. Scroll down for video . Vertiginous: The look down from what James Kingston says is Dubai's second-tallest building. He was arrested by Dubai police just after he descended from the 101-storey Princess Tower in the Marina district . Despite Twitter contacts raising fears that he could be in for some Emirati-style fierce punishment, Mr Kingston's detention did not last long. A short while after spreading news of his arrest he tweeted, 'I'm free!!' and posted a link to an Instagram photo taken high above Dubai's city streets. He added in a Facebook post: ' I was eventually released without charge & have loads of footage/photos of the climb. This [referring to the above picture] was the moment I arrived at the top floor of the building after a long climb. 1400ft (425m) above Dubai ... my highest climb yet. Mr Kingston's Instagram account shows he's spent the past five days on a climbing tour of Dubai, a wealthy metropolis with more completed or topped-out skyscrapers higher than 2/3 km, 1/3 km, or 1/4 km than any other city.

"An Alabama teenager criticized for taking a smiling selfie during a tour of the Auschwitz Concentration Camp has said she doesn't regret the picture. Breanna Mitchell defended her actions on TakePart Live on Monday, saying she took the picture in memory of her father, who taught her about the concentration camps. Criticism of the girl's selfie came during a growing trend of tourists snapping pictures of themselves at memorials, including at Ground Zero in New York. Scroll down for video . Defense: Breanna Mitchell says she took her Auschwitz selfie in memory of her father, who shared the teenager's love of history . In Mitchell's case, the teenager said she had made the trip to Auschwitz on the anniversary of her father's death, and had wanted a memento. 'Honestly, . I don't think I would do anything differently, because I didn't mean . any harm,' she said, according to Gawker. 'And, like, I told everybody my story behind it, so . that's the only reason I don't regret taking it.' The teenager added that she had been shocked by the sudden interest in the picture, and said she had been sent harsh messages and even death threats. Mitchell isn't the only social media fan to come in for criticism for what is deemed by many to be inappropriate photos. Some visitors to sacred sites including the memorial where the World Trade Centers used to stand in New York City have also used the trip as a chance for a selfie. And even President Obama was censured after posing for a picture with British Prime Minister David Cameron, and Denmark's prime minister Helle Thorning Schmidt during a memorial to Nelson Mandela. Pictures of tourists posing and poking their tongues out during visits to Auschwitz are seen as inappropriate by many . A growing trend in selfies at memorials or sites such as Auschwitz has appeared in recent years . Many have questioned whether sharing smiling pictures at places such as Auschwitz online is appropriate . Among the tourists who have been criticized is an 18-year-old from Florida, who has since defended his 9/11 memorial selfie. Chris Canning told ABC News he clearly remembered the attacks and wanted the photo to record his visit. 'I don't just want a photo of the . memorial, I want a picture of myself and the memorial. I wanted to capture a special moment,' he said. The New York memorial has explicit guidelines for its visitors, reminding them that: 'The Memorial and Memorial Museum are places of solemn reflection dedicated to honoring and remembering the tragic events and the overwhelming loss of innocent life that occurred at this location.' While it doesn't ban photography - and in some instances encourages visitors to record their trip with a #9/11memorial hashtag - the site's rules state: 'Proper decorum, personal behavior, and conduct is required from all visitors at all times in order to provide the entire visiting public with respect.' Photos of visitors pouting with the 9/11 memorial behind them have also been criticized . Sites such as the 9/11 memorial in New York attract huge crowds, but many have questioned whether it is right to take pictures there . Despite . the widespread criticism, some have argued that taking photos at the . memorial is a way for the public to engage in, and further understand . the tragedy. Photography . critic Susie Linfield said: 'What 9/11 did produce was a lot of citizen . documentation in the days following the attacks.' According . to The Awl, she added: 'These were not photographs of the attacks . themselves, but depictions of how we as New Yorkers tried not only to . survive, but also to help each other and to come together to understand . what was happening.'

'If you're going to stick your tongue . out or make a duck face in front of the World Trade Center, I think . that's probably inappropriate,' she told ABC News.

"Thousands of bat carcasses continue to litter the streets of a small town in New South Wales after an extreme heatwave caused the flying mammals to die in droves. Up to 5000 dead flying foxes are estimated to have died at Casino in northern New South Wales according to the Northern Star, as temperatures soared to 44 degrees over the weekend. However, amongst those saved by wildlife rescue organisation WIRES and other groups, were hundreds of baby bats most of which were less than one month old. Scroll down for video . Up to 5000 flying foxes are believed to have died over the weekend due to an extreme heat wave . A spokesperson for Wires explained that 'the extreme heat, low humidity and lack of shade' too early in the season, led to the mass deaths. By 1pm on Saturday, the first flying foxes began falling to the ground after dying in their trees. 'Female flying foxes have young this time of the year and hundreds of babies were clinging to their dead mothers on the ground,' a WIRES spokesperson said. 'Each of these orphans had to be assessed, hydrated and taken care of individually.' The streets of Casino, in northern New South Wales, are still being cleared of the carcasses after temperatures soared to 44 degrees on Saturday . 'The task is ongoing; carers are working round the clock and emotions are tested as carers do what they can to ensure each and every little flying fox is taken care of whilst dealing with the sight of thousands of adults and juveniles dead and dying.' Approximately 450 flying fox pups were rescued by volunteers, according to the Northern Star. The Rural Fire service sprayed trees with water over the weekend in an effort to help cool any surviving bats; however temperatures have since cooled in the small town. Carcases continue to be cleared from the neighbourhood by the local council who have also issued health warnings. About 450 baby bats less than one month old, which were found clinging to their dead mothers, have been saved by wildlife organisation WIRES . 'Some areas along the riverbank are inaccessible and the stench from the rotting carcasses will be quite unbearable for some time yet,' John Walker, the general manager of Richmond Valley Council, said. 'People should avoid the area and not try to help living bats themselves as they could bite and scratch and some carry the lyssavirus.' 'Young children could be attracted to the bats on the ground but there could be serious health risks if they pick them up,' Mr Walker said.","Casino, in northern New South Wales, reached 44 degrees on Saturday .

London-based YouGov collected data from 190,000 UK members over 120,000 data points including where people bank, what cars they drive and what they like to eat. The free web app lets people search for information about people who own different phones, eat different foods, shop in various supermarkets and live in certain areas, among other data. Click below to explore the profiler . London-based YouGov collected data from 190,000 UK members over 120,000 data points. The free web app (above) lets people search for information about people who own different phones, eat different foods, shop in various supermarkets and live in certain areas, among other data . The app does not show the typical fan or customer, because as YouGov explained: ‘If it did, most groups would look very similar, and you wouldn't learn a lot about the specifics of particular thing.’ Instead, it shows what is particularly true about a group. YouGov compares the group to their natural 'comparison set'. For example, it compares fans of Downton Abbey to anyone who has rated any TV shows, and detemines which of the thousands of datapoints most 'overscore' in the target group. If something is only true of 1 per cent of the overall population, but is true of 6 per cent of YouGov’s target group, it might score very highly, but this doesn't mean it is true of all of them.

The YouGov panel only includes adults of 18 years or older, and if the sample shows 52 people, YouGov explained that it doesn’t mean they only surveyed 52 people. Instead, it means that, of the tens of thousands of people who took part, 52 have identified themselves as fans or customers of that particular brand of item.

"Godfrey Bloom’s comments about what he sees as the abuses of British aid to ‘bongo bongo land’  have provoked a storm. But there is ample evidence to back up the Ukip MEP’s claims. Here, we examine some of the most flagrant abuses. RWANDA . As well as arming a violent revolt in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, President Paul Kagame is accused of enriching himself at his country’s expense. His luxuries include two private jets – South African-registered Bombardier BD-700 Global Expresses – costing £30million each. He owns an opulent palace in the Rwandan capital Kigali and his weekend retreat is a huge farm in the countryside. He has a weakness for Rolex watches, and in 2011 he stayed in a £12,000-a-night hotel room in New York – a sum that would take the average Rwandan worker 18 years to earn. Britain is Rwanda’s biggest foreign aid donor and last year was due to hand over £75million. Kagame has been pictured with David Cameron, who described the country last year as a ‘continuing success story’. In July last year Britain temporarily suspended £16million of the aid package following a critical report, but the then International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell, a personal friend of Kagame, reinstated the payments on his last day in the job. In November, Britain halted a further £21million in aid payments over human rights concerns. UGANDA . In 2009 dictator Yoweri Museveni allegedly used aid money to pay for a £30million private jet, a top-of-the-range Gulfstream G550. The then Labour government gave his poverty ravaged country £70million in 2008/09 through the Department for International Development and an additional £57million through the European Union. As millions of his people struggled to feed themselves, Museveni lavished the cash on the 562mph plane, described as the ‘world’s most versatile and stylish ultra-long-range jet’. Two years later it emerged he was buying six Russian fighter jets for nearly £500million – the same amount as Britain is scheduled to give in aid to Uganda by 2016. Museveni, who has led Uganda since 1986, has been severely criticised for his human rights record. GABON . Controversial: Godfrey Bloom's comments about what he sees as the abuses of British aid to 'bongo bongo land'  have provoked a storm . Ali Bongo, president of the impoverished state, spent £85million on a 48,000 sq ft mansion in the heart of Paris three years ago. The 14-bedroom property on the upmarket Rue de l’Universite includes a heated swimming pool, Jacuzzi, seven parking spaces and a tennis court. He is thought to own 39 properties in the French capital. Between 2005 and 2009 Britain spent £6.1million on aid to Gabon through international agencies such as the European Union, the World Bank and United Nations. CONGO . In 2011 it was revealed that Denis Sassou Nguesso, president of the French Congo, had built up a multi-million-pound Paris property portfolio with the help of British taxpayers’ aid money. A report by anti-corruption groups showed he owned 16 of the most luxurious residences there. His country is among the biggest recipients of UK foreign aid. In 2011 it received £133million and that sum is set to rise to £258million by 2015. EQUATORIAL GUINEA . Teodoro Obiang Mangue, the son of the president of Equatorial Guinea, lived a playboy lifestyle in a beach mansion in Malibu, California, and once spent a reported £1.8million on Michael Jackson memorabilia. He is accused of amassing £65million from the African country while serving as its forestry minister. He spent £21million on the Malibu mansion, bought a £26million Gulfstream jet and a fleet of 24 luxury cars. His father owns several properties in Paris including an entire six-storey period building on the prestigious Avenue Foch, worth £15million. In 2011 as part of a corruption investigation French authorities seized and later sold nine luxury cars from the Obiang family, including a Ferrari, an Aston Martin V8, two Bentleys and a Rolls-Royce Phantom Coupe. They raised £2.7million at auction. Also seized were one of Teodoro’s Paris homes, art works and 300 bottles of Chateau Petrus worth almost £2million. Britain has no direct aid programme with the country but funnels money through the EU, World Bank and UN – more than £3.5million between 2005 and 2009. SOUTH AFRICA . Last year it emerged that President Jacob Zuma had spent £17.5million to upgrade his rural home into a luxury mansion. The sum is almost exactly the amount Britain gave to South Africa the previous year. The Zuma estate includes 31 new houses, a bunker accessed by lifts, a helipad and state-of-the art security systems, including fingerprint-controlled access pads. In addition, roads to the property were given £40million of improvements. Splashing out: Last year it emerged that South African President Jacob Zuma, pictured, had spent £17.5million to upgrade his rural home into a luxury mansion . Zuma, who has four wives and at least 20 children, is said to have spent only £700,000 of his own money on the project. Britain is committed to spending an average of £19million a year in aid on South Africa until 2015. SIERRA LEONE . In one of the worst cases of the blatant theft of aid money, £1.2million given by Britain to ‘support peacekeeping’ was stolen. According to WikiLeaks files, in 2009 the country’s ‘top brass’ stole the money and spent it on plasma TVs and other consumer items. A secret cable from the US embassy reported ‘deep corruption’ within the defence ministry, ‘primarily through pocketing [by the top brass] of enlisted men’s salaries’.","Rwandan President accused of enriching himself at his country’s expense .

"Holster those guns and put down those pitchforks because a chemist has come up with a surprising way that you could help you survive a zombie apocalypse. Using a combination of three terrifyingly disgusting smells, an expert believes she can create ‘Eau De Death’ that mimics the smell of rotting human flesh. While many people may prefer to stick to floral perfume and musky cologne for the time being, the scientist thinks that it could be used to dupe zombies into believing a wearer is dead – should the highly improbably night of the living dead occur. Dead smelly: Using a combination of three terrifyingly disgusting smells, a chemist believes she can create 'death cologne' (imaginary advertisement pictured) that mimics the smell of rotting human flesh to fool zombies . It features just three chemical compounds. Putrescine and cadaverine are the main ingredients, which are emitted early on in the decaying process. Both organic chemical compound are produced by the breakdown of amino acids in living and dead organisms and are toxic in large doses. They are largely responsible for the foul odour of putrefying flesh, but also contribute to bad breath and can be found in semen. Methanethiol, which smells like rotten eggs is also added to the 'perfume' to create its offensive bouquet. Dr Raychelle Burks of Doane College in Nebraska says that the zombie-repellent or ‘death cologne’ can be made using just three chemicals – and that a little would go a very long way. She explains the vile concoction is primarily a mixture of two ‘perfectly named’ putrid chemical compounds called putrescine and cadaverine, which are emitted early on in the decaying process. ‘But maybe if you want to really round off the smell of death for the cologne, we should add in methanethiol. ‘It’s got that rotten egg, boiled cabbage smell,’ she said in a video for the American Chemical Society. Smells rotten: The vile 'death cologne'concoction is primarily a mixture of two putrid chemical compounds called putrescine and cadaverine, which are emitted early on in the human decaying process . The idea is that a spritz of the pungent perfume would make you smell like a corpse and not be of any interest to a hungry zombie trying to sniff out fresh meat to gnaw upon. ‘This cologne is an evasive method, which when coupled with zombie mannerisms - as seen in “The Walking Dead” or “Shaun of the Dead” - would be effective in avoiding a zombie attack when moving among a zombie horde. ‘One could also wear it when casually waiting out the zombie apocalypse so as not to attract the attention of a roaming horde of zombies,’ she told NBC News. Dr Burks has been working on death cologne for three years and said in the video: ‘If we’re really trying to mimic a corpse we have got to get the smell down to perfection. Fresh meat: The idea is that a spritz of the pungent perfume would make you smell like a corpse and not be of any interest to a hungry zombie (illustrated) trying to sniff out fresh meat to gnaw upon . ‘Nobody wants to be the guinea pig that spritzes on the death cologne and realises it doesn’t quite work.’ For people worried about how easy it would be to produce vast quantities of the stench in a bid to protect the population of Earth, Dr Burks said remarkably little would be needed as it is ‘incredibly stinky in very low quantities.’ She explained that modified E.coli bacteria could be used to make all the polyamines (an organic compound with two or more amino groups) needed to produce the scent.","Dr Raychelle Burks of Doane College in Nebraska says that the zombie-repellent can be made using just three chemical compounds .

"Fugitive spy Edward Snowden dramatically fled Hong Kong yesterday accompanied by an ex-girlfriend of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. The former CIA technician flew to Russia hours after the White House warned Hong Kong not to drag its feet over his extradition. Last night he slept in a hotel at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport. He is expected to fly to Cuba today for a connecting flight to South America. Scroll down for video . Searching for asylum: Edward Snowden is travelling to Ecuador after being charged with espionage in America. He met with Ecuador's ambassador as he landed in Moscow today . His final destination is now known to be Ecuador after its foreign minister Ricardo Patino Aroca confirmed Snowden had applied there for asylum. Assange, 41, has himself been holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for more than a year to avoid extradition to Sweden on sex charges. Snowden, 30, was accompanied on his flight to Moscow by British activist, Sarah Harrison, a WikiLeaks spokesman and former girlfriend of Assange. They travelled business class on Aeroflot flight SU213 and were met by officials from Ecuador including its ambassador to Moscow Patricio Chavez. He told reporters at the airport: . ‘We’re waiting for Sarah. We’re going to talk to them.’ Miss Harrison, . who has also worked for the discredited Bureau of Investigative . Journalism, was praised by WikiLeaks last night for ‘courageously’ assisting Snowden. Advice: Sarah Harrsion (left) travelled with Snowden (right) to Moscow. She is said to have helped him make a 'lawful departure' from Hong Kong . Asylum: The pair were met by two cars, pictured, from the Ecuadorian embassy parked at Moscow's Sheremetevo airport today . The City University graduate went to work for WikiLeaks several years ago and soon became known as the gatekeeper to Assange. It was once claimed she did everything for him, ranging from organising his diary to washing his socks. Right-hand woman: Sarah Harrison, pictured outside the embassy in London where her then-boyfriend Julian Assange is seeking asylum . Last . year Miss Harrison was forced to pay £3,500 to the courts after she had . put up £5,000 as one of the people who provided sureties for Mr . Assange’s bail conditions. A . WikiLeaks statement said yesterday: ‘Miss Harrison has courageously . assisted Mr Snowden with his lawful departure from Hong Kong and is . accompanying Mr Snowden on his passage to safety.’ Snowden . has been charged with espionage after exposing Prism – a covert project . run by US intelligence that snoops on Facebook accounts, emails and . phone calls. He has also . detailed a massive electronic eavesdropping operation by Britain’s GCHQ . called Operation Tempora. Snowden described it as ‘the largest programme . of suspicionless surveillance in human history’. The US had made a formal request to the Hong Kong government for a provisional arrest warrant to stop him leaving the territory. But relations cooled after Snowden claimed the US had hacked into Chinese mobile phone companies to access millions of text messages. Beijing said it was ‘gravely concerned’ about the allegations. In a statement yesterday, the Hong Kong government said Snowden boarded a plane at Chep Lap Kok airport ‘on his own accord for a third country through a lawful and normal channel’. It said documentation provided by America for the arrest warrant did not ‘fully comply’ with Hong Kong law. Clearly irritated, the Hong Kong government also demanded ‘clarification’ on hacking saying it would ‘follow up on the matter’ to protect the legal rights of its citizens. In the US, security chiefs were . bewildered at how Snowden had been allowed to leave the Chinese- run . territory because his passport had been revoked on Saturday.Keith . Alexander, head of the US National Security Agency said: ‘This is an . individual who is not acting, in my opinion, with noble intent. ‘What Snowden has revealed has caused irreversible and significant damage to our country and to our allies.’ Democratic senator Charles Schumer believes Russian President Vladimir Putin approved Snowden’s flight to Moscow. He said: ‘Putin always seems almost . eager to stick a finger in the eye of the United States – whether it is . Syria, Iran and now of course with Snowden.’ He also suggested China may have had a role to play in Snowden’s departure from Hong Kong.He added: ‘It remains to be seen how much influence Beijing had on Hong Kong. Spokeswoman: Miss Harrison became close to Assange when she started working at WikiLeaks and is believed to have acted as his assistant . Sympathetic: Ecuador Ambassador to Russia Patrizio Alberto Chavez Savala, pictured left with Vladimir Putin, was waiting for Snowden in Moscow . ‘As you know, they coordinate their foreign policies and I have a feeling that the hand of Beijing was involved here.’ Former Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon, legal director of WikiLeaks and lawyer for Julian Assange, said: ‘The WikiLeaks legal team and I are interested in preserving Mr Snowden’s rights and protecting him as a person. ‘What is being done to Mr Snowden and to Mr Julian Assange – for making or facilitating disclosures in the public interest – is an assault against the people.’ Safe haven: Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has taken refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London to avoid arrest and extradition to Sweden over rape allegations . It would be ironic if whistleblower Snowden makes Ecuador his home given their poor human rights record in the past. President Rafael Correa has been accused of repeatedly using his country’s defamation laws to restrict freedom of speech. Human Rights Watch also said Ecuador has used ‘terrorism and sabotage’ laws to prosecute cases involving protesters against mining and oil projects and insisted cases of police brutality go unpunished. Revelations by Snowden  published in The Guardian ‘probably breached’ the Official Secrets Act, security experts say. The paper did not seek the advice of the Defence Advisory Committee before publishing stories considered potentially dangerous to national security. A source close to the body, known as the D-Notice committee, said: ‘The stories were also probably a breach of the Official Secrets Act.’ The reports revealed how GCHQ spied on diplomats at the G20 conference in 2009 and also its massive tapping operation on fibre optic cables carrying data to Europe.","Edward Snowden, 30 flew to Moscow with British activist Sarah Harrison .

"She is just five-years-old but already has a following on Instagram to equal Cameron Diaz. And thanks to her million followers around the globe, internet sensation Breanna Youn has swapped a cramped flat with her parents and brother for a Hollywood star's jetset lifestyle. The little girl has been flown business class around the world and showered with presents worth hundreds of thousands of pounds, from Louis Vuitton handbags and Chanel and Tiffany jewellery to designer outfits, banquets and hampers laden with chocolates and cookies. Scroll down for video . Rolling in it: Breanna poses next to a Rolls Royce in Dubai where she now lives after she rocketed to fame . Gifts: Breanna shows off some of the upscale presents she has been showered with . Loving the LV: Thanks to her benefactors Breanna now lives a gilded lifestyle in Dubai - after moving from South Korea in May. They came for a visit but they decided to stay after her fame took off . Surprise! Rarely a day goes by when there is not another unexpected gift arriving on her doorstep . Rarely a day goes by when there is not another surprise gift arriving on her doorstep - all because her mother started posting cute pictures of her online. The Breanna effect snowballed when wealthy, high-profile Emiratis in the United Arab Emirates spotted the cute Korean girl's short videos on the picture sharing website Instagram. In them, she dances along to Korean pop music, sings along to Miley Cyrus and poses with designer handbags. When the Emiratis began reposting her videos six months ago, Breanna came to the attention of web surfers across the Middle East, where internet usage is as high as 77 per cent. Her mother Jocelyn, 27, responded by teaching her phrases in Arabic gleaned off YouTube and signing off each video with the Arabic word 'bosaah', meaning kisses, and the fans followed in their droves. Her wealthy fans in the Middle East even flew her from her home in South Korea to Dubai, where her family has been put up for free in five star hotels since May and chauffeur driven in limos. Breanna's 1.1m Instagram followers - who have been joined by an average 60,000 new followers per day - dwarf those of Pixie Rose Curtis, the redheaded Australian three-year-old who was dubbed the Princess of Instagram with 90,000 followers, a fraction of the number eager to find out what Breanna does next. Five-star: Breanna and her mother, father and Braxton her brother, plus a friend. Braxton, aged seven, said: 'I'm smart but Breanna is beautiful' Rich and famous: Breanna's father said she is now treated like a Hollywood actor and recognised everywhere . Cute: Her mother said: 'She has something inside her that makes people love her and makes them happy' Growing: An average 60,000 more people follow Breanna each day. She currently has 1.1m followers . She will equal Diaz within days, who has 1.16m followers, and she is quickly catching up with One Direction's Zayn Malik and Girls creator Lena Dunham, both of whom have 1.2m Instagram fans. But her popularity is a puzzle to her parents. Mrs Youn told MailOnline: 'I don't know why people love Breanna so much. She does not have any special talent that she is good at like dancing and she does not do much on camera. She only does a little drama and smiles and poses. 'But she has something inside her that makes people love her and makes them happy. She is just very sweet. 'Whenever I put her in front of a camera, she is a natural and loves posing.' Breanna, who has a Korean father, 34-year-old Junghyun, and a Filipina mother, speaks four languages, including English, Korean, Tagalog and Arabic. Her short videos on Instagram show her practising all four languages, dancing along to Shakira and Korean pop music. She also has the occasional meltdown when she wants ice cream or chocolate. Like America's Honey Boo Boo and much of today's younger generation, Breanna wears her heart on her sleeve and is completely comfortable living her life in public in front of a camera. She also has 305,000 followers on the short video website Vine and 210,000 fans on a Facebook fan page. On Vine, she has more than 55m loop counts - the measure Vine uses to record how many times people repeatedly play gifs, or image files. Her popularity started when Mrs Youn posted pictures of her daughter on her own Facebook page. Strangers begged her to set up a Breanna fan page so Mrs Youn obliged a year ago. The Vine site was set up shortly after but it was only when she set up OfficialBreannaYoun on Instagram seven months ago - mainly to stop fraudsters from pretending to be her - that Breanna's fame rocketed. She has attracted hundreds of thousands of fans from Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia. One mother posted a message saying her day was not complete until she had seen Breanna online . Besotted: Fans flock to see her updates. Breanna loves Hello Kitty, the colour pink and chocolate . Mystery: Breanna's fame snowballed after her mother posted a picture of Breanna on her Facebook page. Since then her parents have been bewildered by her soaring popularity . Taxi! Breanna holds her hand out to hail a cab looking as cute as a button in a typical image from her page . 'Most of them were posting comments in Arabic,' says Mrs Youn. 'There were thousands of them. It was difficult for me to understand so I had to get them translated one by one. 'I have no idea how they found her in the first place but they love her.' Her hundreds of thousands of followers are besotted, with some even telling Mrs Youn: 'I love her more than my own children'. One mother posted a message saying her day was not complete until she had seen Breanna online. Most of her followers in the region are in Saudi Arabia. Breanna has been invited to present on game shows and model everywhere from Bahrain to Indonesia. It was one such invitation that first brought the family to Dubai in May for a fortnight's holiday, which became a permanent stay. The Youns - who also have a seven-year-old son Braxton - were living in a modest two-bedroomed apartment in Busan, South Korea, and were running a seafood export business when the offer came to fly to Dubai in May. Since then, they have turned their backs on their Catholic and Mormon upbringings to convert to Islam. They are still living in Dubai, courtesy of their wealthy benefactors. Like Pixie's parents Roxy Jacenko and Oliver Curtis, the Youns have been criticised for over-exposing their daughter, who is too young to know any better. But Mrs Youn said: 'As parents, you are happy that people love your children. They fall in line for Breanna's picture at shopping malls. 'Now Breanna knows she is famous. If we go to the mall, she will ask why people are not taking pictures with her. She is used to it. 'In Korea, she got attention and people wanted pictures with her because she is cute. Here, they want to take them because they recognise her from Instagram. It makes us feel really special. 'These famous people love this ordinary little girl and now she is extraordinary.' Mr Youn denied the family was addicted to fame and said he worried about what would happen when Breanna grew up. He said: 'I hope people keep loving her. Sometimes I worry about what will happen in the future when they grow up. 'We cannot stop this now. If Breanna is sick and we do not post a picture or video for three or four days, we are bombarded with thousands of emails from every country asking what happened. Momentum: Breanna's father said he couldn't stop her fame now. He said: 'If Breanna is sick and we do not post a picture or video for three days, we are bombarded with thousands of emails asking what happened' Fame: Her mother told MailOnline: 'Breanna knows she is famous. If we go to the mall, she will ask why people are not taking pictures with her'. The family converted to Islam after moving to Dubai . 'We are treated like famous actors here. Even if we are in a restaurant and Breanna is hungry, people hug and kiss her and you cannot say no.' Breanna cried when the number of followers reached 600,000, saying: 'I am just so happy'. She added: 'I love being in Dubai, even though it is very hot.' Her brother added: 'I am smart but Breanna is beautiful'.","Breanna Youn is adored across the globe and in the Middle East in particular. She now has the same number of followers as Cameron Diaz .

"Sacked: Former Greenwich tourism chief Neil McCollum joked about crime in the borough . A tourism boss who slated an area he was paid £60,000 a year to promote has been sacked after a three month probe into his comments. Neil McCollum was head of tourism for the London borough of Greenwich and responsible for the area's Olympic welcome strategy when he branded a nearby district 'unsafe' in a Twitter rant earlier this year. His internet comments caused an outcry and despite having them removed from his account a blogger spread them sparking outrage. Mr McCollum tweeted: 'Guest appearance in Woolwich today.  Wonder if it has changed. 'Mental note: Make sure wallet is not visible!' The area is understood to have issues with low-level crime and has undergone several redevelopments. Residents in the South East London borough quickly complained about Mr McCollum's jibe and the message was removed from his Twitter account. After a three-month investigation, Greenwich Council chiefs have now dismissed Mr McCollum from his post. Incriminating: Mr McCollum's facetious Twitter message, which backfired . Mr McCollum, who lives in Whitstable, Kent, had also been in charge of Greenwich's Olympic welcome strategy. Greenwich is hosting equestrian and shooting events next year. Several residents backed the council's decision with messages posted on the internet. One wrote: 'Regardless of the truth that Woolwich has a crime problem, his job was to paint the whole borough in the best possible light and in that he failed.' But others criticised the council. One message said: 'He's an idiot for posting every thought that pops into his head on Twitter but what he said is correct.' Another added: 'This shows how we allow political correctness to take priority over honesty and common sense.' Greenwich council confirmed a tourism officer had been dismissed.

"Jason Young, 29, is carrying three-and-a-half stone of excess skin after losing 13 stone from weight loss surgery . A chef who lost 13 stone after gastric bypass surgery is furious that the NHS has denied him second operation to remove three and a half stone of excess skin. Jason Young, 29, from Nottingham, ballooned to 31 stone and underwent the £10,000 surgery eight years ago. His weight has since plummeted to 18 stone and he has been left carrying huge folds of saggy skin. But Mr Young claims the follow-up operation he was promised to remove the skin has been repeatedly turned down. He says the excess skin is now making his life so miserable he's even considered suicide. Mr Young - who says he gained weight because of an under active thyroid - said: 'I was delighted when I was accepted for the gastric bypass. 'After years of putting on weight as a teenager I thought my life would finally change for the better. 'They promised me a follow-up operation to remove the skin, but they keep fobbing me off and I'm getting desperate. 'The skin's so heavy on my front it makes my back hurt when I stand. I don't understand how I can be rejected for surgery which I clearly need.' A gastric bypass is a permanent operation where part of the digestive system is removed so the patient can only absorb around 50 per cent of the calories he consumed. Within a month of the operation at St James Hospital in Leeds, Mr Young had shed over three stone and in less than a year his weight plunged to 18 stone. The bachelor says his last relationship broke down because his girlfriend couldn't handle his stress and mood swings. He has recently moved in with his father . to be closer to the pub where he is now working but says his skin . condition is ruining his life. 'I've been waiting eight years and it's making my life a living hell - I've got excess skin everywhere and it's horrible,' he says. 'I've got no self-confidence and I'm too ashamed of my body to go swimming or wear tight clothes. Overweight: Jason says he started piling on the pounds as a teenager due to an underactive thyroid . 'I feel like I won't be able to have another relationship until I've had the surgery and it's removed.' Jason is now planning to appeal against the hospital's refusal to give him the skin removal operation. Excess skin is extremely common after weight loss surgery, explains Guido Kohler, a plastic surgeon . who works privately and at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS . Foundation Trust. ‘This excess skin after weight loss is the same skin damage that occurs during pregnancy — but all over the body,’ he says. Factors that affect how much skin is . left after a dramatic weight loss include age, how quickly the weight . was lost (gastric bands are slower than bypasses, for example), and, for . women, the number of children she has had. ‘After extreme weight loss, many . patients develop an “apron” of skin around the abdomen, and loose skin . under the arms, chest and inner thighs,’ explains Mr Kohler. ‘It can all . be very uncomfortable and upsetting.’ Jason claims he was promised a follow-up operation to remove the skin but repeated requests to have it done have been turned down . This excess skin can cause a range of medical problems, too. One of the most common is intertrigo — a bacterial, fungal, or viral infection that occurs often due to the difficulty in keeping these folds of excess skin clean and dry. Patients also find the folds of skin make it difficult to exercise. Excess skin is a problem particularly for people who undergo bariatric (weight loss) surgery. Mr Kohler says: ‘Sadly, there are some patients who do not seem to have been prepared for this situation beforehand, and post-weight loss can be a very disappointing and psychologically damaging time for them. Some do question why they had the surgery in the first place.’","Jason Young was given a gastric bypass after weight rocketed to 31 stone .

"It was 30,000 police against one man. And while the former lost the battle, the latter lived to fight another day. Supporters of controversial Godman Rampal faced the might of the security forces on Tuesday as a huge number of personnel, mostly from the Haryana Police, launched a massive assault on Satlok Ashram to arrest him. Residents of Barwala in Hisar district, where the ashram is located, woke up to one of the bloodiest days of their lives as pitched battles were fought between the Sant’s supporters and the police. More than 200, including security and media personnel, were injured in the violence. Chaotic scenes: Over 200 were injured in clashes between Rampal’s supporters and police. Here the guru's followers throw bricks and stones towards police outside the godman's ashram in Hisar, Haryana. This came after the Punjab and Haryana High Court on Tuesday reserved its judgement on cancellation of Rampal's bail in connection with a 2006 murder case. During the hearing, the amicus curiae pressed for immediate cancellation of his bail, saying the credibility of the entire judicial system would be at stake if his bail was not cancelled. The operation, which started around 11.45am and continued till late in the evening, failed as the self-styled Godman had put up a human shield of 70,000 followers, including women and children, around him, and managed to evade arrest. STILL HOLED UP . (Left and right): Police drag protesting Rampal followers from the site of the ashram, where women and children have formed a human shield around the compound . Nurses care for a disciple wounded in the violent clashes with police. The security forces have used lathi-charges and water cannon against protesters, who responded with bricks, fire-bombs, and what one officer called 'a huge cache of acid'. Sources said Rampal is still holed up inside his ashram, protected by a tight security cover of his followers. Ashram spokesman Raj Kapoor, meanwhile, has said that Rampal is “unwell” and is being treated at an “undisclosed location”. SP Hisar Satyendra Gupta gave an early indication to Rampal’s supporters who had gathered outside his ashram that the police were in no mood to negotiate with the Godman as his personnel tried to break the human shield. Tension mounted as supporters of Rampal refused to pay heed to repeated announcements by the police over loud speakers demanding entry to the premises so they could arrest him. Police then lobbed tear-gas shells and resorted to lathi-charge to disperse Rampal's supporters, who allegedly fired back and even threw fire bombs and acid. Medical staff (left) stitch a woman's head wound, and (right) tend the leg of an injured disciple. Wounded people from all factions were taken to Hisar civil hospital and Rohtak PGI. Volunteers help an injured supporter of Rampal as he arrives at hospital in Hisar . Security forces tried to storm the back of the ashram to prevent injury to the godman's 'human shield' of followers, many of whom are women and children. Some supporters who left the fortress-like ashram claimed that people are being held inside against their will. As the day progressed, security personnel made five attempts to enter the ashram, but failed at every turn. Injured policemen were taken to the regional health centre at Barwala. The seriously injured were taken to Hisar civil hospital and Rohtak PGI. Two policemen suffered bullet wounds. One woman sustained serious burn injuries, and it remains unclear how she sustained these, an official said. “They have assembled a huge cache of acid bottles which they are throwing at us from roof tops apart from stones and bottles of petrol,’ said Satpal Sangwan, an injured constable, while he was being taken for treatment. Another constable, Sunil Kumar, complained that  the operation remained unsuccessful as they were ordered not to open fire, . Media personnel also faced the brunt of the violence that left some of them injured, while the cameras of many electronic news channels were damaged. Police brutality has been reported against media covering the siege. At one point, security personnel attempted to break into the ashram from the other side so that women and children who had formed the human chain were not injured in the operation. Siege: The godman's followers have been standing guard for several days outside the ashram. Heavy earth-moving machinery has now been brought in to dismantle the building . Defiant: Armed with sticks, the godman's followers shout slogans towards police as the clashes continue . Earth mover machines were used to break down the wall of the ashram. However, at the end of a five-hour effort, the wall was brought down only partially. Some disciples who managed to come out from the ashram claimed that thousands of people were still inside the premises and a vast majority of them wanted to leave immediately but were being prevented by lathi-wielding supporters of the ‘godman’. Kalawati Devi, a native of Satna in Madhya Pradesh, told Mail Today that she was willing to get out earlier, but that the Sant’s followers had held her seven-year-old daughter inside the ashram. She had been searching for her in vain all day. The whole of Barwala town turned into a war zone, and the police did not allow even local residents to walk or ply vehicles on major roads. Only police, ambulances and fire tenders could be seen on the roads. Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar was also closely monitoring the situation and was being given constant updates, his OSD, Jawahar Yadav said in Chandigarh. Scores of Sant Rampal followers held a demonstration at Jantar Mantar in Delhi on November 18, demanding that police withdraw from the Hisar ashram . ‘Rampal being targeted to please Arya Samajis’ By Manjeet Sehgal in Chandigarh . With the Haryana Police struggling to arrest godman Sant Rampal at Hisar’s Satlok Ashram as his supporters guard him at the 12-acre ashram-turned-fortress, his followers on Tuesday alleged the crackdown was only to appease the upper caste Arya Samajis of the state. The ashram management alleged the police and administration have targeted Sant Rampal and his followers for 15 years, but let off Arya Samajis despite them attacking the ashram time and again. Satlok Ashram spokesperson Raj Kapoor on Tuesday told Mail Today by phone: “I am in the ashram. Followers, including women and children, are injured. There are four bodies of women before me. I want to ask the administration why we are only targeted and Rampal is not allowed video conferencing when the head of another sect can make over 100 video conference appearances?” Solidarity: Female followers of the godman pray as they gather to show support in Delhi . He claimed cases against Rampal are all fabricated and added that the previous government, during the tenure of which the cases were registered, almost tried to ‘finish’ Rampal. “Former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, himself a follower of Arya Samaj, got the false cases registered. No action was taken against those who attacked the Satlok Ashram, but Hooda rewarded them with plum posts,” Kapoor said. Meanwhile, AAP leader Yogendra Yadav said on Tuesday that the Haryana government has been pursuing different policies for different Babas. He said the state government bowed before a baba facing criminal charges while it is acting against another. The AAP has demanded a judicial probe into Tuesday’s action, which left many journalists and Rampal’s followers injured. Haryana Director General of Police S. N. Vashisth on Tuesday said that the Haryana Police operation at Satlok Ashram will continue till Rampal is arrested. The DGP said that when the police team started the operation, the followers fired gunshots, pelted stones and threw acid bombs on the police personnel, due to which about 105 personnel were injured. “It is unfortunate that some journalists have been injured,” he added. The DGP said the police are taking every step very carefully to prevent any casualty. He added that phone calls from the ashram have revealed that many supporters have been forcibly kept inside. In reply to a question, Vashisth said that followers inside the ashram have guns, revolvers and pistols, and some of them are retired police personnel and ex-servicemen. Vashisth added: “We have nothing to hide which is why we granted permission to 86 media persons to cover the operation.” The DGP assured that an independent inquiry would be conducted to nail the policemen who attacked mediapersons.","Haryana Police launched a huge assault in bid to arrest controversial godman Rampal .

"A terrified dog that was left for dead in a park with his legs tied up with electrical cables has found a new home after the ordeal. Spencer, a boxer cross, was found abandoned and with his legs trussed together in a park in Norwich and had to be rescued by police earlier this year. The animal was taken to a rescue centre after the ordeal but now appears relaxed and happy with his new owner Simon Oddy. Simon Oddy has given Spencer the boxer dog, who was found abandoned in a park in Norwich with his legs tied with electrical cable so he could not stand, a new home in Peterborough and said he seems happy . Mr Oddy, 37, of Peterborough in Cambridgeshire, decided to adopt Spencer after he learned of his ordeal online. 'I just love him to bits,' said Mr Oddy. 'You wouldn't have thought Spencer's been through such a traumatic experience. 'He's so placid and happy.' Spencer was rescued on August 30 after police were called to Sloughbottom Park following reports of a dog that had been hog tied. He was found bound with household electrical cable and with his collar tied up with string and binding his legs so he could not stand. Spencer was discovered hog-tied in August, with household electrical cables binding his feet together . Spencer was named after the police officer who put his coat around the rescued animal to keep him warm . The dog, believed to be around four years old, was named after the police officer who found him and put his coat around the animal to keep him warm. Mr Oddy added: 'As soon as we saw him on the website we wanted him - he charmed us instantly. 'We hadn't heard then about his terrible past, but we looked at the links and saw the story and it just made us want him more. Spencer is now relaxed and happy in his new home . 'It is amazing how trusting dogs can be - they seem to move on and forgive and forget so quickly. 'Most humans would be slow to trust if something like that had happened to them. 'But Spencer just wags his tail and bounds over in his friendly way to all he meets.' Mr Oddy, whose parents run an animal rescue centre in Northampton, said he wants to encourage other people to adopt rescued animals like Spencer. Spencer was taken to an RSPCA centre for specialist care after he was found. Laura Sayer, an inspector with the RSPCA, said she was 'delighted' that Spencer had found a new home after his ordeal in the park, when the animal had been left for dead. She said: 'He is such a lovely dog and was so sweet and loving from the word go that it does not surprise me that someone fell in love with him so quickly. 'It is the best part of our job when we reach such happy endings - it just makes everything so worthwhile.'","Spencer, a boxer cross, was found with his legs bound with electrical cable .

"Almost 36million people across the globe are living as modern day slaves where they are born into servitude, trafficked for sex work, trapped in debt bondage or exploited for forced labour. The Walk Free Foundation's annual slavery index last year estimated 29.8million people were living as modern day slaves with Mauritania, Uzbekistan, Haiti, Qatar and India among the nations where it is most prevalent. But the Australia-based human rights group this year increased its estimate  to 35.8 million, in light of better data collection and slavery being uncovered in areas where it had not been found previously. For the second year, the index of 167 countries found India had by far the greatest number of slaves. India (pictured) has up to 14.3million people living as slaves, according to the annual global slavery report. Stock image used . Haiti (pictured) is among the countries where modern day slavery is most prevalent. The country's practice of sending poor children to stay with richer acquaintances routinely leads to abuse . Up to 14.3million people in its population of 1.25 billion were victims of slavery, ranging from prostitution to bonded labour. Mauritania was again the country where slavery was most prevalent by head of population while Qatar, host of the 2022 World Cup, rose up the rank from 96th place to be listed as the fourth worst country by percentage of the population. 'From children denied an education by being forced to work or marry early, to men unable to leave their work because of crushing debts they owe to recruitment agents, to women and girls exploited as unpaid, abused domestic workers, modern slavery has many faces,' the report said. 'It still exists today, in every country - modern slavery affects us all.' The index defines slavery as the control or possession of people in such a way as to deprive them of their freedom with the intention of exploiting them for profit or sex, usually through violence, coercion or deception. The definition includes indentured servitude, forced marriage and the abduction of children to serve in wars. Hereditary slavery is deeply entrenched in the West African country of Mauritania, where four percent of the population of 3.9 million is estimated to be enslaved, the report said. After Mauritania, slavery was most prevalent in Uzbekistan, where citizens are forced to pick cotton every year to meet state-imposed cotton quotas, and Haiti, where the practice of sending poor children to stay with richer acquaintances or relatives routinely leads to abuse and forced labour, it said. Qatar (pictured) is among the countries to have a high numbers of slaves. It has a large number of migrant workers, often living in dreadful conditions, working on infrastructure for the 2022 Football World Cup . Uzbekistan forces its citizens to pick cotton every year to meet state-imposed quotas. Pictured is a refugee camp on the border with Kyrgystan . Unsurprisingly, ranked fourth was Qatar. The tiny Gulf state relies heavily on migrants to build its mega-projects including soccer stadiums for the 2022 World Cup. It has come under scrutiny by rights groups over its treatment of migrant workers, most from Asia, who come to toil on construction sites, oil projects or work as domestic help. The next highest prevalence rates were found in India, Pakistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, Syria and Central African Republic. The index showed that 10 countries alone account for 71 percent of the world's slaves. After India, China has the most with 3.2 million, then Pakistan (2.1 million), Uzbekistan (1.2 million), Russia (1.05 million), Nigeria (834,200), Democratic Republic of Congo (762,900), Indonesia (714,100), Bangladesh (680,900) and Thailand (475,300). For the first time, the index rated governments on their response to slavery. It found the Netherlands, followed by Sweden, the United States, Australia, Switzerland, Ireland, Norway, Britain, Georgia and Austria had the strongest response. Countries such as Syria and Iraq also registered increases in slavery following the atrocities committed by militant groups such as ISIS (pictured) in the past year . At the opposite end of the scale, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Eritrea, Central African Republic, Libya, Equatorial Guinea, Uzbekistan, Republic of Congo and Iraq had the worst responses. Every country in the world apart from North Korea has laws that criminalise some form of slavery, yet most governments could do more to assist victims and root out slavery from supply chains, Walk Free Foundation's head of global research said. 'What the results show is that a lot is being done on paper but it's not necessarily translating into results,' Fiona David said. 'Most countries got 50 percent or less when we looked at the strength of their victim assistance regime. It's also striking that ... out of 167 countries we could only find three (Australia, Brazil and the United States) where governments have put things in place on supply chains.' The report showed that conflict had a direct impact on the prevalence of slavery, she said, citing the example of the Islamic State militant group which has abducted women and girls in Iraq and Syria for use as sex slaves. 'What our numbers show is the correlation really is quite strong so as an international community, we need to make planning for this kind of problem as part of the humanitarian response to crisis situations.'","Number of people living as slaves has increased six million since last year .

"A baby has overcome a one-in-five-million brain condition – after a blob of medical superglue saved his life. Just weeks after he was born, Jack Jones was diagnosed with rare condition called Vein of Galen Malformation, and needed life-saving surgery to relieve pressure in his brain. Surgeons performed a technique to plug a leak in his brain which would have killed him if left untreated, using Histoacryl, a medical form of superglue. He has now made a full recovery and is back at home with his parents in Merseyside. Emma Rigby, 26 and her partner Kelvin Jones, 46, were terrified when their baby Jack Jones, now five months old, was diagnosed with a rare and serious condition called Vein of Galen Malformation . Baby Jack underwent a six hour operation to relieve pressure in his brain. Doctors blocked off a malformed vein using Histoacryl, a medical form of superglue. He is now recovering at home with his parents . Doctors told Jack's parents there was a two-thirds chance he would survive the operation, but he would die without it . Mr Jones (pictured left with baby Jack) and Ms Rigby (pictured right with her son) rushed 200 miles from their home to a hospital in Glasgow, where they were told Jack would need life saving surgery.  Ms Rigby said: 'We had no idea if he was going to make it and I didn't want to leave his side.' Jack, who is now five months old, was diagnosed in August after a health visitor noticed the circumference of his head was 43.2cm, which is 2cm bigger than an average baby. His mother Emma Rigby, 26, from  St Helens, Merseyside, said: 'Who knew that measuring Jack's head would save his life. 'He had no other symptoms of the condition, so we're lucky that Louise, the health visitor, spotted it. 'At first, we brushed it off, because he'd always had a big head, but now I'm glad we listened.' Ms Rigby took Jack to Whiston Hospital in St Helens,  where doctors agreed his head was big but, unconcerned, sent him home. The next morning, Ms Rigby,who works at a care home, received a phone call from a second doctor asking that they return that day for an ultrasound to rule out anything concerning. This time doctors found fluid on Jack's brain and realised the situation was serious. Ms Rigby said: 'The next thing I knew, we were transferred to Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool where Jack had further scans.' At just six weeks old, Jack was diagnosed with Vein of Galen Malformation, a rare brain condition that only affects 10-12 babies in the UK every year. The vein of Galen is the brain’s major vein, which drains blood from the brain back to the heart. Sometimes an abnormal connection between a vein near the vein of Galen and arteries supplying the brain with blood allows blood to flow rapidly from these arteries into the vein of Galen malformation. The increased pressure means the blood flows faster and at higher pressure than usual. This leads to the Vein of Galen swelling, which can lead to brain damage. As the heart needs to work harder to account for this additional blood flow through the vein of Galen malformation, it can also lead to heart failure. This in turn can cause an increased workload on the lungs, liver or kidneys, which may cause them to fail as well. The symptoms vary from child to child when they develop symptoms of a VGM. Some children develop problems soon after birth, while others develop them later in childhood. Sometimes children do not run into problems until later in life. If this is the case, possible symptoms are an enlarged head, seizures (fits or convulsions), or, rarely, bleeding into the brain. In the UK, between 10 and 12 children are diagnosed with Vein of Galen Malformation each year. Source: Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, UK . The condition occurs when missing capillaries in the brain increase the blood pressure, meaning the brain has less time to absorb nutrients. The increased pressure leads to the brain's major vein, the Vein of Galen, swelling, with often devastating results such as heart failure or brain damage. Shocked, Ms Rigby called her partner Kelvin Jones, 46, who rushed to the hospital. 'We were really panicking,' Ms Rigby said. ''The consultant told me Jack's condition could cause heart failure and said it would have killed him had it gone undiagnosed. 'It was really serious, they were very concerned for his wellbeing. 'I was shocked at the diagnosis. My baby was tiny, he was going through so much and I was thinking the worst.' For the first-time parents, the next two days were extremely frightening. The couple were transferred 200 miles to Yorkhill Children's Hospital in Glasgow, so Jack could see international neuro-radiologist Dr Jo Bhattacharya. Ms Rigby said: 'When we left for Scotland, all I had with me were my pyjamas. 'At that point, we had no idea if he was going to make it and I didn't want to leave his side.' The next morning, Dr Bhattacharya explained Jack would need life-saving surgery to decrease pressure in his brain. Ms Rigby said: 'We were so worked up. Jack only had two-thirds chance of surviving the operation, but he would die without it, so we had no choice.' During the operation, Dr Bhattacharya blocked off the malformed and swollen Vein Of Galen in Jack's brain by going through a vessel in his groin which led there. He blocked it off with a blob of glue called Histoacryl, similar to superglue. The six hour operation was a success and a day later, Jack was back to his normal self. Now he is back home and is thriving, although he will need check-ups for the rest of his life. Ms Rigby said: 'We couldn't be happier. Looking at him, you'd think there had never been anything wrong. It feels like a dream. 'We never thought superglue could be used in that way and I'd never heard of such a technique. 'But we just want to thank Louise and Dr Bhattacharya as without them, Jack wouldn't be here. We're so grateful.' Ms Rigby also praised the NHS for their efficiency and care. Dr Jo Bhattacharya, a neuro-radiologist, is pictured with Jack Jones after his six-hour operation in Yorkhill Children's Hospital, Glasgow . She said: 'Everything was sorted so quickly and the nurses were brilliant, they made us feel at home and even let us sleep in the one of the wards. They cared for and supported us as well as Jack.' Dr Bhattacharya said the condition is extremely rare, and was surprised that Jack recovered so quickly. He said: 'In the UK just 10 to 12 babies are diagnosed with the condition every year and usually within the first few hours of being born. 'It's extremely rare and a one in five million condition. 'Jack was diagnosed at six weeks without any symptoms, which is unusual, but his good health otherwise meant he recovered quickly. 'Had Jack's condition not been found, I think his brain would have started to suffer and become progressively damaged, leading to death or very serious brain damage.'","A health visitor noticed Jack Jones' head was 2cm bigger than average .

"A model village in a widow's garden that fell into disrepair after the death of her husband has been restored to its former glory by  volunteers. Great-grandmother Pat Bullman and her husband Oliver, both 80, spent over 50 years creating the miniature attraction at their home in Wicken, Cambridgeshire. They started with a windmill for their daughter and gradually added other buildings, including a fire station, railway station, hotel, fish and chip shop and church. Pat Bullman's model village built in her garden in Wicken, Cambridgeshire, has been restored by volunteers . Great-grandmother Mrs Bullman and her husband Oliver spent over 50 years creating the miniature attraction . But after it fell into disrepair, Mrs Bullman asked volunteers to help bring it back to its former glory . Two volunteers have now helped to recreate the village and bring it back to life with new characters and buildings . There are also new picnic benches (pictured) on which new characters in the village can sit . Beverley Lorking, 73, from Ely and Tony Middleton, who is in his 60s, from Cambridge helped with the project . But, after Mr Bullman died in 2012, the wooden models began rotting away. With Mrs Bullman was too frail to keep it up, she issued an appeal for people to help her save the village. Beverley Lorking, 73, from Ely  and Tony Middleton, who is in his 60s, from Cambridge came forward to help and used their skills as former toolmakers to bring the model village back to life.

I really hope I can attract the children and families again.' Mr. Bullman, who worked as a digger driver, was still making new pieces for the village when he died from  cancer at the age of 80.

"Sweden's much-loved Pippi Longstocking children books have been branded racist by a leading German theologian. Dr Eske Wollrad, from Germany's Federal Association of Evangelical Women, has called on parents to skip certain passages or else explain to their children that they contain outdated colonial stereotypes. She hit out at the Pippi Longstocking trilogy, written by author Astrid Lindgren and first published in 1945, at an anti-discrimination state conference in Leipzig at the weekend. Racist? Inger Nilsson as Pippi Longstocking in the 1969 TV series. A German theologian has criticised the books have been criticised for containing colonial stereotypes . The Vatican yesterday dubbed comic book character-turned-silver screen action hero Tintin a 'Catholic hero' and ridiculed suggestions he may be racist. In its official newspaper L'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican published a picture of the children's hero beneath one of Pope Benedict XVI and then carried a double page article inside praising Tintin and his faithful dog Snowy. L'Osservatore said that accusing the fearless journalist of racism was the 'imagining of an integralist political correctness' after some bookshops in the UK banished Tintin In The Congo to the top shelf and wrapped copies in plastic. Publishers have carried out the draconian measures - including warning labels on the cover - because they fear the book may have a negative effect on young children bracketing it the same was as a pornographic magazine. Dr Wollrad told German newspaper The Local: 'It is not that the figure of Pippi Longstocking is racist, but that all three in the trilogy of books have colonial racist stereotypes.' In the books, Pippi is an eight-year-old with superhuman strength who does not want to grow up and hates pompous adults. Her father, once a king of a South Seas island, was originally known as Negro King before publishers changed it to South Seas King. Dr Wollrad is demanding the book's publisher make additions in the books to guide readers when 'racist' content arises. She said that in the third book, Pippi In The South Seas: 'The black children throw themselves into the sand in front of the white children in the book. When reading the book to my nephew, who is black, I simply left that passage out.' She added: 'The question to ask yourself is whether you could read a certain passage out loud to a black child without stopping or stumbling. Only then can you say whether it is OK or not.' But Dr Wollrad did praise the trilogy for its feminist and pro-child innovations, a rarity in the 1940s. She said: 'I would certainly not condemn the book completely - on the contrary, there are many very positive aspects to it. Astrid Lindgren (left) died in 2002 aged 94. Dr Eske Wollrad (right) has called on parents to skip certain . passages in the Pippi Longstocking books or else explain to their children that they contain outdated . colonial stereotypes . Literary phenomenon: The Pippi Longstocking trilogy became popular around the world following its original publication in the 1940s . 'As . well as being very funny, it is instructive for children as it not only . has a strong female character... and she is fiercely opposed to . violence against animals.' Astrid Lindgren died in 2002 aged 94. She remains best known for her three Pippi Longstocking books - Pippi Longstocking (1945), Pippi Goes On Board (1946) and Pippi In The South Seas (1948). She wrote the first of the trilogy following a request from her unwell nine-year-old daughter Karen for a 'get well story'. The books swiftly became a Swedish phenomenon and have been adapted numerous times for film and television.",Swedish trilogy contains 'colonial stereotypes'
"The Ohio hospital where the nation's first face transplant was carried out in December 2008 has successfully completed its second such operation almost six year later. Surgeons at the Cleveland Clinic have replaced nearly the entire face of a middle-aged man severely disfigured in a car accident, the hospital announced on Tuesday. The hospital said the operation took place in late September and the recipient wants to remain anonymous. Scroll down for video . Surgeons at the Cleveland Clinic have replaced nearly the entire face of a middle-aged man severely disfigured in a car accident, the hospital announced on Tuesday . In a statement released by the hospital on Tuesday, the man said he is 'grateful beyond words to the donor and his family for their amazing gift.' The patient became a candidate for a face transplant after many tries to reconstruct his face failed to improve his quality of life, the hospital said in a statement. The man had trouble breathing and speaking, and the transplant offered the chance to save the limited sight in his sole remaining eye. Doctors transplanted about two-thirds of the scalp, the forehead, upper and lower eyelids, eye sockets, nose, upper cheeks, upper jaw, upper teeth, salivary glands and nerves, muscles and skin. The patient is recovering well, breathing without a tube and is expected to be able to eat soon, the hospital said. He will need medicines for the rest of his life to prevent rejection of the new face. The Cleveland Clinic did the nation's first face transplant on Connie Culp in December 2008. The Cleveland Clinic carried out the nation's first face transplant on Connie Culp in December 2008 . Doctors work during transplant surgery to replace nearly the entire face of a middle-aged man severely disfigured in a car accident - the recipient wishes to remain anonymous . Dr. Maria Siemionow, who led the surgery, is now at the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine and consulted with the Cleveland Clinic on the most recent face transplant, and co-led the operation with Dr. Frank Papay, chairman of the Dermatology and Plastic Surgery Institute at the clinic. The U.S. Department of Defense is providing money for these surgeries in hopes of helping soldiers disfigured in battle. Recipients have included Charla Nash, a Connecticut woman who was mauled by a chimpanzee. Her transplant was one of five done at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston; the University of Maryland Medical Center has also done one. The University of Pittsburgh, the University of California, Los Angeles, and other medical centers also plan to offer face or hand transplants under the military program. More than two dozen face transplants have been done around the world, starting in 2005 with a French woman mauled by her dog. So far, only two face transplant-related deaths have been reported. One was a Chinese man who reportedly was not given or did not take medicines to prevent his body from rejecting his new face. The other was in Paris, a man who received a face and a double hand transplant. He suffered a heart attack during surgery for a complication.

"Gavin Dunnicliffe, 30, from Derby, was sentenced to six years in jail in Derbyshire Crown Court for the violent assault on his victim which his lawyer described to the court as '54 seconds of madness' A video has captured the moment a thug attacked a man with piping and beat him 55 times in 54 seconds. Gavin Dunnicliffe, 30, from Derby, was jailed for six years for the violent assault which his lawyer called '54 seconds of madness'. His victim was left with head wounds, a broken arm and fingers and cuts to his legs and back. The video shows Dunnicliffe striking his victim for almost a minute without pausing. Derbyshire Crown Court heard yesterday that Dunnicliffe was in a relationship with the ex-partner of his victim, a 47-year-old taxi driver. The attack was so violent Derbyshire Police originally charged him with attempted murder - later downgraded to causing grievous bodily harm with intent to which Dunnicliffe pleaded guilty yesterday. Jailing him, Judge John Burgess said: 'You told police the weapon was a length of rubber or plastic piping. 'If that had been a metal bar this man would be dead and you would be facing a murder charge. 'What you did that night was quite terrible, a sustained and powerful attack and as we saw on the CCTV sometimes you were holding that weapon with both hands. 'He suffered serious injuries which saw him stay in hospital for three days and then there are the mental scars he has suffered. 'This offence involved a degree of planning and it involved the use of a weapon. 'It was a sustained assault.' Mark Van Der Zwart, prosecuting, at Derby Crown Court, said that the attack happened shortly before midnight on December 15 last year. He said the victim had been involved in a confrontation with the woman's daughter, Jade Austin, the previous night outside a nightclub in Derby. Mr Van Der Zwart said: 'On the night in question, Mr Dunnicliffe had set off to find him and attack him. Precisely why he should go out on this mission is not plain.' He said the victim had been drinking in two pubs and Dunnicliffe had been in both pubs asking people if they had seen him. Scroll down for video . Mr Dunnicliffe, pictured assaulting the man in the street with a pipe, attacked his victim after the man had had a confrontation with his partner's daughter the previous night outside a nightclub in Derby, the court heard . He said: 'The victim went to the Yaadgaar takeaway in Littleover and left shortly before midnight. 'The defendant followed him on to South Avenue where the attack took place. 'In a victim impact statement, the victim tells how he has been left with a visible dent in his head from his injury and that he suffers flashbacks. He feels on edge and there are mental scars.' Alwyn Jones, for Dunnicliffe, said his client 'wholeheartedly accepts what he did was wrong' and that it was 'unforgiveable and atrocious'. Mr Jones said: 'He knows he must suffer for the 54 seconds of madness we have seen on the screen. 'His progress during his time in custody shows that, as and when the prison gates open, he has the potential to be a valuable member of society. There is a reference from the prison chaplain.' 'There is no excuse for how he behaved and he accepts that he went out that night to confront the victim.

"An exclusive hotel has banned alcohol and pork after being taken over by a Middle Eastern businessman who wants to run it ‘in accordance with Sharia law’. The strict Islamic policy was imposed without warning this week at London’s Bermondsey Square Hotel – where the bar and grill was previously run by Masterchef judge Gregg Wallace. Staff said the new rules were swiftly implemented on Tuesday on the orders of the new Muslim owner, forcing waiters to tell disgruntled guests that much of the menu was no longer available. Scroll down for video . London’s Bermondsey Square Hotel (pictured) has banned alcohol and pork after being taken over by a Middle Eastern businessman who wants to run it ‘in accordance with Sharia law’ Diners were denied dishes that used only traces of alcohol – such as beer-battered fish, a pudding with ‘drunken cherries’ and rum ice cream. Drinkers were offered only non-alcoholic beer and elderflower cordial. Forced to improvise, chefs are now trying to source chicken and beef sausages instead of pork varieties for breakfast and have replaced the popular hog roast with rabbit terrine. The £220-a-night hotel is believed to be one of the first in the country to introduce the strict Muslim policy but staff say the changes have caused business to plummet, with many reservations cancelled. Several fear for their jobs unless the hotel – previously voted the UK’s trendiest place to stay and where Gordon Ramsay once filmed a show – is marketed for a different clientele. An IT consultant, who has been a regular at the hotel, said: ‘A group of us were meant to be meeting in the bar and they said: “We can’t serve alcohol any more.” 'When I contacted the manager to ask why, he told me that the new owner wanted it to be a Sharia law hotel. Under Sharia law, you can’t make a profit from alcohol.’ The guest said he would no longer book the hotel in future, adding: ‘They’ve got to be careful. It’s been quiet and this is almost the death knell.’ The strict Islamic policy was imposed without warning this week at London’s Bermondsey Square Hotel – where the bar and grill was previously run by Masterchef judge Gregg Wallace (pictured) On community website london-se1, a poster called Drgreenmark2 said customers were ‘kicking off’, adding: ‘Who on earth believes a “dry” hotel and restaurant is going to work in central London, never mind Bermondsey square? This is not Saudi Arabia!’ Gavin Smith posted: ‘I’m a teetotaller but think the no alcohol and no pork policy is too prescriptive. What next? Are guests in the linked hotel going to be asked to provide marriage certificates if they want a double room? Are same-sex couples going to be refused entry?’ The change was so swift that the hotel’s website and menus have not yet been updated and the venue still bills itself as the place to stay for ‘party people, foodies and fashionistas’. Menus for the GB Bar and Grill still offer full English breakfast with sweetcure streaky bacon and Cumberland sausage, and roast pork belly with black pudding. The restaurant boasts of ‘signature British dishes’ but even the children’s option of sausage and chips will now have to be changed to meet the new policy. The hotel website also continues to boast of champagne receptions, its ‘inviting cocktail bar’ and is illustrated with pictures of guests drinking beer. Customers calling to make reservations are warned they will not be allowed to order beer, wine or spirits because the hotel is under ‘new management’. However, they can buy alcohol from outside and drink it in their rooms. Several staff at the hotel did not know the new owner’s identity and had been told only that he was from the Middle East. Some were puzzled by the new policy at such short notice as the hotel does not have a significant Muslim clientele and the food is not halal. Nearby restaurants said they saw a surge in business when customers walked out of the hotel’s grill on Tuesday. The Village East Brasserie said it had 12 extra diners who specifically asked: ‘Do you serve alcohol because the hotel we are staying in doesn’t?’ Masterchef judge Wallace, who ran the hotel bar and grill until last year, said last night: ‘It doesn’t bother me what the owner wants to do. ‘It’s his religious point of view not to serve alcohol and pork and I respect that. I stay at the hotel and if I want to drink I go elsewhere.’ The hotel was also the setting for Channel 4’s Hotel GB in 2012 when Gordon Ramsay, Mary Portas and Gok Wan competed to run the venue for charity. It was voted the trendiest in the UK by TripAdvisor in 2010 and rock stars are among those who have sampled its 80 designer bedrooms, which include loft rooms overlooking London’s skyline. Robert Holland of Bespoke Hotels, which has operated the hotel since it opened in 2009, said decisions were made to change ‘some elements of the business’ ‘These are in the best interests of the future of the hotel,’ he said. ‘We always have, and continue to, welcome guests of all shapes, sizes and denomination.’ Bespoke Hotels also operates the La Suite West hotel in Bayswater, West London, which does not serve alcohol and has a vegan restaurant.","Strict Islamic policy is imposed at London's Bermondsey Square Hotel .

"The family of a mother who was found beaten to death by her husband six hours after a neighbor called 911 for help have filed a lawsuit against the city of Denver. Loretta Barela's heartbroken relatives said in a federal lawsuit filed on Monday that the 44-year-old might have survived if dispatchers had sent police sooner. A neighbor called 911 around 2am on November 18, 2012 to report seeing a shirtless Barela being punched and dragged across the street by a man. When police failed to arrive after 45 minutes, the neighbor called 911 again. Attack: Loretta Barela, left, was beaten to death by her husband Christopher Perea, right, in November 2012. A concerned neighbor called 911 at 2am but her body was not discovered until 8.15am . Scene: Officers showed up at the home an hour after the first 911 call but knocked on the couple's door, pictured, but left after no one answered. Perea called cops himself hours later to report the killing . Officers finally arrived around 3am and knocked on the front door and shone lights through a window but left when no one answered. Eventually, Barela's husband, 41-year-old Christopher Perea, called authorities to say he believed he had killed his wife. He said her body was 'cold' and that her jaw was 'stiff'. Her beaten body was found inside their home around 8.15am. Perea was arrested and later convicted in her murder. 'I just want to know why they didn't do anything about it,' he daughter Marie Cruz said to 9news at the time. 'She is tiny. She's only 90 pounds getting beaten by a man.' The lawsuit names the city of Denver, four 911 employees and two officers, who they say failed to thoroughly investigate before leaving 18 minutes after they arrived. At the time, Fox31 reported that police sources said they can only kick in a door when it appears to be an emergency, but it was unknown how much the officers knew. Heartbroken: Her daughter, left, and sister, right, said after the attack that they wanted to know why officers failed to help Barela. The family has now filed a lawsuit against the city, dispatchers and police officers . The lawsuit also says that the dispatchers ignored the urgency of the neighbor's calls reporting a life-threatening emergency. At least one dispatcher resigned. 'Somebody can find another job but you can't replace my mom, you really can't,' her tearful daughter told Fox31. The case was among several recent problems at the 911 center. In April 2012, a 911 caller reporting a threatening situation was told Denver police wouldn't take a report unless he returned to city limits. He returned to Denver and was killed within blocks of the earlier incident. And this April, Denver police officials said they were delayed saving a woman after a dispatcher who failed to relay information to officers about the gravity of the situation. In that case, Kristine Kirk frantically called 911 saying her husband Richard was hallucinating after eating marijuana-infused candy and was getting a gun from a safe. Failed: In another Denver case, Kristine Kirk, left, called 911 saying her husband Richard, right, was threatening to shoot her after eating marijuana-infused candy. She was shot after a slow police response . She was shot dead more than 12 minutes into her 911 call. Officials made several changes to their response policies after Kirk's killing, including requiring dispatchers to give certain calls, such as those involving weapons, the highest priority. The new rules also give officers more authority to decide how to respond to calls in which a person is in imminent danger. The suit says the cases show 'a widespread custom or policy of failing to identify and/or prioritize situations involving imminent danger or a life threatening emergency'. City Attorney Scott Martinez said late on Monday that he had not seen the lawsuit and he could not comment.","A neighbor called 911 after seeing a man hit Loretta Barela and drag her across a Denver street in November 2012 .

"Dozens of people took to Twitter to voice their outrage at Ken Brown's comment . The BBC was last night facing another sports commentary controversy after veteran golf commentator Ken Brown was accused of making a racist comment on the British Open. As Tiger Woods and Lee Westwood prepared to start the 12th hole, Mr Brown – who represented Europe in the Ryder Cup five times during the 1970s and 1980s – said: ‘This fairway runs like an Ethiopian chicken... it just runs.’ Last night dozens of people took to Twitter to voice their disgust at the outburst. Shaun Murphy, English 2005 world snooker champion, wrote: ‘Did Ken Brown just say that? This fairway runs like an Ethiopian chicken? What does that mean? The snooker player later added: ‘funny way to announce his retirement I thought’. The BBC’s Wimbledon presenter John Inverdale was this month forced to make an apology to the 2013 women’s champion Marion Bartoli after saying she ‘was never going to be a looker’. There were 674 complaints, sparking Culture Secretary Maria Miller to call for further action against Inverdale. BBC Director-General Tony Hall last week branded Inverdale’s insensitive comments ‘unacceptable’. It  is unclear whether Mr Brown will be asked to apologise. The 56-year-old has worked for the BBC for 20 years since retiring from golf in his 30s. The BBC did not respond to  a request for comment.

Friends . say Juliet Obasuyi was worried Michael Adebowale was turning against the family and wanted him to . have 'spiritual guidance' before he radicalised himself. The 43-year-old was often left in tears after speaking to her son and would approach neighbours and friends for help. Worried: Juliet Obasuyi, the mother of one of the men suspected of butchering a British solider on a south London street, desperately attempted to turn him against extremism . Troubled: The mother of Michael Adebowale, 22, desperately attempted to turn him against extremism. He is pictured with a knife in his hand at the scene where Lee Rigby was stabbed to death . One of her neighbours said Mrs Obasuyi went to him about nine months ago after her son dropped out of university. According to the Daily Telegraph, Mrs . Obasuyi told her 62-year-old security officer neighbour that her son . was not listening anymore. 'His . older sister is a good Christian with a degree but Michael is rebelling . as he has no father figure, dropping out of university and handing out . leaflets in Woolwich town centre. 'He . is from a strong Christian family but he is turning to Islam and . turning against the family. He needs spiritual guidance before he . radicalises himself.” Another friend of Mrs Obasuyi, Steve Adebiyi, told the newspaper that Adebowale was giving his mother problems. 'They brainwashed him,' he said. Problems: It has been claimed that  Adebowale became radicalised after trying to escape gangland 'trouble'. This picture shows Macey House, in Greenwich, south east London where Adebowale is registered as a voter . Weapon: This battered car was used to crush Drummer Lee Rigby against a sign The streak of blood in front shows how his body was dragged  into the street . Rant: A man identified as Michael Adebolajo, 28, . brandishes a meat cleaver with bloodied hands near the scene of the . killing. It was claimed last night that MI5 offered Adebolajo a job six . months ago . Meanwhile, the father of murdered schoolboy Damilola Taylor said tonight that he had acted as a mentor to Adebowale, who was known to his friends as Toby. Asked about Wednesday's events, Richard Taylor told ITV News: 'I was terribly shocked at what I saw that day. 'It's a different Toby or Michael that I was seeing that day. I don't believe it was anything Islamic.' Mr Taylor, whose son was just ten when he was killed in the capital in 2000, said he had tried to help Adebowale after he was bullied at school and then became involved in drugs and gangs. But he said that when he spoke to Adebowale two months ago, he told him that he had changed his ways as he had become a Muslim. He went on: 'Having seen how my own son was stabbed to death, made me feel that... whatever happens, they will still be alive, they will still be on the street or maybe they will take them away from the public or change their faces. They don't deserve to live.' Mr Taylor said he had also known Adebowale's mother, who he said was a probation officer, while he said his father was a representative in the Nigerian High Commission. Career: Drummer Rigby, 25, known as 'Riggers', was known as a brave soldier . He has been arrested by police . officers along with Michael Adebolajo after Drummer Lee Rigby was . brutally killed in Woolwich on Wednesday. It was also claimed yesterday that Michael Adebowale became radicalised after trying to escape gangland ‘trouble’. London-born Adebowale was told to ‘disappear’ after he was caught up with a local gang known as the Woolwich Boys, and underwent a dramatic change of personality. Once a fun-loving schoolboy who was described as ‘always smiling’ and chatted to neighbours about Jamie Oliver recipes, he began dressing in traditional Islamic dress and preaching a radical message of hate. Adebowale gave up alcohol and began distributing radical leaflets near his mother’s home in Greenwich, south-east London. Neighbours said his Nigerian-born mother, Juliet Obasuyi, was a probation officer and a ‘hard-working’ Christian woman who raised Adebowale alone after separating from his father. Police raided her flat and a property linked to Adebowale’s father, Adeniyi Adebowale, in Holloway, North London. Plain-clothes officers were seen carrying six plastic bags full of video cassettes and audio tapes from the Holloway flat. The videos appeared to be labelled as football matches but one line of inquiry for police is likely to be whether Adebowale was interested in the type of jihadi videos watched by the July 2005 London bombers. The four bombers were linked to an extreme bookshop in Leeds which distributed videos of terrorist acts, exhorting followers to emulate them. Michael Oluwatobi Adebowale was born to Nigerian parents in Denmark Hill, South London, in May 1991. His father was then a student at Rutherford College in Canterbury, Kent, and the couple were said to have separated soon after the birth. Adebowale attended Kidbrooke School in Greenwich, where former pupils said he was known as Toby or Tobi, an abbreviation of his second name Oluwatobi. Adebowale was said to have converted to Islam at 19, while studying at Greenwich University, where he met the other Woolwich suspect, Michael Adebolajo. Family friend Madeleine Edwards, 49, said Adebowale had been in ‘some serious gangland trouble’ in 2010 and that his mother had told her he ‘had to disappear for a while’. She said Adebowale’s father was a ‘typical African gentleman’ but his mother had struggled to control her wayward son. Adebowale was said to have left the Greenwich area for a year and returned about eight months ago, wearing traditional Islamic garb and a white skull cap, typically worn by Muslim men who have been on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. A neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Michael would always say hello and play with my children, but in the last year he stopped. He would just ignore us when we saw him at the lift. ‘He used to talk to me very enthusiastically about cooking and his recipes. He loved Jamie Oliver and had his books.

"For decades they came to espouse their vile  politics, but now locals in a town in Germany have tricked neo-Nazi marchers into raising €10,000 to help them drop out of right-wing extremism. The protesters gather annually in Wunsiedel in Bavaria to visit the grave of Rudolph Hess, Adolf Hitler's deputy. This year, residents decided to donate €10 for every metre the marchers walked. Rights versus Rights (Rechts gegen Rechts), the counter-protest by the locals, are donating their funds to Exit Germany. The programme aids people who want to escape fascist movements. Scroll down for video . Right-wing gatherers travel annually to Wunsiedel in Bavaria to pay their respects to the grave of Rudolph Hess - but this year they unwittingly donated to a programme which helps people escape from extremism . One organiser, Fabian Wichmann, told German news agency DPA: ‘We want to show what else you can do, what other courses of action you have. ‘You can do more than just block the street or close the shutters.’ Campaigners in Wunsiedel only unveiled their novel approach to the neo-Nazis when the some 250 marchers arrived last Saturday to pay their respects to Hess and tip their hat to the Third Reich. Campaigners threw confetti, gave out bananas and even hung out brightly coloured banners with humorous slogans such as ‘if only the Führer knew!” and “Mein Mampf' (my munch) in their protest against neo-Nazis . Locals threw confetti, gave out bananas and hung out brightly coloured banners with humorous slogans such as ‘if only the Führer knew!” and “Mein Mampf' (my munch). The marchers, decked out in black and camouflage clothing, were even greeted with a sign thanking them for their ‘donations’ in the anti-extremist protest encouraging them to move on. Hitler’s deputy Hess was once buried in Wunsiedel – prompting the neo-Nazis to take part in the annual pilgrimage in their tribute to one of the architects of Nazi Germany. Extremists travel from all over Europe for their annual right-wing tribute to Rudolf Hess, Adolf Hitler's deputy . Hess’s remains were exhumed and his grave destroyed in 2011, but far right extremists still flock from all over Europe every year. Despite complaints, locals have been unable to stop the marches. EXIT-Germany is an initiative founded by criminologist and former police detective Bernd Wagner and the former neo-Nazi leader Ingo Hasselbach. The group, which is the brainchild of German magazine Stern, was set up in 2000 to help members of neo-Nazi groups and other right wing elements to leave behind their venomous beliefs.","Right-wing groups gather every year in Germany in tribute to Rudolph Hess .

"A French mayor could face five years in prison after saying today that he would rather 'go to the gallows' than marry two gay men. Jean-Michel Colo, who officiates near the south-western city of Bayonne has refused to wed Jean-Michel Martin and Guy Martineau-Espel. The couple are now suing the mayor for discrimination, claiming that Mr Colo is breaching the same-sex marriage law which came into force across France last month. Protest: There have been numerous protests in France both in favour and against gay marriage, including this stunt at the recent French Open Men's Final between  Rafael Nadal of Spain and compatriot David Ferrer . The dispute is now set to provide a . test case for the new marriage law which has proven divisive in France . and has already seen thousands take to the streets to . protest. Mr Colo, 60, has been mayor of the . small village of Arcangues, in the Pyrenees-Atlantiques department, for . the past three decades. He now risks five years in prison and a . fine of around £64,000 for his refusal to officiate at the wedding of . Mr Martin and Mr Martineau-Espel, who are both in their 50s. Divisive: The new gay marriage law has proven divisive in France where there were protests including this demonstration in March through the streets of Paris. It has also been opposed by both the Catholic Church . 'For me, marriage is for a woman and . man to have children,' said Mr Colo. 'I am not discriminating as a . same-sex couple is sterile. It's a parody of equality, it's a big lie.' Mr Colo added that he would rather 'go . to the gallows' than back down on the vexed issue. He has argued there . is a 'conscience clause' in the new legislation which allows public . officials not to take part in gay marriages. But Isabelle Duguet, the couple's . lawyer, said she had filed a case against Mr Colo for discrimination and . for refusing to carry out his official duties. She said that both of her clients were . 'currently in an intolerable situation, which was particularly unjust, . degrading and discriminatory'. Issue of conscience: The Mayor of Arcangues near the French south western city of Bayonne (pictured0 said the new law allowed him to refuse to marry the gay couple as an issue of conscience . Mr Martineau Espel said he and his . boyfriend had lived in the village since 2003 and 'wanted to celebrate . our wedding in the home we are committed to' and where 'we have the . almost uncontested support of our neighbours.' French interior minister Manuel Valls . has also warned Mr Colo of 'significant punishments' saying that public . servants had a duty to obey the law. The gay marriage bill is viewed as a . centrepiece of the legislative programme of France's Socialist . government. It is more than a month since the act was passed in the . French Assemble by a vote of 331 Assembly members in favour versus 225 . against, despite violent protests in major cities including Paris. Those who opposed the bill include the Roman Catholic Church and Muslim leaders.","Gay couple to sue Mayor of Arcangues for refusing to officiate their wedding .

"Game of chance: Lord Coe said sport in primary schools had become 'too much of a lottery' Lord Coe was plunged into a sexism row last night after saying that most women teachers lack the confidence to take PE lessons in primary schools. The former London 2012 chairman blamed their failings on training colleges that offer only six to ten hours of sports tuition over two years. Although he was simply highlighting research carried out by a sports charity, his comments drew an angry backlash. ‘It is entirely unacceptable to be peddling such sexist nonsense,’ said Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers. ‘I’m sure Jessica Ennis and all those other female Olympians would be outraged by such views. To imply that female primary school teachers don’t have as much ability as men to teach sport isn’t right.’ But Lord Coe, the Government’s Olympic legacy ambassador, insisted it was not a question of ability, but one of training. ‘I was shocked by how little they get,’ he said. ‘Eight out of ten teachers in primary schools are women. And this is not remotely pejorative but I think that something like 80 per cent of them said they just did not feel confident taking physical education. ‘I am guessing that there will be a lot of men who will feel the same way.’ Lord Coe has long emphasised the ‘crucial’ need to provide better PE teaching in primary schools. He raised the issue during a talk he gave in Tilford, Surrey, where he lives. Andrew Carter, head teacher of a nearby primary school who was among the audience, said: ‘Lord Coe said 80 per cent of primary school teachers are women who have had no formal training in PE at all. His implication was that women are less sporty than men, but that’s ridiculous.' Fears over sport: Baroness Campbell of the Youth Sport Trust claimed that many children start secondary school unable to throw a ball, catch, jump or run . ‘It was basically the old-fashioned view that women teachers are a bit fluffy and not keen on sport and, if it came to football, would not know the rules. Lord Coe was not trying to be clever but just trying to make a point that was not really valid. ‘He needs to look at the dance and aerobics activities going on and similar sports activities and not just traditional sports such as football and running. ‘Lord Coe is a highly successful athlete in his own right and the trouble is people who don’t know better believe him and they go away saying, “No one runs sports in primary schools.” ‘So if parents are going to help out with school sports activities, they may wonder what the point is after hearing him express  that view. ‘Lord Coe seems to think that we should turn out Olympians and athletes, but our job is to make children fit and understand their bodies. That way we can lengthen their lives.’ Olympic success: Lord Coe is hoping to inspire the next generation of Olympians by targeting primary teaching . Earlier this year, Baroness Campbell, the head of the Youth Sport Trust which carried out the research, claimed that many children starting secondary school  were unable to throw a ball, catch, jump or run. She said that even pupils inspired to take up a sport after watching the Olympics missed out because teachers were not well trained enough to help them. Shadow Sports Minister Clive Efford said: ‘We do need to improve the quality of teaching sport in primary schools but if Lord Coe is implying that female teachers can’t teach sport because they’re women, then he’s wrong. ‘If he’s saying teaching sport  is poor because it’s predominately taught by women in primary schools then he is taking us  backwards, rather than moving forwards.’ Earlier this month Lord Coe helped launch a new £150 million grant for school sports facilities. The investment comes as the Government unveils plans to train teachers to specialise in PE at  primary school. Lord Coe said: ‘The problem in primary schools is that PE has become too much of a lottery. If you have a head teacher – male or female – who understands sport then probably you’ll have  a better chance of getting good provision. ‘But if their experience of sport was not good then that tends to filter through the school. It occurred to me that the big gap in provision was in primary schools. ‘I saw this as not just a money issue – it was also about changing attitudes, particularly in teacher training. The amount of teacher training that was carried out shocked me. ‘One of the real challenges here is that between the ages of nine and 15 children in the UK become 50 per cent less active. Now that is not sustainable and that’s why we focus on the primary schools. ‘I am not talking just about rugby, cricket, football, track and field etc. You would be limiting children’s opportunities if you just did that.’","Lord Coe said he was 'shocked' by how little training PE teachers get .

"Janet Jackson's husband, Wissam Al Mana, has been accused of firing a female employee from his interior design firm after she reported being raped in Dubai and was then thrown in prison for having extramarital sex. A spokesman for the Qatari billionaire's company, Al Mana Interiors, strongly denied the claims from Marte Deborah Dalelv, saying instead its representatives were 'by her side' throughout the 'ordeal' and that the firm was forced to let her go after she 'declined to have positive and constructive discussions about her employment status.' The Norwegian 24-year-old was sentenced to 16 months in prison this week for having sex outside of marriage after she was raped by a co-worker in March during a business trip to Dubai. Scroll down for video . Boss: Billionaire Wissam Al Mana, managing director of Al Mana Interiors, pictured right with wife Janet Jackson, signed off on a termination letter firing Marte Deborah Dalelv for 'improper behavior' Dalelv reported the sexual assault to police but instead of helping her they arrested her and took her passport away. Her rapist was sentenced to three months less prison time than she got. According to Verdens Gang, three weeks after she reported the crime Dalelv was suspended from her job. Three weeks after that she got a termination letter, signed off by Al Mana himself. 'Further to the suspension letter . notified to you on 20th March 2013, we hereby inform you that you . employment with Al Mana Interiors W.L.L. is terminated for misconduct . and breach of your employment duties, effective immediately,' the letter . reads. Norwegian businesswoman Marte Deborah Dalelv, 24, has been sentenced to 16 months in prison for extramarital sex after she reported being raped . '... your . employment agreement is terminat(ed) due to your unacceptable and . improper behavior during your last business trip in Dubai, which has . resulted in your arrest by the Police Authorities in UAE.' On Saturday, Al Mana Interiors claimed it was forced to let Dalelv go after she 'declined to have positive and constructive discussions about her employment status' and not because of the rape. 'We are sympathetic to Marte Dalelv . during this very difficult situation,' the statement reads. 'Al Mana Interiors has repeatedly . offered Marte support and company representatives were by her side . throughout the initial investigation and police interviews, and spent . days at both the police station and the prosecutor's office to help win . her release. 'Company . representatives have been supportive and in communication with Marte . throughout her ordeal. Only when Ms. Dalelv declined to have positive . and constructive discussions about her employment status, and ceased . communication with her employer, was the company forced to end our . relationship with her. The decision had nothing to do with the rape . allegation, and unfortunately neither Ms. Dalelv nor her attorneys have . chosen to contact the company to discuss her employment status. 'We . continue to be open to helping Ms. Dalelv and extending her resources . during the Dubai legal process. We are hopeful that we can resume a . positive discussion about the assistance she needs during this difficult . time.' Dalelv . reported the sexual assault in March, after which she had to . spend days in a cell before she was allowed to use a telephone. With . the help of family members, the Norwegian consulate was able to . negotiate a release and she has been living under the protection of the . Norwegian Sailor's Church until her sentencing this week. Waiting game: Marte Deborah Dalelv, pictured in Dubai, faces an uncertain future as Norway doesn't have an extradition treaty with Dubai . Dalelv claims she was fired from her position with Al Mana Interiors - which is owned by Janet Jackson's husband, Wissam Al Mana -  during the ordeal . 'I . received the harshest sentence for sex outside marriage, harshest . sentence for drinking alcohol and on top of that I was found guilty of . perjury,' she told Verdens Gang. 'It is a terrible situation she is in,' said Gisle Meling, the priest at the Norwegian Sailor's Church. 'We . are very surprised and had hoped it would go another way, but we live . in a country which has a justice system which draws its conclusions with . the help of Sharia law.' Dalelv was sentenced to one year and four months in jail but as Norway has no extradition treaty with Dubai, her future is uncertain. Janet . Jackson married the Qatari billionaire in a secret ceremony last year. The pair have been together for three years after meeting in 2010. The young Norwegian woman's horror story is not unique. Earlier . this year Australian Alicia Gali, 27, spoke of how she was thrown in a . Dubai jail for eight months after she reported a rape. Dark side: Having been detained in Dubai since the assault in March, Ms  Dalelv has now been found guilty of sex outside marriage, drinking alcohol without a licence and perjury and was jailed for 16 months . Gali was working at hotel chain Starwood when her drink was spiked in the staff bar. She . awoke to find that three colleagues had raped her, but when she went to . a hospital for help, they turned her over to the police and she was . charged with illicit sex outside marriage. Under . UAE law, rapists can only be convicted if either the perpetrator . confesses or if four adult Muslim males witness the crime. Under . the Sharia-influenced laws, sex before marriage is completely forbidden . and an unmarried couple holding hands in public can be jailed. Foreigners jailed in Dubai are deported immediately after completing their sentences.","Norwegian Marte Deborah Dalelv was in Dubai on a business trip when she was raped .

"With their wings spread and chests puffed out, two birds squared up for a brawl. This little owl and great spotted woodpecker were spotted engaging in turf war in a Worcestershire nature reserve. The parental instinct kicked in for both birds as they fought for territory and food and it looked like there was no chance of these two becoming feathered friends.

The tussle was captured by photographer Ian Schofield, 35, who was birdwatching at the Droitwich Spa reserve at the time. He was part of a photography group who had gone to watch the little owls and their chicks when the woodpecker swept in to challenge for the spot. 'All of a sudden, there was a mighty noise,' he said. Mr Schofield quickly turned his camera around to find the birds lashing out at each other with their talons. Mr Schofield went to the nature reserve with his Canon camera to look out for the little owl and its chicks .

"A World Cup in Qatar in Christmas week will be the ruin of English football, they wail. FIFA must go, they rant like dervishes in the desert. Boycott it, rave the demented worshippers of the Premier League as the greatest form of the oldest game on the planet – ever. Such is the gnashing of teeth and tearing of hair here about the date change from summer to winter following the award of 2022 to a Gulf state. Sepp Blatter hands the World Cup to Qatar and Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani five years ago . A computer-generated image of how the main stadium in Doha is set to look for the World Cup in 2022 . Memories are short in the football blame business. It is not much more than a year since our national game – from the FA and the Premier League downwards – was in such profound discussion about introducing a mid-winter break to the season that it almost happened. No-one was worrying about the Christmas and New Year tradition then. Nor that it would bankrupt the English game. Rather, there was a substantial body of opinion that the rush of festive fixtures was so physically damaging to footballers that it was detrimental to the integrity of our professional Leagues. Give us a break, cried the majority of our football managers, coaches and players. Even until this week – when the FIFA task force plumped for the cool of November and December in Qatar seven years from now – Jose Mourinho was virtually a lone voice expressing unbridled enthusiasm for English football’s great Christmas tradition. Only this January Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers sent Raheem Sterling - his best player who also happens to be England’s brightest prospect – on a two-week holiday to the West Indies so that he might come refreshed for the second half of the season after missing some games. Jose Mourinho is one of few public figures to give the English festive season a thumbs up . Raheem Sterling is pictured relaxing in Jamaica after being granted a break by  boss Brendan Rodgers . Of course a winter World Cup will not provide that kind of rest cure for young men apparently jaded by the exertions of playing football a couple of times a week in return for pay packets running into hundreds of thousands of pounds per week. This, not the Premier League, is the greatest tournament of all and it demands that players scale the heights of skill and endeavour. But for the English football authorities to protest that the requisite change to the fixture list will put our game at risk of going skint is wretchedly disingenuous. What this is really all about is that England are miffed about not being given the right to stage either of the next two World Cups - and won’t even be considered for one until the 2030s, at the earliest. And whatever you may think of President Blatter, that is not FIFA’s fault. The English bids from 2006 onwards have been absolute disasters. In those campaigns, the FA showed about as much grasp of what the football world expects of its World Cup Finals hosts as Tony Blair and George Bush of the catastrophic consequences of their over-throwing of Middle East dictators. Prince William, David Cameron and David Beckham appear in jovial mood ahead of that fateful day in Zurich . Beckham, Lord Sebastian Coe and Andy Anson of the bid committe share uneasy looks in Switzerland . Nor were the Premier League of much help at all. The bids were so bloated with pomposity, arrogance and self-satisfaction – ‘we’ re the greatest, give it to us’ - as to be laughable abroad. Consciously or not, the English reaction to Qatar amounts to an enraged attempt to bury the memory of those pitiful efforts by inflaming public opinion here against FIFA in general and Sepp Blatter in particular. This has become simply the default response here to almost everything football. By and large, however, it may surprise much of our own population that the anti-FIFA criticism is nothing like as vociferous elsewhere. Even UEFA, with whom the FA and Premier League like to regard themselves allied against the world governing body, have joined the other five Continental federations in approving the move to mid-winter. Even Luis Figo, one of the puppet challengers to Blatter in the forthcoming presidential election, has given his backing. Yet in their hysteria to scream foul, England’s football bosses and many of the game’s celebrities are blind to how Christmas in Qatar could actually help us win the World Cup for the first time in half a century. Luis Figo recently launched a campaign to oust Blatter as FIFA president . Phil Neville has taken a great deal of flak as a novice TV pundit but as he shrewdly points out: ‘England normally go into a World Cup at the end of a long season with our players dead on their feet. This might be good for us.’ Not that the Premier League are likely to pay much attention to that. So perhaps their memory needs jogging that most of the European nations take a midweek break during the festive season and that Germany (one month off), France (three weeks), Spain and Italy (two weeks) have all won the World Cup since Sir Alf, Bobby and the rest of the sunshine boys of ’66. Nor do any of their Leagues appear to be going broke. Most of the rest of global football’s acceptance of Qatar ’22 does no good at all to England’s self-perceived fall-back position – that of being asked to step in as the alternative venue in the now highly improbable event of Qatar being stripped of the World Cup. The FA’s only hope left appears to be Russia declaring war on Western Europe before the World Cup goes there in 2018. That’s how desperate they are. Dan Topolski – not only a genius rowing coach but a fine man – sadly died last weekend at the ridiculously premature age these days of 69. A world champion oarsman in his own right – despite his slight build – Topolski coached Oxford to 10 successive Boat Race victories from 1976 to 1985. Two years later, five star US rowers at the University led a revolt against Topolski and his unorthodox methods: ‘He never trains, he only races.’ Dan Topolski, former rower, Oxford rowing coach, author and BBC commentator passed away aged 69 . What they failed to appreciate was that he was a profound psychologist and supreme analyst who knew how to win. He sacked the Americans and, against all odds and predictions, sent out his weakened, makeshift crew to beat Cambridge from Putney to Mortlake yet again. The Yanks went home, dragging their oars behind them. Topolski authored a renowned book about the mutiny True Blue which was made into a major movie. He took to journalism, not only as writer but, since 1990, as the most sage and entertaining voice of BBC rowing commentary. Topolski (left) belied fears about his slim stature and went on to become an inspirational coach . Whenever it fell to me to report rowing – be it on the Thames tideway or the greatest race of all when, at the Athens Olympics, Steven Redgrave won his record fourth gold medal as the UK’s coxless four beat Canada by a fraction of a second – it was Topolski who kindly and patiently marked my card. Then, when the work was done, we went for a drink. Shrewd, amusing, generous and engaging company, gentleman Dan will be hugely missed by all who knew him. A very private funeral will be followed, during this summer’s Henley Regatta, by a memorial service out there beside the great river he loved.","The World Cup final in 2022 will take place on December 23 .

"Nafees Hamid, an award-winning neurosurgeon, has been jailed for 16 years for nine charges of sexual assault on six patients at Birmingham hospitals . An award-winning neurosurgeon indecently assaulted six of his female patients while working at two hospitals and has been jailed for 16 years for the attacks. Nafees Hamid, a spinal surgery specialist, abused his trusted status to commit the assaults on women - some of whom were vulnerable - while working at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth and Priory hospitals. The 51-year-old consultant was described during his two month trial at Birmingham Crown Court as 'a good surgeon but not a good man.' Jurors heard he performed intimate and prolonged examinations on women, often without gloves, which were found to be medically unjustifiable. They had come to him for back and neck problems. Hamid was found guilty of nine sexual assaults against six women, which took place between 2012 and 2013. At a hearing at Birmingham Crown Court Judge Patrick Thomas QC told the neurosurgeon he was the most intelligent man he had ever seen in the dock of a criminal court but that he had been 'brought low' by lust. He said Hamid exercised his lust 'arrogantly' over his patients, abusing them in what he described as 'the most extreme breach of trust.' Among Hamid's victims was a woman in her mid-20s whose complaint led to the neurosurgeon's arrest and him being charged in November last year. This then triggered a sequence of events that led to other victims coming forward to report assaults at the hands of Hamid. When he was arrested Hamid claimed his intimate examinations were medically justified but a subsequent investigation found this was not the case. The patient, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told jurors she felt 'frozen to the spot' as she was subjected to an assault at the private Priory Hospital in Birmingham last year. She has since been praised for her bravery in exposing the abuse of trust by Hamid. The other charges relate to four women who attended hospital for a variety of complaints between January and September 2012. The spinal injury specialist used his trusted status to attack the women, performing medically unjustifiable examinations on them. Jurors heard that the victims, some of whom were described as vulnerable, were referred to Hamid for neurosurgical assessment over a two-year period. Hamid encouraged some of his patients to remove their clothing and on occasions, removed their clothes himself without a chaperone being present. He would then perform intimate examinations without wearing gloves, and made inappropriate sexual remarks. Hamid abused patients during intimate medical examinations at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham . The first victim to come forward said she was 'frozen to the spot' when Hamid abused her at The Priory . Expert medical opinion was sought on the examination techniques he was using and he was found to be ignoring General Medical Council guidelines. Judge Patrick Thomas QC jailed Hamid for 16 years for the nine sexual assaults. He said: 'This is the most extreme breach of trust. 'These ladies went to see you because they had significant problems and they thought - with your skills, abilities and experience - you were the person who could help them with the medical problems. 'Instead you grossly abused them.' Hamid claimed throughout his trial at Birmingham Crown Court that his victims were either lying or mistaken . When he was arrested Hamid tried to use his medical knowledge of research to claim his examinations were justified but this was later disproved. Judge Thomas added: 'You are without question in my experience the most intelligent man I have ever seen in the dock of a criminal court. 'You, through hard work and devotion to your course of studies, rose high within your profession to become an enormously respected consultant neurosurgeon at one of the great hospitals in our region. West Midlands Police say they cannot rule out the chance that Hamid may have abused more women who had been in his care but who had not yet come forward. Detective Inspector Ian Ingram said: 'He's been a neurosurgeon for a period of time, and these are the victims that have come forward to us at the moment. 'It may be that we get further victims come forward. 'It's important that if they do, we will help them. 'And it might show that it's been occurring over a longer period.' Mr Ingram said Hamid relied on his medical knowledge to claim what he did was justified and that his victims were wrong but this was later found to be incorrect. He added: 'To be in a position of having those skills and using that ability to sexually assault patients is very sad.' 'You were brought low by a simple failing - lust. 'And you exercised your lust as a result of arrogance. You liked doing what you did, touching sexually your female patients, and you took the opportunity to do it because you could.' Hamid, of Moseley, Birmingham, trained in Pakistan and moved to Britain in 2000. He got a job at the Priory Hospital where he worked between 2003 and 2013 as a consultant specialising in disorders affecting the skull, spine and nervous system. Hamid was  acquitted of five charges of sexual assaults which related to four other patients. Speaking after the case Crown Advocate Aliya Rashid, who acted as junior prosecution counsel, said: 'Nafees Hamid, whilst in a position of high trust, carried out intrusive and inappropriate examinations on vulnerable women while masking his true purpose, which was personal sexual gratification. 'These examinations left women shocked, confused, embarrassed and deeply upset. 'Many were fearful about reporting one of the most highly esteemed consultant neurosurgeons to the authorities. 'It is due to their courage and the cogent evidence they gave that Hamid has been found guilty today of his crimes.' Lisa Windridge, senior Crown Prosecutor from the West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service's Public Protection Unit, said: 'This case is an example of a gross breach of trust at the highest level and I would like to thank all those victims who came forward and assisted the whole of the prosecution team in exposing this man.' The brave woman whose courage led to Hamid's conviction . The sex attacks carried out by Nafees Hamid as he abused his position as a trusted surgeon could have gone undetected were it not for the courage of one of his patients. The woman, who is in her 20s, decided to go to him because she was suffering chronic pain and health issues stemming from a back complaint following an accident. She chose Hamid because of his reputation, but this ended in a sexual assault at the private Priory Hospital in Birmingham. The woman told jurors she felt 'frozen to the spot' on the examination table as the 51-year-old carried out a lengthy assault lasting some 20 minutes. She said: 'He was doing this rubbing thing on my legs and just kept going higher and higher. 'He then started asking about my sex life ... the whole thing was mortifying.' She was then told by Hamid that she was a 'sweet girl' before he led her out of her office. The woman burst into tears as she walked through the car park and phoned a relative to tell her 'I think I've just been sexually assaulted'. She then contacted police which led to Hamid's arrest and the conclusion that his intimate examination was not medically justified and was sexual assault. After this police began to search for other victims. Hamid was charged and this triggered a letter from his employer, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, which was sent to more than 700 patients. Patients were asked if they had any concerns they wished to report, but the letter did not name him. For the woman who triggered the police investigation into Hamid's offending, her feelings are mixed. She said: 'I'll now always insist on seeing a female doctor, and if there's not one available I'll wait and put up with the pain until one is free. That's how he's left me feeling. 'I've seen countless doctors in the past and never felt any reservations about them, but what he did has changed all that and wrecked my confidence.' She said she was pleased she contacted police and was proud this led to the investigation. She added: 'It's reassuring to think I might have saved other women from going through the same ordeal as me.' Of the surgeon, who throughout his trial alleged his accusers were either lying or mistaken, she said: 'I don't hate him, I pity him. 'He's abused his position of trust and sacrificed his career, his livelihood and his reputation and for what? A few moments of weird gratification. 'The knowledge he'll be sent to prison and punished for what he's done will help me move on.' Detective Inspector Ian Ingram, of West Midlands Police, has praised the woman for coming forward, and for the courage of other victims who also gave evidence. He said there could be more victims as Hamid had power over his patients because he was in a position of trust as their neurosurgeon. Mr Ingram said: 'Often they did tell family members about what took place and they were clearly upset by what took place, but they never came forward to police to explain what happened. 'And I think that's the power that this doctor had over them. He was in that position of trust. They doubted whether they would be believed, doubted whether it was medically justified what he had done. 'They had questions, and that's why it has taken so long for them to come forward.'","Nafees Hamid was an award winning neurosurgeon working in Birmingham .

"It is not the obscene prospect of the £500,000-a-week player which most blatantly exposes the moral bankruptcy of big-time football in this country. It is the reluctance of all but one of the Premier League clubs to pay all the rest of their staff a living wage. Even as he was announcing the sale of three seasons of British television rights for Premier League matches for more than £5billion, chief executive Richard Scudamore brazenly defended the right of his clubs to pay lesser workers £6.50 an hour. Radamel Falcao is on an eye-watering £285,000 a week during his loan spell at Manchester United . With the new TV deal, players at the level of Sergio Aguero could be on £500,000 a week by 2020 . No he is ‘not uncomfortable’ with the clubs he is enriching beyond Croesus keeping some employees on that bare legal minimum rather than the UK living wage of £7.85 an hour, rising to £9.15 in London. Nor, by inference, does Scudamore regard it as a ‘disgrace’ that so many cleaners of dressing rooms, sweepers of terraces and pourers of tea earn £284,772.50 less for a 35-hour week than the £285,000 which is the reported salary of Radamel Falcao for making intermittent appearances with Manchester United. Once this new TV deal is boosted above £8bn by the placement of overseas broadcasting rights, Senor Falcao’s wage packet is expected to be eclipsed by the first half-a-million-pounds-a-week ball-kickers. Even though that may appear grotesque in relation to the ordinary ability and average achievements of the Premier League’s over-rated celebrities, good luck to them. Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore at the announcement of the bumper package this week . But not at the impoverishing expense of those who clear up after them. Chelsea take a great deal of flak these days – not least their manager Jose Mourinho – but in this issue they are setting an example which should embarrass their 19 Premier League rivals. Chelsea alone have contracted to meet, at least, the basic demand of the Living Wage Foundation. While Manchester City have agreed to pay the living wage to staff they employ directly, though not contract workers, others like Arsenal, who charge the most in the land for season tickets, simply ignore the outrage. Nor can Scudamore guarantee that the rise in television revenues – now up to an astonishing £10m per match – will bring about the reduction in admission prices for which supporters are campaigning. ‘Not all the clubs make a profit,’ he bleats. Well, if they don’t they have only themselves to blame for paying their players – and worse still their agents – way too much. And when Scudamore protests that ‘the fans want the best talent to come and play in the Premier League’ he conveniently forgets that Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Neymar and others of the world’s creme-de-la-creme prefer to ply their trade abroad. Actually, that makes his negotiation of the new TV deal all the more remarkable, especially in the eyes of ‘my 20 employers.’ Hence his own salary and bonus package amounts to around £2m a year. And now they are considering promoting to executive chairman this man who, less than a year ago, was facing widespread demands that he be sacked for ‘sexually inappropriate’ texting. Quite how the toilet cleaners at the Emirates feel about that they have yet to tell us but Scudamore says: ‘Like in the film and pop industry the absolute talent get paid a disproportionately high amount.’ Of course he is right when he says: ‘We’re in the entertainment business.’ Cristiano Ronaldo, the world's best player, left the Premier League for Real Madrid six years ago . The Premier League is not so much a sporting competition as a circus with, yes, we the media as one of its three rings generating much of the manically excessive hype. Hence this mega-bucks deal which will feed its own greed and never mind that it will further weaken our feeble England team by financing the import of yet more foreign footballers. But what about this industry’s more lowly workers? Says Scudamore: ‘There is a thing called the living wage. Then there is a minimum wage which the politicians have the power to raise, which is not for us to do.’ One of those politicians, shadow London minister Sadiq Khan, calls his remarks ‘disgraceful.’ He exhorts the Premier League clubs to lift their most lowly-paid staff onto the living wage ‘so they can put food on the table and pay the rent.’ Food for thought, also? Only the morally bankrupt would think not. Because whether it be Mr Scudamore or the majority of his 20 paymasters, somebody should be feeling ashamed about that. Jose Mourinho is in his element in the spotlight. Paul Lambert was like a rabbit caught in the headlights. Two more examples of why, in the lead article to this column, I refer to the Premier League as a circus. Mourinho, as one of the ringmasters, not only survives but prospers at Chelsea because he meets controversy – like the Branislav Ivanovic non-biting incident at Wednesday’s evening performance – with outraged indignation. Jose Mourinho plays his role to perfection - performing for the gallery and preparing to be champion . Paul Lambert is out of a job after his reign as Aston Villa manager was brought to an end on Wednesday night . Lambert suffers pain, torment and humiliation at Aston Villa, which is invariably the miserable lot of circus animals. One plays to a captivated gallery and prepares to be anointed, once again, as a champion. The other shrivels in the glare and is hounded out. It is the way of the beast . Some accuse Louis van Gaal of long-ball tactics. Others criticise Manchester United’s manager for playing Wayne Rooney too deep, in midfield. If both are true, no wonder his expensive ensemble are struggling, . By-passing your best player – which is the Boy Wayne, not the Angel di Maria – is not a very good idea. Hold on a minute, is that Wayne Rooney playing as a defensive midfielder for Manchester United? United boss Louis van Gaal has been under the spotlight for using Rooney in a deeper role than he's used to .","Only Chelsea contracted to meet demand of the Living Wage Foundation .

"When 66-year-old actress Alison Steadman recently revealed she has no time for expensive face creams and moisturises with Nivea Crème to keep her skin looking youthful, I rejoiced. I have been using budget face creams for 33 years, ever since my mother bought me my first pot of Ponds Dry Skin cream, aged 13, and told me it was all I'd need for a great complexion. She'd also started using it when she was a teenager and, while she's never set foot in a beauty salon, her skin still looks incredible at 71. Put to the test: Claire Cisotti applied the different creams to each side of her face for a month to see which was better . Though we were both distraught when our favourite moisturiser was discontinued ten years ago, we didn't turn to anything expensive. Instead, we stuck with Ponds and started using their Triple Action cream instead - at the price of just £4.49 a pot. Cheap moisturiser devotees include Kate Winslet, 37, and the perennially youthful Joan Collins, 80 - who have both admitted using Nivea Crème. But can a potion that costs just over £1 really compete with such a luxury brand? I decided to put them both to the test. For 30 days I would moisturise the left side of my face with Nivea Crème - £1.15 for 30ml. On the other side I would use Crème de la Mer - £105 for 30ml. While Nivea Crème, which comes in distinctive blue pots, was first launched in Germany in 1911 and contains everyday ingredients such as glycerin, Crème de la Mer has a more exciting heritage and formula. It was invented half a century ago by aerospace physicist Dr Max Huber to heal his skin after a routine lab experiment exploded in his face, leaving him with chemical burns. Which fights wrinkles better? The budget buy Nivea or expensive Creme de la Mer? Its secret weapon is a 'miracle broth', made from a blend of fermented seaweed, vitamins and minerals that’s been treated with sound waves. According to the company website: 'Crème de la Mer has the power to transform the look of skin. In a short time, skin appears firmer, lines, wrinkles and pores appear less visible, skin looks virtually ageless.' It's quite a claim. Before I started, I had my skin tested by Nicolas Miedzianowski-Sinclair, of The Cosmetic Imaging Studio - which provides 3D images for people considering cosmetic procedures, using a Visia machine to scan my face. He would then re-test at the end of my experiment. Developed by Nasa to monitor the effects of radiation and zero gravity on astronauts' skin, the Visia uses different types of light exposure to measure wrinkles, sun damage, redness and pore size. According to Nicolas, while my wrinkles and fine lines are better than average for my age - I turn 47 soon - my skin is quite dehydrated. He also highlights the mild rosacea I inherited from my mum which often leaves my complexion, especially my cheeks, looking red. Bargain  buyers: Actresses Alison Steadman, left , and Kate Winslet are said to use Nivea cream . So how would Nivea Crème and Crème de la Mer perform against each other? Which would be crowned the crème de la crème of face creams? Here's the diary of my month... On the first morning, I gently cleanse my face with my usual Garnier Gentle Cleansing Milk (£3.05), then apply the Crème de la Mer on the right side. You are provided with a scoop to ensure you use the correct amount - a blob the size of a large pea - that you first have to warm between your fingers before it goes translucent and is ready to be applied. According to the makers, this activates the ingredients. The white cream, which doesn’t have a scent, is then pressed in, not rubbed, so it doesn't drag the skin. But it's so thick that I have to pat for ages before it is absorbed. I have sensitive skin, which goes red and itchy if I apply harsh creams, but there's no reaction to the Crème de la Mer. Then, on the other side, I use the same amount of Nivea Crème, which is white and even more thick-textured, and pat that into the left side. Scientific research: Claire had her skin tested before and after using the creams by Nicolas Miedzianowski-Sinclair, of The Cosmetic Imaging Studio . The Nivea just seems to vanish into my face. I was worried it might be too harsh, but again there's no adverse reaction. I quickly get into my new beauty routine. At this stage, I can't see any difference between the two sides, but after a couple of days I see my beauty therapist, Nicola. She thinks that while both halves of my face feel very smooth, the left side of my face is glowing in particular - an early lead for Nivea. Meanwhile, I think my face is slightly less red on the right side. Perhaps Crème de la Mer does have a magic calming effect. A cluster of painful pimples has developed on the right side of my nose. As that's the Crème de la Mer side, my husband jokes that they are the most expensive spots I'll ever have. I wonder if the rich cream is blocking my pores, so avoid applying any cream there for a day or two. It also becomes clear that using Crème de la Mer is incredibly time consuming. Normally I can shower, moisturise all over and get dressed in 15 minutes. But measuring and warming the cream, then gently patting it into my skin, adds ten minutes to my morning routine. Faded: The lines around Claire's eyes are reduced after using the Nivea cream, right . By the middle of the week, the spots have gone and both sides of my face are feeling smooth and looking very healthy. It must help that we are on holiday in Corsica. As advised by Nicolas Miedzianowski-Sinclair, I'm applying factor 50 to my face and chest, so am keeping tanning to a minimum. I can't see much difference between either side of my face, but when you consider one cream costs £100 more, it's incredible how well the Nivea is performing. I've reached the halfway point. I examine my face closely with a mirror, and think the lines on the left side are a little less visible around my eyes and my skin seems plumper, too. Sadly, at the end of the week we have to return home. I wonder how the creams will perform once I'm back to spending ten hours a day in an air-conditioned office. Back at work, I ask everyone to look at my face to see if there is any difference, and if so which half looks best - everyone picks the left side. Not once during the experiment has anyone picked the Crème de la Mer side. By now both creams are performing well, as people keep complimenting me on my appearance. My sister visits and keeps staring at my face. She says I'm looking younger and asks if I’ve had Botox. I reassure her I haven't - and still wouldn't. With only a few days left before my experiment ends, I realise how strange it's going to be using just one cream on my whole face. I have become so used to patting one cream on one side and another cream on the other. But which one is going to be the winner? Result: The Nivea cream performed better according to the scans . I return to Nicolas for the final results and he's unequivocal. According to the dermatologist's scans, Nivea has performed best. He says the left-hand side of my face - where I used Nivea - has retained better hydration than its rival. Not only this, but my redness has reduced and some of the fine lines around my eyes have disappeared. On the Nivea side, he thinks I have the skin of someone five years younger than I am. While I felt that both creams made my skin look great, if you can get better results for a fraction of the price of Crème de la Mer and a lot less hassle in the morning, the winner is obvious. So when a friend rings me from Lidl to tell me Nivea Crème is on special offer - a 200ml pot is just £1.99 - I ask her to buy me two.","Alison Steadman, 66, recently said she doesn't use expensive face creams .

"Just three years ago, this was a run down house worth £575,000. But with a lot of love and devotion, its new owners transformed it into an ultra luxurious property. And now it has gone on the market for a cool £1.395million. This means that in three years it will have earned its owners £800,000 – about £660 a day. Scroll down for video . Unassuming: This house in south west has more than doubled in value over three years after a major revamp . Understated: The whole house is painted in ivory and many features are hidden, including a full rowing machine . The price of the house in Southfields, South-West London - on sale with Kinleigh Folkard & Hayward estate agents - is the latest example of London’s soaring property market. Yesterday, the Office for National Statistics said that house prices in the capital are rising by nearly 19 per cent a year, the second fastest rate since its records began. The average home in the capital now . costs £485,000, which means it will cross the landmark of £500,000 . within weeks if house prices continue to rocket. Laura and Andrew Blake bought the house in January 2011 from an elderly woman. Mr Blake, 42, who works for the project management company Lifestyle Homes, and his wife, a former primary school teacher, took it on as a renovation project. Hot property: The kitchen includes an instant boiling water tap so the couple never have to switch on a kettle . They installed a designer Jacuzzi, a rowing machine hidden under a trap door in the kitchen and a boiling water tap so they never have to switch on a kettle. They also have a double-sized ‘rain shower’ and a laundry chute leading away from each bedroom directly to the laundry room. In the garden they created a golf putting green and planted lemon trees lit by sensor lights to give them lemons all year round. Mrs Blake said: ‘We loved doing the project . and we’ve really enjoyed the space. I must admit we are pleased with the price.’ They now plan to move to another rundown house in the area and work their renovating magic on it. Green shoots of recovery: There is even a small area for putting practice for the two golf enthusiasts . Figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders show there is more mortgage debt in south-west London than there is in the whole of Wales. Homeowners in the area now owe a total of £29.4billion, compared to £28.6billion in Wales. Yesterday the Bank of England said it would ‘not hesitate’ to take urgent action, if needed, to cool the housing market. The governor Mark Carney said he was ‘fully aware’ that rock-bottom interest rates might encourage families into ‘excessive risk taking’, such as taking out a super-size mortgage which they can only afford when rates are low.","Home in Southfields, London, was run-down and worth £575,000 in 2011 .

"Ben Seewald, the staunch Christian boyfriend of 19 Kids and Counting star Jessa Duggar, 21, has been forced to delete an anti-Catholic rant he posted to his Facebook page last week, after it caused a social media storm, reports RadarOnline. The 19-year-old, from Hot Springs, Arkansas, vented his 'problem' with the Catholic faith, slamming the religion for suggesting that Jesus' mother Mary was a 'sinless being,' and quoting scripture to support his views. 'Where [Catholics] depart from Scripture, I will in no way support, but will call them out because I love them and desire that they be turned from their deadly errors,' the frothy diatribe read. Scroll down for video . Wedding bells: The two are set to tie the knot, but have yet to kiss . 'I have nothing against individuals who are Catholic,' the post read. 'I know a lot of Catholics who are great people. What I DO have a problem with is the teaching that man can merit God’s favor through his own works or the works of other fallen men.' It continued: 'I DO have a problem with the teaching that man can come to God through Mary or any other person besides Jesus . . . I DO have a problem with the deification of Mary as a sinless being. 'Mary herself admitted her need for a Savior. If she had no sin, she would need no Savior.' Readers were quick to respond to Ben's post - not the first aggressive religion rant he has shared to the social media site. 'Ben is the worst. He is just the worst,' one user commented. 'This kind of ‘Christian love’ is one of the most sickening sentiments on the planet. 'It’s demeaning, it’s condescending, it’s self-aggrandizing and it turns my stomach.' Next level: The new status of their relationship permits the Springdale, Arkansas couple to finally hold hands . Many users pointed out the various errors in his Bible references, with one writing: 'You post your almighty preachings as if you know the real truth. 'Where [Catholics] depart from Scripture, . I will in no way support, but will call them out because I love them . and desire that they be turned from their deadly errors' 'But, then people point out your numerous mistakes, you take your post down or just erase all the negative things. Grow up boy and face the truth.' Not long afterwards, Mr Seewald did indeed erase the post. He has since shared a post about 'Abortion. America's Silent Killer,' - another one of his preferred subjects to proselytize. He followed this up with a somewhat less inflammatory passage of advice, which reads: 'As followers of Jesus, we know the compassion he has shown us - show that to others. May God shine through us to brighten another's world.' Lost in prayer: The God-loving couple, Ben (left) and Jessa (right) met at church and started dating shortly after . Family portrait: Jim Bob Duggar (center right) once said of his 19-strong brood, 'People think we are overpopulating the world [but] we are following our convictions' According to the Duggar family's views on dating, Jessa and Ben are just 'courting' for now, which means they refrain from kissing or holding hands and always have a chaperone on dates. The Duggars, from Tontitown, Arkansas, see courting as a couple deciding whether marriage is appropriate while in a group setting with both of their families. Only once they have committed to their engagement are they permitted to hold hands for the first time, but they will have to wait until their wedding day before sharing their first kiss. The Duggar family are considered representative of the Quiverfull movement which teaches that 'children are God’s blessing and that husbands and wives should happily welcome every child they are given.'

"The residents of a New Zealand retirement village have proven that despite any aching joints and stiff hips their dancing shoes are as good as new by creating their own version of Pharrell Williams' hit song Happy. The 60 residents and staff from the Diana Isaac Retirement Village in Christchurch, have received over a million views of their video clip, 80 Odd Years Of Happy, which mimics the moves and scenes created by Pharrell himself.

"One hundred million worlds in our galaxy are able to host alien life, according to a ‘conservative’ prediction by Nasa. And the space agency claims that we will be able to find that life within the next 20 years, with a high chance it will be outside our solar system. During a public talk yesterday in Washington, the space agency outlined a roadmap to search for life in the universe using a number of current and future telescopes. 'I would venture to say that most of my colleagues here today say it is improbable that in the limitless vastness of the universe we humans stand alone,' said former astronaut and Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden (pictured) 'Do we believe there is life beyond Earth?' said former astronaut and Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden. 'I would venture to say that most of my colleagues here today say it is improbable that in the limitless vastness of the universe we humans stand alone.' Mars and a number of moons in our solar system have been the focus of the search for alien life for decades. This . Nasa graphic shows how the number of confirmed planets has dramatically . increased since the launch of Kepler in 2009 and its subsequent studies . of distant stars . The James Webb Space Telescope (artist's concept above) will be one of the primary instruments scientists use to continue the search for planets outside our solar system . Since its launch in 2009, Kepler has dramatically changed what scientists know about exoplanets, . It has found most of the more than 5,000 potential exoplanets, of which more than 1700 have been confirmed. The Kepler observations have led to estimates of billions of planets in our galaxy, and shown that most planets within one astronomical unit are less than three times the diameter of Earth. Kepler also found the first Earth-size planet to orbit in the 'habitable zone' of a star, the region where liquid water can pool on the surface. 'What we didn't know five years ago is that perhaps 10 to 20 per cent of stars around us have Earth-size planets in the habitable zone,' said Matt Mountain, director and Webb telescope scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. 'It's within our grasp to pull off a discovery that will change the world forever.’ For instance, astronomer Kevin Hand recently suggested alien life could exist on Jupiter's moon Europa. But the Nasa scientists on the panel spoke exclusively about looking for signs of life on planets around other stars outside our solar system. 'Sometime in the near future, people will be able to point to a star and say, ""that star has a planet like Earth"",' said Sara Seager, professor of planetary science and physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts. 'Astronomers think it is very likely that every single star in our Milky Way galaxy has at least one planet.' Nasa first began studying planetary systems around other stars with ground-based observatories. It then moved to space-based assets like the Hubble Space Telescope, the Spitzer Space Telescope, and the Kepler Space Telescope. These telescopes can determine if the planets are the right distance away from the star to have liquid water, the key ingredient to life as we know it. Nasa is now hoping to launch of the Transiting Exoplanet Surveying Satellite (Tess) in 2017, the James Webb Space Telescope in 2018, and potentially the proposed Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope - Astrophysics Focused Telescope Assets early in the next decade. The Kepler space telescope finds planets using the transit method, . which measures the dip in light from stars when a planet passes in . front, from which the world's size and orbit can be deduced . Kepler . has found many siginificant planet including Kepler 296-f (pictured), a . so-called 'super Earth' twice the size of our planet but in the . habitable zone of its star, meaning it could have liquid water on its . surface . 'This technology we are using to explore exoplanets is real,' said John Grunsfeld, astronaut and associate administrator for Nasa’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington. 'The James Webb Space Telescope and the next advances are happening now. These are not dreams - this is what we do at Nasa.' During a question-and-answer session, someone using social media, asked: 'If scientists do find life on another planet, will the U.S. government let people know?' The discovery of Kepler-186f, artist's rendering pictured, was announced last week. It is the first Earth-sized planet found in the habitable zone of a star, and could signal that there are Earth 2.0s waiting to be found in Kepler's data . Ellen Stofan, chief scientist at Nasa said, 'Of course we would!' 'That would be so amazingly exciting. We would try to get it out to the public as fast as we can. We want everyone to share in the excitement of discovery.' Finding smaller planets that are the Earth’s ‘twin’ is difficult because they produce fainter signals. Technology to detect and image these Earth-like planets is being developed now for use with the future space telescopes. The ability to detect alien life may still be years or more away, but the quest is underway. 'Just imagine the moment, when we find potential signatures of life,’ Professor Mountain said. ‘Imagine the moment when the world wakes up and the human race realises that its long loneliness in time and space may be over - the possibility we're no longer alone in the universe.’","Nasa predicts that 100 million worlds in our galaxy can host alien life .
During a talk yesterday in Washington, the space agency outlined a roadmap to search for alien life using current and future telescopes .

This will be followed by the James Webb Space Telescope in 2018 .

"Suicide: Troll victim Hannah Smith, 14, killed herself after being bullied on website Ask.fm . The father of a teenage girl who killed herself after months of bullying online has said changes to social networking site Ask.fm do not go far enough. David Smith wants the controversial website to ban all anonymous posts to stop online bullies hiding their true identities. He also said he has not received an apology after he accused Ask.fm of trying to ‘discredit’ his daughter by saying most of the abuse she received she sent to herself. Fourteen-year-old Hannah Smith was found hanged in her bedroom earlier this month after suffering months of abuse on the controversial ‘question and answer’ site. The Latvian based website has been linked to the deaths of four other teenagers including Daniel Perry, 17, from Dunfermline in July and Josh Unsworth, 15, from Lancashire in April. Specsavers, Vodafone, Laura Ashley, EDF Energy and charity Save the Children all pulled adverts from Ask.fm amid the controversy surrounding Hannah’s death. Now the site has announced a number of new measures designed to make it safer to for young people to use the site after an independent review. Among the changes are the introduction of a higher-profile button for reporting bullying and a pledge to respond within 24 hours. It will also set up a separate website for parents to find out more about Ask.fm and hire more site moderators. The review - which will be implemented by next spring - was due to be announced last Friday but was postponed to allow Hannah’s funeral to take place. Campaign: Hannah Smith's father David Smith, pictured with Hannah's sister Jo, wants Ask.fm to ban all anonymous posts . Mr Smith, 45, yesterday said the auditors had ‘taken a good, long look’ at the website and the measures would make the site safer. But he said: ‘It’s a shame that someone has to go through what I and my family have gone through to get a company to change its ways.’ And he added: ‘I think they’ve gone far enough to make the website safe for teenagers to use but I also think they can do a bit more. ‘Get rid of the anonymous bit completely, because if you are anonymous, you can bully.’ Mr Smith said that he emailed the company immediately after his daughter’s death on August 2, but claimed it blocked his emails. He also criticised what he believes were attempts to ‘discredit’ his daughter after reports emerged that she posted some of the abusive questions aimed at her on the site. Distress: Hannah posted this photograph the day before she hanged herself after being bullied for months . Social network: The Latvian-based website has been linked to the deaths of four other British teenagers . The lorry driver said: ‘That stung me for a day or two, but then I thought I would carry on trying to push for a change. ‘Ask.fm have not apologised, but they have done something to make teenagers safe. ‘I didn’t want the website closed down, I wanted it made safe for people to use and now it will, hopefully.’ Mr Smith has vowed to ‘keep fighting’ for a change in the law compelling websites like Ask.fm to hand over the details of any online abusers to police. Ask.fm has said it will make it easier for users to opt out of receiving anonymous messages and it will limit the number of features unregistered users can access. But the family of apprentice mechanic Daniel Perry also warned more needed to be done to guarantee safety on the site. Daniel jumped from the Forth Road Bridge in Scotland after being targeted by trolls on Ask.fm and receiving threatening messages via Skype. Speaking on behalf of his family his uncle Ron Reilly, 47, said: ‘The best thing I think is for the site to be closed down for good. Another victim: Daniel Perry, 17, killed himself after being targeted in a blackmail plot and told to commit suicide by anoymous users of ask.fm. ‘But if it did it would just start again under a new name so at least this way it can be monitored. ‘At least now we’re moving in the right direction, there is plenty more than can and needs to be done. ‘I think it’s all you can do, you’ve got to start somewhere.’ The father of Josh Unsworth, who was found hanged after suffering months of abuse from trolls on the site, said the changes were ‘too little, too late’. Gary Unsworth, 47, from Goosnargh, Lancashire said: ‘It’s a positive step. ‘But it’s taken them a long time to get to this point and I’m not going to say “well done” because it’s too little, too late. ‘The changes are fair and reasonable but the proof will be in the pudding.’ Mr Unsworth, a director of a vehicle hire company, also said he was concerned users would still have the option to remain anonymous. He said: ‘It all comes down to money really ‘Ask.fm have made these changes because they’ve been put under pressure by advertisers and the press. Condolences: Prime Minister David Cameron wrote to David Smith to say the Government takes cyberbullying very seriously . ‘It’s a business at the end of the day and they had to do something or risk going into the red.’ Ask.fm said it would create a ‘bullying/harassment’ category for reported comments alongside ‘spam or scam’, ‘hate speech’ ‘violence’ and ‘pornographic content’. John Carr, secretary of the UK’s Children’s Charities Coalition on Internet Safety, who is an adviser to the government on child safety gave a cautious welcome to the changes. He said: ‘The number of moderators they employ will be crucial as well as how fast they can be trained. ‘But the measures they’ve announced definitely show they got the message and are moving in the right direction.’ Ask.fm has grown increasingly popular among young people with 1.4m internet users from the UK visiting the site in July. The site makes around £5m a year from advertising aimed at its 60m users. Its Russian co-founders Ilja and Mark Terebin said: ‘The number of users on Ask.fm has increased dramatically since our launch in 2010. ‘As the site grows we recognise that it must also mature and adapt, not only to stay relevant and attractive to our users but to promote a safe and respectful environment. ‘It is our hope that, as part of our continuing commitment to improve our site and its safety features, these changes will help achieve this.’ Anyone feeling emotionally distressed or suicidal can call Samaritans for help on 08457 90 90 90 .","Hannah Smith's father says Ask.fm's safety changes do not go far enough .

"A promising young soldier on Christmas leave was killed and his girlfriend seriously injured in a crash while 'racing' a 22-year-old taking a BMW for a test drive at speeds of up to 100mph, an inquest heard. Fusilier Tony Emery, 24, was driving his girlfriend home in his new red VW Golf when he was flashed at and overtaken by a black BMW on the A666 near Bolton, Greater Manchester. As the driver Luke Stone, 22, drove past, it was claimed a race ensued with witnesses saying the soldier's Golf had tailgated the BMW 8318 at high speed. Tragedy: Fusilier Tony Emery, 24, (right) was killed and his girlfriend Paige Palmer (left) seriously injured in a crash while 'racing' 22-year-old Luke Stone, who was test-driving a BMW . Stone (pictured) returned to the BMW garage after the crash and went on a second test drive . Fellow motorists said they saw the pair 'caning it' along the dual carriageway before tragedy struck when Mr Stone braked to avoid being caught by a speed camera, the inquest into Fusilier Emery's death was told. Fusilier Emery veered into the left-hand lane to avoid ploughing into the back of the BMW but his V6 car slew out of control. It spun off the road, hit the speed camera, flipped over and landed in a ditch. Firefighters cut Fusilier Emery free from the vehicle but he was pronounced dead at the scene from multiple injuries. His girlfriend Paige Palmer, 20, an aspiring model who was in the front passenger seat of the Golf, was left with a broken neck, hip and pelvis and now requires a wheelchair. Fusilier Emery, who was stationed in Cyprus with the Second Battalion the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, was back at home to see his family in Bolton after Army training in Canada when the crash happened on January 6. Injuries: Miss Palmer in hospital with her relatives after the crash. She was left with a broken neck, hip and pelvis and now requires a wheelchair . The solider, who was described by his colonel as 'very highly regarded' and 'going places', had extended Christmas leave as he was up for promotion to Lance Corporal and was due to be posted to a base in Tidworth, Wiltshire. The crash occurred as he was driving Miss Palmer home at 11am after staying with her at his brother's house. In statement read to the Bolton hearing Miss Palmer said: 'Tony and I were just talking and it was then I first saw a black BMW doing about 50mph in the fast lane. 'I saw the BMW cut in front and I said to Tony 'oh d*******'. Miss Palmer said the BMW then drove away as if 'showing off' and added: 'He kept going fast then slow. He would drive really fast then brake. It happened about five times. 'I think if I had been driving I would have thought he was teasing us. I was thinking it was like an insurance job and him wanting us to go into him. Tony got fed up about it and slowed down and turned to go into the left-hand lane.' Passenger: In a statement, Miss Palmer said she and Fusilier Emery had been talking when she noticed a BMW travelling at around 50mph in the right-hand lane. She said it then cut in front of the couple's car . She said that as Fusilier Emery veered into the other lane, the back of the Golf swung out and went into a spin. She said: 'I screamed. Next thing I woke up in hospital. The first thing I said when I came around was 'is Tony okay and is he in hospital?' 'It was a few days later when I was told Tony had died. They did not want to tell me straight away because of shock. I was devastated. Now if I am not in bed I am in a wheel chair. I have not been given a time scale in relation to recovery.' Couple: Fusilier Emery with Miss Palmer . Another witness, Anthony Boyle who was driving a Ford Transit Van said: 'The BMW undertook me really fast and pulled through the gap between me and the other car. How it got through the gap is beyond me. As the BMW went over the bridge it came up behind the Golf. I could see the Golf in front of the BMW and the BMW was right up the Golf's rear end. 'The Golf moved over and went into lane one and the BMW sped up and then it got to the side of the Golf. I do not know if they were saying stuff to each other but the BMW sped off and the Golf pulled out behind it. The BMW driver was a lunatic.' Matthew Ward, who was a passenger in a Mercedes van, said: 'I remember Ben the driver saying ""look at those idiots racing"". Ben moved out across into the left hand lane quite quickly to get out of the way. They were going between 90 and 100 mph.' David Snodgrass  was driving a silver Ford Focus at the time of the crash. 'I was going the speed limit because I don't like driving but they were caning it,' he said. 'It was unbelievable. They were more or less touching - bumper to bumper. The Golf driver was right up the bumper. Me and my girlfriend said how bad they were both driving and they next minute you just saw dust. I didn't see the collision. In my head it was like road rage.' A fourth witness Alan Marsh said: 'There was a 'whoosh whoosh' sound when they went past. The black car past first followed by the red. I would say they were travelling at 70mph. I would say they were then a cars length apart. When they got in front by about 100 yards I could see the brake lights come on the red Golf and he made a manoeuvre into the left lane. 'There was a lot of dust and it was as though he has gone over, hit something and has propelled up a bit and off the road.' His wife Shirley added: 'I thought I saw the black BMW brake. There was a speed camera as you come around and I thought he braked and then the red car braked and moved over. I though he was going to undertake.' The inquest heard a visibly shaken Mr Stone drove on after the crash and returned the car to the Bolton BMW dealership where he told the salesman he had just witnessed a collision. Shortly afterwards he was taken out for another test drive along the same stretch of road in the same vehicle where he saw emergency services at the scene. As the salesman drove past, Mr Stone, who was in the passenger seat put his head his hands and told him: 'Oh my god, I hope he is alright.' Mr Stone was later arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving but was not charged due to lack of evidence. Crash: Miss Palmer said that as Fusilier Emery veered into the left-hand lane, the back of the Golf swung out and went into a spin. She can remember nothing more of the crash . Rising star: Fusilier Emery was described by his colonel as 'very highly regarded' and 'going places'. He was set to be promoted, and the inquest heard he was 'on the threshold of a long and distinguished career' He denied racing and teasing Fusilier Emery in the moments before the crash. 'The VW was in the outside lane driving quite slowly doing about 50-60mph,' he told the hearing. 'I went behind him for a while - not tailgating but indicating for him to move over. 'From what I remember he straddled the middle, pulled back out and in again.' Mr Stone said he flashed the headlights at Fusilier Emery to move across but added: 'He gestured slightly. I remember the windows being transparent. I remember seeing him through the mirror - sign with his hand from what I can remember. 'As I drove past, we looked at each other. I just put my hands on my head as if saying what is he doing. But he looked quite angry and was swearing and asking me to pull over and stuff. 'Sometime after I looked in my rear view mirror and noticed he was right behind me. I tried to ignore him as I knew I was coming off to BMW garage and thought last thing I wanted was for him to follow me back there. 'I remember thinking I needed to slow down for the speed camera. 'I remember passing through and looking at the camera to see if it had flashed and just seeing something veer off the road. It took a while to register what had happened.' PC David Dale, a forensic collision reconstruction officer said both drivers had been going faster than the road's 50mph limit. 'Both vehicles were travelling in the offside lane and in excess of the 50mph speed limit before the drivers braked,' he said. PC Dale said the cause of collision was a loss of control on the Golf 'induced by harsh braking and steering.' Recording a narrative verdict, Coroner Alan Walsh said: 'Tony was on the threshold of a long and distinguished career and for him to die at the age of 24 is unimaginable and difficult to comprehend.'","Fusilier Tony Emery, 24, died in the crash on the A666 near Bolton .

"Row: MP Louise Mensch has been angered by comparisons with glamour model Jordan made by Michael Gove's wife .

"A fascinating archive of vintage adverts showing the birth of the so-called 'Pimm's party' has emerged to mark the launch of the drink's first new flavour in 190 years. The adverts date back to the 1950s when the economy took a nosedive after the Second World War and many people socialised at home to save money. It is thought the marketing team behind the gin-based drink realised this and launched the idea of a Pimm's party as a way to encourage sales of the beverage. A fascinating archive of vintage adverts showing the birth of the so-called Pimms Party, this one focusses on snacks . The company sent out leaflets in 1950s to the 1960s which included top tips for the perfect social gathering. The marketing campaign worked and The 'Pimm's Party' soon became popular. Party suggestions included games such as Flipping The Kipper, where guests were instructed to race paper fish by flapping them with cardboard. Another was the Match Box Race, in which two rows of people passed a matchbox from their nose to another person's. Food ideas included Celery Dreams, celery sticks filled with mashed salmon and tuna, and Shrimp Thrills, prawns, eggs, and mayonnaise in pastry. Other canapes that were popular at the time were 'Double-decker Glories' which were layered sandwiches of chicken, almonds, and pineapple and Cheese Crackers. The company sent out leaflets in the 1950s and 1960s which included top-tips for a perfect social gathering . The ads, like this one on ice breakers, date back to austere post-war Britain when people found it cheaper to socialise at home . Pimm's soared in popularity because it cost just 48 shillings and sixpence for a 75cl bottle which served 14 half pints when mixed with lemonade. The drink was deemed a perfect accompaniment to small snacks at parties because it was initially invented as an aperitif. The recipe for Pimm's was created in the 1840s by James Pimm, who was a fishmonger and owner of an oyster house. He came up with the secret concoction of gin, herbs and liqueurs and served it in a small mug known as a Number One Cup as an aid to digestion. There were also other variations of the drink made with rum, scotch, brandy, rye, and vodka, but they were later discontinued. Pimm's has now launched a new flavour, Blackberry and Elderflower, for the first time in nearly two centuries. It can be served warm and could rival mulled wine this Christmas. An instruction manual follows the tongue-in-cheek statement 'Ninety-nine years ago, people had to give parties without any Pimm's' A bottle of Pimm's from the 1950s . A more modern bottle of Pimm's . The new blackberry and elderflower Pimm's . James Pimm created Pimm's as as aperitif to accompany his oysters around 1840 . Alia Campbell, an archivist . at Pimm's, said: 'We believe Pimms was invented in the 1840s and we have . evidence to show that James Pimm was in business in 1823. 'We . looked in the London directories and it showed he was a shell . fishmonger and it is thought that he created Pimm's as as aperitif to . his oysters. 'There were . originally six flavours of the drink made with different spirits, the . number one cup was gin, but they were also made with rum, scotch, . brandy, rye, and vodka. 'Pimm's . was also a restaurant chain and I believe the last one to close was in . the 1950s, about the same time as the launch of the Pimm's party. Other variations of the Pimm's drink made with rum, scotch, brandy, rye, and vodka were discontinued . James Pimm mixed gin, herbs and liqueurs and served it in a small mug known as a Number One Cup as an aid to digestion . Pimm's cost just 48 shillings and sixpence for a 75cl bottle which served 14 half pints . 'By this point the business was focusing just on the drink - its famous number one cup - and so it was a good way to market the product. 'The adverts we have found in the archive for the Pimm's parties are in the style of leaflets and they give tips on how to have the perfect party. 'They include recipes for nibble-style food to accompany the drink and to serve to guests, which could draw on the roots of Pimm's back to when it was originally an aperitif. 'The leaflets even came with free invitations and coasters to make the perfect party. 'It was quite fashionable at that time to have dinner parties and although women were allowed in pubs, it was still a very male- dominated world. 'Pimm's have now launched the Blackberry and Elderflower-flavoured drink which can be served hot or cold and would be a fantastic alternative to mulled wine.'

"Paramount Australia has apologised after accidentally referencing 9/11 in a new poster for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The studio shared the poster on Tuesday through its official Twitter page, which showed the four turtles diving from an exploding building alongside the date it hits Australian cinemas - September 11. The unintentional, but unmistakable connection to the terrorist attacks on New York's World Trade Centre was met with swift backlash and outrage on social media, and was deleted shortly after the oversight was pointed out. Scroll down for video . Controversial: Paramount Australia has sparked outrage after promoting the September 11 release of the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film with a poster showing the heroes falling from an exploding building . Ill-advised: The tweet sharing the promotional poster was quickly met with angry responses on social media - some of which called for those behind the release to lose their jobs . Since then, Paramount Australia issued a statement saying 'combining that image and date was a mistake'. 'We are deeply sorry to have used that artwork for the marketing materials promoting the September 11 opening in Australia,' the statement said. 'We intended no offence and have taken immediate action to discontinue its use.' The film, which stars Megan Fox and Johnny Knoxville, is released in August in the United States and October in Europe, but its Australian release date comes exactly 13 years to the day after 19 hijackers took control of four airliners and carried out the deadly September 11 attacks. The controversial poster evoked anger due to its visual similarity to the 9/11 terror attacks, which claimed the lives of 2,996 people. One of the Twitter replies, posted by user @MorningAfterKill said: 'So who's getting fired for this poster art? September 11? Exploding buildings? People falling out of them? Le sigh'. Another message by @AusFestivus added: 'Guys. Sept 11 and exploding buildings is a bad look okay', while a third tweet, by @yilmaz16, said: 'Really 9/11? Jumping out of an exploding building?' Paramount has since deleted its original message showing off the movie poster, and has tweeting several considerably less controversial images from the upcoming release. Advice: The reason the poster proved controversial was due to the unfortunate release date of September 11 and the use of an exploding building to promote the film . Anger: The poster was shared on Paramount Australia's Twitter page last night, and immediately drew dozens of negative comments from angry film fans . Outrage: Paramount has since deleted its original message showing off the movie poster, and has tweeting several considerably less controversial images from the upcoming release . Resemblance: The poster evoked anger due to its visual similarity to the 9/11 terror attacks (pictured), which killed 2,996 people in 2001 . After New York's famous Twin Towers were struck by two aircraft coming up to 13 years ago, there was a period of between one and two hours before they collapsed during which dozens if not hundreds of people were seen leaping and falling to their deaths from the burning buildings. Out of the 2,996 people killed in the four coordinated attacks, 11 of them were Australian citizens. As yet Paramount has issued no statement or apology about the controversial poster, nor has it made any explanation of the decision to release the new film on the anniversary of the attacks.","Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film is released on September 11 in Australia .

"Amanda Miles, 40, thought it 'entirely acceptable' for a black worker to be given the nickname 'golliwog Brian' at her multi-million pound firm, a tribunal ruled . The owner of a multi-million pound firm failed to stop her staff calling another employee 'golliwog Brian' because she did not think there was anything wrong with the nickname. Amanda Miles, 40, 'tolerated a culture of racism' at her fruit and vegetable wholesaler, an employment tribunal found. Brian Ennis was given the nickname and also called 'black Brian' to distinguish him from a white worker with the same first name, the wholesaler admitted. Another black worker, a delivery driver who was so upset by the racist behaviour that he quit, has been awarded £27,000 in compensation after a panel ruled that having to listen to racist nicknames had 'violated his dignity'. Roy Morgan told Bristol Employment Tribunal that a colleague ordered him to 'stop speaking that jungle talk' as he chatted to another driver in patois. And bosses at the firm did not discipline a white driver who said that 'black people should be burnt at the stake like Jews', despite a complaint from an employee with Jewish heritage. The tribunal awarded Mr Morgan £13,427 in 2011 for racial harassment and recently ruled he should receive a further £14,286 for lost earnings from constructive dismissal. Ms Miles was 'entirely unreceptive' to the idea that the name-calling might offend black staff, it ruled. But Mr Morgan is unlikely to see a penny of his award because the firm has recently gone into administration. During the tribunal, the company falsely suggested that Mr Morgan had once been to prison. Mr Morgan, who represented himself, was so upset by the lie that he stormed out of the tribunal. Speaking after the case, Ms Miles branded the judgment 'absolutely ridiculous'. She said: 'Brian Ennis did not have any issues. He is not shy and if he had wanted to bring up the names with me, he would have done. He could hold his own. 'The tribunal was the most pathetic process I have ever come across in my life.' Mr Morgan joined the Gloucester-based firm run by divorcee Ms Miles and her partner Sean Linturn, 44, in September 2007. It had nearly 30 employees and an annual turnover as high as £4.2 million. The drivers earned about £300 per week and swearing was common in the warehouse, the tribunal heard. The company did have an equal . opportunities policy but this was kept in a filing cabinet and none of . the employees or managers knew it existed. In November 2008, Mr Morgan brought a book on health and safety into work. Driver Roy Morgan successfully sued Halls of Gloucester for racial discrimination and constructive dismissal but is unlikely to see a penny of his £27,000 compensation because the firm has gone into administration . The tribunal found: 'Ms Miles lost her temper with the claimant. When he gave it to her, she threw it back at him. Ms Miles also pushed the claimant out of her office.' Mr Morgan quit that day, citing harassment and discriminatory practices in his resignation letter. The panel concluded: 'The claimant worked for an employer that tolerated not only racial banter in the workplace but also the expression of extreme forms of racial prejudice. 'The claimant found this comment to be offensive and was concerned that no steps appeared to be taken to address it. 'This was known about by Ms Miles. It did not occur to her to take any steps to curb this practice as it did not occur to her that there could be anything wrong with it. 'Ms Miles was entirely unreceptive to the notion that calling someone by the colour of their skin could cause offence.

"This breathtaking set of pictures captures the skyscrapers Hong Kong from the perspective of the mass of humanity which swarms at their feet. French graphic artist Romain Jacquet-Lagrèze captured the vertigo-inducing vistas on a visit to the city, which he credits with inspiring within him a passion for photography. 'It's easy to get a measure of a building from afar, but you can't really appreciate a towering city structure until you've craned your neck up the length of its spine, admiring the way its reflective edges seem to scrape the sky,' he said.

Dizzying: The remarkable reflections created by . the mirrored glass on this building resemble the artistic optical . illusions of the surrealist M.C. Escher . With a population of seven million squeezed into an area of just 426 square-miles, Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated areas in the world. That lack of living space, combined with a vibrant capitalist economy based on low taxation and light-touch regulation, spurred demand for ever denser constructions which have made it the world's most vertical city. Stunned by this architectural 'race to the sky', Mr Jacquet-Legrèze says he felt the need to use his camera to create this set of pictures, entitled Vertical Horizon, to share his feelings about the city. 'Hong Kong is not a 2-D place that follows the flatness of a map but instead a volumetric place, where elevators leading us to restaurants, shops, home or our working place should deserve their own street names,' he said. 'Vertical Horizon is a reminder on how we are nothing more than a bee in the big beehive, chipping in our bit into the greater realm of society.' Mr Jacquet-Lagrèze is a French graphic artist with a Masters in multimedia and art from East Paris University. His interest in photography began during his period of working in Los Angeles and Tokyo, and subsequently blossomed into a passion after his arrival in Hong Kong. He said it's the geometry of the urban environment and the vivid lives it shelters which are the aspects of Hong Kong that inspire him most.

'Being conscious of our humble condition, to me, is the first step to move to our full potential and reach for our vertical horizon. 'The name Vertical Horizon is an obvious reminder of our competitive Hong Kong skyline where each building is trying to be the tallest, the boldest, the most beautiful, the youngest, the oldest or the most famous.'

"Migrants have helped push Britain’s birth rate up to one of the highest levels in Europe. Women here are now likely to have an average of just under two children – a level exceeded only in two of the other 27 European Union countries. A decade ago, before large-scale immigration had a major impact on birth rates, Britain was firmly in the middle of the European table. Britain in bloom: Women in the UK are now likely to have an average of . just under two children - a level exceeded only in two of the other 27 . European Union countries . Since then, high fertility levels among migrants and a rapid rise in birth rates among women born here have helped push up the population faster than almost everywhere else in Europe. Figures released by the EU’s statistical arm Eurostat show the British birth rate – an average of 1.98 children per woman – had raced ahead of those in Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, Malta, Holland and Finland by 2010. All six had higher birth rates than the UK in 2000. Only women in France, with a birth rate just ahead of ours at 2.03, and Ireland, at 2.07, have more children. Just over 723,000 babies were born in England and Wales in 2010, up from fewer than 600,000 in 2000. The average number of children each woman is likely to have has gone up from 1.64. The main reason for the increase was immigration, with many migrants of child-bearing age, and with many from cultures where larger families are more common. The rising birth rate is also partially attributed to those born here in the 1960s and 70s having children later because they have been focusing on careers. Having children has for many also been delayed by the need for a couple to maintain two incomes to cover mortgage and other costs. Other European countries where birthrates have fallen have accepted fewer numbers of migrants than Britain and have not so far shown the same resurgence in baby numbers among women who in recent years have been delaying childbirth. France has had higher birth rates than Britain since the 1990s and its fertility levels are also pushed upwards by the arrival of high numbers of immigrants. The rising birth rate is also partially attributed to those born here in the 1960s and 70s having children later because they have been focusing on careers . Most recent figures show British birthrates have remained steady since 2010. The Office for National Statistics said this may be because of ‘Government policy and the economic climate indirectly influencing individuals’ decisions around childbearing and therefore affecting the number of births.’ However it added: ‘The combined effect of multiple government policies and the changing economic climate does not have a clear impact on fertility in a particular direction.’ High birth rates in Britain are generally reckoned to be responsible for around 30 per cent of population increase. The growing population, especially in the south, has made England the most crowded country in Europe, except for tiny Malta.",Women in the UK now likely to have an average of just under two children .

"Only three weeks after having a facelift, Sky News presenter Kay Burley was back in front of the camera. Yet in the immediate aftermath of the operation, she could barely look at herself in the mirror. Miss Burley admitted that the cosmetic surgery left her bruised, scarred and looking as if she had been in a car crash. 'Money well spent': Kay's lined neck before surgery in February shows signs of ageing (left) while her new look is a lot smoother (right) ‘It’s a deeply traumatic procedure,’ she said. ‘It’s not painful at all, but when you look at yourself in the mirror, you think, “I’m never going to be me again”.’ The glamorous divorcee bought herself the lower face and neck lift earlier this year, after celebrating her 50th birthday, and said she was thrilled with the results. A decade ago she had an eye lift after turning 40, and she has not ruled out going under the knife again. Back on air: Burley returned to work three weeks after the operation . She insisted that she had not felt under pressure to look younger for  her job, despite recent ageism rows including Countryfile  presenter Miriam O’Reilly’s successful legal action against the BBC. ‘People say, “It’s because you’re on the telly”,’ she told the Times. ‘No, it’s because I’m a woman and I want to look nice. ‘If Mother Nature needs a helping hand, why not? ‘I’ve always tried to take care of . myself, but this was something that no matter how many calories I burnt . off, it didn’t make any difference.’ ‘I . don’t want to be a poster girl for having cosmetic surgery, but I’m . very happy to say, “Don’t be frightened, do your research, choose the . right  surgeon, and if you still want to go ahead, then don’t worry”.’ Familiar face: Kay Burley, a presenter for Sky News, is a household name . Miss Burley said she spent months researching her planned operation and selecting the right surgeon. She compared it to choosing a plumber, saying: ‘When you have your plumbing done, you get three quotes. It’s a bit  like that.’ She chose Rajiv Grover, the president-elect of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, who performs more than 100 facelifts a year. The mother of one said she had not told her son she was going into hospital until after the operation, because he was studying for his A-levels and she did not want him to worry about her. She did not reveal how much the operation cost, but said it was ‘money well spent’.",Sky News presenter said surgery left her bruised and scarred .
"Princess Michael was said to be ‘very distressed’ last night after a Russian tycoon romantically linked to her was shot dead in a contract murder. Mikhail Kravchenko, 46 – who had been pictured holding hands with the princess, 67, during a holiday in Venice – was found dead in an upmarket neighbourhood outside Moscow yesterday morning. The bullet-riddled body of the millionaire, who had remained friendly with the princess, was discovered in a pool of blood beside his Mercedes in the  suburb of Peredelkino. Uneasy: Prince Michael looks on as Kravchenko casts an admiring glance at the princess at the Moscow conference in 2005 . The furniture tycoon was said to have been hauled from his car and shot up to ten times. Police confirmed it was carried out by two ‘professional’ gunmen who knew his whereabouts. There was also a suggestion that there had been a mystery passenger with Mr Kravchenko in his car who later vanished. It is not clear whether Mr Kravchenko may have fallen out with government figures before his death. Police believe his murder could be connected to an attempt to seize his £130million-a-year furniture business, or to debts he ran up during the recession. An unnamed source also claimed that before his death Mr Kravchenko had ‘branched out into Russia’s real estate and construction markets’, both of which are ‘notoriously corrupt’, as the furniture market slowed down. The source said: ‘We cannot rule out the common scenario for such shootings – a debt he couldn’t repay or a dispute over ownership of a company or property. Hand-in-hand: Princess Michael of Kent with Russian millionaire Mikhail Kravchenko in Venice, where they spent four days together. Kravchenko was found dead yesterday . Princess Michael, 67, whose close relationship with the tycoon saw him dubbed her  ‘toyboy’ and was the subject  of intense scrutiny six years ago, was last night said to be  devastated by the news of his murder. Simon Astaire, spokesman for the Kents, said: ‘Prince and Princess Michael of Kent are very distressed to hear of this tragedy.’ The princess – nicknamed ‘Princess Pushy’ because of her over-confident manner – has always denied having an affair with Mr Kravchenko, 21 years her junior. But in 2006 the two were pictured holding hands and staring lovingly into each other’s eyes while enjoying a stroll and a gondola ride in Venice. The princess was also reported to have booked a suite at one of Venice’s most expensive hotels for herself under the assumed name of ‘Mrs Green’. Princess Michael of Kent with Russian millionaire Mikhail Kravchenko were alleged to have shared a suite at the Cipriani, one of Venice's most glamorous hotels . At the time, Princess Michael’s spokesman Mr Astaire said the pair – who had met at an interior design exhibition the previous year – had simply forged a friendship after Mr Kravchenko confided in her about the death of his wife and daughter in a car crash in 2001. ‘She has been seeking to be supportive,’ Mr Astaire said. ‘It’s not an affair.’ And later, the princess herself spoke out to deny the claims. She told Hello! magazine: ‘The true nature of our relationship is that it is a very good friendship. ‘I hold hands with all my friends. I don’t think that’s being intimate at all. I’m a very tactile person – I do it all the time.’ Later, Mr Kravchenko also denied claims of an affair, saying: ‘We (the princess and I) have just normal human relations. We are friends.’ Last night Moscow was awash with rumours surrounding the death of the tycoon, who was regarded as one of Moscow’s most eligible bachelors. The pair were pictured enjoying a day out together in a gondola during their stay in Venice. Both denied an affair was taking place . Russian look: The Prince in front of Red Square and the glamorous Princess of Kent attending a charity dinner. Both have strong links with Russia . The two royals and the Russian tycoon together. Princess Michael has strongly denied claims of an affair, but said she and Kravchenko are good friends . Police said he had been driving only yards from a luxury house he built for his parents at around 2am when he was overtaken and the road blocked. He was then shot five times in the body before being dragged from his car and shot in the head. Some accounts suggested a total of ten shots had been fired. Last night shocked friends insisted he had had no enemies. Unusually for a wealthy Russian businessman, he was often seen without bodyguards and was described by friends as one of the most ‘modest and unassuming’ of Russia’s super-rich. Friends insisted that his dozen or so businesses in furniture, construction and real estate were all solvent and that despite his vast wealth he had never bothered to hire bodyguards because he had no fears for his safety. One, his aide Marina Sherstyuk, said the news had come ‘like a blow of thunder from a clear sky’. Miss Sherstyuk said everything had been ‘normal’ when she last saw the businessman on Friday at a furniture exhibition. Battle: Boris Berezovsky appearing at the High court in London for his dispute with Roman Abramovitch . ‘There was absolutely no sign of problems, or tension, no cars following him, no threats – nothing at all indicating that his life could have possibly been in danger,’ she said. ‘He would have never even bothered with bodyguards, he felt no need to use them. He felt no threat at all. For us, as for the inner circle of people who worked closely with him, it was an absolute shock to hear.’ Prince Michael was in Russia last week without the princess. He flew to St Petersburg to be awarded with a degree by a Russian university for services to British-Russian relations. But his trip was overshadowed by revelations that he had accepted £320,000 in secret payments from Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, a leading foe of president Vladimir Putin. The payments via an offshore company from Mr Berezovsky, who is exiled in London, were disclosed in court documents. The oligarch’s spokesman said: ‘Mr Berezovsky has known the prince since the early 1990s and has a high regard for the prince’s work. He therefore chose to be supportive over a period which ended some years ago.’","Mikhail Kravchenko caused a royal scandal after being pictured holding hands with the princess .

"Behind bars: Eddie Ray Routh is  charged with two counts of murder after shooting Kyle and Chad Littlefield at a shooting range in Texas . The Iraq War veteran accused of killing a former Navy Seal sniper and his friend on a Texas shooting range before making off in the victim's pickup told his sister he had 'traded his soul for a new truck', it has been claimed. Eddie Ray Routh, 25, is charged with the murders of Chris Kyle, author . of the best-selling book 'American Sniper,' and his friend Chad . Littlefield at a shooting range in Glen Rose. He is on suicide . watch in the Erath County Jail, where he's being held on $3 million . bond. Routh had been taken to a mental hospital . twice in the past five months and told authorities that he was suffering . from post-traumatic stress disorder, police records show. According to an Erath County arrest warrant  affidavit obtained by WFAA-TV after the shootings Routh told his sister and brother-in-law that he 'traded his soul . for a new truck'. Police . said that Routh was driving the truck of victim and ex-Navy SEAL Chris . Kyle at the time of arrest. Routh, a member of the Marines Corps Reserve, was first taken to a mental hospital on Sept. 2 after he threatened to kill his family and himself, according to police records in Lancaster, where Routh lives. Authorities found Routh walking nearby with no shirt and no shoes, and smelling of alcohol. Routh told authorities he was a Marine veteran who was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. 'Eddie stated he was hurting and that his family does not understand what he has been through,"" the report said. Routh's mother told police that her son had been drinking and became upset when his father said he was going to sell his gun. Scroll down for video . Storm: Kyle wrote a graphic memoir, American Sniper, about his four bloody tours of Iraq, released last year . She said Routh began arguing with them and said he was going to ""blow his brains out.' Police took Routh to Green Oaks Hospital for psychiatric care. Dallas police records show Routh was . taken back to the same mental hospital in mid-January after a woman . called police and said she feared for Routh's safety. Green Oaks will not release patient . information, citing privacy laws. Most people brought by police to the . hospital are required to stay at least 48 hours. In May, Routh's mother reported a . burglary that included nine pill bottles and her son was involved, . according to a Lancaster police report. No other details were available. Authorities say Routh, Kyle and . Littlefield arrived at the sprawling Rough Creek Lodge at about 3:15 . p.m. Saturday, and a hunting guide called 911 about two hours later . after discovering the bodies. Kyle and Littlefield were shot multiple . times, and numerous guns were at the scene, according to the affidavit. Scene: The shooting took place at Rough Creek Lodge in Glen Rose, Texas earlier this month . Routh drove to his sister's house, . and told her that he killed two people and that he planned to drive to . Oklahoma to evade Texas authorities, the affidavit said. Routh's sister . then called police, and he was arrested after a short police pursuit in . Lancaster. Jailers used a stun gun on Routh on . Sunday night after he appeared ready to assault them when they entered . his cell after he refused to return his food tray, the sheriff said. Then they put Routh in a chair that restrains his arms and legs in his . solitary confinement cell, Bryant said. Bryant said Routh has an attorney but hasn't met with him at the jail in Stephenville, about 75 miles southwest of Fort Worth. While in Iraq, Kyle survived being shot twice . and he lived through six separate IED explosions as his unit, Charlie . company of SEAL Team Three, saw significant combat . Kyle recorded more than 150 sniper kills - the most in U.S. military history - between 1999 and 2009 . Attempts by The Associated Press to reach Routh's mother and sister were unsuccessful Monday. Sundae Hughes, an aunt of Routh's, . said she watched him grow up but hasn't seen him since his high school . graduation in 2006. Hughes was in disbelief that her nephew could be . involved in such an incident. 'He has a kind heart (and was) someone willing to jump in and help, no matter what it was,' she said. Routh joined the Marines in 2006 and . rose to the rank of corporal in 2010. His military specialty was . small-arms technician, commonly known as an armorer. He had been stationed at Camp Lejeune, N.C., and served in Iraq from 2007-08 and in the Haiti disaster relief mission in 2010. Caught: Police searched for Routh for hours following the shooting on Saturday afternoon but he was found after his sister called him in, as he fled to her house in Kyle's pick up truck and proceeded to confess to the killings . Criticism: Former Texas congressman Ron Paul posted a controversial message about the shooting . He is now in the individual ready . reserve. He could be called to duty, but it's uncommon unless he . volunteers, 1st Lt. Dominic Pitrone of the Marine Forces Services public . affairs office said. Travis Cox, director of FITCO Cares . -- the nonprofit that Kyle set up to give in-home fitness equipment to . physically and emotionally wounded veterans -- said he believes that . Kyle and Littlefield were helping Routh work through PTSD. Cox didn't know how Routh and Kyle knew each other. He said the shooting range event was not a FITCO session. Kyle, 38, left the Navy in 2009 after . four tours of duty in Iraq, where he earned a reputation as one of the . military's most lethal snipers. 'American Sniper' was the No. 3 seller of paperbacks and hardcovers on Amazon as of Monday, and the hardcover was out of stock.

"Huma Abedin has yet to decide whether she will stay with her disgraced husband and her longtime boss Hillary Clinton. Abedin has worked for Mrs Clinton for more than 15 years and it is believed that the former first lady gave her an ultimatum, saying that either she ditches husband Anthony Weiner or she will not hold a high office in Clinton's expected 2016 campaign. 'Hillary is horrified by Weiner, and thinks that he is an embarrassment to his accomplished wife. She wants Huma to leave him behind. But Huma is torn between her family and loyalty to Hillary,' an unidentified source told The New York Post. Turning point: Huma Abedin defended her husband at this July 23 press conference following more revelations about his sexting habits but then she was rarely seen on the trail. He went on to lose the race by a massive margin . Weiner's sexting problem first prompted his resignation from Congress in 2011, but it also led to his dramatic downfall in this year's mayoral primaries. Sticking together: Abedin and Weiner have a son, Jordan, which will weigh in her decision whether or not to leave the marriage . He decided to compete to be the next Mayor of New York City and Abedin was largely at his side for the beginning of the campaign. She even stood by him and made a public statement defending him when his latest sexting partner Sydney Leathers released transcripts of their conversations and pictures of his genitals that he sent to her. The Clintons were very clear that they were actively staying out of the city's Democratic primary race since they had close ties to a number of the candidates- including both Weiner via Abedin and the winner Bill de Blasio who helped run Clinton's senate campaign in 2000. While they may have been remaining neutral while Weiner was in the race, multiple reports have hinted that they are decidedly against Weiner now that he both embarrassed himself in the polls and Abedin in the process. The unnamed Clinton source reportedly told The Post that if Abedin chooses to stay with her husband, she will be 'looked after' and still be given a job with Clinton's campaign. That said, the role would be less high profile than it could be, as many would expect Abedin to be Clinton's top campaign manager or chief of staff given how closely they have worked in the past. A representative for Clinton said that the reports of an ultimatum are 'totally false'. Laying the groundwork: Since leaving her post as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton has been ramping up her public appearances which many have seen as her approach towards a White House run . Abedin is one of Hillary Clinton's most trusted advisers and would be expected to be a key part of her team if she enters the 2016 presidential race . As for notoriously private Abedin, actions may be speaking louder than words as she was never seen at her husband's campaign events following the Leathers revelations and she was pointedly out of the city on the primary Election Day. She wasn't completely out of the loop, however, as she did attend the consolation party that Weiner held at his brother's restaurant last week.","Hillary Clinton's longtime aide Huma Abedin is married to former politician Anthony Weiner .
Weiner lost his bid to become the next mayor of New York City when another woman came forward revealing they had a sexting relationship .
Abedin was at his side for much of the campaign but now has retreated and is staying more private .

"Grilled: Gabby Logan was repeatedly asked about her children back home . She was delighted to be part of the BBC team sent out to Brazil to cover the World Cup football tournament. But Gabby Logan was annoyed to be repeatedly asked: ‘Who’s looking after your children?’ Her nine-year-old twins Reuben and Lois were left at home with their father, former Scottish rugby star Kenny Logan, 42, while Mrs Logan, 41, was working in Brazil. And despite admitting she was relieved when England were knocked out because it meant she could go back to being a mother, Mrs Logan expressed surprise that people still think a woman’s place is in the home. In a new interview she said: ‘People still think it’s a woman’s responsibility to organise everything. When I was away, some of the mums at school asked Kenny how he was coping. 'No one asked me that when he was working in Australia last year. I’m often asked who’s looking after the children when I’m away, yet my male colleagues aren’t.’ Mrs Logan went on to admit she was secretly pleased to be leaving Brazil when the England football team were knocked out. The former gymnast, who also presented at the 2012 Olympics, said: ‘England’s early exit from the World Cup was a silver lining because I could go home to see my kids. 'It was good to get back into a routine again, although Lois assumes the role of the woman of the house when I’m away, and she was a bit put out on my first day back. She said, “Oh, Mummy, I missed you”, but it was like she felt she had to say it!’ Of course, there may be another reason Mrs Logan was glad to be home, after tweeting and blogging about the poor standard of the hotel she was staying in. She posted a photograph of her room’s faulty hairdryer on social networking site Twitter, while moaning on her blog that the laundry service had misplaced some of her clothes. And she was miffed one night when she found the burger bar she wanted to eat dinner in was closed for a private event. But Reuben and Lois would not have known about their mother’s complaints – neither of them are interested in social media. Mrs Logan told Essentials magazine: ‘I’m mindful of my children being exposed to the Internet as they’re getting older. You worry about what they’re going to find. They know about Twitter and Facebook, but they’re not interested at the moment.’ Scroll down for video . Caring: Gabby and Kenny Logan are pictured above with their twins Reuben and Lois . The football World Cup, which was won by Germany, saw 272 members of BBC staff travel to Brazil to provide TV and radio coverage. At the time the corporation faced criticism over the size of the line-up, while others thought there should be more women on the team. But Mrs Logan said she didn’t see the point in sending more females ‘for the sake of it’. She said: ‘There was an outcry when the BBC unveiled their line-up for the World Cup and I was the only woman. But there were no gaps on the presenting team. 'If you’ve got someone like Dan Walker doing his job brilliantly, why should the BBC push him out and put a woman in for the sake of it? It happens in other industries, not just football. There aren’t enough women at the top in science, in boardrooms, or in the Cabinet.’ As it happened, Mrs Logan emerged as the BBC’s top performer, as her male colleagues faced abuse. Reflecting on public reaction to her calm presenting style, which she has previously said is down to doing yoga, she said: ‘I just wonder whether I’ve weeded out the idiots or blocked them all, but during the World Cup I received lots of positive comments for the first time. 'There were a few people who tweeted that I’d asked the wrong question in an interview, which is fair enough, but it wasn’t comments about my looks or genitalia I’m glad to say.'","Mrs Logan was constantly asked about twins Reuben and Lois while away .

"Potentially harmful: A wider classification of symptoms for ADHD in the psychiatric 'bible' used by the profession has led to a steep rise in diagnosis and prescriptions for medication, the study warned (picture posed by model) The diagnosis of ADHD may have become too broad, leading to needless and potentially harmful treatment for some children, researchers warn. A wider classification of symptoms for ADHD in the psychiatric ‘bible’ used by the profession has led to a steep rise in diagnosis and prescriptions for medication, the study warned. The group of researchers from Australia and the Netherlands said there was now a risk of over diagnosis which could fuel scepticism about the disorder. In addition, stretched resources may mean some seriously affected children do not get medical help, or they are undertreated. In recent years, the term ADHD has been given to a collection of behavioural problems linked to poor attention span including impulsiveness, restlessness and hyperactivity. Around three to seven per cent of children are believed to have ADHD, about 400,000, with many being prescribed drugs to try and improve their concentration at school. Prescriptions for stimulant drugs such as Ritalin increased twofold for children and adolescents in the UK, and fourfold in adults between 2003 and 2008. There have been similar rises elsewhere despite little data showing the long term benefits of treatment, says Rae Thomas, a senior researcher at Bond University in Australia, and colleagues. In a report published on bmj.com (must credit), they say Australian data shows a 73 per cent increase for ADHD medication between 2000 and 2011. Prescriptions for stimulant drugs such as Ritalin increased twofold for children and adolescents in the UK, and fourfold in adults between 2003 and 2008 . Prescribing in the US increased steadily between 1996 and 2008 - mostly for adolescents aged 13-18 years - with estimated drug costs up to $500m. Such medications can cause adverse reactions such as weight loss, liver toxicity, and suicidal thoughts, and in the short term may suppress pubertal growth. Dr Thomas said ‘Compared with children with asthma, children with ADHD have been described as lazier, less clever, and less caring, and they are also more likely to be stigmatised.’ Having a diagnostic label often means teachers and parents have low academic expectations of them potentially creating a self fulfilling prophecy, she added. To be diagnosed with ADHD, a patient should meet diagnostic criteria outlined in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) - used around the world to classify mental disorders - or International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Diagnosis: Around three to seven per cent of children are believed to have ADHD, about 400,000, with many being prescribed drugs to try and improve their concentration at school (picture posed by model) But definitions have been broadened in successive editions of DSM, resulting in higher rates of the disorder when compared with ICD 10, Although clinicians are likely to have got better at detecting and diagnosing ADHD, some of the rise could stem from overdiagnosis or misdiagnosis. ‘Severe cases of ADHD are obvious, but in mild and moderate cases - which constitute the bulk of all ADHD diagnoses - subjective opinions of clinicians differ’ says Dr Thomas. ‘The broadening of the diagnostic criteria in DSM-5 is likely to increase what is already a significant concern about overdiagnosis. ‘It risks resulting in a diagnosis of ADHD being regarded with scepticism to the harm of those with severe problems who unquestionably need sensitive, skilled specialist help and support’ she added. Prof Eric Taylor, Emeritus Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, King’s college London, said the UK was different because NHS guidelines already recommend careful specialist assessment, with psychological treatments given priority over medication in most cases. ‘Probably too few children here get help’ he said. In the UK, the increase in stimulants was from a very low base rate: 4.8 per 1,000 schoolchildren in UK compared with around 70 per 1,000 in parts of the USA. Prof Taylor said ‘The increase in the UK follows an increased ability in the medical profession to recognize ADHD; but all too many children with severe problems still go untreated.’ Prof Philip Asherson, Professor of Molecular Psychiatry at the MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry centre at the Institute of Psychiatry, King’s College Londo, said ‘This paper makes a set of arguments relating to the inappropriate use of the diagnostic criteria for ADHD. ‘I would see their arguments as largely correct, and does explain the potential dangers of over diagnosis of ADHD. ‘However, they are not against the diagnosis and treatment of children with ADHD when this has been properly evaluated by specialists.’","Wider classification of ADHD symptoms has seen rise in diagnosis .

"Doctor Who has come under fire after a scene featuring stars Peter Capaldi and Jenna Coleman pulling out their hair sparked complaints from sufferers of a rare disorder. The BBC sci-fi show has been branded it 'insensitive' following a scene which left sufferers of trichotillomania 'upset' and 'uncomfortable'. Series eight began last Saturday with the new Doctor, Peter Capaldi, 56, and his co-star Jenna Coleman, 28. Scroll down for video . Jenna Coleman, who plays Clara Oswald (left), and Peter Capaldi (right) as Doctor Who at the beginning of the scene as he appears to scratch and rub his hands through his hair before pulling out a strand . Clara Oswald watches in surprise as the Doctor tugs at the strand in the first episode of the eighth series . Capaldi then reaches over and pulls out a strand from his co-stars head as she exclaims in pain . But the hour-long programme caused controversy at the half-way mark during a scene between the Doctor and Ms Coleman. Around 36 minutes in, the Doctor, who at the time was seen to be in an intense conversation with Clara Oswald (Ms Coleman), appears to begin to pull his hair out before then pulling out the hair of his co-star. After pulling her hair out he remarks to Clara 'it was the only one out of place, I am sure you would have wanted it killed'. Quickly after the short scene finished, sufferers of trichotillomania and Dr Who fans took to social media to slam the BBC for showing the scene which could be seen as a trigger to some people. Trichotillomania is an uncommon way of harming where the inflictor pulls their hair out. It’s classed as an obsessive compulsory disorder and can affect anyone. Unfortunately there is still no known cure for the life-long disorder. Rebecca Brown, 21, from Chelmsford, Essex, vlogs about life with trichotillomania and has criticised the BBC . As a result of her videos, Rebecca, pictured here in 2012 with bald patches from condition, has huge following . Rebecca, pictured left in 2009 and right as she is today, published a six-and-a-half year time-lapse video on her YouTube channel last year in the hope that it would help other people suffering from the condition . Popular video-blogger Rebecca Brown, 21, known as Beckie0, who has over 185,000 subscribers on YouTube and suffers from the condition quickly vented her anger online. In a YouTube video titled 'Triggered By Doctor Who' which has had almost 14,000 views, she said: 'I sat down to watch Dr Who to enjoy myself, I didn’t expect it to include triggering content. 'I just wasn’t prepared, when I know something is coming I can turn off or close my eyes but it is pretty hard when you are suddenly met with it unexpectedly.' Doctor Who fans slammed the BBC on social media  saying scene could trigger trichotillomania sufferers . She continued to say how she then went online to voice her concerns, which were met with a mixed reaction from the Dr Who ‘fandom’ which she explained left her feeling 'frustrated'. Miss Brown, from Chelmsford, Essex, who stated she 'loves Dr Who' added: 'I was just getting frustrated about how many people misunderstood where I was coming from. 'I don’t think people appreciated what it felt like for myself and others to sit in front of the telly watching them tear hair out, it just wasn’t right. Trichotillomania is a condition where a person feels compelled to pull their hair out - either from their head, or places such as their eyebrows or eyelashes. The condition is an impulse-control disorder - a psychological condition where the person is unable to stop carrying out a particular action. Sufferers experience an intense urge to pull their hair out - and growing anxiety until they do. Once they have achieved their goal, they feel a sense of relief - despite their actions often causing bald patches. Trichotillomania can cause negative feelings, such as guilt. According to NHS Choices, many sufferers feel embarrassed or ashamed about pulling the condition - either trying to conceal the damage or denying it exists. It is not known what causes trichotillomania, but there are several theories. Some experts believe hair pulling is a type of addiction, others believe it may be a symptom of a mental health problem and a way of relieving stress or anxiety. In some cases, trichotillomania may be a form of self-harm, where a person will deliberately harm themselves as a way of seeking temporary relief from emotional distress. Source: NHS Choices . 'I can’t even talk about it without triggering others, this is quite difficult for me to verbalise what I am trying to say. 'The thing is, if those actors in the scene were performing a different type of action that was similar to more well-known form of self-harm then I think more people would have picked up on it. 'Because it was trichotillomania, trichotillomania is not rare but unknown, no one really cares because they don’t know there is a disorder where people actually pull out their hair. 'I am aware that the BBC did not specifically include that scene to cause harm, for all I know they might not know trichotillomania exists. 'I know it wasn’t a malicious act towards ""trichers"", also I appreciate that there are just some times where you can’t research everything. 'If everyone had to think before they spoke to create any content then no one will be able to voice anything through fear of triggering or upsetting anybody else. Concluding, she said herself and others found the scene 'upsetting' but added she doesn’t think much can be done regarding the issue before saying her 'rant' was over. It is estimated that there are one million sufferers of trichotillomania the UK with most of them being women. Fans on Twitter vented their anger and branded the BBC 'very insensitive'. One user, Kara Andrews (@Kanameleth), wrote: 'I am NOT happy with the hair pulling bit during #DoctorWho. Very insensitive to trichotillomania.' Another, James Dark Raven (@LilyRabbitLover) added: '#DoctorWho Good episode overall but some slightly insensitive parts to people with facial disfigurements and Trichotillomania.' @LetsBeatTrich, a support group for Trichoillomania tweeted: 'Doctor Who did contain some #trich triggers. I became very uncomfortable at that moment, and wish I’d had warning. Be careful guys! A BBC spokeswoman said: 'We will not be commenting on this'.","BBC show has been branded 'insensitive' after scene left viewers 'upset'

"The conduct of ten police officers identified though Professor Alexis Jay's (pictured) report into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham is to be investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission . Ten officers are under investigation by the police watchdog over the Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal, it was confirmed today. The Independent Police Complaints Commission said the South Yorkshire Police officers whose conduct will be investigated were all identified through the Jay Report. The report, published in August, found that more than 1,400 children had been subjected to child sexual exploitation in the town between 1997 and 2013. In her report, Professor Alexis Jay criticised the way in which South Yorkshire Police and Rotherham Council dealt with complaints from teenage girls who said they had been raped and trafficked by gangs of mainly Asian men. The IPCC said the officers are part of a group of 13 referred to the watchdog by South Yorkshire Police. The other three officers, who were identified through a separate internal review by South Yorkshire Police rather than the Jay Report, will not face investigation at this time. The IPCC has decided that two do not justify an investigation involving the commission at this stage and the status of the third remains under review. IPCC Commissioner Kathryn Stone said: 'The amount of public concern across the country about this episode and the impact on confidence in the police means it is important that a fully independent investigation is conducted to establish how South Yorkshire Police dealt with child sexual exploitation. 'I sincerely hope that victims and their families will see this investigation as a positive step towards answering the many questions they must have. I have met with South Yorkshire Police and am reassured by their commitment to fully cooperate with the investigation.' The spotlight first fell on Rotherham in 2010 when five men, described by a judge as 'sexual predators', were given lengthy jail terms after they were found guilty of grooming teenage girls for sex. The five men - Umar Razaq, Adil Hussain, Razwan Razaq, Zafran Ramzan, and Mohsin Khan - preyed on their victims over several months and threatened them with violence if they refused their advances. One of the men branded his victim a ‘white bitch’ when she resisted, while a second smirked: ‘I’ve used you and abused you.' The men, all British-born Pakistanis, attacked the four girls in play areas, parks and in the back of their cars, Sheffield Crown Court heard. South Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commissioner Shaun Wright (pictured), who was the Rotherham councillor overseeing children's services between 2005 and 2010, resigned in the wake of the report's release . They gave them gifts and introduced them to their friends. The girls were abused so frequently that after many months it ‘became a way of life’. The girls, who were being monitored by social services, were eventually rescued by police and removed from their homes amid growing concerns for their safety. In her report, Professor Jay said senior police and council officials must have known what was happening but failed to act, with staff reluctant to report their concerns out of fear of being called racist. Children as young as 11 were trafficked, beaten, and raped by large numbers of men between 1997 and 2013, the council commissioned review into child protection revealed. The report found that 1,400 children were sexually exploited in Rotherham over a 16-year period. Adil Hussain (left) and Razwan Razaq (right) were jailed in 2010 for grooming young girls in the town . Zafran Ramzan, 21, (left) was jailed for nine years and Mohsin Khan (right) for four in the same case . Umar Razaq was another of the five-strong sex gang jailed and placed on the sex offenders' register . More than a third of the cases were already know to agencies, but according to Professor Jay: 'Several staff described their nervousness about identifying the ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought racist'. She condemned the 'blatant' collective failures by the council's leadership, concluding: 'It is hard to describe the appalling nature of the abuse that child victims suffered.' Fears had also been raised by schools over the 16 years but the alerts went uninvestigated. Teachers reported seeing children as young as 11, 12 and 13 being picked up outside schools by cars and taxis, given presents and mobile phones and taken to meet large numbers of unknown men in Rotherham or other local towns and cities. The majority of victims believed the perpetrators to be their boyfriend who gave them gifts, alcohol and drugs. Some of the victims still maintain they were not groomed or abused. Analysing the case studies, Professor Jay said many of the children came from dysfunctional families, had parents with addictions, and had suffered domestic or sexual abuse as a child. Today the IPCC has identified seven parts of the report, which was published in August, that could lead to misconduct allegations against the officers under investigation. These include claims that one officer argued against the category of sexual abuse being used because he believed the child had consented to the incident. There are also allegations that evidence relating to a suspected rape was lost, and that two officers had failed to properly investigate an incident in which a young girl was found drunk in the back of a car. The controversy that followed the publication of the Jay Report report led to a series of high-profile resignations including Rotherham council leader Roger Stone, council chief executive Martin Kimber and council director of children's services Joyce Thacker. The most high profile resignation was that of South Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commissioner Shaun Wright, who was the Rotherham councillor overseeing children's services between 2005 and 2010. South Yorkshire's chief constable David Crompton has also been under pressure to explain his force's attitude towards CSE over the last 15 years. Mr Crompton has pledged to investigate individual cases and stressed that his force has seen a massive increase in the number of officers and other staff devoted to tackling CSE in the last couple of years. Last month, the the National Crime Agency (NCA) announced it would lead an investigation into outstanding allegations of CSE in Rotherham. The NCA said it was taking on the inquiry following a request from Mr Crompton. Today the IPCC identified seven parts of the report, which was published in August, that could lead to misconduct allegations against the officers under investigation. These are: .","IPCC says the conduct of ten officers will be investigated .

"Arrest: Ryan McPherson (pictured in court in 2003) was jailed over the TV series Bumfights, in which homeless men attempt amateur stunts in exchange for money, alcohol, and other incentives . Thai police have issued arrest warrants for two Americans who attempted to mail a preserved baby's head, foot and other human body parts to the United States, saying the objects were stolen from a Thai medical museum. The bizarre case has quickly gained international attention, with Thai police asking Cambodian authorities to help locate the men, who travelled to the neighbouring country on Sunday. The FBI is helping with the investigation in the U.S. Police questioned Ryan McPherson, 31, and his friend, Daniel Tanner, 33, in Bangkok over the weekend but released them and allowed them to travel to Cambodia. New evidence then emerged after their departure, prompting the arrest warrants to be issued on charges of theft, possession of stolen items and falsely declaring items on shipping documents, said police Major General Sombat Milintachinda, the head of Bangkok's police investigation bureau. 'Our evidence indicates that they either stole the body parts, or they bought them from other people,' he said. 'We have to bring them back for more questioning.' Yesterday, it was revealed the pair are film-makers who previously served time in prison for producing TV show called Bumfights that paid homeless men to fight each other. The body parts - which police believe were stolen from a Bangkok hospital's 'Museum of Death' - were stored in plastic containers filled with formaldehyde, wrapped and addressed to  Las Vegas. DHL alerted police who tracked down McPherson and Tanner and took them in for questioning. They told police they had bought the body parts at a Bangkok night market - an infant's head, a baby's foot sliced into three sections, an adult's heart with a stab wound, and two slices of tattooed skin. The objects were preserved separately in acrylic boxes with formaldehyde. The men told police they thought the items were 'bizarre' and 'wanted to ship them to friends to surprise them', Maj Gen Sombat and other police said. Thai police officers show pictures of tattooed human skin during a press conference in Bangkok . But new details surfaced yesterday when one of Bangkok's biggest hospitals, Siriraj Hospital, said the body parts had been stolen from its anatomy museum and its forensic medicine museum - which the two men visited last week. Surveillance video showed the pair at the registration counters of both museums on Thursday, the same day police said they arrived in Thailand, said Udom Kachintorn, the medical dean at Siriraj Hospital. The theft charge carries a jail term of one to five years or a fine of up to 10,000 baht (£195), while the false declaration charge carries a penalty of six months in jail and a 500,000 baht (£9,715) fine. All three packages were being sent to Las Vegas, including one that McPherson had addressed to himself. Police said they contacted the FBI to get information about the would-be recipients of the items. Policemen show pictures of body parts found in parcels as they address reporters in Bangkok . Police say one of the packages contained an adult 'sheet of skin' with tattoo markings . In Washington, FBI spokesman Minique Crump said they were aware of the matter and looking into it. In Las Vegas, FBI spokesman Bridget Pappas also said investigators were trying to determine whether laws had been broken by the Americans. The controversial film-makers, from California, produced the popular TV series Bumfights, in which homeless men attempted amateur stunts in exchange for money, alcohol, and other incentives. But they were arrested after the first episode, Bumfights Vol. 1 – Cause For Concern, was released on DVD in 2002 and charged with misdemeanor charges of conspiracy to stage an illegal fight and sentenced to 280-hours of community service at a homeless shelter. When McPherson failed to show up to the work, he was jailed for 180 days. One of the homeless men involved in the video was even paid to have the word 'Bumfights' tattooed on his forehead. Gruesome: DHL staff made the startling discovery when they scanned three packages . In 2006, the filmmakers agreed to stop making Bumfights films and pay three of the homeless men featured  as part of an out of court settlement. The men were attempting to sue the film's producers for emotional and physical damages suffered by appearing in the Bumfights videos. The Nation newspaper said, citing a police source, that he had left for Cambodia but promised to return to Thailand on November 25 to co-operate with police. The second man has not been identified. In 2012, Thai police arrested a British citizen of Taiwanese origin after discovering six human foetuses which had been roasted and covered in gold leaf stuffed into travel bags at a hotel room in Bangkok's Chinatown. Thai detectives said they believed the corpses were due to be sent to Taiwan to be used as part of a black magic ritual. The three packages were being sent to Las Vegas, including one that a tourist had addressed to himself .","Police questioned Ryan McPherson and Daniel Tanner in Bangkok .

"Sir Bob Geldof has told the Plebgate libel trial that MP Andrew Mitchell had never patronised or derided him – even though he is a ‘pleb’ from a ‘poor Irish background’. The rock star and charity fund-raiser said the former Tory chief whip is not the ‘preposterous pantomime patrician’ he has been made out to be. Geldof insisted that the ‘Wodehousian superior manner’ attributed to the MP, who was educated at Rugby School and Cambridge University, was incorrect. Support: Musician Bob Geldof (left) has provided written evidence at London's High Court in support of his friend Andrew Mitchell (right, today, with his wife Sharon Bennett) In a statement submitted to the High Court, he said: ‘I am used to being patronised by “my betters”. There was no such nonsense from Mr Mitchell. ‘We are an unlikely pair of friends. I came from a poor Irish, not particularly well-educated background and he does not. I am in fact “a pleb” and he is not. 'Never once in all our time did he patronise me, talk down to me, behave in a superior manner to me, deride, insult or dismiss me or my opinions.’ The Boomtown Rats frontman admitted having ‘perhaps a justified reputation for swearing a bit’ and said that Mr Mitchell ‘was no slouch either’. However, he then added: ‘But not once did I ever hear him use the ridiculous and archaic expression “pleb”.’ In court: Mr Mitchell resigned as chief whip a month after the encounter with Pc Toby Rowland (above) Geldof, who was not in court, said he had a high estimation of Mr Mitchell’s probity as a man, his honesty as a person and his abilities as a professional. The pair worked together when the MP was International Development Secretary and Geldof told fellow activists to ‘trust what Mitchell is saying’. ‘He has never once let us down. This is a truthful, reliable, honest man,’ he said. ‘I have not a single shred of doubt that what Andrew Mitchell says is the truth.’ Geldof’s statement was one of a number of character witnesses submitted to the court. Fellow Tory MP Kenneth Clarke described Mr Mitchell as a man of ‘impeccable character’. ‘He can be a little hot tempered, but never in malice,’ he said. ‘I have never known him to be dishonest or untruthful in any way and I would be prepared to put a very great deal of confidence in anything that he told me.’ Lord Fowler, a former minister under Margaret Thatcher, did not believe Mr Mitchell would have used a word such as ‘pleb’. He said: ‘It came from another age and I had never seen any hint of class feeling in any of his dealings. Quite the opposite.’ Lord Fowler said the MP could not work in the HIV/Aids field in the outstanding way he did while harbouring views about class superiority. Mr Mitchell is suing News Group Newspapers over the allegation that, after being refused entry through a Downing Street gate on his bike, he told officers: ‘Best you learn your f****** place. You don’t run this f****** government, you’re f****** plebs.’ Mr Mitchell denies this, although he admits saying ‘I thought you guys were supposed to f****** help us’ after officers refused to open the gate in September 2012. News Group Newspapers argues that its article in The Sun was substantially true. Statements on Mr Mitchell: MP Kenneth Clarke (left) said he had 'always regarded him as a man of impeccable character', while Lord Fowler (right) said he did not believe that Mr Mitchell would have used the word 'pleb' Toby Rowland, the police officer Mr Mitchell reportedly called a ‘pleb’, is suing the MP for suggesting that he made up the allegations. Used 'fruity language': But Lord (Sebastian) Coe said he knew Mr Mitchell to be ‘a man of integrity’ Giving evidence under oath yesterday Pc Rowland insisted that Mr Mitchell did call officers ‘plebs’. He claimed he had no idea who Mr Mitchell was and did not know at the time what the word pleb meant. ‘It’s not a term I have used or any of my colleagues or friends use,’ he added. But James Price QC, representing Mr Mitchell, repeatedly challenged Pc Rowland over his version of events. He suggested that officer’s account of the altercation was full of inconsistences. Mr Price also said that the firearms officer was wrong to issue the MP with a warning for breaching ‘Section 5 of the Public Order Act’ for swearing. Pc Rowland defended his decision, saying: ‘What I am saying is if you use language or behaviour that causes alarm or distress then that is an offence.’ Mr Price said: ‘You are saying in this country it is a criminal offence to use the word f****** in public. The word f****** is in common use these days, isn’t it?’ The officer replied: ‘It is used regularly – but not by me – and that does not make it right.’ The case continues.

It shows free-standing graphene foam, which is made by growing layers of graphene on the surface of a porous metal foam skeleton, which was the dissolved so that only the foam remains . Along with three main winners, the Zeiss-sponsored competition had two extra categories this year: a prize for images taken using an electron microscope and a Head of Department’s prize for the photo or video with the most innovative engineering story behind it. The first prize was awarded to Indrat Aria, for his image entitled Asteroidea Electrica, which shows free-standing graphene foam, made by growing layers of graphene on the surface of a porous metal foam skeleton. The skeleton is then carefully dissolved so that only the graphene foam remains. Second prize went to PhD student Yarin Gal for his image of extrapolated art, extending past the edges of paintings to see what the full scenery might have looked like. He used the PatchMatch algorithm on the frame of Van Gogh's painting Starry Night to extrapolate its contents (pictured left). A pretty image of graphene flowers by Mari Ijäs is pictured . This image shows pulsed laser deposition, which was used to apply a metal layer to a glass slide. The technique is used for creating structures that induce thermal and electrical conduction across the surface of an insulator. The image was captured by Jonathon Parkins using an optical microscope . As it’s electrically conductive, highly porous and lightweight, graphene foam could be used in applications such as chemical sensing, energy storage and ultra-lightweight structures. Dr Aria used an electron microscope to take the image and then applied artificial colours to it.

Despite a lack of formal training, Francis took water to scores of local villages through ingenuity and hard graft. He jumped down the well and quickly sorted the problem – the rope had simply fallen off the pulley – restoring order so the day could carry on as normal. The Electron Microscopy Prize was awarded to Tanvir Qureshi for his image of a bridge forming in self-healing concrete. A sample was collected from the cement’s self-healing zone and put under a microscope, where flower-like bridges effectively expanded and healed the cracks. Worldwide, a significant amount of money is currently being spent on the repair and maintenance of existing concrete structures, although its demand is increasing.

Considering the growing concrete demand, environmental concerns, and the longevity of built infrastructure, suitable self‐healing technology adaptation in cement concrete is becoming a highly sought after technology. The Head of Department’s prize went to Andrew Payne for his video of the rise and fall of liquid crystal ‘mountains’. He made a video from a collection of images taken at one-second intervals. It shows the slow growth of liquid crystal structures under the influence of an alternating electric field, and their rapid collapse as the field is reversed. Entrants, including students, professors and other staff, were told that the images they entered may be ‘beautiful, fascinating, intriguing, amusing, or possibly all of these things’. The images were judged by experts at Zeiss, and Cambridge professors including Dame Ann Dowling, Dame Dowling is the first female President of the Royal Academy of Engineering. ‘We continue to be blown away by the beautiful images produced by our students and researchers for this competition,’ said Philip Guildford, Director of Research for the Department. ‘But more than just pretty pictures, these images also show how engineering is helping to solve problems, big and small, all over the world. While our winners were judged to be the best of this year’s entries, we received more than 250 diverse, beautiful and meaningful images.’ A color-coded map shows the output of a deep neural network applied at each point in the image.

"Electrical skin shocks to treat autistic patients who are self-harming may soon be banned in a Massachusetts school. The Food and Drug Administration is considering whether to stop the shock devices used by the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center in Canton. Self-injury is one of the most difficult behaviors associated with autism and other developmental or intellectual disabilities. Some of the patients at the private facility outside Boston cut themselves while others slam their heads against walls or desks - one girl did it so hard she detached both retinas while another patient pulled out all his teeth. Scroll down for video . Electrical skin shocks used by a Massachusetts school to treat autistic patients who are self-harming may soon be banned in a Massachusetts school. Pictured: A therapist checks the ankle strap of a shocking device on student Andrew Goldberg  at the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center in Canton . Andrew, who was born with a developmental disorder, wears the device to control violent episodes . The facility, which takes on some of the hardest-to-treat cases, is the only place in the country known to use skin shocks as aversive conditioning for aggressive patients. The review is a rare move by the FDA, following years of complaints from disability rights' groups and even a U.N. report that the shocks are tantamount to torture. FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg says the shock therapy has raised a lot of questions. With the remote control of a shock device hanging from his belt, a therapist watches as a physical education teacher helps student Andrew Goldberg (pictured) on a treadmill during an exercise program . Louisa Goldberg of Newton, Massachusetts, says the skin shocks are the only treatment that has worked for her son, Andrew, (both pictured)  who suffered brain damage at birth and became dangerously aggressive as he got older . Rotenberg must get a court's approval to begin administering skin shocks to a student . 'We really wanted to take a much more focused and rigorous look at it,' Hamburg said in an interview with The Associated Press. 'There's a lot of concern about the downside of this approach and the harm and the risk to the patients receiving it.' Rotenberg must get a court's approval to begin administering skin shocks to a student. The center uses a graduated electronic decelerator, or GED, that is attached to the arms or legs. Aversion therapy is a controversial form of therapy which is based on the premise that certain types of behaviour can be avoided if those displaying it associate it with an unpleasant feeling. This form of encouraging 'learnt behaviour', as made famous in the Anthony Burgess novel A Clockwork Orange, has received much criticism over the years. Questions have been raised over how effective the treatment is over the long-term while others have raised serious ethical concerns. According to SimplyPsychology, it is unclear why the shocks have certain effects, while the treatment is also believed to be less effective in the outside world away from the therapist. It is also said to have a high relapse rate. If the student acts aggressively — head-banging, throwing furniture, attacking someone — then a center worker can press a button to activate the electrode, delivering a two-second shock to the skin. Some patients compared the shocks to a hard pinch or bee sting. Others say it's far more painful; one said it was like being stung by a thousand bees. At an FDA advisory committee hearing this year, most of the neurology and ethics experts concluded the device poses an unreasonable and substantial risk, while acknowledging that other therapies don't work for everyone. 'I think that what has happened is that this has gone on for this long because this is a population who cannot adequately speak for themselves,' Dr. Karen Weigle, a clinical psychologist affiliated with the University of New Hampshire's Institute on Disability, told fellow committee members. Dr. Steven Miles, a bioethicist at the University of Minnesota, was one of several advisers concerned about the lack of scientific studies showing the shock therapy works. That only one treatment facility uses them, he said, makes it 'unreasonable to conclude that these devices are part of the standard of care for this class of patients.' But Louisa Goldberg of Newton, Massachusetts, says the skin shocks are the only treatment that has worked for her son, Andrew, who suffered brain damage at birth and became dangerously aggressive as he got older. Andrew Goldberg spent years at a New Hampshire facility, where his mother says he bit, hit and kicked staff members. When restraints did not work, workers tried medications to calm him. 'He was a zombie,' Louisa Goldberg said. Therapist Thomas Dohle comforts a student, who is wearing a waist pack holding a shocking device. Many students at the school, who were born with Autism and development disorders, wear shocking devices to control violent outbreaks . A female  student, wearing a shocking device on her leg, lines up with classmates after lunch . He was kicked out at age 19 and taken to Rotenberg, which weaned him from some medications and began the skin shocks. Now, at 33, Goldberg still gets a shock or two every month, but his mom says his life is better. 'Andrew is awake. He's alert. He's happy and he's functioning to the best of his abilities,' Louisa Goldberg said in an interview. 'We have our son back.' Rotenberg's executive director, Glenda Crookes, calls the shocks a last resort coupled with positive behavior programs, such as rewarding students with time at JRC's Internet cafe or the teen lounge with its arcade games. The idea is that the two-second shock is quick but painful enough to jar the patient out of the harmful episode. Of the 235 patients at the center, 55 are being treated with skin shocks. Most are in their 30s; five are between age 17 and 21. The FDA first cleared the GED device for use in 1994. But Rotenberg started using a more powerful version, about 2.5 times stronger, that was developed after one student built up a tolerance to the shocks. In 2000, the FDA said the newer device didn't need approval, but the agency changed its position in 2011 and said approval was required, eventually leading to April's hearing on whether to ban it altogether. Cheryl McCollins sued the center for malpractice after her autistic son, Andre, was shocked more than 30 times over approximately seven hours in 2002. A video shows Andre strapped face down and shocked because he would not remove his coat . Andre recovering after being shocked extensively - in the video he can be heard screaming, 'Help me. No' 'It's not safe. It doesn't feel safe. I ended up having nightmares,' Jennifer Msumba, 38, (pictured) testified via video at the FDA's hearing. She said the GED left burn marks and was prone to misfires, unintended shocks . The center insists it is safe, but some former students say otherwise. 'It's not safe. It doesn't feel safe. I ended up having nightmares,' Jennifer Msumba testified via video at the FDA's hearing. The 38-year-old said the GED left burn marks and was prone to misfires, unintended shocks. Msumba's mother is suing JRC. Her attorney says Jennifer Msumba, who has autism, was given more than 230 electrical shock treatments since 2002 and not permitted to take psychiatric medications. Msumba said she is less anxious at a new treatment facility in Florida. 'They help figure out what makes me want to do things that could be harmful so I can learn how I feel before it happens,' Msumba told the AP. Rotenberg representatives says the suit has no merit and that 'Jennifer made incredible progress' at the center. About 10 percent of people with intellectual disabilities or autism display self-injurious behavior. Severity varies widely and treatment should be individualized, said Dr. Louis Hagopian, program director of the neurobehavioral unit at Baltimore's Kennedy Krieger Institute. Hagopian was not part of the FDA panel reviewing skin shocks. The most studied approach - behavioral treatment - involves identifying what social or environmental factors trigger a patient's behavior, and then teaching the person coping skills plus altering their environment to decrease those problematic situations. Hagopian said medications that address mood, impulsiveness and other conditions also frequently are used. Jennifer Msumba's suit is not the first. Cheryl McCollins sued the center for malpractice after her autistic son, Andre, was shocked more than 30 times over approximately seven hours in 2002. In a surveillance video played in court, Andre is seen lying face down with his arms and legs tied to a restraining board. He can be heard screaming, 'Help me. No.' The center settled the suit. The center says that 'is not the same treatment approach JRC would take today.' Crookes, the center's executive director, said skin shocks would be suspended earlier and the center would take a closer look at potential triggers of aggression. Sharon Wood of Charlottesville, Virginia, fears a ban on skin shocks would return her 21-year-old son, Joshua, to the violent behavior that used to force her to lock herself in a room with her young daughter. Joshua Wood is profoundly autistic. His parents say they tried everything but the only thing that worked was the shocks. 'Do not take away what is saving his life,' Sharon Wood said in an interview as the FDA considers the ban. 'Don't take this away until you are convinced there are better alternatives.'","The Food and Drug Administration is considering whether to ban devices used by the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center in Canton .

"Police have discovered the mummified body of an elderly woman being kept in the same bed her daughter was sleeping in. The grisly discovery was made after neighbours because suspicious about not having seen the 83-year-old for some time. After social workers in the district of Blumenau, Munich, were refused entry to the home by the woman's daughter, police and firefighters were called to smash their way in. The woman's apartment was located in the city suburb of Blumenau, in the German city of Munich (pictured) Inside they discovered the mummified corpse of the elderly woman in the same bed her 55-year-old daughter slept in, The Local reported. The 55-year-old told police her mother had died in 2009, meaning she had slept in the bed beside the body for about five years. She was sent away for psychiatric tests. Earlier this year a New York woman was dubbed the 'real life Pyscho' after she was found to have been living with her mother's corpse for at least a year. She was also said to be putting it at the dinner table for a dining companion and cuddling next to it at night as she slept. According to The New York Post, Chava Stirn, 28, was discovered living with the corpse of her 61-year-old mother Susie Rosenthal when emergency services were called to the apartment in Borough Park in response to a complaint of a foul odor. Stirn was said to be behaving erratically and said she wanted to hurt herself. Her obsessions had gone so far that, like famous film murder Norman Bates, she even dressed up in her mother's clothes and was wearing the same black shoes and outfit Rosenthal had on when she died. The deceased's bones were resting on a bed of trash bags in the kitchen when authorities arrived. It was reported Stirn would often sleep next to the remains on a chair in the kitchen, leaving stacks of paper to cover her twin bed. She was apparently a shut-in who lived with her mother while the older woman was still alive and was taken to hospital for a psychiatric evaluation.","Woman found sleeping next to her 83-year-old mother's mummified corpse .

"The mother of Australia's most senior Islamic State militant Mohammad Ali Baryalei believes he is still alive, despite reports he was killed in Syria last month. Homira Baryalei said she had not heard from her son recently, but she still held hope that he was not one of a number of Australian Islamic fighters believed to have been killed in coalition airstrikes in Kobane. 'I don't know anything. I do not have any news about him. I believe he's alive,' Ms Baryalei told The Australian. Mohammad Ali Baryalei, who is alleged to have recruited half of the 60 Australians fighting in the Middle East, is also named as a co-conspirator in a terrorism plot allegedly planned by Sydney man, Omarjan Azari. Scroll down for video . Mohammad Ali Baryalei has been killed in the Middle East, according to a friend . A friend visits the home of Mohammad Ali Baryalei's mother, Homira, in western Sydney on Wednesday evening . Former Sydney nightclub bouncer Baryalei and Azari, who are both Afghani Australians, are named in Commonwealth terrorism charges laid after Azari, 22, was arrested on September 18 during a series of raids by counter terrorist police. According to court documents, police intercepted a phone call three days before the raids between Azari and Baryalei. Court papers allege Azari ‘did conspire with Mohammad Baryalei and others to do acts in preparation for, or planning, a terrorist act’ between May and September this year. Azari’s legal team says there was only one phone call allegedly from Baryalei in September, made around seven weeks before reports emerged of Baryalei’s death in Syria. Before working as a Kings Cross bouncer and then becoming a radicalised Muslim, Baryalei reportedly attended two Catholic schools in Sydney’s west. Baryalei recruited as many as half of the Australian militants fighting for the Islamic State terror group in the Middle East . One source told ABC about Baryalei's love for gambling, women, drugs and painted him as someone who mixed with questionable characters. 'He gambled a lot ... He once won $8,000 or $9,000 on the pokies, then played it back down ... and he loved cocaine.,' the source told the 7.30 program. The friend also said they thought Baryalei, originally from Sydney, may have gotten 'in too deep' in the scene, and it seemed as though he saw more than he could handle. The wanted terrorist is also said to have battled with mental illness growing up, suffering extensive bouts of depression which saw him confined to his room for days on end. A neighbour of the man seemed to echo these sentiments when speaking to The Sydney Morning Herald, telling of the man's troubles growing up. Neighbours said Baryalei's mother believed him to be overseas studying to be a cleric . In his prior life, Baryalei (left and right) was an aspiring actor who played a bit part role in Underbelly (right) He apparently suffered a traumatic childhood at the hands of his abusive father, and left home at just 17. Despite this Baryalei would still help out around the neighbourhood, doing 'odd jobs' for those who needed the help. 'He was a clean cut young man. Somebody must have gotten inside his head,' a source told the website. Meantime the Federal government is still trying to confirm reports that Baryalei - the most senior Australian militant in the Islamic State terror group - has in fact been killed. Abdullah Elmir, the 17-year-old who fled Sydney to fight for the Islamic State, is believed to have been recruited by Baryalei . Omarjan Azari, 22, was arrested and charged in the nation's largest ever terror raids last month. Prosecutors allege Baryalei conspired with him in a beheading plot . 'We are currently seeking to confirm whether the 16th Australian foreign fighter has indeed been killed in this conflict,' Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told parliament last month. As news filtered through of Baryalei's apparent demise, the neighbours of his parents in Sydney's northwest spoke about his mother's pain over her son's decision to join the radical group. The neighbour said Ms Baryalei had been devastated by her son's decision to take up arms with IS. 'She was crying. She couldn't believe it was her son,' she said. 'All she knew was he was overseas studying to be a cleric and would call her every so often. 'He was very protective of his mum.'","Homira Baryalei  still holds hope her son is still alive in Syria .

"'Deeply offensive': Jewish leaders have criticised John Prescott for comparing Israel's treatment of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip with the Holocaust . John Prescott was last night accused of being ‘deeply offensive’ to Jewish people by comparing the Gaza Strip to a concentration camp. The leaders of Britain’s Jews criticised the comments by the former deputy prime minister, saying they ‘trivialised’ the Holocaust and called on Labour officials to investigate his ‘misconduct’. Lord Prescott wrote in the Sunday Mirror that Israel’s ‘indiscriminate’ bombardment of the Palestinian territory was a war crime and that Gaza was a ‘ghetto’. Some six million Jews were killed by the Nazis during the Second World War, many in concentration camps, while many more were confined to ghettos in major cities such as Warsaw. Writing about Hamas, Lord Prescott said: ‘Israel brands them terrorists, but it is acting as judge, jury and executioner in the concentration camp that is Gaza. ‘What happened to the Jewish people at the hands of the Nazis is appalling. 'But you would think those atrocities would give Israelis a unique sense of perspective and empathy with the victims of a ghetto.’ The article provoked a stinging response from Vivian Wineman, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, and Mick Davis, chairman of the Jewish Leadership Council.

"Germany will ‘find ways’ to keep Britain in the European Union, including curbing migrants claiming benefits, a senior minister in Berlin said last night. Steffen Kampeter, Germany’s deputy finance minister, said it would be a ‘catastrophe’ if the UK severed ties with Brussels, including bringing ‘disadvantages’ for the British economy. He insisted that ‘UK belongs to Europe’ and suggested more could be done to meet Downing Street’s demands to tackle ‘benefit tourism’. Steffen Kampeter, Germany’s deputy finance minister, said it would be a ‘catastrophe’ if the UK left the EU . Relations between Germany and Britain have been tested in recent weeks, after Angela Merkel made clear that the general principle of freedom of movement is 'not negotiable'. It was claimed that the German Chancellor was ready for Britain to leave the EU if demands were made to limit migrant numbers. Mr Kampeter insisted the European project was based on ‘values’, in which Britain played a key part. He told BBC2’s Newsnight: ‘The great United Kingdom is part of this European integration. Culturally, philosophically and economically. ‘That they have questions on the size of the integration and special questions on bureaucrats in Brussels I very much agree. But there’s no doubt that the UK belongs to Europe.’ David Cameron has promised to stage a renegotiation of Britain’s membership of the EU, before holding an in-out referendum by 2017. Relations between David Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have been strained by demands from Britain to curb freedom of movement in the EU . He pledged to put freedom of movement at the heart of the talks with EU leaders. Senior Tories have suggested that unless the UK can extract a better deal from Brussels, it would be better to leave than remain in an unreformed institution. But Mr Kampeter said efforts would be made to find a way to stop the UK heading to the exit door. He said: ‘We’re not alone in saying that the Brits should stay on. We want them in and we will find ways to offer Britain a good chance to stay in. ‘And please do not forget opting out is not economically very preferable to the United Mr Cameron is expected to use a speech in the next few weeks to set out his plans to curb EU immigration. Number 10 insiders insist he is determined to tackle the 'huge numbers of people' who move to the UK for work. Mr Cameron has stressed: ‘The right to go and work in another European country should not be an unqualified right.’ However, Germany insists it will not allow changes to the principle of freedom of movement. Mr Kampeter added: ‘This is quite clear. But I clearly add that I understand that migration within the EU, into social security systems of single countries, is something we have to finance. ‘But I don’t think that the answer is to limit the free movement of persons. I think we need a European-wide legislation that makes clear that free movement does not mean free movement into social security systems.’ He said Germany has ‘similar problems’ and minsters are ‘trying to address them’. It follows a ruling by the European Court of Justice which said jobless EU migrants cannot move around the continent living off state handouts – and have no right to move to another country if they cannot support themselves. It ruled against a Romanian single mother who moved to Germany without a job, and made no effort to look for work, but demanded benefits designed for jobseekers.","Steffen Kampeter says it would be a ‘catastrophe’ if the UK left the EU .

"The man who voices the puppet of Elmo on Sesame Street has taken leave amid allegations he had a sexual relationship with a 16-year-old boy. Kevin Clash, 52, has taken a leave of absence from the popular children's show after the programme's lawyers were contacted by a 23-year-old man who claims he had a sexual relationship with the puppeteer seven years ago, when he was aged 16. TMZ, who reported the allegations, said that Mr Clash had admitted he had a relationship with the man, but only after the accuser was an adult and said the accusations were both false and defamatory. Allegations: Kevin Clash, the voice and movements behind Sesame Street's Elmo has taken leave amid allegations he had a sexual relationship with a 16-year-old boy . 'I had a relationship with [the . accuser].  It was between two consenting adults and I am deeply . saddened that he is trying to make it into something it was not,' said Mr Clash who joined Sesame Street in the mid-80s, . The website reported that after the . accuser's initial meeting with Sesame Street lawyers, he felt that that he was being silenced so he hired a lawyer. He is now being represented by Andreozzi and Associates - the firm that worked with one of the victims . in the Jerry Sandusky child rape case. Iconic: Kevin Clash, left, who has voiced Elmo for two decades, arrives at the 35th International Emmy Awards in 2007.  He admitted he had a relationship with the man, but only after the accuser was an adult . In August, the accuser's lawyers wrote a letter to Sesame Street accusing the programme of trying to 'discredit the victim in order to protect its . employee and the image of one of its most valuable characters,' The letter also claimed the show's attitude 'places a greater value on a puppet than the well being of . a young man.' But Sesame Workshop officials told TMZ  they found the  the allegation of underage sex was . unsubstantiated after a thorough . investigation. Legacy: Mr Clash joined Sesame Street in the mid-80s. Earlier this year he was the feature a documentary detailing Clash's childhood obsession with puppets to assuming his role on the iconic show . They claim rather than trying to hush up the accuser, they asked for evidence of his allegations, which was not received. The website reported they had seen an email supposedly sent to the accuser by Mr Clash, . acknowledging they had the affair when he was 16, but officials believe it is fake as they say the . accuser never mentioned such an email existed. Sesame Street disciplined Mr Clash for inappropriate use of company email after they found emails between him and the accuser, but they did not indicate an illegal sexual relationship, according to TMZ. It is unclear why Mr Clash wanted a leave . of absence, since he denies the allegations of underage sex, but the . programme told TMZ it was to allow him to defend his reputation in the wake of the damaging allegations. Mr Clash has been the Elmo puppeteer for two decades, performing on the show as well as for PBS specials, DVD releases and TV movies while earning nine Daytime Emmy Awards. He eventually assumed the title of Sesame Street's Senior Puppet Coordinator and Muppet Captain, while also directing and producing show segments and TV specials.

"Chancellor George Osborne has a special civil servant who guards his own padlocked fridge in the Treasury, it has been revealed. Lib Dem Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander revealed Mr Osborne had his own full-length fridge, which he kept under lock and key to stop colleagues raiding his milk. But sources have revealed there is also a Treasury insider known as ‘the Chancellor’s Messenger’ who has been given the job of guarding Mr Osborne’s fridge. George Osborne (left) has a padlocked fridge for himself in the Treasury, revealed Danny Alexander (right) The fridge is protected by a small padlock, which has been specially drilled into the door. Mr Osborne is understood to keep semi-skimmed milk and food in the 'double-length' fridge. His Lib Dem colleague in the Treasury Mr Alexander told a gathering of reporters this afternoon: 'It is fair to say that we have got our differences – I get my burgers from Burger King. 'We do share things – but not the milk which to my amusement he still keeps under lock and key. 'Yes really the fridge in the Treasury kitchen is replete with a padlock – it must have been tough in St Paul’s.' The Chancellor is known to keep close watch on his diet after ballooning in weight after the 2010 election. He was photographed last year wearing a computerised wristband that monitors exercise and sleeping patterns. He regularly jogs in St James’s Park opposite the Treasury and follows the 5:2 followed by celebrities including Beyonce, Philip Schofield and Benedict Cumberbatch. The diet means he has to fast twice a week. Labour’s shadow chancellor Ed Balls has previously been a devotee of the weight-loss plan. Mr Osborne has lost 'a couple of stone' since going on the 5:2 diet as well as undergoing a make over . Mr Osborne ditched the diet after losing ‘a couple of stone’. He revealed: 'I found myself putting on weight being stuck in here and the Treasury. I asked my doctor which diets he thought worked. He recommended the 5:2. 'I lost a couple of stone – and once you’re there, you just have to be careful. I just eat less and go running round the park.’ Mr Osborne also underwent a makeover by changing his hairstyle as a smart London hair salon. He has insisted he was always prepared for unpopularity after taking charge of the nation’s dire finances in 2010. The Chancellor was confronted with voters’ anger very publicly in 2012 when he was booed while handing out medals at the Paralympics in London. The Chancellor was pictured eating a burger in the Treasury before delivering the budget . He later hired Thea Rogers, a former producer for BBC political editor Nick Robinson, to manage his image. She is credited with his repeated visits to building sites, inevitably wearing hi-vis, to portray a more business-minded politician outside the Westminster bubble. But one of the most striking changes was unveiled at the Tory party conference in 2013, when his long, unruly style was replaced with the sharp, cropped look. At the time, Mr Osborne admitted that the new look was in part designed to disguise a bald spot. He joked that Michael Gove had told him: ‘You have applied your economic policy to your hairstyle. You have turned it around to stop the recession.’ A spokesman for Mr Osborne said the allegation that he had his own fridge under lock and key was untrue. The source said: ‘There is only one fridge with a lock on. It's communal and it is next to Danny's office.'","Treasury colleague Danny Alexander reveals Chancellor's special fridge .

"David Cameron was left humiliated after being defeated in the Commons today . David Cameron suffered a humiliating first defeat on a Coalition bill today after more than 40 MPs rebelled in a vote to help pubs buy cheaper beer. The Government had opposed plans to make it easier for pubs to purchase drinks from different brewers, but ministers were left embarrassed after they failed to head-off the backbench rebellion. Chief Whip Michael Gove faced shouts of ‘resign’ and ‘well done, Chief Whip’, after 17 Conservatives and 24 Liberal Democrats voted against the Coalition Government in its first legislative defeat since 2010. The rebellion was particularly embarrassing for Lib Dem Business Minister Jo Swinson, who had spoken for the Government during the debate, after the rebels included her husband Duncan Hames. Matt Hancock, who was one of the ministers responsible for the bill, was reportedly seen ‘grovelling’ to the Prime Minister after the vote. Some of the absent MPs are thought to have been on the campaign trail in Rochester and Strood ahead of today’s crucial by-election. The Government lost the vote after it opposed an amendment to its Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill to stop publicans being forced to buy drinks from the same brewer they rent from. Lib Dem MP Greg Mulholland, chairman of the Save The Pub campaign, who tabled the amendment, said it would stop landlords being charged ‘unfair and unrealistic rents and rip-off prices for beer’. But Miss Swinson opposed the move and said the Government would bring its own amendment when the bill was before the Lords. The amendment was passed by 284 votes to 259. Several ministers, including Home Secretary Theresa May and Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, missed the vote. More than 40 MPs rebelled in a House of Commons vote to help pubs buy cheaper beer today . The defeat comes after the Government narrowly avoided humiliation over the European Arrest Warrant last week amid scenes of chaos and confusion in the Commons. In January 2013, the Tories were defeated in the Commons on plans to redraw constituency boundaries before 2015, but that bill had not been brought jointly with the Lib Dems.","Government opposed plan  for pubs to buy drinks from different brewers .

"For more than 40 years, families have gathered to watch movie classic The Railway Children, with adults trying to hide their tears at the heart-warming tale. Now ratings body the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) has received its first complaint about the U-rated movie. But the moment which got the viewer steamed up was not when Jenny Agutter gasps ‘Daddy, my Daddy!’, prompting uncontrolled sobbing – it was the fear that the movie could encourage youngsters to play on railway lines. Odd: Ratings body the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) has received its first complaint about the U-rated movie The Railway Children. A scene from the film is pictured . But the BBFC, which has classified movies for a century, says the film illustrates the dangers clearly and is set in a very different time. The 1970 film, which stars Miss Agutter, Bernard Cribbins and Dinah Sheridan, has been a festive favourite for many years and is widely regarded as one of British cinema’s treasures. Based on the E Nesbit novel, it was filmed on the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway – masquerading as the Great Northern and Southern Railway – and chronicles the adventures of three children forced to move from London to Yorkshire when their father is imprisoned after being falsely accused of selling state secrets. The complaint about the footage is revealed in the BBFC’s annual report, which notes: ‘The correspondent was concerned that children may be encouraged to play on railway tracks as a result of seeing the film. Classic: This scene from The Railway Children shows actress Jenny Agutter, centre, playing Bobbie with Sally Thomsett as Phyllis and Gary Warren as Peter . ‘While aware of the real dangers of such . behaviour, the BBFC judged that it was very unlikely that The Railway . Children would promote such dangerous activity. ‘The Railway Children is set in the Edwardian period and trains and access to railway property are very different today. The film also demonstrates the potential harm to children if proper care is not taken.’ The most complained-about film of the year was The Woman In Black, which prompted 134 people to grumble the film was ‘too dark and unsettling’ for its 12A certificate. Men In Black 3 generated 50 complaints about bad language, violence, horror or sexual innuendo.","Complaint made to the  British Board of Film Classification .

"Treatment: The Professional Footballers’ Association of Ireland has said Ched Evans is 'being treated like the Guildford Four' in an article which describes the convicted rapist's crime as 'alleged' The Professional Footballers’ Association of Ireland has said Ched Evans is 'being treated like the Guildford Four' in a statement which also describes the convicted rapist's crime as 'alleged'. An article written by the union's solicitor and published on its official website claims the former Wales international could be innocent, and that even if guilty, he deserves a chance of redemption. Lawyer Stuart Gilhooly also refers to Evans’ crime as alleged despite the fact he was found guilty in court and served half of a five-year jail sentence. 'This crime, as alleged, was at the bottom end,' he wrote in the article, which was later removed. 'There was no violence and thankfully the victim has no recollection of it. This, I hasten to add, does not make it right, or anything close to it, but it is nonetheless a mitigating factor. 'It’s not easy to muster up too much sympathy for Evans but there is surely nothing worse than being accused of a crime which you genuinely believe you didn’t commit. 'The argument against that is that a jury convicted him of the crime. The same applied to the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six. They got no public sympathy either.' Evans was jailed in April 2012 for raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room in Rhyl, north Wales. The striker had denied raping the woman, saying the sex was consensual, but he was found guilty by a jury at Caernarfon Crown Court. He was released from prison last month after serving half of the five-year sentence. An appeal against Evans's conviction was rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in 2012. His case is due to be looked at by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. After his release, Evans put a video on his website protesting his innocence and vowing to clear his name as he apologised to girlfriend Natasha Massey for his infidelity. Last week the 25-year-old footballer was offered the chance to train with his former club Sheffield United, but the decision sparked a backlash from a series of high-profile supporters, including Olympic gold medal winner Jessica Ennis-Hill, who said she would ask for her name to removed from the club's ground if he returns full-time.

Footballer: Last week the 25-year-old was offered the chance to train with his former club Sheffield United, but the decision sparked a backlash from a series of high-profile supporters . It has since been reported that the club may not offer Evans a new contract because he is considered 'toxic'. However, in his article Mr Gilhooly wrote that another club, if not Sheffield United, would eventually make a move for him. 'How can Evans apologise?,' he wrote. 'He is convinced, and has a good argument, that he is not guilty of rape. If he apologised, then he is admitting a crime he feels he didn’t commit. Who would do that? 'But Ched Evans has served his time, whether he is innocent or guilty. He puts the ball in the net so eventually someone will take a chance on him.' Speaking out: Singer Paul Heaton (left) became the fourth high-profile Sheffield United patron to resign over the ongoing row, while Jessica Ennis-Hill said she would ask for her name to removed from the club's ground if Evans returns full-time . Stepping down: Heaton made the statement yesterday via his Facebook page where he told fans he saluted the bravery of his fellow patrons . Taking a stand: The stand was re-named in Ennis-Hill's honour after her 2012 Olympic triumph . The Guildford Four were released from jail in 1989 after their convictions for alleged roles in IRA bombings were overturned, while the Birmingham Six - jailed over similar allegations - had their convictions quashed in 1991. Mr Gilhooly's comments were removed from the website this morning and while he insisted he had no problem with the decision, he stood by the views. 'It was not taken down at my behest, but was removed with my consent and I have no difficulty with the PFA Ireland's decision to do so,' he said. 'The article reflected my opinion of the situation and did not seek to represent the views of the PFA Ireland or its members. 'I stand over its contents.' Stephen McGuinness, general secretary of the PFAI, confirmed that it had been the association's decision to remove the article from the website. 'We decided to take it down, it was our decision. We decided to take it down this morning as soon as we came in,' he said. 'The decision was not at the behest of Stuart, it was our decision to take it down.' Mr Gilhooly's comments came as a fourth high-profile Sheffield United patron resigned over the ongoing row. Former Housemartins and Beautiful South frontman Paul Heaton stepped down as a patron of Sheffield United’s Community Foundation, following the examples of TV presenter Charlie Webster, 60s pop star Dave Berry and Sheffield businesswoman Lindsay Graham since Evans returned to training with the Yorkshire club. Heaton made the statement yesterday via his Facebook page where he told fans he saluted the bravery of his fellow patrons. Former patrons: Heaton's decision to quit his post follows the examples of TV presenter Charlie Webster (left) and 60s pop star Dave Berry (right) 'Brave': Sheffield businesswoman Lindsay Graham also left her role at the Yorkshire club since Evans returned to training, and was praised by Heaton for 'standing up for rape victims' He added: 'I firmly believe that Ched Evans has the right to rebuild his career in football but rebuilding a career should not involve walking straight out of prison and into the shirt of the club he so badly let down. 'I believe he needs to move away and move on, and the club itself needs to lift its reputation out of the gutter.' Campaigners against sexual violence have also criticised the club’s decision to allow Evans to train with the team. Meanwhile Sheffield United have admitted they are 'appalled' by the abuse being aimed at people who have criticised the club's decision to allow convicted rapist Evans back to training. Twitter abuse was aimed at  local hero Ennis-Hill, who said that to allow Evans back into the Blades squad would 'completely contradict' her beliefs of being a role model to young people. She asked for her name to removed from a stand at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane ground if the club takes back Evans. 'I believe being a role model to young people is a huge honour and those in positions of influence in communities should respect the role they play in young people's lives and set a good example,' she said. 'If Evans was to be re-signed by the club, it would completely contradict these beliefs.' Within hours she was taunted with several sick tweets including one saying: 'I hope he (Evans) rapes her.' The League One club have pledged to work with South Yorkshire Police who are investigating the abuse. People who send this kind of abuse on social media or when chanting at grounds should not feel safe to make these personal attacks, the club said. Gerry Conlon, Paul Hill, Carole Richardson and Paddy Armstrong served 14 years of a life sentence after they were wrongly convicted of the 1974 Guildford pub bombings. They had been sentenced at the Old Bailey, after being found guilty over the deadly IRA attack on the Horse and Groom pub killed five people, including four off-duty soldiers, and injured 65. But the attack, and others in Woolwich and Birmingham, became better known for the huge miscarriages of justices they led to in the aftermath, with the public demanding the perpetrators be brought to justice. Wrongly convicted: Members of the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six, pictured in 2006 . Mr Conlon, Mr Armstrong, Mr Hill and Ms Richardson were jailed in 1975 for the Guildford bombing, while Mr Hill and Mr Armstrong were also jailed for the Woolwich bombing in which two people died. In a separate trial, The Birmingham Six - Paddy Joe Hill, Hugh Callaghan, Richard McIlkenny, Gerry Hunter, Billy Power and Johnny Walker - were convicted for carrying out the Midlands bombings. Later Mr Conlon's father Giuseppe, and members of the Maguire family - who became known as the Maguire Seven - were arrested and jailed for possessing and supplying the IRA with the explosives for the bombs. But all those involved protested their innocence and after years of campaigning their convictions were overturned. In October 1989 the Court of Appeal quashed the sentences of the Guildford Four after they had served 14 years behind bars, amid doubts raised about the police evidence against them. An investigation into the case by Avon and Somerset Police found serious flaws in the way Surrey Police handled the case. Emerging from the Court of Appeal a free man, Mr Conlon declared: 'I have been in prison for something I did not do. I am totally innocent. 'The Maguire Seven are innocent. Let's hope the Birmingham Six are freed.' In July 2000 the Prime Minister Tony Blair became the first senior politician to apologise to the Guildford Four. Freedom: Gerry Conlon, one of the Guildford Four, leaves the Old Bailey a free man in 1989 after his life sentence was overturned . Giuseppe Conlon died in prison in 1980, still protesting his innocence, and never saw his son freed. In June 1991 Giuseppe's sentence was posthumously overturned by the Court of Appeal along with those of the Maguires. The Birmingham Six also had their convictions overturned on appeal in 1991. Although the Guildford Four scandal has been known for 30 years the case files remain classified. Along with the Birmingham Six the material associated with the investigation and prosecution is held under the Official Secrets Act where it can remain shut to the public for 75 years. Mr Conlon, the best known of the Guildford Four, died in June of this year aged 60 after a long illness. His story was told in the 1993 film In The Name Of Our Father, in which he was played by Daniel Day Lewis.","Union lawyer Stuart Gilhooly says Evans deserves chance of redemption .

"You can find pretty much anything to buy on eBay, from cast-off clothing to entire homes and perhaps soon, Jose Canseco's severed finger. The former baseball star, and admitted doper, tweeted Monday night that he plans to list  his left middle finger on eBay, which he accidentally shot off last month while cleaning a handgun. Doctors at first reattached the finger after the October 29 accident, but the limb fell off while the 50-year-old retired slugger was playing poker last week and now appears to be unusable. Scroll down for video . Any bids? Former baseball star Jose Canseco accidentally shot off his left-hand middle finger last month while cleaning his gun at home in Las Vegas, Nevada. On Monday, he tweeted about selling it on Ebay . 'I will soon put the finger that fell off in the poker tournament on eBay for sale,' Canseco tweeted Monday night. 'The eBay ad will read slightly used middle finger with 462 home runs could be used as a stirring straw for drinks,' he joked. Canesco went on to offer the finger as a package deal, with the 45-caliber Remington gun that shot it off on October 29. However, it's almost certain that Canseco won't follow through with the plan, since eBay's policies do not allow the sell of firearms or human remains unless they are 'items containing human scalp hair, and skulls and skeletons intended for medical use.' Following the incident in October, he broke down while speaking to Inside Edition about the ordeal. Describing what happened, he said: 'At first I heard it go off and I actually grabbed the gun and put it on the table. '(I) thought nothing had happened. Then I look at my hand and my finger’s blown off.' Canseco explained the bullet only narrowly missed his fiance, swimwear model Leila Knight, who was standing nearby. She quickly ran to his aid. 'I was telling Jose not to look at his hand because he kept saying that he felt nauseous and said he was going to pass out,' Knight told Inside Edition. Knight wrapped his hand in a towel and called 911. 'I’m just glad nothing happened to her (Knight),' Canseco said. Accident: Canseco had returned from the shooting range on October 29, when he decided to clean his 45-caliber Remington handgun and it fired. Pictured left in 2013, and on the right with Oakland Athletics in 1992 . 'If it’s a lesson having to lose a finger, so be it.' Knight said her fiance had been at a shooting range a few days earlier. He then decided to clean the weapon but didn't realize it was still loaded. 'The middle finger was hanging by a thread, and I wrapped his hand in a towel and then called 911,' Knight told the newspaper. 'He blew away an artery and a big bone chunk.' The Cuban-American dominated the MLB with his hitting prowess in the 1980s, but later admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs for much of his career. Canseco is a right-handed batter who hit 462 career home runs and was a six-time All-Star. He also played for Texas, Boston, Toronto, Tampa Bay, the New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox during a career that spanned from 1985 to 2001.

"A belief that big is beautiful is causing a self-inflected obesity crisis in a West African country and putting the lives of women at risk. In  Mauritania, that lies between the Western Sahara and Senegal, women are encouraged to gain as much weight as possibly from childhood in order to be considered attractive. Having a fat wife is desirable and is a sign of wealth and prestige in the country where food is in short supply. Scroll down for video . Big is beautiful: In Mauritania an overweight wife is a sign of wealth and prestige . For more videos, please go to Journeyman.TV . In their quest to find a husband, . many of the women are being pushed to dangerous lengths to gain weight . from being force fed to taking pills that are not fit for human . consumption. U.S. journalist Thomas Morton was sent to  Mauritania to investigate the problem for the HBO documentary series, Vice. But he wasn't just to observe what was happening - he had to eat the diet of the Mauretanian women and take the pills they took to see what impact it had on his health. He found that girls are fattened up from the age of eight by their families in a practice referred to as 'gavage' - a French word that means force feeding and is used to describe the fattening of geese to make foie gras. Once they reach a marriageable age, girls are sent to 'fat camps' in the desert where they are fed 15,000 calories a day. For breakfast, the girls have breadcrumbs soaked in olive oil washed down with camel's milk. They then have frequent meals throughout the day of goat's meat, bread, figs and couscous, all with more camel milk to drink. Fattening up: Women are encouraged top consume 15,000 calories a day if they want to find a husband . Morton found that many refer to the over-eating as torture and parents . have been known to crush their daughters' toes with pincers if they resist. After trying the diet, Morton put on nearly a stone in two days and was left feeling bloated and unhealthy. 'Women can't have children because of . this type of gavage. The big problem is this often leads to heart . failure, repeated heart attacks, rare are the ones who escape' He said: 'It feels like the food has filled my entire chest cavity and is . now deflating my lungs.' He questioned how the women must feel having to do this over a lifetime given how terrible it made him feel after two days. Their obesity also means the women are more likely to suffer from  ill-health and develop problems like heart disease. Morton said he felt sick from the food he was having to consume, a problem often experienced by the Mauretanian women. So they have found another way to gain weight that's easier to stomach but just as damaging to their health - taking pills. Bloated: At desert 'fat camps' girls have to consume pints of camel's milk a day . One local woman told Morton: 'Medication is the modern form of gavage. Women use steroids and they are taking pills made from birds.These pills are not meant to be used by humans.' The women said the animal growth hormones end up giving the women who take them a disproportionate body shape with a big stomach, face and breasts but thin arms and legs. She said: 'The person now looks more like a seal than a human being.' The pill taking can also have dangerous side effects from infertility to heart failure. She said: 'Women can't have children because of this type of gavage. The big problem is this often leads to heart failure, repeated heart attacks, rare are the ones who escape. There are consequences - diseases, malformations and insanity.' In a separate study, Paula Braitstein from Indiana University and Moi University in the U.S. found that almost a quarter of women in Mauritania reported being force fed as a child and 32 per cent of women and 29 per cent of men in the country approved of the practice. Braitstein writes that 'these practices are unlikely to be discontinued in the near future without considerable effort to change cultural norms.'","Big is believed to be beautiful in the West African country .

"A senior executive at Uber made a grovelling apology after suggesting a plan to spend $1million on a team of researchers to dig up dirt on journalists who criticize his company. Emil Michael, who made the remarks at a private dinner in Manhattan, said he had dreamed up an eight-man team who would find out about writers' personal lives and families so that Uber could discredit them. The sinister scheme was targeted at a particular Silicon Valley female editor who has savaged the company for its alleged 'sexism and misogyny' - but drew an outraged backlash when it became public. Scroll down for video . Shocking: Emil Michael (pictured), Uber's senior vice president, reportedly proposed looking into journalists' 'personal lives' and 'families' while in the presence of a BuzzFeed editor at a private dinner in  New York . Target: He was speaking with specific reference to Sarah Lacy (left), editor of PandoDaily, who recently wrote about deleting her Uber app (right) after the firm teamed up with an apparent escort service in France . A chorus of disapproval aimed at Michael prompted a humiliating public apology to Sarah Lacy, the editor of PandoDaily, in which he disowned the idea entirely. Michael posted an apology to Lacy's Twitter account, saying: 'I would like to apologize to you directly. My comments were wrong and I deeply regret them. 'Neither me [sic] nor my company would ever engage in such activities. Again, I apologize.' The remarks will do little to improve Uber's fragile relationship with the media following the portrayal of its management team as insensitive and aggressive toward customer complaints. And, indeed, the apology did not stop Lacy from writing a scathing opinion piece on PandoDaily, in which she said the plan was 'like a five-year-old pretending to be Frank Underwood' - a reference to Kevin Spacey's scheming politician character in Netflix series House of Cards. According to Lacy, Michael also called her cell phone and ask to speak in private, but hung up after she refused to have an off-the-record conversation. The dinner party in question was hosted by Ian Osborne, ex-adviser to British Prime Minister David Cameron and consultant for Uber . Michael's plan came up when he was asked about the firm's negative press coverage. In response, the executive suggested that Uber should consider spending 'a million dollars' of its reported $15billion worth on hiring four researchers and four journalists, according to BuzzFeed. The eight-strong hit team would investigate 'your personal lives, your families' with a view to discrediting journalists behind unfavorable reports on the taxi service, he said. Michael was especially focused on Lacy, who also recently accused Uber of 'sexism and misogyny' on her Silicon Valley website, writing: 'The company simply doesn’t respect us or prioritize our safety.' He reportedly expressed anger over her claims that, responding that women are far more likely to suffer assault at the hands of normal taxi drivers than Uber drivers. He said Lacy should be held 'personally responsible' for any women who copy her and delete the taxi app, and are then sexually assaulted, it is reported . Venue: During the dinner party at Manhattan's Waverly Inn (pictured), Michael was reportedly asked about the firm's depictions in the press. In response, the executive suggested that Uber should consider spending 'a million dollars' of its reported $15billion worth on hiring four researchers and four journalists, it is claimed . Apology: Michael, who used to work at Klout and also sits on a board advising the Department of Defense, later took to Twitter to apologize for his comments to Lacy herself, saying: 'I would like to apologize to you directly' Contradicting his remarks: He added: 'Neither me nor my company would ever engage in such activities' And in reference to a specific claim about Lacy's personal life, he said Uber's dirt-diggers could work covertly to expose and discredit her to others, adding: 'Nobody would know it was us.' After being confronted about his comments, Michael, who has been at Uber for more than a year and was previously described as a 'top deal guy' by founder Travis Kalanick, later apologized . In a statement to BuzzFeed on Monday evening, he said he believed he was speaking off the record and that his remarks did not reflect his nor Uber's views. 'The remarks attributed to me at a private dinner - borne out of frustration during an informal debate over what I feel is sensationalistic media coverage of the company I am proud to work for - do not reflect my actual views and have no relation to the company’s views or approach,' he said. 'They were wrong no matter the circumstance and I regret them.' At no point during the dinner did Michael suggest the firm has already hired opposition researchers. An Uber spokesman confirmed that the company does not carry out such research and has never considered doing it because it would be a 'clear violation of our privacy and data access policies'. The event at Waverly Inn on Friday evening was attended by a number of high-profile figures, including actor Ed Norton and publisher Arianna Huffington.

The event on Friday evening was attended by  actor Ed Norton (left) and publisher Arianna Huffington (right) Response: On Monday, Ms Lacy responded to BuzzFeed's article on her site (pictured), saying: 'Companies shouldn’t be allowed to go to illegal lengths to defame and silence reporters' It comes as a legal battle between Nevada's highly regulated taxi industry and Uber stumbled into complications as two state judges laid claim to hearing the same case. In court on Monday, Clark County District Judge Douglas Herndon blamed the overlap on the state attorney general, who represents the Nevada Taxicab Authority and Nevada Transportation Authority. 'I think you're jumping around to different jurisdictions trying to get a ruling,' he said. The state regulators want to put an end to Uber, which launched its ride-sharing services in Las Vegas, Reno and Carson City on October 24. Hours after the service was launched, the state hastily sought orders to halt the company's business in all three cities. The attorney general later filed a complaint and motions in Washoe County. On Monday, Uber asked the state Supreme Court to put a halt to the  case. The company expects a decision in several days.","Emil Michael, senior vice president, made comments at New York dinner .

"A 130-year-old prison has been converted into a quirky hostel, where travellers can experience a night in the cells. The former military prison, dating back to 1883, is located in Ljubljana, Slovenia and has been converted into a youth hostel, offering a bed for travellers from all around the world. There are 20 cells which guests can stay in and each is completely unique in its design, except they all have their original cell bars on the doors and windows, meaning guests can star in their very own 'prison break.' The hostel, called Hostel Celica, was established in 2003 by the Student Organisation of Ljubljana . Despite the makeover, there is still somewhat of an eerie feel to the prison-turned-hostel in Slovenia . The dining area is totally unrecognisable to the grim conditions prisoners would have suffered back in the day . In addition to the cells there are eight rooms which travellers can stay in, plus a disabled room, and rates start from just £25 a night in a shared room. The hostel, called Hostel Celica, was established in 2003 by the Student Organisation of Ljubljana and has been designed to be bright and quirky- a world away from the prison's former grey decor. Despite its history, the former prison is bright and airy, welcoming guests and inquisitive vistors . The dining area is a good place to make new friends, and left, the hostel has kept many of the existing bars to the cells . You might be able to relax more than you ever thought you would be inside a prison cell, but you might hope a curtain covers the door . The jailhouse was originally used as a military prison of the Austro-Hungarian army but the barracks were demilitarized in 1991 when Slovenia gained independence. The historic building took two years to convert into the hostel it is today, which boasts its own art gallery for travellers to browse. Local and international musicians regularly play gigs in the hostel's bar and restaurant and guests can even enjoy a free, daily guided tour of the local area. The prison back when it was fully functioning - somewhat different to the prison system in the UK . And how the new hostel looks today - taking on a modern look with many windows so as to maximise natural light . Although the size and decor isn't greatly appealing, considering it is a hostel with history, travellers will be attracted . Quirky art has been added to the rooms in the hostel - but have they been extended from original prisoners' etchings? And it's not just travellers seeking a night in the cells who rate the building- Celica was once even voted the number one hippest hostel in the world by travel guide Lonely Planet. Sanja Petrovic, from Hostel Celica, said: 'We are very proud of our unique hostel and its history as a prison and happy to see guest enjoying their time in this historic building.'","130-year-old prison in Ljublijana, Slovenia, converted into 20-cell, 8-room Hostel Celica .

"A new study has revealed that a quarter of ads for luxury goods shown on Facebook are selling counterfeit products. The study was conducted by Italian cyber-security researchers Andrew Stroppa and Agostino Spechhiarello, who analyzed 1,000 ads on Facebook to reach their finding - and urged the social network to do do more to protect consumers. According to Bloomberg, 24per cent of the fashion and luxury ads on Facebook hawk fake goods, even though the social media website claims it is making a conscious effort to try to remove these ads. Scroll down for video . Ray Ban was one of the brand researchers found targeted most, along with Louis Vuitton and Ralph Lauren. One of the fake ads the team found selling Ray Ban sunglasses. Many of the ads were traced back to Chinese websites by the researchers . The global counterfeiting market has reached unprecedented levels. Counterfeit goods now account for nearly 10 percent of worldwide trade, an estimated $500 billion annually, according to the World Customs Organization. According to the pair, 180 of the 1,000 ads were luxury and fashion listings. Ray Bay sunglasses, Louis Vuitton bags, and Ralph Lauren polo shirts were all among the most popular items offered for sale. Of those, 43 were for counterfeit goods, linking to phony websites made to look like the real thing. A picture promoting Ray-Ban sunglasses, for instance, will connect you to a website that features all the same branding, but with slight alterations indicating that it is a fake. The same goes for ads for handbags, designer clothing or accessories. Many of the phony e-commerce sites are registered under Chinese front companies, according to the review. Researchers set up automatic Facebook accounts to activate and gather the specific ads promoted by the social network. Once they had gathered the ads, the team manually analysed each one, to see which pointed to a 'real' supplier and which to a counterfeit firm. Clicking on the ads led consumers to fake sites designed to look exactly like the real thing, the team said. The researchers found sites use a variety of tricks to fool both consumers and Facebook. They including designing sites to look like the 'real' brand, and even choosing domain names that are very similar. 'Facebook should do more, and must do more against this,' they told Mashable. A spokesperson for Facebook told Bloomberg that they go to great lengths to prevent these ads from appearing on the site. 'We prohibit fraudulent or misleading claims or content,' the spokesperson said. Researchers set up automatic Facebook accounts to activate and gather the specific ads promoted by the social network. Once they had gathered the ads, the team manually analysed each one, to see which pointed to a 'real' supplier and which to a counterfeit firm. They then tried to track the sites, finding many were based in China. 'And to enforce our terms and policies, we have invested significant resources in developing a robust advertising review program that includes both automated and manual review of ads.' The researchers also noted that since they started researching the issue, many of the illegitimate ads have been removed. Google also faces similar issues. It removed more than 350 million 'bad ads' in 2013, and almost 220 million in 2012, according to the company's transparency report. In any case, the researchers told Mashable that internet users should be wary of being too open with their credit card details online. 'You do not know where you are going to end up,' they explained. 'In many cases, your credit card is at risk, thanks to obscure payment systems backed by companies you have no idea who they are.'","Over 1,000 ads for luxury brands like Ray Ban were analysed .

"Ray Cole, pictured, was detained by Moroccan authorities after he travelled to the country to meet his Facebook friend Jamal Jam Wald Naas . A British holidaymaker jailed in Morocco for being gay has had the charges he faced formally dropped following his return home to the UK. Ray Cole, 70, was imprisoned for four months with his Moroccan friend Jamal Jam Wald Nass after homosexual images were found on his phone. The pair were left languishing in a crowded Marrakesh jail described as a 'concentration camp', but were eventually granted a conditional release. Now Mr Cole has disclosed that the charges the pair faced have been formally dropped by the Moroccan authorities. In a Facebook message to his supporters, Mr Cole, from Deal, Kent, said they could now 'put this horrible episode behind us'. He added: 'Happy though I am for this, it doesn't take away the memory of the appalling treatment in the police station and the frightening conditions in the prison. 'The overwhelming feeling of fear and isolation will stay with me for the rest of my life, I think. 'Even though I was held for just three weeks, at the time I had no idea of when I would get out and see my loved ones again. It seemed like an eternity, and all for what? Nothing! 'Just because I'm a gay man. And because they could! There are no winners. Morocco's reputation as a safe holiday destination was shattered and inquiries dropped by around 50 per cent, although it will recover. 'And it cost me in the region of £7,000 personally. So that's my travelling days finished! So I'm happy that it's all over, but sorry that the Moroccan authorities haven't yet offered any apology or compensation. 'I'm not holding my breath.' Mr Cole, centre, returned to the UK last month where he was met by his family after his month-long ordeal . Mr Cole, left, was held in a cell along with 59 other men in an area designed just to hold just 44 . Mr Cole's son Adrian, 41, said the family were relieved to have finally gained a resolution and to now put the matter behind them. He said: 'We understand that this is the first time that anyone has had this type of effect on a Muslim society's judicial system.' The case generated huge interest on social media from supporters who urged the Moroccan authorities to free retired Mr Cole. As well as a petition, a Free Ray Cole hashtag circulated on Twitter and a Facebook page was set up calling for the release of Mr Cole, who has a minor heart condition. He struck up a friendship with Mr Nass, who is in his 20s, on Facebook. It was on Mr Cole's second visit to Morocco to see him that they were detained at a bus stop by officers. Mr Cole was four weeks into a five-week break in the north African country when the pair were held on September 18. Mr Cole and Mr Nass, were held for three weeks in the central prison in Marrakesh, pictured . Confusion initially reigned over where he was being held until he was eventually tracked down. On October 2 his family received a phone call telling them the pair had been jailed for four months. They had feared a six-month jail term as a worst-case scenario. He was kept in a cell intended for 44 men which was holding 60, forcing Mr Cole to sleep on the ground and live with dangerous prisoners. The Foreign Office website says homosexuality is a criminal offence in Morocco. It states: 'Sexual relations outside marriage are also punishable by law.' But Mr Cole's local MP, Conservative Charlie Elphicke, described the charges as 'medieval' and said it showed British tourists were not safe in Morocco. Former deputy speaker of the House of Commons Nigel Evans also attacked the 'archaic' law that sent Mr Cole to prison.","Ray Cole was in the final week of his trip to Morocco when he was jailed .

"Loud-mouthed rocker Gene Simmons has profusely apologised for his outrageous remarks about people battling with mental health and has even deleted his Twitter account following a serious backlash from fans across the globe. The outspoken KISS bass guitarist made the insensitive remarks, which prompted radio stations around the world to boycott the band’s music, just two weeks before tweeting his condolences about the suicide of comedian Robin Williams. Simmons publicly apologised on both his Twitter and Facebook accounts after social media users reacted with disgust about the musician’s astounding rant which included the harsh words: ‘F***you, then kill yourself’ when talking about people who suffer from depression and addictions. But the damage was already done as far as many of his dedicated fans were concerned and Simmons has since deleted his Twitter account which he used on a daily basis. Scroll down for video . Gene Simmons told people who battled with depression: ‘F***you, then kill yourself’ Simmons' public apology on his Facebook page which was also posted on his Twitter account but he has deleted it since . Australia's Triple M radio station, Canadian stations Power97 and BobFM and New York's longtime WPYX DJ Uncle Vito all led boycotts of KISS music in the wake of Simmons' comments. Simmons said he would not defend his tirade by listing the ‘myriad of charities and self-help organisations I am involved with.’ 'Rather, I simply want to be clear that my heart goes out to anyone suffering from depression. Unkind statements about depression was certainly never my intention,' he posted. 'I was wrong and in the spur of the moment made remarks that in hindsight were made without regard for those who truly suffer the struggles of depression.' He added that although he had never sugarcoated his feelings regarding drug use and alcoholics, his words were never meant to be misconstrued as 'vile commentary'. The comments are a complete about-turn to the shocking remarks made in an interview when asked if he still got along with the original band members. ‘No, I don't get along with anybody who's a drug addict and has a dark cloud over their head and sees themselves as a victim,’ Simmons said to music website Songfacts. KISS fans express their disgust on Twitter about Simmons' explosive comments . The majority of fans expressed on Facebook that they don't perceive Simmons' apology as genuine . The outspoken rocker commented that drug addicts and alcoholics always have the attitude of ‘the world is a harsh place.’ ‘My mother was in a concentration camp in Nazi Germany. I don't want to hear f*** all about ""the world as a harsh place. She gets up every day, smells the roses and loves life. And for a putz, 20-year-old kid to say, ""I'm depressed, I live in Seattle."" F*** you, then kill yourself.’ 'I never understand, because I always call them on their bluff. I'm the guy who says 'Jump!' when there's a guy on top of a building who says, ""That's it, I can't take it anymore, I'm going to jump."" Simmons then went on to imply that people with suicidal tendencies were attention seekers. ‘Are you kidding? Why are you announcing it? Shut the f*** up, have some dignity and jump! You've got the crowd. ‘ . ‘By the way, you walk up to the same guy on a ledge who threatens to jump and put a gun to his head, ""I'm going to blow your f***in' head off!"" He'll go, ""Please don't!"" It's true. He's not that insane.’ Triple M radio station has banned playing KISS music with network head Mike Fitzpatrick describing Simmons (second from right) as a 'd***head' Despite having an army of lifelong fans many have turned their back on the rocker with the majority of more than 2,500 fans posting comments on Simmons’ Facebook post saying they don't accept that his apology was from the heart. 'Sorry but this is damage control to me!!!!Not sincere at all,' Shelley Marshall posted. 'Too bad you don't mean it, sounds like a ""pr"" statement, your just trying to cover your a** due to the backlash, my days to being a kiss fan are over due to your ignorance,' Mike Foreman said. Simmons' explosive comments also prompted the Triple M radio station to pull all KISS tracks from playlists across the country. Triple M's Network head Mike Fitzpatrick described Simmons’ comments as ‘misguided and insensitive’ and called on other stations to also boycott the rock band’s music. ‘Depression and suicide are not topics he should be using to further his notoriety or sell records.' 'His desperation to use mental health issues to find relevancy in a modern age is sickening. I can only put it down to a brain fade on his part,’ Fitzpatrick said on the station’s website. ‘The Triple M Network can’t and won’t be playing or supporting this d***head’s music. I put the challenge out to other stations across Australia and North America to also drop any of this nudnik's songs until such time as he reconsiders his thoughtless and insensitive position.’ Simmons expressed empathy for Robin William's tragic death on Twitter just two weeks after his outrageous remarks . Nikki Six condemns Simmons' comments . Mötley Crüe bassist Nikki Sixx also expressed his disgust in Simmons comments on his Sixx Sense radio show, Rolling Stone reported. 'It's pretty moronic because [Simmons] thinks everybody listens to him, that he is the God of Thunder. He will tell you he is the greatest man on earth, and to be honest with you, I like Gene. But in this situation, I don't like Gene. I don’t like Gene's words,' Sixx said. 'There is a 20-year-old kid out there who is a Kiss fan and reads this and goes, ""You know what? He's right. I should just kill myself."" Sixx added that there were many other options for people who are depressed than to take their own lives. 'And I don't want people to listen to an interview from a rock star, who's telling you the only way out is out.' Simmons’ extreme comments were published just two weeks before he expressed his sympathy on Twitter on Tuesday about the tragic death of actor Robin Williams on Tuesday who battled with depression and drug and alcohol issues. ‘R.I.P. Robin Williams. A kind and generous man.’ He also retweeted a National  Suicide Prevention hotline tweet honouring Williams.

Former education minister Tim Loughton appeared to join in, prompting colleagues seated on adjacent benches to collapse in laughter. Health Minister Anna Soubry was also seen scratching at the air, and Government whip Anne Milton joined in the merriment but then leant across to pat Mr Simpson on the arm and advise him to stop. The joke appeared to be directed at Mrs Gillan’s choice of clothes, but also reflected colleagues’ boredom with her focus on the Government’s HS2 project.

However Mrs Gillan’s office said she had been aware of what was going on behind her but was ‘not particularly bothered’. Mr Simpson’s boss, Mr Hague, had to apologise last week after being seen to mutter ‘stupid woman’ at a Labour MP who raised questions about donations to his office.

"The owner of the Nazi-themed Soldatenkaffee in Bandung, West Java, is being questioned by authorities over whether he is trying to incite racial hatred . A restaurant owner in Indonesia whose Nazi-themed cafe is covered with Hitler memorabilia and staffed by waiters in Waffen-SS military uniforms is to be questioned by authorities. Soldatenkaffee in the West Java provincial capital of Bandung has sparked outrage amongst tourists and locals for its red wall of Nazi-related memorabilia, including a large flag with swastika and a giant picture of Adolf Hitler. Despite being open since April 2011, a recent article about its German fascist theme in a local English-language newspaper has prompted angry criticisms on social networking sites. Now the deputy mayor of the popular tourist town has written to cafe owner Henry Mulyana summoning him to discuss his motives for opening the cafe and whether his objective was to incite racial hatred. Ayi Vivananda said: 'Those symbols are internationally recognized to represent violence and racism.' Mr Mulyana says he simply intended to attract business to his restaurant, and denies wanting to breed hatred. He also denied being pro-Nazi or supporting Hitler, responsible for the deaths of some 6 million Jews during World War II. He said: 'I'm just a businessman, not a politician. 'I have a right to design my restaurant with anything that attracts people to come. I'm sure that I'm not violating any laws.' He said the recent controversy had . forced him to temporarily close his restaurant, but did not say whether . he would consider changing the Nazi theme if authorities requested him . to do so.

"Teacher: Michael Adebolajo's brother Jeremiah, pictured, was paid thousands by MI6 to become a spy in the Middle East . The younger brother of one of the men accused of murdering Drummer Lee Rigby was paid thousands of pounds by MI6 as part of spying operations in the Middle East, The Mail on Sunday has discovered. Jeremiah Adebolajo, who uses the name Abul Jaleel, was also asked to help ‘turn’ his brother, Michael, to work for MI5, who were already aware of Michael’s close links to extremist groups. The claims are made by the Adebolajo family and a well-placed source who contacted The Mail on Sunday. Jeremiah Adebolajo, 26, who works as an English teacher at a  university in Saudi Arabia and returned to Britain this week, is to be questioned about his brother by Scotland Yard counter-terrorism detectives today. Government sources have already confirmed that Michael Adebolajo was known to MI5. Last week it was alleged that he rebuffed efforts by the security service to recruit him as a spy. Michael, 28, was discharged from hospital on Friday and was yesterday charged with the murder of Drummer Rigby and attempted murder of two police officers on May 22 in Woolwich, South London. Now it has emerged that MI5’s  sister agency, MI6, had targeted Jeremiah, a married teacher based at the University of Ha’il. MI5 and MI6 work closely together on counter-terrorism operations. MI5 focuses on home security, while MI6 targets threats from overseas. A document seen by The Mail on Sunday details concerns raised by Jeremiah’s family about MI6’s alleged harassment in April last year. In it, Jeremiah’s sister, Blessing Adebolajo, 32, who works as a human resources assistant in London, says her brother was approached by MI6 while he was working at the University of Ha’il – an important strategic location in the Middle East because it takes only one hour by plane to reach 11 Arab capitals. Workplace: Jeremiah Adeboljao was working at the University of Ha'il in Saudi Arabia when he was approached by MI6 . Complaint: A redacted copy of the allegations made by the Adebolajo family about the approaches made by the security services. Jeremiah said this account as untrue . A friend of Jeremiah has confirmed her account. The friend said: ‘They asked him about Michael and asked him to help “turn” him to work for MI5. ‘They also told him to go to certain hotels, order a cup of tea and wait for his contact. ‘On these occasions he was handed £300, and was paid to fly first-class and stay in five-star hotels.’ The document, prepared by case workers with the charity Cageprisoners, says Blessing approached the East London charity for help because she was worried about the harassment and intimidation of both her brothers by the security and intelligence services. She says MI6 bought a ticket so Jeremiah could fly to an Intercontinental hotel in another Middle East country (believed to be the United Arab Emirates) and that he was given local currency worth more than £1,000. She also alleges Jeremiah told her that he was interrogated about specific people and was shown pictures of himself with named individuals taken in the UK. But Blessing told Cageprisoners that Jeremiah had ‘strongly’ rejected MI6’s offer to work as one of their agents. Older sister: Blessing Adebolajo had allegedly said her brother Jeremiah was approached by MI6 and asked to become an informant . As a result of this rejection, his sister says he was ‘intimidated’ until he was finally told that he would be stopped from leaving the UK. The friend said that two years ago Jeremiah was approached by UK security officers when he was held at Heathrow on his way back from Saudi Arabia. During the interview, he was warned about what happens to Muslims who don’t help the Government and was shown documents that confirmed people he knew were being held in prisons throughout the world. Police and security services are under huge pressure to explain what they know about Adebolajo and his alleged accomplice, Michael Adebowale. Despite warnings stretching back ten years, Michael Adebolajo is said to have been considered ‘low risk’ by MI5. He was photographed at high-profile protests – even standing next to hate preacher Anjem Choudary. He was arrested in Kenyan 2010 over his alleged plans to travel to Somalia to join terror group Al-Shabaab before being returned to the UK. Jeremiah married Charlotte Patricia Taylor in 2008 at Sutton Register Office in Surrey. Shortly afterwards the couple are believed to have left for Saudi Arabia where Jeremiah found work teaching. The University of Ha’il is one of Saudi Arabia’s most progressive education establishments and was established by Royal Decree in 2005. It consists of five colleges – Sciences, Medicine and Medical Sciences,  Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering, and a Community College – and has more than 16,000 students.

"Hunter Marr died on January 6 after suffering from breathing difficulties . The parents of a nine-year-old boy, who died only 16 hours after being released from hospital, have said they hope the coronial inquest into their son's death will bring those responsible to justice. Hunter Marr, from Ormeau in Queensland, died after suffering a suspected asthma attack on January 6. His father, Matthew, told Daily Mail Australia that he will attend every day of the week long coronial inquest into Hunter's death, which begins on Friday. 'I won't rest until the people that should be brought to account, are held to account,' Mr Marr said. 'I'm going every day. I'm going to look them in the eye.' 'The one thing we most want is for the people who should have done their job to be brought to justice - that's what Hunter deserves; he was an innocent boy.' The father-of-three's son passed away after spending three nights in the Mater Children's Hospital in Brisbane's south. 'He wasn't breathing properly, he was struggling to breathe and he was very, very pale,' Mr Marr said. 'This happened on the Thursday, he went into hospital in the night time and by Sunday they were talking about discharging him. The nine-year-old's father Matthew (centre) said he 'won't rest until the people that should be brought to account [over his son's death] are held to account' He said he can vividly remember the moment his wife, Michelle (pictured with Hunter) screamed as their son passed out only 16 hours after being discharged from hospital . 'They said they won't discharge him until we get the test results back, but they discharged him anyway. 16 hours later, he died.' 'I couldn't believe it,' Mr Marr said of the moment his son was discharged. He said he could vividly recall the moment that his wife Michelle, woke him up to tell him their son was struggling to breathe on the day he died. 'I went out to call the ambulance and he passed out on the couch and Michelle just screamed. 'I dream it every night. By the time triple zero had answered, I had him on the floor and had started CPR.' 'He was a comedian. He was a card,' Mr Marr said of Hunter, before adding: 'His birthday was on October 20, He would have been 10. That was the single most hardest day since he died' Mr Marr said that it took the ambulance 20 minutes to arrive at their family home before paramedics took over applying CPR and transported the nine-year-old to hospital, where he was pronounced dead. More than 10 months after Hunter's death, a coroner's inquest will look into  what caused his death as well as the circumstances leading up to the death and the appropriateness of the health services provided by the Mater Children's Hospital and Queensland ambulance service. 'He was a comedian. He was a card,' Mr Marr said of Hunter, before adding: 'his birthday was on October 20. He would have been 10; that was the single most hardest day since he died. 'He's such a beautiful boy, I don't know anybody that wouldn't warm to him. He was a good kid, very humble. 'The inquest will look at perhaps what could be done differently and if there are people accountable for his death. I personally believe there are people accountable,' Mr Marr said.

"Tens of millions of pounds are being spent every year by the NHS on cosmetic surgery, figures reveal. Taxpayers are forking out vast and growing sums for facelifts, nose jobs, liposuction and breast augmentation – at a time when patients are being denied life-saving cancer drugs. The number of facelifts and operations to increase breast size have more than doubled over the past decade, while there has been a 40 per cent rise in liposuction. Tens of millions of pounds are being spent every year by the NHS on cosmetic surgery, figures reveal. Barman Sam Barton (above), 22, of Sutton Coldfield, in the West Midlands, was given a nose job by the NHS – and boasted how easy it was to get the £5,000 procedure . Despite a looming financial crisis, the NHS in 2012/13 found the money to carry out 1,137 facelifts – costing taxpayers up to £8.5million. Up to £52.5million went on breast enlargements and a record £10million was spent on liposuction. Every week there are now 164 nose jobs, 37 liposuction procedures, 22 facelifts and 273 boob jobs being carried out on the cash-strapped Health Service. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt recently said the NHS should only fund cosmetic surgery when there is a clear clinical need and if someone’s physical and mental health could be at risk without it. But the dramatic rise in some forms of surgery indicates that such assurances are not always sought. Surgeons say hospitals are being put under pressure to bend the rules under pressure from patients demanding purely cosmetic work. Earlier this year a survey found that a quarter of patients who have has cosmetic procedures on the NHS had lied to secure funding. Many claimed to have low self-esteem or depression as a result of the way they looked, according to research by a firm of medical negligence solicitors. The figures, from the Health and Social Care Information Centre, do not break down the reasons for the operations – and whether there was the sort of clinical need that Mr Hunt was talking about.Earlier this year a survey found that a quarter of patients who have had cosmetic procedures on the NHS had lied to secure funding. Many claimed to have low self-esteem or depression as a result of the way they looked, according to research by a firm of medical negligence solicitors. Figures obtained by the Mail show the NHS in 2012/13 carried out 1,137 facelifts – up 111 per cent in a decade. Facelifts cost private patients between £4,000 and £7,500 each, according to the NHS Choices website, meaning that up to £8.5million was spent on the operations in 2012/13. Josie Cunningham had an enlargement after saying her 32A chest was ruining her life. After becoming unhappy with her new 36DD figure, the Leeds modelling hopeful had a breast reduction on the NHS . The number of breast enlargements has soared by 145 per cent in a decade to 10,504 – costing up to £52.5million. Many of these will be reconstructions following cancer treatment, but the increase far outstrips any rise in breast cancer diagnoses. In one case, Josie Cunningham had an enlargement after saying her 32A chest was ruining her life. After becoming unhappy with her resulting 36DD figure, the modelling hopeful from Leeds had a breast reduction on the NHS too. And barman Sam Barton, 22, of Sutton Coldfield, in the West Midlands, was given a nose job by the NHS – and boasted how easy it was to get the £5,000 procedure. He now says he expects the taxpayer to foot the bill for further surgery, including another nose job, as well as having his ears pinned back and jaw reshaped. The obesity epidemic has also had an effect on the surgery bill, with the number of liposuction operations in 2012/13 standing at 1,926 – up 40 per cent in ten years. The cost in the most recent year will have been up to £9.6million, according to NHS Choices which says the operation costs between £1,500 and £5,000. There has also been a 39 per cent rise in the number undergoing eyelid surgery to 4,966 – costing up to £19.9million. This operation is supposed to be carried out to treat affected vision. And 8,537 nose jobs were carried out in 2013/14 – up 4 per cent and costing £34.1million. Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It’s ludicrous the NHS pays for procedures that are not based on strict medical needs.’ The figures were compiled by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, following a request from the Daily Mail. It also showed that up to £20.3million was spent on breast reduction operations, £5.8million on tummy tucks and £5.7million on ear pinning. However, these totals have declined over the past decade. Last month Mr Hunt told a Westminster lunch: ‘We should not be doing cosmetic work on the NHS.’ Roger Goss, of pressure group Patient Concern, said: ‘There are two types of cosmetic surgery – the type that happens after illness and the sort where someone is just trying to look better. 'We agree with the Secretary of State that this kind of thing is no longer affordable on the NHS. In fact, it is amazing it was ever considered affordable at all.’ NHS facing £30bn funding black hole that'll hit 'absolutely vital services' with 'dire' consequences for patients, warns minister . By JAMES CHAPMAN . Health minister Norman Lamb has warned of a looming £30billion-a-year black hole in the Health Service’s finances . The NHS is about to run out of cash and ‘absolutely vital services’ will have to be slashed unless billions can be saved, a health minister has claimed. In a recording obtained by the Daily Mail, Norman Lamb warned of a looming £30billion-a-year black hole in the Health Service’s finances. By 2021, he said, the scale of the funding gap threatens ‘dire’ consequences for patients. It is the first time a minister at the Department for Health has admitted the financial problems facing the NHS. Speaking at the Orange Book Conference – a Liberal Democrat event held last month – Mr Lamb, minister of state at the Department of Health, said that the NHS faces a ‘funding gap of £30billion per year’ which austerity measures meant the Government would not be able to fill. ‘If you take health…by 2021 if things carry on as they are, there is a funding gap of £30billion, £30billion per year, and so to be in the position to suddenly find vast amounts of extra money to throw at service, and given the state of public finances and indeed the changing ratio of people of working age to people who aren’t, quite dramatic in our society, that seems to be an unlikely prospect,’ he said. ‘The potential consequences of the status quo are that across the country you lose absolutely vital services which people rely on, and for me the consequences of that are too dire to contemplate. ‘So there is an absolute imperative that we think about how we get a better value from public services.’ NHS England has warned that within the next few years the service is ‘about to run out of cash in a very serious fashion’. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt denied there is any existing black hole in the NHS, and insisted the Government is making savings to contend with increasing demand for services. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt denied there is any existing black hole in the NHS, and insisted the Government is making savings to contend with increasing demand for services . Asked if he would have to request a bailout from Chancellor George Osborne, Mr Hunt told Radio 4’s Today: ‘No, and I think it is wrong to describe it as a black hole. ‘Every year, because of an ageing population, we have additional demand for services and we have to make efficiency savings. Over this Parliament, we have found about £20billion of efficiency savings which we are investing in more doctors and nurses on the front line. ‘And every year we have a challenge in the NHS to find those efficiency savings. ‘We have had a very difficult few years as a country but every family up and down the country has learned to live within its budget, and we too must live within our budget in the NHS. We are doing that and I’m sure we will continue to do that.’ Some members of Labour’s Shadow Cabinet want the party to commit to increasing National Insurance by a penny to pay for extra NHS spending. The rise would replicate Gordon Brown’s 1 per cent rise, which was introduced in the 2002 Budget to increase investment in the Health Service. David Cameron told MPs this week that for the first time, the independent Commonwealth Fund had ranked the UK’s Health Service as the best in the world. ‘It has happened only under this Government,’ he said. But Shadow Cabinet Office minister Jonathan Ashworth said: ‘You can’t trust the Tories with the NHS. ‘Despite hubristic claims to the contrary, we now know there is a crisis, and it’s due to the bad decisions and botched reforms David Cameron has made.’","Comes at a time when patients are being denied life-saving cancer drugs .

"Labour's chances of regaining power are under serious threat from looming ‘annihilation’ by the SNP in Scotland and an unprecedented surge by the Greens in the rest of the country, polls suggested yesterday. A Survation survey suggested Labour are set to lose all but five of their 40 MPs in their traditional Scottish stronghold in May’s general election. It also showed that just two per cent of Scots say they completely trust Ed Miliband – far less than the 24 per cent who professed belief in the Loch Ness monster in a separate poll conducted in 2012. Scroll down for video . Only two per cent of Scots say they completely trust Labour leader Ed Miliband (picture), a survey revealed . The latest figures, a record lead for the SNP, would dramatically reduce Labour’s tartan army of MPs, jeopardising Mr Miliband’s chances of becoming the next prime minister. It would also put the SNP in a position to determine who should form the next Westminster government, either by entering a coalition or offering to support a minority government. Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond, addressing the Holyrood parliament for the final time before bowing out, dropped his heaviest hint to date that he intends to return to Westminster. Mr Salmond, who was last week replaced as leader of the SNP by his former deputy Nicola Sturgeon, said it had been the ‘privilege’ of a lifetime to serve in the post he has held since 2007. In a nod to growing speculation that he is planning to be a key figure in Westminster in another hung Parliament, he said: ‘I have absolutely no idea if my experience of minority government in this place will come in handy in another place.’ The Scottish survey confirmed recent polls showing an extraordinary surge for the SNP in the aftermath of its defeat in September’s independence referendum. A separate poll conducted in 2012 found that 24 per cent of people professed belief in the Loch Ness monster . It put support for the party for next year’s general election at 46 per cent, compared with 24 per cent support for Labour. The Conservatives were on 17 per cent and Liberal Democrats six. The SNP said it was the largest lead for the party in Westminster that Survation has ever recorded. Those who would lose their seat include Jim Murphy, who is standing to be the next leader of Scottish Labour and Labour’s election campaign chief Douglas Alexander. SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson said: ‘This is enormously encouraging. It reflects all recent surveys in underlining the strength of the SNP vote, and is a further demonstration that Labour and the other Westminster parties are facing a major backlash in Scotland. ‘With a majority of people in Scotland saying that they distrust Ed Miliband, David Cameron and Nick Clegg, this poll is a disaster for all three Westminster parties. ‘We take absolutely nothing for granted, and know there is a huge amount of hard work to be done in the weeks and months ahead - but there is no doubt that the SNP have momentum going into next year’s Westminster election. ‘These record leads for the SNP reflect the fact that people are putting their trust in the SNP to stand up for Scotland, and ensure that the ‘extensive new powers’ we were promised by the Westminster parties in the referendum are delivered.’ Those who would lose their seat include Jim Murphy, who is standing to be the next leader of Scottish Labour and Labour’s election campaign chief Douglas Alexander. Separately, a YouGov poll across the UK put the Greens on a record high of eight per cent – suggesting it is eating into the disaffected former Liberal Democrat supporters who Labour had been banking on for victory.","Only two per cent of Scots say they completely trust Labour's Ed Miliband .

"Bradford West MP George Galloway said Israel was an 'illegal, barbarous, savage state' Controversial  MP George Galloway today vowed not to be 'silenced' after he was interviewed under caution by police for publicly declaring Bradford an ‘Israel-free zone’ in protest at the war in Gaza. Speaking in Leeds earlier this month, the veteran Left-wing firebrand said Israelis were no longer welcome in the city where he has a constituency. The remarks sparked outrage and hundreds of complaints to  West Yorkshire Police. Mr Galloway today lashed out at the police's decision to question him over the speech. He said: 'This is an absolute and despicable attempt to curb my freedom of speech by people who appear to be quite happy about the indiscriminate murder of Palestinians in Gaza.' Mr Galloway added: 'I won't be silenced, I will keep speaking out against horrendous injustice.' The police probe was sparked after Mr Galloway made a speech in Leeds in front of a Palestinian flag, lashing out at Israel's policies in Gaza. In one part of his speech, Mr Galloway said: ‘We have declared Bradford an Israel-free zone. ‘We don’t want any Israeli goods. We don’t want any Israeli services. We don’t want any Israeli academics coming to the university or college. ‘We don’t even want any Israeli tourists to come to Bradford even if any of them had thought of doing so. ‘We reject this illegal, barbarous, savage state that calls itself Israel. And you have to do the same.’ The row escalated on Monday after Daniel Taub, Israel's ambassador to the UK, visited Bradford and held meetings with local Jews and prominent councillors. During his visit Mr Taub said: 'In the best spirit of Yorkshire, the real voice of Bradford knows that there has only ever been one good boycott – and that's Geoff Boycott.' Scroll down for video . He also tweeted a picture of himself holding an Israeli passport outside city hall and another with an Israeli flag in the Greengates area of the city. The move was described as a 'deliberate provocation' by Zulfi Karim, secretary of the Bradford Council of Mosques. Mr Karim said on Tuesday: 'For an ambassador to unfurl an Israeli flag by a Welcome To Bradford sign is a deliberate provocation and not the behaviour I would expect of an ambassador of one of the world's most important countries.' Israeli Ambassador to Britain Daniel Taub, shaking hands with David Cameron during a ceremony remembering athletes killed during the Munich Olympics in 1972, visited Bradford on Monday after George Galloway declared it an Israel-free zone . Mr Galloway has now been interviewed and the Crown Prosecution Service will decide whether any charges should follow. The District Commander for Leeds, Chief Superintendent Paul Money, said: ‘A 59-year-old man has been interviewed under caution voluntarily following complaints made about the content of a speech given in Leeds earlier this month. ‘Once enquiries are completed the matter will be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service for their consideration.’ Mr Galloway won a landslide victory in a byelection in the Bradford West constituency in 2012, which he dubbed the Bradford Spring.","Bradford West MP  interviewed under caution by police over remarks .

"William Hague apologised yesterday after calling a Labour MP a ‘stupid woman’ during Prime Minister’s Questions. The Foreign Secretary muttered the insult twice and shook his head at Cathy Jamieson as she questioned David Cameron over Mr Hague’s lobbying on behalf of a Tory party donor. Miss Jamieson’s question centred on previous suggestions that Mr Hague called Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni to ask him to let British firm Tullow Oil off a £200million capital gains tax bill, which the firm claimed had been unfairly charged.

"A man has been arrested and charged in connection with a midday jewelry store robbery at Watch Standard Jewelry in New York City's Diamond District. Rondu Frisby was charged early Tuesday with robbery and criminal possession of a controlled substance. Police say the 37-year-old was an acquaintance of the jewelry store's owner, who has been identified by local media as Daniel Mikhaylov. It wasn't clear if Frisby had a lawyer. Where is he? 58-year-old Leon Fenner, pictured, was still being sought in connection with the Veterans Day robbery in the Diamond District. Meanwhile, Rondu Frisby was charged Tuesday . Alleged robbers: Police say one suspect entered the store, pulled out a gun and grabbed jewelry while another suspect waited in the hallway as lookout. They released surveillance video showing two men on the street . Sources told The New York Post that Frisby worked occasionally for the store, and that he had been questioned due to buzzing a man inside who committed the theft and earlier feigned he was a courier. Police say one suspect entered the eighth-floor Watch Standard Jewelry store, pulled out a gun and grabbed jewelry while another suspect waited in the hallway as lookout. Frisby was at the Watch Jewelry Store for five minutes before the theft, Mikhaylov revealed to The Post. 'Rondu’s not my employee, I want to make that clear,' Mikhaylov told the newspaper. 'He is a person that comes by once in a while, like a friend. He started out as a customer who’d buy gifts for his girlfriend.' Mikhaylov's father Boris - who is one of the store's co-owners - was pistol whipped during the brazen midtown Manhattan heist last Tuesday as the Veterans Day Parade marched nearby.

Investigation: Rondu Frisby was been arrested and charged in connection with the jewelry store robbery . Boris Mikhaylov was forced to empty the contents of a safe - and about a half million dollars in jewelry was taken. Daniel Mikhaylov told The Post '[There was a] gun pointed at my sister’s face. My father got hit in the head. It’s family. 'My dad’s still walking around with a big bump on his head.' Last week a man who claimed to work in the same building where the robbery was committed, Tony Jabaly, told The Wall Street Journal 'When we came out [police] were treating the situation like there were hostages in the building. They were pointing their guns at us as we went down the stairs.' 58-year-old Leon Fenner was still being sought in connection with the robbery, and it is not known who the third man is.","Rondu Frisby, 37, was arrested and charged in connection with the midday robbery at Watch Standard Jewelry on Veterans Day .

"Alice Lee, the sister of the famous To Kill A Mockingbird author and an influential Alabama lawyer and church leader in her own right, has died. Miss Alice, as she was known, died on Monday according to an online notice posted by Johnson Funeral Home in Monroeville, the south Alabama home of Alice and Harper Lee. No cause of death was given, and the announcement said arrangements are as yet incomplete. Alice Lee, the sister of the famous To Kill A Mockingbird author and an influential Alabama lawyer and church leader in her own right, has died at the age of 103 in Monroeville, Alabama . Alice Lee's younger sister Harper, left, wrote the novel To Kill A Mockingbird. It was released in 1960 and won the Pulitzer Prize . Lee was 103 and had practiced law until just a few years ago. For a time she was Alabama's oldest practicing attorney. She was also active for years as a leader in the United Methodist Church in south Alabama, which has an award named in her honor. Though her younger sister famously stopped granting interviews in 1964, Alice Lee spoke to PBS about five years ago for a documentary about her famous sibling. Miss Alice was already 15 years old when her sister Harper Nelle was born. Throughout her life she helped guard the privacy of her sister, who in 1961 won the Pulitzer Prize for her novel about racial injustice in the South. Harper drew back from the public eye in the 1960s because ‘as time went on, she said reporters began taking too many liberties with what she said,’ said Miss Alice in the documentary. Until a few years ago Alice Lee had practiced law and had been Alabama's oldest practicing attorney . During her many years as a lawyer, Miss Alice's office was located on the upper floor of the Monroeville bank where the original manuscript of her sister’s famed novel was locked in the vaults. In the PBS documentary, called Hey Boo, she said there was no one secret in particular to her longevity – only that she lived ‘day by day’ and ‘doesn’t do anything to bring on dying.’ At the time of the interview, Miss Alice was 98 and nearly deaf. Even so, she told of her young life in Alabama, and how the Great Depression delayed her slightly when becoming a lawyer. Her father encouraged her to join his firm after she passed the bar in 1943. She asked how a woman would be received in a small law office, to which her father responded: ‘You never know until you try.’ Harper Lee, was awarded the Medal of Freedom by President George W Bush in  2007, but soon after suffered a stroke that has left her in a wheelchair and partially paralyzed . Harper Lee's lone published novel, released in 1960, tells the story of small-town lawyer Atticus Finch, his two children and the struggle against racial prejudice and injustice in the Jim Crow South. The book details the goings on in the fictitious sleepy town of Maycomb, Alabama between 1932 and 1935. It is told through the eyes of Jean Louise ‘Scout’ Finch, who is a knowledgeable six-year-old tomboy who has the mind of a child but the understanding of an adult. Among other things, the story details the trial of a black man accused of rape by a white woman. Scout’s father, Atticus Finch, represented Tom Robinson, a 25-year-old farm worker. Though Tom was obviously innocent, he was convicted by the all-white jury and was shot dead while trying to escape from prison. The 1962 movie adaptation of To Kill A Mockingbird starred Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch and Brock Peters as Tom Robinson. It won three Academy Awards . The novel is considered an American classic and is often taught in schools, teaching students important lessons about race, prejudice, misrepresentation, and the loss of childhood. Ironically, winning the Pulitzer caused the friendship between Harper and famous writer Truman Capote to deteriorate. Capote, it was said, was the model for Charles Baker ‘Dill’ Harris, the best friend of Scout and Jem. Dill spent much of the novel trying to get reclusive Boo Radley out of his house. He was jealous that Harper's work received the ultimate prize, and his did not. The book was also turned into a 1962 movie of the same name, which starred Gregory Peck and Robert Duvall, and which won three Academy Awards. Harper Lee, now 88, suffered a stroke in 2007 which has left her in a wheelchair and partially paralyzed. She lives in Monroeville after years of splitting her time between the town of 28,000 and New York.

"A grandmother was needlessly killed by a rare flesh-eating bug after blundering NHS medics failed to diagnose and operate in time, the High Court has heard. Suzanne Gardner, 60, died only three days after contracting  necrotising fasciitis when she slipped on snow in her driveway and cut her arm. The infection moved up her arms and into her chest,  killing her at Christmas 2010. But the popular receptionist's death could have been avoided if hospital staff had examined her sooner and amputated her arms in time, her family say. Suzanne Gardner (pictured, left, on her 60th birthday and, right, with her grandson Christopher) died after she contracted a rare flesh-eating bug. Her widower, Colin, is now suing an NHS trust for negligence . Despite being in excruciating pain, she was not deemed a top priority when she went to A&E and, by the time she was diagnosed, it was too late. Her widower, Colin, of Blisworth, Northamptonshire, is now suing the NHS over what he says was the  needless death of his wife of 40 years. Given the choice of life or death, the devoted grandmother-of-six would have had no problem agreeing to a double amputation if that had been offered earlier, he said. He said: 'She loved life. Her pride and joy were all her children and grandchildren. She never walked away from problems.' Mrs Gardner, pictured with her grandson William, was left in agony after the fall on her driveway . Mrs Gardner cut her elbow when she fell in 2010, but she put the pain and chills she felt the following day down to a flare-up of arthritis or a cold. Two days later, weeping blisters had begun to develop on her hands and arms and the excruciating pain became too much to bear. She went to A&E at Northampton General Hospital, but despite her presentation, she was not considered a top priority. Delays in examination and diagnosis meant the decision to amputate did not come until the morning of the third day after her fall and even then there was an almost two-hour wait before the operation began. Mr Gardner had time only to wish her good luck and give her a kiss before she was taken away to have her arms amputated. But tragically, the bug had already travelled up past her shoulder, killing vital tissue in her arm and chest. The operation was aborted and Mrs Gardner, who was a receptionist in the village GP's surgery, died that afternoon. The family's barrister, Gerwyn Samuel, said the Northampton General Hospital NHS Trust was negligent in not making her a higher priority case. Casualty staff should have spotted her intense and unremitting pain and had her clinically assessed sooner, he told the judge, Sir David Eady. Such 'severe, significant, unvarying, excruciating pain' – out of proportion with any visible symptoms – is the hallmark of necrotising fasciitis, the court was told. Infection expert Prof Marc Winslet criticised the delay in preparing Mrs Gardner for, and getting her to, surgery. Mrs Gardner was taken to A&E at Northampton General Hospital in 2010 but not treated as a top priority . Had she been diagnosed and operated on earlier, her life would probably have been saved, he said. He told the court: 'There was no reason to delay - time costs lives. Necrotising fasciitis is a rare bacterial infection that affects soft tissue and the tissue binding muscles and organs. It can occur following a cut or surgery when bacteria can enter through weakened skin like a blister. The earliest sign of the bug is people being in severe pain, which seems out of proportion to any external signs of the infection. As it progresses, fever, diarrhoea and vomiting can occur before the person falls unconscious. The skin typically turns a dark violet colour, blister form and the tissue underneath begins to die. Without treatment to remove the affected tissue, the bug will spread rapidly and can result in death. 'In the face of necrotising fasciitis is no place for the faint-hearted, because you have to be decisive in your actions and very aggressive in your management. 'You would explain the life threatening nature of the condition and that time is of the essence. 'You have two choices: you either don't operate, in which case the outcome is inevitable, or you operate immediately, giving the best chance.' In his career, he had never come across a patient who chose to die when given the option of amputation, he told the court. Although its barrister, Tom Gibson, apologised to the family for 'failures and delays' in A&E, the NHS Trust denies liability for Mrs Gardner's death. She presented at the hospital with only 'moderate' pain and so was given the correct priority status, it asserts. The hearing continues.","Suzanne Gardner, 60, slipped and fell on snow on her driveway in 2010 .

"Offensive: ITV reporter Richard Pallot twice referred to black footballers as 'coloured' ITV news producers have been given a reprimand after they allowed a reporter to use the word 'coloured' to describe soccer players and coaches. The word was used during a lunchtime news bulletin on February 26 about Prime Minister David Cameron hosting a summit on tackling racism in sport. Twenty viewers complained to ITV and four to broadcasting watchdog Ofcom after the gaffe on the ITV1 programme. ITV executives quickly apologised on Twitter, edited the word from the news report and removed the word from the report that appeared on the ITV News website. They gave warnings about use of the word to the producer, programme editor and reporter. Now, as a result of this, Ofcom has decided to take no action. It said: 'We noted that ITV recognised the editorial mistake almost immediately after broadcast, and took swift and appropriate action to mitigate the potential for further offence.' The industry watchdog said executives edited the report before it was repeated on the ITV1 Plus One service and apologised in the press, on Twitter and to the viewers that complained to them. It added: 'On balance, and in light of the steps taken by ITV to mitigate this offence, Ofcom therefore considered the matter resolved.' Richard Pallot, who reportedly earns £40,000 a show, said 'coloured' twice during the ITV programme as he talked about racism in the game. 'Football has certainly come a long way since bananas were routinely thrown at coloured players,' Pallot reported. Discrimination claims: David Cameron and John Barnes, right, hold a roundtable discussion at a Downing Street racism summit . 'But one shameful statistic remains - only three of the 92 League clubs employ a black manager, and one of those Keith Curl, was only appointed at Notts County a few days ago. 'The Government are funding a scheme to promote more coloured coaches and are also tackling the issue of homophobia in the sport.' Using the term 'coloured' to refer to black people is considered offensive because it dismisses everyone who is not white as the same. The term was in widespread use in Britain in the 1960s but is now considered racist. The problem is it suggests white people are white and everyone else is 'coloured'. There is no recognition that everyone has their own ethnic origin. Alan Hansen sparked a row by using the term last year on the day that John Terry was charged with racially abusing Anton Ferdinand. He denies the offence . After Mr Pallot used the same term, one Twitter user wrote to ITV: 'When was it okay to use the word coloured? And to make it worse is that you were talking about racism!' An ITV spokesman said: 'The reporter’s use of the term ‘coloured’ was inappropriate and we do not defend its use. 'It was an editorial misjudgement and we apologise to those who were understandably offended by the use of this term.' He said that, although the report had been produced against a tight deadline 'we ccept that this does not excuse the mistake being made ... and understand the careful selection of appropriate language around the issues of race.' It said the report was reviewed before it was transmitted, but the word coloured was not spotted because of 'human error and editorial misjudgement'. The spokesman added: 'The reporter, producer and programme editor have all been made aware of the gravity of the error and the incident will feature in future newsroom compliance training.' Following the blunder David Cameron said in Parliament that there were 'worrying' signs that racism is creeping back into football.","Richard Pallot TWICE called black players 'coloured'

"One in nine British men have paid for sex, according to a new study. And the likeliest to do so are 25 to 34-year-old single men in managerial or professional occupations, and those who have had a high number of partners. The research, published in the journal Sexually Transmitted Infections, revealed that 3.6 per cent of the 6,000 men surveyed admitted visiting prostitutes in the past five years. One in nine British men have paid for sex, pictured is Billie Piper as Belle de Jour in Secret Diary of a Call Girl with a client . Lead scientist Dr Cath Mercer, from University College London, said: ‘The picture that emerges does not necessarily fit the stereotype of the lonely older man. ‘In fact, men who pay for sex are more likely to be young professionals with many unpaid sexual partners. Many report other hedonistic and risky behaviours including heavy drinking and drug taking.’ Men who paid for sex were also more than twice as likely as average men to have been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection in the past five years. Men who used prostitutes made up 15.6 per cent of all reported STI diagnoses in male population. Men who paid for sex were more than twice as likely as average men to have been diagnosed with an STI in the past five years . They also reported an average of 31.6 lifetime sexual partners - more than twice the average for the male population. Dr Mercer said: ‘Men who pay for sex are evidently at high risk of infection, but this does not necessarily mean that the STIs are spread through their paid sex. ‘Instead, we found that these men report engaging in other risky sexual behaviours, such as having concurrent - or overlapping - partners, and so should be considered a core-group for sexual health interventions and services.’ The findings come from the third National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal), conducted between 2010-2012 by researchers from UCL, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and NatCen Social Research. A total of 6,108 men aged 16-74 answered questions about paying for sex in a computer-assisted self-interview. The study focused on men as the proportion of women who reported paying for sex was only around 0.1 per cent. Among men who reported ever having paid for sex, 62.6 per cent had done so outside the UK at least once - most commonly in Europe and Asia. This may be driven by ‘hotspots’ such as Amsterdam and Bangkok, said the researchers. ‘Paying for sex may seem more permissible abroad, at a place removed from the day-to-day lives of most men,’ Dr Mercer added. ‘Paid sex can also be more readily available in certain areas so if men mention to their health professional that they will be travelling to destinations known for sex tourism, and especially those where the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections and HIV is high, then it would be opportunistic to have a conversation about safe sex.’","Men in managerial or professional occupations most likely to pay for sex .

"Oxford Lord Mayor Alan Armitage has today resigned after allegedly making inappropriate remarks to a schoolgirl aged 13 . A disgraced Lord Mayor who allegedly told a 13-year-old schoolgirl she looked 'sexy' when she bent over has today resigned from his post. Liberal Democrat Alan Armitage quit his coveted role as Lord Mayor of Oxford today after being accused of telling the teenager: 'It's sexy when you bend down like that'. The alleged incident happened while the youngster and other members of an under-13s sport team were having their photograph taken with him. The . married father-of-three, who is a city and county councillor, claims he . may have said ‘best if you stand next to me’ and was misheard. Mr Armitage's resignation follows a ruling by the council's standards committee last week that it was 'highly probable' he did make an . ‘inappropriate and disrespectful’ comment. At . a hearing held in secret to protect the girl’s identity, they ruled he . had brought the office of Lord Mayor and the city council into . disrepute. But apart . from being ‘censured’ – effectively, given a telling off – the council took no disciplinary action and allowed him to remain Lord . Mayor. Mr Armitage, who is also a county . councillor for West Central Oxford, said at the time he had no intention . of giving up his position of Lord Mayor. Speaking . after he was censured, he said: 'My county council position is up for . election and I have not yet decided whether to continue and fight it in . May. I have not heard from anyone that I ought to be resigning. 'I . have said all along that I may have said some of the words which are . imputed to me but it is not very likely. I have tried to tell the . truth.' Oxford Lord Mayor Alan Armitage allegedly made the comment to a member of an under-13s sports team at a awards evening. He is pictured with Burmese democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi last June . But the shamed public figure . today announced his decision in an email to his fellow councillors and Oxford . city council's chief executive, Peter Sloman. Despite quitting his role as Lord Mayor, it is understood he has not left his post as a councillor. Current deputy mayor Mohammed Abbasi will step into the role temporarily until the completion of the Mayoral year in May. His comments were branded 'absolutely . unacceptable' by the chairman of Oxford's Liberal Democrats. Following the decision to censure Mr . Armitage, Tony De Vere, chairman of Oxford West and Abingdon Liberal . Democrats, said: 'Such behaviour is absolutely unacceptable and this is a . matter the Liberal Democrats take extremely seriously. 'We have started the process of seeking appropriate disciplinary action.' Rap: Oxford City Council's Standards Committee called the alleged comment 'highly inappropriate' The investigation began after a . parent complained to the girl’s school about the incident in June last . year, a month after Mr Armitage began his year in office as Lord Mayor. The . school passed it to Oxfordshire County Council’s child protection team, . which found Mr Armitage was not a risk to youngsters. But it did pass its findings to Oxford City Council to see if its code of conduct had been breached. There were differing accounts of what Mr Armitage was alleged to have said. They . included: ‘It’s sexy when you bend down like that’; ‘bending is very . sexy, isn’t it?’; and ‘ooh, that’s a bit sexy’. It is understood the . girl and up to five witnesses gave evidence about the alleged offending . comment. Mr Armitage . denied the allegation.

"Pope Francis yesterday moved a British woman closer to sainthood for the second time in less than a month. He formally declared that Mother Mary Veronica of the Passion, a little-known Carmelite nun, had lived a life of ‘heroic virtue’. His decree opens the way for the search for two miracles first to declare her ‘Blessed’ and finally to canonise her as a saint. The Pope (left) declared that Mother Mary Veronica of the Passion (right) had lived a life of 'heroic virtue' Born Sophie Leeves, Mother Mary Veronica founded the Sisters of the Apostolic Carmel, a religious congregation of Carmelite nuns based in India. She was born in 1823 in Constantinople to the Rev. Henry Daniel Leeves, an Anglican chaplain to the British Embassy there, and Marina Haultain, the daughter of a Colonel in British Army. But when she was a teenager she felt drawn to the Roman Catholic Church and she converted at the age of 27 during a visit to Malta in 1850. She became a nun the following year and in 1863 accepted a teaching post in Kozhikode in India and she went on to found her own teaching order five years later. In 1892 the order was formally affiliated with the Discalced Carmelite Order and today it has branches in India, Sri Lanka, Kuwait, Pakistan, Kenya, Rome and Bahrain. Mother Veronica died on 16 November 1906 at the age of 83 and her cause was opened at the request of her order in 1997. The progress of her cause to sainthood came just a month after Pope Francis also recognised the heroic virtues of Frances Taylor, a nurse who tended dying soldiers alongside Florence Nightingale in the Crimean War. Pope Francis also recognised the heroic virtues of Frances Taylor, a nurse who tended dying soldiers in the Crimean War . Frances, the youngest of 10 children of an Anglican vicar from Lincolnshire, was 22 when she volunteered to join the Lady of the Lamp in Scutari, Turkey, in 1854 when Britain was at war with Russia. She was deeply impressed by the faith of the dying Irish soldiers she was caring for and she became a Catholic while serving in the field. She established a religious order – the Poor Servants of the Mother of God – which under her direction opened refuges for prostitutes and homeless women and children in London before spreading throughout Europe. As Mother Magdalen Taylor, Frances also founded the Providence Free Hospital in St Helens, Lancashire, and she took over the running of St Joseph’s Asylum in Dublin. She died in her convent in Soho Square in 1900 after falling ill en route to Rome and she is buried at Roehampton, south west London, after establishing 20 institutions in her own lifetime. Today her order continues to work particularly with the poor, the elderly and the disabled. The last British women to be declared as saints were Anne Line, Margaret Ward and Margaret Clitherow, who were among the 40 English and Welsh Martyrs of the Protestant Reformation canonised by Pope Paul VI in 1970. Other British women who are being considered for sainthood include Elizabeth Prout, a 19th century Passionist nun who worked in the slums of Manchester; Mary Potter, a Londoner who founded an order of nursing nuns in Nottingham in the same period, and Margaret Sinclair, a 20th century Scottish nun who died of tuberculosis after tending to the poor of Edinburgh. The Vatican is also studying the sainthood causes of London-born Mother Riccarda Beauchamp Hambrough, a Bridgettine nun who helped to hide about 60 Jews from the Nazis in her Rome convent during the Second World War, and Mother Katherine Flanagan, also a London-born Bridgettine.","Mother Mary Veronica of the Passion was a little-known Carmelite nun .

"Christopher Cruz is accused of causing a crash and sparking a confrontation that left a fellow member of his biker club paralyzed and led to a tech executive being brutally beaten in front of his wife and young child. But Cruz says it's his life that's ruined. The 28-year-old father of two claims he never intended to box in Alexian Lien's Range Rover SUV on New York City's West Side Highway last Sunday - he was only changing lanes and looked back to see where his friends are. Scroll down for video . No guilt: Christopher Cruz, 28, says he is not responsible for the injury of a fellow biker or the beating of Alexian Lien - even though he is accused of starting the crash that kicked off the violence . Police say this is Christopher Cruz, seen on a helmet cam video moments before Mr Lien's SUV struck his motorcycle . Cruz isn't charged with participating in the horrific six-on-one beating that left Mr Lien hospitalized, but police believe that he was trying to force him to slow down or stop. He is charged with reckless driving and false imprisonment. He says the charges and the publicity from the case have ruined him. 'It's turned my life upside down right now,' he told ABC's 'Good Morning America' Monday. He also denied that he was driving recklessly. Badly injured: Lien needed stitches after he was attacked by bikers in New York. He hit some bikers in a bid to escape them but they caught up and beat him . Cruz is charged with reckless driving and unlawful imprisonment, but he has retained an attorney and is fighting the charges . Christopher Cruz, pictured here, could face additional charges, police say . 'I had no intentions to slow him down or to cause any type of problem,' Cruz . 'I didn't think I was doing anything wrong by just cutting into another lane.' Video from a fellow rider's helmet cam shows Cruz looking back as he changes lanes inches in front of the SUV. Mr Lien then struck Cruz's motorcycle. After the collision, Mr Lien then panicked and plowed through the crowd of bikers that stopped around him. Mr Lien struck Edwin Mieses Jr., 26, and ran him over run over, leaving him with broken bones and spine injury that paralyzed him. Mr Lien called 911 and attempted to flee the bikers, but they chased after him. When he exited the highway and had to stop for traffic, several furious bikers attacked the SUV, pulled Mr Lien and brutally pummeled him - including stomping on his head. But Cruz says he has no guilt about the incident, which all started with the crash he is accused of causing. 'I don't feel responsible,' he said. 'But I do feel bad for the family that go hurt.' Busted: Reginald Chance is accused of shaming Mr Lien's window with his helmet before beating him . Chance turned himself into police and was arraigned in Manhattan . Police have arrested two other men in connection with the attack. Reginald Chance, 38, is accused of smashing Mr Lien's window out with his helmet. Robert Sims, 35, is accused of stomping on Mr Lien's head as he tried to crawl away from his attackers. The NYPD has released a picture of a third suspected attacker. However, the New York Post reported this weekend that detectives believe up to six bikers participated in the savage beatdown of Mr Lien. Kevin Bresloff, the biker who filmed much of the encounter, says he has received death threats from other members of the biker club because he is cooperating with police detectives investigating the incident.

"Wikileaks founder Julian Assange walked into the Knightsbridge embassy to claim asylum . Ecuador's President said today the . South American nation would have to consider 'whether Julian Assange's life is at . stake', with a decision on his asylum claim expected to be made later . today. The Wikileaks founder spent a second night at the Ecuadorian Embassy last night, after making a last-ditch plea for political asylum. Mr Assange, 40, is attempting to evade extradition to Sweden, where he faces sex attack allegations, and walked into the Ecuadorian Embassy in London two nights ago, claiming political asylum and citing his human rights. President Rafael Correa told BBC Mundo the country 'defends the right to live'. President Correa also said: 'We are analysing Julian Assange's asylum request in a very serious and responsible way. We can't give an official response until the analysis of his request is complete.' A police source today confirmed Assange will be arrested if he leaves the Ecuadorian Embassy. There are currently no arrangements in place to provide him with safe passage out of the UK should he be granted asylum by the South American country. President Correa told Venezuela's Telesur TV network in Rio de Janeiro: 'He wants to continue his mission in a country, and I cite it textually because the sentence impressed me a lot, that he wants to continue his mission of free expression without limits, to reveal the truth, in a place of peace dedicated to truth and justice.' Meanwhile, Assange's celebrity backers faced an embarrassing £240,000 financial headache following his bid to avoid extradition to Sweden over alleged sex attacks. The WikiLeaks founder walked into the Ecuadorian Embassy in London claiming political asylum and citing his human rights. But Scotland Yard said he faced arrest for breaching his bail conditions – while a list of high-profile supporters, led by socialite Jemima Khan, risk losing tens of thousands of pounds they put up to keep him out of jail. The desperate move by Mr Assange, 40, stunned Miss Khan, who confirmed she was one of those who put up the cash for him. Asked on Twitter whether she was 'on the hook' for his breach of bail, she replied: 'Yes. I had expected him to face the allegations. I am as surprised as anyone by this.' Scroll down for video . Protest: Supporters of Julian Assange demonstrated outside the Ecuadorian Embassy, where the Wikileaks founder has sought political asylum . Bianca Jagger, film-makers Michael Moore and Ken Loach, and journalists John Pilger and Tariq Ali were among those who offered to support Mr Assange's bail while he fought a legal battle to avoid being sent to Sweden, where he faces accusations of raping a woman and sexually molesting and coercing another in Stockholm in 2010. Among those believed to have been accepted as guarantors are journalist Phillip Knightley, magazine publisher Felix Dennis, Nobel Prize winner Sir John Sulston and Labour peer Lord Evans of Temple Guiting. Miss Jagger said on Twitter: 'I would like to set the record straight. I didn't post bail for Julian Assange.' Film director Ken Loach and socialite Jemima .

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange with his lawyer Jennifer Robinson . Jemima Khan and Tony Benn arrive to attend the extradition case of Julian Assange at Belmarsh Magistrates' Court in Woolwich, south-east London, in February 2011 . Those who did stand surety for Mr Assange – freed on bail in December 2010 after spending nine days in Wandsworth jail when held under a European arrest warrant issued by the Swedes – risked losing their money the minute he walked into the Knightsbridge embassy, just yards from Harrods, on Thursday evening. Embassies are regarded as 'safe havens' which British police cannot enter. While Mr Assange remains inside the building he is safe from arrest – and extradition. He requested political asylum under the UN Human Rights Declaration, ironic given Ecuador's poor record on human rights and free speech. But Mr Assange is friendly with the . South American country's socialist leader Rafael Correa. Last month the . Australian interviewed him for his new TV series The World Tomorrow, . broadcast on the Russian state-sponsored Today TV channel, in which the . president – who has clashed with Washington – praised WikiLeaks and the . two men laughed and joked. The dramatic move to seek refuge . inside the embassy came days after the Supreme Court rejected Mr . Assange's appeal against extradition. He was expected to be sent to . Sweden within a fortnight. He denies the Swedish allegations but . fears it may lead to him being sent to the US to face charges over his . whistle-blowing website, for which he could face the death penalty for . espionage. The Metropolitan Police said it had . been told at 10.20pm on Tuesday that Mr Assange had breached a bail . condition, that he stay at a specific address between 10pm and 8am. 'He is now subject to arrest under the . Bail Act for breach of these conditions,' a spokesman said. 'Officers . are aware of his location at the Ecuador Embassy.' Mr Assange's friend Gavin Macfadyen, . from the Centre for Investigative Journalism at City University, emerged . from the embassy at lunchtime. He said: 'He is in very good humour and . grateful for the hospitality of the embassy. He is meeting with the . lawyers now to discuss all of it.' Ecuador has already said it is . seeking the views of the UK, Swedish and US governments before deciding . on the asylum application. If they decide not to hand Mr Assange . back there will be a messy diplomatic spat, with Britain and Washington . putting pressure on the Ecuador government and stressing there is no . humanitarian or legal reason for keeping him inside the embassy. ÷ Corruption, inefficiency and political influence have plagued the Ecuadorian judiciary for many years. ÷ In a referendum held in 2011, President Rafael Correa obtained a mandate for constitutional reforms that would significantly increase government powers to constrain media and influence the appointment and dismissal of judges. ÷ Ecuador's laws restrict freedom of expression, and government officials, including Correa, use these laws against critics. Those involved in protests marred by violence may be prosecuted on inflated 'terrorism' charges. ÷ Police often attribute murders to a 'settling of accounts' between criminal gangs, with prosecutions and convictions rare. ÷  in April 2010 a gang of hitmen composed of active-duty police was exposed. It was claimed that the officers involved were part of a 'social cleansing group' that killed delinquents in Quevedo, Los Rios Province. ÷ The majority of child workers in the banana industry quit school before the age of 15 and are often forced to work gruelling hours for little pay. Some children work 12-hour shifts in hazardous conditions, experience sexual harassment and little in the way of sanitation. ÷ The country's security forces have been accused of using excessive force, sometimes with impunity amid claims of isolated unlawful killings. ÷ Social problems include aggression against journalists; violence against women; discrimination against ethnic and gay groups; people trafficking; sexual exploitation of minors and child labour. ÷ Vigilante justice remains a problem. Such violence occurs particularly in indigenous communities and poor neighborhoods of major cities. ÷ While the constitution and laws prohibit torture and similar forms of intimidation, some police officers have reportedly tortured and abused suspects and prisoners. ÷ From 2007 through to August 2010, the National Police held 503 disciplinary tribunals for abuses committed by police. As a result, 367 police officers were dismissed, 171 were arrested and 68 were sanctioned. ÷ Prisons and detention centres are overcrowded by 93 per cent.

"Who stole the cookie from the cookie jar? O.J. Simpson, apparently. The former gridiron great was recently caught pilfering the sweet treats from the cafeteria of his Nevada prison - something which is strictly forbidden. According to a source, guards noticed the 66-year-old hiding something under his prison clothes as he walked back to his cell after lunch. Cookie monster: Former gridiron great O.J. Simpson, pictured left and right in May, was recently caught pilfering cookies from the cafeteria of his Nevada prison - something which is strictly forbidden . When they quizzed him, he revealed a stash of more than a dozen oatmeal cookies, which were then seized. 'O.J. just stood there with a goofy grin on his face as the guard kept digging inside his shirt and throwing the cookies on the floor,' the source told The National Enquirer. Doctors had previously warned Simpson, who is looking noticeably tubby, to ease up on the fat and sugar laden foods and start exercising more because he suffers severe diabetes. And the once-chiseled prisoner, who is serving a 33-year sentence for armed robbery, has been trying to diet but gave up after a few weeks. Lighter days: Simpson, pictured in the 1960s, previously had a toned physique . 'The temptation of the cookies in the prison chow line was too much for him, the source said. At first, his fellow prisoners thought he had smuggled in a cell phone or some other banned item. 'So when the guard started pulling cookies out of O.J.'s shirt, the other inmates started laughing so hard they nearly fell over,' the insider added. The guard could have written up Simpson for the attempted cookie smuggle but he reportedly decided to let him off with a warning.

"Spare a thought for those trying to live on £100,000 to £370,000 a year – it is, apparently, just not enough. Once they have clawed their way into the top one per cent of earners, they soon find themselves struggling to keep up with those making even more. Dubbed the ‘squeezed upper middle’, they don’t find it easy to maintain their six-figure lifestyles. Although they might earn up to 14 times more than the average worker, they still complain of feeling the pinch. Scroll down for video . The 'squeezed upper middle' class are struggling  to live on £100,000 to £370,000 a year . That’s because the gulf between them and the super-rich at the very top of the one per cent bracket is so great. Soon, as their vast incomes are gobbled up on private education for their children and big properties, they become resentful and envious of those with even more wealth. Those who make up the top half per cent above them, with salaries that can run into the millions, include bankers and footballers. Danny Dorling, a geography professor at Oxford University, describes the trend in his book Inequality and the 1 per cent. He said the have-lots were particularly common in London, where so many of the super-rich live. ‘It would be very hard to find someone in London with a household income of between £200,000 and £350,000 who told you they felt comfortable, and that is remarkable,’ he told the Sunday Times. As a couple with two children, you need to earn £200,000 to be classed in the top one per cent . He said those in this bracket often mistakenly regarded themselves as the ‘squeezed middle’, even though with the average UK income at just under £27,000, they are somewhat beyond the middle. The average for the top one per cent of earners is £369,000. The squeezed upper middle includes senior managers, lawyers, accountants, BBC executives, hospital consultants and university vice-chancellors. To be in this group, a single person has to earn at least £100,000, a childless couple £160,000 and a couple with two children £200,000. Professor Dorling says those in this group are likely to begrudge paying for other people’s education through their taxes, while shelling out for their own family privately. Peter York, a social commentator and co-founder of the management consultancy SRU, said: ‘People who are doing very well consider themselves hard done by, as in London and the South-East they are squeezed out of the places they want to live, squeezed into private services they can’t afford and psychologically squeezed by the presence nearby of the luxury life.’ The upper middles have an ‘unrealistic vision of the world’, according to Mr York, because they constantly compare themselves with the super-rich. Calculations by the Institute for Fiscal Studies show members of the squeezed upper middle have enjoyed earnings growth of 118 per cent in the past 25 years. Yet the price of status purchases has risen faster: a four-bedroom property in central London has gone up by 523 per cent, for example, and private day-school fees by 461 per cent. However, there is little public sympathy for high earners who claim to be struggling. Foreign and Commonwealth Office minister Mark Simmonds faced criticism when he resigned last month, saying he and his wife could not afford a family life on a joint income and expenses of about £140,000. Another top earner decided to swap careers when he realised that as long as he was paying the top rate of tax there would be little money left after school fees for three children. Divyang Mistry, 50, earned £200,000 as a director of a corporate communications firm, but still had to borrow money from his father to buy a family home in Hertfordshire. He decided to change job and set up two online companies, which meant he could keep more for his family by paying less tax.","The ‘squeezed upper middle’ class on six-figure salaries are struggling .

In the firing line: Ed Miliband's own home near Hampstead Heath, was bought in his then girlfriend, now wife Justine Thornton's name in 2009 for £1.6million, but is now thought to be worth around £2million . Battle royale: Myleene and Ed went toe-to-toe on TV over the mansion tax last night and the consensus from viewers was that the singer 'wiped the floor' with the Labour leader . She said: 'Immediately you conjure up an image of these Barbie-esque houses, but in London, which is where 80 per cent of the people who will be paying this tax actually live, have you seen what that amount of money can get you? It’s like a garage'. TV viewers provided a running commentary on Twitter, describing how the singer was ‘doing a Paxman’ and ‘wiping the floor’ with the man who hopes to be the next prime minister. Mr Miliband tried to defend his policy but looked lost and bewildered as the former Hear'Say singer tore into his pledge to impose a tax on homes worth more than £2million. But Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves slammed the singer’s claim that £2million would only get you a garage in the capital. She told LBC radio: ‘Look the mansion tax and what she said on the mansion tax – that you can only get a garage in London for £2million – that is absolutely wrong. ‘My family have lived in South London for all of my life and for generations and you can certainly get more than a garage for £2million. I would say, what planet is she on? However, the singer is right about garages being expensive, because last month one in Chelsea sold for an eye-watering £550,000. Overall it is estimated that 108,000 homes – the vast majority in London and the South East – will be caught by the tax. This is what £2million can buy you: . In Islington a four-bedroom terraced property was on sale for £2,000,000. A similar house on the same street sold for £430,000 in 1999, and is now estimated to be worth £2,036,764. A four-bedroom semi-detached riverside home in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, was being sold with a guide price of £2,000,000, in an area where average prices have risen 19.34per cent in the last five years. Just outside Glasgow, a four-bedroom former farm house is on sale with a guide price of £2,100,000. The property, which was completely rebuilt in 1999, boasts five acres of formal gardens and an open plan design. Other homes in the surrounding area have seen their value rise by an average of 2.88per cent in the last year. In Oxford, semi-detached town houses in desirable parts of the city, where homes sold for around £400,000 in the mid-90s, are on sale for more than £2million. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps has branded the mansion tax plan as an attack on ordinary taxpayers whose family home has soared in value. This six-bedroom detached house in Formby, Merseyside is on sale for £2million, and boasts a heated swimming pool and a snooker room. Average prices on the street currently stand at £910,795 - an increase of 5.27per cent from five years ago. A neighbouring ten-bedroom property sold for £2million in 2005, and is now thought to be worth £2,152,966. A guide price of £2,095,000 would buy this four-bedroom farmhouse near Ilkley, West Yorkshire, which comes complete with its own swimming pool and spa. Homes in the area sell for an average of £962,016, an increase of 12 per cent from 2009. Critics have also expressed fears that introducing such a tax would require every home to be accurately valued, which would lead to potentially lengthy appeals should homeowners disagree with the valuation - all of which would come at a cost. Offers of around £2million are being taken for a four-bedroom farmhouse near Tregony in South Cornwall, an area where prices have gone up 7.56per cent since 2009. It could also put off wealthy foreign buyers from moving to the UK, and older people who purchased their homes before their value sky-rocketed and who now have a low-income could be forced to sell up and move as they would be unable to pay a new tax. A three-bedroom detached house in Heddon-On-The-Wall, outside Newcastle Upon Tyne is on sale for £2.2m. There are also fears a mansion tax could put people off making modifications to their homes that might push up the value, having a negative knock on effect on the construction industry. And for £550,000.... This dilapidated old shed, which doubled for a garage, in Chelsea, has been snapped up for £550,000 before it had a chance to go under the hammer .","Ed Miliband quizzed by Myleene Klass over Labour’s £2m mansion tax plan .

"A teenager thought to be possessed by the devil was subjected to a violent crucifixion-style exorcism by four religious extremists, a court in France heard today (Monday). Three men and a woman belonging to the Seventh Day Adventist Church are accused of kidnapping, and acts of torture and barbarism against the 19-year-old. The young woman, referred to solely by the name Antoinette, was barely alive when police found her in a flat in a housing estate in the Paris suburb of Grigny. Grigny, Paris, where a teenager was almost killed during an 'exorcism' by members of the Seventh Day Adventist church . Her tormentors are accused of tying her up like Jesus on the cross, and keeping Antoinette in the same position for seven days during 2011. They believed that this would exorcise her from her sins, and get rid of the devil inside her. In the meantime Antoinette was regularly beaten, and only allowed small amounts of cooking oil and water so as to stay alive. Eric Deron, the teenager’s former boyfriend and the defendant who is thought to have instigated the assault, believed he was on a divine mission, Essonne Assizes, near Paris, heard. Grigny, a suburb of Paris where the alleged exorcism took place . Deron is on trial along with his mother, Lise-Michelle Babin, and two men called Philippe Grego and Lionel Fremor, all from the French Caribbean. According to statements read out in court, Deron was convinced his girlfriend was possessed because ‘she leapt on him’ while shouting incomprehensibly. She had met her alleged assailants in 2008, through the Seventh Day Adventists, an America-based Protestant church which has millions of followers throughout the world. Jacques Bourdais, barrister for the defendants, told French news agency AFP: ‘To them, she was possessed, that is why they did not call a doctor. 'You call a doctor when someone is sick, when someone is possessed you exorcise them.' Mr Bourdais said the victim ‘was very much in love with Eric. They all shared strong religious convictions, and a thorough understanding of the biblical texts.’ The accused all deny any wrongdoing against the woman, claiming she consented to the exorcism. A spokesman for the Seventh Day Adventists said all the men had been expelled from church before the alleged attack. He said that what happened had nothing to do with their teaching. The case continues until Friday.","Woman barely alive when found after 'exorcism' court heard today .

"A bull earmarked for slaughter because it is gay has been saved by The Simpsons co-creator Sam Simon as the terminal cancer sufferer continues to spend his $100million fortune on animal rights causes. Benjy, an Irish bull in County Mayo, Ireland, had been facing slaughter for being gay after a veterinarian declared his sexual orientation the reason he wouldn't breed. But when The Simpsons co-creator Sam Simon heard of his fate, he put up £5,000 to buy Benjy and transport him to a sanctuary where he will now live out his natural life in peace. Scroll down for video . Benjy (pictured), the gay bull in County Mayo, will now live out the remainder of his life in peace following Simon's £5,000 donation . The Simpson's co-creator Sam Simon (pictured) has saved the 'gay' bull that was destined for slaughter . The bull's transfer is expected to take place in time for Christmas. Simon, who is also a long-time vegan, said: 'PETA told me about Benjy, and I felt compelled to help. All animals have a dire destiny in the meat trade, but to kill this bull because he's gay would've been a double tragedy. 'It thrills me to help PETA and ARAN make Benjy's fate a sanctuary rather than a sandwich.' Simon was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2012 and has chosen to use his money and the time he has left to help animals in need. This includes getting 17 bears transferred from virtually barren concrete pits to a lush new home, helping retire a lame horse used for racing and securing the transfer of a chimpanzee who had spent more than 18 years in solitary confinement at a zoo to a reputable sanctuary. He also runs The Sam Simon Foundation, an organisation dedicated to rescuing and rehabilitating homeless dogs. Given three months to live in 2012, Simon immediately decided to team up with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) president Ingrid Newkirk, and dedicate his time to the rescue of maltreated animals and conservation. Creators of The Simpsons Matt Groening, James Brooks, and Sam Simon (right) are interviewed about the hit show in the early 1990s . Sam Simon (pictured centre) with dogs rescued from a shelter that was not providing them with the care they needed - a venture he launched with PETA . Having defied that diagnosis’ original death sentence, Simon continues to push ahead and has also funded projects such as 'Feeding Families' to help with the underprivileged in inner cities. And now, as he enters the twilight of his life, has declared himself never happier and finally at peace. Simon has no children and is not married so he wants to give his millions to causes he cares about. He was married to actress Jennifer Tilly in the 1980s but divorced in 1991 though they remain close. In addition to the money fronted by Simon, more than 250 other individuals have donated to fund the bull's transfer via a crowd-funding initiative set up by Irish animal-protection group ARAN and TheGayUK.com. Simon recently told NBC that Ingrid Newkirk, the founder of PETA, created a 'therapy' for him. 'We planned and are still planning a series of animal liberations and actions that I get to participate in and enjoy. It gives me something to look forward. 'I get to watch these animals that have been in concrete bunkers their whole lives take their first step on grass.'","Bull earmarked for slaughter because it's 'gay' saved by Simpsons creator .

"A nine-year-old girl with a broken leg was told to ‘walk it off’ by a doctor, her family claims. Lucy Holmes was rollerskating with a friend when she fell and injured her leg two weeks ago. Her mother Helen rushed her to the accident and emergency department at Hull Royal Infirmary, where she says they had to wait about six hours before being seen. The doctor who examined Lucy asked her to walk on the injured leg, the family claims, but instead of sending her for an x-ray, the medic told her to go home and keep trying to walk. Lucy Holmes, nine, was told by an A&E doctor to go home and try to walk on her injured leg, which turned out to be fractured . Lucy, pictured with her parents Helen and Lee Holmes, had been rollerskating and fell while trying to dodge a crack in the pavement . After a night of agony, Lucy returned to the Yorkshire hospital, where an x-ray showed she had a serious spiral fracture. Lucy said: 'I was skating with my friend and I tried to avoid a pothole when I fell over. 'As I fell my leg went the other way, it was really painful. 'We went to hospital and I was really scared. I was told to walk on it but it was too sore. I can’t remember much else as I was in so much pain. 'It was a horrible experience. 'I am gutted as it is just the start of the summer holidays and I was looking forward to my holiday in Majorca, which we can’t go on now.' Her father Lee said his daughter's treatment was 'unacceptable'. 'We feel really guilty because we were getting annoyed with Lucy on the Sunday night and said she must be overacting,' he said. Mr Holmes said: 'We are not seeking monetary compensation but we want to highlight the problems we suffered. Lucy Holmes spent a night in agony before returning to hospital the next day for an x-ray . 'There is something drastically wrong when you can’t get an x-ray. We know there have been some cuts but is my daughter not worth an x-ray?” The family, from Bilton, near Hull, have since found out that they will not be able to get a refund on their planned holiday to Majorca - because their travel insurance expired the day before Lucy's accident. Mr Holmes said: 'We booked the holiday in February and were still insured. 'We . understand there’s not a lot we can do but we hoped we might be able to . pull on the heart strings and get something sorted on compassionate . grounds. 'But, as it stands, we will have to pay between 70 and 90 per cent of the £2,000 holiday.' Lucy will now spend her school summer holiday in plaster while the family have had to cancel their trip to Majorca . Lucy’s grandmother Pauline Holmes said: 'Something has to be done about this. 'You have to trust what the doctors say but when something like this happens you just don’t know right from wrong.' Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust has confirmed it is looking into the case. A spokesman said: 'For patient confidentiality reasons, we are unable to comment on the specific details of Miss Holmes’ treatment. 'We understand the family is in contact with our Patient Advice and Liaison team and we will be happy to discuss their concerns and respond to them directly in due course.'","Lucy Holmes fell over and injured her leg while rollerskating with a friend .

"Calum Best is embarking upon a hair overhaul: the model and actor has shaved off his enormous bushy beard as he prepares to undergo his third hair transplant in just two years. The 33-year-old star - son of the late footballing legend George Best - is clean shaven again after finally ditching his hipster beard, which took him six months to grow to its full length. The model had followed the lead of stars such as David Beckham, George Clooney, Bradley Cooper and Ben Affleck, who all made beards fashionable again in the last year. Scroll down for video . Before and after: Calum tired of the daily maintenance involved in maintaining the beard, which he nicknamed 'Gandalf', so decided to shave it off and now he's about to undergo a hair transplant . Clean shaven: Calum Best has shaven off his beard, which took him six months to grow to its full length, as he prepares for his third hair transplant in two years . But Calum tired of the daily maintenance involved in maintaining the beard, which he nicknamed 'Gandalf' after the Lord of the Rings wizard played by Ian McKellen. Calum said: 'It turns into a daily grind making sure it is ship shape. It needs a lot more maintenance than your head hair and you have the added complication of keeping it clean. I feel ten years younger without it.' Calum grew the beard earlier this year for his lead role in the movie Countryman. He also featured as a heavily bearded executive in an advert for Rolls Royce in Dubai. In character: Calum grew the beard earlier this year for his lead role in the movie Countryman . Modelling: Calum starred as a heavily bearded executive in an advert for Rolls Royce in Dubai . He soon found that being hirsute helped him to find work as a model and actor. He explained: 'I was originally going to shave it off after the film but I found it was definitely good for business. A beard of that length gives you a whole different look and gives you a unique selling point.' 'Losing that beard has taken a decade off me,' he said. 'There is no doubt a beard ages you. People associate them with middle-aged men.' Party-loving Calum admitted that the reaction from women had been mixed. 'Some love that whole caveman thing and can't get enough it,' he explained. 'But there is no doubt many others find it a turn-off and don't fancy kissing a guy with a bush on his chin.' Calum also ditched his beard for practical reasons because next month he is undergoing his third £6,000 hair transplant. The star has already had two procedures after first  losing his hair in his early 20s. He believes he damaged his hair follicles by pulling it back in a tight ponytail. His best asset: Calum found that being hirsute helped him to find work as a model and actor. 'I was originally going to shave it off after the film but I found it was definitely good for business. A beard of that length gives you a whole different look and gives you a unique selling point', he said . He also thinks he hastened his hair loss by over-bleaching. He refused to take the clinically proven drug Propecia, which would have halted his hair loss, because it affects the sex drive of 2 per cent of patients. 'It may only be two guys in a 100 but I didn't want to take the risk,' he laughed. Calum, from Fulham, London, is having 3,000 hairs transplanted from the side to the front of his hairline which is still receding, particularly at the temples. He said: 'All the transplanted hair is permanent - the problem I have is that I am still losing my natural hair.' 'These procedures have completely changed my life. They have given me so much more confidence and enabled me to wear my hair just the way I like. The fact that I still have my hair helps me to get film roles.' Ageless: Calum says he feels ten years younger without his shaggy beard. 'There is no doubt a beard ages you. People associate them with middle-aged men,' he said . Thinning: The star has already had two procedures after first losing his hair in his early 20s. Pictured, left, before his first transplant and, right, after . Dr Shahmalak of the Crown Clinic in Manchester, who has performed hair transplants on a string of celebrities and will be doing Calum's for the third time, said: 'If you make your living in the public eye, you need to look good. 'How many movie heart-throbs are there who are bald? Lots of men need more than one transplant, particularly if they prefer not to take Propecia. 'Like Calum, Wayne Rooney has also had two hair transplants.

"Against a backdrop of a tumbling Big Ben and Houses of Parliament, a grinning ISIS commander has been taunting Britain with his plans to launch an attack on the West. Abu Omar al-Shishani, one of the most feared military commanders of the Islamic State of Syria and Iraq, has issued the image as part of a campaign to intimidate Britain. It features two bearded fighters with their hands shading their eyes, looking at London as it burns in a ball of computer generated flames. The warning comes as the ISIS executioner known as 'Jihadi John' warned Barack Obama: 'The Islamic State will soon, like your puppet David Cameron said, begin to slaughter your people in your streets.' Threat: Abu Omar al-Shishani's image features militants (top left) with their hands shading their eyes as they watch London burn in a ball of computer generated flames. Al-Shishani also appears grinning in the image . Militant: Al-Shishani is considered one of the most influential military leaders of the Syrian opposition forces and has been referred to as 'the military commander' suggesting he is in overall command of the ISIS armies . International: Abu Omar al-Shishani heads up one of the largest groups of foreign fighters in Syria and is known to count British recruits among his band which has had both Facebook and Twitter pages in English . ISIS followers are known to have planned attacks in Britain and Europe, although the degree to which they are directed by the high command has been unclear. The language used in the latest video, which shows the head of US aid worker Peter Kassig, suggests they are planning attacks outside their borders. The new imagery, posted on the internet by Chechen fighters serving with ISIS and entitled “Omar Shishani in London,” reinforces the idea that the group now has global ambitions similar to al-Qaeda. Al-Shishani, a red-bearded ethnic Chechen, is pictured grinning in the bottom right of the image. He heads up one of the largest groups of foreign fighters in Syria and is known to count British recruits among his band which has had both Facebook and Twitter pages in English. Ramzan Kadyrov, the Russian-backed hardline leader of the Chechen Republic, announced that Shishani had been killed by posting a picture on Instagram last Thursday, although the death remains unconfirmed and he gave no location. Shishani is considered one of the most influential military leaders of the Syrian opposition forces and has been referred to as 'the military commander' suggesting he is in overall command of the ISIS armies. He is believed to have recruited Abdul Waheed Majeed, 41, a British father of three from Crawley, West Sussex, who died when he drove a dumper truck packed full of explosives into Aleppo Prison in a suicide attack in February. His other followers included Ibrahim al-Mazwagi, from North London, who was 21 when he was killed in Syria in February last year. A graduate from Hertfordshire University, he was of Libyan origin, and had fought in that conflict in 2011 before moving on to Syria where he told his family he was doing charity work. Recruit: Al-Shishani is believed to have recruited Abdul Waheed Majeed (pictured left and right) a father of three from Crawley, West Sussex, who died when he truck packed full of explosives into Aleppo Prison . Suicide bomber: The video shows Abdul Waheed Majeed driving at high speed towards Aleppo Prison . Explosion: Seconds later the truck's explosives detonate, killing Abdul Waheed Majeed . Abu Omar al-Shishani is a nom de-guerre which refers to his Chechen origins. His real name is Tarkhan Batirashvili, 28, and he is a former sergeant in the Georgian Army. He was born to an Orthodox Christian father and Muslim mother and brought up in the Pankisi Gorge, an ethnically Chechen area of North East Georgia, where he worked as a shepherd before joining the army when he left school. He fought in the brief conflict between Russia and Georgia in 2008 and became a jihadist after being discharged from the Georgian military on health grounds after contracting tuberculosis. After recuperating and being refused reenlistment, he was arrested for stockpiling weapons and jailed in September 2010. Following his release, he travelled to Istanbul in Turkey in March 2012, to join Chechen rebels in the Syrian conflict. He became the commander of a group of hardened Chechen fighters known as Katibat al-Muhajireen [Emigrants Brigade] which was initially aligned with al-Qaeda's Jabhat al-Nusra. The group merged with other jihadists in March 2013 to form Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar [Army of Emigrants and Supporters], a larger and more structured group with a religious council. Terror: Abu Omar al-Shishani's warning comes after Jihadi John (pictured) warned Barack Obama: 'The Islamic State will soon, like your puppet David Cameron said, begin to slaughter your people in your streets' Sick: Abu Omar al-Shishani's image is not the first time ISIS has taunted the West by threatening to attack a landmark. A chilling threat was posted on Twitter on June 20 purportedly from someone with a connection to the extremist group. The images were taken outside the White House and Chicago's Old Republic Building . In May 2013, Shishani switched to supporting the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and was named commander of the northern sector of Syria, around Aleppo. Units under his command have participated in major assaults on Syrian military bases in and around Aleppo, including the capture of Menagh Airbase in August 2013. Raffaello Pantucci, of the Royal United Services Institute think tank, said: 'Omar al-Shishani is the most prominent of the Caucasian fighters alongside ISIS and is seen as the leader of the foreign fighter brigades. 'He has a long history of conflict which has given him a prominent role amongst the ISIS foreign fighter brigades. 'We have seen how Brits and other Europeans have often been marshalled under his wing and the result is that he is elevated to be a figure of great significance in the mythology around the group and what it is doing, in particular in the imagery and videos they release. 'While his skills and abilities have been called into question by others, he has undeniably become the most prominent of the so-called Chechen fighters in Syria.'","Abu Omar al-Shishani is one of ISIS' most feared military commanders .

"Jerry Wayne Hale, 30, was shot on Thursday after he tried to rob Keith Hall's home . Texas police shot an armed homeowner dead on Thursday, just seconds . after he killed a burglar who tried to break into his house. According to the Dallas Morning News reports, burglar Jerry . Wayne Hale, 30, thought the 'reclusive' homeowner' was already dead. He allegedly came to . collect Keith Hall’s possessions. Hall, 57, was equipped with a gun before Hale arrived just . before 7:45pm. Witnesses heard gunfire and pleaded with Hall not to shoot . the intruder. They called 911. ‘I said, 'No, don’t kill him. I’ve already called the cops. Cops are on the way,'said witness David Murphey to CBS0-DFW. According to Murphey, the homeowner said, 'Good, I’m going . to kill him and then I’m going to shoot them, too.' Hall shot the intruder, stood over him in an alleyway and told him he wanted to shoot him again. The witnesses ran away, frightened. The police arrived, but this was not enough to get Keith . Hall to cooperate. When police gave him, ‘loud verbal commands to drop the gun,’ he refused and raised his 9mm gun to point it at police officers. Three officers . opened fire and fatally shot 57-year-old Keith Hall. Both Hale and Hall were pronounced dead. No officers were injured. Maj. Jeff Cotner of the crimes against person's division reported on Friday that officers didn't realize Keith Hall was defending his home in the 10300 block of Sandra Lynne Drive. Scroll down for video . Keith Hall lived on the 10300 block of Sandra Lynne Drive, where Hale tried to steal his posessions and both were shot . David Murphrey witnessed the shooting and pleaded with Hall not to shoot Hale . However, according to Cotner, Hall was given plenty of opportunities to drop his weapon. Hall tried to shoot at cops even after he'd been shot down to the floor. 'He’s down on the ground, he’s on his back. His weapon is . nearby,' Cotner said. 'The officers are yelling at him — he’s still alive. He . reaches for his weapon and begins to pick it up and point it again. They fire . again,' he continued. Keith Hall had no criminal record, though he had filed for bankruptcy in 2005. He was described as a 'hoarder' who had been visited by city code enforcement officers about his poor upkeep at home. “He was a loner,” said Hall's 88-year-old neighbor Robert Schreiber. Schreiber said Hall had lived there for . more than 20 years. But he never knew anything about Schreiber other than he never cut his grass. Hale on the other hand had been arrested 14 times since 2000 according to the Department of Public Safety records. He was convicted of theft, unauthorized use of a vehicle, drug possesion charges, and criminal mischief. Hale's girlfriend told police that he went to Hall's home to burglarize it.","The burglar thought the homeowner was already dead when he went to steal his possesions .

"With many seniors facing high medical bills, a congressional investigation has found that federal government websites meant to give Medicare patients basic consumer tools instead fail to provide adequate information on out-of-pocket costs, and even quality of care. The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office found that Medicare lacks clear procedures for getting useful information to consumers. The report, obtained by The Associated Press before its public release, finds 'critical weaknesses' in five consumer-information websites run by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that seek to inform how well hospitals, nursing homes, physicians and other Medicare providers are doing. The GAO said a confusing layout, data gaps and lack of customized information make it virtually impossible for consumers to get the information they need and won't be fixed anytime soon, even as the federal government plans new websites on the quality of hospice, inpatient rehabilitation and long-term care. It is the latest report to detail problems in the government's health care websites. Ready? Set? Good luck: Medicare beneficiaries are often left to fend for themselves because government websites confuse the elderly and fail to provide reliable information about health care choices . Tough milestones: Medicare covers portions of everything from hip surgeries to hospice care, and most American seniors are getting precious little help sorting it out . The Obama administration has already grappled with the technology meltdown experienced last year by Healthcare.gov as well as glitches in the Sept. 30 rollout of data on payments doctors receive from drug companies. 'The GAO report reveals that there is a need to empower patients with better information on health care price and quality,' said Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, home to the nation's fourth-largest share of residents 65 and older, at roughly 1 in 7. Only Florida, West Virginia and Maine have higher percentages of seniors. 'Armed with the facts, it will be possible for consumers to obtain high quality care and drive down costs,' he said. The GAO cautioned that due to a lack of clear policies or performance measures, CMS will likely continue to have 'limited effectiveness in conveying relevant and understandable information on cost and quality to consumers.' It cited a growing need for the information due to rising health care costs. Jim Esquea, an assistant secretary at the Health and Human Services Department, concurred with the recommendations. He wrote that CMS, an agency of HHS, was planning to expand its star ratings, already in use on its 'Nursing Home Compare' website. He also said HHS was committed to providing detail on estimated out-of-pocket costs 'to the extent feasible' and had developed many internal procedures, although GAO said it had found no evidence that was the case. In the study, GAO compared data on CMS' websites with that of third-party vendors providing similar information on gallbladder surgery, magnetic resonance imaging, or MRIs, of the lower back and maternity care. They also examined documents and interviewed company and government officials and experts on best practices. In all, the audit found wide variation in charges for the same medical procedures in the same geographic area regardless of quality – information it said was not readily available on the CMS sites. Esquea said there were challenges in providing cost information. In addition, the CMS sites often lacked critical data on quality of care, such as patient-reported outcomes on common procedures such as a colonoscopy, according to the report. Consumer Reports toaster ratings for life-and-death decisions: The government boils down nursing homes' critical performance metrics to 'star' ratings like those given to small appliances . Nursing home or warehouse? What will it cost after coverage pays its share? Government websites that are supposed to help consumers make difficult end-of-life choices often fall far short of expectations . In interviews with the GAO, CMS officials said they plan to add patient-reported outcomes on a number of medical procedures. The investigators cited a likelihood of continuing problems despite the government's 2011 pledge under the Affordable Care Act to provide consumers complete and understandable information. While CMS has said it will make improvements, GAO pointed to limitations due in part to resistance from medical providers. In recent months, the American Medical Association has opposed Medicare's release of billing records for 880,000 physicians, citing the danger of data being reported inaccurately or taken out of context; much of that information was eventually released. 'People deserve to know information on the cost and quality of the health care services they need,' said New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, one of the lawmakers who requested the report.

"Ray Mabus, the U.S. Navy secretary, has spent more than a full year of his five-year tenure on overseas travel, racking up more than 930,000 miles on trips that cost the taxpayer more than $4.7 million. Mr Mabus, the former governor of Mississippi, has taken at least 40 trips outside the U.S as of July 2014, meeting officials and visiting sailors and Marines in more than 100 countries — travel he said is critical to his job in furthering U.S. and Navy interests abroad. The inspector general investigated after receiving a complaint about his travel and cleared him of any wrongdoing, Mr Mabus said. Keen traveller: Ray Mabus listens as Todd Merchant of the U.S. Navy explains how a computer adjusts biofuel consumption while aboard the USS Chaffee off the coast of Oahu, Hawaii, in July 2012, . His 373 days on the road contrast however with those of Army Secretary John McHugh, who took fewer than half the trips at less than half the cost over the same time period. According to data obtained and compiled by The Associated Press, Mabus' flights cost $4.6 million for fuel, maintenance and crew. Mabus also spent about $116,000 on hotels, meals and other costs. The Army leader's trips totalled 126 days and cost about $2 million for the flights. He spent under $33,000 for hotels, meals and other personal expenses on his 18 trips. Mr Mabus' entourage includes a security officer, military assistant, policy advisers and a public affairs officer — about seven people in all. Their per diem travel costs would approximate Mabus' and could add as much as $700,000 to the total costs of the travel. Mr McHugh travels with up to 10 staff, so the per diem expenses could total more than $300,000. The travel costs come amid deep budget cuts across the Defense Department, including widespread efforts to slash headquarters spending, downsize the Army and Marine Corps, and cut back on acquisition programs, training and other costs. Those cuts, said Bryan Clark, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessment, make it 'even more important that senior leaders scrutinize their travel and make sure that the travel they're doing is essential.' Mr Mabus is so proud of his travel he even has a mileage ticker on his Navy website, showing he has traveled 932,129 miles as of this week. Of the 325,000 sailors and nearly 190,000 Marines, as many as 100,000 are serving in nearly 100 countries around the world. And, he said, negotiating issues such as basing ships in Rota, Spain, is more effective face to face. 'You could do that in a phone call, I guess. You could send them a note,' he said.'I don't think they take it nearly as seriously if you're not sitting across the table from them.' He noted that a female sailor on a stop in Hawaii complained to him that she felt she had no future as a nuclear officer because women couldn't serve on nuclear submarines. That conversation, said Mr Mabus, led to his finalizing plans to allow women to serve on the subs. 'I think the return on investment for my travel has been phenomenal,' Mr Mabus said. 'In terms of the progress we've made with countries like Singapore, Spain, Gabon, Palau, Japan — in terms of advancing America's interests, in terms of advancing Navy interests, in terms of the work that we do together and the benefits that come from that — I think the return on investment has been huge.' This picture of the US Navy website shows a mileage counter, right, of Navy Secretary Ray Mabus travels . Secretary McHugh oversees an Army of more than 508,000 active-duty soldiers, including more than 130,000 in over 150 countries. He said he tries to go where large concentrations of soldiers are as well as countries where there are national security issues. 'I think a lot about the balance between the responsibilities of being here and the requirement to get out,' Mr McHugh said. 'If someone were to ask me, have you traveled too little or too much — I'd say too little. I don't think you can ever be briefed in the Pentagon in a way that provides you an accurate perspective the way you can just seeing it on the ground for 10 minutes.' In May, McHugh stopped in Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania after a company of soldiers participated in military exercises last spring. He said he'd planned to visit only one of those countries, but the State Department advised him to visit all three. According to data provided by the Army, McHugh has traveled to 29 countries, including seven visits to Germany, a frequent refueling and crew rest stop. He's been to Afghanistan four times and Iraq three times and he's made three visits to South Korea, where the Army has had a permanent presence since the Korean war. Mr Mabus had visited 107 countries as of July, including stops at major Navy homeports such as Singapore, Bahrain, Italy and Japan, as well as Africa, where piracy and terrorism have been persistent problems. He's also traveled to Greenland, Iceland and Norway — including a snowmobile safari on the tiny island of Svalbard. The Arctic has become a key national security issue, as melting ice caps are opening up sea lanes and spurring competition for oil and gas deposits. The Navy is developing plans to increase communications, harden ships and negotiate international agreements so nations can better track traffic in the Arctic. Mr Mabus' most frequent destination — 12 stops — was Afghanistan, where thousands of Marines have served. But Spain is also a favorite with nine visits, including five times between May 2013 and June 2014. He said he was in Spain so often because of plans to base four U.S. naval destroyers there as part of the new anti-missile shield. Mabus was there when the first ship arrived in February, was the U.S. representative for a funeral there in March, then was back again in June. But he has also travelled to a number of tiny islands like Kiribati, Sao Tome, Palau, Micronesia and Tonga, as well as landlocked countries where there is little Navy or Marine presence. Lined up along his Pentagon windows are six large glass jars filled with sand he's collected from World War II battlefields he's visited. Mr Mabus' trips also provide fodder for a series of photography books he has self-published. The books sell for up to $220 each, according to the website. But Mr Mabus said he hasn't earned any money from the books since becoming secretary. He said many photographs were taken prior to his Pentagon job, while others were taken during his Navy travels. In a statement, his staff said the photography doesn't interfere with his official duties.","Ray Mabus's 373 days on the road contrast with Army Secretary John McHugh, who took fewer than half the trips .

"Harassed: Campaigner Justyna Pasek . Pro-life campaigners have been threatened with arrest under a draconian ‘riot law’ for holding prayer vigils outside an abortion clinic. Police used legislation which is commonly used to disperse rioters and football hooligans to force three campaigners to move away from the clinic on two separate occasions over the past six weeks. Officers issued the group, who try to persuade women to keep their unborn babies, with Section 14 Public Order Act notices. The strongly worded notice, which was used on both occasions, read: ‘I believe the intention of the organisers is the intimidation of others with a view to  compelling them not to do any act they have a right to do.’ The Scotland Yard inspectors said they thought the group posed a ‘serious risk of disruption to the life of the community’. The group was then ordered by police to continue its vigil on the other side of the road, which meant protesters were unable to talk to any of the patients at the British Pregnancy Advisory Service clinic. Staff at the BPAS clinic have called the police on several occasions to complain about the ‘intimidating behaviour’ of the campaigners. They say the Catholic group is harassing pregnant patients by showing them large photographs of embryos at various stages of pregnancy. However the pro-life campaigners, from the Good Counsel Network (GCN), claim they are acting within the law and only speak to women who are willing to talk. Last night the Metropolitan Police admitted its officers had made a mistake and said the ‘riot law’ should not have been used. But Justyna Pasek, 33, a pregnancy adviser for GCN, said she felt like a criminal when her small team was stopped by the police. ‘We hand out leaflets to pregnant women and speak to women who want to speak to us,’ she said, adding: ‘We don’t chase after women, we don’t stop anyone from going into the clinic and we never block the gates. ‘We just pray all the time and hand out leaflets. But we were made to feel like criminals when the police forced us to move away from the clinic. The officers were very aggressive and I felt very harassed and mistreated by them. ‘I thought this was a free country, but this reminds me of the communist rule I used to live under when I was a little girl in Poland.’ Miss Pasek, who is originally from Wrocław in West Poland, and her colleagues have been holding daily vigils between 8am and 2pm outside the BPAS abortion clinic in Twickenham, West London, since September last year. The GCN also campaigns at two other . clinics in London, and was the first group founded in England to hold . US-style demonstrations outside abortion clinics. But the police have been called on various occasions after staff at the clinic, patients and local residents complained. Clare McCullough, a director at GCN, said: ‘I think the clinic instigated a lot of these complaints. GCN campaigners have been holding daily vigils between 8am and 2pm outside the BPAS abortion clinic in Twickenham, West London, pictured, since September last year . ‘They hate us being there because we see girls coming out and being sick on the pavement and we have seen girls being marched in by parents and boyfriends. ‘The girls sometimes tell us that they don’t want the abortions but they are being forced into them. The clinic just doesn’t like us seeing what they’re doing.’ However last night the pro-life group faced criticism over its tactics. A neighbour of the Twickenham clinic, who asked not to be named, said: ‘I find their behaviour deeply worrying. They are pestering women who are at a difficult time in their lives. ‘What these women need is support – not harassment. I’m pleased the police tried to intervene.’ And BPAS spokesman Clare Murphy said: ‘It is very disappointing that these protesters continue to stand outside clinics. ‘Women tell us that the protesters make them feel intimidated and upset on what is already a very difficult day for them. ‘These vigils are not about helping women, they are about stopping women’s access to abortion.’ She added: ‘BPAS respects the right to protest but asks that protesters respect the rights of women to access legal healthcare services free from harassment. We regularly receive calls from residents who are concerned about the vigils. ‘Everyone, whether they are clinic staff, local residents or pregnant women has the right to contact the police if they feel frightened or intimidated by strangers.’ And she went on to say: ‘Women take the decision to end a pregnancy extremely seriously, and most will talk it over with their partner, a relative or a close friend. ‘They do not want to discuss  it with a line of ideologically  motivated activists as they are entering a clinic.’ A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘We have acknowledged the concerns raised by those affected by our actions. Following a review of the decisions taken on those days, we now acknowledge that the implementation of Section 14 notices under the Public Order Act 1986 was incorrect. ‘The Metropolitan Police Service respects the right to lawful assembly and freedom of speech. ‘But we will take action, where it is appropriate to do so in accordance with legislation, so that we can protect the rights of others not to be intimidated.’","Campaigners holding vigils at BPAS clinic in Twickenham, West London .

"A miracle baby who survived three rounds of chemotherapy while her cancer-stricken mother was pregnant has died in a tragic accident just weeks before her second birthday. Four months into her second pregnancy, Cincinnati, Ohio woman Shana Ficks found a lump in her breast and was diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer. Doctors recommended she terminate the pregnancy but Mrs Ficks refused, so the pair suffered through treatment together. Kelsey Ficks was born on October 17, 2011, a healthy 6lb 10oz, and her mother recovered. But last month, in a heart-breaking twist of fate, Kelsey was killed when she fell backwards on her chair into a glass cabinet while her mother stepped outside for less than two minutes. Tragic: Miracle baby, Kelsey Ficks, pictured left in 2011, survived three rounds of chemotherapy while inside her cancer-stricken mother, Shana Ficks, right, but died in a tragic accident last month . 'We are confused because she fought so hard to get here. Why would she be taken?' Mrs Ficks told Cincinnati.com. 'Both of us just feel so empty,' her husband, David Ficks, added. 'I just want her to walk around the corner and hold her.' The couple were eager to have children as soon as they married 10 years ago and easily became pregnant will their first daughter Taylor. In February 2011, they fell pregnant with Kelsey, but soon they were faced with the difficult decision of whether to abort the baby, following Mrs Ficks' diagnosis. 'I wanted the baby so bad. It was just a miracle she came to us,' she said. 'No, she was not going anywhere.' So the chemotherapy began. 'Kelsey went through the chemo too,' Mrs Ficks said. 'She was my strength. She gave me everything.' Two months after the birth, Mrs Ficks had a double mastectomy and underwent radiation before beginning a breast reconstruction. However, she developed an infection that almost killed her so decided to forgo further surgeries to focus on caring for her girls. 'Just being with my kids is the happiest I've ever been in my life,' Mrs Ficks said. She . recovered and thankfully her breast cancer didn't return. For the next . year, she devoted herself to her babies and husband, snuggling up with . Kelsey on the couch, painting with the girls at the dining room table. Strong: Kelsey, pictured, underwent chemotherapy while she was in the womb but was born healthy in 2011 . However, by August 2013, the cancer drugs she had been taking had caused a cancerous polyps on her uterus. On August 14, she had a full hysterectomy. A week later, she was back at home, and while her husband, family and neighbors had been helping out as she recovered, that day she was alone with the children. Taylor had been swimming in the family's pool before Mrs Ficks set both girls at the dining room table to paint. Kelsey sat in her usual spot at the head of the table. Behind her, against the wall, was a towering glass and wood cabinet. 'She didn't want to be in a high chair,' her father said. 'She wanted to be in a regular chair like her sister.' Just as they began painting, Taylor told her mom the family's Labrador retriever was soaking wet outside so Mrs Ficks slipped out the back door for 'not even a minute and a half' to towel her off. With the back door shut, she heard nothing unusual. But as soon as she came back inside, Kelsey was crying and walking toward her with blood gushing from her head. Later, Taylor, the only witness, told sheriff’s investigators Kelsey put her feet up and pushed against on the table, shoving the chair back into the cabinet. Mrs Ficks instinctively grabbed something to apply pressure before calling 911. 'Oh my God!' she screamed. 'My baby - I was outside real quick turning off the hose - apparently she fell back and hit the glass. She is bleeding out!' Later in the three minute call, she added to the dispatcher: 'Her head and her ear are cut in half.' Then Kelsey stopped breathing, and the desperate mother attempted to resuscitate her. Heart-breaking: Kelsey, pictured, died after she fell backwards into a glass cabinet, cutting her head . When paramedics arrived, they rushed Kelsey to Mercy Hospital Anderson, and a medical team worked furiously worked for 45 minutes before the toddler started breathing again. 'They had tears in their eyes,' Mrs Ficks added. 'They were crying, trying to help her.' She was then air lifted to Cincinnati Children's Medical Center, but tragically lost her battle 30 minutes after she arrived. Because of the severe head laceration, the parents weren't able to pick her up. 'She was so beautiful, laying there,' Mr Ficks said. 'Just so cold.' While they were saying goodbye, the paramedics returned to the family home and cleaned it until it was spotless. This isn't in their job description, but the squad didn't want the already distraught family to have to clean Kelsey's blood off the floor when they arrived home. 'Nobody should have to go through a tragedy like this,' Anderson Township Fire Battalion Chief Fred Buop said. Moved by what they had done, the Ficks' invited the fire squad to Kelsey's service. 'They were the last ones there with us as I held her in my arms and she died,' Mrs Ficks said. 'I definitely wanted them there.' The family is leaning on family, friends and their faith to keep them going after the unfathomable tragedy. 'She had a story,' Mrs Ficks said. 'She was an angel to us and now ... she's our guardian angel again. We just want her back with us again.' She added: 'It's been hard because you do question - after everything we've been through - your faith. But I have to believe she is up there. I have to believe she is safe and sitting in God's arms... And one day we will all be together again.'","Ohio mom, Shana Ficks, refused to terminate her pregnancy after being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011 .

"The grieving relatives of a British doctor who they claim was murdered in a Syrian prison have unveiled plans to sue president Bashar al-Assad. Abbas Khan died in jail in the country’s capital Damascus last December having written to his family in south London telling of his mistreatment by his captors. A jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing at an inquest, held in Britain, in to the 32-year-old’s death last month. The grieving relatives of British doctor Abbas Khan (pictured) who they claim was murdered in a Syrian prison have unveiled plans to sue Bashar al-Assad . Now his family plan to launch a compensation claim against the Syrian president and want to bring the country's authorities before the International Criminal Court in the Hague. Dr Khan’s family claim he was murdered, but the Syrian government has always maintained that the orthopaedic surgeon killed himself and was found hanging in a jail cell. Dr Khan’s sister Sara Khan told the BBC: ‘At the moment, there are individuals who wanted my brother dead and as a family we should be able to find out who these people are and why. ‘We want to take this to the International Criminal Court in The Hague and claim compensation from the Syrian authorities.’ 'It is a very complex case and it is not going to be easy, it might take many years.' Dr Khan was detained just days after travelling to Syria having made the dangerous journey with the intention of helping victims of the war. Dr Khan’s family (pictured) claim he was murdered, but the Syrian government has always maintained that the orthopaedic surgeon killed himself and was found hanging in a jail cell . An inquest heard how Dr Khan's mother, Fatima Khan, travelled to the war-town country alone in July last year, where she risked her life in  Damascus to find out which prison was holding him . An inquest in London heard how his mother, Fatima Khan, travelled to the war-town country alone in July last year, where she risked her life in  Damascus to find out which prison was holding him. Mrs Khan, who did not speak any Arabic, went from embassy to embassies and prisons - armed only with chocolates and a photo of her son. Some of the buildings she went to were shaken by bomb blasts, and vans she travelled in came under sniper fire. At the end of July, she saw her son at the Court of Terrorism, where she told him, 'Mummy is here for you', before she threw herself at the judge's feet - begging him for mercy. But in the end, her efforts were not enough to save her 'angelic' child. Grieving: A funeral service for Dr Khan was held at The London Central Mosque last December . On the day of his death she was taken by armed men to a high-security prison in Damascus and told Dr Khan was fine when he was given breakfast. But, two hours later, he was found unwell with foam coming out of his mouth, and a doctor was checking on him. During a two-week hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, the jury of seven men and four women heard there was no evidence that Dr Khan, who was captured in Aleppo in November 2012 after travelling from Turkey, had gone to Syria to fight. The jury said the medical cause of Dr Khan's death was 'unascertained’. Dr Khan died on December 16, 2013 in an ‘unknown prison or place of detention’ in Damascus, it said.","Abbas Khan died in jail in Syria last December after telling of mistreatment .

"More than twice as many voters trust the Tories with the economy than Labour, a new poll has revealed. Over the past six months the proportion who think David Cameron’s party has the best policies for the economy has soared from 35 to 45 per cent, the pollsters Ipsos Mori found. This is 25 per cent more than those who believe Ed Miliband’s Labour is best on the economy. But Mr Cameron has lost the Conservative lead on European and immigration policies - with UKIP now seen as the best party to deal with these issues. At the same time. the proportion of voters citing immigration as the most important issue has doubled to 30 per cent since 2010. The Tories have a clear lead on the most important issue for voters - the economy. But it is behind on immigration and the NHS . The economy remains the most important issue for voters, ahead of immigration, healthcare and education . The same poll revealed that the economy was seen as the more important issue for the public when making up their mind who to vote for. Managing the economy is seen as the most important issue by 31 per cent of the public. This is just ahead of immigration and healthcare. Immigration has jumped from fourth to second place in the table of most-important issues – with health and education down to third and fourth places respectively. Welfare is the fifth most important issue, overtaking tax, crime and unemployment. While the Tories are seen as the best party on the economy, they are narrowly behind UKIP on immigration – and way behind Labour on health. The proportion of voters who say UKIP has the best policies on immigration has almost doubled over the past year. In September 11 per cent said Nigel Farage’s party had the best policies on immigration – but this has surged to 20 per cent. The Conservatives are seen by just 19 per cent as having the best policies – down three percent. Labour is backed by 18 per cent on the issue. Ed Miliband is backed by voters on health, education and benefits - but Mr Cameron is way ahead on the economy . UKIP are also ahead on European policies – with just under a quarter support Mr Farage’s stance. Just one in five Back Mr Cameron on the EU meanwhile. Labour is ahead on three of the top five issues, health, education and benefits. Gideon Skinner, of Ipsos MORI, said: ‘We’re in the extraordinary situation of having three issues tied at the top as most important to the public, and a different party making the running on each — the Conservatives on the economy, UKIP on immigration, and Labour on healthcare. ‘So all the parties have their signal issue, but it means going into party conferences season there is still all to play for.’ The same pollsters last week found the Tories had retaken the lead in the polls ahead of Labour, just eight months before the general election in May. The Conservatives were backed by 34 per cent of those who say they are certain to vote in next year's general election against 33 per cent for Labour. UKIP meanwhile is on 15 per cent and Liberal Democrats just 7 per cent. David Cameron's Tories have inched ahead of Labour just eight months before the next general election . It means the Tories are ahead of Labour for the first time since December 2011 in the Ipsos MORI surveys. Nigel Farage's bid to shake off the ‘wasted vote’ tag received a boost, as the number agreeing that backing Ukip at a general election amounted to throwing away your vote has declined from 57 per cent to 50 per cent since May. Over half - 53 per cent - of those questioned said the eurosceptic party was raising important issues that other parties were not taking seriously enough, and 14 per cent said they would like their local MP to defect to Ukip.","Tories enjoys 25% lead over Labour on party with best economic policies .

"The lawyers for a 35-year-old former Michigan high school tutor accused of having a sexual relationship with a student are trying to prove the teenager 'stalked, coerced and brutalized' the woman into sleeping with him. The boy, who was 15 when he allegedly had a short but intense fling with Abigail Simon over spring in 2013, will undergo two days of cross-examination. In that time he will be pressed on the more than 1,000 text messages exchanged between himself and Simon as the defense attempt to show he was no victim. However the prosecution plan to use the same texts to depict Simon as a predator who went after an innocent virgin, according to M Live. Charged: Abigail Simon, a 35-year-old math tutor, is on trial for allegedly having sex with a 15-year-old male student .

Simon and the alleged victim referred to each other in pet names, the teen testified Monday. He said Simon called him 'boo' and he called his former tutor 'baby girl', according to Wood TV. The teen - now 17 - said their relationship was consensual and that they both knew it was wrong. One of the texts from Simon to the boy read: 'I’m scared that you’re only 15.' Arrested: Abigail Simon is seen here in a booking photo after being arrested for allegedly having sex with a 15-year-old boy last year .

Prosecutors read a text from Simon that she sent while on spring break in Florida, Wood TV reported. Simon told the teen he should be with girls his age, saying: 'I’m just too old, as much as that stinks.' However the victim refused, begging Simon in another text: 'Please give me one more chance.'

"A female genital mutilation (FGM) campaigner was left in tears after an experiment intended to assess the impact of political correctness on the fight against cutting saw 19 people sign a fake pro-FGM petition within 30 minutes. Leyla Hussein, 32, who suffered female genital mutilation as a child, approached shoppers in Northampton with the petition, which argued that as FGM was part of her culture, it should be protected. During the 30-minute experiment, 19 people signed the petition and just one refused - a result Hussein blamed on the all-pervading culture of political correctness. Scroll down for video . Horrified: Leyla Hussein, who was cut at the age of seven in Somalia, was left in tears by the experiment . Speaking to the Evening Standard following the experiment, Hussein, who also appears in upcoming Channel 4 documentary, The Cruel Cut, said: 'I kept using the words ""it's just mutilation"". They were like ""yes, you are right"". How can anyone think this is OK?' Warning that politically correct attitudes could hamper the fight against FGM, Hussein added: 'FGM is not culture, it is violence. 'Stop using the culture word. This is happening to children. We are human beings, we can't watch children being cut, I don't care what culture you belong to.' 'It is incredible that UK citizens . would sign a petition supporting child abuse,' Efua Dorkenoo, Advocacy . Director of Equality Now's FGM Programme, told MailOnline. 'It’s . time for everyone to stop worrying about being seen as racist or . stepping on ""cultural eggshells"", when in reality, doing nothing to . protect girls at risk of FGM is what is actually racist.' Shocking: A pregnant woman puts her name to the petition championing FGM as a 'right' that needs protecting . Campaigners: Leyla Hussein and public health minister Jane Ellison have both vowed to battle FGM . Female genital mutilation (FGM) is a catch-all term for procedures that intentionally alter the female genitalia by removing the clitoris, labia or both. Despite the claims of practitioners, there are no health benefits associated with it, while complications include severe bleeding and problems urinating, and later cysts, infections, infertility as well as complications in childbirth increased risk of newborn deaths. About 140 million girls and women worldwide are currently living with the consequences of FGM and 30 million are thought to be at risk. In the UK, an estimated 66,000 women are believed to have undergone the process and 24,000 girls are considered at risk. Source: WHO/UNICEF . She continued: 'We all have to work together to end FGM once and for all - particularly those of us who are in regular contact with children. 'Don't worry about meddling if you think a girl is at risk. You could be safeguarding her future and being a vital part of the solution to this despicable form of torture.' Hussein is now calling on Home Secretary Theresa May to take responsibility for drawing up an action plan against FGM - an issue currently shared between the Home Office, the departments of Health and Education, the Ministry of Justice and the Crown Prosecution Service. In the Channel 4 documentary, Hussein is seen attempting to secure an interview with May as well as confronting her own mother about why she allowed her daughter to undergo FGM. Hussein also spoke of her own experience of FGM, which took place in Somalia when she was just seven years old. 'Four women held me down and cut my clitoris,' she said. 'I felt every single cut. I was screaming so much, I just blacked out.' According to a recent study by UNICEF, as many as 30 million girls are at risk of being subjected to FGM within the next decade, including 24,000 in the UK. Political correctness: People are terrified of being seen as 'culturally insensitive' according to Ellison . The health effects of FGM range from . severe bleeding and problems urinating to cysts, infertility and . complications in child birth. It . has also been linked to deaths, most recently that of Soheir Fawzy, a . 13-year-old Egyptian girl who died earlier this year after undergoing . FGM. Although Hussein's experiment is the first time that the impact of political correctness on the anti-FGM campaign has been studied, ministers have already warned that peoples' fear of speaking out could mean suffering goes unnoticed. Last week public health minister Jane Ellison declared that vulnerable girls are being 'failed' because people do not want to be seen as 'culturally insensitive'. In an interview with the Evening Standard, the minister said: 'Because of that caution, bizarrely, we've ended up protecting the most vulnerable girls the least.'","Leyla Hussein, 32, left in tears after people signed pro-FGM petition .

"A 22-year-old woman is one of the youngest people in Britain to be charged with assisting suicide after the death of her friend. Milly Caller from Great Hale, Sleaford, was arrested in connection with the death of 21-year-old Emma Crossman, whose body was found in the flat she shared with her boyfriend in January. At the time of her death, Miss Crossman's boyfriend- who asked not to be named - claimed it may have been inspired by a Coronation Street plot. Scroll down for video . Milly Caller (left) has been charged with assisting the suicide of her  friend Emma Crossman (right) who was found dead at her home in January . He told the Daily Mirror  that the girls were obsessed with watching the series, which included a euthanasia plot featuring long-standing character Hayley Cropper, played by Julie Hesmondhalgh. In the soap, Hayley took her own life after a battle with untreatable pancreatic cancer. The storyline ran for several episodes before her death scene, which was watched by 10.2million viewers when it was screened in January.

Caller is the second youngest person to be arrested and charged with the offence in Britain. Last year  Kevin Howe was found guilty of assisting the suicide of his friend, Stephen Walker, in October 2013. The 20-year-old was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment after helping the the 30-year-old set fire to himself. Following her death in January, neighbours described Miss Crossman as 'happy and bubbly'. Neighbours were shocked to learn of Miss Crossman's (left) death, describing her as a 'happy and bubbly girl' Sue Price, 33, who lives on the same street, said: 'She didn't seem to be depressed or poorly - to hear there's suicide involved just baffles me as she just seemed so lovely, happy and bubbly all the time. 'She lived there with her boyfriend I believe and we used to see her going out with her dad. 'We noticed there were two ambulances outside the house on Wednesday morning but thought it was just something minor. ‘We never expected anything like this - it's an absolute tragedy, she was so young.' Adam Deakins, 22, who lived opposite the dead woman said: 'I knew her to say hello to in the street, It is a real shock. 'I saw all the police cars and a vehicle with blacked out windows arrive on Wednesday morning and I wondered what had happened. 'One of my friends had told me later that she had died and that one of her friends had been arrested. I couldn't believe it.' Assisting suicide is allowed in Switzerland, Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands, and some US states permit doctor-assisted suicide. But it is illegal in Britain and carries a maximum jail sentence of 14 years. In 2009, a Crown Prosecution Service change in policy set out new guidelines which took into consideration public interest in prosecuting suspects arrested over assisting suicide. Caller is the second person to be charged with the offence since the change in guidelines.

"A senior cancer specialist today condemned the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway as a corrupt and scandalous system used to free hospital beds of the old and sick. Professor Mark Glaser said the pathway – in use across the NHS as a way to ease the suffering of the dying – is employed by Health Service managers to clear bed space and to achieve targets that bring more money to their hospitals. The professor, who treated former Labour Cabinet minister Mo Mowlam during her last illness, said practices in British hospitals are ‘morally bad medicine’ and that he would personally ‘never be treated in a hospital in England’. Accusing: Oncologist Professor Mark Glaser says NHS managers use the Care Pathway to clear bed space and to achieve targets . ‘I would go to America because I don’t trust anybody,’ he said. He added that he has removed ‘dozens’ of his own patients from the Liverpool Care Pathway. The intervention by Professor Glaser, consultant oncologist at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, comes at a time of growing concern over the Liverpool Care Pathway. A centrepiece of the NHS programme for ‘end-of-life care’, it involves removing life-saving treatment from patients considered to be dying. Commonly, patients are heavily sedated and tubes providing nutrition and fluid are removed. Typically a patient dies 29 hours after being put on the pathway. But families have complained that loved ones have been put on the pathway when they were not dying and senior medical figures have said it is impossible to predict when a patient will die. Leading doctors opposed to the pathway have said it hastens death and that putting a patient on it is a ‘self-fulfilling prophecy’. Case and point: Rustie Lee refused permission to allow a Birmingham hospital to put her mother Euginee Edwards on the Liverpool Care Pathway and six days later she was discharged from hospital . Hospitals receive millions in bonus payments in return for hitting targets for numbers of patients put on the Liverpool Care Pathway. At the weekend Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt promised to reassure patients by making it a legal requirement for doctors to inform families when a patient goes on the pathway, and to obtain their consent. He is expected to announce changes to the rules today. But Professor Glaser said it was not enough. The 67-year-old consultant, who is in charge of radiotherapy at Charing Cross Hospital, in West London, said: ‘I would like to see a whole inquiry set up to look at patients with incurable diseases, and how patients can be managed within a time limit from the beginning of their pathway to really good pain control and symptom control at the end of the pathway. Reassuring: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is expected to announce new rules making it a legal requirement to inform families . ‘You can’t be just guided by admission rates and targets.’ He added: ‘There is nothing more intransigent and corrupt at the moment in medical practices as the hospice Liverpool Pathway movement. ‘It’s not really active or passive euthanasia, it’s negligence. But it is right that all the managers want the bed space and they will take down drips weeks earlier to get people out. That is a scandal.’ Describing the way he believes staff operate to put patients on the pathway, he said: ‘The average example is some poor person whose family is absolutely miserable and a nurse comes in, or a very abrupt palliative care doctor, and says they’re going on the Liverpool Pathway. ‘And then you get the treating doctor, such as myself, rung up by the wife or the daughter in tears, saying, “Oh no, we didn’t want this, we were baffled, we didn’t want to do it, we were bullied”.’ He said he has protested on behalf of such families and has removed dozens of patients from the LCP and put them back on normal care. He added: ‘Symptom control is right but taking drips from people, actually putting them on the care pathway, is morally bad medicine.’ Another leading critic is Professor Patrick Pullicino, a consultant at hospitals in Kent, who has warned of hospitals using the pathway to free beds and get rid of difficult patients. He has also expressed concern at the use of targets and financial incentives for hospitals. An inquiry into the LCP was started last week by the Department of Health’s End of Life Care Programme, which has been funded with nearly £300million since it was launched in 2008, and which recommends use of the pathway. A number of medical associations involved in end-of-life care, including the Association of Palliative Medicine, which represents hospice and specialist hospital doctors, will also take part. However, critics have called for an independent inquiry because the organisations running the inquiry are the same bodies which have been promoting its use in the NHS.","I wouldn't be treated in a hospital here, says Professor Mark Glaser .

"Shrien Dewani is a narcissist whose body language in the days before his wife's honeymoon murder revealed 'deep tensions' in their relationship, an expert claimed today. Analysing CCTV footage shown at his murder trial, Dr Denise Bjorkman claims the pair appeared extremely uncomfortable in each other's company - from forced embraces to scenes where a 'decidedly unhappy' Anni Dewani trails behind her 'uncaring' new husband. 'The bottom line,' she claims. 'Is that he was not in love with her.' Her comments come a day after it emerged his lawyers said they would apply for all charges against him to be dropped following a succession of prosecution lines collapsing. Judge Jeanette Traverso may rule next week on whether the 34-year-old businessman has a case to answer about his alleged role in the plot to kidnap and murder his wife. Dr Bjorkman, a behavioural psychologist, also accuses the British businessman of reacting to news of his bride's death with an 'awkward' response. Here, she gives MailOnline a running commentary of the couple's demeanour during Anni's final hours and Dewani's behaviour in the days after she was gunned down. Scroll down for videos . Shrien and Anni Dewani pictured on their wedding day just days before she was murdered on their honeymoon in South Africa which prosecutors claims was orchestrated by her new husband . Shrien Dewani wept as his trial was shown CCTV footage of him laughing and kissing his new wife (pictured) as they walked back to their hotel the night before her death . A passing car picks the attractive couple up in its headlights, as they stroll back to the five-star Cape Grace hotel from a nearby restaurant . 'FORCED ROMANCE' In the picture of Anni clinging to her Shrien in the car park, there is a possible scene of hope, expectations and desire for consummation and a love for which she yearned. But the picture also shows ambiguity on her side. She walks separately from him: note the distance of her legs from his, but her upper body leans reluctantly and awkwardly towards him. It is more likely he is pulling her towards him with some degree of force. This is reinforced where he pulls her by the neck for a kiss. This motion can be classified as an act of authority: Lovers don't yank their partner's necks. It looks as if there is Iack of emotional commitment on his side. Anni's final hours: Shrien Dewani strides ahead, hands in pockets, towards the Surfside seafood restaurant, in Strand - an unfashionable seaside town in Cape Town - leaving his new bride trailing behind shortly before she was gunned down on their honeymoon in a carjacking allegedly staged by her husband . Last moments: The awkward body language between the couple is clear even in the grainy CCTV footage as Mrs Dewani walks several metres behind her new husband with her arms folded . The couple make their way towards Zola Tongo's taxi before the fateful journey where she was shot dead by two gunmen in what the prosecution claim was a hit orchestrated by her husband. Mrs Dewani is wearing the short dress and high heels that she was found in the following morning in the back of the abandoned car . 'FROSTY RELATIONS' The loving clip in the street was the night before her death. The evening of their outing which led to her death shows a decidedly unhappy Anni trailing behind a purposeful Dewani who strides uncaringly ahead of her. This is very much a picture of an unwilling partner. In one scene, Dewani can be seen kissing Anni but we already know he is aware of the cameras and looks upward to confirm camera position in another frame. He almost throws her off balance and he can be seen to be thrusting his lips on her averted face. She avoids making lip-to-lip contact which is a very significant message from a woman on her honeymoon. The deep tensions in their relationship are clear. The bottom line, he was not in love with her as there was no consistency in his behaviour towards her which shows passion, sexual intimacy, emotional need. In  CCTV footage shown at the murder trial, Dewani is shown being led down the corridor to his hotel room with an arm around his shoulder while he holds his head in his hands, apparently in grief . As he arrives at the room door, Dewani appears to take one hand from his face and reach into his pocket . Dewani then brings his other hand to his pocket, then appears to hand the room key to his companion and walks with him into the room with hands in pockets . 'AWKWARD GRIEF?' In the hotel corridor where he receives the news of Anni's death, he seems awkward in his response and his body movements seem timed and conscious. When someone receives bad news a normal response is a gasp for air. The mouth falls open with a primitive shock reaction, an adjustment of the reptilian brain. His finely gym-toned body appears to be the only real tension on display. Bicep tension and size does not require effort. The human response to bad news is almost foetal with the body musculature collapsing in on itself as energy drains. A day after he is seen relaxed and smiling in the same corridor. Caught on CCTV: In one video clip shown to the courtroom, Dewani is captured leading alleged fixer Tongo down a hotel corridor to a quiet room, carrying a small bag . Evidence: The opening shot of the surveillance camera sequence shown to the South African court shows suspect Shrien Dewani walking through the foyer of the Cape Grace hotel days after his new wife's murder . Waiting: Dewani is seen pacing back and forth in the hotel lobby in the moments before Tongo appears . Follow me: Dewani leads the way as he takes the cab driver to a part of the hotel not covered by CCTV . 'GRIPPING ENCOUNTER' In the hotel lounge frame where Dewani is seen carrying a packet, his shoulders are hunched forward in an expectant position, suggesting purpose in his movement. By contrast his grip of the handle of the packet is tight indicating that it has value and cannot be lost. In body language parlance, this is called field dependence - hinting at gravitas being attached to something external. His explanation of a tip (for the taxi driver) in a bag is unusual. Tips are not traditionally given in bags. The norm is to hand over notes either opened or in a folded wad. Suspicions: Dewani is in a corridor of the hotel, checking his phone and clutching a white carrier bag . Retail therapy: The bag is from a shopping trip to the nearby V&A Waterfront. The Western Cape Court heard Dewani chose to shop for greetings cards instead of attending a Hindu ceremony to bless his wife's body . SHOPPING SPREE . The retail therapy pic shows anything but grief. His body style is relaxed and confident. This is the real Dewani. Shrien Dewani (left) arrives with supporters for his extradition hearing at Belmarsh Magistrates Court in May 2011 then leaves (right) after being excused because of ill health . 'NARCISSISM DOES OUT' Early footage of the good-looking Dewani shows his preoccupation with his image projection and he walks with the confident glide of a fashion model for GQ. There is an enduring trend of dapper dressing, sleek tailored attire and labels. His clothing fits his lean body suggesting that shopping is more than an outing. It is an experience. Soft boyish features and sensuous lips contrasted against a muscular well-toned body complete the picture. British courts are defined by respectful behaviour and dignified dress, the latter idea of which seems to have eluded Dewani as he arrives for extradition court hearings looking unkempt, eyes cast down, feet shod in trainers, dragging on the ground. Unpressed jeans or track suit pants are de rigeur as is his unshaven face and bomber jackets. This look fits appropriately into the depressed post-traumatic stress image he projected. But narcissism does out through the contrasting designer hairstyle and well-manicured slim hands. Shrien Dewani sits in the dock before the start of his trial at the Western Cape High Court last month . ATTENTION TO DETAIL . In the court room we see his unfailing attention to detail and his image with his sartorial elegance. His suit, shirt and tie are immaculate as is his designer hairstyle. Only the frightened, wide alertness of his eyes as they dart with involuntary speed around the court to take in as much information as possible is the giveaway. His breathing is shallow supporting the element of fear. Salacious information of his other life (with gay prostitutes) confirms his ability to project an image on command. He probably has endured a lifetime of living this double life so changing face chameleon style is not alien to him.

"Mistake: The UK ambassador to Chile Jon Benjamin has apologised for the tweet . Britain’s ambassador to Chile has been threatened  with violence by furious Argentines over a joke he made about their football team and the Falklands conflict. Jon Benjamin made the faux pas on Twitter to his 10,000 followers when he tried to send a private  message to a friend. It referred to a lewd terrace song often sung by Chilean football fans in rhyming Spanish when they play teams from the neighbouring country: ‘Argentines, gays, they took the Falklands off you because you are cowards.’ In a reference to the offensive song, Mr Benjamin, 49, boasted that he was attending a game: ‘Which islands did they take off who and for being what? Perhaps I’ll discover the answer at the national stadium. I’ve already got my ticket.’ The message upset Argentine fans, who took to Twitter to threaten the diplomat, who is in his first posting as ambassador. One threatened to beat him up if he ever met him while another called him a ‘clown’. One fan, referring to the Falklands by their Argentine name Las Malvinas, tweeted: ‘Football folklore is beautiful until people bring in issues stained with blood. This is an insult to all the Argentines who lost their lives in the Malvinas.’ Newspaper and TV coverage in Argentina was critical too. National sports daily Ole labelled him rude while a Buenos Aires TV station accused him of  disrespecting their nation. Offensive: 'What were the islands that they took, from whom and for what reason? Maybe I'll get to know at the National Stadium this Tuesday? I've already got my ticket.' Mr Benjamin, ambassador to Santiago since December 2009, also upset his hosts. Chile’s former telecoms minister Pablo Bello tweeted: ‘Your comments are in bad taste, ambassador. You don’t need to appeal to Chilean nationalist chauvinism to fulfil your diplomatic mission. Doing so reflects badly on you.’ The 1982 Falklands war ended with the Argentines surrendering to British forces 74 days after they invaded the isles. Mr Benjamin offered an apology on Twitter, saying: ‘I’m sorry I offended with a private message that I published by mistake. I feel great affection for my Argentine friends and respect for their national side.’ Disputed: The Falkland Islands' capital Stanley . A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘Our ambassador to Chile appears to have inadvertently caused some controversy in a tweet. He has deleted it.’  It is believed Mr Benjamin is highly regarded in the Foreign Office and has not been disciplined over the incident. Single, he describes himself on Twitter as a ‘West Ham fan,  Londoner at heart and Jewish atheist’. He attended Slough Grammar School before reading German and Swedish at the  University of Surrey. He began his diplomatic career in 1986 in Pakistan and has also been posted to Indonesia, Burma, Turkey and the US.","Jon Benjamin, UK ambassador to Chile, taunted Argentina on Twitter .

"They were born when George V was king, Herbert Henry Asquith was prime minister and World War One was just underway. Eric and Herbert Walton - the oldest male twins in the United Kingdom - turned 100 today and, as usual, they are celebrating the major milestone together. And they are sharing their secret to a long life: good genes and a fit and active lifestyle. Making history together: Eric and Herbert Walton are the oldest living male twins in the UK . Born in Gateshead in 1914, they were raised in the area by their mum Mary, who was left a single mother after their father George was killed in World War One in 1917. Both did their part in World War Two, with Herbert serving in the army on the ships and Eric making weapons at engineering company Vickers. Since then they have seen their fair share of historic events - from the end of communism across Eastern Europe with the fall of the Berlin Wall to the return of combat with the 9/11 attacks in the US. Eric's 63-year-old son, Chris, a retired headmaster, said: ‘They have both been active and positive throughout their lives, and I’m proud of that.' Eric (left) and Herbert Walton have remained close throughout their lives - living around 15 miles apart . Eric (left) and Herbert were raised by their mother after their father died during World War One . Their mother, Mary Walton, nee Rogers, lived until the age of 98 and their grandmother lived a year longer to see 99. The brothers have spent almost every birthday together and remain close - living only about 15 miles apart. Eric said: ‘I can’t believe we’ve reached 100, but we’re both happy about it.' Herbert joked: ‘He keeps me alive. He’s the only one of us who can sing.' 'When they were younger they would ride their motorbikes together': Eric and Herbert when they were 19 . Eric has three children, including his 76-year-old daughter, Ruth, who he had with his first wife, Winifred, who died at 28 years old. He then remarried and had son Chris and daughter Jennifer, 59, with his second wife, Mary. Herbert married pianist and music teacher Florence. Together, they had one son - Everard, 70. Between the two brothers, they now have nine grandchildren and six great grandchildren, with Eric also being a great-great-grandfather. ‘They’ve always been out and about and they are surrounded by loving family and friends. They are certainly the figureheads of the family,’ Eric’s son Chris said. Both brothers did their part during World War Two, with Herbert seen here at the front in Australia . ‘Although they are twins they are so different. Herbert has the go and get them type of personality where Eric was always the more laid back out of the two,’ said Eric’s eldest daughter Ruth. ‘I loved gardening and had my own allotment. I even grew an apple tree in the garden from a small pip,’ Eric said. Herbert added: ‘Eric always liked his gardening but I loved paintings, art and music. I was more into the academic side of things, and of course I went on to be a headteacher.' While Eric had 14 jobs in his lifetime, Herbert turned to teaching after the war and served as headteacher at Lindisfarne Primary School in Gateshead for many years. Ruth said: ‘They have always been really close, even when they were younger they would ride their motorbikes together. 'Both of them have led an active life and I think this has helped them to reach 100 years, but it is really strange for two twins to reach this together.' The men are set to mark the impressive milestone with a party. And just like most of their previous birthdays, they have chosen to mark the momentous milestone together. ‘We have enjoyed all our life and we’ve had some marvellous experiences,’ Herbert said.","Eric and Herbert Walton were born during the reign of King George V .

"A Texas schoolboy who was born without fingers on his left hand has been given a prosthetic glove made to look like the hand of his favorite superhero Spider-Man. Brandon Breeckner had just a thumb and four small stubs but now proudly imitates the comic book herowith his very own fully-functioning glove. The five-year-old, from Dallas, now picks up everyday objects with ease and he gleefully uses his new prosthetic fingers to help him count to 10. Scroll down for video . Super hero: Texas schoolboy Brandon Breeckner shows off his his new Spider-Man inspired prosthetic glove; the five-year-old was born with just a thumb and four 'nubbins' on his left hand . Unstoppable: Brandon's mother Shauna said her son's disability had never held him back, saying he was 'a phenomenal little boy and he has not been held back by anything' Siblings: Brandon and his sister Shelby, two, before e-ENABLE made a prosthetic glove for him . His parents, Shauna, 34, and Jason Breeckner, 33, said their son was thrilled with his new hand as was his little sister, Shelby, two. Mrs Breeckner said she and her husband were told Brandon was missing some fingers when she was just five months pregnant. The couple immediately began researching prosthetics and websites for children with similar hands to their unborn son. As the age of two Brandon had surgery to remove his four little 'nubbins', so he would have a better gripping surface. Mrs Breeckner said the disability didn't phase her son. She said: 'Brandon is a phenomenal little boy and he has not been held back by anything.' Family photo: Shauna and Jason Breeckner with Brandon, right and Shelby, pose for a picture . Mrs Breeckner said her son wanted to be able to 'count to 10 on his fingers, wear gloves with his costumes, and be able to pick things up' Thanks to his new glove, Brandon can now 'can button, snap, zip, climb and hang like any other child'. Mrs Breeckner added: 'He wanted to be able to count to 10 on his fingers, wear gloves with his costumes, and be able to pick things up. 'We are still tweaking the hand to make it just right, but Brandon is very pleased with the Spider-Man colors and black spider on the back.' Brandon was given the glove in October after his family were put in touch with Eric Griffin at e-NABLE - a team of volunteers who use 3D printing to make prosthetic limbs. She said Brandon, pictured striking a fighting pose with sister Shelby, 'is very pleased with the Spider-Man colors and black spider on the back' e-ENABLE designs and builds 3D printers, but Mr Griffin said the company soon realized they could put their equipment to 'use for a good cause'. He said: 'It quickly became a group undertaking as soon as everyone here began to see how much of a difference we could really make. 'It was one thing to know in an abstract sense that we made tools which give people the power and potential to create. 'But it was a very different thing to directly see the end results of what that creativity could really accomplish, and the dramatic effects it can have on both a child's life, and on their outlook for the future. 'We went from simply making parts to making a difference - it changed our entire outlook on what we can do as makers.'","Brandon Breeckner was born with just a thumb on his left hand .

"More than 200 people lined the streets in the eastern Indian district of Bettiah to watch as two monkeys wed. Onlookers cheered as the primates arrived atop a four-wheel-drive decked out with flowers, there to honour the wedding of Ramu to his new bride Ramdulari. The nuptials were even officiated by a local Hindu priest, who assisted the owner in choosing an auspicious day for the ceremony to be held. Udesh Mahto, the owner of the monkeys, decided to organise the wedding after the monkeys appeared to start liking each other. Mr Mahto bought the 13-year-old male monkey, Ramu, in Nepal. He later bought Ramdulari, the female monkey, at a village fair. Hundreds of peoples lined the streets, some even travelling from nearby villagers, to take part in the wedding of two monkeys in India . The owner of the monkeys spared no expense, claiming one of the monkeys was 'like an adopted son to him' No expense was spared by Mr Mahto for the wedding. 'Ramu is like an adopted son to me. I wanted to marry him off after it became apparent they liked each other,' Mr Mahto told local media. A band was hired, wedding cards were printed and a huge feast took place to celebrate the marriage, attended by villages from neighbourhood towns who travelled to join the festivities.","More than 200 people lined the streets of eastern Indian district of Bettiah to watch the monkeys arrive atop a decorated vehicle .

"A grandmother was branded a 'f***ing nut case' and told she had 'no rights' by policemen who pulled her over after she 'clipped' an officer while driving through a road block. The Victoria Police officers involved in the alarming incident in the Melbourne suburb of South Yarra in 2012 are now under investigation, The Age reports. The heated exchange with then 63-year-old charity worker Linda Milazzo was captured on camera by an officer wearing a body-cam and used as evidence in court. In the video, Milazzo screams 'I'm having a heart attack' as she's told to 'step out of the car' by an officer. Scroll down for video . A Victoria police officer was filmed during a heated exchange with Linda Milazzo . 'You just attempted to run down a policeman,' Senior Constable Kael Oostuizen said. The officer told her 'you don't look like you're having a heart attack to me'. Milazzo had in fact recently had a heart attack and started to yell out as the officer tried to get her out of the car. He pulled her arm and said: 'You shouldn't have run away, you know you haven't got any rights at the minute.' 'Please don't hurt me,' she responded before letting out a horrifying scream. Another officer is then heard describing her as a 'f***ing nutcase'. Milazzo wrongly cited a law which she thought meant she didn't have to stop for police. 'You evaded police,' the officer said. 'I'm allowed to, on the 26 November last year a Supreme Court judge found a ruling that you do not have to stop for a blue light,' she mistakenly argued. Linda Milazzo said she was having a 'heart attack' when she failed to stop at a police road block . Footage filmed by police showed Milazzo driving through the road block and she was given a six month driving ban . 'You see how far that gets you in court, not very far at all,' the officer responded, as Milazzo called him a bully. The footage was shown in Melbourne's County Court. Prosecutor Mark Regan argued police had shown restraint by not pulling her out of her car. But Judge John Carmody asked Mr Regan to 'imagine if the [chief] commissioner heard the full set of these tapes'. Defence barrister Alan Marshall said Milazzo acted in a 'highly unusual fashion' and that she regrets not stopping. Mr Marshall told Daily Mail Australia that although he wasn't shocked by the case it is 'terribly unusual'. At one point an officer grabbed her arm to try and get her out of the car but she screamed . 'You don't normally get the video of the behaviour... it's usually my client says this was said, but it's usually denied. This time it was filmed.' The grandmother was banned from driving for six months, put on a non-conviction undertaking to be of good behaviour for 12 months and was fined $1000. A police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: 'Victoria Police members are expected to demonstrate professionalism at all times and complaints in relation to unprofessional behaviour are taken seriously. 'As a result of the issues raised in this case the matter has been referred to Professional Standards Command for further investigation.'","Linda Milazzo, 65, failed to initially stop at a police road block in 2012 .

"A Chicago-area woman arrested in May for drunk driving is now suing county police for what she says was an illegal, humiliating strip search by four officers that was all caught on video. Dana Holmes was nearly three times over the legal blood alcohol limit when she was pulled over and taken to county jail, where surveillance footage shows her being pulled to the ground by a female officer and three male officers. The 33-year-old was stripped completely of her clothes and left naked in a cell alone, where she cried on the floor for several minutes before police tossed her a ‘padded suit.’ Footage: Surveillance video shows an intoxicated Dana Holmes, 33, being strip searched by four police officers . Arrested: Holmes was also taped as she was arrested May 18 for driving at nearly three times the legal limit . Pictured: Dana Holmes was nearly three times the legal drinking limit when she was pulled over in May and was strip searched by four officers . Holmes was transported to the county . jail by local authorities who made no note of any combativeness. Footage . of her DUI arrest released to the media shows her cooperating and the . local authorities made no note of her resisting behavior. However, Lasalle County police say local cops informed them she was ‘being  mouthy and causing problems’ according to the Chicago Tribune. It . is at the county jail where things take a turn. Holmes is shown being . searched against a wall by a female officer as male officers watch. At one point, one of her legs moves. Lasalle police say the footage, which has no audio, shows Holmes kicking them. Holmes . is then taken to the ground by officers and footage shows her being . stripped of her clothes by four officers and tossed into a cell. ‘I did not kick,’ Holmes said. ‘I don't know if I lost my balance or what happened, but I wasn't being combative at all.’ While it’s unclear what led police to strip Holmes, laws regarding strip searches are clear. ‘Nothing in the statute says . resisting arrest is justification for a strip-search,’ attorney Len . Cavise of DePaul University College of Law told the Tribune. The lawyer representing the Coal City woman agrees. Problems: Local police made no note of her resistance. But when she was transported to the county jail, police say Holmes was 'mouthy and causing problems' Resisting? Police say footage shows Holmes kicking them. Holmes denies it. While that remains unclear, laws covering strip searches are explicit . ‘It's not only a violation of her civil rights. It's also a crime,’ said Terry Ekl. Under Illinois law, a suspect may . only be stripped by an officer of their same sex and never in the . presence of anyone not participating in the search. Holmes . was put in a cell while still nude, where she says she cried on the . floor for two or more minutes before a male officer tossed her something . to cover up with. According to the police report, Holmes was told she . would stay there ‘until she sobers up and was willing to cooperate and . not fight with deputies,"" according to the report.’ Stripped: Footage shows Holmes being taken to the ground and pulled into a cell, then stripped by three male officers and a female officer . Legal? Under Illinois law, only an officer of the same sex may strip search a suspect and only those participating in the search may observe it . After she is naked in the cell for what she says is several minutes, a male officer throws Holmes a 'padded suit' ‘I was terrified. I felt helpless. I was scared and I lay there crying,’Holmes told WLS. ‘I just prayed.’ Holmes is suing the LaSalle County sheriff's department and the four deputies for violating her civil rights after her May 18 arrest and for inflicting emotional harm by stripping her without legal justification and says she hopes the officers involved lose their jobs. ‘There's a lot of people that get DUIs, a . lot of people that just make mistakes in life,’ Holmes said. ‘That . still doesn't give them a reason to do what they did. My dignity is . worth more than that, and other people's too.'","Dana Holmes was pulled over in May for driving at nearly three times the legal limit .

"Gary Lineker has been forced to apologise after accidentally ridiculing two Muslim footballers during a match commentary on TV. When the players celebrated a goal by dropping to their knees and bowing their heads in the Islamic prayer position, Lineker said it looked as though they ‘ate grass’. The gesture is often used by Muslim players to celebrate. He was commentating on Al Jazeera TV, which is mainly aimed at audiences in the Middle East and has a huge Islamic audience. Scroll down for video . Prayer position: Montpellier's French midfielder Karim Ait-Fana (left) and Montpellier's Moroccan midfielder Younes Belhanda (right) celebrate by assuming prayer position . Sorry: Gary Lineker has apologised after accidentally ridiculing two Muslim football players . Lineker, who is one of the BBC’s biggest faces in sport, has a clause in his contract that allows him to freelance for the other channel. The gaffe was made during Wednesday night’s Champions League game between Schalke and Montpellier when discussing the French side’s opening goal. He said: ‘A terrific effort from Karim Ait-Fana, who scored from just outside the area and then ate grass . . . as you do.’ Viewers saw images of Ait-Fana, 23, and Younes Belhanda, 25, adopt the traditional Muslim prayer position, known as Sajda. The comment attracted criticism online. One viewer wrote on Twitter: ‘Lineker’s comment about Muslims [is a] very stupid remark and [one of] sheer ignorance.’ Another said: 'I'm off to the mosque for Friday prayers shortly. Or ""eating grass"" as Gary Lineker likes to call it.' One tweeter said the presenter had 'no respect' while another said his comment was 'idiotic'. According to football website Goal.com, . London-based Imam Ajmal Masroor said: ‘The players are not asking anyone . else to join in their worship, they are making a gesture in thanks to . God – saying they are “eating grass” is outrageous.’ Lineker insisted he did not realise what they were doing. The 51-year-old pundit wrote on his website: ‘I’m sorry but I’m not aware of every player’s religion.’ The BBC said it was not a matter for them to comment on. The commentator, a former England and Spurs player, is facing a pay cut to his £2million-a-year salary at the corporation. Match of the Day pundit Alan Hansen has taken a £500,000 pay cut and Lineker is expected to do the same as part of an economy drive. Last month he and his wife of three years, Danielle, headed to Los Angeles for a break. Ouch: Gary Lineker leaves a Los Angeles spa with his wife Danielle last month wearing a plaster on his right arm after having a vitamin drip . Hols: Gary and Danielle were then seen getting into a flash black Mercedes convertible . Soon  after arriving he was seen wearing a plaster on his arm after tweeting that he had had 'an intra-venus drip.' Danielle may have been sporting the same . plaster but could have been hiding hers underneath her long-sleeved top. 'Pick Mrs L up from spa. 5 mins later I've got an intra-venus drip pumping in vitamins with a doctor who looks like a serial killer #lalaland,' Gary tweeted. The former footballer was seen on his mobile phone as he waited for Danielle outside the spa. The couple then jumped into their black Mercedes convertible, which they drove off in to carry on exploring the city. Lineker separated from his first wife Michelle in 2006. The couple have four sons, George, Harry, Tobias and Angus. The couple's 20-year marriage was dissolved in 70 seconds. A judge accepted that their relationship had irretrievably broken down because of Gary Lineker's 'unreasonable behaviour'. In High Court papers.

"Thought you kissed goodbye to being marked on your every move the moment you left school or university? Think again. New dating app The Grade has a school-style marking system that gives users letter-based grades depending how how well they present themselves, interact and spell, and on whether they send inappropriate messages. The scariest part? If you fail to get a D average then you'll be kicked off the app, or as they like to put it, 'Make the grade or be expelled.' Going back to school! New dating app The Grade marks people from F to a A+, if you don't make the grade you're off the app . The app's grade scale ranges from an F to an A+ and the aim is to weed out users who are unpopular, unresponsive and inappropriate. Sign up and you will be marked on three categories; popularity, responsiveness and message quality. Popularity is assessed on how often the person is 'liked' by their fellow users and the quality of their profile, including pictures and a brief description. Responsiveness checks how often a user is messaging people and how often they get a message back. Lastly, message quality assesses the characteristics of the missives people send, from whether they make a lot of spelling mistakes to whether they use slang or inappropriate words. Everyone who is on the app can see your grades with your individual rankings pulled together to make an overall average. Dating apps are hugely popular with many of us finding love online through services like Tinder and Happn . Anyone getting C's will automatically be sent advice from The Grade telling them how to improve their performance in a bid to help them avoid from being expelled. The app works in a similar way to  Tinder by allowing users to pull information and pictures from their Facebook profile in order to create their account. However, if you click on someone's picture and don't like the grade that you see then you can use the back option, effectively un-doing your 'like'. Clifford Lerner, CEO of Snap Interactive - the company who developed that app, explained: 'Although mobile dating apps have exploded in popularity, feedback has painted a picture of horrific user experiences. 'We believe mobile daters deserve a superior experience and decided to create The Grade to eliminate the inappropriate, hostile and undesirable singles that currently taint the mobile dating pool.' Just like Tinder if you like someone The Grade will tell you it's a match (left). You will also be told their message quality grade so you have a good idea of what to expect (right) The Grade first came into conception after a survey of 1,000 mobile dating app users found that a lot of people were unhappy with the services they were being offered and the other people using them. The study found that 73 percent of women using dating apps had received an inappropriate photograph and 77 percent had been asked to send nude pictures themselves. A huge 90 per cent had received sexually suggestive messages and - most importantly to the makers of The Grade - an almost conclusive 91 percent said that they wished that there was a dating service that would remove or filter out those types of users. An example of how Singled Out works. A woman posts a picture of herself and asks a question, men are then invited to answer her . Recently a number of apps have been launched with a similar intentions to The Grade. Singled Out allows women to have all the control by posing one of 200 questions to their potential  suitors, they then have the option to speak with the men whose answers they like. Mesh is another app that filters messages by picking up on those that swear or use other crude, sexual words. Then there is Siren, which keeps your picture private until you feel comfortable to release it to your match. Looks like it won't be long until creepy online dating behaviour is a thing of the past!","Users are marked on popularity, responsiveness and message quality .

"Guilty: Soldier Warren Butler, 19, posted the offensive comment after drinking ten lagers while off duty . A young soldier has avoided jail over a ‘disgusting’ Facebook post about the death of three-year-old Mikaeel Kular because he was ‘brought up in a racist family’. Warren Butler, 19, of Carlisle, Cumbria, admitted to posting: ‘F****** LOL to that P*** found dead, One down many more to go,’ as his Facebook status on January 18, the day after Mikaeel was found dead in Fife, Scotland. The Grenadier Guardsman had drunk ten bottles of Stella lager before posting the comment, a court heard today. Although Butler claims not to be ‘actively racist’, the defence said he did not know better as he had grown up in a racist family where he was taught to feel adverse towards non-white people. He made the comment about three-year-old Mikaeel Kular whose body was found in Fife on January 17, one day after he was reported missing from his home in the Drylaw area of Edinburgh. A national appeal following his disappearance saw hundreds of people join police, coastguards and expert rescue teams to search for him. His mother, Rosdeep Kular, 33, has been charged with his murder. Butler pleaded guilty last month to sending by public electronic communications network a message that was grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character. A judge today branded Butler’s comments ‘despicable’ and ‘appalling’ and handed the guardsman a 16 week suspended prison sentence. Serena Edwards, prosecuting, told Basingstoke Magistrates’ Court that Butler, who is based at Aldershot, Hampshire, had become concerned for the well-being of his family and contacted police after his comment went viral. Ms Edwards said that in interview, he told police he had attended EDL marches in the past and had a racist background. She added that he also made comments about people of Eastern European backgrounds. Offensive: The Facebook status, posted the day after Mikaeel Kular's body was found in Fife, Scotland, was branded 'disgusting' by a judge . Ms Edwards said: ‘He said that he is from a racist background but not actively racist, he stated that if he knew the consequences he wouldn’t have posted the comments.’ Fabienne Macey, defending, said that the defendant, who was wearing full ceremonial uniform in his profile picture, deleted the comment and his Facebook account after he realised the impact of it, which had led to him receiving death threats. She said: ‘He has grown up in a racist family, his father and grandfather were actively racist. He has been brought up not to like people of a different race and that is all he has known until being 19 years old and recently joining the Army. ‘In the small community of Carlisle if he was to make such a comment, he doesn’t think it would get the same reaction in that community, which gives an idea of the extent of the racism in that small community.’ She added: ‘He has gone from a very sheltered insular background growing up to the professional Army job he has entered into. His maturity hasn’t caught up with his job role otherwise he would know as an ambassador for the country he can never say what he has said.’ Speaking in support of Butler, his platoon commander Captain James Stafford Allen said that the defendant had spent the past eight weeks under curfew with limited contact with his colleagues and he had been banned from accessing his mobile phone and the internet. Tragedy: Mikaeel Kular, whose disappearance became nationwide news after he was reported missing from his home in Edinburgh, was found dead in Fife on January 17 this year . He said: ‘Prior to this incident Butler did have a clean slate within the Army and was following a promising career as a guardsman. ‘Since the incident he has been kept in camp for eight weeks which in itself is a bit of a punishment. I have noticed him showing signs of remorse, he does truly regret what he has done.’ He said the Army would consider Butler’s position in its ranks following the sentencing. Sentencing Butler to a 16-week prison sentence suspended for 18 months and 250 hours community service, District Judge Philip Gillibrand said: ‘Everybody has said what a despicable thing this was to do and I agree wholeheartedly. Not 'actively racist': The court heard that Butler had grown up in a racist family and that they had taught him the values expressed in his Facebook comment . ‘Those comments were in respect of a young child who had so tragically lost his life and in terms of the impact on the wider members of the family and also the impact it made across the nation - people were appalled at seeing this prejudice, completely unjustified, cruel and disrespectful.’ He said that he was sparing the defendant a jail sentence in a bid to give him a chance to learn from his actions which he said had been a result of him being ‘brain-washed’ by propaganda and by his upbringing. He added that Butler had brought disgrace upon the British Army. He said: ‘To post this Facebook entry with you standing there in your full ceremonial uniform was a great disgrace and brought the Army into tremendous disrepute.’ Butler was also ordered to pay £85 court costs and a £80 victim surcharge and complete a 12-month supervision order which would include, diversity awareness and prejudice training as well as alcohol awareness. Speaking after the hearing, Kate Brown, chief prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service Wessex, said: ‘The disappearance and the tragic discovery of the body of the little boy shocked many of us and it is therefore very difficult to understand how a 19-year-old is capable of making such cruel and disrespectful comments. ‘Basingstoke Magistrates’ Court heard today how, as soon as Butler posted this message he and his family received death threats. The chain of command of Butler’s regiment was alerted and advised him to contact Hampshire Constabulary. ‘Whilst he was interviewed by Hampshire Constabulary officers, Butler explained how he shared extreme rightwing ideology and that being racist was his opinion and that he did not think that his comments were bad. ‘He also said to them that he only regretted the backlash it caused to his family. ‘The DPP’s guidance on cases involving social media makes clear that the threshold for prosecuting these cases is high and must be balanced against the right to freedom of speech. ‘However, where there is sufficient evidence for this threshold to be met, and it is in the public interest to do so, we will vigorously prosecute.’","Warren Butler, 19, was given a suspended sentence over comment .

"Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond finally resigned as Scottish First Minister today - but will not be replaced until after cheering on Scotland  against the English in tonight's crunch football match in Glasgow. Mr Salmond officially stood down in a statement to Holyrood this afternoon, paving the way for new SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon to take over tomorrow. In his last engagement as First Minister, Mr Salmond will attend tonight's clash with the Auld Enemy at Celtic's Parkhead stadium in Glasgow. Alex Salmond delivered his formal resignation statement as First Minister of Scotland in Holyrood today . After standing down he embraced his replacement Nicola Sturgeon, who will take up her position tomorrow . During a statement at the Scottish Parliament, Mr Salmond said it had been ‘the privilege of his life’ to serve in the role for the past seven-and-a-half years. Mr Salmond received a standing ovation from MSPs after delivering his final words, before being embraced by Ms Sturgeon. He said: ‘Any parting is tinged with some sorrow, but in this case it is vastly outweighed by a sense of optimism and confidence. Confidence that we will have an outstanding new First Minister. ‘Confidence in the standing and the capability of this chamber, and most of all confidence in the wisdom, talent and potential of the people of Scotland.’ In his final words to the chamber as First Minister he said: ‘Can I wish every member of this Parliament well, and wish everyone goodbye and good luck.’ He will remain in post until the start of Holyrood's business tomorrow afternoon, attending his final engagement as First Minister at the Scotland v England football match this evening. It comes after a new survey put support for the SNP  at 45.8 per cent, compared with just 23.9 per cent for Labour. It is the highest ever lead recorded by the pollsters Survation. The poll for the Daily Record will pile pressure on Labour leader Ed Miliband – after finding just 2 per cent of Scottish voters completely trust Mr Miliband. The SNP’s Westminster leader Angus Robertson said: ‘This new opinion poll giving the SNP our biggest ever lead in a Survation poll for both Holyrood and Westminster elections is enormously encouraging. ‘It reflects all recent surveys in underlining the strength of the SNP vote, and is a further demonstration that Labour and the other Westminster parties are facing a major backlash in Scotland.' England and Scotland will face off tonight in tonight's clash at Glasgow Celtic's Parkhead stadium . Mr Salmond announced his intention to step down just hours after losing the independence referendum. At a press conference on September 19, he said that at the age of 59, after 20 years as SNP leader and seven years as First Minister, it was time to hand over the reins. ‘My time as leader is nearly over, but for Scotland the campaign continues and the dream shall never die,’ he told reporters at the time. Since then, speculation over Mr Salmond's political future has led to suggestions he will return to Westminster, and he is expected to make his position clear in due course. He remains MSP for Aberdeenshire East, but he could stand for a seat in the House of Commons at the general election in May. Ms Sturgeon will be formally appointed as First Minister during a selection process at Holyrood tomorrow, and will be sworn in at the Court of Session in Edinburgh on Thursday. At the party conference on Friday, her predecessor hailed her as a ‘woman of extraordinary talent’. Mr Salmond said: ‘Nicola, your contribution to where this party now stands has already been immense. Your future contribution - I have no doubt - will be to make history.’","Mr Salmond officially resigned in a statement to Holyrood this afternoon .

"The former wives of two NFL players have revealed they were told to keep quiet about domestic violence by the teams their husbands played for. Mercedes Sands, who was married to a player from the Cincinnati Bengals, and Brandie Underwood who married a member of the Green Bay Packers, have told of feeling trapped in abusive relationships and how the NFL's culture of silence and inclusiveness left them feeling like they couldn't seek help. The women spoke out as the NFL continues to be rocked by a domestic violence scandal that began when video emerged in September of Ray Rice knocking his then-fiancée to the ground in a hotel elevator. Four other cases of domestic violence have since come to light. Scroll down for video . Mercedes Sands, who was married to Cincinnati Bengals player Robert Sands, left, and Brandie Underwood, who married Brandon Underwood of the Green Bay Packers, right, have spoken out saying they were told to keep quiet about domestic violence by the teams their husbands played for . Speaking to The New York Times, Ms Sands told how she started fighting with her husband Robert just months after they married in 2011 - something that soon came to the attention of the Bengals team management. In January 2012, Ms Sands knocked herself unconscious after driving her car into a neighbor's house while trying to flee her husband. Within days, the team's head coach Marvin Lewis chaired a meeting between her and Mr Sands, she recalled. He told them to seek counselling, but also advised them to reach out to the Bengals first if there were further problems, rather than authorities, as police attention would prompt adverse media interest. Ms Underwood, 28, who left her partner Brandon in 2011, said the wives of players often felt like the team was 'all you have'. She said:'Other than them, I knew nobody. You come to this town when your husband is drafted, and you get kind of pushed into this group. It is how you get your friends - your support system.' Ms Underwood said other wives told her not to cause a fuss, as it could affect the harmony and success of their husbands' team. They were to put up with Infidelity and even if they reached breaking point within their marriages, they were told to just keep quiet, she said. Ms Sands said to begin with, she kept quiet. She didn't call the police, and instead raised issued with the Bengals' player relations coordinator. He would take calls 24 hours a day, and sometimes defused arguments at their home in the middle of the night, she said. Her husband told her if she complained to police it could threaten his position within the team, and ultimately their livelihood, she claimed. Mr Sands, who is now with the Edmonton Eskimos in the Canadian Football League, said he had only ever physically abused Ms Sands and had never physically assaulted her. He confirmed her reports that the Bengals wanted to keep problems away from authorities. The NFL continues to be rocked by allegations of violence by its players, a scandal that was sparked by a video, seen above, of Ray Rice, punching his partner to the ground in September . But the club told the newspaper that they never told the couple not to involve the police, rather, they said the couple were told to work on their problems and make use of the services available to them. Ms Sands was just 22, when she moved from Miami to Cincinnati. The Bengals became her second family, she said. The team hosted her and her husband for thanksgiving and the Bengals later threw her and other expectant mothers a baby shower. But less than a week after the baby shower, everything changed, and Ms Sands said she became an outcast. In January 2013 she called police to report Ms Sands had choked her while putting his weight on her stomach. He was arrested, just one day before a play-off game. The support systems then went silence, Ms Sands, now 25, recalled. Mr Sands cancelled her credit card and emptied their joint account, she said, and during the final weeks of her pregnancy Ms Sands relied on food stamps and church handouts. For Ms Underwood, the ups and downs, happened daily. In one incident in June 2011, after they had celebrated the Packers' Super Bowl victory, she recalled how her husband  ripped a necklace off her neck and threw her out of his parked car before driving away. When police arrived Ms Underwood didn't say what had taken place, but according to officers she had said she wanted to make a point to her husband that he couldn't 'keep doing this to me'. Mr Underwood was arrested. An investigation into recent domestic violence cases involved NFL players, showed that in many cases the women, stood by their partners, even while they were being prosecuted. Ray Rice - In September video was released of the Baltimore Ravens player punching his then-fiancée to the ground in a hotel elevator. Rice was initially suspended for just two weeks, but as outrage intensified, he was then released from his team and suspended indefinitely. Adrian Peterson - The Minnesota Vikings player is facing child abuse charges over disciplining his son, four, with a switch. Peterson was initially allowed to keep playing, but was later banned from playing until the case is resolved. He continues to be paid. Greg Hardy - The Carolina Panthers defensive end was found guilty in July of assaulting and threatening his girlfriend. He is appealing the case. He has also been barred from playing while the matter is before the courts, but continues to get paid. Jonathan Dwyer - The Arizona Cardinals player was arrested in September for two domestic violence incidents involving a woman, 27 and an 18-month-old child. He is on bail and has been deactivated from all team activities. Ray McDonald - The San Francisco 49ers defensive end was arrested in August on felony domestic charges related to an altercation with his girlfriend. He was bailed and his continued to take the field for his team. The team's CEO has said he wants to see clear evidence of wrongdoing before punishing the player. A career in the NFL, on average, only last three years, something Ms Underwood said she was acutely aware of. If she spoke out, she feared she would affect her husbands career. Ms Underwood told how her life changed overnight after her husband landed a four-year $1.8million contract. She was then welcomed into the Packers' family and a life of luxury. But a week after the birth of the couple's third son, in June 2010, Mr Underwood told her he was being investigated for sexually assaulting two women. He later pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor prostitution charge. Ms Underwood said she was encouraged by the Packers' management and other wives, to stand by her husband. She felt trapped: 'They are more worried about protecting a team's name or player than a wife.' She made plans to divorce him the following year and left him about two months after the night he chucked her out of his car. Mr Underwood later pleaded no contest to a disorderly conduct charge over the incident. Ms Underwood then moved home, to a town near Dayton, Ohio, and began waiting tables. She did not hear from the Packers' again. The team refused to comment on the Underwoods case to the newspaper. Mr Underwood was suspended for two games under the NFL's personal conduct policy, although it is not known whether it was for the prostitution charge or the episode where Ms Underwood was pushed out of his car. The Packers dropped him before the 2011 season. Brian McCarthy, an NFL spokesman, said teams had offered a variety of resources to players or family members for years, including referrals for counseling services. In 2012 the league started the NFL Life Line, a free, confidential phone consultation service to assist current and former players, as well as coaches and family members.","The NFL continues to be rocked by a domestic violence scandal .

"Secrecy: Poppi Worthington died in 2012. The council wanted to keep all facts about the death and the name of the child from public knowledge for 15 years . Facts about the death of a 13-month-old girl should be kept a secret because of the risk of embarrassment to social workers or police officers, a council demanded in court. Lawyers for Cumbria County Council tried to suppress all information about the death of Poppi Worthington on the grounds it would be unfair to reveal shortcomings of public agencies, it was revealed yesterday. Details of how the local authority pressed for the death to be hushed up to protect its own staff were made public as High Court judge Mr Justice Peter Jackson ruled that the facts must still remain secret, nearly two years after Poppi died. The judge said this was to prevent interference with any future criminal trial and to avoid identification of Poppi’s five siblings. However, the information blackout demanded by lawyers for Cumbria went much further and was aimed at protecting its own staff from criticism, according to the papers highlighted by the judge yesterday. In its call for secrecy in July, the council wanted to keep all facts about the death and the name of the child from public knowledge for 15 years. The council’s demands at a family court fact-finding hearing ‘would have had the effect of concealing for the next 15 years the names of any of the family members, including the child that died and any of the agencies concerned and the geographical area in which the events occurred’. The council’s legal submissions aimed at restricting access to any information warned that ‘disclosure of alleged shortcomings by agencies might be unfair to the agencies’. The continued secrecy over Poppi’s death in December 2012 comes against a background of a troubled police investigation. Police inquiries into the circumstances of the death are still ongoing. A man and a woman have been arrested, but the police inquiry itself is now under investigation and an officer has been suspended. The official reticence surrounding the case has attracted growing criticism in recent days. Poppi’s name was unknown until last week, when an inquest recorded an open verdict and a coroner described her death as ‘unusual and strange’. Demanding action: Lib Dem MP John Hemming, who campaigns against secrecy practised by social workers and the courts, said nothing appears to have happened in the nearly two years since Poppi Worthington's death . Lib Dem MP John Hemming, who campaigns against secrecy practised by social workers and the courts, said: ‘It is reasonable to hold back publication of information until a criminal trial is over. ‘However in the case of the death of Peter Connelly, Baby P, it took little more than a year for the people responsible to be prosecuted and convicted. In this case nothing appears to have happened after nearly two years.’ Mr Hemming added: ‘It is very clear in the case of Poppi Worthington that the authorities are putting all the effort they can into ensuring that none of their failings become public. As usual, they justify this by saying it is in the interest of children, when really it is in the interest of paid employees of the state. ‘The real interest of children is in seeing those employees held properly to account.’ Mr Justice Jackson said in the High Court yesterday that he would make a ‘limited’ order banning publication of information about the death. He said this was ‘essential’ to allow any criminal prosecution to take place without interference and without prejudice to the trial. The second reason was that if Poppi’s siblings were identified publicly it would harm them. The judge said: ‘I will consider whether the fact-finding judgement can be published as soon as it is possible to do so.’ Cumbria County Council said it was ‘unable to comment at this time’.

"Self-harm in indigenous Australians has increased almost 50 per cent in the past 10 years while juveniles are 24 times more likely to be sentenced to detention than their non-indigenous counterparts, according to a new government report. These were some of the findings in the Productivity Commission's Overcoming Indigenous Disadvantage 2014 report released on Wednesday. The report spanned 600 pages and also found there had been a 57 per cent increase in the amount of adult indigenous Australians sent to prison between 2000 and 2013, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. Self-harm in indigenous Australians has increased almost 50 per cent in the past 10 years while juveniles are 24 times more likely to be sentenced to detention than their non-indigenous counterparts . It was also revealed Aboriginals were over-represented in the criminal justice system as victims and offenders. But the report also brought good news, with more young people completing high school and getting a qualification. In 2012, 59 per cent of indigenous youths graduated Year 12 and 43 per cent went on to complete a tertiary education. It was also found Aboriginals were living longer, the infant mortality rate was lower, smoking had decreased and employment had risen to 48 per cent - meaning less reliance on government handouts. But the Productivity Commission report also found Aboriginals were living longer, the infant mortality rate was lower, and employment had risen to 48 per cent - meaning less reliance on government handouts . Between 2007 and 2012, the life expectancy of an indigenous male increased 0.8 of a year while a female's had risen by 0.1 years. Since 2008, the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) have vowed to 'close the gap' across six different areas, which covers life expectancy, mortality rates of children, education and employment. The report serves as a feedback tool for governments to see if their policies for indigenous Australians are improving their quality of life. Productivity Commissioner Patricia Scott told Fairfax Media the report demonstrated how essential it was to take a grassroots approach when coming up with policies as well as continuing to invest money in programs that had clear targets. 'There's a lot to be said here for holding governments to account,' Ms Scott said. 'We'd like to think there would be people who would turn around to the government and say ""Well done in this area, but what's the story here?""'","The report was released by the Productivity Commission on Wednesday .

"Disgraced ex-CBS News anchor Rob Morrison lost his cool on Tuesday when he called his local newspaper to complain about their reporting of his upcoming court appearance on felony strangulation charges. Morrison, 44, resigned from his $300,000-a-year job in February after police accused him of choking his Moneywatch anchor wife Ashley Morrison in a 'drunken rage'. Local Connecticut newspaper The Darien Times reported that Morrison was due in court on Tuesday, April 30, but his appearance has been put back until May 21. Disgraced ex-CBS News anchor Rob Morrison has agreed to a plea deal that means he can avoid jail for allegedly strangling his wife, Ashley Morrison. The couple have reportedly been seen spending time together again . The newspaper has reported that Morrison grew increasingly irritated during the conversation and resorted to insults and foul language. He is reported to have used a ‘slew of insults and profanities to express his frustration at a story that had published that he claimed was “bull****” and “completely inaccurate.”’ The jobless news anchor also questioned how the 'shi***' paper got its information, claiming its sources 'suck.' 'You know every time you call my f***ing attorney, it costs me a thousand dollars?' he is allegedly to have said. When the reporter asked Morrison for an interview, he promptly hung up. Morrison has agreed to complete two domestic-violence programs, undergo a psychiatric exam, participate in substance-abuse treatment and submit to random urine tests over the next two years . Denial: Morrison denies allegations that he assaulted his petite wife Ashley, pictured . Rob Morrison called the Darien Times to complain about their story about his next court appearance. He said it was ‘bull****’ and ‘completely inaccurate’ ‘Your sources suck in the Stamford Court, and the Darien Times - I know this is big time for ya, OK, but your sources suck, brother’ ‘The clerk is your source? [The state’s attorney] you f***ing idiot,’ he said. ‘F*** the clerk.’ He claimed the newspaper gets its information from ‘whatever is f***ing fed to you on some press release or some form.’ ‘Good for you, bro,’ he said. ‘You know every time you call my f***ing attorney, it costs me a thousand dollars?’ He also described the newspaper as ‘shi***’ and hung up when he was informed the conversation was all on the record.

"For months  the awe-inspiring display of poppies which filled the moat at Tower of London has wowed the nation - while also tugging at the heart strings of the millions who visited it. But today the display was reduced to mud swept lands and seas of brown after volunteers removed the final flowers leaving nothing behind but a patch of trampled earth. The artwork, devised by Paul Cummins who also did work for the Paralympics, served as a site of pilgrimage for the five million people who saw it before Britain paid tribute to its war dead this Remembrance Day, 100 years since the outbreak of the First World War. Scroll down for video . Mud swept land: This was the scene at the Tower of London today as the display of ceramic poppies has all-but disappeared from the moat . Before: A team of volunteers has spent days removing the 888,246 flowers - each on representing the life of a British or Commonwealth soldier killed during the First World War . Gone: The flowers, almost all of which have now been removed, have been sold to raise money for the Royal British Legion and will now be packed and posted to the buyers . Memorial: Only two parts of the display will remain, the Weeping Willow (pictured) and the Wave, which rose over the walkway into the Tower, which will stay until the end of the month before touring museums around the country until 2018 . Each of the 888,246 ceramic poppies, representing the number of British and Commonwealth troops killed in the conflict, will now be packaged and mailed to those who bought one, helping to raise money for the Royal British Legion. While the work is unlikely to ever be brought together in its entirety again, the Weeping Willow section - which poured from one of the Tower's windows - and the Wave - which vaulted over the Tower's entrance - will stay in place for the rest of this month before being toured around the UK until 2018. Meanwhile Mr Cummins and fellow artist Tom Piper have been tipped to receive OBEs for services to the arts in the Queen's new year honours list. Mr Cummins previously spoke about how the memorial display was inspired by an unknown soldier from his home town and by a poem, the first line of which reads: 'The blood swept lands and seas of red, / Where angels dare to tread'. Seas of brown: A workman inspects the muddy moat at the Tower of London as volunteers removed the last of the poppies earlier today . Crowded out: Around five million people visited the display in the run up to Remembrance Sunday - with the crowds so thick at one point that Tower Hill tube station was shut - but they have all gone now . Special delivery: The poppies will now be packed up and sent off to buyers with the money being used to support the Royal British Legion . Easy does it: A volunteer carries one box of the ceramic flowers away from the Tower of London as the last of the poppies are removed . He was also seriously injured in the making of the work, crushing his hand in a ceramic roller, leaving him with no middle finger and without the use of his index finger. Among the visitors to the memorial were the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who came to walk among the flowers in August just as the display was taking shape. Also in line to pay their respects were Prince Harry, and the Queen and Prince Philip. Starting from July 17, a team of around 17,500 people helped put the poppies in place, leading up to Armistice Day when cadet Harry Alexander Hayes, 16, planted the final flower. Lest we forget: Cadet Harry Alexander Hayes salutes after planting the last poppy on Armistice Day, completing the installation . In remembrance: The artwork, designed by Paul Cummins, was inspired by an unknown soldier from his home town who wrote a poem which begins 'The blood swept lands and seas of red, / Where angels dare to tread' Permanent: The Wave section of the display (pictured) will tour the UK until 2018 when it will be given over to the National War Museums along with the Weeping Willow to form part of a permanent collection . Paying respects: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited the display on August 5, shortly after the poppies began being planted . Royal remembrance: The Queen and Prince Philip also walked among the poppies in October, as the display neared completion . Previously, Mr Cummins has said: ‘I read through wills of First World War soldiers and came across one man who said everyone he knew had been killed. He wrote of “blood swept lands and seas of red, where angels dare to tread”. It read like a poem and it just seemed to fit.’ The artist, who is studying for a PhD at Derby University, added: ‘This is the biggest thing I have done. I am amazed that people have taken it to heart.’ Back to normal: A groundsman at the Tower does his best to repair the moat after hundreds of volunteers worked to remove the poppies .

"It may be billed as an ‘honest’ way to chat on Facebook, but critics say that an app that allows people to have anonymous conversations could lead to trolling.

"A former Tory foreign minister was rebuked by her party chairman after comparing the deaths of four people in a synagogue in Israel to protests at the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem. Baroness Warsi, who resigned in August over the government’s policy on Gaza, tweeted: ‘Israeli extremists storm Al Aqsa & intimidate worshippers – Palestinian extremists storm synagogue & kill 4 worshippers.’ Her comments sparked claims that she was comparing protests at a mosque to the murderous attack by two Palestinians armed with a gun and axe. Baroness Warsi was rebuked by Tory party chairman Grant Shapps for her comments on Twitter about the attack on the synagogue . Mr Shapps made clear on Twitter that Baroness Warsi 'speaks for herself, not the party' A British-born father and three American citizens were killed in the attack by Palestinian terrorists. They were slaughtered in a dawn attack by two cousins who screamed 'god is great' as they attacked at random. Victim Rabbi Avraham Shmuel Goldberg, described as a 'pillar of the community', was born in Liverpool and held a dual British-Israeli passport. Mr Goldberg, 68, is a grandfather who lived in Golders Green in London before moving to Israel and was a regular visitor to the synagogue. The others killed in the attack have been named as Rabbi Moshe Twersky, Rabbi Arieh Kopinsky, 43, and Rabbi Calman Levine, who were all dual US-Israeli nationals. The two terrorists were shot dead after the attack by police. Thousands of people attended a funeral for Twersky at the Torat Moshe yeshiva in Sanhedria early this afternoon, which was closely followed by a joint funeral for Kupinsky, Levine and Goldberg before sundown - the latter held outside the synagogue where the attack occurred. Baroness Warsi posted the comments on Twitter at 10.16am. SHe asked another user: 'r u suggesting there is NO link (nt justification) between murders in the synagogue & the weeks of intimidation & attacks.' Grant Shapps responded on Twitter ‘to be clear’ that the Conservative peer ‘speaks for herself, not the party’. He said: ‘Our prayers are with families of those murdered. No justification for terrorism’. Thousands of people attended a joint funeral for Kupinsky, Levine and Goldberg before sundown - held outside the synagogue where the attack occurred . Mourners gather for the triple funeral of Rabbi Kalman Levine, Avraham Goldberg and Arieh Kupinsky . A eulogy ceremony takes place ahead of the funeral of Rabbi Moshe Twersky . Baroness Warsi replied to insist she was calling for ‘justice for all’ rather than ‘hypocrisy’. ‘Both Palestinian & Israeli lives have been lost in recent weeks at the hands of extremists,’ she wrote. ‘Both David_Cameron & Ed_Miliband say a Palestinian life is equal to an Israeli life so let's ALL condemn the killing on BOTH sides.’ She also asked one commenter whether they believed there was no link between the murders at the synagogue and weeks of protest at the Al Aqsa mosque. The Al Aqsa mosque, on Temple Mount in the heart of the Old City of Jerusalem, is one of the holiest sites for Muslims. Temple Mount is also considered by many to be the holiest place in Judaism, although traditionally the Jews worshipped outside the walled area itself – at the Western Wall. In recent months, some Jews have visited Temple Mount itself, which has beentem fiercely resisted by Muslims worshipping at the site. Jews have had to be protected by armed guards as they tour the site, with some people believing the visits are deliberately aggravating the situation. Later, Baroness Warsi wrote on the Huffington Post UK website: ‘These murders must be condemned. I condemn them, as I have loudly condemned previous instances of Palestinian violence against civilians.’ But she said: ‘My successor as Conservative Party chairman, Grant Shapps, is only too willing to criticise Palestinian terror while refusing to vote in favour of a Palestinian state in parliament, and give young Palestinians hope and dignity. ‘Remember: the indisputable lesson of modern Middle East history is that violence breeds violence.’","Former Foreign Office Minister rebuked by Conservatives over Twitter post .

"Security guard: Kevin Baker, 45, pocketed £52,000 in benefits claiming he could barely walk while being praised for sprinting after shoplifters . A shopping centre security guard pocketed £52,000 in benefits claiming he could barely walk while being praised for sprinting after shoplifters and even running karate classes. Kevin Baker, 45, claimed he could not walk more than a few yards and was crippled with arthritis, even using a taxpayer-funded car, while working a 40-hour week patrolling stores at the Prospect Shopping Centre in Hull. He was exposed when an investigator spotted him at the shopping centre, his bosses later telling officials they were pleased with Baker's work and that his martial arts background helped him to restrain thieves. Baker was handed an 18-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work after he admitted three charges of making false claims for incapacity benefit, disability living allowance and income support between 1995 and 2012. He had begun claiming benefits in 1995 after complaining he was unable to walk more than 50 yards without experiencing severe pain following surgery to have two tumours removed. 'He said he was unable to work without severe discomfort,' Stephen Robinson, prosecuting, told Hull Crown Court. 'He said he could only walk 50 yards before experiencing severe pain. He said he suffered from arthritis. 'It allowed him the use of a mobility car from 2007 to 2012 which came from money he claimed. 'He regularly received letters saying he must not work. He claimed income support for himself, his wife and children from September 2008 to September 2012. He said he was unable to work.' Mr Robinson said that Baker had been working as a security guard since 2007, initially working for a firm called Keepsafe Guarding Services. The court was told Baker had worked at the Game Station shop in the Prospect Centre between 2007 and 2008, where his job involved detaining shoplifters, protecting stock and staff. 'He then started his full-time self employment,' said Mr Robinson. 'He was contracted in the Prospect Centre, Hull. Place of work: Baker, claimed he could not walk more than a few yards and was crippled with arthritis, while working a 40-hour week patrolling stores at the Prospect Shopping Centre in Hull . 'The evidence from managers there was he was running around after people who were thieves. He worked five days a week - six to eight hours a day on his feet. He had 15 minute breaks, but would rarely take his full break. He was on his feet for five hours a day. It was a physical job protecting staff and customers and he played a full part in that.' The court was told that Baker falsely claimed £28,490 in incapacity benefit, £17,068 in disability living allowance and £6,541 in income support. When he was interviewed in August 2012 he said that when he first made the claim, he was not able to work, but was later able to take on more. Court appearance: Baker was handed an 18-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work by a judge at Hull Crown Court (pictured) Baker said he did not like taking the money, but felt he had no choice but to work and claim. He said he knew he should not have been working. When he first started claiming benefits, Baker had run a Karate class at a church hall in Greatfield, Hull. He told his bosses about his martial arts background, but when questioned by benefits investigators claimed he had lied to his managers. David Godfrey, mitigating, told the court that Baker had suffered from acromegaly in his late teens which affected his pituitary glands, causing swelling to the bone mass on his hands and joints, and had taken steroids to ease the pain. He said Baker's GP told him that he should not have been working, but he had fallen into debt when he decided to buy his house. Sentencing, Recorder Phillip Kramer told Baker: 'You have not been in much trouble in the past until you decided to take benefits. 'It is a case where the initial claim was justified. But there came a time when you should have told the Department of Work and Pensions what your condition was. 'In your case there was a substantial fraud involving £52,000 and it was over a long period of time. It crosses the custody threshold, but I can suspend it.' As well as the suspended sentence and work order, Baker will also face a hearing under the Proceeds of Crime Act in 2015. Outside court, a former pupil of Baker’s at his martial arts school said: 'He looked as fit as a fiddle when I trained with him. He took karate classes and used to join in. 'He should never have had a disability car. They are for disabled people not karate instructors who chase shop lifters. He worked every day in Game Station in the middle of the Prospect Centre. Everybody knows him.'","Kevin Baker, 45, claimed he could not walk more than a few yards .
