"(CNN) -- Phil Mickelson did it the hard way. But the bottom line was that he came away victorious from the Scottish Open to end a 20-year individual drought in Europe. Mickelson beat South Africa's Branden Grace in a playoff on the links course at Castle Stuart in the Scottish Highlands on Sunday for his first win in Europe since claiming a Challenge Tour event in Paris in 1993. It was the perfect preparation for Mickelson ahead of the British Open that starts Thursday at Muirfield in Scotland. It must have also eased the pain of finishing second again at the U.S. Open last month. ""This is really cool,"" Mickelson, in his ninth appearance at the Scottish Open, was quoted as saying by the European Tour's website. ""It's important to me, and it's probably the biggest challenge of my career hitting the shots that are required here. ""To win here and to play well here, finally win on a links golf course, it really means a lot to me and it also builds my confidence heading into future Scottish and British Opens."" The highest ranked golfer in the field at No. 8, Mickelson blew a chance to win the title in regulation when he erred on the 18th hole. Needing only a par five -- he didn't drop a shot at the 18th in the first three rounds -- Mickelson struck a bogey to complete his round at three-under 69 and was 17 under through four rounds, like Grace. But in the playoff at the same hole he recovered, edging Grace by hitting a birdie. ""I was so mad at myself for mentally losing my focus that I came out on that 18th (in the playoff) pretty focused to make a four,"" said the American. ""I started coming here around 2000 or so and spent a lot of years here enjoying my time in Scotland and enjoying this competition. ""And to finally win, that feels great."" Mickelson and Grace were tied for second behind Sweden's Henrik Stenson heading into the final round. Stenson's two-shot lead evaporated when he fired a one-over 73 and he finished tied for second with Denmark's JB Hansen.","Phil Mickelson wins the Scottish Open in a playoff over South African Branden Grace .

"(CNN) -- There are only two multiple winners on the PGA Tour this season -- one of them is in top form ahead of the U.S. Open, and the other is Tiger Woods. Matt Kuchar moved up to second place in the FedEx Cup standings with victory at Jack Nicklaus' Memorial Tournament on Sunday, having finished runner-up last weekend at the Crowne Plaza Invitational. It is the first time the American has won more than once in one season, having also claimed the World Golf Championships Match Play title in February. His four-under-par 68 in the final round was crowned by a 21-foot birdie at the last hole which left him two shots clear of fast-finishing Kevin Chappell, who is still waiting for his breakthrough win. The biggest names in the field -- world No. 1 Woods and second-ranked Rory McIlroy -- were respectively nine and 13 shots off the pace after both carded par 72. For defending champion Woods, Sunday's effort was a relative relief after Saturday's nightmare 79 -- his equal second-worst score as a professional -- but he triple-bogeyed the par-three 12th hole that he had doubled in the third round. He also had a triple on Saturday. The American has won this event five times, but is struggling to regain the form that has already brought him four victories this season ahead of the second scheduled major at Merion in Pennsylvania starting June 13. ""You want everything clicking on all cylinders, especially at the U.S. Open, because everything is tested in the U.S. Open,"" he said. Woods is still four short of Nicklaus' record 18 major titles, and has not won one since the 2008 U.S. Open. He was eight over the card at Muirfield Village. ""It wasn't that bad today,"" Woods said. ""It was just one hole that cost me obviously a few shots. It happens, it happens to us all."" McIlroy is also struggling for form ahead of the tournament that provided his first major win in 2011. ""I hit the ball much better today. I actually putted a little better, too. A little bit of work next week -- yeah, it's not that far away,"" the Northern Irishman said after finishing in a tie for 57th. ""It's just a little bit of an adjustment and something I can work on and something it was good to figure out this week, so I can work on it next week."" Kuchar, who has yet to win a major, was delighted after taking home the $1.16 million first prize in front of his wife and two children. ""It's such an amazing feeling, this stuff never gets old,"" the 34-year-old Ryder Cup player said after his sixth PGA Tour victory.

"(CNN) -- Five key issues factored into George Zimmerman's acquittal Saturday in last year's shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin: . 1. The charges filed . Did the prosecution make a mistake in filing a second-degree murder charge against Zimmerman? ""I think the problem was they overcharged it in the very beginning,"" said Holly Hughes, a criminal defense lawyer who was not on Zimmerman's legal team. Had prosecutors started with the manslaughter charge, the outcome might have been different, she told CNN. But Florida State Attorney Angela Corey said the allegations ""fit the bill"" for the second-degree murder charge. Second-degree murder is defined as a killing carried out with hatred, ill will or spite, but is not premeditated. To convict Zimmerman of manslaughter, jurors would have had to believe he ""intentionally committed an act or acts that caused the death of Trayvon Martin."" A verdict and more: Get caught up . Questions surfaced about whether the charge was appropriate because knowing a person's feeling during a killing is difficult to prove. As a result, the prosecution had to rely on the evidence to tell the story of what happened and what led to the shooting, HLN's Ryan Smith said. Without an abundance of evidence, proving the case was difficult for both sides. Former Los Angeles County prosecutor Loni Coombs emphasized that jurors did not find Zimmerman innocent; rather, they found him not guilty. There's a difference, she told CNN's Don Lemon. ""They're not saying he's innocent, they're just saying they couldn't prove beyond a reasonable doubt, and therefore the law gave them no choice but to write 'not guilty,'"" Coombs said. 2. The evidence presented . Zimmerman's account of what happened the night of the shooting was a central part of the trial. He was the only living person who witnessed the entire incident, and there wasn't much physical evidence for either team to fall back on. Various adverse conditions played into the initial investigation that night: A dark, rainy scene isn't ideal for a homicide investigation, says HLN law enforcement analyst Mike Brooks. Much was made during the trial about why there was so little blood on Martin and Zimmerman, who said he fired in self defense because he was being beaten and feared for his life. Dr. Vincent Di Maio, a former medical examiner in San Antonio and an expert on gunshot wounds, testified that the rain could have washed away and affected evidence collected from Martin's hands. Attorney Faith Jenkins said it doesn't matter what a prosecutor believes if he or she doesn't have adequate evidence. ""Trials are not necessarily about the truth all the time,"" the former prosecutor told CNN. ""It's about what you can prove in court."" There was so little evidence available that the defense put together an animated video to re-enact the events of that night based on witness statements, police reports and Zimmerman's account, they said. The judge ruled against the use of the video. Zimmerman could still be held responsible for Martin's death . 3. The teen who spoke to Martin . She was on the phone with Martin moments before he was shot and was considered a key prosecution witness. But Rachel Jeantel initially resisted coming forward. ""She did not want to get involved in this in no way possible,"" Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump told reporters Saturday. During two days of testimony that was at times tense and combative, Jeantel described her conversation with Martin. When defense attorney Don West challenged her story, suggesting Martin attacked Zimmerman, she responded: ""That's retarded."" Jeantel testified that Martin told her he was being chased by a ""creepy-a** cracker."" ""This was a disaster,"" criminal defense lawyer Mark Geragos told CNN's Anderson Cooper the day Jeantel testified. ""This was the star witness, the star witness. The wheels came off and it was a train wreck. And there's no other -- there's no way to soft-pedal it."" Analysis: The race factor . 4. The voice on the call . The mothers of Zimmerman and Martin each testified that screams for help heard on a 911 call the night of the shooting were those of her son. Whose voice was heard on the call was considered key for both the prosecution and defense in proving who was responsible for the shooting. If the screams were Martin's, as the prosecution contended, Zimmerman was the aggressor. If the screams were Zimmerman's, as the defense said, Martin was the aggressor. On July 5, in a packed courtroom, the prosecution played the recording for Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton. When asked if she recognized the voice, Fulton said it belonged to ""Trayvon Benjamin Martin."" Hours later, the defense called Gladys Zimmerman to the stand, where she testified the voice screaming for help belonged to her son. ""I know because he's my son,"" she said. As a result, there was no definitive answer for jurors. 5. Testimony . The lead detective in the case, Chris Serino, was called to the stand by the prosecution. Serino told the court that he believed Zimmerman exaggerated the number of times he was hit that night but didn't feel any ""active deception."" ""Either he was telling the truth or he was a complete pathological liar,"" he testified.","Attorney: I think the prosecution overcharged the case in the very beginning .
Prosecutor Angela Corey defends the decision to charge Zimmerman with murder .
A lack of witnesses who saw the entire incident made the case hard to prove .

"(CNN) -- Breaking four ribs in six years has turned out to be more than just bad luck for golfer Brandt Snedeker. After another rib injury saw his early season form vanish, the American World No. 7 discovered he had a debilitating bone disease. ""It's something called low bone turnover,"" Snedeker told CNN World Sport. ""For some reason my rib cage doesn't generate the right amount of bone it should do. ""It boils down to the fact that I have brittle ribs. I'm now on medication to try and counteract it. It's been helping a lot. ""I haven't had any issues in the last few months and it's nice to get that behind me and focus more on golf."" Getting back on course, literally, will be a relief to Snedeker, who is targeting a big finish to the season in the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup playoffs -- which start this week with The Barclays at Liberty National in New Jersey. After winning the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in February, the 32-year-old was forced to take a month long break from the game. That hiatus interrupted what he considered to be a halcyon period on the golf course. ""I played the best golf of my career in the first couple of months (of the year),"" Snedeker explained. ""Then I got injured and I had to fight my way back from that. ""I've had some glimpse of playing some great golf again but I haven't had the consistency I had at the beginning of the year -- hopefully I can get back to that, I'm close."" Getting back to his best saw Snedeker clinch a three-shot victory at the Canadian Open at the end of July and climb to third in the FedEx Cup standings. Snedeker is the defending FedEx Cup champion and this week heads to New Jersey for the first of four playoffs. But with Tiger Woods, who has won five times this season, leading the tournament rankings from fellow American Matt Kuchar, the golfer from Nashville is under no illusions about his chances of becoming the first person to successfully defend the crown. ""It's going to be really, really tough,"" said Snedeker. ""I'm excited to be in a good position going into the playoffs but you never really know what's going to happen until you get in the mix of it. ""Tiger is leading that race and he is going to be a formidable guy going into the final stretch. ""But there are four tournaments and these are all great golf courses culminating at East Lake in Atlanta and it should be a lot of fun."" The FedEx Cup sees player accrue ranking points throughout the season with the top 125 taking part in the first playoff. The field is whittled down with a final 70 players competing for the $10 million prize purse at the Tour Championship in Atlanta in September.","Golfer Brandt Snedeker reveals a bone disease has been affecting his form .

"(CNN) -- It was a weekend that Brandt Snedeker and Hunter Mahan will never forget. For Snedeker, it saw him clinch a three-shot victory at the Canadian Open and climb to third in the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup standings. But the American benefited from the withdrawal from the tournament of halfway leader Hunter Mahan, who left the Glen Abbey Golf Club in Ontario after receiving news his wife Kandi had gone into labor. Kandi gave birth to a daughter, Zoe Olivia Mahan, and Snedeker plans to send the newborn a gift for inadvertently aiding his sixth PGA Tour win. ""Zoe will be getting a very nice baby gift from me,"" the 32-year-old told the PGA Tour's website after finishing the tournament 16-under par ahead of William McGirt in second place. ""I can't thank Kandi enough for going into labor early. I don't know if I'd be sitting here if she hadn't. ""But that is a way more important thing than a golf tournament. I missed a golf tournament when my first was born, and it was the best decision I ever made. I'm sure Hunter would say the same thing."" Snedeker is the reigning FedEx Cup champion and Sunday's win, his second of 2013, leaves him behind compatriots Matt Kuchar and world No. 1 Tiger Woods in the standings. ""It feels great to get a win,"" added Snedeker. ""To validate all the hard work I've put in over the past three months where I haven't played my best and know that I'm working on the right stuff and able to hold up under some pretty serious pressure this afternoon.

"(CNN) -- Two men -- two champions -- two completely different worlds. But for Justin Rose that's the way he likes it. While Andy Murray has had to carry the weight of British expectation on his shoulders since he emerged as a talented teenager, Rose has been grateful to stay out of the limelight. The golfer witnessed Murray's dramatic Wimbledon victory over Novak Djokovic from the Centre Court's Royal Box just days after his own triumph -- a first major success at the U.S. Open. While Rose has been able to progress quietly since bursting onto the scene as a promising amateur in 1997, Murray has had to cope with constant media attention and an entire nation watching his every move. For Rose, those circumstances make Murray's triumph even more remarkable -- not that he envies the attention which goes with the Scot's success. ""I think what he achieved captured the imagination so much,"" Rose told CNN. ""If I was to go on and win the Open Championship then I think there would be some parallels to that but I'm not always the great British hope. ""I'm now the highest ranked English or British player but there are a few of us. There's Rory, Luke Donald, G-Mac,"" added Rose, referring to Graeme McDowell. ""I don't feel like I'm the only one which Andy is."" Just as Murray's life will never be the same again following his Wimbledon triumph, Rose too must adapt to being a major winner and dealing with all the hype which surrounds such a feat. Since his victory at Merion, Rose has been on television screens across the world, had his picture splashed on the front cover of magazines and newspapers and appeared on countless talk shows. For a man who often likes to spend time in the background with his wife Kate and two small children, the hysteria created by his success has come as something as a surprise. The chance to get back on the golf course at Muirfield offers the chance for solace following a rollercoaster few weeks and Rose simply cannot wait. ""The Open has a special place in my heart,"" he said. ""To win your home tournament is the one you dream of winning as a kid. It would be my favorite tournament to win. I'd be grateful to win any tournament really. ""Winning in golf can be far and few between but to win this is what I dreamed of as a kid."" It was as a kid that Rose first shot to prominence -- finishing fourth while still playing as an amateur at the 1998 Open at Royal Birkdale at the age of just 17. His dramatic chip at the 18th from 50 yards went down in Open folklore although Rose admits his memories of the incident are somewhat vague. ""I've watched it and turned up the volume on the 18th to recreate the roar,"" he said. ""I wish my memory was better. I went numb. It was a crazy way to finish and I don't think I could take it all in. ""I was so young at the time. There was an embarrassed look up to the sky with me thinking, 'what have i just done?' tThat was my reaction with it. ""I've always said that to surpass that achievement I'd have to go on and win the Open. Maybe winning the U.S. Open has done that but I have had a very special relationship with the Open. ""Hopefully that will end up with the Claret Jug,"" added Rose, referring to the iconic Open trophy . Following his success at the Open back in 1998 where he finished one shot behind Tiger Woods and two off the leaders, Rose was expected to bloom. But after turning professional straight after his historic finish, Rose struggled badly, missing the cut in his first 21 events. Now, 15 years later, Rose has come through and finally realized the potential which so many saw in him as a skinny teenager. ""I always believed in myself,"" he added. ""I had to dig in and keep going. I was motivated by the fact I didn't want to be the one week wonder, the flash in the pan at the Open. ""Golf is hard and has many aspects to it. It's as much a mental game as a physical one. I've probably had the talent for a long time and people tell you that you're good enough to do it but you have to truly believe it yourself. ""And when you can truly believe yourself, that's when you can handle the pressure. In the past three or four years, I've developed a real deep rooted sense of belief. ""There was some scar tissue I had to cut down. Missing those 21 cuts was a traumatic start to my professional career. ""Then I had chances to win tournaments but didn't quite put them away and again confidence can be dented. It has been slow progress for me but I've got a good team around me. ""They keep me on track and together we'll put a good game plan."" With one major title under his belt, Rose will now turn his attention to lifting the Claret Jug and fulfilling a childhood dream. Ranked third in the world below Woods and McIlroy, Rose believes he is finally ready to compete for another major title. ""Winning at Merion has given me a tremendous amount of confidence,"" added Rose. ""You hope you're good enough to win a major, you think you're good enough to win a major but it's not until you do it that you know you're good enough to win a major. ""You never know how you're going to handle the moment. I always knew I would create chances to win but there have been great players before me that have had chances that have never been able to quite put it away. ""I feel fortunate to have that monkey off my back. I feel like I've only been ready to win majors in the past year or two. Hopefully now I've now got five to 10 years of good golf left in me. Hopefully I can draw upon that experience in a similar situation.""","Justin Rose is the current U.S. Open champion .

"(CNN) -- A key suspect in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks that killed more than 160 people has been apprehended, Indian authorities said Tuesday. The Indian-born man, known as Abu Jundal, was recently arrested in New Delhi, said public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam. ""He was a key conspirator, who abetted the attack and carried out the planning,"" according to Nikam, who did not say when the arrest was made. Investigators believe Jundal was on the phone coordinating the attack from Pakistan as 10 gunmen staged the bloody three-day siege throughout India's commercial capital. ""He was there in the terror control room,"" Nikam said. ""His voice was intercepted here."" While New Delhi police refused Tuesday to comment on the arrest, the Mumbai court handling the case has issued a warrant asking that Jundal appear before it. The attacks targeted Mumbai's Taj Mahal Palace and Tower and Oberoi-Trident hotels, the city's historic Victoria Terminus train station and the Jewish cultural center, Chabad House. Four convicted in Scandinavian 'Mumbai-style' terror plot . India blamed the attacks on Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, a Pakistan-based terror group allied with al Qaeda. The group denied responsibility. Indian forces killed nine of the 10 gunmen and later put the lone survivor on trial. In May 2010, Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, a Pakistani who was photographed holding an assault weapon during the siege, was convicted of murder, conspiracy and waging war on India. Two Indian nationals accused of conspiracy in the case -- Fahim Ansari and Sabauddin Ahmed -- were acquitted by the court in Mumbai. More than 160 people were killed in November 2008, as the 10 men attacked Mumbai buildings including the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower and Oberoi-Trident hotels, the city's historic Victoria Terminus train station, and the Jewish cultural center, Chabad House. India blamed the attacks on the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, a Pakistan-based terror group allied with al Qaeda. Authorities said Kasab was trained by the organization, which was banned in Pakistan in 2002 after an attack on India's parliament. The development derailed a fragile peace process between the nuclear-armed neighbors for about 15 months. Under American pressure, the two arch-rivals resumed their full spectrum of dialogue last year in their bid to build trust. The news of Jundal's arrest comes ahead of next month's meeting in New Delhi between Indian and Pakistani foreign secretaries. Pakistani diplomats said they will continue to cooperate with India on such matters. ""Pakistan has been in the forefront in the campaign against terror,"" a statement from the Pakistani high commission in New Delhi said.

"Moscow (CNN) -- Russian authorities on Friday seized radioactive material from the luggage of a passenger on a flight from Moscow to Tehran, Iran. The luggage, belonging to an Iranian citizen, contained 18 metal objects packed in individual steel cases, Russia's Federal Customs Service said. The agency said the material, the radioactive isotope Sodium-22, can be obtained in a nuclear reactor. The news sparked concern that the incident may have been related to Iran's nuclear program, which the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a report last month could be geared to produce weapons. Iran has repeatedly said its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes. Nuclear expert Michael Friedlander said Sodium-22 has no applications related to weapons. It is generally used to calibrate nuclear instruments in medical equipment, he said. Initial tests showed that radiation levels of the objects were 20 times above normal, the Russian customs service said. Radiation expert Paddy Regan, a professor at England's University of Surrey, said the material was unlikely to present a major hazard. He said Sodium-22 can be made in medical accelerators and is usually not produced in reactors. It is also not used in reactors as a component of fuel, he said. The customs agency said the objects were sent to a Moscow prosecutor's office that deals with air and water transport. A criminal investigation is under way. No details were available on the identity of the Iranian passenger, who apparently flew to Tehran on the flight. Iranian news media quoted an embassy official in Moscow as saying any reports that the passenger had been arrested were false. ""These false allegations are meant to destroy relations between Iran and Russia,"" the official told the semi-official Iranian Students News Agency. ""A month ago there was a misunderstanding about a university student who was carrying material used in dentistry,"" he said. ""This misunderstanding was resolved quickly and the student received apologies."" CNN's Jo Shelley, Alla Eshchenko, Danielle Dellorto and Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.","A nuclear expert says the material cannot be used for weapons .

"(CNN) -- For some people, Wednesday was a day to celebrate. Thursday, they get back to work. Advocates of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights say they've gained fresh energy and hope after twin Supreme Court rulings advanced efforts to legalize same-sex marriage. They want to ride that momentum for as far as possible -- making inroads on issues ranging from workplace discrimination protections, immigration reform to bully-free schools. ""This is absolutely historic, it's monumental,"" said Jody Huckaby, executive director of Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, or PFLAG. ""It may very well be that tipping point."" For people such as Huckaby, who heads a group with more than 360 chapters nationwide, what happened Wednesday was thrilling, but not totally surprising. Supreme Court strikes down DOMA . Yes, most states still bar same-sex marriage, many thanks to the passage of popular referendums. Yes, the federal government and most states don't protect gay, lesbian or transgendered workers. But public opinion is moving in the direction of LGBT rights. In the 1970s, polls showed most Americans believed homosexual relationships between consenting adults were morally wrong -- a belief that persisted into the first few years of the 21st century, according to CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. In contrast, the most recent CNN/ORC International survey shows 55% of Americans back same-sex marriage, up 11 percentage points from 2008. Voters in three states approved measures legalizing such unions in November 2012. Numerous corporations have adopted policies barring discrimination based on one's sexual orientation -- contrary to the laws in most states, where a person could still be fired if they are found out to be gay. Two of America's most watched TV shows, ""Modern Family"" and ""Glee,"" feature openly gay characters. Wilson Cruz had been a pioneer of sorts in the 1990s, when he played a gay teen on ABC's ""My So-Called Life."" California Prop 8 appeal dismissed . Times have changed since then, he said, as Americans get to know more gays and lesbians -- whether they are cousins, neighbors or characters on TV shows. The Supreme Court decisions striking down part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act and clearing the way for same-sex marriages in California could accelerate the movement even more, according to Cruz. ""I really do believe this is the domino that is going to tip over the rest of the dominoes,"" he said. ""Do not get in the way of this train, because it will run you over."" Same-sex marriage still illegal in most states . Teddy Witherington can now make wedding plans. He and his partner live in San Francisco, where same-sex marriage will (once again) be legal. Witherington, who is British, has lived in the United States legally for the past 16 years, first as head of the San Francisco LGBT Pride Parade and Celebration, and now as chief marketing officer for Out and Equal Workplace Advocates. What occurred Wednesday gave him pride to live in his adopted home. ""As an international citizen, (it) gives me so much gratitude because I see the very best that exists in this great nation,"" Witherington said. ""... It's truly a beautiful thing."" Historic rulings on same-sex marriage . Still, while he and other LGBT advocates characterized the court rulings as victories in their fight for equal rights, that doesn't mean the fight is over. Some 70% of Americans live in the 37 states where same-sex marriage is not or will soon not be legal. In his ruling opinion, Justice Anthony Kennedy said one reason the federal government is obliged to recognize gay and lesbian marriages that are legal in some places is because it is up to individual states to decide marriage law. That's more likely to happen now than a few years ago, said Michael Cole-Schwartz, a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign. LGBT advocates have learned to make their campaigns more about people wanting to be together than people wanting to get rights and benefits, he said. ""We have really focused on the reasons why they want to get married: because they love each other,"" Cole-Schwarz said. ""That's really helped change the nature of the conversation."" Daughter of interracial couple fights to validate her same-sex marriage . Workplace a battleground in LGBT fight . The Civil Rights Act makes it illegal for employers to discriminate against people based on their race, color, religion, sex or national origin. But not their sexual identity. That means, under federal law, there's nothing to prevent a worker from failing to hire or firing someone because they are gay or lesbian. Ruling opens doors for immigration for same-sex spouses . There are 21 states that do offer such protections, which leaves 29 that do not. In 34 states, there's nothing to prevent a person from getting fired if they are transgendered. Activists are working to change that. Witherington points to the Employment Non-Discrimination Act working its way through a Senate committee, calling now a ""crucial moment"" for politicians to change federal policy. The measure has 53 cosponsors, short of the 60 votes that bills typically need nowadays to pass if it's opposed by the Republican minority. If it does pass, it would then have to be passed in the GOP-led House of Representatives. Selisse Berry, the founder and CEO of Out and Equal Workplace Advocates, says she's ""very hopeful"" a bill that includes protections for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered people will pass. The larger movement in the society is a big reason why, she says. ""Any time people get to know us as human beings, it makes a huge difference,"" Berry said. ""More and more people, all the time, are coming out. When that person has a relationship with others, it moves the dial forward."" Map: Same-sex marriage in the U.S. Washington could take its cue from corporate America. On their own accord, most Fortune 500 companies already bar gays, lesbians and transgendered from being treated any differently than any other employee. Why? Because they realize the importance of retaining the best people who perform well on the job, irrelevant of their sexual identity, according to Berry. ""It's about the bottom line, essentially,"" she says. Activist: Gay rights' causes 'not insurmountable' Other issues are on LGBT advocates' agenda as well. They want immigration reform measures being mulled in the Senate and House, for instance, to treat same-sex partners much like heterosexual spouses. They want safer schools, so youngsters aren't threatened, hurt or otherwise victimized. Photos: Same-sex celebrity couples . And they are also mindful that transgendered people have ""not seen as many gains as the gay and lesbian portion of our community,"" says Cole-Schwartz of the Human Rights Campaign. ""The way the media talks about transgendered people is in terms of violence and suicide rates, but those aren't the only stories,"" adds Cruz, noting that parts of America still don't know or understand them. In other words, even after Wednesday's Supreme Court decisions, there's a lot that these activists' still want to do. Opinion: How youth led change in public attitudes on same-sex marriage . And to do it, Huckaby says, means harnessing ""the collective energy"" of people of all sexual persuasions who share the same values. That kind of movement could take place not just in the halls of Congress, but in stores and coffee shops on Main Street. ""I know the power that there is in individual messages from the people who are willing to speak out,"" said Huckaby, who grew up in Louisiana and has seven siblings -- three of whom are homosexual, like he is, and four of whom are straight.

"Hangzhou, China (CNN) -- Now in modern China all the constructions have become modern, everywhere is concrete and concrete in China means cheap. But my way is thinking about how I can use the concrete and the traditional ways so that they can coexist. It is very difficult now in China because there have been so many changes, the construction system has changed, it is almost all like the Western system now and the materials used have changed. So now, we talk about how to design a new Chinese architecture, but it is very difficult because tradition has stopped, philosophy has stopped and the Chinese value system has stopped -- everything is different. For example, if you look at Chinese traditional buildings, you will find they are not just about the solid structure. They have many outside spaces inside the buildings as people want to live with fresh air, trees, flowers and water together. We use the courtyard house in many different places: In homes, shops, factories, office buildings, schools, jails, everything. Going into Chinese buildings you can directly feel the difference between outside and inside. When you sit outside, you are in a very closed world; you wear a suit. When you go inside, everything is very delicate and there are very small things -- you can feel everything is warmer and more peaceful. The wooden structure is like your inner clothes so it is very clear -- outside and inside. In traditional Chinese architecture they use wood and not very good wood -- simple, cheap wood. Maybe the building will just stay up for 50 years and then it will collapse. It's not permanent. It is very similar to process of nature. I like this very much. Some buildings, they rebuild and recycle, again and again and again. And finally you will find maybe just 10% of the elements come from 1,500 years ago and the other elements are new. It repeats, repeats, rebuilds, rebuilds, again and again and again. It is as though the building is alive. In Hangzhou we have a traditional pagoda. When I go in this pagoda, suddenly I understand some things. For example, it is huge, but if you see it from a distant place, on some special day when the sun is at different angles, you will find that this pagoda just disappears -- it totally blends into the mountains so you can't see it. It is then that I suddenly understand how I can design big modern buildings using the traditional ways, how buildings can disappear in the landscape. More from Human to Hero: La Scala soprano: Opera singers are athletes . In China the most important thing is nature. It is not human beings, it is not architecture -- it is nature. So that is why I like Chinese traditional architecture. It means a philosophy and a value system. It is about how people can live together with nature. China has a long history of 5,000 years, so for a long time people have understood the meaning of the truth of life. For example, you go into the cities, you earn a big money, you become a powerful government official -- but that is not the most important thing for Chinese people. The most important thing for the Chinese is ... being beautiful about life, living in some peaceful place with trees, water and your family together. If you are an artist you only have to keep your passion alive for maybe three days or one month. But for the architect, your assistant, your client, the craftsmen and the construction company -- everybody is connected to your project. You have to keep the passion alive for five years, right to the very end. You become like a leader and everyone should be able to feel your spirit and passion. More from Human to Hero: Top designer shares secret of staying in vogue . When I design new buildings in a new place, I go there not just to see the site. I go to all the countryside around and see more than 10 or 20 villages. I take many photos, shoot movies and do some drawings. I read books about the area ... then gradually something emerges. If you really want to understand traditional Chinese architecture you should really know the craftsman's work because in China for a long time we did not have architecture theory or history, we did not have architects -- we only had craftsmen so the secret was just in the craftsman's hands. Throughout the 1990s, I didn't have any formal jobs. I just worked with craftsmen together for 10 years. I wanted to forget everything I had learned in the architecture school. The biggest problem for China now is not about the economy -- it is about the fact that people have lost confidence in their culture. Winning the Pritzker Prize has given people more confidence to like my work. Architecture has become too abstract ... (architects) are floating in the air and are not rooted in the ground. I do something that is directly rooted in the ground. I think it is more important. I learned many things from the traditional way but every single one of my works is in the city so I think the next step I will go back ... and do something in the countryside.","In 2012 Wang Shu became the first Chinese citizen to win the Pritzker Architecture Prize .

"OSAKA, Japan -- Tyson Gay sprinted into the history books on Thursday as he completed the rare world 100-200 meters double in emphatic fashion in Osaka, Japan. Gay crosses the line ahead of Jamaican Usain Bolt to complete a rare men's sprint double in Osaka. The American charged to 200m victory in a championship record 19.76 seconds, pulling away from Jamaica's Usain Bolt with team-mate Wallace Spearmon taking bronze. Bolt was away quickest but Gay took him on the bend before accelerating down the straight to win with room to spare. Bolt timed 19.91 and Spearmon 20.05. Gay, who won the 100m on Sunday, becomes only the third athlete to hold both sprint titles after Maurice Greene in 1999 and Justin Gatlin two years ago. It was a remarkable achievement by the season's outstanding athlete, who went into the 200m competition just 36 hours after winning his 100m showdown with Asafa Powell. Gay has competed on five of the championships' first six days and had complained of fatigue and a left hamstring twinge. The Kentucky-born 25-year-old finished an agonising fourth behind three US team-mates in 2005. But he has been sensational this season, blasting to the fastest sprint combination in history after timing 9.84 and 19.62 within two days of each other in June. The 200m time was the second quickest ever seen, 0.3 shy of Michael Johnson's 1996 record. Gay was embraced at the finish line by Bolt, who was celebrating his first world championships medal. Gay said|: ""Oh, it feels so great. But I am still tired. Maurice Greene is one of my idols and I am proud to do the double like him. ""Usain Bolt came out so fast and I had to work hard to catch him. I should be thankful to him to make this such a fast race. ""I stayed relaxed -- also about the hamstring -- and kept pumping,"" he said. ""I felt the twinge in the warm-up, but during the race it was fine. The 200m was just about believing in God that he would give me the strength. ""I have two golds and I want the third in relay. I beat the meet record of Michael Johnson and that is great feeling because he is also one of my idols."" Bolt, the Jamaican record-holder, has a history of injury problems, going out in the Athens Olympics heats and missing the Commonwealth Games with a muscle problem. He suffered cramp in the 2005 final and finished dead last. ""I tried hard, but for the moment he is unbeatable. I'm proud of myself to get the silver for Jamaica. Hey, I'm one of the best in the world, that is not small,"" said Bolt. Bronze medallist Spearmon, 22, was runner-up behind Gatlin in 2005 and last year ran 19.65, the fourth fastest 200m ever seen. Gay and Spearmon's coach, Lance Brauman, was released from prison on Tuesday after serving a year for embezzlement and mail fraud. Long jumper Irving Saladino claimed Panama's first ever world championships gold with a dramatic final leap. Saladino, the hot favourite, led all the way until Italy's Andrew Howe appeared to snatch gold with 8.47 metres in the final round. But the Panamanian responded with a mighty 8.57 to remain unbeaten this season. America's two-time defending champion and Olympic title-holder Dwight Phillips took bronze with his best effort of 8.30. Phillips, competing under the watchful eye of US great Carl Lewis, had not been beaten in a major championships since the 2001 worlds in Edmonton. South American record holder Saladino has now won 23 of 25 competitions since finishing sixth at the Helsinki world championships in 2005. The long jump provided one of the world championships' best known moments when Mike Powell's 8.95 broke Bob Beamon's 23-year-old record in Tokyo in 1991.

"(CNN) -- A suicide bomber attacked police officers and cadets outside an academy in Yemen's capital on Wednesday, killing at least 10 people, according to a statement from the Yemeni Embassy in Washington. The bomber died after being taken to a hospital, the release said. The blast happened around 1:30 p.m. at the police academy in downtown Sanaa, four Interior Ministry officials said. At least 19 people were wounded, four of them critically, the embassy said. ""Yemen will counter the evil of terrorism with honor and bravery,"" Adel Al-Suneini, charge d'affaires for the embassy, said in the statement. ""Al Qaeda today is not only facing the military and security services but also the fury of the Yemeni public."" Officials in Yemen said the blast bears the hallmarks of an attack by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. A Yemeni government official told CNN that the suicide bomber attacked as a crowd of people was leaving through the academy's main gate. ""This is as cowardly as it gets. These are cadets, not soldiers, not fighters,"" said the official, who requested anonymity. The attack signals that al Qaeda is trying to demoralize the police force and scare people from joining the security forces, the official said. ""But it's a miscalculation. This will actually encourage society, which has been cooperating with the government, to fight al Qaeda more,"" the official said. Wednesday's attack happened about 1Â½ miles from the site of a blast in May that appeared to be the deadliest attack ever on troops in Yemen. An affiliate of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility for that explosion, which killed at least 101 soldiers and injured more than 220 as troops prepared for a national ceremony.","NEW: Blast appeared to be work of a suicide bomber, who died at a hospital, official says .

"(CNN) -- On the face of Saturday's qualifying results, Ferrari's hopes of closing the gap on the all-conquering Red Bull at the Italian team's home grand prix seem as distant as they have most of this season. Fernando Alonso will start Sunday's race at Monza fifth on the grid, and a place behind teammate Felipe Massa, while Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber will have the front row to themselves. Alonso, 46 points behind Formula One championship leader Vettel, had appeared to make up ground on the German in the morning practice session but qualifying did not go to plan. The Spaniard had hoped to use ""towing"" tactics behind Massa to boost his lap times, but the Brazilian got too far ahead in the third session and ended up setting a faster pace. F1 interactive: Explore Monza . Alonso was heard complaining on his team radio, ""Felipe is too far away!"" -- and then reportedly called his crew ""idiots,"" though he said it was actually ""geniuses."" However, the two-time world champion later downplayed the incident and insisted he was happier this weekend than after the previous race in Belgium, where Alonso qualified ninth and Massa 10th. ""Here at Monza the slipstreaming strategy is often used: having a car three to four seconds ahead of you allows you to gain a few tenths and for that I must thank Felipe, especially in Q3 when I came up behind Vergne's Toro Rosso and he waited for me,"" Alonso, Alonso, who won the race for Ferrari in 2010 and McLaren in 2007, said on his team's website. ""The radio messages have been misunderstood, as is often the case when you don't experience something first hand: the word 'genius' refers to the fact that we could have got out before Rosberg had gone by on his quick lap, but this should not raise any doubts about the impeccable job from the whole team. ""Today, we were able to run competitively in all three sessions and get closer than ever before to the rear wings of the Red Bulls. For the first time, there are not so many cars between them and us."" Nevertheless, Alonso's best time of one minute 24.142 seconds was well adrift of Vettel's 1:23.755, while Webber clocked 1:23.968. Vettel is seeking his third victory at Monza, having won there in 2008 with Toro Rosso and again in 2011 on the way to his second of three consecutive world titles. ""We didn't expect to be so strong here, with both cars on the front row,"" he said after earning his fourth pole this season. ""We've had years where we've had a good car, but not a car that's competitive in low downforce trim, so in that regard we did our homework."" Nico Hulkenberg, whose Sauber is powered by a Ferrari engine, provided the surprise of the day as he clinched third place on the grid in 1:24.065. ""I didn't expect that after a very difficult Friday,"" said the German, whose teammate Esteban Gutierrez qualified 17th but will start a place higher following Adrian Sutil's penalty. ""Yesterday we struggled a lot with the car and the guys have done a fantastic job turning it around to give me such a competitive car today."" While Hulkenberg boosted his chances of a best finish since placing eighth in Malaysia in March, Mercedes boss Ross Brawn lamented his team's worst qualifying performance this season. Lewis Hamilton missed final qualifying for the first time in 67 races, and will start 12th on the grid after his run of four successive pole positions ended in miserable style. Nico Rosberg was back in sixth, having missed most of the morning practice due to hydraulics problems. ""That was our worst qualifying session of the year,"" Brawn said. ""With the standards we set ourselves, that makes this result a real disappointment."" Hamilton refused to blame Sutil for the incident that cost the Force India driver a three-place penalty, demoting the German to 17th as punishment for impeding the British driver as he tried to set a timed lap. ""I just didn't get a lap together in Q2 today and it's hugely disappointing, not just for me, but also for the team and I can only apologize to them as we had a quick car today,"" said the 2008 world champion, who won the race last year while at McLaren. ""I came off at Parabolica on my first run which damaged the car and it was a downward spiral from there really."" Daniel Ricciardo, who will replace his fellow Australian Webber at Red Bull next season, bounced back from a difficult Friday by qualifying seventh for Toro Rosso -- his teammate Jean Eric Vergne was 10th. McLaren's struggles continued, with Sergio Perez eighth and 2009 world champion Jenson Button ninth. Kimi Raikkonen's title hopes receded even further as the Finn was back in 11th for Lotus, with teammate Romain Grosjean 13th.","Fernando Alonso will start fifth on the grid for his Ferrari team's home race in Italy .

"(CNN) -- When Yamaha announced that Valentino Rossi would return to the champion motorcycling team this season, many wondered if he would be able to repair his previously fractious relationship with teammate Jorge Lorenzo. However, the threat to Lorenzo's status as world champion is coming from an unexpected source -- Honda's rookie MotoGP rider Marc Marquez. The 20-year-old has won his last two battles with Lorenzo, becoming the youngest winner of a top-level race in Austin, Texas last month and then on Sunday edging his fellow Spaniard into third place after an audacious final-corner overtake which saw the two bikes make contact. What made it harder for Lorenzo to bear was that it came at the part of the Jerez track which had been named in his honor ahead of this weekend's Spanish Grand Prix. ""If somebody did that to me ... for sure, I would be angry,"" Marquez told the MotoGP website. ""Not because of the moment but because I would have lost a place on the podium. I can understand that but, anyway, I have said sorry. ""I thought he would close the corner off a little bit more than he did, but I noticed that he had opened the door so I tried to pass him. When I saw in those last meters that I might touch him, I released the brakes a bit to make sure the touch was going to be a bit softer. ""The most important thing is that we both finished and I just hope that our relationship will get a bit better after a few days."" The result left Marquez on his own at the top of the championship standings, while Lorenzo dropped to third behind race winner Dani Pedrosa. ""I was second all race and lost it at the last corner,"" Lorenzo said. ""Anyway, our bike was not very competitive compared to the Hondas. ""I had a very consistent race, just making two mistakes: I started very badly and didn't close the door enough at the last corner."" Pedrosa celebrated his first win this season and his first at his home race since 2008. ""It was a beautiful race,"" the Honda rider said. ""I was able to ride the bike well, even though it was difficult because the tires were really on the limit. I couldn't push too hard because of that, so I had to ride carefully."" Seven-time world champion Rossi finished fourth ahead of Britain's Cal Crutchlow on a Monster Yamaha Tech 3. ""Unfortunately, I didn't have enough pace at the beginning because we did not find the right balance,"" said Rossi, who is also fourth overall -- 18 points behind Marquez ahead of the next race at Le Mans. ""We have to work very hard -- especially because Lorenzo is faster than us -- so we have to find the right balance and work together with Yamaha because in this race we expected to be stronger than the Hondas but in the end we have finished behind them, so we have a lot of work to do.""","Dani Pedrosa wins Spanish Grand Prix while title rivals tussle behind him .

"(CNN) -- Making it to the top in one of the toughest and most fickle industries in the world, that of fashion design, requires a careful balance of knowing your own essence and giving the public what they expect. That's according to Paco Rabanne's Artistic Director Lydia Maurer, who claims one of the greatest challenges of being a designer is staying true to oneself while at the same time listening to comments from critics, journalists and clients, without getting pulled off course by them. ""It's important to listen to it, but it's important to still stay yourself,"" she says. ""Because as soon as you start losing your essence, you start becoming uninteresting.

The 29-year-old replaced Indian designer Manish Arora as Women's Ready-to-Wear Artistic Director at the French fashion house in June. She began her career at Studio BerÃ§ot in Paris, then took up an internship at Yves Saint Laurent, before joining Martine Sitbon, helping her establish her private line Rue de Mail, followed by a few seasons at Givenchy. Maurer, who has just shown her debut spring/summer 2013 collection for Paco Rabanne at Paris Fashion Week, was born in Germany to a German father and a Colombian mother and at the age of three moved to Mexico. She spent her childhood traveling widely across South America before settling in Paris. She sees herself as a mix of her German side, the designer who thinks about utility and shape and her South American side, which is more instinctive and into meshing together textures and colors. The biggest reward, she says, is creating a collection that persists after the fashion show and seeing that people really want to wear the clothes and the garments do not live on the rack. Read more: Boxing's first female Olympic gold medalist: 'I thought I couldn't continue' Here she talks to CNN's Human to Hero about her childhood interest in fashion, her career to date and the challenges that she faces in her new job. On her childhood interest in fashion ... When I was a child I was always very interested in images, in materials and textures. I just tended to put them in a bag that I would always carry with me, and I would stitch them together or, like, staple them together and make sort of fabrics out of them. I felt that since my childhood I've always loved doing this, and it's what I do naturally -- I mean, I don't need to make an effort to do it. On the influence of living in South America .... I traveled a lot so I would just soak in a lot of feelings, a lot of colors ... and I've always been somebody who likes to record things, so I would ... start taking pictures and making drawings, or taking leaflets and pamphlets and postcards, fabrics, things everywhere and just collect them. It was also I guess my cultural background which is quite rich. I think that it's that sensibility to color also, to materials mostly that people always saw in me. On studying at Studio BerÃ§ot ... You have to know where you're going and what it is that attracts you to be there, to survive in a school like that. They expect collections from you, but no one tells you what to be inspired by ... It forces you to follow your own path, which I feel is the only key to being a good fashion designer. On being appointed Artistic Director of Women's Ready-to-Wear at Pace Rabanne ... I have to represent a company, a fashion house that is historic ... that's always attached to the '60s, and now the biggest challenge is to bring it forward to our times. This is not a fashion house that's purely about style, but mostly about handwork and craftsmanship, and texture and material. On her debut collection for Paco Rabanne ... Nowadays women want things that are ... more functional but at the same time we've such an affluence of clothes and brands that are very wearable, that we also are looking for things that are very precise and very special, like sort of extraordinary pieces. It's also important to balance for me in this collection, the wearable side with the extraordinary piece side. So I, I basically wanted to do something a little bit psychedelic, something that is a little bit '60s but in a ... magic way. Something mysterious. On where she gets inspiration ... We can have our phone and take photos with our iPhone anytime, any place. I travel and I love to bring things back ... even just books or even a shell. Anything can be interesting. On the real purpose of a fashion designer ... In the end, what you're doing is not just supposed to be living for one fashion show, and then you pack it and put it in the archives. It's about giving your creations an afterlife. Giving them the possibility to go out on the street, or to be worn by a celebrity for a show, for a premiere or for any kind of event.","Lydia Maurer is Artistic Director of Paris label Paco Rabanne Women's Ready-to-Wear .

"(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel has already won the 2013 Formula One world championship -- at least that's the view of his Ferrari rivals, despite there being six races left this season. Red Bull driver Vettel took the checkered flag at Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix to win his seventh race of the year and extend his lead over Ferrari's Fernando Alonso in the drivers' standings to 60 points. Despite an encouraging race which saw Alonso finish in second place after starting seventh on the grid, team principal Stefano Domenicali declared that Ferrari will be prioritizing 2014 between now and the end of the current season. ""Now it's clear that 99% of our energies will be concentrated on the 2014 project,"" Domenicali told Ferrari's official website. ""Ahead of the summer break we were striving hard for a performance gain in Singapore, on a track with characteristics that are particularly unsuitable for our car. ""Instead we lost even more ground, despite the fact that the F138 has improved in certain ways, otherwise Fernando would never have managed to do what he did in the second part of the race in terms of tire management.

Next season Alonso will be partnered by Kimi Raikkonen, the current Lotus driver who was the last man to win the drivers' championship for Ferrari in 2007. Alonso hopes a raft of new technical regulations which will be introduced to the sport next season will benefit Ferrari. ""We started (the season) in a good way,"" the 32-year-old, who is without a grand prix win since May, told the BBC. ""We were competitive in Australia, maybe not in qualifying but in the race we were taking care of the tires very, very well, together with Lotus. ""We won in China, we won in Spain and then we seemed to lose a little bit of performance, especially when the 2012 tires came back. ""For next year, we start from zero.

Fasten your seat belts: A guide to Monza . ""It was a good day, but it is still only a Friday,"" the German, a two-time winner of this race, told reporters. ""It looks tight. If you look at it too much it can be a distraction, but I think it will be a close qualifying with many cars up there. ""Tomorrow, I expect it to be close. It is a short lap and there are not too many corners -- so not that much you can do right, and not much you can do wrong."" Red Bull announced earlier this week that Daniel Ricciardo, currently driving for Red Bull's sister team Toro Rosso, will replace Webber in 2014 when his fellow Australian quits F1 to race in the Le Mans series for Porsche. ""Although we're quite competitive, we're not quick enough yet and will have to work hard tonight to see where we can make some improvements,"" said Webber. ""Of course we don't know what fuel loads other teams are on so we'll have to wait and see but there is a bit of work for us to do if we want to compete right at the front tomorrow."" Ricciardo, however, was off the pace -- 13th in the first session and 17th in the second. ""Unfortunately, we seem to have gone in the wrong direction,"" the 24-year-old said. ""Having run only the hard (tires) in the morning, in the afternoon, I did not set a competitive time on the medium. ""I did make some mistakes and I will admit to that, but there were too many of them so we definitely need to get the car to suit me a bit better. At the moment, it's on a knife edge."" Lewis Hamilton won this race with McLaren in 2012, but a repeat performance with his current team Mercedes looks unlikely. The 2008 world champion could only go sixth fastest in the afternoon session after setting the pace in the morning, just ahead of seventh-placed teammate Nico Rosberg. ""Although we're quite competitive, we're not quick enough yet and will have to work hard tonight to see where we can make some improvements,"" said the Briton. ""Of course we don't know what fuel loads other teams are on so we'll have to wait and see, but there is a bit of work for us to do if we want to compete right at the front tomorrow."" All eyes will be on Alonso at Ferrari's home grand prix. The Spaniard registered the fifth fastest lap time, behind the Lotus duo of Kimi Raikkonen and Romain Grosjean.

"(CNN) -- After four months on the scrapheap Paddy Lowe will be back in the fast lane in June after his switch from McLaren to Formula One rival Mercedes was confirmed. Lowe was recruited by Mercedes in January only for McLaren to remove him from his role as technical director and insist he sees out his contract, which was set to expire at the end of the current season. It was originally thought Lowe would replace current Mercedes team principal Ross Brawn, but he will now work alongside his fellow Briton as ""executive director (technical)"" from June 3. The Circuit: CNN's F1 Interactive . ""I am excited to become part of a highly talented and capable technical organization,"" said Lowe, who follows 2008 world championship-winning driver Lewis Hamilton in swapping McLaren for Mercedes, in a statement. ""That is a challenge I am relishing. I have worked closely with Mercedes-Benz for almost 20 years and deeply admire the company's phenomenal commitment to Formula One. I look forward to much success together in the years ahead."" Lowe adds to a wealth of experience in the Mercedes hierarchy. Brawn oversaw all seven of Michael Schumacher's world titles in addition to Jenson Button's in 2009. Mercedes sit fourth in the constructors' championship ahead of Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix, the sixth race of the 2013 season. ""I am delighted to welcome Paddy to the team and to begin working together,"" said Brawn. ""He has an excellent record of success in the sport and would be an asset to any of our rivals in the pit lane. ""Paddy's arrival will further strengthen our organization and puts us in a strong position for the future."" While Mercedes are able to invest in pursuit of race wins, other teams face more stark financial realities. This time last year Williams were celebrating Pastor Maldonado's win at the Spanish Grand Prix. Twelve months on Maldonado and rookie teammate Valtteri Bottas both failed to make it out of the first round of qualifying last time out in Barcelona. While results on the track have been disappointing, deputy team principal Claire Williams insists financial solvency is of greater importance. ""The budget is always the most important thing -- securing more revenue than I did last year,"" Williams, whose father Frank Williams founded the team, told Formula One's official website. ""That is really important to me -- getting as much money in for the team as I possibly can. The more money you have the better your race car can be, in effect. ""Secondly, making sure politically that the team is in the best position. And thirdly - and probably most importantly -- results. ""Being at the top of the grid and fighting for world championships. I'm not going to give up until we're back again."" Bottas is yet to score a point in Formula One, with his best finish of 11th coming at the Malaysian Grand Prix. Williams praised the young Finn, suggesting he will be challenging at the front of the grid as his career progresses. ""I think we definitely have a future world champion at hand -- but of course we have to give him the car to allow him to prove his talent,"" declared Williams. ""He has done a good job so far. He has finished every race, made up positions with great overtaking manoeuvres, and is giving strong feedback to the engineers in order to improve the car.""","Paddy Lowe cleared to join Mercedes from McLaren on June 3 .

"(CNN) -- Mercedes are preparing for a ""true test"" in Sunday's Monaco Grand Prix after Nico Rosberg catapulted the Silver Arrows to the fastest time in practice, with teammate Lewis Hamilton a close second. The German driver, who was raised in Monte Carlo, set the pace around the city's tight and twisting streets with a leading lap of one minute 14.769 seconds on Thursday. ""It was a very productive day for us,"" said Rosberg, who has taken pole position for Mercedes at the last two races in Bahrain and Spain but failed to translate that into podium finishes due to the team's struggles with tire degradation. ""It seems that we are quick again on one lap but we've been working hard again to make improvement to our race pace. ""It will be interesting to see where we are compared to the others over the weekend as it's not really representative today."" Mercedes arrived in the principality as favorites because the street circuit -- the shortest and slowest on the Formula One calendar -- plays to the strengths of their 2013 car. F1 interactive: Discover the secrets of Monaco's circuit . Qualifying is crucial in Monaco, where there are few overtaking opportunities, and Mercedes will be seeking to win a fourth successive pole position in Saturday's qualifying. Michael Schumacher also took pole in Monaco last season, in a Mercedes car not vastly different to this season's charger, which will also give Rosberg and Hamilton confidence that they can repeat his feat. The slower circuit should also be advantageous to Mercedes because it isn't as abrasive on the tires. Tire wear, especially on the rear, has been the team's Achilles heel this season on race days. Rosberg and Hamilton completed 97 laps during Thursday's second practice session in Monaco -- more than any other team -- in an attempt to test their pace and tire performance during long stints on the circuit. ""I'm pleased with what we have achieved here in Monaco,"" said Hamilton, who won in the principality in 2008 on his way to winning the world championship for McLaren. ""I need to improve my one-lap pace. The car is almost there, the pace looks good but we'll work on those areas which can be improved before the weekend."" One-stop strategy . There were predictions in Monaco that some teams might try to stop just once during the race -- which would be a marked contrast to the five-stop strategy the majority of teams had to use last time out in Spain because of Pirelli's rapidly degrading tires. Mercedes team principal Ross Brawn agreed there are some important decisions to be made if the team can capitalize on their potential pace and win their first race of 2013. ""The true test will come on Sunday,"" he said. ""It's a pleasing start but now we have to make the right decisions for Saturday and Sunday."" Double world champion Fernando Alonso kept the Mercedes pair in his sights, though his Ferrari was just under half a second slower than Rosberg's leading time. The Spaniard took some avoiding action to escape a hairy moment in second practice when he came into Rascasse corner to be confronted with Nico Hulkenberg's Sauber on a slower lap. Alonso, winner of the last race in Spain, said he had come to Monte Carlo with even more motivation to be the first driver this season to triumph in successive races -- and also make a bit of history. ""I could be the first man to win for three different teams and for sure that is a huge motivation to do it,"" said Alonso, who won in Monaco for Renault in 2006 and McLaren the following year. ""Of course we want to win the championship, but Monaco is a special race, let's say the most important race of the championship. ""Because everyone in the world has heard something about Monaco Grand Prix, Indy 500 and Le Mans, the three races that everyone knows about even if they are not motorsport fans."" World champions Red Bull admitted they were still looking for answers after their first run around Monaco's legendary circuit. Mark Webber, a two-time Monaco winner including last year, set the fifth fastest time with triple world champion Sebastian Vettel recording the ninth quickest lap. When asked if Red Bull could match the pace of the Mercedes, Webber responded: ""If we could, we would have done it today. ""One minute and 14.7 seconds round here is not hanging around but let's see how things go. You will never come to Monte Carlo and have the perfect day. ""I think traditionally we're never too electric here on Thursdays."" Unlucky for Lotus . Vettel missed time on track in second practice while his Red Bull team worked on his car, which the German later said had a problem with its KERS device -- a kinetic energy recovery system which adds a boost of power. ""It is not completely ideal but that is Friday -- or in this case Thursday,"" he said, referring to Monaco traditionally having practice a day earlier than the other races, which gives teams more time to prepare for qualifying. ""We had a KERS problem this afternoon, so I didn't use that. The guys know what the problem was with that,"" Vettel added. ""My run on super-soft tires was very poor, so we need to understand why."" Lotus will need to patch up Romain Grosjean's car ahead of qualifying. The Swiss driver was the only man to fall foul of Monaco's narrow streets as he crunched the front of his car into the barriers at the Sainte Devote corner. His teammate Kimi Raikkonen, who is second in the championship four points behind Vettel, was sixth fastest in practice.","Nico Rosberg sets the quickest time for Mercedes in practice for Monaco Grand Prix .

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic admitted that this year could have been better for him at the grand slams. He won the Australian Open but lost two finals and had clay-court king Rafael Nadal on the ropes at the French Open. Djokovic, though, had reason to celebrate Monday as he became just the ninth man to spend at least 100 weeks at No. 1 on the tennis tour. Djokovic achieved the top ranking in July 2011, taking over from Nadal, and has mostly held down the No. 1 position ever since. When he caught Nadal two years ago, it marked the first time since 2004 that the Spaniard or Roger Federer wasn't at the summit. ""I was taught to dream big and to dream to be No. 1 in the world,"" Djokovic told the ATP website. ""It takes years of hard work and dedication. ""It is a long process to become a champion. Tennis is a very specific and unique sport, where you take all the credit or all the blame."" Djokovic's major breakthrough came in 2011, when he claimed three of the four majors and started the campaign with 41 consecutive victories. Although he only landed one grand slam title in both 2012 and 2013, Djokovic appeared in a 14th straight grand slam semifinal in New York this month, moving him more than halfway past Federer's impressive record of 23. Nadal, however, is almost certain to reclaim No. 1 this fall since he trails Djokovic by less than 300 points and has no points to defend until 2014. Indeed if Nadal reaches the final of next week's China Open -- where Djokovic is the top seed -- he's guaranteed to leapfrog the Serb. ""There are still a lot of tournaments to come,"" said Djokovic. ""Calculations are not on my mind right now. I am trying to feed on the confidence that I have."" Federer holds the men's record for weeks at No. 1 at 302. Federer is scheduled to return to action at October's Shanghai Masters while the other member of the 'Big Four,' Andy Murray, is set to miss the rest of 2013 with a back injury.","Novak Djokovic becomes the ninth man to spend at least 100 weeks at No. 1 .

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic's Serbia will play holders the Czech Republic in the Davis Cup final but it was the World No.1's teammate Janko Tipsarevic who proved the final day hero in Belgrade. Djokovic, going into semifinal tie against Canada off the back of his defeat to Rafael Nadal in the U.S. Open, played his part by drawing Serbia level at two rubbers apiece as he beat Milos Raonic 7-6 6-2 6-2. But it left the pressure on Tipsarevic, who has slipped down the rankings this season, as he took on Vasek Pospisil in the deciding singles match. Tipsarevic took the first set on tiebreaker and romped through the second with partisan support from the 10,000 home crowd playing its part. Pospisil was nursing an elbow injury and fell 5-2 down in the third only to recover the break and force a second tiebreak. Again Tipsarevic went clear and had four match points at 6-2, only for the Canadian to save them all to level. Undaunted World No.23 Tipsarevic took the next two points to seal their passage to a November 15-17 showdown in Prague with the Czechs. ""This is really special, one of the happiest moments of my professional career,"" he told the official Davis Cup website. ""Janko played an incredible match under huge pressure. I think we will also find the energy for the final,"" said his captain Bogdan Obradovic. Serbia, with Djokovic the key influence, won the Davis Cup in 2010, but are without Viktor Troicki, who is serving an 18 month doping ban handed down by the International Tennis Federation. Earlier, Djokovic easily accounted for the big hitting Raonic to set up the decider. ""The most important thing was to try to neutralize his serve. It's not easy to read,"" he said. The Czechs sealed their final place by forging an unassailable 3-0 lead over Argentina in Prague Saturday. While the semifinalists battled it out, other nations were left to reclaim their places in the 16-strong World Group for next year's competition. Spain, led by Nadal, completed a 5-0 whitewash of Ukraine, while World No.3 Andy Murray beat Croatia's Ivan Dodig Sunday to seal Britain's victory and a return to the top tier of men's team tennis. Steve Darcis, who shocked Nadal in the first round at Wimbledon, was the hero for Belgium in their 3-2 win over Israel. He defeated Amir Weintraub 6-2 6-2 6-2 in the deciding rubber in Antwerp.","Serbia to face Czech Republic in Davis Cup final in November .

"(CNN) -- The Czech Republic remain on course for a second consecutive Davis Cup triumph after beating Argentina 3-0 in the semifinal at Prague's O2 Arena on Saturday. Tomas Berdych and Radek Stepanek took just over two hours to beat Argentine pair Carlos Berlocq and Horacio Zeballos in straight sets, 6-3 6-4 6-2. An under-strength Argentina were without both Juan Martin del Potro and David Nalbandian for the tie and struggled from the outset. Stepanek beat Juan Monaco in straight sets in Friday's opening singles match before Tomas Berdych made it 2-0 with a four-set win over Leonardo Mayer. ""It feels great. This competition means a lot to us and as long as we can keep our winning streak, it's great. It's an honour to play in front of a home crowd. They follow us around the world no matter where we play. This is a thank you to them for their support,"" Stepanek said, www.daviscup.com reported. The Czech team recorded a thrilling 3-2 win over Spain at the same arena last year. ""Davis Cup means a lot,"" Stepanek added, ""it's special for us, for the whole country. We loved so much delivering the trophy last year -- it never gets old and we'd like to keep that trophy because it's beautiful."" Stepanek and co will play either Canada or 2010 winners, Serbia in the final in November. The Canadians take a 2-1 lead into Sunday's deciding singles matches after Daniel Nestor and Vasek Pospisil clinched a five-set win in Saturday's doubles match up against Nenad Zimonjic and Ilija Bozoljac. The 6-7 6-4 3-6 7-6 10-8 victory gives Canada a great chance of making their first Davis Cup final. Milos Raonic will lead his countrymen into new territory if he can overcome world No.1 Novak Djokovic in the Belgrade Arena in the first singles match.

"(CNN) -- A consultant for the Indian Grand Prix remains confident the race has a future, despite admitting it is unlikely to take place in 2014.

Karun Chandhok was a driver for the HRT team in 2010 and is the son of the Federation of Motor Sports Club chief Vicky Chandhok. While saying it would be a shame to lose the race which only made its F1 debut in 2011, Chandok is confident there is a future for elite motorsport at the Buddh International Circuit. ""It'll be a shame if we do lose the grand prix, there's no question about it,"" Karun Chandhok told CNN. ""One scenario we are trying to evaluate is if we have to miss out on 2014 to then try and extend the existing contract, which is for five grands prix. ""Take a sabbatical for a year and try and solve these issues, whatever they may be, ahead of 2015 and 2016."" Chandhok and his father have held talks with Ecclestone, who they believe remains keen on keeping F1 in India. But competition for a spot on the sport's world tour is fierce, with grands prix in New Jersey and Russia set to debut in 2014. Austria also looks set to return as a grand prix venue for the first time since 2003. ""Bernie is spoiled for choice,"" added Chandhok. ""I think Formula One is in demand. You've got Sochi coming on, Austria's already been announced. ""We both spoke with Bernie. He likes India, he likes the Indian Grand Prix, he would like to see it carry on. There are a few issues and hurdles that need to be crossed."" ""It'll be a shame if we do lose the grand prix, there's no question about it.

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer's first appearance in Gstaad for nine years lasted just over an hour as the former World No.1 made an untimely exit to Germany's Daniel Brands. Still experimenting with a larger racquet head, the Swiss maestro was always struggling against an opponent he beat in an ATP tournament in Hamburg last week, going down 6-3 6-4 in 66 minutes. The defeat continues a sorry run for the 17-time grand slam champion, losing in the second round of his Wimbledon title defense and then falling at the semifinal stage in Germany on his return to action. After his defeat, Federer said he had been suffering with back problems, but had decided to press ahead with his return to the Swiss venue. ""I only decided after today's warm-up whether I would play or not,"" he told the official ATP Tour website. ""I'm happy that I was able to play because I've had problems for some time now, already in Hamburg. ""But it didn't get worse during today's match. I'm positive and I felt that it was getting better during the last few days."" Brands, ranked 55th in the world, was always on top, serving decisively with 11 aces and achieving a single break against the favorite in each set. The 31-year-old Federer could take none of his five break point opportunities to leave the home crowd at the clay court tournament disappointed. He famously was presented with cow when he played in Gstaad in 2003 after claiming his first Wimbledon crown and won the event on his last appearance in 2004. Federer's only tournament title in 2013 came on his favorite grass at Halle, but his Wimbledon challenge was cruelly ended by Ukraine's world number 116 Sergiy Stakhovsky on the first Wednesday. It ended the record 36 consecutive grand slam quarterfinal appearances for the Swiss, amid talk his powers were waning. Former champion Marcel Granollers of Spain ended the run of Federico Delbonis with a 6-2 7-5 victory to reach the quarterfinals. Argentina's Delbonis, who shocked Federer in the semifinals in Hamburg, also put out defending Gstaad champion Thomas Bellucci in the first round, but could find no answer against Granollers. He will play Dutchman Robin Haase, who saw off third seed Janko Tipsarevic of Serbia in straight sets, while Brands will take on Victor Hanescu of Romania. Hanescu benefited from the second set retirement of Roberto Bautista Agut in their second round match. Meanwhile, Serbian Davis Cup star Victor Troicki has been handed an 18-month ban for a doping offense, the International Tennis Federation announced Thursday. Former World No.12 Troicki failed to provide a blood sample at the Monte Carlo Masters earlier this year. The 27-year-old will be banned until January 24, 2015. Troicki gave a urine sample after his match, but claimed that he had been assured by the doping control officer (DCO) at the tournament that he could skip the blood sample because he had been feeling unwell. ""The tribunal concluded that the DCO told Mr Troicki that she could not advise him as to whether his reason for not providing a blood sample was valid, and that no such assurances were given by her,"" read an official statement on the ITF website. Troicki's finest hour came in 2010 when he won the decisive final rubber for Serbia in the Davis Cup against France, but he has slipped to outside the top 50 of the current rankings.","Roger Federer crashes out of ATP tournament in Gstaad .

"(CNN) -- Andy Murray's preparations for the defense of his U.S. Open title hit a wall in Montreal as he was beaten in the last 16 by Ernests Gulbis. The world No. 2 was playing in his first tournament since taking the Wimbledon crown in July but sank to a 6-4 6-3 defeat to his Latvian opponent in the Rogers Cup. It was Gulbis' first ever win over Britain's number one, and ended a 13-match winning streak for the Scot. Murray now only has one more tournament in which to fine tune his game before returning to Flushing Meadows, the scene of his first ever grand slam victory 12 months ago. ""I struggled at the start of the first set from the baseline, but then I got more aggressive and took my opportunities,"" Gulbis said in an on-court interview. ""I started this year at 150 in the world, I was struggling. But slowly and surely I am getting to where I belong. I want to crack the top 20. Then, one or two big wins and you are in the top 10."" It was a different story for Rafael Nadal, who continued his unbeaten run on hard courts this season with a hard-fought win over Poland's Jerzy Janowicz. The Spaniard, who won the Indian Wells title earlier in the season in his only other hard court appearance, won 7-6 6-4 against his big-serving opponent. Nadal, also in his first competitive action since his first round loss to Belgian Steve Darcis at Wimbledon, made it 45 wins since returning from a long injury layoff in February. ""I was able to play without limitations these two matches; hopefully I can continue like this,"" Nadal said during an on-court interview. ""That's my goal. I will try to forget this injury with my knee."" The number four seed will now play Australian qualifier Marinko Matosevic in the last eight after he defeated Frenchman Benoit Paire 7-6 6-7 6-3. World No. 1 Novak Djokovic looked to be heading the same way as Murray when he lost the first set of his match against Uzbekistan's Denis Istomin. Istomin had only taking five games off Djokovic in their previous two meetings, but the world No. 66 took the opening set 2-6. But Djokovic roared back to clinch a 2-6 6-4 6-4 victory before donning a fuzzy wig and dancing on court to Daft Punk's ""Get Lucky."" The Serb also showed off his dance moves after his first round win over Florian Mayer. ""He was a better player first half of the match,"" admitted Djokovic. ""I was trying to find rhythm. A lot of unforced errors. Just had a very difficult time to be in the point. ""He did a great job in staying very solid and putting a lot of pressure on me. Then I had to fight. It was a very even match up to the last point. Just glad to get lucky and dance on the court after the match."" At the women's Rogers Cup event in Toronto, Serena Williams breezed into the fourth round with a 6-0 6-3 victory over Belgium's Kirsten Flipkens.

"(CNN) -- Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka has joined the growing list of injury casualties at the WTA Rogers Cup tournament in Toronto. The Belarus star has moved to second in the world rankings, despite losing to Samantha Stosur in the final of the Carlsbad tournament in California. But after Sunday's straight sets defeat Azarenka pulled the plug on her appearance at the prestigious hard court tournament in Canada, citing a lower back injury. ""I'm so disappointed that I can't make it to Toronto as I added it to my schedule knowing what an important event it is,"" Azarenka said in a statement. ""I am sorry to all my Canadian fans and I will work hard to get healthy and back on the courts as soon as possible."" Azarenka had only just recovered from the knee injury which forced her out of Wimbledon after the first round. Maria Sharapova, who also sustained an injury in the second grand slam of the season, was an earlier withdrawal from the Toronto event. It will leave both of them short of match practice on hard courts ahead of the final grand slam of the season at Flushing Meadows for the U.S. Open. Britain's rising young star Laura Robson joined them on the sidelines before hitting a ball. The World No.32 pulled out ahead of a first round match against Belgian Yanina Wickmayer with a wrist injury. Azarenka's withdrawal has meant she will be replaced in the draw by former World No.1 Caroline Wozniacki, with the Dane given a first round bye.

"(CNN) -- The saying goes that a bad workman blames his tools but Roger Federer refused to pin a shock defeat in Hamburg on his new racquet.

""He was better than me,"" said Federer, who lost a tight match 7-6 (9-7) 7-6 (7-4) to the Argentine. ""I don't think it had much to do with the racquet. ""Both sets could have gone either way. It's clearly a pity I couldn't win either of the sets because I was starting to feel better towards the end of the match. ""Unfortunately I couldn't push him further and create more chances. ""I tried everything I could at this tournament. It's been a difficult week."" Federer entered the Hamburg clay-court tournament to try and rediscover some form after a dismal Wimbledon. The Swiss winner of a record 17 grand slams made a shock second-round exit at the All England Club championships at the hands of 116th ranked Sergiy Stakhovsky. Part of his plan to get back to his best has been a decision to play with a larger 98-inch square frame racquet -- eight inches larger than his previous racquet. Explaining his decision to try out the racquet in Hamburg earlier this week, Federer said on the ATP Tour website: ""I've been very close on numerous occasions to changing racquets in a bigger way. ""But then very often, time was the issue. Maybe also just the records of grand slams - I was always keeping on playing quarters and semis - so then it was also a bit more difficult to change it because of the time. ""After I lost at Wimbledon, I thought this is a good time to go and test the racquets, to take a bit of time off and then add some tournaments and see was there enough time to change or not. ""I'm happy I did the change and now we'll see how it goes."" Federer -- who dropped from third to fifth in the world rankings after his Wimbledon loss -- will now head home to Switzerland to play at Gstaad next week.

"(CNN) -- Five-time grand slam singles winner Martina Hingis is to make a return to the WTA Tour later this month in a tournament in the United States. The 32-year-old Swiss officially retired for the second time back in 2007, but has entered the doubles at the Southern California Open in Carlsbad, partnering Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia. Hingis, who was inducted into the International Tennis Hall Of Fame in Newport last weekend, is looking forward to returning to the fray at the tournament, which begins on July 27. ""I feel in good shape at the moment after playing World Team Tennis,"" she told the official WTA website. ""My competitive spirit is still very much alive and I love being out on court."" Hingis, who also won nine grand slam doubles titles in a glittering career, teamed up with Hantuchova in the final three events she played in her first comeback. ""We are honored to have such a great champion choose to make the Southern California Open her first tournament back on tour,"" said tournament director Alastair Garland. Hingis cut short that comeback when it was revealed she had tested positive for a metabolite of cocaine after her third round loss at Wimbledon six years ago. She maintained her innocence, but was banned for two years by the International Tennis Federation. Hingis first burst on to the scene in 1996 by pairing with Helena Sukova to win a grand slam doubles title while only 15 years of age. The following year she became the youngest ever grand slam singles winner at 16 years three months in the Australian Open before becoming the youngest World No.1 in history. Injuries forced her first retirement in 2002 before she returned four years later, but without recapturing her former dominance. There is no indication if Hingis will extend her second comeback to singles competition, but has been successful with Washington Kastles in team tennis. If she does decide to go down that route, Hingis will find that one of her former arch rivals Serena Williams is still in formidable form. The World No.1 suffered a shock defeat at Wimbledon to Sabine Lisicki, but returned to competitive action Tuesday with a straights sets dismissal of Sesil Karatantcheva at the Bastad Open in Sweden. Williams won 6-1 6-2 in the clay court event, extending her record for the year to 47-3, and delighting a packed center court crowd. ""I definitely didn't expect that. I walked out and I felt honored. That's one of the reasons I love to play, to come to countries I've never been to and play in front of a packed stadium. It's just great,"" she told the official WTA website. Williams will next play Anna Tatishvili of Georgia, who beat Swiss wildcard and junior Wimbledon champion Belinda Bencic 2-6 6-4 6-4.","Martina Hingis returns to competitive action on WTA Tour .

"(CNN) -- They are two titans of Flushing Meadows and on Thursday both Roger Federer and Serena Williams breezed into the third round of the U.S. Open. Federer, who won five straight titles in New York between 2004 and 2008, is only seeded seventh -- his lowest mark since 2002 -- but made light work of Carlos Berlocq. The 17-time major champion dispatched his Argentinean opponent 6-3 6-2 6-1 in just 95 minutes and remains on course for a first ever U.S. Open meeting with Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals. ""I didn't know Rafa was in my quarter -- I'm kidding,"" Federer said in an on court interview. ""I am well aware of the draw, but at the moment I am clearly focusing on round by round and it would be a big mistake if I was thinking too much about Rafa. ""I would love to be in that situation but for that to happen I have to keep playing well and keep winning."" Spain's Nadal made light work of world No. 134 Rogerio Dutra Silva, beating the Brazilian 6-2 6-1 6-0. The second seed's victory means he has extended his winning streak on hard courts to 17 matches. ""I think I finished the match playing well, doing a few things well, moving better,"" said the 2010 champion. ""The important thing at the end is winning. The result says that I did the right things."" Williams was playing her second match in two days after a rain saw her opening match delayed but she didn't show any ill effects, storming to a 6-3 6-0 win over Kazakh Galina Voskoboeva. Just a few hours after her sister Venus was knocked out of the tournament, Serena took little time to book a third round clash with another Kazakh, Yaroslava Shvedova. ""I'm definitely used to it,"" Williams said of her schedule. ""I usually play every day. In regular tournaments I don't have a day off. Only in the grand slams I get the luxury of having a day off. I guess I didn't get that. ""Definitely gives you more time to work on things you want to do in your next match, so that's kind of more or less how I look at it, just as getting more time to be more ready."" Williams also lent her support to Italy's Sara Errani, the fourth seed, who made a tearful exit from the tournament after being beaten in straight sets by compatriot Flavia Pennetta. Errani said: ""I'm feeling too much pressure. I don't know why, but I'm not enjoying going on the courts, and that is the worst thing a player can have."" The 26-year-old was runner up at the French Open in 2012 and reached the semis in New York last year but Williams said the Italian shouldn't be so hard on herself. ""It's hard but I think she's doing a good job,"" Williams said. ""I mean, sometimes you have a tough day at the office, and it doesn't mean that you didn't handle the pressure well. I think she's a good player."" Elsewhere, the seventh seed, Petra Kvitova from the Czech Republic, beat Serbia's Bojana Jovanovski 6-4 6-2 and ninth seed Jelena Jankovic, from Serbia, beat Russia's Alisa Kleybanova 6-3 6-2. Angelique Kerber, the eighth seed from Germany, defeated Canada's Eugenie Bouchard in straight sets while 13th seed Ana Ivanovic, from Serbia, beat Romania's Alexandra Dulgheru 6-2 6-1. In the men's draw, Spain's fourth seed David Ferrer beat fellow countryman Roberto Bautista Agut 6-3 6-7 6-1 6-2 while Richard Gasquet, the eighth seed from France, triumphed 6-3 7-5 7-5 over compatriot Stephane Robert. Britain's Dan Evans continued his fairytale run in the ""Big Apple."" The world 179 had not won a grand slam match in his career prior to the tournament, now he finds himself in the third round following a 1-6 6-3 7-6 6-3 win against Australia's Bernard Tomic.

"(CNN) -- It did not take long for Sergiy Stakhovsky to be handed a sober dose of reality after his upset defeat of seven-time champion Roger Federer, the Ukrainian outsider exiting in the next round at Wimbledon Friday. Stakhovsky caused one of the biggest shocks in the history of the tournament on Centre Court on a crazy Wednesday at SW19, but was banished to Court Three for his match against experienced Austrian Jurgen Melzer. Lacking the inspiration he showed against third seed Federer, and hampered by a fall that led to the 27-year-old having his ankle strapped, Stakhovsky went down 6-2 2-6 7-5 6-3. It left Melzer as the first man into the last 16, where he will play promising young Pole and 24th seed Jerzy Janowicz. He beat the higher ranked and 15th seed Nicolas Almagro, 7-6 6-3 6-4, to reach the fourth round for the second straight year at Wimbledon. Stakhovsky joins the tournament's other great giantkiller, Belgian Steve Darcis, in being unable to capitalize on a famous victory. Darcis, who stunned Rafael Nadal on the opening Monday, scratched before his second round match as he joined the long list of injury casualties which has marked this year's grass court grand slam. Stakhovsky was preceded on Court Three by Bulgarian 29th seed Grigor Dimitrov, the boyfriend of Maria Sharapova. The Russian superstar, herself a victim of an unseeded player two days ago, watched as Dimitrov slipped to a five-set defeat, 3-6 7-6 3-6 6-4 11-9, to Slovenia's Grega Zemlja, in a match carried over from the previous night. Steady drizzle made for tricky conditions for the players on the outside courts. Dubbed the ""Baby Federer"", the 22-year-old Dimitrov often showed his displeasure at the surface as he joined the Swiss maestro on the sidelines. There were no such problems for Spanish fourth seed David Ferrer as he completed his second round match against compatriot Roberto Bautista Agut, but was taken to four sets. Home hopes in the women's singles were boosted by Laura Robson as she breezed into the third round with a 6-4 6-1 defeat of Mariana Duque-Marino of Colombia. And the Wimbledon crowd were given the perfect end to the day's play as second seed Andy Murray cruised past Spain's Tommy Robredo, winning 6-2 6-4 7-5 in two hours under the roof of the famous Centre Court.","Sergei Stakhovsky exits Wimbledon at third round stage .

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic triumphed in one of Wimbledon's classic matches and Andy Murray subdued the challenge of a young upstart Friday to set up a dream final showdown at the grass court grand slam. World No.1 Djokovic needed four hours 43 minutes, the longest men's singles semifinal in the tournament's history, to beat Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro, 7-5 4-6 7-6 6-7 6-3. Home favorite and second seed Murray won a gripping, but at times controversial, last four clash with Poland's Jerzy Janowicz, 6-7 6-4 6-4 6-3 to join him in the title match. It will be their fourth clash in a grand slam final, the last won by Djokovic in the Australian Open earlier this year. The top seed was involved in the match of the tournament, marked by breathtaking and grueling rallies, none more so than when Djokovic had the first of his chances to win as he led 6-4 in the fourth set tiebreak, holding two match points. An incredible 24-shot exchange ended with Djokovic hitting long and former U.S. Open champion del Potro took advantage to win the next three points, including the second match point, to force the decider. The pace was unrelenting and Del Potro finally cracked in the eighth game, conceding his service to leave 2011 champion Djokovic to serve for his place in the final. Del Potro was still not finished and forced a break point, but Djokovic was not to be denied and closed out victory on his third match point with a backhand winner. ""It was one of the best matches I have been part of, one of the most exciting, it was so close,"" he told BBC Sport. ""That's why he's a grand slam champion, he came up with some unbelievable shots . ""I'm very proud to go through. When I lost the fourth set of course it was disappointing because I was close to winning and didn't capitalize. ""He came up with some big forehands. It was a very high level of tennis,"" he added. Del Potro, apparently nursing an injury, had beaten Djokovic in the 2012 London Olympics bronze medal match on Wimbledon grass, and sensed another upset. After Djokovic took the first set on a single break of service in the 12th game, eighth seed del Potro hit back to level by claiming his opponent's service for the first time. The third set was again played at a high intensity and Djokovic had three points to take it as he led 6-5, but again del Potro responded to force a tiebreak. Djokovic moved ahead again by dominating it for the loss of just two points and when he broke to lead 4-3 in the fourth it looked all over. But that was to underestimate del Potro and in the next game he bravely leveled before his tiebreak heroics which will be long remembered. Long wait . All the time Murray and his 24th seeded opponent Janowicz were waiting and by the time they emerged on Centre Court it was early evening. The 22-year-old Janowicz signaled he was not going to roll over with confident play in the first set and when it went to the tiebreak he took control to win it 7-2. Murray gained the early break in the second set and eventually leveled at one set apiece. But with Janowicz again powering ahead to 4-1 in the third set, the alarm bells were ringing for the Scot. But showing great character and finally inspiring the crowd into raucous mood, he blasted through the next five games to take the set. With light fading and following continuous complaints from Janowicz, referee Andrew Jarrett ordered the roof to be closed, meaning a delay of 20 minutes. Angry Murray . Murray, with the momentum behind him, was outraged and loudly complained to the officials -- ""That's not fair,"" he said. He later revealed that Janowicz, who has soared up the rankings since reaching last year's Paris Masters final, had spent the delay making a mobile phone call. ""He seemed very relaxed. That's the sort of player he is, that's why he is very loose on the court,"" was Murray's verdict. When they emerged for the second time, Murray almost immediately broke Janowicz's service and saw it through to the finish, winning with a whipped forehand to reach his second straight Wimbledon final.","Serbia's Novak Djokovic to play Andy Murray in Wimbledon final .

"(CNN) -- World number one Novak Djokovic began his bid to win a second Wimbledon title with a straight sets victory as he focused hard on avoiding a shock Rafael Nadal-style defeat. A day after the Spaniard bowed out against Belgian world No. 135 Steve Darcis, the Serb was in unforgiving mood as he defeated Germany's Florian Mayer 6-3 7-5 6-4. Djokovic was playing his first match since losing a thrilling five-set semifinal at the French Open against Nadal, who went on to win the tournament for a record eighth time. ""I watched the bigger part of (the Nadal-Darcis) match and I thought that his opponent played great,"" Djokovic said. ""Darcis came up with some incredible shots, incredible points in important moments and he deserved to win. ""I know people expect all the top players to get to at least the final stages of a grand slam or whatever tournament they play. It was a surprise in the end him losing to Darcis, but his opponent played great."" Having been seeded in the opposite section of the draw, Djokovic would have been unable to meet Nadal until the final itself but now his main rivals would appear to be either Wimbledon maestro Roger Federer, the defending champion, or local favorite Andy Murray. Yet Djokovic is refusing to look so far ahead as he says the early rounds of grand slams can be very testing for the world's leading players. ""You cannot take anything or anybody for granted. You have to be grateful for being in this position and work even harder to stay there,"" said the 2011 Wimbledon champion. ""The sport is evolving, like everything in life. Everybody is getting better, getting more professional. ""Especially at the opening stages of grand slams, there are a lot of quality players who have nothing to lose really coming on the Center Court or Court One, playing in front of 10,000 or more people. ""Against one of the top players, what can you really lose? You're going and you're playing your best tennis."" Djokovic had taken a risk ahead of the championships by failing to play any competitive matches on grass but he gave a convincing display against a player whose game, the Serb says, is ""suited to grass"". Bidding for a seventh grand slam, Djokovic will now meet American Bobby Reynolds in the second round. The Serb is in the same half of the draw as David Ferrer, the Spanish fourth seed who lost his first grand slam final to Nadal last month. A master of clay, Ferrer had to adapt to the Wimbledon surface as he beat Wimbledon debutant Martin Alund of Argentina in four sets. ""It is difficult to play on grass for my game,"" said Ferrer. ""It is very difficult to defend. I am happy because I am in the second round but I know that I have to improve my game."" In other matches on Tuesday, seven seed Tomas Berdych eased through in straight sets against Martin Klizan in what is the Czech's 40th straight appearance at a grand slam. Germany's Tommy Haas, a quarterfinalist at Roland Garros, overcame Dmitry Tursunov while Juan Martin del Potro beat Albert Ramos in straight sets. Elsewhere, Australia's Bernard Tomic defeated American 21st seed Sam Querrey before making an impassioned plea for his controversial father to be allowed entry to Wimbledon. Tomic's father has been barred from attending by Wimbledon authorities after an incident involving his son's doubles partner Thomas Drouet in May, with security guards having been told to deny John Tomic entry even if he buys a ticket. Bernard wants Wimbledon and the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) to overturn the suspension imposed after John was accused of headbutting Drouet on the streets of Madrid. The ban is ongoing at all ATP events until the case reaches its conclusion, with Tomic set to face a Madrid court in October, and his 20-year-old son is now missing both his father and coach. ""All of a sudden not to have someone there who's been there for you your whole life is very difficult. It's not a good feeling. It's tough,"" said Bernard, whose father is staying with him in south London. ""I'll try and have a word with (the Wimbledon authorities). I know they are very strict here. We'll see what they say. It would be amazing to have my dad here watching me as a coach and a father."" John Tomic has claimed self-defense for his actions.","World number one Djokovic beats Germany's Florian Mayer in straight sets .

"(CNN) -- World number one Serena Williams put her recent controversies to one side as she cruised past Mandy Minella of Luxembourg 6-1 6-3 in the first round at Wimbledon. Worryingly for her opponents, the defending champion -- who won every point on her serve in the first set -- said she wasn't at the top of her game despite winning her 32nd consecutive match. The run is the best since 2008, when Belgium's Justine Henin achieved a similar number of straight wins. Serena is now just three wins away from the women's record, which is something of a family affair after elder sister Venus recorded her 35th unbeaten game in 2000. The world No. 1 will break that record if she reaches the quarterfinals at a venue where she also won Olympic gold last year. ""I feel like I was a little rusty for some reason today,"" Serena, who is bidding for a sixth Wimbledon title, told reporters after a victory that took just 57 minutes. ""I don't feel like I played my best tennis. I felt really upset when I lost my serve at the beginning in the second set - that said, I think Mandy played really well."" ""To be honest, I'm a little excited I was able to play a tough match and get through it."" The past week certainly hasn't been as smooth as Serena would have liked after becoming embroiled in a row with Maria Sharapova and having to defend comments made in an article that appeared in Rolling Stone magazine. The American has since apologized to the Russian after the article included a veiled reference to the latter's relationship with Bulgarian player Grigor Dimitrov in addition to controversial comments about the rape of a 16-year-old girl in Ohio. In reply, Sharapova made stinging comments about Williams' own personal life, with the American romantically linked with her French coach Patrick Mouratoglou, who was courtside on Monday. ""I personally talked to Maria at the player party. I said; 'Look, I want to personally apologize to you if you are offended by being brought into my situation. I want to take this moment to just pour myself, be open, say I'm very sorry for this whole situation',"" Williams said on Sunday. The 16-time grand slam winner is in the form of her life at the age of 31 and may be reassessing how long she has left at the top following the feats of Kimiko Date-Krumm, who Williams could meet in the third round. The 1996 semifinalist, who is just three months short of her 43rd birthday, beat an opponent who was just four when the Japanese made her Wimbledon debut in 1989. 18-year-old German qualifier Carina Witthoeft was no match for the veteran as Date-Krumm won 6-0 6-2 before revealing one of the secrets of her success. ""I'm taking care of my body, because of course the most difficult thing is recovery. I need more training. But if I do too much, I feel tired,"" she said. ""I like Chinese tea. Sometimes Japanese tea. I drink a lot. I have a tea pot I always I carry. It's here with me now."" In other highlights on Tuesday, the home crowd had a match to savor on Court One as 19-year-old Briton Laura Robson knocked out tenth seed Maria Kirilenko, who made the quarterfinals last year. The world number 38 claimed a 6-3, 6-4 win. ""That was a big one for me just because of all the nerves and playing in front of your home crowd at Wimbledon,"" said Robson, who won Wimbledon as a junior. Elsewhere, Polish fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska -- who finished runner-up to Williams last year - cruised past Austrian qualifier Yvonne Meusberger with a 6-1 6-1 victory.","Defending champion Williams into second round with straight sets win .

"(CNN) -- Kirsten Flipkens is just one game away from a Wimbledon final -- a year ago, she was just happy to be alive. It is a fairytale story at a tournament which has brought up more surprises than anybody ever thought possible -- but Flipkens' tale is something special. In April 2012, following a long haul flight to Thailand, the tennis star was forced to visit an emergency doctor after complaining of searing pains in her legs. It was there that doctors discovered she had four blood clots in her legs -- had she ignored the pains, then she was told that her life would have almost certainly been in danger. She had been poised to travel to Japan for a Fed Cup game, a journey which doctors told her would have left her body 'blue' and left her on the edge. ""I'm lucky to be alive,"" she said in January. Now, she's ready to make the most of her second chance. The 2003 junior champion is one of four women remaining with the name of a new winner guaranteed to be etched onto the famous trophy. For Flipkens, a hard-fought victory over 2011 champion Petra Kvitova secured a first ever grand slam semifinal -- and the prospect of a place in Wimbledon history. ""It's amazing,"" she told the BBC. ""It's more than a dream coming true, semifinals of a Grand Slam, ridiculous. ""Last year I didn't get into qualifying of Wimbledon. ""I was so calm on court, I went for my shots. Petra was playing really well in that first set. I just had to go for it from the second set on."" It is a marked contrast in emotion to that which Flipkens experienced after being forced to take a break from the game in a bid to overcome the blood clots in her legs. Her ranking slumped from 182 to 262 -- a drop which led to the Belgian Tennis Federation withdrawing its funding. But under the guidance of former World No.1 and four time grand slam winner Kim Clijsters, Flipkens fought back. She won her first title in Quebec City in September and rose to 43rd in the world after reaching the fourth round at the Australian Open in January. She reached the top 20 in March and believes the influence of Clijsters has played a major role in her revival. Flipkens added: ""Kim was one of people last year still believing in me. ""I have to thank her. The people believing in my I could count on one hand."" But Flipkens will face a tough task to reach the final Thursday when she goes up against 15th seed Bartoli, who battled to a 6-4 7-5 win over U.S. star Sloane Stephens. Bartoli, who finished runner-up in 2007, edged a low quality affair where there eight breaks of serve in the opening nine games of the second set. Bartoli also courted controversy when she urged the umpire to abandon play when light rain began to fall with the score at 5-4 and 40-40 in her favor in the opening set. The crowd voiced its frustration, jeering the French lady before the players returned to action two and a half hours later. Wimbledon: Fast Facts . Bartoli quickly wrapped up the set and then moved into a 2-0 lead before Stephens broke back. But the 20-year-old American consistently struggled with her serve and was broken again in the 12th game. Earlier, Sabine Lisicki followed up her shock win over title favorite Serena Williams to become the first woman to march into the the last four. There was no need for a repeat of the German's giant-slaying slog on grass as Lisicki rattled out a straightforward 6-3 6-3 victory over Estonia's Kaia Kanepi. The 23-year-old -- coincidentally also the 23rd seed for the grass-court tournament --was in tears after beating Williams but said she had to pull herself together for her quarterfinal. ""It was an amazing match yesterday, but I had to make sure that I had calmed down and was ready for today,"" explained Lisicki. ""I have had experience of other years to help me."" Lisicki also spoke about having to ""learn how to walk again"" after a serious ankle injury in 2010 left her with no muscle strength in her left calf. ""To come back on the court to compete and then to go even further than I did before the injury gives you a lot of strength,"" she added. ""It's a different feeling when I'm out there now. To have your hobby as a job is something that not a lot of people can say they have. I love the game so much."" Lisicki has never gone past the fourth round at any grand slam outside of Wimbledon but she has an impressive record at The All England Club, having reached the quarter-finals three times and the last four in 2011. The German faces Agnieszka Radwanska in the semifinals after the Polish world number four came through a grueling match against China's Li Na. Their sizzling match-up on Centre Court was delayed twice by rain before the tournament organizers decided to close the court's multi-million dollar roof. When the roof had slotted into place and the action finally resumed, Radwanska wasted no time building on her 2-0 lead over Li in the deciding third set. But the Pole, who played with a heavily-strapped right thigh and then took an injury timeout to receive treatment on her other thigh, had to see off a final rally by the Chinese sixth seed. The 2012 Wimbledon runner-up needed eight match points, in a game that lasted just seconds shy of the 10-minute mark, to defeat Li 7-6 (7-5) 4-6 6-2 and set up her meeting with Lisicki. ""She was playing unbelievable tennis,"" said Radwanska. ""I'm just very happy to go through even though I was struggling in the third set. ""Too much tennis, that was I was struggling with that. I'm just going to keep going and try my best."" Looking forward to her semifinal against Lisicki, Radwanska said: ""We have known each other since our junior days -- it'll be a great challenge playing each other on the grass.""","Belgium's Kirsten Flipkens defeated 2011 winner Petra Kvitova .

"(CNN) -- A bomb exploded at a Woodburn, Oregon, bank branch early Friday evening, killing a police officer and injuring the town's police chief and a state bomb technician, Oregon State Police said. A police officer was killed Friday after a bomb exploded inside the West Coast Bank in Woodburn, Oregon. Woodburn Police Chief Scott Russell was listed in critical condition at Oregon Health and Science University Hospital, according to hospital spokeswoman Christine Decker. The name of the slain police officer has not yet been released. There was no immediate word on the bomb tech's identity or condition. The three were investigating a suspicious device at a West Coast Bank branch when the bomb went off, police said. Police had brought the device inside after it was discovered outside, bank president Bob Sznewajs told CNN. Sznewajs said that two bank employees who were in another part of the bank when the bomb exploded suffered very minor injuries, one who may have been hit by some flying debris and another who was ""bothered by the sound."" ""I know that all of our employees are fine,"" Sznewajs said, adding that none of his employees had been allowed back into the front portion of the building, where the bomb exploded, ""so we don't know what it's like in there."" ""I heard a loud kaboom,"" Robert Currie, who was across the street, told CNN affiliate KATU. ""Well, I'm a Vietnam veteran and that was no gunshot -- that was definitely a bomb. So I come running outside to see what was going on and the interior lights of the bank are all out. And the next thing, it's just swarming with police cars, two fire trucks and three or four ambulances."" Several emergency vehicles surrounded the building, according to news video from the scene, but the exterior of the building did not appear damaged. Sznewajs said police were called to investigate a suspicious package Friday afternoon. Police gave the all clear, Sznewajs said, but a bank employee saw something in a bush outside the bank, and police were called back. Sznewajs said he was not at the bank at the time of the incident, but he said his employees told him authorities ""scanned it outside, then brought it in."" His employees had left the front of the building by that point, Sznewajs said, and it was not clear why the device was taken into the building. Sznewajs said there were ""four or five"" employees in the bank when the incident began and approximately the same number of customers. None were in the front of the bank when the explosion took place. Earlier Friday, police investigated a bomb threat called into a nearby Wells Fargo Bank branch but found nothing, Wells Fargo spokesman Tom Unger said.

"(CNN) -- For ardent royalists and keen followers of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations, there could have been few more fitting tributes to the British monarch's abiding reign than Sunday's 1000-strong flotilla. The vast fleet of multi-colored, eccentrically-clad yachts - which included everything from ancient tall ships to Viking-style longboats -- was led by a gold-gilded barge carrying the queen herself, reflecting an intimate and centuries-old communion between the royal family and the high-seas. Throughout history, British monarchs have relied on the country's sea power to protect their kingdom and conquer new territories. During the 18th and 19th centuries their naval conquests ensured that the ""sun never set"" on its empire, but even though times have changed since then, the monarchy still enjoys a very special relationship with the symbolically titled Royal Navy. The queen's husband, Prince Philip, is its Lord High Admiral, while her son Charles holds the rank of Admiral -- having taken command of his own ship in 1976. Prince William is Sub Lieutenant and Commodore-in-Chief for Scotland and Submarines and completed an attachment with the Royal Navy in 2008. The queen's father, George VI, was the last British sovereign to have seen action in navy battle when, as a 20-year-old Sub-Lieutenant in the Royal Navy, he fought during the First World War in the Battle of Jutland, May 1916. But it's not just in the arena of naval warfare that the royals exhibit their maritime affections. There are probably few finer examples of a regal leisure boat than ""Her Majesty's Yacht Britannia,"" built especially for the queen in 1953. Now decommissioned and on display in Edinburgh, Scotland, the vast and lavishly designed ""Britannia"" has sailed over one million miles during 44 years of service over the course of 968 official royal visits. Once described by Queen Elizabeth as ""the one place where I can truly relax,"" the royal yacht was built to many of her specifications. Over the years it played host to the likes of Sir Winston Churchill, Boris Yeltsin, Rajiv Gandhi and Nelson Mandela and has been used for four royal honeymoons - including Prince Charles and Princess Diana's 16-day trip in the Mediterranean. Back on the Thames, British monarchs have a long-standing tradition of using the winding river to celebrate different types of royal events such as processions, receptions, coronations, weddings and christenings. According to the Diamond Jubilee Pageant historians, King Richard III may have been the first English monarch to go to his coronation by water, rather than by land, in 1483. Four years later Henry VII didn't spare any costs when his queen, Elizabeth of York, was escorted up the river by a company of barges adorned with red, flame-breathing dragons. A generation later, Anne Boleyn's coronation in 1533 was one of the grandest spectacles ever seen on the river. Reports from the event suggest that it featured an impressive armada of more than 300 lavishly-apparelled vessels, and her leading barge contained a moving mechanical dragon -- complete with men dressed as monsters, casting fire towards the spectators on the riverbank. An altogether less frightening pageant was hosted by King George I, who commissioned German-born composer Handel to write him a piece for the event in 1717. The ""Water Music"" concert was performed for the king on his barge and, according newspaper reports of the time, he enjoyed it so much he ordered the 50 exhausted musicians to play the suites three times during the trip. ""Back then the Thames was the biggest boulevard in London, so if a monarch wanted to make an impression on the populous they would do it on the river,"" said Pageant Master Adrian Evans, the man responsible for organizing Sunday's eye-popping event. As Britain began to industrialize, the number of royal pageants began to dwindle. At the time the river was virtually an open sewer, with the Houses of Parliament once having to be abandoned because MPs were ""overpowered by the smell,"" according to the official Diamond Jubilee Pageant website. The industrialization during the Victorian era also meant the streets of London were paved and broadened to make way for machinery and traffic. ""When the streets started to be redeveloped the event planners realized it was easier to do these types of celebrations on dry land, so they forgot about the river,"" said Evans. Until now that is. After decades of hard work to clean the Thames,. it is now enjoying a new era of popularity. Read more from Mainsail: 'Queen of yachting' captures sailing's golden era on film . ""The relationship between the river and city has changed over the past 30-40 years. The Thames is now one of the cleanest metropolitan rivers in the world. The best new architecture in London is built on the riverbank's edge, and a walk by the riverbank is one of the most popular things for tourists to do when they come to visit,"" said Evans. ""I think it's fabulous that the river has sunk back into the hearts of the city. So it makes absolute sense that the Diamond Jubilee pageant should be on the river,"" he added. Ultimately, the royal family's love-affair with sailing vessels ""comes down to the fact that Britain is an island nation"" according to Hannah Cunliffe, from the National Historic Ships UK organization. Pageant master Adrian Evans agrees, but says that the symbolic connection between royalty and the sea reflects a broader disposition embedded in the national psyche: ""Britons' relationship with water runs deep, and our characters have been forged by the canals and the rivers.""","The British royal family has a centuries-old relationship with boats and the sea .

"(CNN) -- Skiing star Tina Maze has revealed she received a death threat just hours before becoming the first person to break 2000 World Cup points in a season in Germany. The 29-year-old, who won the overall World Cup, received the threat in an email Saturday before being put under police protection for the rest of the weekend. Slovenia's Maze, who finished fourth in Sunday's super-G after winning Saturday's downhill race, was given extra security after event organizers were sent the threat. Amazing Maze breaks Maier points record . ""It's bizarre, I can only laugh about it,"" Maze told reporters after her fourth place in Sunday's race left her with 2074 points for the season. ""I don't really want to talk about it; it was just a normal day at the office. ""I have a clean conscience; I haven't done anything bad, some people are just jealous. ""I haven't seen anything myself, the threat came through the organizers, but I have never felt as safe as I did today. ""If whoever is responsible wanted to distract me or put me off, they didn't succeed. ""But it's not easy when you have the feeling that something can happen."" Innerhofer equals record . On Saturday, Maze became only the third woman to win a World Cup race in all give disciplines in a single season, matching Austria's Petra Kronberger (1990-91) and Croatia's Janica Kostelic (2005-6). She also became the first person to have eclipsed Hermann Maier's previous mark of 2000 set in the 1999-2000 season. And despite the threat on her life, Maze has confirmed she will remain in Garmisch for the next three days before moving on to Ofterschwang in south-west Germany for the next World Cup event. ""We regret that this has happened very much. It is very, very serious,"" Peter Fischer, head of the organizing committee in Garmisch-Partenkirchen told reporters. ""We received an anonymous email and contacted the police immediately, who took over handling the matter. ""We don't know if this was an individual acting alone or a group of people. ""We had to take this very seriously and the main thing was keeping Tina safe, so we achieved that goal. ""It's good that she is strong minded and still felt good being here. ""She has said she will stay here for three days before going onto Ofterschwang for the next race."" Ski legend Tomba's great regret . Meanwhile, Austria's Anna Fenninger claimed her second World Cup win of the season Sunday by claiming victory in the Super-G. The 23-year-old, who won the world super combined title on the Khandahar course at the venue in 2011, clocked a time of 1 minute 20.43 seconds while Germany's Maria Hoefl-Riesch finished 0.20 seconds back. It was Fenninger's second win of the season having won the giant slalom in Semmering, Austria, in December. ""I deserved it, I was ready for this win and I believed in myself,"" Fenninger told reporters. ""I made a few mistakes on the top part and really risked everything on the bottom section, but everything came together. It feels good."" Elsewhere, Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway won the men's World Cup super-G title with victory at Kvitfjell. Svindal claimed his 21st career victory in a time of 1 minute 29.79 seconds, finishing ahead of Austria's Georg Streitberger and Italy's Werner Heel. Svindal is now just 29 points behind overall World Cup leader Marcel Hirscher of Austria.","Slovenia's Tina Maze confirms she received death threat .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer began preparations for the defense of his Wimbledon title by cruising into the quarterfinals with a crushing victory over German wildcard Cedrik-Marcel Stebe at the Halle Open Wednesday. The 17-time grand slam winner needed just 67 minutes to record a 6-3 6-3 win in his first outing since losing to France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at the quarterfinal stage of the French Open. Federer suffered defeat playing alongside Tommy Haas in the doubles on Monday but bounced back in comfortable fashion. ""I was satisfied with my performance even if there were things I could have done better,"" the world number three told reporters. ""I hope to get stronger with each match."" Federer, 31, has not won a single title this season and is keen to get to add to the five crowns he has already won at the German tournament. The Swiss ace has reached the final seven times, winning five of those between 2003-2008, while he lost out in 2010 to Lleyton Hewitt, and to Germany's Haas last year. ""Any title is good for your confidence,"" he added. ""I want to be in the best position to do well here in Halle then at Wimbledon. I feel that my best chance is here."" Federer will face German Mischa Zverev, ranked 156 in the world, in the next round. One man who won't be playing at Wimbledon is France's Gael Monfils, who has withdrawn from the tournament for personal reasons. ""I've withdrawn my request for a wildcard because I've got a small personal problem to sort out during the coming week,"" he told reporters following his second round win over Jan Hernych in Halle. ""Something unexpected has come up in the first week of Wimbledon."" Monfils, ranked 67 in the world, is expected to compete at the Stuttgart clay-court tournament which starts on July 8. Elsewhere at Halle, Japan's Kei Nishikori suffered a shock three-set defeat by Russia' Mikhail Youzhny. The Russian, 30, claimed a surprise 6-1 6-7 6-3 win after a battle which lasted over two hours. Meanwhile, former World No.1 Lleyton Hewitt pulled off an impressive straight sets win over Bulgaria's rising star Grigor Dimitrov at Queen's Club in London. Hewitt, who won at Wimbledon in 2002, prevailed 6-4 6-3 in just 68 minutes. ""Today's victory is going to help me immensely,"" he told the ATP website. ""I feel like in practice, I have been hitting the ball great. It was just a matter of doing it on the match court. ""My first match wasn't pretty, but I fought hard and got through it. That's what I needed to do. Then today it was a classy performance."" Hewitt will play 2010 winner Sam Querrey for a place in the quarterfinals. Elsewhere, there were victories for Tomas Berdych, Alexandr Dolgopolov and British wild card Dan Evans. Andy Murray's match against Nicolas Mahut was suspended because of rain after the Briton had taken the first set 6-3.","Roger Federer wins opening match at Halle Open in Germany .

"London, England (CNN) -- Windsurfers took to the sea Tuesday for what could be the last time in an Olympic Games if the International Sailing Federation gets its way. In May 2012 the International Sailing Federation (ISAF) decided that windsurfing -- which made its Olympic debut in 1984 -- would not be included in the Rio 2016 Olympics. Instead, it is set to be replaced by kiteboarding, a younger and faster sport that is growing in popularity. It was a close vote, but one that went 19-17 in favor of kiteboarding. Read more: Kiteboarding -- Meet future champions of newest Olympic sport . However, the windsurfers are fighting back with legal action and online petitions against the ISAF. The International RS:X Class Association -- the international windsurfing body -- lodged a request at the High Court in London for a judicial review into ISAF's decision, which it calls ""perverse and unfair."" ""We took legal advice early on and their advice was that we had a good case, and on that basis we decided to go ahead,"" said Rory Ramsden, the windsurfing body's executive secretary. The ISAF swiftly issued a statement saying it was ""extremely disappointed"" that this course of action has been taken and that it ""intends to fully defend"" its decision to make kiteboarding an Olympic class, which it says was taken in line with its regulations. In May ISAF's President GÃ¶ran Petersson said the decision marked a ""new era for sailing"" and that kiteboarding had fulfilled the criteria set out by the organization's evaluation panel. ""Kiteboarding has proven to us that it is ready to be included into the list of prestigious ISAF Events and it is a fantastic addition to the sailing program for the 2016 Olympic Games,"" he added. Read more: Weymouth -- Olympic sailing on Jurassic Coast . Few, including the kiteboarders themselves, expected such a result. On hearing the news Britain's top windsurfer, Nick Dempsey, tweeted: ""Wow, unexpected. That was a big decision and a very sad day for windsurfing."" Dempsey won bronze at the 2004 Athens Olympics in the RS:X class, and silver in Tuesday's Olympic windsurfing final in Weymouth. But at 31 it is also likely to be his last Games. Bob Ingram, the chair of the UK Windsurfing Association said that ISAF's decision was met by ""both anger and sadness"" in the windsurfing community. ""We really didn't expect it,"" he said. ""There are a lot of people who have dedicated a lot of their lives to windsurfing and to see it all being pulled from under us is very, very sad."" He added: ""You only have to look at the windsurfing going on at the Olympics right now to see that it is a spectacular and a dynamic sport that is media friendly and has a global following."" The International Kiteboarding Association (IKA) said in a statement that it was ""shocked"" by the decision to take legal action against the ISAF. The chairman of IKA, Richard Gowers, said: ""I think it's a grave mistake. To launch a legal action in the middle of the Olympics is not only damaging to RS:X but also to the sailing world."" Gowers said that he thinks it is ""unfortunate that there are only 10 sailing classes available in the Olympics"" and that the IKA never wanted kiteboarding to replace windsurfing. Read more: London 2012 Olympics -- sailing guide . ""As an ex-windsurfer myself I would love to see both sports featured in the Olympics. I think board sports should have more of a presence in the Olympics because, at the end of the day, kiteboarding and windsurfing are far more available in developing countries because the entry cost is much less than it is for some of the sailing classes,"" he added. The windsurfing lobby argues that kiteboarding lacks a clear pathway from junior to professional level, something that it has worked for years to achieve. Others, like the U.S. Windsurfing blog ""saveolympicwindsurfing,"" argue that kitesurfing simply isn't safe enough at the moment and that ""handing a kid a kite is like handing them a loaded gun."" In response to these claims and many others issued by the windsurfing lobby the IKA says it has been forced to issue a document separating fact from fiction about their sport.","Windsurfing made its Olympic debut in 1984 for men and 1992 for women .

"(CNN) -- During the past few months, I have gently suggested to my patients that they receive the flu vaccine. Many said yes, but some declined. Today, as I look up Google's national flu trend map, I see nearly the entire country painted in an alarming red, signifying ""intense"" flu activity. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 41 states are experiencing widespread flu outbreaks. There are 26 times more flu cases this year than last. And in Boston, near my primary care practice, a public health emergency was declared this past Wednesday. I shake my head when seeing these headlines, and I vow to be more persuasive when it comes to giving the flu vaccine. More patients need to be protected against influenza by getting flu shots earlier in the season. Like many other clinics across the country, my office is flooded with patients suffering from coughs, runny noses, fevers and body aches, all potentially caused by the flu. Thankfully, the vast majority of adults survive. But others fare less successfully: the young, the elderly, and those with chronic conditions like asthma, diabetes or cancer. Severe flu complications, like pneumonia, can hospitalize these patients, or worse, be fatal. Consider the young. According to William Rodriguez, a pediatrician at the Food and Drug Administration, between 43 and 153 children have died in the past 10 flu seasons combined. Already, 18 children have died this season. One reason why the flu outbreak is so prevalent this year is that the predominant strain, H3N2, hasn't been this widely circulated since 2002-03 and is associated with a more severe illness. But another reason is the relatively low percentage of patients who received a flu shot. This year's vaccine is well matched to the circulating viruses and, while not perfect, provides good protection. Flu shots are about 60% effective. But more than half of Americans skip the vaccine. Only 46% received one last year. This year's numbers are about the same. The reason many cite, ""I got the flu from the flu shot!"" isn't valid. There are no live viruses in the vaccine. If someone got sick after the shot, it's because of a coincidental illness caused by the scores of other non-influenza viruses that can cause similar upper respiratory symptoms. Others say, ""I've never had the shot before, and I've been fine."" In some, the flu can be debilitating, leaving patients bedridden for days. In others, it can simply be a runny nose or a minor cough. But it's still the flu and can be spread to more vulnerable patients, with disastrous consequences for them. According to Frank Esper, a viral respiratory disease expert at UH Case Medical Center in Ohio, ""Every time you vaccinate yourself, you're not just protecting yourself, but you're protecting everyone you know, including individuals who are young or pregnant."" It's still not too late for a flu shot. Go get one if you haven't already. Although its protective action won't take effect for about two weeks, the flu season hasn't peaked. I realize I have to do a better job to dispel these myths in the exam room and convince more of my patients to receive a flu shot. But patients can also help. Read the headlines and learn from the current flu crisis. Then be proactive and get a vaccine earlier in future flu seasons. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kevin Pho.","Kevin Pho: Nearly every state has ""intense"" flu activity .

"London (CNN) -- WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange urged the world Saturday to ""stand with"" Edward Snowden, the man who admitted leaking top-secret details about U.S. surveillance programs, according to the text of a speech posted on Twitter. As he appealed for a ""brave country"" to step forward and offer Snowden asylum, Assange also accused U.S. President Barack Obama of betraying a generation of ""young, technically minded people."" Assange was scheduled to speak from the balcony of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on Saturday, but the appearance was postponed at short notice ""due to a security situation,"" WikiLeaks said on Twitter. Wednesday marked a year since Assange sought refuge in the embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning over allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another. Assange has repeatedly said the allegations in Sweden are politically motivated and tied to the work of his website. Ecuador's government granted him asylum in August, but British authorities have said they will arrest him if he leaves the premises. As a result of his decision to seek refuge in the embassy, ""I have been able to work in relative safety from a U.S. espionage investigation,"" said Assange, according to the text of the speech. ""But today, Edward Snowden's ordeal is just beginning."" Assange to Snowden: 'Go to Latin America' Assange's words came hours after Snowden was charged by U.S. federal prosecutors with espionage and theft of government property, according to a criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in Virginia on Friday. Snowden, 30, has admitted in interviews that he was the source behind the leak of classified documents about the NSA's surveillance programs. Those leaks were the basis of reports this month in Britain's Guardian newspaper and The Washington Post. He is believed to be in hiding in Hong Kong. The United States has asked authorities there to detain the former National Security Agency contract analyst on a provisional arrest warrant, The Washington Post reported, citing unnamed U.S. officials. Assange, in his published speech, said the espionage charge had come ""like clockwork,"" making Snowden the eighth ""leaker"" to be charged with that count by the Obama administration. ""Two dangerous runaway processes have taken root in the last decade, with fatal consequences for democracy,"" he said. ""Government secrecy has been expanding on a terrific scale. Simultaneously, human privacy has been secretly eradicated ... The U.S. government is spying on each and every one of us, but it is Edward Snowden who is charged with espionage for tipping us off."" Also among the eight ""leakers"" is WikiLeaks source Bradley Manning, Assange said. Manning is being court-martialed on charges he aided U.S. enemies by leaking documents he obtained as an Army intelligence analyst. Prosecutors: Bradley Manning 'craved' notoriety . He named the others as Barrett Brown, Jeremy Hammond, Aaron Swartz, Gottfrid Svartholm and Jacob Appelbaum. Assange suggested Obama was the real ""traitor"" for his failure to live up to his promises of hope, change and transparency in government. And he warned that the U.S. government will lose the battle if it tries to take on the tech-savvy people now calling its actions into question. ""Edward Snowden is one of us. Bradley Manning is one of us. They are young, technically minded people from the generation that Barack Obama betrayed. They are the generation that grew up on the Internet, and were shaped by it,"" he said. ""The U.S. government is always going to need intelligence analysts and systems administrators, and they are going to have to hire them from this generation and the ones that follow it. ""One day, they will run the CIA and the FBI. This isn't a phenomenon that is going away."" Assange added that charging Snowden ""is intended to intimidate any country that might be considering standing up for his rights"" and appealed for efforts to find asylum for him to be intensified.

CNN's Susannah Palk contributed to this report.","Assange says President Obama has betrayed a generation, according to the text of a speech .

"(CNN) -- The Israeli air force conducted a strike in Lebanon between Beirut and Sidon on Friday, a day after rockets struck northern Israel, the Israeli Defense Forces said Friday. There were no casualties in the Israeli strike, which stirred memories of the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite militant group. The IDF described the launch of rockets targeting Israel as a ""terrorist aggression originating from Lebanese territory."" Lebanon's National News Agency said the Israeli strike occurred at dawn Friday in al-Naama, about 15 kilometers (10 miles) south of Beirut. Cross-border fire has been rare since the Israel-Hezbollah war. The IDF believes that global jihadist elements were behind the rocket fire on Thursday into Israel, which was launched from a village south of the Lebanese city of Tyre, IDF spokesman Eytan Buchman said. The strike hit a site belonging to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, according to Lebanon's National News Agency. The group has long been a pro-Syrian government movement. The cross-border fire comes amid anxiety in Lebanon over the Syrian civil war. A bombing near a mosque killed at least 13 people in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli, where there has been sectarian division over Syria. Popular Front official Abu Imad Ramez Mustafa confirmed the Israeli raid, adding that ""the raid targeted the valley and did not target PFLP sites."" ""Israel has always sought strife,"" he was quoted as saying by the Lebanese news agency. The Popular Front General Command maintains facilities in the area, and the National News Agency said a network of tunnels belonging to the group was hit. The Israeli attack comes in response to an attack Thursday in which four rockets were fired from southern Lebanon at northern Israel, with two of them landing in populated areas, the Israel Defense Forces said. It wasn't immediately clear where the two rockets landed. They caused property damage, but no one was hurt, the Israeli military said. One rocket was intercepted by Israel's missile defense system between the northern Israeli cities of Nahariya and Acre, the IDF said. Information on the fourth rocket wasn't immediately available. Earlier, the military said that all the rockets besides the intercepted one fell outside Israeli territory. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised his nation would respond. The attack prompted a halt to all civilian aerial activity in northern Israel, the IDF's Buchman said.","Popular Front confirms attack, says there were no casualties .

"(CNN) -- A California elementary school principal, arrested in connection with her husband's death, was released from custody Tuesday after a court hearing for her was postponed and the time expired that she could be held without being charged. She was to be released with no formal charges filed as prosecutors waited for more information from the Kern County, California, sheriff's department, according to information confirmed by Kern County District Attorney David Zulfa. Leslie Jenea Chance, principal of an elementary school in Bakersfield, was arrested late Thursday. The body of her husband, Todd Chance, was found August 25 in an almond orchard in Bakersfield, a city about 100 miles north of Los Angeles. His black Ford Mustang was found abandoned in a residential area. ""We do believe she is the person who drove that car to the neighborhood, then dropped it off, then walked away from the vehicle,"" Ray Pruitt, a spokesman for the Kern County Sheriff's Office, said after the arrest. An arraignment hearing was scheduled for Tuesday, but the hearing was postponed. Zulfa confirmed to CNN that Chance's release was pending Tuesday afternoon, with the time expiring that she could be held without formal charges filed.

"(CNN) -- A country girl finding her feet in the big (Emerald) city, Dorothy Gale is one of the most enduring and endearing characters in movie history. Part of what she discovers on her voyage over the rainbow is that apparently heroic, magical and/or much-admired folk -- such as the Wizard of Oz -- will probably turn out to be no better than anybody else. Now that I'm a parent, I realize that Oz is the father figure in the movie: He's not a bad man but not someone who can solve all his children's problems for them, either. All he can really do is appreciate them for who they are, so that they learn to appreciate themselves. But is Oz someone we care to know more about? Maybe. As much as I enjoyed Sam Raimi's new movie, which is breezy and bright in myriad dimensions, I doubt his story will exert a comparable hold on the popular imagination for generations to come. Dads just aren't that interesting -- not even to other dads. L. Frank Baum wrote 13 sequels to his most popular novel, but so far as I know, he never hit on the idea of a prequel. Ingeniously scripted by Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire, ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" mimics the movement and character arc of the original. It begins in the Midwest in black-and-white and then falls to a Technicolor Neverland in the eye of a twister. But we're no longer watching Dorothy, an innocent abroad. Instead, we have James Franco's Oscar Diggs (""Oz"" for short), a charismatic charlatan and a two-bit showman with an eye for the ladies -- any lady, really; wiccans welcome! If there's a throne and a treasure trove at the end of the rainbow, maybe he'll stick around the next morning. He's not all heel, though. At least he has the decency to be embarrassed that he's not the magical savior everyone seems to be expecting. He says he aspires to greatness, even if he never seems likely to stretch for it. Franco doesn't quite get there, for me, in this role. He's an unconvincing fraud and a shaky charlatan -- too young, perhaps, to fool anyone except himself. Or, maybe he's just too contemporary to pass as a 19th century illusionist. Reportedly, Robert Downey Jr. and Johnny Depp turned down the role, and either might have played him with more aplomb. Presumably they were wary of messing with a solid gold classic, but while ""Oz"" does present a wide target for critics, they shouldn't have worried: Director Sam Raimi (""The Amazing Spider-Man,"" ""The Evil Dead"") takes care to honor the original in spirit and in style. It may be an impossible job, but he's surpassed reasonable expectations. The production design and the saturated colors are close enough that this movie really does work as a prequel (albeit in 3-D), and while the CGI is unmistakably 21st century, Raimi's unironic celebration of pure artifice does suggest a continuum of sorts. Today's fashion for green screen and chroma key is not so far removed from the back projection and studio sets of Hollywood's Golden Age. Because the Land of Oz exists outside our reality, even the most ersatz effects -- butterfly trees and flowers that toll like bells -- are fair game. In this place of garish, unnatural wonders and exotic fauna (Zach Braff turns up in the form of a diminutive winged monkey), the bewildered magician is swept off his feet by not one, but three magnificent witches -- Mila Kunis, Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams -- one after the other, each appealing to his better judgment and worst instincts, and none copping to the wickedness that we know will show its hand eventually. Will our flawed hero measure up to the fix in which he finds himself? And how, with nothing but an army of peaceniks to counter the witches' Winkies? The new ""Oz"" falls short of the 1939 ""Oz"" in charm and innocence and certainly in songs (there is only one, a brief, jokey number from the Munchkins). But as family entertainment, it's hard to fault such a rapturous spectacle and astute, suspenseful piece of storytelling. A true fantasist, Raimi has conjured up a valentine to the imagination, to smoke and mirrors and to the movies as a magical space where we might envisage, and possibly even realize, our better selves. That's more than good enough.","Sam Raimi's ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is a prequel to ""Wizard of Oz""

"(CNN) -- As explosions and gunfire continued to ripple in Syria, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights on Monday raised the death toll from the Damascus government's crackdown on anti-regime activists to close to 5,000 people. ""This situation is intolerable,"" Navi Pillay said in a briefing for the U.N. Security Council. The same day that Pillay spoke, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and a resident of Homs -- an opposition hotbed and frequent site of violence in recent months -- reported that a gas pipeline exploded near the city, followed by gunfire and circulating military airplanes. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency, or SANA, played up local elections Monday as an expression of ""democracy and free will."" Yet the Homs resident said there was no evidence of voting in that city. Instead, this witness reported nonstop shooting and bombardments. Such violence is nothing new in Syria, with Pillay reporting more than 200 people have died in the last 10 days, and ""the Syrian population continues to live in fear of further violent repression."" The Syrian government, meanwhile, has consistently blamed the violence on ""armed terrorist"" gang members and denied any efforts to target peaceful civilians. CNN cannot independently confirm events because the Syrian government restricts access of international media to the country. Pillay said Monday that ""the nature and scale of abuses"" indicate that Syrian forces likely committed ""crimes against humanity."" Citing reliable sources, she said more than 300 of the dead have been children ""killed by state forces."" Several defectors from military and security forces said they got orders ""to shoot unarmed protesters without warning,"" according to Pillay. ""Independent, credible and corroborated accounts demonstrate that these abuses have taken place as part of a widespread and systematic attack on civilians,"" she said. Homs has been a regular flash point. As nightfall arrived Monday, many city residents went to bed afraid the steady waves of violence could soon give way to a historic siege. Opposition figures said the Syrian government had warned people in Homs to stop anti-government protests, hand in weapons and surrender defecting military members by Monday night -- or face attack by government forces. Syrian forces gave a 72-hour warning, said Lt. Col. Mohamed Hamdo of the Free Syrian Army, an opposition group of defected Syrian military personnel. Activists on the ground said the ultimatum was issued Friday for Homs. The government has not acknowledged any deadline for Homs in state-run media. Hamdo said there are concerns about a repeat of what happened in 1982, when Syria's military -- acting under orders from then-President Hafez al-Assad, father of current Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad -- launched an assault on the city of Hama, killing thousands. ""People are very afraid,"" said Wissam Tarif, a human rights activist in Beirut, Lebanon, with the organization Avaaz, who is in touch with people in Syria. There are enough troops around Homs ""to take over the city,"" he said, and casualties have been increasing ""in very big numbers"" over the past couple of days. Hamdo said the military has dug trenches around Homs and largely cut it off. ""There is no electricity, water, and the communication lines are much worse. The food supply is also decreasing, mainly because little food is going in,"" he said. The Syrian government denied reports of water and electricity being out in the city, according to a SANA report. In fact, besides a story about seven ""army, security and police martyrs"" being buried Monday, state-run media did not report much on such dire conditions or violence. Rather, state TV painted a picture of normalcy, with reports of local elections under way across the country. SANA noted that more than 3,000 candidates are vying for seats in the Homs region alone. It billed the elections as part of the ""process of building institutions, promoting democracy and achieving the comprehensive reform process led by President Bashar al-Assad."" Activist groups, though, offered a different story. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists in the country, said Monday the Syrian army and security forces killed 21 people, including four women and three children. Thirteen of the deaths were in Homs, three were in Hama, three in Damascus suburbs and two in Idlib. And fierce clashes broke out between security forces and defectors in the cities of Daraa and Idlib, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which collects information from people in different parts of the country. Hamdo, from the Free Syrian Army said, ""We conducted an operation late last night against the Syrian forces in Idlib and killed eight of them and injured 22. Two of our men are critically injured."" He also said Syrian forces were conducting mass arrests of shop owners who shut their stores Sunday as part of a nationwide anti-government strike. The Syrian government, via SANA, on Sunday quoted people saying there was no strike and no sign of a strike. The last nine months has seen a steady stream of clashes, amid reported government push-back against activists demanding democratic elections and the end of al-Assad's regime. Al-Assad has been in power since 2000; his father ruled Syria for three decades. World leaders and diplomats have widely condemned Syria's crackdown and called on it to halt violence against the opposition. The Arab League announced it will hold emergency meetings this week in Cairo. In a statement on Egypt's state-run MENA news agency, an Arab League official said leaders will ""discuss the Arab response to a message from Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem to approve the signing of an agreement on an Arab League observing mission to Syria with conditions."" Pillay's report especially drew strong responses from representative countries' ambassadors to the United Nations. Britain's ambassador, Mark Lyall Grant, called it ""the most horrifying briefing that we've had in the Security Council over the last two years,"" citing the thousands of deaths and ""tens of thousands of detentions, rapes, torture (and) violations of abuses right across the system by the Syrian regime. German Ambassador Peter Wittig said his country is ""shocked and appalled"" by the U.N. human rights branch's view of the situation, calling it ""unbearable"" that the Security Council appears ""condemned to remain silent on Syria."" ""We share the assessment that the Syrian security forces have committed crimes against humanity this year,"" he said. ""And we believe that the Syrian authorities have failed their international obligations of human rights law."" CNN's Yousuf Basil, Hamdi Alkhshali, Amir Ahmed, Josh Levs and Richard Quest and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","NEW: Activists and a resident report a pipeline explosion and gunfire in Homs .

"(CNN) -- While the trials and tribulations of Lindsey Vonn have dominated skiing headlines this season, one of her rivals has been quietly carving out her own place in the history books. Tina Maze is already far ahead in the race to usurp Vonn as overall World Cup champion, and on Sunday she joined the American as one of only six female skiers to win a race in each of the alpine sport's five disciplines. The Slovenian won the first Super G event held in the Austrian resort of St. Anton in 14 years to move 550 points clear of closest rival Maria Hoefl-Riesch. ""I'm not really concerned about making history when I get prepared for a race, but it is always a nice thing to hear once it's done,"" the 29-year-old told the FIS World Cup website after her sixth win this season. ""I've worked hard to win my first Super G, I got very close to winning last season. I could not have made it if there wasn't such a good team of people around me. The summer preparation was conducted in the best way possible and it's been paying off so far."" It was Maze's 17th World Cup win overall, still a long way off Vonn's leading 57. ""It's amazing to see Tina do so well. She's been on a roll -- top three in every event. She's clearly running away with the overall. It's cool to watch. I think it's great for the sport and I'm really happy for her,"" Vonn said. The four-time World Cup champion won the first two Super G races this season, but then took a month off due to stomach problems. Vonn returned to action in Saturday's downhill at St. Anton, finishing equal sixth -- and improved by two places to retain a 20-point lead over Maze in the Super G standings. ""I think that it was a good weekend to reconstruct my season,"" said Vonn, whose divorce from husband Thomas Vonn after a year of separation came through last week. ""I rediscovered my confidence. I am really eager to get to Cortina. I think that next weekend will see me in better form."" Maze headed off Austria's Anna Fenninger, while Switzerland's Fabienne Suter was third in her best result since returning from a serious knee injury. Meanwhile, Marcel Hirscher extended his overall lead in the men's World Cup with victory in the slalom at Adelboden to repeat his 2012 victory at the Swiss resort. The Austrian was beaten by Ted Ligety on Saturday when the American took advantage of his rival's mistake to win the giant slalom, but this time Hirscher recovered from eighth place in the opening run to beat compatriot Mario Matt and third-placed Italian Manfred Moelgg. Hirscher is now 126 points ahead of second-placed Norwegian Aksel Lund Svindal, with Ligety 179 adrift in third.","Tina Maze becomes sixth woman skier to win a race in all five World Cup disciplines .

"(CNN) -- So you got a flu vaccine this season, and you've been reading about the flu epidemic. You might be wondering: Will the vaccine keep me healthy? The answer: The vaccine isn't a guarantee that you'll be flu-free. In fact, it's about 62% effective, said the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Thomas Frieden, on Friday. It can prevent the flu, and it can be beneficial even if you do get sick, said Dr. Bill Schaffner, chairman of the preventive medicine department at Vanderbilt University's School of Medicine. ""It's the best vaccine we have, but there are cases of influenza that occur despite immunization,"" Schaffner said on ""CNN Newsroom"" Thursday morning. The effectiveness of the vaccine depends, in part, on how well it matches the strains of viruses that actually end up prevailing during the flu season. So far, according to the CDC, this year's North American vaccine matches well with the most predominant type of flu spreading in the United States, but is less well matched to the No. 2 type of virus. This year's North American vaccine is made from three viruses: two types of influenza A virus (H3N2 and H1N1) and an influenza B virus. As of January 5, the CDC said Friday, the predominant virus in the United States was an influenza A (H3N2) virus that matched well with the H3N2 virus represented in the vaccine. Of the H3N2 viruses tested at that point, 99.4% matched the type that the vaccine protects against. The match for influenza B viruses, the second-most common this season, wasn't as good. Of the influenza B viruses tested between October 1 and January 5, 66.7% were the type represented in the vaccine. The match for H1N1, much rarer this season, was 100%, the CDC said. Of the viruses collected and tested in the United States in early January, 20.2% were influenza B and the rest were influenza A -- the vast majority of which appeared to be of the H3 variety, according to the CDC. The vaccine generally works better ""in young, healthy people than it does in older persons,"" Schaffner said. The CDC concurs: Even when vaccinated, some older people and people with certain chronic illnesses might not develop the same high levels of immunity as healthy, young adults, the CDC says on its website. What to do if you have the flu . But even if it doesn't prevent illness in a particular person, the vaccine still can mitigate some of the symptoms. ""(Flu vaccines) are often of benefit because they can prevent some of the complications. It makes a more serious infection somewhat milder,"" Schaffner said. Keep in mind that the vaccine doesn't work right away. ""It takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body and provide protection against the flu,"" the CDC's website says. Opinion: In the future, get vaccinated earlier . It's not too late to get a flu shot, Schaffner said. ""Influenza is going to be with us into February and even beyond. If you haven't been vaccinated, please, take advantage of the benefits of influenza vaccine,"" he said. ""Run, do not walk -- get the vaccine. Protect yourself and everyone around you."" National Institutes of Health: It's an epidemic . If you did get the vaccine but still came down with the flu, you might wonder if the vaccine caused the illness. It did not, Schaffner said. ""You can get a bit of a sore arm if you get the injection. If you get the nasal spray variety, you can have a sore throat for a day and a runny nose. But you can't get flu from the flu vaccine,"" he said. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN chief medical correspondent, endorsed getting a flu vaccine and frequently washing your hands. ""With soap and water, wash your hands for two 'Happy Birthday' songs,"" he advised in an interview on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360Ëš."" If you have the flu, how are you treating it? Send photos of your flu survival kits. CNN's Carol Costello and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","NEW: Vaccine is about 62% effective, CDC director says .

"(CNN) -- South African activist Zackie Achmat is a fighter at heart who's been marching against injustice all his life. From protesting against the apartheid regime to championing gay rights, Achmat advocates for those who he believes don't have a voice. An openly gay, HIV-positive male, Achmat has battled tirelessly to improve access to affordable treatment for people with HIV/AIDS and even risked his life for the cause. Today, the 49-year-old is most passionate about his work in South Africa's townships, where he's on a mission to bring better, safer public facilities to poor residents. CNN's Robyn Curnow caught up with Achmat to discuss his battle for social justice. An edited version of the interview follows. CNN: Are you the kind of person who needs to fight against something, who needs to rally against authority? Zackie Achmat: No, I'm exactly the opposite. I'm the sort of person -- I really hope -- who tries to change things and who gives people a sense of dignity, of their own humanity. CNN: Anti-retroviral drugs are life saving and you used access to them to shame the South African government and have them given to ordinary poor people. Tell me about that process. ZA: It was a multi-prong process that we did. The main (element) was educating people at community levels about the relevance of anti-retrovirals. The second was using the courts -- especially the high court, constitutional court -- to enforce people's rights. And then of course (there was) the need for a treatment plan and fighting the drug companies to bring those prices down. CNN: You refused to take anti-AIDS drugs even though you could, to make a point that 'listen, I might die in this fight until ordinary people get it.' ZA: It was for about four and a half years, and again it's something that caused enormous pain for my friends and my comrades and so on. But the thing I'll always remember was one day a very, very poor woman came up to me and she grabbed my hand at a demonstration and said: 'What you're doing is keeping me alive.' And I knew that it was a terrible burden to carry, I've never said this, but it was a terrible burden to carry, but at the same time it was the right thing to do . CNN: Did you go to bed at night and think, 'should I just take these drugs?' Were you prepared to die? ZA: Yes! But it's the sort of thing you put out of your head -- you prepare yourself, I was very much prepared to be dead, in a certain sense I was performing the holy martyr publicly. And in 2003 when I started taking my medicines, all that changed completely. I had to prepare for life, I made plans and my life changed phenomenally. CNN: You're still fighting for basic social rights. ZA: All people who live in South Africa have to deal with the crime and safety situation...the basic things, safe toilets, safe streets, safe lights, after school care and that's what the Social Justice Coalition which I'm part of (advocates for.) We went this morning... and people get raped when they go to the toilet. (There are) 20 to 30 to 70 people sharing a toilet, toilets that aren't cleaned by the municipality, toilets that are broken, sewerage running all through people's homes on occasion, but the most dangerous thing (for) a person in the informal settlement is (to) go to a toilet. CNN: You've fought for social justice for your whole life. Where South Africa is now, is it what you fought for as a 15-year-old, is this what you wanted? ZA: South Africa for me now is in a certain sense immeasurably better off than ever before, immeasurably. The dignity that black people to a degree have -- no black person has to lose their family and go to jail for it like we did under the past laws, so that's one sense of it. On the other hand the social and class inequalities are much, much wider and much more dangerous for our society. The question we all have to ask ourselves is whether we have postponed our civil war or whether we have avoided it. Because the civil war happens daily in people's lives when they can't go to a toilet safely, whether that is going to become a public thing is a different matter. And unless we address jobs, education and crime, we're not going to be able to contain our society as a society. CNN: So the fight continues. ZA: It's a struggle, the struggle continues and I like, I prefer the word struggle, because it has two connotations: it has the connotation of political struggle but it also has the connotation of what people do daily in order to survive. And it's the connecting of those two that is the most important struggle in life, the struggle to be an ethical human being.","Zackie Achmat is a prominent South African political activist .

"(CNN) -- I've often said I'd like to smother my entire body in soy sauce. But enough about my eHarmony profile. The truth is I'm completely smitten with one particular sauce from Trader Joe's called Island Soyaki. It's a little gift from heaven made with pineapple and ginger and garlic and sesame seeds. And if given half a chance I'm fairly certain it could ultimately lead to world peace. ""Damn, this is delicious! Why are we even fighting?"" ""Your God is different than our God."" ""Ah, right. That."" Perhaps it'll take more than just Island Soyaki to bring us all together. But it's a starting point. Unfortunately, however, the revolution won't begin in Canada -- because they don't have Trader Joe's. Instead, what they do have in Vancouver, British Columbia, is a place called Pirate Joe's, which is an ""unaffiliated unauthorized re-seller of Trader Joe's products."" Essentially, it's like an eBay store for chocolate-covered nuts. (I'm pretty sure there's also a place for that on Craigslist. But it's waaaaay different. So I've heard.) Naturally, this imposter store is now being sued. Trader Joe's, who declined to comment for this article, filed their complaint in Washington state in May. Then, earlier this month, lawyers for Pirate Joe's fought back, delivering a motion to dismiss. And that's when the whole thing finally made news all over the Web. It's a good old fashioned food fight! Basically, Trader Joe's isn't too pleased that the owner of Pirate Joe's literally crosses the border into America, purchases tons of food from their stores, hauls it all back to British Columbia, and then re-sells it for a higher price. Of course, Pirate Joe's doesn't feel they're doing anything legally wrong -- it's the basic principles of import/export, and their website specifically points out that they even ""add Canadian compliant ingredient and nutrition facts labels."" Calories 110 (Sorry.) Fat 7 g (Sorry.) Cholesterol 30 mg (Sorry.) So, as someone with six functioning brain cells and zero business sense, I have to ask: What's the problem? Because, really, it all seems very win-win-win. Trader Joe's sells a lot of product. Pirate Joe's makes a little money. And people in Vancouver can have soup from a box. Ain't life grand? Let's all get naked in a tub of Island Soyaki! But apparently it's not that simple, for this is about trademark infringement, false advertising and a host of other legal issues arguing that Pirate Joe's hurts the Trader Joe's brand. (That said, life is still pretty grand. And I'm totally game for filling up the tub.) Now, what makes this all so truly weird and amazing is that the owner of Pirate Joe's, Michael Hallatt, calls himself Trader Joe's ""best customer,"" and claims to have spent more than $350,000 with them over the past two years to supply his similarly-themed shop in Vancouver. And Trader Joe's is basically saying, ""Hey, thanks for giving us heaps of money. But go to hell."" Because, clearly, it's not about earnings. It's about branding. Trader Joe's has worked hard to create a positive public image, and they certainly have every right to protect that. To Hallatt's credit, though, he has at least stopped selling perishable goods, for he says he understands that if something were to spoil, it could lead to health risks that might tarnish the reputation of Trader Joe's. So, he really is trying. But with all the legal back and forth, things are getting rather intense. So much so, in fact, that Hallatt recently dropped the ""P"" from the name on his store front so that it reads _IRATE JOE'S. Which is to say, he's not overjoyed about the lawsuit. On top of that, running his business has become increasingly difficult. Some Trader Joe's stores in the Pacific Northwest have begun asking him to leave. So he's resorted to shopping with cash while dressed in drag so as not to be noticed. I do it to feel pretty. Anyway, it's all sort of a moot point for me here in America. Trader Joe's is right down the street from my house, their shelves are always stocked with plenty of Island Soyaki, and a red, white and blue bald eagle soars over my really large tub.

"(CNN) -- Usain Bolt has a simple message following a string of doping scandals that have cast a shadow over athletics and Jamaican sport: ""I'm clean."" A six-time Olympic gold medalist, Bolt was speaking publicly for the first time since his fellow Jamaican and elite sprinter Asafa Powell and Tyson Gay of the United States tested positive for banned substances. ""If you were following me since 2002 you would know that I have been doing phenomenal things since I was 15,"" the 100 meter and 200 meter world record holder told reporters ahead of this weekend's Diamond League meeting in London. ""I was the youngest person to win the world junior title at 15, I ran the world junior record at 18, the world youth record at 17. ""I have broken every record there is to break, in every event I have ever done. For me, I have proven myself since I was 15. For me, I have shown I was always going to be great."" ""I was made to inspire people and to run. I was given a gift and that's what I do. I'm confident in myself and my team, the people I work with. And I know I am clean."" Powell became the second high-profile Jamaican sprinter to fail a drugs test in a matter of weeks. Veronica Campbell-Brown, a a triple Olympic gold medalist, was given a provisional suspension in June. Powell, Campbell-Brown and Gay deny knowingly taking banned substances, as does Jamaican Sherone Simpson who also tested positive. Blog: Lifetime bans the only way to deter dopers? Bolt revealed he had sent a text message to Powell, telling his compatriot ""to stay strong and focused."" ""There are a lot of details yet to be discussed so I'm just sitting and waiting to see the results and what's what,"" added Bolt. ""There are a lot of things that haven't been done and haven't been said so I'm just waiting to see what is going on. ""You have to be very careful as an athlete because right now there are a lot of things on the banned list. You have to keep up to date all of the time. It's hard but that's why you have a team to help you out with this kind of thing."" Away from athletics, Jamaican sport was rocked by a fresh doping scandal after one of the Caribbean nation's footballers become the latest sporting figure to fail a drugs test. The unnamed footballer failed a test carried out by the sport's global governing body FIFA following last month's World Cup qualifying match against Honduras. ""During the World Cup Qualifying match, Honduras vs Jamaica, on June 11, 2013 a member of the Jamaican squad returned an adverse analytical finding on his urine sample,"" read a statement from the Jamaican Football Federation (JFF). ""The testing was carried out by the FIFA. This means that the ensuing process will be managed by the FIFA. The player has been informed and we await further information from the FIFA.

"Baghdad (CNN) -- A barrage of attacks struck Monday across Iraq, killing at least 84 people and wounding more than 200, said officials, who likened the attacks to another outbreak last year. ""Once again, murderers and criminals have carried out attacks against innocent civilians to add a new page to their black criminal record,"" Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said in a written statement. He called on security forces to ""not let the killers catch their breath,"" and to pursue them ""until they finish them."" Some of the 21 reported bombings and shootings targeted police and security forces, while others targeted civilians. It was the worst wave of violence to strike the country in months, taking place on the halfway mark of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. ""Today's attacks are eerily similar to the stream of large-scale, complex attacks that occurred here last year during Ramadan on August 25,"" said Maj. Angela Funaro, spokeswoman for United States Forces-Iraq. Officials believe last year's attacks were carried out by al Qaeda in Iraq ""to shake the public's confidence in the capabilities of the ISF (Iraqi Security Forces) to defend this country,"" but it is too early to speculate about who may have been behind Monday's attacks, Funaro said in an e-mail. A posting Monday on a jihadist website praised the attacks against ""Shiites, Christians, and the apostate Awakening Councils."" The post did not include a claim of responsibility. Awakening Councils are made up of former Sunni militants now in the pay of the Iraqi government, which have been credited with helping reduce violence. They are also frequent targets of assassination attempts. The attacks come weeks after Iraq's political leaders agreed to request U.S. troops stay beyond a January 1, 2012, deadline to withdraw. While the United States pulled its combat troops last year, between 46,000 and 50,000 troops have remained to provide support and training. The United States is widely expected to agree to some kind of limited extension of training personnel and equipment. Last week, Muqtada al-Sadr, the influential Iraqi Shiite cleric staunchly opposed to U.S. troop presence, warned against the prospects of a ""challenge"" with any U.S. forces that may stay in Iraq. His Mehdi army militia was a major factor in the sectarian violence that erupted during the height of the war. Al-Maliki said Monday's attacks ""cannot undermine the resolve of our citizens and our armed forces."" Monday's violence ended a period of calm that began about the same time as Ramadan. Ministry of Interior officials called on security forces to ban people from parking their vehicles on the streets of cities targeted in the attacks, saying they feared more violence. In Tikrit, north of Baghdad, officials imposed a curfew on vehicles until further notice after a fatal suicide attack, officials with the Interior Ministry said. Funaro said Iraq forces requested U.S. assistance only in Tikrit, and added that U.S. forces ""are prepared to assist in any capacity"" in line with the security agreement in place. Two suicide bombers targeted security forces in Tikrit -- Saddam Hussein's hometown -- killing at least four policemen and wounding 11, the two officials said. The deadliest of Monday's attacks was a double bombing that targeted civilians on a busy street in central Iraq, authorities said. At least 37 people were killed when a car bomb followed by a roadside bomb exploded on the commercial street in Kut during morning rush hour, according to health officials and police, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information to the media. Sixty-five people were wounded in the attack, Dr. Dhiya al-Deen Jalil, the head of the health directorate in Kut, told CNN. In Twareej, near the southern holy city of Karbala, a car bomb exploded near a police station, killing at least eight people and wounding 20, two officials at the Interior Ministry told CNN. The officials also spoke on condition of anonymity for the same reason as the police. A string of explosions rocked Baghdad, killing at least three people and wounding 34, the officials said. Among the attacks were two car bombings that targeted an Iraqi army patrol and an Education Ministry convoy, the officials said. In Yusufiya, about 35 kilometers south of Baghdad, gunmen wearing Iraqi army uniforms entered a Sunni mosque around 9:30 p.m. and summoned seven worshipers by name to step outside the mosque and form a line, said an Interior Ministry official who was not authorized to speak to the news media. The gunmen then fatally shot the seven, who were members of a local Awakening Council. A bomb in a parked car in Najaf killed 11 people and wounded 50. Another parked car bomb in Kirkuk killed one person and wounded eight. A motorcycle rigged with explosives detained at an Iraqi police patrol in central Kirkuk wounded seven people. In Baquba, a suicide car bomb, another car bomb, and a shooting attack killed 13 people. Four roadside bombs exploded in Mosul, wounding five people. In the Sunni-dominated Anbar province, a man building a bomb in his house in Falluja inadvertently detonated it, killing his own 5-year-old son and wounding his wife and three other children, police and health officials in Falluja said.  The man was later arrested. While violence in Iraq has fallen off in recent years, there has been an increase in attacks targeting civilians and U.S. and Iraqi security forces in recent months. Stuart Bowen, the U.S. official in charge of overseeing reconstruction in Iraq, said the country was more dangerous last month than it was the year before, according to an agency report to Congress in July. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","84 are killed and more than 200 wounded, according to reports from across Iraq .

The Guardian, a British newspaper, and the Washington Post reported Thursday that U.S. intelligence agencies had access to the central servers of nine of the country's biggest technology firms including Microsoft, Apple, Google, Yahoo and Facebook. The Post reported the program -- called PRISM -- underwent ""exponential growth"" since its founding in 2007. In fact, the newspaper said the program has become the leading source of raw material for the National Security Agency, the secretive U.S. intelligence operation that monitors electronic communications. Yet several tech giants whose servers were reportedly ensnared in the program denied any knowledge of it Thursday. And James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, questioned the Guardian and Post articles in a statement Thursday night. He referred to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which he noted was recently reauthorized by Congress -- one of the bodies, along with the executive branch and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, with oversight over aspects of intelligence gathering. Section 702, Clapper added, ""is designed to facilitate the acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning non-U.S. persons located outside the United States."" ""It cannot be used to intentionally target any U.S. citizen, any other U.S. person, or anyone located within the United States,"" he said in his statement. While he made no mention of data mining, Clapper did defend the American intelligence effort generally, saying, ""Information collected under this program is among the most important and valuable foreign intelligence information we collect, and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats."" Clapper also called out the person or people behind ""the unauthorized disclosure of information about this important and entirely legal program,"" saying such apparent leaks are ""reprehensible and risks important protections for the security of Americans."" The Post reported that its reporters had been provided a detailed briefing presentation document on the PRISM program. The program has been running since 2007 and has undergone ""exponential growth"" since then, the Post reported. It is now the leading source of raw material for the National Security Agency, the secretive U.S. intelligence operation that monitors electronic communications. According to a briefing slide published by the Guardian, PRISM began with data from Microsoft in 2007. The program began collecting data from Yahoo in 2008 and from Google, Facebook and the message system PalTalk in 2009. YouTube became a source in 2010, Skype and AOL in 2011 and Apple in late 2012, the slide claims. The NSA declined to comment, but several companies -- many of them using similar language -- denied Thursday any knowledge of such a program. Microsoft, for instance, said in a statement it only provides user data when legally required and for specific accounts -- adding that ""if the government has a broader voluntary national security program to gather customer data we don't participate in it."" Jodi Seth, a spokeswoman for Facebook, said the social media giant works to ""carefully scrutinize any ... request for compliance"" and does not give government agencies ""direct access"" to its servers. Apple spokesman Steve Dowling offered a similar response -- saying Apple hands over information only when a government agency gets a court order. Dowling added that his company has never heard of PRISM. ""We disclose user data to government in accordance with the law, and we review all such requests carefully,"" a Google spokesman said in response to the stories. ""From time to time, people allege that we have created a government 'back door' into our systems, but Google does not have a 'back door' for the government to access private user data."" Even with these denials and Clapper's defense, President Barack Obama's administration has come under growing scrutiny in recent days over his record on balancing citizens' right to privacy and the government's efforts to combat terrorism. Patriot Act at center of Verizon phone log controversy . That includes news, first reported on Wednesday by the Guardian and commented on by U.S. politicians, that the FBI and National Security Agency have been collecting the phone records of millions of Americans -- specifically Verizon customers and perhaps others -- over a several year period. Days after taking office in 2009, Obama vowed, ""Transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency."" But on Thursday, the left-leaning Huffington Post conflated Obama with his predecessor George W. Bush while a New York Times editorial said ""the administration has now lost all credibility"" when it comes to overreaching in the name of fighting terrorism.

"Washington (CNN) -- On Sunday we commemorate the courage and sacrifice of 600 men and women who dared 45 years ago to take the first steps in a 54-mile march from Selma, Alabama, to the state capital, Montgomery, for the right to vote. That day, Sunday, March 7, 1965, would come to be known as ""Bloody Sunday."" As these unarmed civil rights patriots attempted to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, where fewer than one percent of eligible black voters were allowed to register, they were gassed and beaten with billy clubs by state and local police, some on horseback, ordered to break up the demonstration. Captured by television cameras and broadcast nationwide, the suffering of these nonviolent activists, 50 of whom required hospitalization, awoke the nation's consciousness to the importance of voting rights and the entire civil rights movement. Within 10 days, President Johnson would send a bill to Congress, the National Voting Rights Act of 1965, that would outlaw the discriminatory Jim Crow-era practices that had long worked to disenfranchise African-Americans and other minorities across the United States. Forty-five years later, the right for which marchers in Alabama bled remains out of reach for many Americans. In many states, minority voters encounter obstacles at every step of the voting process, from registration to casting a ballot. Last month, voting rights advocates filed suit against Virginia state election officials, following the advocates' investigation of rejected voter registration applications in 2008 from students at historically African-American Norfolk State University and the state officials' subsequent refusal to make certain voter registration records publicly available. While Virginia was rejecting minority voter registrations in 2008, Colorado was  purging voters from its registration rolls. Earlier this year, Colorado settled a lawsuit brought by Mi Familia Vota and other voting rights advocates. As a result of the Colorado suit, usage of lists of purged voters was stayed and the approximately 31,000 voters illegally removed from the registration lists were permitted to cast provisional ballots in the 2008 presidential election. Forty-five years after Bloody Sunday, another march is under way, but it aims to turn back the clock on voting rights. Last month, the South Carolina state Senate passed legislation to require voters to show a photo ID before casting a ballot -- a measure that disproportionately excludes low-income, minority, elderly, and student voters, all of whom are less likely than majority voters to have ready access to a government-issued photo ID. Meanwhile, Georgia's secretary of state has vowed to bring a federal court challenge after the U.S. Department of Justice rejected the state's proposed voter ""verification"" program to identify registrants who may not be citizens. The DOJ analysis of the program condemned it as highly inaccurate in identifying noncitizens and concluded that it would have a discriminatory effect on minority voters. Moreover, on Thursday officials in Indiana continued their fight to salvage that state's photo ID law in arguments to the state's Supreme Court, after an appellate court held that the law violates equal protection under the state Constitution. Proponents of photo ID and citizenship verification laws claim these measures are needed to protect against voter fraud. The problem with that argument is that they cannot point to any reliable evidence that fraud is a problem. All credible research and expert analysis demonstrates that voter fraud is, at best, extremely rare. And in-person voter fraud -- someone registering to vote as Mickey Mouse and then showing up at the polls claiming to be Mr. Mouse -- simply does not exist. These laws are solutions searching for a problem, with what some may describe as the unintended consequence of disenfranchising the most vulnerable voters. In some cases, however, disenfranchising voters is precisely the intended consequence. For example, the Republican National Committee just appealed a federal court's order to keep in place a 28-year-old consent agreement that prohibited the RNC from engaging in ""security programs"" that have had a disproportionate impact on minorities at the ballot box. The RNC consented to the agreement in 1982 to settle a lawsuit alleging that its so-called security measures -- such as stationing armed off-duty law enforcement officers at minority voting locations and aggressively challenging the rights of eligible minority voters to cast a ballot -- were actually voter intimidation tactics. Unable to identify a single instance of in-person voter fraud, the RNC instead argued, in part, that because the president of the United States and the U.S. attorney general are African-American, it is more likely that the government will enforce laws that safeguard against disenfranchising minority voters. In an effort to show their intentions are good, RNC lawyers note that the committee's chairman, Michael Steele, is African-American. The fact is, voting patterns continue to split along racial and party lines. Exit polls from the 2008 presidential election show that while 95 percent of African-Americans, 67 percent of Latinos, and 62 percent of Asian-Americans voted for Barack Obama nationally, only 43 percent of whites did. As the federal judge noted in this case, the RNC ""has been largely unsuccessful in its efforts to attract minority voters."" So long as these patterns endure, the RNC will continue to have what the judge termed an ""incentive"" to engage in racially motivated voter suppression. There is no doubt that we have come a long way since Bloody Sunday. Sadly, however, there is also no doubt that the need to fight for voting rights continues. Instead of going back to a dark era of our history by putting needless obstacles in front of minority voters, Congress and the states should press ahead to break down the remaining barriers that block eligible voters from exercising their constitutional rights. We should start by modernizing the voter registration system by making it more automated and keeping eligible voters on the rolls permanently. We should take voting out of the artificial confines created by a limited and literal ""Election Day"" by providing for universal early voting. To live up to our constitutional mandate to continue to form a more perfect union -- and to truly honor the brave men and women who marched and were beaten and bloodied, and especially those who were murdered defending their right to vote -- we have the duty to ensure that every eligible voter has an equal and meaningful opportunity to cast a ballot and have it counted.

"Washington (CNN) -- The sweeping health care reform law championed by President Barack Obama was upheld as constitutional by another federal appeals court Tuesday. The decision is not part of a half-dozen other appeals pending at the Supreme Court. The justices could decide this week whether to take on one or more of those legal challenges to the law. Those suits were brought by more than a two dozen states and a coalition of private groups and individuals. Tuesday's 2-1 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is a victory for the administration and its congressional supporters, but only adds to the divide among a range of federal courts over whether the law should be tossed out or severely trimmed in its scope. Three appeals court have upheld the law, while one has ruled it unconstitutional. The majority in this latest case concluded while the assertion of federal authority in the law is large, so too is the issue Congress and the president sought to tackle. ""The right to be free from federal regulation is not absolute, and yields to the imperative that Congress be free to forge national solutions to national problems, no matter how local -- or seemingly passive -- their individual origins,"" wrote Judge Laurence Silberman. It is unclear whether the high court will include this latest ruling with the other pending health care cases already on its docket. The justices have scheduled a closed-door conference Thursday to consider whether to accept one or more appeals. If they do, oral arguments would likely be held in March, with a ruling by June. One of the other challenges involves a 26-state coalition opposing the law. A federal appeals court in Atlanta, considering that suit, had earlier found a key provision of the law to be unconstitutional. The key issue is whether the ""individual mandate"" section -- requiring nearly all Americans to buy health insurance by 2014 or face financial penalties -- is an improper exercise of federal authority. The states also say that if that linchpin provision is unconstitutional, the entire law with its 450 or so sections must then be scrapped. Virginia and Oklahoma have filed separate challenges, along with other groups and individuals opposed to the law. The justices now have the discretion to either frame the case around the ""severability"" question -- whether the individual mandate section can be separated from the rest of the law -- or expand it to include other legal questions raised in the appeals. Two other appeals have split on the individual mandate's constitutionality, a ""circuit split"" that all but assures the Supreme Court will decide the matter ultimately. The states say individuals cannot be forced to buy insurance, a ""product"" they may neither want nor need. The Justice Department has countered the states' argument by saying that since every American will need medical care at some point in their lives, individuals do not ""choose"" to participate in the health care market. Federal officials cite 2008 figures of $43 billion in uncompensated costs from the millions of uninsured people who receive health services, costs that are shifted to insurance companies and passed on to consumers. Health care reform, a top Democratic priority since the Truman administration, was passed by the previous Congress in a series of virtually party-line votes. Obama signed the act into law in March 2010. The law is widely considered to be the signature legislative accomplishment of the president's first two years in office. Among other things, the measure was designed to help millions of uninsured and underinsured Americans receive adequate and affordable health care through a series of government-imposed mandates and subsidies. The federal government stated in court briefs that 45 million Americans last year were without health insurance, roughly 15% of the country's population. Critics have equated the measure to socialized medicine, fearing that a bloated government bureaucracy would result in higher taxes and diminished health care services. Opponents derisively labeled the measure ""Obamacare."" Republican leaders, who captured the House of Representatives in the midterm elections, have vowed to overturn or severely trim the law. The case decided Tuesday is Seven-Sky v. Holder (11-5047).","The ruling follows several others by appeals courts on the health reform legislations .

"(CNN) -- He is arguably the most well-known American general since MacArthur, and perhaps the most effective since Eisenhower. Now Gen. David Petraeus takes on what many believe will be his biggest challenge yet: reversing the momentum of the Taliban in Afghanistan and helping to stabilize the rickety regime of Afghan leader Hamid Karzai. Petraeus faced far more daunting challenges in Iraq when he assumed command there in early 2007. Those challenges, and how they were overcome, are worth recalling as he assumes command in Afghanistan, as they may provide some indicators of the way forward there. First, Iraq was embroiled in a vicious civil war in which Shia and Sunni civilians were showing up dead on the streets of Iraq's cities at the rate of 90 a day, some tortured in the most unspeakable manner, their heads drilled open. Iraq's Ministry of the Interior, which was nominally in charge of the country's security, itself had taken been taken over by Shia death squads. This was further complicated by the industrial-strength Sunni insurgency led by al Qaeda's vicious Iraqi affiliate. It recruited fighters from around the Middle East, who were largely responsible for an epic campaign of suicide attacks that killed thousands of Iraqis. Indeed, more suicide attacks were conducted in Iraq between 2003 and 2007 than had taken place in every other country of the world combined since 1981. The war was so violent that almost five million Iraqis -- around a fifth of the population --fled their homes for the safety of other countries or internal exile. Relatively few of those refugees have since returned. Despite the widespread perception that Afghanistan is today going to hell in a handbasket, more than five million Afghan refugees have returned home since the fall of the Taliban. Last year some 2,400 Afghan civilians died in the war -- too many, of course, but in Iraq when Petraeus took command, 3,200 civilians were dying every month, making Iraq around 15 times more violent than Afghanistan is today, when adjusted for relative population size. And contrary to the old saw that Afghans are virulently opposed to foreign forces on their soil, a BBC/ABC poll taken earlier this year -- almost a decade after the fall of the Taliban -- found that 62 percent of Afghans support international forces in their country. Contrast that with Iraq, where a BBC/ABC poll taken just two years after the U.S.-led invasion found that only one in three Iraqis supported the foreign soldiers in their country. This is a critical point in Afghanistan, as the center of gravity in a counterinsurgency is the protection of the population itself, a theory of counterinsurgency warfare that Petraeus enshrined in U.S. military doctrine, when he oversaw the work on the unglamorously named Counterinsurgency Field Manual 3-24 in 2006 at the Army's training center at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. When the final version of the Counterinsurgency Field Manual was published in December 2006, it was downloaded 1.5 million times within a month of its posting. The New York Times gave it a serious review, something of a first for a dense military tome that weighed in at some 400 pages. The doctrines in that counterinsurgency manual have driven the subsequent actions of the U.S. military both in Iraq and Afghanistan. The following points from the manual summarize its central message: ""Unsuccessful practices: overemphasize killing and capturing the enemy rather than securing and engaging the populace; conduct large-scale operations as the norm and concentrate military forces in large bases for protection."" Successful practices, according to the manual: Focus on the population, its needs, and its security, and provide amnesty and rehabilitation for those willing to support the new government. In a section titled ""Paradoxes,"" the manual made a number of recommendations that were hardly typical of prevailing U.S. military doctrine: ""Sometimes doing nothing is the best reaction"" and ""the host nation doing something tolerably is normally better than U.S. doing it well."" These commonsense prescriptions would, in time, help to change the course of the Iraq War. Petraeus, an intensely competitive officer with a Ph.D. in international relations from Princeton, assembled a brilliant staff to reassess and redirect the Iraq War. When he arrived in Baghdad, Petraeus brought with him a sense that there was a plan. And he also had the full support of President George W. Bush, with whom he held a weekly private videoconference, which was unprecedented since the president was circumventing several levels in the chain of command to speak to his field commander. Watching Petraeus's Battlefield Update Assessment, held every morning at ""Camp Victory"" in Baghdad, was to see a master at work, cajoling and cheerleading his commanders across the country via video link as they reported on every variable of the Iraqi body politic from the grandest of political issues to the minutest of water projects. The new team and new approach got American soldiers out of their bases and into the neighborhoods. It was amplified by the arrival of what would eventually become the 30,000 soldiers of the ""surge"" authorized by Bush as Petraeus took command in Iraq. Petraeus outlined his ""population-centric"" strategy in a three-page letter he distributed to all of the soldiers under his command. ""You can't commute to this fight. ... Living among the people is essential to securing them and defeating the insurgents. ... [P]atrol on foot and engage the population. Situational awareness can only be guaranteed by interacting with people face-to-face, not separated by ballistic glass."" There were also shifting dynamics on the ground in Iraq that would make the additional combat brigades of the surge a force multiplier rather than simply more cannon fodder for Iraq's insurgents. Those changes included: . • The rise of the ""Awakening"" movements -- former Sunni insurgents who signed up for security jobs paid for by the U.S. military. • Previous sectarian cleansing that forced millions of Iraqis to flee their homes, and which made it harder for the death squads to find their victims. In Baghdad, half the Sunni population had fled the city by the end of 2006. • Around the same time, efforts to register all military-age Iraqi males using biometrics such as retina scans, which created a useful database of that population. • Walls built around vulnerable neighborhoods that kept insurgents out. • Better bomb detection devices, such as drones equipped to spot subtle anomalies in roads indicating the presence of bombs; the increasing deployment of hulking armored vehicles with V-shaped hulls known as MRAPs, which are largely immune from roadside bombs; and an aggressive effort to map and target the networks of Iraq's bomb makers. All these things led to a decline in the number of deaths caused by the leading killer of U.S. soldiers -- the improvised explosive device. The number of IED attacks in Iraq dropped from almost 5,000 in 2006 to around 3,000 two years later. The PowerPoint briefing slides so beloved of the U.S. military showed the violence in Iraq peaking in almost every category in the first months of 2007 and steadily dropping after that. That decline was true across the board, including attacks by insurgents, civilian deaths, U.S. soldiers killed, Iraq security forces killed, car-bomb attacks, and IED explosions. The number of Iraqi civilians dying in sectarian violence began a sharp decline from its high of around 90 every day in December 2006, to single digits two years later. Can Petraeus and his team pull off something similar in Afghanistan? The strategy that Petraeus will pursue there will not differ in any substantial way from that pursued by outgoing Gen. Stanley McChrystal. After all, Petraeus is the principal theorist and practitioner of counterinsurgency in the U.S. military and was one of the small group of Pentagon leaders who pushed for McChrystal to be installed as the commander in Afghanistan a year ago. As Petraeus himself has sometimes said, Afghanistan could be harder than Iraq. And indeed it may be, for while the country is certainly not in the grip of a full-blown civil war as Iraq was in early 2007, it is still reeling from the effects of more than three decades of war. Also, the Taliban in Afghanistan are not a bunch of foreigners with foreign ideas as al Qaeda was in Iraq. In the rural Pashtun South of Afghanistan, the Taliban are the guys you grew up with and are much savvier about how to win, if not the support, at least the acquiescence of a sizable part of the population. The insurgents in Iraq had nothing on the scale of Pakistan's tribal regions as a safe haven, as the Taliban do now, nor did they have the world's largest supply of opium and heroin to help finance their insurgency. In Iraq, Petraeus helped stanch a terrible bloodbath and bring the country up to the level where it is a state perpetually on the edge of conflict between Kurds and Arabs or between Shias and Sunnis, but it has at least achieved some kind of tenuous peace. In Afghanistan, Petraeus must convince all sorts of constituencies, from the Afghan people, to the Pakistani military and political establishment, to the White House, to the American public, that some plausible progress is being made; that the Americans are not going to ""cut and run"" before a semi-stable Afghan government and military are in place.  And he must do that all on a timetable in which some kind of American drawdown begins in July 2011. It's as big a challenge as plugging the BP oil spill, and to do it right might take as long as reversing the environmental catastrophe that is already in progress in the Gulf -- a very long time, measured more in decades than in years. No one is better equipped to handle the challenge than Gen. David Petraeus. But as a student of history, the general is surely aware that what worked on the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates in 2007 could still crash on the shoals of reality on the banks of the Kabul and Helmand rivers several years later. As the philosopher pointed out: You can't step twice into the same river. Not even someone as talented as David Petraeus. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peter Bergen.","Gen. David Petraeus, who has a Ph.D. from Princeton, wrote the book on counterinsurgency .

"(CNN) -- Florida prosecutors have offered teenager Kaitlyn Hunt a new plea deal -- one that would keep her out of jail, even if she'd have to admit wrongdoing -- tied to charges she's facing for having sex with a then-14-year-old girl, a state attorney said Wednesday. Hunt, who turned 19 on Wednesday according to her family, is charged with two felony counts of lewd and lascivious battery after the parents of the 14-year-old went to authorities. Hunt's family says their relationship was consensual, though in Florida a person under the age of 16 is not legally able to give consent to sex. Bruce Colton, state attorney for Florida's 19th judicial circuit, told CNN that his office offered Hunt the latest plea deal in July. Under its terms, she would plead to two misdemeanor battery counts and one felony count for interference of child custody -- a charge that could be expunged later from her record -- said Colton. In exchange, Hunt would be subject to a curfew, would have to do community service and would be on probation, he added. But she would not face jail time, nor would she have to wear an ankle bracelet or have to register as a sex offender. The state attorney says he feels the plea deal addresses the concerns of Hunt, the younger teenage girl and their respective families. Hunt's lawyer replied that her client wouldn't agree to such a deal, according to Colton. But the state attorney's office is pressing the lawyer further, asking for documentation that shows Hunt talked about the arrangement with her client and that Hunt formally declined it. As of Wednesday, that last part hadn't happened, Colton said. If Hunt is convicted on all charges she's currently facing, she could go to prison for 15 years. No trial date has been set. The current offer is at least the second plea deal offered by prosecutors. Last spring, Hunt rejected one that would have required her to plead no contest to child abuse and, in return, spend two years on strict ""community control"" followed by one year of probation. ""If this case involved a boy and girl, there would be no media attention to this case,"" her attorney Julia Graves said then in a statement. ""... If this incident occurred 108 days earlier when (Hunt) was 17, we wouldn't even be here."" The case generated buzz when Hunt's family went public on Facebook, detailing their daughter's case and essentially accusing the victim's family of going after their daughter because she is gay. The victim's family said that isn't true; they are only trying to protect their teenage daughter. Sheriff: Case is about age, not gay rights . Jim and Laurie Smith have told CNN affiliate WPEC that they twice warned Hunt, who was then 18, to stop. They took action after going to their daughter's bedroom one weekend morning and discovered she was missing. ""We had no other alternative but to turn to the law, use it basically as a last resort,"" Jim Smith said. Hunt's supporters see the case differently, with some accusing the Smiths of going after the teen because of her sexual orientation. And for Hunt herself, she doesn't want to pay for a relationship that, in her opinion, was not wrong. ""I'm scared of losing my life, the rest of my life,"" she said earlier this year, ""not being able to go to college or be around kids, be around my sisters and my family."" CNN's Greg Botelho and Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.","Kaitlyn Hunt faces 2 felony counts of lewd and lascivious battery in Florida .

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- Russian energy monopoly Gazprom said Thursday it has cut off supplies of natural gas to Ukraine after a payment deadline expired. A gas-compressor and gas-holder station in Mryn, Ukraine. Gazprom said it had cut supplies to Ukraine Thursday. Gazprom had been threatening the move, saying months of negotiations with Ukraine had failed to resolve the issue of outstanding payments. The company says Ukraine owes about $2 billion for past natural gas deliveries. Ukraine also disputes the new price set by Gazprom for 2009 deliveries, which was initially more than double the price from 2008. Gazprom has reassured the rest of Europe that its natural gas supply, which runs through Ukraine, will not be affected by the dispute with Kiev. Thursday, a Gazprom spokesman said on Russian state television the company had actually increased the deliveries to the rest of the continent. ""Gazprom will continue supplying gas for its consumers in Europe at full volume,"" the company's chief executive, Alexey Miller, said. ""We have an effective transit contract."" Without natural gas, some Ukrainians could be in for chilly days and nights. The temperature at midday Thursday in Kiev was 25 degrees Fahrenheit (-4 degrees Celsius), with a forecast high of only 32 F (0 C) and snow predicted overnight.  Watch a report on Gazprom's threats to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine » . Ukraine's state-controlled energy company, Naftogaz Ukrainy, said Thursday it is ensuring domestic natural gas needs are covered by taking gas from underground storage facilities. ""All of Ukraine's consumers are fully secured,"" the company said in a statement. In Washington, the White House urged a resolution Thursday. ""The United States would like to see a restoration of normal deliveries,"" White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said. ""The parties should be resolving their differences through good-faith negotiations, without supply cutoffs."" The frigid weather is of particular concern, the White House said. ""We urge both sides to keep in mind the humanitarian implications of any interruption of gas supply in the winter,"" Johndroe said. Naftogaz Ukrainy also disputed Gazprom's claim that it owes for past deliveries, saying Thursday it has paid its debt to Gazprom in full, though it declined to give a figure. Another part of the dispute centers on Gazprom's price hike for 2009 gas deliveries. Gazprom had wanted to more than double Ukraine's payments, but Wednesday it offered a lower price. Ukraine, which currently pays about $100 per 1,000 cubic meters, balked at the figure offered, saying it simply can't afford to pay the new price. It is the second time in three years Gazprom has threatened to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine. The company made good on its threat on January 1, 2006, but turned the supply back on a day later. Russia is the world's biggest producer of natural gas and supplies Europe with more than 40 percent of its imports -- mainly via the pipelines through Ukraine. Naftogaz said in its statement Thursday that it would ensure the uninterrupted flow of Russian gas to Europe through Ukraine, but only under existing arrangements. It indicated some gas deliveries to Europe could be halted in Ukraine if Naftogaz fails to reach a new agreement with Gazprom. Although gas is still flowing to Europe, there are also concerns in Russia that the amount could be reduced if Ukraine siphons off some of the gas headed to the west. Naftogaz said it will continue negotiating with Gazprom to address the issues.","Russia's energy monopoly Gazprom cuts off gas supplies to Ukraine .

They work best if you start an hour before your cramps hit. ""Load up with a double dose and keep the blood level up,"" Haas says. (The maximum safe daily dose of ibuprofen is 2,400 milligrams, or 12 200-mg pills. Take the minimum dosage that works for you.) Right when you get your period, start with 800 mg and then go to 600 mg every six hours. But talk to your doctor if you have elevated heart disease risks; the Food and Drug Administration recently reported that all NSAIDs, except aspirin, may heighten cardiovascular risks. And remember that extended use of high dosages of aspirin or NSAIDs may cause gastrointestinal troubles. Omega-3 fats from fish oil seem to block prostaglandin production, too. And research shows that women with low intakes of omega-3s have more painful periods. While mainstream docs are mostly neutral on the idea of increasing omega-3s to fight period pain, some think it makes sense. Heat is an old-fashioned, but useful remedy for relaxing crampy muscles. Get out your heating pad, or try new nonprescription heat wraps, which last for eight hours and can be worn under clothes. Health.com: Your guide to fibroid fixes . Severe bleeding . Ten million American women have heavy bleeding, also called menorrhagia. (The average woman loses about three to four tablespoons per cycle; more than five tablespoons is considered heavy.) The fixes . NovaSure, in which a wand is inserted into the uterus through the cervix, emits energy that, in most cases, permanently removes the uterine lining. It's best for women who, like Katherine Sutherland, no longer want to have children. (Getting pregnant after having the uterine lining removed could be risky.) The five-minute procedure is done in a gynecologist's office. Many women report lighter bleeding right away. And a recent study found that after seven years, more than 95 percent stopped having periods. The 365-day birth-control pill, called Lybrel, is another way to skip monthly menstruation. Approved by the FDA in May, Lybrel has no placebo pills, so you just keep taking an active pill each day. (Breakthrough bleeding can be an issue for about 20 percent of users. And, since Lybrel contains estrogen, it's not for women who are prone to blood clots, such as smokers, who get migraines with an aura or who are over age 35 with elevated heart disease risks.) Health.com: Is it safe to ditch your period? If you'd prefer having a period, just with less bleeding, the traditional pill is also useful for curbing heavy flow. Its constant level of progesterone causes the endometrium to develop a much thinner lining. During your week of placebo pills, you get a lighter period because you shed a thinner lining over time. Another option is to have a period just four times a year: With Seasonale and Seasonique you take 84 active pills in a row. Mirena may be for you if pill-taking isn't your thing. This intrauterine device secretes progestin on a daily basis, thinning the uterine lining so there's virtually nothing to shed. ""One-third of women get no period, one-third get a much lighter period, and the other third have only irregular spotting,"" says Dan I. Lebovic, M.D., a reproductive endocrinology and fertility specialist at the University of Michigan Health System. Drawbacks? Pain during insertion, and possible cramps and bleeding for about three weeks afterward. Punishing PMS . About two-thirds of regularly menstruating women have premenstrual symptoms, says Jean Endicott, Ph.D., director of the Premenstrual Evaluation Unit at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. It could be headaches, breast tenderness, or big, unpleasant mood swings. Up to 8 percent of women who have PMS suffer mood changes severe enough to cause problems in their personal lives and daily routines; this more serious version of PMS is called premenstrual dysphoric disorder, or PMDD. The fixes Calcium supplements are a good first thing to try, Endicott says, because research shows they ease symptoms. (Calcium may help even out hormone levels, although no one knows for sure why it works.) Besides, most women don't get enough calcium in their diets anyway. She suggests 1,200 mg daily, and not just on the day you're PMS-ing. ""It should help take the edge off"" over time, Endicott says. Daily exercise -- like fast walking, lifting weights, or even dancing -- may be the last thing you want to do when in the throes of PMS, but it has proven antidepressant and antianxiety effects. Antidepressants (Paxil, Prozac, Sarafem, and Zoloft, to name a few) can relieve severe symptoms. The new twist is that you don't have to take one daily -- but instead as soon as you feel anxious. ""We tell (women who choose this option) to put a red flag on the calendar noting when they're likely to have symptoms so they remember to take the medication beforehand, when it can be most effective,"" Endicott says. Another choice: Yaz, a birth-control pill that's FDA-approved to treat PMDD. Clinical trials show it can cut symptoms by at least half, though the reasons are unclear. Gastro upsets . Many women have diarrhea, gas, or constipation during their periods. Prostaglandins, the chemicals that cause cramping in your uterus, do the same in your bowels. ""For lots of women, it's common to have a loose stool or diarrhea on the day they have a lot of bleeding,"" says Leslie Miller, M.D., University of Washington-Seattle clinical associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology. The fixes . Fiber can help keep GI issues under control. Aim for 30 grams a day from cereal, fruit with the skin, and vegetables. But don't add fiber to your diet too fast when you get your period; that could worsen diarrhea. For constipation, check your habits. Miller says women often hold in bowel movements because they're in public places. Before you know it, you are bloated and constipated. ""When you get the urge, go,"" Miller advises. Ibuprofen and other similar anti-inflammatory medicines may reduce gastro cramping. To avoid tummy irritation, take it with food. All of the above . Some women experience a combo of excessive bleeding, cramping, breast tenderness, headaches, PMS, and other troubles. What to do? The fix . Stop treating the individual symptoms. Miller recommends continuous birth control pills -- you just skip the placebo week and move on to your next pack. If your insurer won't pay for that, ask about Lybrel and the other pill options. Also, consider NovaSure if childbearing isn't in your future. E-mail to a friend . Enter to win a monthly Room Makeover Giveaway from MyHomeIdeas.com .

"(CNN) -- It is a well known fact that during times of war, women are often subjected to increased sexual violence. Less well known is that the same is true for men. Sexual violence against men is not limited to any particular part of the world. It's not confined to a state's armed forces or to rebel groups. Victims are civilians as well as detained soldiers. Perpetrators are male and female, and the sexual violence comes in different forms. When the words ""sexual violence"" are mentioned, most people instinctively think of rape. While men are indeed raped, they are also subjected to a whole host of other atrocities. In some wars, castration is prevalent; in others, male detainees are stripped of their clothes and forced to remain naked; in still others, beating of the genitals is commonplace. Male victims have also been forced to rape other victims, sometimes even members of their own family. Take the civil war that is currently going on in Syria. There have been numerous reports of sexual violence, including sexual violence against men. Just last month, the U.N. Commission of Inquiry reported that sexual violence was being perpetrated against men and women in detention centers. In an earlier report, the Commission noted instances of rape, electric shocks to the genitals and forced rape of family members. And Syria is just one example. Research has shown that sexual violence has been committed against men in dozens of wars. In the last few years alone, there have been reports of wartime sexual violence against men, for example in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic, as well as in situations of instability, for example in the 2007-2008 post-election violence in Kenya. Only a few studies have been undertaken on the subject, but the results of these are astonishing. One study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found that 32.6% of the adult male combatants surveyed in the Liberian conflict had experienced sexual violence. Another study, this time relating to the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, found that 23.6% of the men surveyed reported experiencing sexual violence, of which 64.5% were exposed to conflict-related sexual violence. Not all conflicts will generate such high numbers, but even lower figures should be worrying. Indeed, there is likely an underreporting of male wartime sexual violence, akin to the underreporting of sexual violence generally. This is due to the shame, fear, guilt and stigma felt by victims. Despite the prevalence of sexual violence against men for many years, the silence on the issue has been deafening. In the last decade or so, there has been some limited progress. Today, there is often acknowledgment that men are subjected to sexual violence during wartime, and there are occasional media reports on the subject. In official reports, however, all too often, the issue is mentioned only in passing or is relegated to a footnote -- and the principal U.N. resolution on the subject focuses on female victims of sexual violence almost to the exclusion of male victims. Relatively few resources exist to assist male victims, with some organizations limiting their programs to female victims alone. And there have been very few prosecutions involving sexual violence of men before international criminal tribunals. The issue of wartime sexual violence generally has long been neglected. Things have started to change in recent years. However, attention has tended to focus on sexual violence against women and girls. That is an incredibly important issue, but it is imperative that other victims are not left behind. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sandesh Sivakumaran.","Male victims of sexual violence during war are less well known than female victims .
Men are subjected to other atrocities as well as rape, says Sandesh Sivakumaran .
Syria's civil war is just one example of where such crimes have been reported .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A suicide attack by the Pakistani Taliban on the compound of an enemy militant commander in northwest Pakistan killed at least 17 people and wounded 22 others Thursday, authorities said. The attack took place at the compound of Mullah Nabi Hanfi, who had been supporting government forces fighting against the Taliban, in Orakzai Agency, one of seven volatile semi-autonomous tribal districts near the Afghan border. Local police official Shaukat Ali Shah said the Taliban attackers had driven an explosive-laden vehicle at the compound early Thursday, causing large-scale damage. It wasn't immediately clear whether Hanfi had been hurt in the attack or how many of his fighters were among those killed. At least one woman and one child were reported to be among the dead, Shaukat said. Security forces sealed off the area after the attack and the wounded were taken to local hospitals as reports of another possible suicide attack were received. Hanfi turned against the Pakistani Taliban after developing differences with its leadership and formed his own group. Since parting ways, both groups have frequently targeted each other. Pakistani Taliban spokesman Shaidulalh Shaid claimed responsibility for the attack, saying anyone who opposes to the group's ideology and fights against it would be on its hit list. The area where the Thursday attack took place, on the border of Orakzai Agency and Hangu District, is off limits for police and other government law enforcement agencies.

"(CNN) -- It's the billionaires' equivalent of lining up all night for the new iPhone. Multinational corporations and the ultra-rich are racing to get their hands on a Gulfstream 650, the newest and most envy-inducing private jet on the market. Order one tomorrow, plunk down $65M and you'll see your plane in 2017. Gulfstream says over 200 have been ordered so far and it's strictly first come, first serve. Industry insiders believe Disney, Nike and Formula 1 boss Bernie Ecclestone are among the current customers. ""There's not any jumping ahead of anyone,"" says Gulfstream's Regional Vice President for International Sales, Roger Sperry, but he admits it isn't for lack of effort. ""They try all the time,"" he says. The appeal of the G650 -- that can carry up to 18 people -- comes down to size, speed and range. With a top speed of Mach 0.925 -- close to the speed of sound -- it is faster than any other civilian aircraft in use. The range of up to 7,000 nautical miles means passengers could fly from London to Buenos Aires without refueling (a headache for the jet-setting, long-range business crowd). The new plane has been a boon for Gulfstream after the financial crisis put a squeeze on the business jet industry. ""Given how difficult the market has been since 2008 to have something the market is fighting to get, instead of fighting to sell, is pretty good,"" says Paul Sheridan from aviation consultancy Ascend. The G650 is positioned to appeal to the growing Chinese market, where customers prefer bigger, more expensive planes. Wang Jianlin, chairman of the Wanda Group and one of China's richest men, told Fortune magazine he wants to add one to his fleet. Earlier this year the company flew one to Shanghai for the Asian Business Aviation Conference, a key event for meeting Chinese customers. Read more: China's airports worst for on-time flights . The G650 is not the only option for those seeking a long-range, large business jet. Both Boeing and Airbus produce private planes with a long range and luxury options, basically modified versions of their commercial planes. One Airbus customer has even bought an A380 super-jumbo for private use. ""We can do features which the Chinese market particularly appreciates, such as a large round table which is the focus of Asian life. We can do Karaoke bars,"" says David Velupillai of Airbus. Analysts say those planes just don't appeal to the status conscious the way the Gulfstream does, with its signature large, oval windows and sleek exterior. ""They just don't look as good. I think that counts for something,"" says Sheridan. Gulfstream have added a number of bells and whistles to the new jets, including lower cabin altitude, which the company say reduces fatigue on long-range flights, and the ability to use your iPhone to control cabin features including window shades, temperature, lighting and displays. But it's not easy being the belle of the ball. One thing it does is stirs up the competition. Canadian aviation company Bombardier is launching the Global 7000 in 2016 and Global 8000 in 2017. Both promise an even longer range than the G650; the Global 8000 will be able to fly from New York to Hong Kong non-stop. The rush to make wealthy business travelers dreams a reality is just beginning.","Private jet manufacturer's G650 model has range of 7,000 nautical miles .

"(CNN) -- It can appear to the naked eye as a blur; a frenzied whirlwind of arms and legs, but for Ancient Greece it epitomized an intoxicating marriage of harmony and balance. A sport with an almost unparalleled heritage, stretching back to the fifth century BC, Melina Robert-Michon is almost evangelical about her desire for the world to rediscover the art and beauty of the discus. For over a decade the 34-year-old has stood alone as France's leading exponent of the discipline that descended from Discobolus, the omnipresent figure in Myron's famous sculpture of a discus thrower from around 450 BC. ""It's a sport that always existed; we all have in mind the Greek statues from Discobolus,"" Robert-Michon told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""But the goal is really to show this sport has changed, is interesting to practice and to watch, and to promote it. ""I think that promotion is a good way of discovering or re-discovering it in its modern aspect."" The complexity of the throwing technique -- the element that hooked Robert-Michon as a teenager -- remains as mysterious as ever, a juxtaposition of intensity, power and calmness. As well as proselytizing about the sport's finer details, Robert-Michon is equally keen to move away from preconceptions of female discus throwers as bulky and butch. ""The image of discus throwing for women has changed over the years,"" said the Frenchwoman, who came fifth at the London Olympics -- her fourth consecutive appearance at the Games. ""We are not anymore bodybuilding shaped women. We now have very feminine bodies, which are not that different from the norm -- I think it's really important. ""There's been a real evolution. It's really women who are throwing nowadays, for me there are no difficulties regarding this aspect."" A latecomer to the sport, she gravitated to the discus from handball -- via the shot put -- at the age of 16 upon the recommendation of her high school sports teacher. Drawn in by the mystery of the throwing technique -- something she conquered in record time -- Robert-Michon came second at the World Junior Championships three years later, before being crowned under-23 European champion the following season. In between those two successes, the Frenchwoman appeared in her first Olympics, in Sydney in 2000, going on to compete in Athens four years later as the Games staged an emotional homecoming to the place of its birth. Success on the international stage has been intermittent, but she is dominant on home soil. Her French record throw of 65.78 meters has endured for over a decade and only once since 2000 has she not been crowned national champion -- in 2010 when she took a break from the sport to have a baby. ""When I started, what I liked the most was the difficulty to throw,"" said Robert-Michon, who was born in Isere in the French Alps. ""I didn't really understand how you could throw this sort of device that fast, with perfect trajectories and a flat discus. ""It's something that really intrigued me and that's what pushed me to do it, so I could control it. It's really the complexity of the technique that appealed to me. Discus throwing is both technical and physical. ""You have to progress physically, while maintaining the technique and when you make a technical change, you cannot lose the physique, so you have to keep the balance. ""You can be stronger, but if you cannot transmit this power into the engine and the technique, the physical strength is useless."" With success and failure often coming down to centimeters, all those elements have to be combined to perfection. ""The qualities of a discus thrower are explosiveness, dynamism and speed, all of that while being very relaxed,"" she added. ""The aim is to go fast while being the longest possible -- it's quite paradoxical -- but that's what make it difficult. Your aim is to have very relaxed arms, to give a lot of time to the discus before it's thrown. ""The goal is to feel the discus well in your hand -- I don't really know how to describe it -- to have a discus that's like matching my hand. I have the feeling that it belongs to my body, to my hands."" Few could deny Robert-Michon her four appearances at the greatest showcase in sport, given the peerless determination she has shown to her craft. The 30 hours a week she spends practicing have often been alone, her coach Serge Debie having to fit training around his other commitments, and conducted in the depths of winter when there is no competition. Such is the precarious existence of a discus thrower, that Robert-Michon continued to work and study before turning professional in 2008, even completing a short stint in the army's communications department in 2004. She still visits schools to talk about her life as an athlete and is desperate to spread the word about her chosen discipline. ""My ambition is really to promote my sport, so that people get to know it and get to like it. You can't like it if you don't know it,"" she said. ""I realize that people who follow my results and get into discus throwing just because they know me, actually start liking it and enjoy watching it or even practicing it. ""Sport has brought me a lot and when I go to schools, my aim is to pass it on and share what it brought to me. I want to tell them that they can do things. ""Athletics is great because it can be done by every body shape or pattern, everyone can choose their own sport and enjoy it. I've learned a lot from sports and discus throwing, and I want to share what I received.""","Melina Robert-Michon has been France's premier discus thrower for the last 12 years .

"(CNN) -- A 69-year-old Massachusetts man was arrested and charged Friday in Boston in connection with the death of Stephen Rakes, a regular at James ""Whitey"" Bulger's trial before he was found dead last month near a walking trail, authorities said. William Camuti was taken into custody in Boston and charged with attempted murder, misleading police and unlawful disposition of human remains, the Middlesex District Attorney's office announced in a press release. His attorney couldn't be immediately reached for comment. The body of the 59-year-old Rakes was found July 17 in a wooded area in Lincoln, Massachusetts, about 30 miles from his home in Quincy. Rakes had been an alleged extortion victim of Bulger's, and had learned shortly before his death that prosecutors no longer planned to call him to testify, according to a friend. Bulger, a reputed Irish mob boss in south Boston, is now standing trial in that city for allegedly participating in 19 murders, racketeering, money laundering and extortion over a two-decade period. Widow yells at Bulger after he won't take the stand . Camuti and Rakes were longtime business associates, and Camuti allegedly poisoned Rakes at a time when Camuti owed money to Rakes. ""We allege this defendant intentionally put poison in the victim's iced coffee and then disposed of his body,"" Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan said in a statement. In a phone call on July 16, Camuti asked Rakes for a meeting to discuss a potential investment property in Wilmington, Massachusetts, authorities said. In fact, the investment deal was fake, authorities said. On the same day, surveillance video showed Rakes leaving the federal courthouse where he regularly attended Bulger's murder trial. Rakes appeared to be wearing the same clothing in which his body was found, authorities said. The two men met that afternoon in a McDonald's in Waltham, and Camuti bought two iced coffees, one of which he allegedly laced with two teaspoons of potassium cyanide and gave to Rakes, who drank it, authorities said. Camuti allegedly drove Rakes around the cities of Waltham, Woburn, Burlington and Lincoln for several hours. Investigators alleged Camuti dumped Rakes' body in the wooded area, where it was found the next day. The medical examiner's office has yet to determine the cause of Rakes' death, authorities said. CNN's Michael Martinez and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","William Camuti, 69, is charged with attempted murder and misleading police .

"(CNN) -- A judge set bond at more than $1 million Wednesday for a man who said, falsely, that he had a bomb at Florida's Jacksonville International Airport. Zeljko Causevic, 39, is charged with one count of making a false report about planting a bomb, and one count of manufacturing, possessing, selling or delivering a ""hoax bomb,"" according to Jacksonville Aviation Authority spokesman Michael Stewart. He was arrested at the airport, which was evacuated late Tuesday as a result of the scare. The suspect appeared in court Wednesday. He wore a green jumpsuit and did not speak as the judge set his bond and next court appearance -- October 23. There was no immediate public statement by an attorney on Causevic's behalf. According to the FBI, authorities had first feared that a larger plot was under way. ""The confluence of these three events in a short time frame suggested perhaps a larger plot was unfolding, and made necessary a significant response to evaluate the situation as a whole,"" the agency said in a statement Wednesday. The first event involved Causevic at a security checkpoint, where he indicated his bag contained a bomb. The second event unfolded when police approached a male suspect, who grew defensive and dropped a bag he was carrying. It was later determined that he had no connection to the initial threat. The man was arrested on unrelated charged, the FBI said in its statement. The third event involved a disruptive passenger on an out-bound flight. No arrests were made in that case, and it was also determined not to have anything to do with the other two incidents, the FBI said. After the airport was evacuated, some arriving flights were diverted and some passengers who were on planes that had already landed were taken to hotels. Hours later, officials issued an all-clear. ""We erred on the side of caution in terms of doing whatever's necessary to make sure that everybody is safe,"" said Stewart.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. distributor of an Australian film about a group of Aboriginal women soul singers has apologized for a DVD cover which critics have labeled sexist and racist. ""The Sapphires,"" a feel-good hit in Australia, told the story of an all-women Aboriginal soul group in the 1960s who overcome racism at home to forge a successful career. But the cover art for the U.S. release of the DVD, distributed by Anchor Bay Entertainment, has drawn a storm of criticism for the way it relegates the film's four Aboriginal women actors to the background, their skin tones rendered a muted blue, and places the white male actor who plays their manager in the foreground. The manager is played by Irish actor Chris O'Dowd, the best known of the film's actors, who has a rising profile in Hollywood on the back of performances in hits including ""Bridesmaids."" On the cover of the Australian release of the DVD, O'Dowd receives equal prominence with his co-stars, Deborah Mailman, Jessica Mauboy, Miranda Tapsell and Shari Sebbens. Anchor Bay Entertainment said in a statement that it ""regrets any unintentional upset"" caused by the DVD, which was released in the U.S. Tuesday. ""New cover art is being considered for future replenishment orders,"" the statement said. The cover art had sparked a social media backlash and drawn nearly 17,000 signatures to an online petition urging Anchor Bay Entertainment to repackage the film. The petition, started by Melbourne woman Lucy Manne, quoted a London-based film blogger MaryAnn Johanson, who had written about the film's marketing: ""Movies about women are rare enough. Movies about black women are even rarer. And now we're gonna pretend the movies about women, whatever their color, aren't even about them at all?"" The original Sapphires -- the singers whose real-life story inspired the film -- also entered the fray, writing to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), a powerful civil rights lobby group in the U.S., to boycott the American release of the DVD, Melbourne's The Age newspaper reported. O'Dowd also weighed in to the debate about the cover art. ""It's ridiculous, it's misleading, it's ill-judged, insensitive and everything the film wasn't,"" he wrote, in a tweet that was later deleted. But others felt the anger over the cover art was misplaced. Karl Quinn, national film editor for Australia's Fairfax Media, wrote that the campaign over the cover art was ""misguided,"" arguing that leveraging O'Dowd's profile was ""unquestionably the best shot the US distributors have of finding an audience for 'The Sapphires'."" The film's producers, Rosemary Blight and Kylie du Fresne, thanked Anchor Bay for its apology, saying in a joint statement that they hoped that the film's marketing materials would reflect its themes. ""It has always been our hope that the film would play a part in building mutual respect and understanding between the Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples of Australia,'' they wrote.","The U.S. DVD cover art for an Australian film about Aboriginal soul singers has been criticized .

"(CNN) -- Chuck Berry was nowhere in the tavern, either in person or on record. But inside my head I was hearing his voice: . ""Drop the coin right into the slot/You've gotta hear something that's really hot. ..."" James Taylor wasn't in the place, either. Not the man, not his music. Yet I was hearing his voice, too: . ""Hey, mister, that's me up on the jukebox/I'm the one that's singing this sad song/Well, I'll cry every time that you slip in one more dime ... "" There was no mystery to what was bringing on this private reverie. I had stopped into an Ohio tavern for a cheeseburger the other night, and when I looked across the room I saw an ultra-slim, touchscreen-enabled, digital-music-only jukebox displaying a backlit message. The message was an invitation to try something called AMI Bar Link. To do that, customers would download an app to their smartphones. This would allow them -- in the words of the official announcement from AMI Entertainment Network -- to ""play music right from your seat. . .there's no more waiting in line to select songs."" Digital jukeboxes have, of course, been around for quite a while. The more recent app-enabled jukeboxes -- there is competition in the field; AMI is not alone -- are based upon a perceived desire: that customers in bars and restaurants are eager to pull out their smartphones, gaze at the little screens, see a full selection of the songs on the jukebox that's across the room, then, in AMI's words, take advantage of ""a greatly improved user interface and a variety of new features, including automatic check-ins, better search capabilities, and a more secure purchasing process."" In other words: play a song. Now ... ingenuity on the part of companies is to be applauded, and it's certainly easy to see how the jukebox industry feels the need to keep modernizing. Every person with a smartphone already has, in essence, a personal jukebox in his or her pocket -- what's the need for real jukeboxes if everyone has an infinite and portable selection of music available at all times? So, on the surface, it makes sense that jukebox manufacturers would try to do all they could do to appeal to the smartphone generation. However, something feels slightly amiss. For starters, is it really such a burden to stand up and walk the few feet to a jukebox? It's a hallowed part of the American experience -- that jukebox stroll, and then standing there thinking about what to play next, has always been kind of a kick. And besides, people can use the exercise. Also: Is there truly a hankering among people to find yet another reason to stare at their phones instead of at their actual surroundings? It's not as if music summoned from phone screens is a rarity, some exotic trick destined to fascinate. People do it all day, every day. Jukeboxes, though ... well, jukeboxes were never meant to be regarded from a distance. They glowed and bubbled, they flashed and blinked, their come-hither wink said: You really want to walk over here. You won't be sorry. What could be simpler: Head over to the jukebox, commune with its list of songs, feed it some money, listen to the music you've chosen. Well, perhaps this is simpler, although it's difficult to imagine. According to AMI, ""Using the app is easy: Just search for a venue with the app's built-in location finder, sign in with a Megatouch Live account, and start playing your favorite songs! If you don't have a Megatouch Live account, you can create one from within the app. ... Once a user selects a song, funds are pulled from the user's App Wallet and sent directly to the machine."" (And, for those who are accustomed to VIP lounges and skyboxes, users of the app can, from many feet away, ditch in line, according to AMI: ""They can even bump their songs to the front of the queue by selecting the Priority Play option for an additional charge."") Lovers of jukeboxes have long known, through word of mouth, where the best ones in every city are. There was an exceptional one in the first-floor bar of a long-gone Holiday Inn in Kansas City, where Aerosmith's ""Dream On,"" when it first came out, sounded almost as good as hearing the band play the song live; a jukebox in a bowling alley called Wally's Seymour Bowl in Seymour, Wisconsin, had an especially crisp-sounding version of Alan Jackson's twang-and-power-chord remake of ""Mercury Blues."" You may have your own nominees; a good jukebox is worth traveling many miles to visit. It's certainly worth getting up from your seat. At Blueberry Hill, a restaurant and bar in St. Louis that has for decades been reputed to have one of the finest jukebox selections in the United States, Chuck Berry himself is still a regular, in-the-flesh presence. In the early Elvis Presley movie ""Loving You,"" a jukebox even plays a key role as Elvis' ally in a fight with a local tough guy. Here: Take a look for yourself. There is, at least symbolically, a throwback aspect to the app plan: Americans who are old enough may remember the little wall-box jukeboxes that were mounted next to booths in some restaurants, for the convenience of customers in mid-meal. So perhaps it will turn out to be a brilliant business decision to adapt jukeboxes to the smartphone era. But there's another school of business thought: When everyone else zigs, that's the time for you to zag. Let people, at their homes, in their cars, at their offices play personal music on their phones to their hearts' content. They're doing it anyway. But when they go out at night, give them something they don't have at home: . An old Wurlitzer, or Seeburg, or Rock-Ola. A classic jukebox stocked with vinyl, with records the customers can actually watch being played behind the glass. On astonishing-looking turntables. With needles. Now, that would be something worth getting out of your seat to see. But, a word of caution, from Olivia Newton-John: . ""Please, mister, please/Don't play B-17 ...""

"(CNN) -- A federal court ruled Thursday that a Montana bride accused of pushing her new husband off a cliff to his death will be released from custody as she awaits her trial. It is not clear at this time how much money Jordan Linn Graham will have to post to be released on bond or what conditions her bond will require. An order imposing conditions of her release will be filed separately. Graham has not yet been released from custody. ""Because the government concedes that Graham does not pose a risk of flight, and has not met its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the safety of the community, the court concludes that Graham must be released,"" reads the order from Judge Jeremiah Lynch. Graham appeared in the U.S. District Court of Montana in Missoula, Montana, on Wednesday for her detention hearing on a charge that she pushed her husband, Cody L. Johnson, off a cliff in July on a hiking trail in Glacier National Park. The case is being heard in federal court because the park is under federal jurisdiction. Graham is facing a second-degree murder charge; if she is convicted, she could be sentenced to life in prison. The couple had been married for a little more than a week when Johnson fell to his death. The affidavit supporting Graham's murder charge states that she told police she decided to travel with Johnson to the hiking trail the evening of July 7 and an argument ensued. ""Graham stated their argument intensified. At one point in time during their arguing, Graham turned and began to walk away. She stated Johnson grabbed her by the arm,"" reads the affidavit. Graham said she then turned around and removed his hand. ""Graham stated she could have just walked away, but due to her anger, she pushed Johnson with both hands in the back and as a result, he fell face first off the cliff,"" reads the affidavit. Johnson's body was found several days later. The affidavit also states that Graham texted a friend the same night her husband died, saying in the message that she was going to talk to Johnson about having ""second thoughts."" Graham texted, ""Oh well, I am about to talk to him."" Her friend responded, ""I'll pray for you guys."" Graham then replied, ""Dead serious, if u don't hear from me at all again tonight, something happened,"" according to a court document filed in the case.

"Boston (CNN) -- They were partners-in-crime for more than two decades: Reputed mob boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger and his henchman, Stephen ""The Rifleman"" Flemmi. In the course of three days on the witness stand in Bulger's federal trial, Flemmi has described in great detail the murders he says he witnessed Bulger commit and he has portrayed himself as a lackey following orders and getting rid of physical evidence -- pulling victims' teeth to avoid identification and disposing of bodies. On Tuesday, Bulger's lawyer, Hank Brennan, tried to reverse the image and portray Flemmi as a man who knew how to kill people independently of Bulger. He focused in on Flemmi's common-law stepdaughter Deborah Hussey. Not only did Flemmi molest her when she was 17 (an act Flemmi maintains happened twice and was consensual), he also lured her to her death at age 26 after first taking her shopping. ""That murder could have been prevented by one word from Bulger,"" Flemmi said. ""All he had to say was p-a-s-s, pass. I would have been happy."" Flemmi testified he watched and did nothing as Bulger strangled the troubled girl with his bare hands. After she was dead Flemmi removed her beige sweater, pulled-out her teeth as he had done with other victims to thwart identification of bodies, and then buried her in a basement floor, he testified. Juror weeps as witness in Bulger trial details strangling death of woman . ""You murdered your stepdaughter,"" Brennan charged. ""In the eyes of the law, yes,"" Flemmi responded, ""but physically no."" Bulger's lawyer then continued to portray Flemmi as a pedophile, whose actions contributed to his stepdaughter's drug addiction. Flemmi became unnerved, pointing at Bulger who sat just eight feet away, snapping, ""You want to talk about pedophilia, right over there at that table."" He then referenced a trip Bulger made to Mexico with a 16-year-old-girlfriend. Lawyers for Bulger, who is charged with 19 murders, extortion and racketeering, also questioned Flemmi about the murder of Flemmi's girlfriend, Debbie Davis. Flemmi said in earlier testimony that Bulger strangled the 26-year-old beauty because she knew the name of a rogue FBI agent who had recruited Bulger and Flemmi to work as informants. ""In Bulger's eyes that was a serious offense,"" Flemmi testified. It's 'Whitey' vs. 'The Rifleman' as Bulger defense goes for top prosecution . Brennan asked about dinner meetings Flemmi had with Connolly at Flemmi's parents' home and wondered why they weren't killed. Flemmi called the question ""ridiculous"" and said, ""All my mother knew was how to cook and she was a very good cook. She didn't know John Connolly from a hole in the wall."" Bulger's lawyer pointed out Davis was murdered after Flemmi learned she was involved with another man. And he tried pointing out inconsistencies in Flemmi's prior testimony about exactly where the woman died in the house she had been lured to, upstairs or after Flemmi and Bulger carried her to the basement. Shot by shot testimony makes jurors squirm . ""I'm not a doctor. She looked dead to me. She felt dead. She was dead,"" said Flemmi, who testified earlier that Bulger strangled Davis upstairs. He also said her death was ""such a distasteful act, it's a guilt trip I've been on all these years."" In an attempt to show Flemmi was his own man, Brennan led Flemmi through a series of murders and crimes he committed before he met Bulger. Flemmi contended as part of a criminal gang, he couldn't back out or say 'No' once the gang had made a decision. ""You don't understand the underworld at all,"" Flemmi hissed at Bulger's lawyer.""You don't know nothing. That's the real world. That's the world I was involved in.""

"New York (CNN) -- A New York Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that Occupy protesters will be allowed to return to Zuccotti Park, but they can't bring their tents and generators -- once a mainstay of the movement. The Lower Manhattan property has been a home for the loosely defined group for nearly two months, spawning similar demonstrations in cities nationwide and around the world. Police in riot gear cleared them out early Tuesday morning, a move that attorneys for the demonstrators say was unlawful. But Justice Michael Stallman ruled in favor of city officials and Brookfield Properties, the park's owner and developer, who have each raised health and sanitation concerns. The order does not prevent Zuccotti park demonstrations, but says protesters' First Amendment rights not do include remaining there ""along with their tents, structures, generators, and other installations to the exclusion of the owner's reasonable rights and duties to maintain"" the area. Stallman said protesters' rights cannot come at the exclusion of those ""who might wish to use the space safely."" Demonstrators cried foul. ""It's hard to expect much else,"" said protester Amos Fisher. ""The rules are slanted in favor of money."" New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, meanwhile, said the ""court's ruling vindicates our position that First Amendment rights do not include the right to endanger the public or infringe on the rights of others by taking over a public space with tents and tarps."" Earlier Tuesday, at least two people were seen jumping over a metal barricade before they were forcibly removed by authorities. Video of the park showed security officers picking up one protester and tossing the individual over the fence. ""The mayor, the police have been itching to do this for weeks,"" said Bill Dobbs, a spokesman for the loosely defined group. ""We're here to raise an outcry about economic conditions and not get into confrontations with police."" Hundreds of police and private security guards filled the park and the surrounding area Tuesday, as demonstrators circled their former home base. ""We have an obligation to enforce the laws today, to make sure that everybody has access to the park so everybody can protest."" Bloomberg said. ""We also have a similar, just as important obligation to protect the health and safety of the people in the park."" The operation to clear the park began around 1 a.m., the mayor said, with police handing out notices from the park's owner that said the continued occupation posed a health and fire hazard. ""You are required to immediately remove all property, including tents, sleeping bags and tarps, from Zuccotti Park,"" the note said. ""That means you must remove the property now."" Police in riot gear then moved into the park, evicting hundreds of protesters. Dozens of protesters who had camped out at the Lower Manhattan park since September 17 linked arms in defiance. Many chanted, ""Whose park? Our park"" and ""You don't have to do this."" Police arrested more than 100 people, according to Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne. New York City Council member Ydanis Rodriguez was among those arrested, after he rushed down to the park when he heard police were evicting protesters, his spokesman, David Segal, told CNN. Medical crews treated three people for minor injuries, Bloomberg said. A police officer was also hospitalized after experiencing heart palpitations, he said. Continuing concerns about public health and safety and the impact of the protests on nearby businesses, as well as the rights of others to use the park, prompted city officials to dismantle the camp, Bloomberg said. While the city has a long history of embracing free expression, circumstances at the park had become ""intolerable,"" he explained. The Occupy Wall Street website video-streamed the eviction under a banner headline that read, ""NYPD is raiding Liberty Square."" Liberty Square is the former name of the park. While many protesters left without resisting, many others moved to the center of the park to an area known as the ""kitchen."" There, they built barricades with tables to keep police away. The air was thick with smoke, which some protesters said was from tear gas that officers lobbed. Others said officers took thousands of books from the camp's makeshift library and tossed them in Dumpsters. ""In an immense show of force, police have shown their presence,"" said Kanene Holder, a spokeswoman for the Occupy Wall Street movement. ""I've seen how agitated the police are and some (are) pushing and shoving to remove us."" CNN could not confirm those accounts, as police kept journalists a block and a half away from the park during the raid. However, CNN was able to obtain footage of piles of clothing, tents and tarps made by police as they cleaned out the park. Later Tuesday, police said that protesters seeking to claim personal property that was removed from the park can do so starting Wednesday, at a specific Sanitation Department garage. By 4:30 a.m. Tuesday, the Lower Manhattan park was clear, with about 40 city crews in orange vests scraping up trash and pressure washing sidewalks. After briefly reopening around 8 a.m., the park closed again as city officials learned of a temporary restraining order issued by State Supreme Court Judge Lucy Billings. The order -- which was later denied during Tuesday's hearing, had allowed protesters to bring back tents and other equipment. Police, however, did not immediately let them in, and a large group of demonstrators -- some of them apparently holding the court documents -- marched back to Zuccotti Park and presented the documents to police. ""We have a court order,"" the group chanted, as it wielded signs and circled the Lower Manhattan park. ""You don't have authority over a judge,"" they yelled at police. Several hundred protesters then marched from Foley Square, where they had gathered after Zuccotti Park was cleared, to City Hall, chanting ""We are unstoppable, another world is possible"" and ""This is what democracy looks like."" Bloomberg said Occupy demonstrators ""must follow the park rules if they wished to continue to use it to protest."" ""Protesters -- and the general public -- are welcome there to exercise their First Amendment rights, and otherwise enjoy the park, but will not be allowed to use tents, sleeping bags or tarps and, going forward, must follow all park rules,"" Bloomberg said. ""The law that created Zuccotti Park required that it be open for the public to enjoy for passive recreation 24 hours a day. Ever since the occupation began, that law has not been complied with, as the park has been taken over by protesters, making it unavailable to anyone else. ... The park was becoming a place where people came not to protest, but rather to break laws, and in some cases, to harm others,"" the mayor said. Many protesters complied with the order to remove property, he said, but police and the city's Sanitation Department ""assisted in removing any remaining tents and sleeping bags."" While most protesters were peaceful, ""an unfortunate minority"" were not, Bloomberg said, prompting reports of businesses being threatened and complaints regarding noise and unsanitary conditions. Many of the hundreds who left quickly reassembled two blocks away, chanting, ""We are back together."" Jeremy Baratta, a 32-year-old Army veteran, called the health concerns that authorities cited a pretext. ""It was fairly clean,"" he said of the park. ""No urine or fecal matter. There weren't things strewn about."" Since the protests began in September, the encampment at the park had taken on an air of permanency, with tents covering the public plaza from one end to the other. Protesters said they were there for the long haul. Last month, Bloomberg had ordered protesters to vacate the park so Brookfield workers could clean it, but Brookfield changed its mind after it said it was ""inundated"" with calls. On Monday, police in Oakland, California, conducted a similar raid when they moved in to the Occupy encampment at Frank Ogawa Plaza near City Hall and tore down tents. Officers made 33 arrests. The Tuesday morning eviction of Zuccotti Park comes ahead of plans by the protesters to ""shut down"" Wall Street on Thursday -- to mark the two-month anniversary of their movement. Baratta, the Army veteran, said that the movement will continue whether or not the park serves as a base. ""You're going to have to deal with us,"" he said. ""We're not going to show up for an hour and then leave. They're going to have to acknowledge us.""

"Wellington, New Zealand (CNN) -- In April this year I read an email newsletter from a youth leadership forum in my hometown of Wellington, New Zealand, that I regularly receive. This one had a small article about a video speech contest called Date With History, organized by a non-profit alliance called TckTckTck, asking for two-minute speeches answering the question ""If you had two minutes to tell leaders what kind of future you want, what would you say?"" I immediately started writing ideas on my hand during school. I really wanted to add my voice to the movement of young people everywhere, who want to work together as global citizens, to make the world a better place. Since hearing that I'd won the contest and will really speak truth to power, I've been thinking long and hard about the future I want. What shall I tell world leaders gathering at the Rio+20 Summit? How can I speak for those who can't? How can young people inspire action, not only hopeful words, from leaders attending the summit? See also: Can Rio +20 solve the world's environmental problems? I envision a future where every person's rights are respected and protected. I envision a future of harmony and balance, of knowledge and freedom, of peace and prosperity, where wealth is defined as an abundance or profusion of happiness. I really believe we can make this change, idealistic as it sounds. First, we need to educate everyone -- and in a transformative way. Every child born should have at least a primary education. But the system we know will only breed more of the same kind of thinking that got us into the pickle we're in now. As I said in my Date With History entry, we can't meet the future with what we did in the past and I believe that education is the key to change. We need to think differently about human capacity. We need to encourage creativity and divergent thinking. I see the education system working to a linear 'production line' mentality where children are batched - year 1, year 2, year 3 -- and then processed through Math, English, Science and so on, until they emerge beautifully standardized. Education seeks to systematically individualize us through measurements like grades and tables. This is dangerous. We know that good things happen in groups, that collaboration is the key to change. Education should embrace this. Education is a transformative process. It takes time. So what can we do now? Involving youth is key to making this change. Just imagine what we can achieve if we put youth thinking together with the experience of the older generations before us. Initiatives like the Elders+Youngers dialogues help increase knowledge for young and older generations, giving youth the impetus to commit to sustainable development in ways our current leadership hasn't even thought of yet. Secondly I've noticed (haven't we all) that we use too many resources to serve our endless consumption needs, we continue to use dirty technologies instead of investing in cleaner ones and we don't respect the planet's limits. How we can mimic nature and learn from Mother Nature? We can no longer continue to ""take-make-waste"" as Severn Suzuki said in 1992, we need to embrace systems that work as a cycle. The concept of biomimicry has had more lab work than any modern technology -- 4.5 billion years of experimentation, to be exact! In nature all processes are cycles, where the waste from one ""phase"" is food for another. Rapid implementation of closed-loop technologies might be one of the fastest ways we can help to slow the path to irreversible temperature rise and to conserve our precious resources. A fellow Date With History finalist, Annie from the UK, put it beautifully in her entry speech: ""We hear the phrase 'Save Our Planet' a lot. The truth is, planet Earth will survive. It's the human race that won't survive. Humans cannot adapt quickly enough to a changing climate."" I say, let's learn from the environment around us, let's be inspired by the wonder and beauty of the world, let's utilize the perfection of knowledge that nature surrounds us with. As a hero of mine, Janine Benyus, once said ""The more our world functions like the natural world, the more likely we are to endure on this home that is ours, but not ours alone."" Leaders must act now. I can't put it any more simply. If our leaders want our support, they must deserve the trust that three billion youth -- half the world's people -- have placed in them. It's time for our leaders to look youth in the eyes and remember just who needs the just, safe, secure and equitable future they talk about. Before my speech at the Earth Summit, I'd love to hear from people everywhere about the future they want. You can tell me here. What do you think Brittany should I say to say to world leaders? Leave a comment below? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Brittany Trilford.","Brittany Trilford, 17, will address world leaders at the Rio + 20 summit next week .

"(CNN) -- The strongest storm on the planet so far this year is rumbling across the Western Pacific near Taiwan and the Philippines, prompting authorities to issue warnings to residents in vulnerable areas. Packing winds as strong as 260 kilometers per hour (162 mph) on Friday, Super Typhoon Usagi is forecast to plow through the Luzon Strait that lies between Taiwan and the Philippines on Saturday. The storm is then expected to weaken to become a severe typhoon as it heads northwest toward the South China coast, where it is predicted to make landfall near the densely populated city of Hong Kong on Sunday. Usagi's current wind strength makes it equivalent in power to a Category 5 hurricane. The overall storm system measures more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) across. ""It's an incredible storm system,"" said Pedram Javaheri, a meteorologist for CNN International. As the typhoon moves across the sea, it is estimated to be generating waves as high as about 15 meters (50 feet). In the storm's path . Its outer bands have already brought rain to the northern Philippines, where authorities have issued storm warnings for more than 15 provinces. The local weather agency, Pagasa, said residents in mountainous and low-lying areas should beware of possible flash floods and landslides. The lightly populated Batanes Islands -- situated right in the middle of the Luzon Strait, and the storm's path -- are the area the most at risk from potentially devastating winds, the agency said. Usagi is expected to come closest to Taiwan on Saturday. The Central Weather Bureau issued a typhoon warning for the island, with heavy rain predicted, particularly in the east. ""If you're on the east coast of Taiwan, you've certainly got to take this storm very seriously,"" Javaheri said. Usagi could dump more than one meter (3 feet) of rain on the area over the coming days, he said. Preparations in China . In China, authorities have issued a disaster relief alert ahead of the storm's expected arrival over the weekend. Usagi is expected to hit coastal areas of the populous southern province of Guangdong. The National Disaster Reduction Commission and the Ministry of Civil Affairs have asked local authorities to prepare for potential emergencies and damage caused by the typhoon, the state-run news agency Xinhua reported Friday. The Hong Kong Observatory warned residents that Usagi posed a threat to the territory. ""Weather will deteriorate significantly with strengthening winds and rough seas"" on Sunday, it said. East Asia is buffeted for several months a year by heavy storms that roll in from the Western Pacific. Usagi has eclipsed Super Typhoon Utor, which hit the Philippines and South China last month, as the strongest storm of the year so far. About 50 people died as result of Utor in China, and 11 people were killed in the Philippines. CNN's Brandon Miller contributed to this report.","Usagi is the most powerful storm in the world so far this year .

"Cairo (CNN) -- The man who held Egypt in an autocratic grip for three decades is apparently soon going free. The man who replaced him in the nation's first democratic election is now the military's prisoner. And while the criminal case against Hosni Mubarak -- accused of involvement in the deaths of protesters calling for his ouster -- remains alive, news that a court has ordered him released pending retrial naturally has some asking whether Egypt's Arab Spring moment was all for naught. It's a good question, says Robin Wright, a Middle East analyst with the Woodrow Wilson Center. But it may also be premature. While she says Mubarak's pending release is a ""extraordinary development"" and a ""potent symbol,"" its impact could be muted by the long list of worries Egyptians are already dealing with on the ground -- violence, curfews, economic woes. ""It may not play as big there as it does here,"" she said. The 85-year-old Mubarak has been held since shortly after he was removed from power in 2011. He was convicted last year on charges of inciting violence against protesters during the popular uprising the led to his ouster and, eventually, the elections that brought Morsy to power. Muslim Brotherhood's spiritual leader is arrested in Egypt . He was sentenced to life in prison but appealed, and a retrial was granted early this year. While he still faces a retrial on that charge, state-run media outlet Al-Ahram reported Wednesday that an Egyptian court ordered the deposed leader freed in a separate corruption case. The court ordered Mubarak's release because he has been held past the maximum time he can be detained before being convicted. Egypt's military issued a decree to place Mubarak under house arrest, state-run Masriya TV reported. He would be required to remain in the country. Egypt's general prosecutor has said he will not appeal to keep Mubarak in custody, state media reported, clearing the way for him to be released. He could be out as soon as Thursday, state-run TV channel Al-Masriya reported, citing a Mubarak lawyer. Unrest in Egypt . Mubarak's impending release comes at a time of turmoil in Egypt, where an interim military government has been in charge since Mubarak's successor, Mohamed Morsy of the Muslim Brotherhood, was ousted as president last month. Over the past week, about 900 people -- security personnel as well as citizens -- have been killed. Deaths occurred when the military used force to clear two pro-Morsy sit-in sites in Cairo on Wednesday last week and violence raged after pro-Morsy supporters staged demonstrations Friday. Mubarak ruled Egypt, the most populous Arab country, for three decades until demonstrators opposing his rule forced his ouster in 2011 as part of the Arab Spring revolutions across Africa and the Middle East. Life during chaos: Egyptians talk about coping . Despite the release, there's no possibility of his return to power, Wright said. ""He's an old man, and ailing,"" she said. Mubarak suffered a heart attack after relinquishing power and argued that he was physically unfit to stand trial. He spent months of his detention in a military hospital but was ordered back to prison in April. 'Deeply divided' Eric Trager, with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told CNN that Mubarak's release would likely prompt mixed reactions among Egyptians. ""For many Egyptians, Mubarak's release will be met with a shrug. Some will cheer it because obviously a regime cannot last for 30 years without some societal support,"" he said. ""Others will certainly take to the streets in response to it."" But, he added, ""the revolutionary youths who will certainly be outraged by this will probably also worry about finding themselves in the streets alongside the Muslim Brotherhood."" Egyptian tourism in crisis . According to Trager, many Egyptians now believe -- thanks to a persistent state media campaign since Morsy was ousted -- that the Muslim Brotherhood was responsible for the deaths of protesters during the 2011 uprising, not the Mubarak regime. As for the timing of the court's ruling, some Egyptians may see a conspiracy behind it in which the old regime seeks to reassert power following Morsy's ouster, Trager said. ""Others, who see this as a normal, understandable process in which a leader who they now associate with a better time in Egypt is now being released, will give a different response,"" he said. ""I expect that Egyptians will be divided on this as they have been deeply divided in every point of the last two-and-a-half years."" Tamarod, the anti-Morsy protest movement which called for the mass rallies that led to his ouster, said it was not surprised by the ruling on Mubarak's release. In a statement on its official website, the group blamed Morsy's administration for failing to do enough to push Mubarak's trial forward. The group called for a retrial of the former president, with new evidence before the court, and for Morsy to be put on trial as well. The military, which has governed Egypt since forcing Morsy out of office, continues to hold him in detention and controls the judiciary. Egypt explained: 6 key questions .

"(CNN) -- In the wake of the Westgate shopping mall horror in Kenya, your local mall wants you to know it is doing everything possible to protect you. That's bunk -- at least if you listen to one very knowledgeable former beat cop. Malls boast of spending millions on security, but that security largely protects merchandise, not people, says Dan Murphy, a retired Bloomington, Minnesota, police officer. Shopping malls can do a better job of protecting shoppers from shooters, and it doesn't take metal detectors, full-body searches, bomb dogs, legions of security officers or a lot of money, he says -- it just takes the will. Questions linger after Kenya mall attack . Murphy helped implement a security plan at Bloomington's Mall of America, one of the nation's largest shopping malls. The framework for the plan grew out of a disaster averted nearly a decade ago. In 2004, Murphy, then a patrol officer on the town's east side, said he was sent to investigate a man who was giving polished stones and coins to children on a school playground. When Murphy located the man a block away, he found the man's van stocked with rifles and ""bags of ammunition."" The man said he had been ""sent to Earth by Osama bin Laden,"" Murphy said. No one was harmed, but that wasn't because of a quick, coordinated response by school and police officials. In fact, the response was a ""calamity of errors,"" Murphy recalls. Angry, Murphy confronted the school principal, faulting her for not responding adequately to the threat. The principal, flummoxed, asked Murphy what she should have done, Murphy said. And that's when it struck Murphy: He had no idea. ""As a policeman, you're used to having all the answers ... and I didn't have an answer,"" Murphy said. Kenya-style mall attack: Can it happen here? Murphy set out on ""a quest."" He started looking for effective ways to respond to dangerous situations, including ""active shooter"" situations. Murphy learned that at the time, Minnesota law required schools to have nine fire drills a year, even though no student had been killed in a school fire for some 40 years. But there was no comparable drill to protect students from deranged gunmen, dangerous non-custodial parents, terrorists, or other modern-day threats. So Murphy became an advocate of ""lock-down"" drills -- drills in which students and teachers barricade themselves from threats, a tactic that could protect them for the eight minutes it takes, on average, for police to respond. Lock-down drills became Murphy's obsession. Building on the work of others, he pushed for all schools to have lock-down drills. In 2006, Minnesota became the first state to require lock-down drills in all schools. The legislature mandated five lock-down drills and five fire drills a year. Then, in 2007 and 2008, a spate of shootings struck American shopping malls. ""And I started to go, 'Wait a minute. What's working in our schools can work in our shopping malls too,"" Murphy said. Man accused of threatening to shoot up Utah mall . With his department's encouragement, Murphy said he approached the Mall of America's management with the idea of lock-down drills. They bit. So now, twice a month -- once in the morning and once in the evening, assuring that both work shifts become acquainted with the drills -- the mall's security department asks patrons to seek shelter in the nearest mall store. An alarm buzzes, and a ""lock-down"" message is delivered electronically to every store. The store gates are lowered, lights are turned off, and shoppers huddle in a safe spot, typically the back room. The drills last only a few minutes. ""The whole goal of a lockdown is to minimize potential victims while maximizing the time in which the police can get there to solve your problem,"" Murphy said. This exercise costs virtually nothing. Any shopping mall, office building, or establishment with a public address system can conduct one. It does not infringe on anyone's constitutional rights. Participation is voluntary; any shopper who does not want to participate can simply walk away. Few do. The Mall of America thinks the program is of such value that it mandates participation in store leases, Murphy said. ""When a new store manager says, do I have to do this, the answer is yes,"" Murphy said. ""It takes time and commitment and the willingness to work through it and see it to fruition,"" he added. ""And you also have to actually practice your plan. It's got to be a living plan, and you practice it often."" Need a plan? Steal Murphy's. ""I encourage plagiarizing,"" he said. (You gotta love a cop who encourages you to steal.) What threat do foreign jihadists pose? Lock-down drills are ""not a silver bullet,"" Murphy acknowledges. ""Sad to say, there is no silver bullet. If the bad buy gets in your space, it's time to attack or flee,"" he said. But, Murphy says, if the Mall of America can do it, with its 500 stores, huge eatery, and indoor amusement park, your shopping mall can do it too. And they will, he says, if they care more about protecting people than merchandise.","Mall security focuses on protecting merchandise .

"(CNN) -- The managerial merry-go-round has stopped for Roberto Mancini -- the Italian has been named as the new boss of Galatasaray. The man who failed to defend Manchester City's Premier League title last season now faces the same task with the Turkish champions. The Istanbul based club have signed a three year deal with Mancini, who is expected to be at the helm for their Champions League group tie against Juventus on Wednesday. Mancini was sacked by Manchester City in May, a year to the day after guiding the club to its first title in nearly half a century. The trophies aside, his time at City is likely to be remembered for several rows with star players, most notably Carlos Tevez and Mario Balotelli. The Italian replaces former Fatih Terim, a defensive legend turned manager for Galatasaray, who failed to agree a new deal with the club.","Roberto Mancini has been named as the new manager of Galatasary .

"London (CNN) -- Princess Diana, murdered? By the British military? Pshaw, say royal analysts in reaction to news over the weekend of a newly revealed allegation that elite British soldiers were in on Diana's 1997 death in a Paris car crash. ""I'm in my 40s now, and as long as I've been alive, every four or five years there's been another documentary, another book about the assassination of John Kennedy,"" royal analyst Mark Saunders told CNN. ""And to some extent, Diana is rapidly becoming the new Kennedy. It's just continuous. It doesn't stop."" Wildly popular in life and death, Diana died on August 31, 1997, after the car she was riding in slammed into a pillar in a Paris overpass. Her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed, and their driver, Henri Paul, also died. Investigators concluded that Paul was drunk and speeding when the accident occurred, and despite at least three inquiries -- including a lengthy London police inquiry that poured cold water on all forms of conspiracy theories in Diana's death -- whispers of collusion and cover-up have persisted. The latest claim, published by Press Association, the Sunday People newspaper and other British media outlets, alleges that members of Britain's elite Special Air Service commando unit were involved in assassinating Diana. The claim appears to have been sent first to military authorities and then to London police by the parents-in-law of a British special forces sniper after his marriage had fallen apart, according to an article on the website of the Sunday People newspaper. It did not offer a source for its reporting, but the paper indicated that the parents were questioning the integrity of the soldier, who had testified in another soldier's court-martial. Sunday People said it had seen a seven-page handwritten letter by the in-laws alleging that the soldier, whom the newspaper did not name, had boasted to his wife that the commando unit was behind the deaths. Neither the Sunday People piece nor an earlier version carried by Press Association offered details of the claimed involvement by soldiers in the deaths. London police said Saturday that its investigators were assessing the ""relevance and credibility"" of the information, but stressed tersely that their review did not amount to a ""re-investigation."" A spokesman for Lord Stevens, the former Scotland Yard chief who led the department's inquiry, said that ""if anything new has come to light it should passed to its rightful place at the Met (Metropolitan Police), who will no doubt look into the matter appropriately."" Palace officials declined to comment to CNN over the weekend, and the UK Ministry of Defence told CNN only that ""this is for Metropolitan Police to investigate."" The Mirror newspaper quoted Dai Davies, a former head of royal protection, as saying he was ""mystified how any new information can possibly allege anything other than this was a tragic accident."" Saunders, author of ""Diana and the Paparazzi"" and other books on the princess, likewise said he doesn't expect anything from the new revelations. ""That was one of the most intensive investigations ever carried out in this country,"" Saunders said of the London police inquiry into Diana's death. ""And no matter how you looked at it, no matter what angle you looked at the conspiracy theories from, you just came up against a brick wall."" ""It's just not feasible that they would have carried out such an act,"" he said of the palace and the military. ""People don't want to believe that someone as loved as Princess Diana can just die in a road accident,"" he said. ""It just isn't enough. They want more."" Katie Nicholl, royal editor for the Mail on Sunday newspaper, told CNN's Kate Bolduan on Monday that it's worth taking a look at the timing of the allegations -- just weeks before the anniversary of Diana's death. They also come about a month before the UK premiere of a new movie, ""Diana,"" about the princess's life. ""It does prove, if nothing else, that 16 years on, Diana is still an irresistible news story,"" Nicholl said. ""She's still selling papers, Kate, 16 years after her death."" Rare photo of teenage Diana sold for $18, 369 . Michael Pearson reported and wrote from Atlanta, and Eric McLaughlin reported from London. CNN's Fionnuala Sweeney and Bharati Naik also contributed to this report.","Experts say they doubt claim published in UK media about soldiers being involved .

"(CNN) -- Gordon Stoker, who as part of the vocal group the Jordanaires sang backup on hits by Elvis Presley, Patsy Cline, George Jones and countless others, died Wednesday at his home in Brentwood, Tennessee. He was 88. His death was confirmed by the group's website. For many years, the Jordanaires were Elvis' go-to backup singers, performing on hits including ""Hound Dog,"" ""Are You Lonesome Tonight"" and ""Crying in the Chapel."" The group also supported Patsy Cline on ""Crazy,"" Jim Reeves on ""Four Walls,"" Kenny Rogers on ""Lucille"" and Jones on ""He Stopped Loving Her Today."" On their own, they generally stuck to gospel, releasing more than a dozen albums over the course of several decades. The group met Presley after a performance with Eddy Arnold in 1955. According to a much-told story, after the show the then-unknown Elvis told the group that, if he ever landed a major-label contract -- he was on Memphis' Sun Records at the time -- he'd have the Jordanaires back him up. After Presley joined RCA in 1956, he was true to his word. The group sang with him on both recordings and in concert for the next 14 years. Stoker wasn't an original member of the group, which formed in Springfield, Missouri, in the 1940s. He was hired as its piano player in 1950 and only became a vocalist later -- staying for more than 60 years, generally as its lead tenor. ""As a longtime member of the vocal quartet the Jordanaires, he helped to influence the sound of gospel, country and pop music with a unique and versatile style while recording with an impressive roster of artists,"" said the Recording Academy in a statement. ""We have lost a gifted and timeless artist who made significant contributions to music and our industry."" A memorial service will be held Saturday, according to the Jordanaires' website.

"(CNN) -- Singer-songwriter Sheryl Crow says she has a brain tumor, something she described to CNN on Tuesday as a ""bump in the road."" ""Please don't worry about my 'brain tumor,' it's a noncancerous growth. I know some folks can have problems with this kind of thing, but I want to assure everyone I'm OK,"" she wrote on her Facebook page. Crow, a breast cancer survivor, spoke to CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta, a practicing neurosurgeon, about the diagnosis. She told him the tumor was discovered months ago. Crow doesn't need surgery but will have periodic scans to monitor the growth, she told Gupta. According to the singer's representative, Crow was diagnosed with meningioma, a common type of brain tumor. Elizabeth Taylor had one; so did Mary Tyler Moore, said Gupta. Between 6,500 and 10,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with a meningioma each year. Approximately 85% of those are non-cancerous, according to Johns Hopkins Hospital. Meningiomas represent about one-third of all primary brain tumors and are most frequently found in middle-aged women, the American Brain Tumor Association's website states. Although they're known as brain tumors, they actually don't grow in the brain. Meninges are the thin layers of tissue that protect the brain and the spinal cord under the skull. Symptoms often include headaches that worsen over time, hearing loss, changes in vision and memory loss. Crow says she went to her doctor after forgetting the lyrics to her hit song ""Soak Up the Sun"" while performing. Depending on their size, some people will have their tumors removed right away. Some, like Crow, take the wait-and-see approach, while others might never need an operation or treatment. ""Really appreciate everyone's love and concern, I feel so blessed to have the support of all my fans, but I'm good -- really!"" wrote Crow.","Sheryl Crow says she has a noncancerous tumor .

"Belo Horizonte, Brazil (CNN) -- At 11 pm, the tired and the injured gathered in Belo Horizonte for one last expression of discontent. More than a thousand sat in Praca Sete de Setembro, a square in the center of the city, chanting against the government and the police. But they weren't the crowd's only enemy. A sign hung from a nearby balcony. It read: ""Anti Copa."" On the pavement the words ""A FIFA Ã© Foda"" had been painted: ""F*** You, FIFA,"" in Portuguese. The roads had been blocked off by the military police, who watched the protesters from afar. A bank of police horses chewed on piles of hay left for them on the road. Daniel Sanabria, a technician in his 20s, stood nearby cradling his arm, an ice pack on top of a bloody bandage. He peeled it off to reveal an ugly red welt on his left hand. ""A bullet,"" he explained. The day was supposed to have been something of a coronation for Belo Horizonte, a relatively quiet and small city -- if a population of 2.5 million people could ever be called small -- surrounded by mountains, an hour's flight north of Rio de Janeiro. Its famous Mineirao football stadium had just hosted its first match of the 2013 Confederations Cup, a 6-1 victory for African champions Nigeria against the tiny Pacific islanders of Tahiti. It was a dry run for next year's World Cup finals which return to Brazil for the first time since 1950, a chance to prove that the country was ready to host the most world's most popular sports tournament. Instead, military and civilian helicopters flew overhead, roads were blocked and military police stationed throughout the city as a series of protests sparked by anger about the cost of living, poor quality education and high transport costs took place at the same time as the match. The initial spark for the protests was a rise in bus fares in Sao Paulo. The anger was such that, even in a country often caricatured for its deification of soccer, the World Cup, its surrogate cousin the Confederations Cup and the game's global governing body FIFA, have all become symbolic of corruption and waste. Protesters believe the tournament has seen the rich line their pockets, while the poor make do with crumbling public services. The World Cup, it seems, has sparked something that has lain dormant for a long time. ""Tonight this is about all of Brazil, we are moving against corruption. We have been suffering for too many years,"" said Tainara Freitas, a teacher who had remained with the protest until the end. ""And this year we rise. We have woken up. We are on the streets like in Turkey and Greece. They have made us wake up about this. The World Cup in Brazil is about too much money. There are too many poor people suffering. The World Cup isn't good for Brazil. It will bring tourists and money but this is not good for poor people."" Earlier in the day 15,000 protesters had marched towards the Mineirao as hundreds of thousands of Brazilians took to the streets across the country in the first coordinated mass protests of this size since the end of Brazil's military dictatorship in the mid 1980s. Police responded with tear gas, firing rubber bullets into the crowd, and beat protesters who burned barricades in return. I watched Tahiti's brave performance on the pitch as the protesters gathered outside, speaking to Brazilian sports writer Igor Resende at half time about the match and the reasons for the anger. A few hours later he was in hospital after apparently being shot in the back with a rubber bullet. ""The police came with a brutal force,"" recalled Resende. ""I didn't see the protesters do anything. The police threw a bomb and it exploded in the middle of the protest. Then police began to shoot."" Resende said he was hit in the back by a rubber bullet as he ran away. ""In that moment I just ran. I thought that if I looked back the police would probably shoot me again. I don't think the police are well prepared. They are badly paid. They have a bad life. They act like this because they are scared."" But Resende said he has doubt that the police response was related to the Confederations Cup. ""I spoke to one of the highest ranked police guys in state yesterday. He told me 3,500 policeman were on the streets because of the game. They are acting to avoid conflict near the stadiums. The police and FIFA don't want the protesters near the stadiums."" For FIFA, who have been critical of Brazil's preparations for the World Cup, the protests are an unwelcome complication for a tournament already long behind schedule. ""People are using the platform of football and the international media presence to make certain demonstrations,"" said FIFA president Sepp Blatter who, alongside the Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff, was booed by the crowd at the opening ceremony on Saturday. Speaking in an interview in Rio on Monday, he said: ""You will see today is the third day of the competition this will calm down. It will be a wonderful competition."" But the protests have not calmed down. The day after Blatter's interview, the biggest demonstrations yet took place. Sanabria and Freitas agreed that the Confederations Cup, which continues for another 12 days, is an opportunity to make their voices heard. I asked them both what messaged they wanted to send FIFA and the football world. ""Please, please, make more pressure on our government, on the Brazilian government to look out for us,"" said Freitas before she made her way back into the protest, Sanabria still clutching his injured hand. ""They are looking out for people outside the country, they aren't looking for us, for the poor people."" The protestors now have the world's attention.","Protesters and police have battled each other in some Brazilian cities .

"(CNN) -- CNN's Piers Morgan calls the on-screen relationship between ""The King's Speech"" actors Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush ""one of the great bromances we've ever seen in the movies."" Firth, with his co-stars Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter, joins Morgan tonight at 9 to talk about their movie, which leads the Oscar race and has dominated the awards shows so far. All three lead performers and the film itself are nominated for Academy Awards, scheduled to be presented February 27 in Hollywood.  When Morgan asked Firth to describe Rush, the actor said, ""I would describe him as my geisha girl."" Geoffrey Rush appeared via satellite from Australia. Firth also called Rush ""one of the most thrilling actors I've ever worked with. And I've seen him be howlingly funny and absolutely heartbreaking. He's got the whole spectrum covered."" ""We have been texting one another at various points to try and keep sane about the madness that's gone on around the film,"" said Rush. ""And we do tend to refer to each other as Abelard and Eloise or Thelma and Louise."" Firth talked about playing King George VI. ""I fell in love with him completely,"" he said. ""I love hidden, glorious and secret heroes. I'm not very interested in people with superpowers."" The film centers on the relationship between George VI (who went by the name ""Bertie"") and his speech therapist, played by Rush, who worked with the king to overcome what Firth called a ""crippling stammer."" The actor called it an ""athletic feat just to get to the end of a sentence"" for the king. ""When he tried to address the nation,"" said Morgan, ""it was almost torturous to listen to."" Firth saw some 1938 footage of King George VI that was taken after he had been seeing a speech therapist. Firth described the footage as ""heartbreaking,"" saying, ""You can see him struggling with the muscles in his face and his neck and that whatever's going on inside -- there's a boxing match going on in his body."" When asked whether he had trouble reverting from the stammer to his normal speech pattern in everyday life, Firth said, ""It's bizarre how contagious the stammer is."" The actor said that even when he talks about it, ""the words are going to get completely backwards.""  ""The King's Speech"" dominated the British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards Sunday, with Firth winning lead-actor honors and co-stars Helena Bonham Carter and Rush claiming supporting-actor wins. The film won a total of seven BAFTAs, including best film, outstanding British film, best original screenplay and original music.  At the January 30 Screen Actors Guild Awards, the film won Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture and Firth nabbed the award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role.  Firth also won the Best Actor Golden Globe in the Drama categoty on January 16. Morgan likened Firth to ""the new David Niven,"" adding, ""You've taken over Hugh Grant's mantle. You're now this debonair, charming British man that every American woman falls in love with."" ""I love the label,"" replied Firth. ""I'd absolutely wear that on a T-shirt."" Morgan also pointed out that in the King George role, Firth had ventured away from playing the ""classy, archetypical charmer."" ""People with problems are far more interesting,"" said Firth. ""If you haven't had any problems, you're bland."" Morgan told Firth that the actor appears ""uncomfortable"" being a sex symbol. ""If I could truly believe it,"" Firth said, ""I would be so comfortable with it. It's not lack of vanity at all."" Firth also argued that ""these things have a shelf life. I mean, I think you've just got to know when you should gracefully hang up one mantle and trade it for another. And ('Pride and Prejudice's') Darcy was 15 years ago."" Morgan also asked Firth the secret to a longstanding Hollywood marriage. Firth's wife is Italian film producer Livia Giuggioli. ""We've made it 15 years together,"" said Firth. ""We are crazy about each other."" Firth said the couple remains ""very committed on a daily basis to how we will deal with our family lives. We have to make sure that we spend enough time together."" Morgan stirred the pot by asking Firth which of his female co-stars he'd like to be stranded on a deserted island with: Renee Zellweger, Meryl Streep, Emma Thompson or Scarlett Johansson. ""Can I have all of them?"" Firth joked, but added a few more actresses to the list: Bonham Carter, Helen McDonald, Gwyneth Paltrow and Reese Witherspoon. Morgan asked Rush, who also served as executive producer of ""The King's Speech"" and spent 12 years trying to get the film made, if he'd practiced his best ""loser face"" in case he does not win the best supporting actor Academy Award on February 27. ""If you do happen to be lucky enough to be sitting in that little televised box,"" said Rush, ""you know, it's probably the best acting you have to do in your entire career."" ""Somebody told me you're supposed to keep your mouth open because your mouth will fall open anyway,"" said Firth, who is nominated for best actor. ""You paste on the smile."" Firth also pointed out that there's also ""the 'of course' face."" ""You have got that camera up your snout at that moment,"" he said. ""So it's not -- in some ways you're not even really thinking much about the award."" But Firth did admit that, ""No one would not want to win that statue, you know? Nobody."" Morgan asked if he dreamed of winning an Academy Award, practicing and preparing his speech. Firth said that at the moment he was focused on ""how to get out of this interview unscathed. That's my dream."" Watch Piers Morgan Live weeknights 9 p.m. ET. For the latest from Piers Morgan click here.","Firth on Rush: ""I would describe him as my geisha girl""

"(CNN) -- Tributes are pouring in from the entertainment world for Claude Nobs, the founder of the Montreux Jazz Festival, who has died aged 76 following a skiing accident. The death was announced on the official website of the jazz festival ""a few days after your accident in Caux-sur-Montreux, in your beloved mountains, overlooking the lake that you were so fond of."" Nobs, who had been in a coma since December 24 after a fall, died in hospital in Lausanne on Thursday, Swiss media reported. He co-founded the jazz festival in the small Swiss town in 1967 with then-president of Atlantic Records Nesuhi Erteguen. The festival was originally staged at the Montreux casino, but in 1971 a fire broke out while Frank Zappa was performing. Deep Purple immortalized the event the following year in their global hit ""Smoke on the Water."" The song referred to Nobs, who saved many people in the blaze, as ""Funky Claude."" Since then the Montreux Jazz Festival has attracted many music legends, including Miles Davis, Ray Charles, David Bowie and Prince. Following news of his death, several stars took to Twitter to pay tribute. American musician Nile Rodgers, co-founder of 1970s funk band Chic, wrote: ""Claude Nobs, CEO Montreux Jazz RIP - Proud to have been with you at your last Festival. Forever, Nile & CHIC."" Fellow funk legend George Clinton added: ""We are #thankfulfor friend Claude Nobs. Rest in Power. He made Montreux Jazz Festival festival amazing. #PFUNK..."" And Brian May, guitarist of rock band Queen, wrote on his Facebook page: ""We mourn the sudden and tragic loss of Claude Nobs, the father of the Montreux Jazz Festival, and a long-standing dear friend. We salute his unparalleled contribution to Blues, Jazz and Rock culture in Europe, and will miss him greatly. ""Our deepest sympathies to his family and those near and dear to Claude."" The official festival website also added its condolences: ""You always had a sparkle in your eyes whenever you dealt with people. For all of us, who were fortunate enough to cross your path, you will always remain the one who questioned certainties. Â« And, why not ? Â» You would repeatedly ask the same question when we tried to explain why a project would not be feasible. Reality was never challenged only your wildest dreams. The Montreux Jazz Festival is the ultimate proof of that! But not the only one! ""Your audacity resonates in each one of us, a strong sense of generosity and sharing. Thank you for taking us where we never thought we could go. And in your typical spirit, you left by surprise as if to remind us once more, that in life as in music, each great performance could be the last one even if the show must go on.

"Boston (CNN) -- Portraying a star government witness as a mass murderer, a serial killer and a liar without remorse, defense lawyers for James ""Whitey"" Bulger tried Wednesday to undermine the testimony of that witness, former mob hitman John Martorano. ""You lied to your friend John Callahan didn't you?"" asked defense lawyer Hank Brennan, referring to a man Martorano shot dead. ""That was a necessity,"" said the confessed killer. ""I told John I wanted to see him. I couldn't tell him I wanted to shoot him."" Martorano wrapped three days of detailing murders he allegedly committed with Boston's most feared former mob boss, Bulger, by confirming to prosecutors that together he and Bulger were involved in 11 murders. Bulger had admitted to others he'd committed on his own, Martorano said. Bulger is charged with 19 murders as well as racketeering and extortion. He was arrested in 2011 after living in hiding for 16 years and landing on the FBI's most wanted list. Martorano: 'Broke my heart' to learn Bulger was informant . At times, Martorano seemed to parse his testimony during cross-examination. Asked about one murder, he said of the victim, ""I stabbed him. I didn't kill him."" After a pause, he added, ""Not until later."" Martorano also testified that even though Bulger was older by a decade, ""He wasn't my boss."" Still, the former hitman acknowledged there were times he would do whatever was needed, no questions asked, because Bulger ""knew the right buttons to press."" Earlier Martorano alluded to Bulger as ""Judas,"" which he described as ""a person like an informant, a rat, a no-good guy. I was brought up that that was the worst thing in the world."" Although Bulger's lawyers tried to highlight inconsistencies in Martorano's testimony, he didn't waiver, declaring he hadn't lied to prosecutors since cutting a deal that guaranteed his testimony in exchange for a 14-year sentence. 2011: The clues that led to Bulger's capture . He said he knew if he lied, ""They'd break the deal,"" and send him back to prison. Martorano was released from prison in 2007 after serving 12 years. Defense attorney Brennan compared Martorano to another hitman, Joseph Barboza, who may have killed as many as 26 people beginning in the 1960s. Brennan told jurors Barboza was also a government informant and that he lied under oath. ""The government protected him,"" said Brennan, referring to Barboza . Not missing a beat, Martorano quipped back, ""Not too good,"" referring to Barboza's ultimate death once he was outed as a ""rat."" Martorano admitted in court Wednesday that he gave false statements during the time his deal with prosecutors was being drawn up, adding that only after deciding to cooperate with the government did he begin telling the ""whole truth"" about the criminal enterprise and his associates. ""After I made an agreement with the government I never lied,"" Martorano said.","Former mob hitman John Martorano wraps up three days of testimony against Bulger .

"(CNN) -- The Supreme Court kicked its new term Monday, holding oral arguments and welcoming back a former colleague. The justices by law and tradition resumed their public sessions on the first Monday in October, after a three-month recess. They heard a pair of separate appeals dealing with age discriminations claims, and the legal fallout from a major investor ""Ponzi"" scheme by Texas financier Allen Stanford. Watching from the special visitor's gallery was Sandra Day O'Connor, who served on the court from 1981-2006. She maintains small chambers in the building and usually attends several oral arguments each term -- as an observer only. The court also issued a massive orders list, disposing of more than 2,100 pending appeals that had been piling up over the summer. Among the cases the justices rejected for review: . Argentina v. NML Capital, Ltd. (12-1494) - Whether Argentina broke a contractual promise to treat all bondholders equally, as it faced repayments from its 2001 default on the national debt. The South American nation and some hedge funds have been battling for years in court over the refusal of some investors to accept two debt restructuring offers. Federal courts had said Argentina could not settle its sovereign debt obligations until it also paid the holdouts. The high court's refusal to intervene now does not preclude a future appeal, as the case moves forward in the lower courts. Big Sky Colony, Inc. v. Montana Department of Labor and Industry (12-1191) - Whether a religious group can claim an exemption to provide workman's compensation insurance to its members. The Hutterite Christian community of farmers holds all possessions in common and have limited contact with the larger society. Al-Marri v. Berkebile (13-105) - A former ""enemy combatant"" held by the United States again asked the court to answer whether a civilian arrested in the United States could be held indefinitely in military custody-- without charges. After his 2001 arrest in Illinois, Qatari native and graduate student Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri was held for years at a Navy brig north of Charleston, South Carolina. He was accused, but never charged, with being an al-Qaeda ""sleeper agent."" His lawyers challenged his continued incarceration. The issue now was whether al-Marri can relitigate his claims as he sits in a federal prison. Jeffries v. U.S. (12-1185) - Challenge over what constitutes a ""threat."" Franklin Delano Jeffries II was involved a decade-long custody dispute with his ex-wife. On the eve of a court hearing, he uploaded a YouTube video where he sang his composition, ""Daughter's Love"" and went off on tirades: ""And when I come to court this better be the last time. I'm not kidding at all, I'm making this video public. 'Cause if I have to kill a judge or a lawyer or a woman I don't care. Take my child and I'll take your life. I'm not kidding, judge, you better listen to me."" He was later convicted of making threats to a public official. In re Warren Hill (12-10469) - Lawyers for a Georgia death row inmate had asked the high court to hears claims of his mental retardation. The original Writ of Habeas Corpus was unusual, bypassing lower court review with a direct appeal to the justices. His supporters claim Hill's IQ is only 70, making him ineligible for lethal injection. His planned executions in February and July were stayed at the last moment. Hill was convicted of the 1986 murder of his girlfriend, who was shot 11 times. He was then given a death sentence four years later, after fatally beating a fellow inmate with a nail-studded board as the victim slept.","Supreme Court resumes its work after a three-month recess .

Growing up in a tough part of the Canadian city of Montreal during the Great Depression, the once undersized Weider's life started to turn when he began lifting a makeshift barbell. Weider entered his first weightlifting contest at age 17, soon earning a name for himself in Canada, according to his website. At age 20, he started his first magazine, Your Physique. It proved to be the first of several successful business ventures, one of them being the Weider Barbell Co. Over the next few decades, Weider went onto become attached especially to the bodybuilding world -- having helped create, in 1946, the International Federation of Bodybuilders and, in 1965, creating the inaugural Mr. Olympia contest. Other competitions followed, such as Ms. Olympia in 1980, Fitness Olympia in 1995 and Figure Olympia in 2003. He also built out his magazine publishing empire with titles that included Shape, Men's Fitness, Flex, Natural Health and Muscle and Fitness. Schwarzenegger was one of the thousands who read Weider's magazines growing up, saying they ""provided me with the inspiration and the blueprint to push myself beyond my limits and imagine a much bigger future."" Later, it was Weider who invited Schwarzenegger to leave Austria for the United States, financed his move and helped to propel his career in bodybuilding, acting and business. ""He freely gave of his time and expertise and became a father figure for me,"" recalled Schwarzenegger, who became a top-grossing movie star and governor of California. ""He advised me on my training, on my business ventures, and once, bizarrely, claimed I was a German Shakespearean actor to get me my first acting role in ""Hercules in New York"", even though I barely spoke English."" Weider remained active ""almost until the end,"" even after being diagnosed 12 years ago with a heart condition, amyloidosis, said his publicist Charlotte Parker. ""That never slowed him down,"" said Parker, who worked with Weider for about 20 years. ""He was amazing."" By helping popularize weight training, supplement and vitamin use, and fitness equipment -- whether in a gym, a school or a home -- Weider helped change the way the world looks at fitness and health, according to Parker. Outside of all that, his friends knew him as a very giving, smart person. ""He was generous, loving, full of life,"" said Parker. ""He was a great man.""

"New York (CNN) -- The idea for getting married was partly Kevin's idea. The 11-year-old also thought it would be neat if daddy and papa tied the knot on the same day the couple met 15-years earlier on a softball field. So Peter Mercurio -- papa -- and Daniel Stewart -- daddy -- started planning. ""I was walking Kevin to school one morning,"" Mercurio said, explaining to his son that he did not know yet who would conduct the ceremony, or where. And he said, 'Don't judges perform ceremonies? Why don't you try to contact the judge who finalized my adoption?' I said that was a great idea."" In Manhattan Family Court last July, with a few friends and family present, the state affirmed what the three guys had known instinctively for a long time: they were a family. Their story comes as the U.S. Supreme Court gets ready to debate on Tuesday and Wednesday the issue of same-sex marriage -- the legalities, the politics, the social implications. It is a personal narrative, though no less important -- than trying to figure out the meaning of the Constitution and the limits of ""equal protection."" Obama views on same-sex marriage reflect societal shifts . A day old and abandoned . ""I found a baby!"" Stewart's voice was frantic, and the echoes from the A/C/E subway station on Eighth Avenue only added to the initial confusion. ""I said I had called 911, but I didn't think they believed me."" ""I told him I didn't believe it either,"" said Mercurio. But he rushed to the scene and to a remote area behind the turnstiles. There, wrapped in a dark sweatshirt, lying quietly, was a brown-skinned, day-old infant. Abandoned. They could have walked away, but they stayed. Authorities soon arrived and took the child, naming him Daniel Ace Doe -- for the man who found him, the subway line, and the sad anonymity. The story made news. A few months later, Stewart was called to testify in family court about. Opinion: Slowly, GOP shifting on same-sex marriage . The judge dropped a bombshell: ""Would you be interested in adopting this baby?"" The answer was an immediate yes. But Stewart privately knew it would not be easy. His partner at first wanted to go slowly, or not at all. ""My first reaction when I heard: 'Are you insane? How could you say yes without consulting me?'"" said Mercurio, laughing at the memory. The couple had been together three years but their careers as an aspiring playwright and social worker took precedence at the time. Becoming parents and strengthening their bond was never discussed. ""I saw this opportunity here, this gift to be parents to this child. And how could we not say yes to that opportunity?"" Stewart said told CNN Justice Correspondent Joe Johns. ""It seemed like it was divine intervention -- it was meant to be."" Mercurio agreed. ""I think a lot of my initial response to Danny -- saying we were not ready to do this -- was all fear-based. And once I got over that, a calm set in. And you know, we went about methodically, preparing our lives for a child."" Line forms days ahead of same-sex argument . Crib and blankets just before Christmas . It was a mad scramble to get ready, parenting classes, crib, diapers, and blankets. Then just days before Christmas, they were told the baby would be transferred to their care. ""Our paternal instincts took over and it became a natural thing of how to take care of him,"" Mercurio said. They took their son home on a snowy day, riding the same C train where they found him. As blessed as they felt, the couple knew there would be challenges. When they first held the boy -- whom they soon renamed Kevin -- at the foster home they found him guarded. ""In fact when we saw him he didn't blink. His eyes were just wide open and his arms were very stiff and tightly crossed across his chest,"" said Mercurio. ""So we got him in this condition and we thought we just need to love this kid immediately,"" added Stewart. ""So we played with him and build up his trust in parents. Build up his trust in adults -- that he could be cared for, nurtured, and loved. So we showered him with love and touch. Didn't take long. He loosened up."" CNN is not identifying Kevin by his last name or his picture, to protect his privacy. But he knows the story of his discovery. Gay couple fights for right to marry in epic high court battle . A quiet family life . Mercurio and Stewart created an illustrated child's storybook, dramatizing the events-- from the subway to meeting his new family. ""One day he asked me: Dad is the story about me?"" said Stewart. ""I was very happy,"" said Kevin. He likes sports, his school, and his friends. The family went back to the dark underground station. They were all a little nervous about how Kevin would react. ""I think that was important for him to see and know that because now he has a connection,"" said Stewart. ""I mean it's not just something abstract. He really has seen, and knows, and understands. And he has taking a lot of pride in that spot. That's his station. That's his place. This is where we became a family."" Stewart and Mercurio are not activists. They live, quiet lives in Manhattan and like all parents, find joy and occasional frustration in raising a soon-to-be teenager. ""You know sometimes in life you have to say yes,"" Mercurio said. ""And we said 'yes' to becoming this baby's parents and it was the best 'yes' decision we have ever made in our lives."" Stewart said the story speaks to a core of humanity.

"Boulder, Colorado (CNN) -- Even though rising floodwaters were wreaking havoc along Colorado's Front Range communities on September 12, Mark Changaris and his roommate, Stephen Smith, felt safe in their upscale home high on a hillside adjacent to Flagstaff Mountain. A mile downhill, downtown Boulder's streets were underwater. ""We thought there might be some minor flooding in the house,"" said Mark. ""We're so high up, we thought there would be nothing to worry about up here."" The drama was just beginning. In the early morning, Smith heard reports that heavy rain was isolating the city of Lyons, where his sister Catherine lives. He decided to evacuate Catherine; her partner, Mandy; their 8-month old daughter, Tobin; and two family dogs. Using Google Earth maps and a familiarity that came from riding mountain bikes in the area, Stephen told Catherine, who was reachable only via e-mail, that if she could hike over a ridge behind her home, they could meet at a rock quarry. Flood death toll rises to seven . ""I zigzagged farm roads and dirt roads and found my way to the quarry, where I waited for them, quite anxiously of course."" Smith said. They eventually found one another, and the four, along with the dogs, crossed overflowing drainage channels and steep terrain to reach Stephen Smith's truck. A soggy, cold but happy Smith drove his extended family back to Boulder. But not all was well. After the rescue, Smith and Changaris worried that their own home was in danger. Changaris had to strip down and dive into neck-deep water to unblock a drain filled with mud and debris. Stephen went outside to assess rising water. ""The drainage is getting higher,"" he said. Within minutes, their backyard filled with floodwater. ""There was a 4-foot wall of water with branches and debris in it,"" said Smith. He ran inside and warned Catherine, Mandy, Changaris and his girlfriend, Kristen Huber, to get out. ""The latch on the door was creaking,"" Smith said. ""Everything was about to give, and I knew we were going to get just hurt badly if we stayed any longer."" ""It happened so quickly and suddenly,"" Changaris said. ""It went from a very calm, warm and welcoming living room to a disaster in an instant. There was roaring and screaming and the sound of an immense amount of moving water and debris."" Both roommates tried to hold back the French doors. ""The force was overwhelming, and in the back of your head, you're thinking of another slide could be coming down -- something that could be larger,"" said Changaris. ""We just decided in that instant, just to get out,"" he said. After the initial rush of water, Stephen and Mark went back to collect a few treasured items. Huber used her phone to shoot video of the flood. ""I felt a little guilty,"" said Smith. ""One minute I'm on the highest of highs, feeling like I helped take care of my family -- the people closest to me -- and brought them to what seemed like a safe, warm place where at least we could be together. And then, moments later, I'm walking around the hillside in the rain, with a towel on a baby, barefoot."" Two other roommates were out of town during the landslide. They all returned to thick mud and ruined furniture. Last Saturday evening, after a grueling day salvaging belongings, an exhausted Changaris sat down to the home's Baldwin grand piano to play ""Mad World,"" the '80s song by the British band Tears For Fears. Roommate Maren Keeley took out her phone and recorded Changaris' poignant rendition. ""It was a beautiful moment in the midst of destruction,"" Keeley said. The video has gone viral. ""It's whimsical, it's beautiful, it's sad, and it touches you in a lot of ways,"" said Changaris. ""I think it explains this whole event. This is nature, and nature is beautiful in a lot of ways. It's also incredibly destructive. It's sad, and people are suffering right now."" He has been playing on and off for about 10 to 15 years and says he's never been classically trained. Changaris, an attorney, is modest in the limelight. He wants everyone to know that people are suffering in Colorado, his home state, and he wants them to volunteer their time or give money to a charity like the Red Cross. ""Our suffering is very small compared to others in the flood"", he said. The music ""put a personal face on the flood in a way that flood coverage doesn't, and I think that's why it's resonated.""","A Colorado man and his roommate feel safe from flooding in their hillside home .

"(CNN) -- BBC science-fiction series ""Doctor Who"" originally premiered in 1963, enticing viewers with its depiction of a time traveler known as the Doctor who explores the universe in a spaceship called the TARDIS. The series has since aired 33 seasons and nearly 800 episodes with 11 actors portraying the Doctor over time. Matt Smith, the 11th Doctor, set off a bit of frenzied speculation last month when he announced he'll be leaving the show. The BBC has said it will debut a new doctor in a Christmas special. As fans eagerly await the new appointment of the good Doctor, the network will celebrate ""Doctor Who's"" 50th anniversary with a biopic film about the show's origins. ""An Adventure in Space and Time"" will premiere later this year (the air date hasn't been announced) and fictionally recounts the creation of series while exploring the team behind its first episode. ""Sherlock"" TV series creator and actor Mark Gatiss wrote the script, and ""Game of Thrones"" actor David Bradley stars as William Hartnell, the actor who played the first Doctor. To boldly go on a nerdy pilgrimage . Gatiss and Bradley appeared at the recent Comic-Con in San Diego to promote the upcoming film and spoke with CNN on the red carpet for a party for ""The World's End,"" which also stars Bradley. The motivation behind the ""Doctor Who"" film, directed by Terry McDonough, is to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the popular series and to depict what Gatiss says is an interesting story. Gatiss says that he's a lifelong ""Doctor Who"" fan and that he first tried to make the film on the 40th anniversary but ran into some difficulty as the series had not yet returned to the air. Fans know and love the story of how the show was created, he said, and he wanted to share it with them. ""It's a remarkable bunch of people, all of them misfits really,"" Gatiss said. ""They cast as the Doctor William Hartnell, who had been typecast before that, and he got this role that totally changed his life. There's all sort of wonderful incidental details that made the show what it is today. It's a very moving story but broadly very celebrational. It's lovely to turn back and see how something you love took its first steps."" Hartnell had appeared in various plays and films before being cast as the first Doctor, the role for which he is largely remembered. The film explores the life of the original ""Doctor Who"" star as much as it does the series. Take a bite-size tour of Comic-Con . In portraying Hartnell, Bradley said he immersed himself in the early episodes. ""I wanted to see as much as I could to play him,"" Bradley said. ""And of course in the film, we recreated a lot of the very first episode. Not only the first episode but the first pilot that was rejected."" Bradley said he was fascinated by watching Hartnell develop the character. ""He realized he was playing it too grumpy and authoritarian and lacking in humor,"" Bradley said. ""I think as it went on he grew to love the part and felt ownership for it."" ""An Adventure in Space and Time"" is meant to be enjoyed by those who don't regularly follow the lengthy TV series or understand its extensive mythology, he said. ""It stands alone,"" Bradley said. ""It's a very complex piece about lots of very interesting people."" Gatiss added, ""That was my intention from the beginning. A lot of the films I admire the most, in terms of biographical films, succeed because you get involved with the person's story, not because you know all the things."" Part of ""Doctor Who's"" premise is that the Doctor can regenerate his body when he nears death. The concept explains the rotating actors who have portrayed him throughout the years. Actress Jenna-Louise Coleman talks 'Doctor Who' During a Comic-Con panel about the film and the show's 50th anniversary, the creators confirmed the casting of the next doctor has not been solidified. ""An Adventure in Space and Time,"" which is likely to premiere this fall on the BBC, will give fans an opportunity to see new content before the new Doctor is revealed in the Christmas special. ""Doctor Who"" has been a seminal TV series, particularly in the UK, and Gatiss says he feels it may be because the character and premise are fundamentally unique. ""It's a great idea, and there aren't many of those around,"" Gatiss says. ""But I think one thing is very important to say -- the Doctor is a television original. He's not based on a literary character. It's a character created by people in television for television, and it's still going strong 50 years later. That's very, very special.""","""Doctor Who"" will get a new Doctor soon .

"(CNN) -- Arsene Wenger could scarcely have asked for a more enjoyable anniversary gift from his players after Arsenal produced a scintillating showing to see off Napoli in the Champions League. Celebrating his 17th year in charge, Wenger watched on as the Gunners turned in one of the English club's finest European performances for some time to defeat the Serie A side 2-0. Mesut Ozil, the German playmaker who arrived on deadline day from Real Madrid, was the man who ran the show. Ozil's sublime opener and an Olivier Giroud strike secured a second straight Champions League win for Arsenal, which now sits three points clear at the top of Group F. ""Considering we were playing against a top side, we played very efficiently winning the ball back and it was a very impressive first 45 minutes,"" captain Mikael Arteta told Sky Sports. ""We have the talent up front to score the goals. But there is also a hunger. Now we know that we need to win the ball back quickly, because when we win it back in the final third we are very dangerous. ""We still have players to come back from injury and they will add their own qualities."" After its opening day defeat by Aston Villa which led to huge criticism of Wenger, Arsenal has been in imperious form. And the Frenchman was delighted with his side's latest showing as it continued its winning streak. ""I felt that we played at a good pace, technically very direct and finished with great goals,"" he told Sky Sports. ""The first half was outstanding. The second half we played more with maturity, less with drive going forward, a bit more cautious, but overall and outstanding game. ""The first half was amazing, absolutely fantastic. Everything was in there. All that you dream to see when you come to watch football. ""We were solid. Flamini and Arteta contributed to that, and overall it was positive because I wanted Flamini to be very good on the counter attack, especially with Ramsey, and that worked very well."" Napoli coach Rafael Benitez had never managed to win at Arsenal during his time at Liverpool or Chelsea and that statistic rarely looked like changing. One sided . Arsenal, which sits top of the Premier League, ran riot during a one sided first half with Ozil dictating proceedings in the middle of the field. Napoli had arrived with plenty of optimism, unbeaten this season after winning five of its opening six Serie A games and having seen off Borussia Dortmund in its last European fixture. But it had little to offer in way of a response against the tidal wave of pressure exerted by a buoyant Arsenal. In the group's other game, Dortmund eased to a 3-0 win over Marseille courtesy of Robert Lewandowski's double and a Marco Reus strike. Arsenal hosts Dortmund in its next game on October 22 -- a tie which Wenger is relishing following his side's perfect start to the group stage. ""You cannot start better, and the next two will be deciders,"" he added. ""That's when we want the game to come back after the international break and have a great game against Dortmund."" Chelsea . In Group E, Schalke moved top with a 1-0 win at Basel thanks to a Julian Draxler strike, while Chelsea cruised to a 4-0 victory at Steaua Bucharest. Two goals from Ramires, an own-goal and a late Frank Lampard effort clinched Chelsea's first win in this year's competition and eased the pressure on manager Jose Mourinho. ""This is what Chelsea needed,"" Juan Mata told Sky Sports. ""The first game against Basel was a painful defeat. "" We showed we wanted to win. We played really well. It was enough to win. It will now give us confidence."" Atletico Madrid has taken charge of Group G following a 2-1 win over Porto in Portugal. Diego Godin and Arda Turan were both on target as the Spanish side, which won Sunday's Madrid derby, came from behind to claim the points following Jackson Martinez's opener. In the group's other game, Russia's Zenit St. Petersburg was held to a goalless draw by Austria Vienna -- a result which leaves both teams with one point from their opening two fixtures. Barcelona . Barcelona equaled Manchester United's record of 39 away wins in the Champions League after overcoming Celtic 1-0. The Scottish champion had chances of its own but was forced to play the final 31 minutes with 10 men following the dismissal of captain Scott Brown. Brown was adjudged to have kicked out at Barca star Neymar and was given his marching orders. Cesc Fabregas ensured Barcelona made the most of its numerical supremacy with 15 minutes of normal time remaining. ""I'm not convinced it's a red card. If there's any contact it's very minimal,"" Celtic boss Neil Lennon told ITV. ""It changed the game. It's hard enough playing against Barcelona with 11 men, never mind 10 men. ""Neymar has a reputation in the game. Sometimes he exaggerates things a little bit."" In the group's other game, Mario Balotelli scored a 94th-minute penalty to rescue a point for AC Milan at Ajax. The Dutch side appeared to have won the contest when Stefano Denswil netted in the 90th minute but Balotelli struck at the death to silence the home crowd after the Italy striker went down in the area following a tussle with substitute Mike Van der Hoorn.","Arsenal cruises to a 2-0 home win over Napoli in Champions League .

"London (CNN) -- Today, Keivan Mohammad Hassan lives a peaceful life with his family as a civil engineer in Sacramento, California. But things could easily be very different. Hassan believes that had he not fled his homeland as a refugee, he would likely number among the Iranian Baha'is facing years behind bars simply for working to provide younger members of their community a tertiary education. ""If myself and my wife were there, we would be imprisoned,"" he said. Hassan, 31, is a member of the Baha'i Faith, Iran's largest religious minority with an estimated 300,000 members. Considered by the ruling clergy to be apostates, Baha'is have been persecuted in Iran since the faith arose there in the mid-19th century. Its members are systematically denied access to higher education in the Islamic republic today, says Amnesty International. Read: For Bah'ai educators, a lesson in power from Iran . ""People apply for university and their applications are turned down, even though they have strong results from secondary school,"" said Elise Auerbach, Iran specialist for Amnesty International USA. ""They can't get credentials, so they're barred from pursuing all sorts of professions. They can't be doctors, lawyers, university professors or scientists."" In response, Baha'is have improvised a decentralized, semi-underground college known as the Baha'i Institute for Higher Education (BIHE). Since 1987, BIHE has run classes in the living rooms and kitchens of Baha'i homes, on the sweat of volunteer Baha'i professors, many of whom lost their jobs in Iranian universities over their religious beliefs. According to David Hoffman, founder of a campaign to support Iran's Baha'is in their quest for higher education, the college has produced about 2,000 graduates, one-in-ten of whom have gone on to postgraduate study abroad at one of 60 universities outside Iran recognizing BIHE coursework. ""It's a creative solution to a real dilemma,"" said Hoffman. ""These are very resilient people."" In May, more than 30 Baha'i homes across Iran were raided as part of a crackdown on BIHE. The institution was subsequently declared illegal, according to human rights groups, and seven professors and administrators were last month sentenced to four and five years each, for being involved in an illegal group intending to commit crimes against national security. Among them was Hassan's academic adviser throughout his five years at BIHE, Mahmoud Badavam. ""It's unbelievable,"" said Hassan. ""These are regular people, they're not anti-government. When the government blocks their education, they just find another way. Now they're arresting them because they found alternatives to the rights they were denied."" The global campaign against Iran's persecution of Baha'is in education is gathering momentum, with the screening of Education Under Fire, a documentary film on the issue at a number of U.S. universities this month. Nobel Peace Prize laureates Archbishop Desmond Tutu and East Timor president Jose Ramos-Horta have signed an open letter calling on Iran to unconditionally drop the charges against the Baha'i educators. ""[I]t is particularly shocking when despots and dictators in the 21st century attempt to subjugate their own populations by attempting to deny education,"" it reads. The letter also calls on academics around the world to register their disapproval with their Iranian peers, and consider recognizing BIHE coursework or offering scholarships. Read: Baha'is accuse Iran of stoking hatred in media . Iran's persecution of Baha'is is not limited to the educational sector, according to human rights groups. Seven Baha'i religious leaders are currently imprisoned for crimes including ""espionage for Israel,"" ""insulting religious sanctities"" and ""propaganda against the system,"" according to Amnesty International. The organization considers the Baha'i leaders to be prisoners of conscience, and says their convictions are politically motivated. It says Baha'is are not permitted to meet, hold religious ceremonies or practice their religion with other believers within Iran. Nor are Baha'is the only group excluded from higher education in Iran. Human rights activists, supporters of women's rights, members of the political opposition and student journalists have also been deliberately denied access to education, according to a recent report by the non-governmental organization International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. Alireza Miryusefi, spokesman for Iran's mission to the United Nations, said that while the Baha'i Faith was not recognized as an official religion in Iran, its adherents had full civil rights. ""Contrary to allegations made by supporters of the cult abroad, they have had equal access to universities and every year tens of them are graduated from Iranian universities,"" he said. Miryusefi said raids on BIHE had been conducted because those involved in the institution had ""systematically controlled activities of cult members, and ... interfered in their private, social and economic lives."" He said the organization also had the goal of ""entrapping"" non-Baha'is, with the ultimate objective of creating ""an extremist cult movement."" He said those arrested in the raids had been given a fair trial, and had exercised their right of appeal. Hoffman, the Education Under Fire campaign's founder, said the fact that BIHE produced ""brilliant students"" seemed to be viewed by the Iranian government as an affront. Former BIHE student Pedram Roushan recently completed a PhD in physics at Princeton University, and is now a post-doctoral researcher at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He left Iran in 2000 after completing a five-year civil engineering course at BIHE. ""By the time I was a teenager, I understood that as a Baha'i I was going to be banned from going to any college or university in the country,"" he said. ""The price of being a Baha'i was very high in those days."" Two years after Roushan began his studies, Hassan enrolled in the same course. His university enrollment applications had been rejected, despite his strong grades in high school. The university applications required him to state his religion, but only gave four options, none of which were the Baha'i Faith. With no declared religion, his applications were considered incomplete. After graduating, Hassan struck further challenges. He was paid a lower salary because he lacked a recognized qualification, and was removed from several projects when clients objected to a Baha'i's involvement. When his wife, who had trained for six years as a pharmacist, encountered similar issues, they decided to leave for Turkey, and were granted asylum in the U.S. in 2006. ""We couldn't put up with it any more,"" he said. Before he left, Hassan had fulfilled the obligation expected of BIHE graduates, repaying the institution by voluntarily teaching a first-year physics class. ""You don't just finish BIHE and go, you stay and help future generations,"" he said. He finds it astonishing that he could be arrested, like so many others in his community, for the ""crime"" of bringing education to young Baha'is.

"Washington (CNN) -- It is the label that sends chills through the Supreme Court: judicial activist, shorthand for members of the bench who put politics and partisanship above respect for Congress, the Constitution, and the power of precedent. The justices are used to such rhetorical slings from lawmakers and political commentators, but not from one of their own. But Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in recent weeks has laid down the accusation on her conservative colleagues, and it threatens to raise tensions as the court begins its new term on Monday. The docket may not be the blockbuster of the past two years-- where healthcare reform, voting rights, and gay marriage grabbed headlines-- but a range of hot-button issues will keep the nine-member bench busy. ""The possibilities for changes in the law are even greater this term, because there is an array of cases where conservatives might overrule or significantly undercut more liberal precedents,"" said Thomas Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog.com, and a leading Washington appellate attorney. Among the petitions the court will address: . • Affirmative action and whether states violate the Constitution when passing laws banning racial preferences in college admissions and job hiring. • Legislative prayer and the responsibility of states to accommodate a variety of faiths to speak in a public forum. • A ""separation of powers"" political fight between the president and Congress over recess appointments. And more cases may soon be added: . • Whether search warrants are needed before police can look at your cellphone data. • Can business exempt themselves from parts of the healthcare reform law on religious freedom grounds? Activist court? The court's eldest justice gave several print interviews over the summer, a rarity for a member of the bench not promoting a book or extracurricular project. Ginsburg told the New York Times this was this ""was one of the most activist courts in history."" She clarified her remarks to USA Today: ""If you take activism to mean readiness to strike down laws passed by Congress, I think the current court will go down in history as one of the most activist courts in that regard."" The 80-year-old justice was particularly concerned about the court's June ruling to gut the key enforcement provision of the Voting Rights Act. Section 5 gave the federal government coverage power over states with a past history of discrimination -- requiring those jurisdictions to get Washington's prior approval before any changes in their voting laws -- including voter ID and early registration. In her powerful dissent, read from the bench, the senior member of the court's unofficial liberal wing called the majority decision ""hubris."" ""After exhaustive evidence-gathering and deliberative process, Congress reauthorized the VRA, including the coverage provision, with overwhelming bipartisan support"" in 2006, she wrote. ""In my judgment, the court errs egregiously by overriding Congress' decision."" The Justice Department has since sued Texas and North Carolina over their voting procedures, using another part of the law that could make it considerably harder for federal officials to prove discriminatory intent. But on a larger stage, Ginsburg's recent comments have reignited a longstanding debate over the role of judges -- and whether Chief Justice John Roberts and his fellow conservatives have a long-term strategy to selectively tilt the court to the right -- in areas like affirmative action, election financing, and business regulation. ""I think that Justice Ginsburg is picking up on something the American people have picked up on as well-- the Supreme Court conservatives might be stepping over their bounds,"" said Elizabeth Wydra, chief counsel at the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center. ""Ginsburg is pointing out that the conservatives are in fact what we might call activists -- going beyond what the law requires to have a more conservative ideological agenda."" 'Sour grapes' But other legal observers have suggested Ginsburg is inappropriately shedding her judicial robes for the politician's microphone. Some conservatives call it a form of ""sour grapes""-- attacking the result only when you lose. ""Her criticism was based on impressionistic claims that don't pan out,"" said Carrie Severino, policy director at the conservative Judicial Crisis Network. ""She was looking to find a way to characterize her disagreement with some of her colleagues, but unfortunately disagreeing with someone doesn't make them an activist."" So how do the eight years of the Roberts Court stack up when it comes to its record of overturning acts of Congress? Figures compiled by CNN -- with help from SCOTUSblog and the Library of Congress -- found 12 cases since 2005 where such laws were completely struck down, or about 1.5 per term. The 19 years under Chief Justice William Rehnquist (1986-05) and the 17 under Warren Burger (1969-86) averaged about two per term. But quantity may not be the accurate measure, since some laws-- and the rulings themselves-- have far greater political and policy impact than others. Progressives point to those high-profiled decisions -- the VRA case three months ago, and the 2010 ""Citizens United"" case loosening a century of federal restrictions on corporate spending by ""independent"" groups like businesses and unions. ""Conservatives have tried to get the courts to strike down laws that were passed by Congress but by which they disagree -- their campaign finance cases, regulations about air pollution control, environmental protection,"" said Wydra. ""And so, we see this sort of de-regulatory agenda that conservatives are now pushing through the courts, when they've failed to win through the political process."" Ginsburg actually sided with the majority in half of the one dozen rulings knocking down federal laws-- including the landmark June opinion favoring homosexual rights. 'No regrets' In the so-called Windsor appeal, the court tossed out a major part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act-- which defined it as only between one man and one woman. Social conservatives expressed their displeasure. ""Justice Ginsburg in fact is one who does that more often than other justices,"" ruling against the will of Congress, said Severino. ""This is the court that upheld Obamacare on fairly specious grounds, and it's in the process of redefining marriage. It's absolutely absurd to say that this court is coming to any conservative results regularly. Maybe it's not as far left as Justice Ginsburg wants, but we're seeing a court where she's getting her way much of the time already."" Friends of Ginsburg privately say she has no regrets with her more outspoken tone. She has long had the reputation as brilliant jurist, with a fierce, exacting intellect. But now, say associates, this diminutive, soft-spoken grandmother is clearly finding her voice in recent years, accepting of her stature as the public face of a more progressive view of the law and constitutional limits. She calls herself the ""heir to that role"" of senior justice in the minority once held by John Paul Stevens. Her candor may also serve another purpose, a blunt message to the left: back off. Her age and recent ill health-- she is a two-time cancer survivor-- have prompted some liberal activists to demand Ginsburg step down from the bench now, to give President Barack Obama a third opportunity to keep the seat in liberal hands for perhaps decades to come. The president has said he has a ""soft spot"" for Ginsburg, but she has made clear that will not affect her decision about when to retire. ""There will come a point when I-- it's not this year... As long as I think I have the candlepower, I will do it. And I figure next year for certain. After that, who knows?"" she told CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffery Toobin in a New Yorker profile this past spring. And a more coy observation, when telling the New York Times, ""There will be a president after this one, and I'm hopeful that that president will be a fine president,"" she said. It is an oft-quoted refrain on the law and society-- French commentator Alexis de Tocqueville's observation that, ""There is hardly a political question in the United States which does not sooner or later turn into a judicial one."" Public divided . After eight often turbulent years, the Roberts court shows little sign of moving dramatically away from where it essentially is now: four more conservative justices, four who are more liberal, and a moderate-conservative in Justice Anthony Kennedy, who often tilts the balance. This court is conservative, but it can be argued, not radically so. But given the increasingly partisan tone overtaking Washington -- and the current government shutdown is only the latest chapter -- even this institution finds it harder to stay immune from eroding public confidence. Americans' opinion about the Supreme Court is split down the middle, with 48% saying in a June CNN/Opinion Research survey they approve of how the court is handling its job and 48% saying they disapprove. Just a year earlier, a majority-- 53% approved. Prior years had the numbers in the 70% range. ""Among the justices themselves, there is still an incredible confidence that each of them is deciding the cases neutrally without politics intruding,"" said Goldstein. ""And the public generally thinks that's true too. But because there have been so many recent high-profile difficult cases, political partisans tend to paint the court-- caricature it-- as a political tool. That's not right but it is undermining political confidence and support for the justices."" But as far as any hard feelings on battles lost, and on words said, do not expect any lingering bitterness inside the court. Ginsburg and her colleagues have already returned to work from their summer recess, met privately as a group this week, and seem prepared for the hectic round of arguments and opinion writing that starts the First Monday in October. ""We could not do the job the Constitution gives to us, if we did not use one of Justice (Antonin) Scalia's favorite expressions: 'Get over it,'"" Ginsburg said to a Philadelphia audience recently. ""Even though we have sharp disagreements on what the Constitution means, we have a trust. We revere the Constitution and the court-- and we want to make sure it was in as good shape when we joined.""","Ruth Bader Ginsburg's comments about 'activism' on bench may raise tensions .

"(CNN) -- Friday, President Barack Obama walked into the White House briefing room and gave the American people his thoughts on the Trayvon Martin case. His comments were striking in their honesty and in their personal nature. He didn't lecture. He wasn't angry. He was reflective. He spoke about his personal experiences, and the shared experiences of so many others. He called for respect for the process and the verdict, but used the remarks as an opportunity to help others understand why so many people were angry. He said that 35 ago, ""Trayvon Martin could have been me."" He started a national conversation. And -- in the most predictable and disappointing fashion -- he became a lightning rod for criticism from his political opponents. Within moments of his speech, cable news and Twitter was full of comments from the right questioning the president's motives and words. He was called divisive. He was accused of fanning the flames of discontent. Some said that by raising this issue, he was not being a president for everyone, just for African-Americans. Those criticisms could not be more sad. Nor could they be more off base. Because while Obama's comments may have been focused on some of the racial divisions we face as a nation, to me his remarks were about so much more. They were about all of the divisions we face. There are far too many stereotypes and bigotries that divide us on a daily basis. Far too many people of different backgrounds who feel targeted, mocked, or looked down upon by others. Obama's comments don't just speak to the young black man who worries he's being followed, or who sees other people look at him with fear. He spoke to the young Sikh-American man who is called a ""terrorist"" on the street or stared at with fear for wearing a turban publicly. He spoke to the young Indian-American man, born and raised in this country, who is mocked and called a racial slur and told ""welcome to America"" by a U.S. senator because his skin color is a little darker. He spoke to the servicewoman who wears our nation's uniform but finds that the greatest threat might come from male colleagues. He spoke to the young woman who walks down the street and feels the need to cover up because of all the eyes ""checking out"" her body. He spoke to the young Hispanic-American who is assumed to be an illegal immigrant just because of his or her last name. And yes, he spoke to the white Americans who feel fear that of being robbed when approached by a young black man. The fact is we do still have divisions in this country based on racism. And sexism. And ageism. And more ""isms"" than any of us care to admit. So when the president says ""Trayvon Martin could have been me,"" of course that's somewhat about race. But not entirely. Those misconceptions about him and the fear Martin felt that night are all too familiar to way too many Americans. Trayvon Martin could have been any of us. Obama has been the recipient of more than his fair share of attacks. But Friday's were -- for me -- some of the most disappointing I've witnessed since he took office. Not everything needs to be a fight. We ought to be able to have nonpoliticized conversations about issues that are this important. Sometimes, rather than throw a punch, it might be more productive to just join the conversation. Friday was one of those days. And unless we have more conversations like the one the president advocates -- and until we realize it's a conversation that we all are a part of -- we'll won't every fully get to a place where we are finally judged purely on ""the content of our character."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mo Elleithee.","Mo Elliethee: Obama offered thoughts on Zimmerman case; shared own experiences .

"(CNN) -- Sweden's Princess Lilian, the Welsh-born model who lived with her lover Prince Bertil for 30 years before they were married, has died at the age of 97, the Swedish Royal Court said in a statement. ""It is with sorrow that I have learnt that H.R.H. (Her Royal Highness) Princess Lilian is dead,"" Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt said in a statement. ""A much loved and appreciated member of the royal family has now passed away,"" he added. Born in 1915 in Swansea, Wales, Lilian May Davies was a Vogue model and married to British actor Ivan Craig when she first met Prince Bertil, the current king's uncle, in 1943. Then engaged in wartime work making radios for the Royal Navy, she reportedly met Prince Bertil at a cocktail party for her 28th birthday. Reports about their first meeting vary, with some saying they met at a nightclub called Nuthouse while others that they met on the London Underground. The two soon became lovers and she divorced her husband in 1945. However, due to Sweden's strict royal succession rules -- which at the time did not permit a contender for the throne to marry a commoner -- King Gustav VI Adolph (the current king's grandfather) would not give his blessing to the union. Prince Bertil's two brothers had already renounced their right to the throne by marrying commoners and the only heir, his older brother Crown Prince Gustaf Adolph, died in a plane crash in 1947. With a strong possibility that Prince Bertil would have to act as Regent to the present King Carl XVI Gustaf, who was less than a year old when his father was killed, the couple did not marry. Instead, they lived together discreetly in a villa in the South of France. By the time King Carl XVI Gustaf took the throne in 1973, times had changed. He himself was married to a commoner and the couple were finally permitted to marry 33 years after they first met, on December 7, 1976 at Drottningholm Palace Chapel. Prince Bertil was popular in Sweden where he was dubbed ""Prince Charming"" by the media for his long romance with Lilian. He died in 1997 aged 84 with Lilian at his bedside. Princess Lilian remained active in public life until her early 90s, attending the Nobel Prize ceremonies adorned in royal jewels. In 2005, at the age of 91, she stopped attending the ceremony, citing her advanced years. In 2010, she withdrew from public life suffering from Alzheimer's disease. The couple never had children. She was the oldest member of the Swedish royal family at the time of her death and, despite the problems that led her to wait more than 30 years to get married, was a fully integrated member of the Swedish Royal family.

"(CNN) -- A man who escaped from an Arkansas jail last week might be headed to a county in the neighboring state of Missouri, a sheriff's deputy said Monday. Derrick Estell and Tamara Upshaw, the woman alleged to have driven a getaway vehicle, may try to go Dallas County -- a place Estell has visited before, according to Garland County Sheriff's Department Deputy Scott Hinojosa. Tips on Estell's whereabouts have run into dead ends and law officers in Dallas County were working to see if he were in that community. July 28 surveillance video from Sunday shows Estell talking on the phone and then sliding through a 12-by-30-inch reception window at the Garland County Detention Center while another prisoner distracts deputies. He then runs out the front of the jail -- with a deputy not too far behind him -- jumps into a waiting car that speeds away. The getaway car was found, abandoned, just a few minutes away but there was no sign of Estell. Estell's mother was arrested Friday for allegedly helping her son. Glenda Estell, 54, was arrested without incident around 10:40 a.m. at her home in Hot Springs, Arkansas, according to the arrest report. She is set to appear in court August 13 on one charge of assisting in or furnishing an implement of escape for an inmate. Upshaw had been staying with Glenda Estell and was with her the day of Derrick's escape, according to the affidavit laying out probable cause for Glenda Estell's arrest. The same document details a July 28 phone call between Glenda and Derrick Estell, while the latter was in the detention center's booking room, just before the escape. At the beginning of the conversation, Glenda Estell says ""it's all good,"" then asks if his shackles are off and questions ""is there two or three in there?"" Previous phone conversations between mother and son that ""all have random mentions of the plan for Derrick to escape custody, just at various intervals between normal conversations,"" the arrest affidavit states. Derrick Estell has a lengthy rap sheet, which includes charges of aggravated robbery, breaking and entering, and burglary among others.","Derrick Estell might be in Dallas County, Missouri, a deputy says .

"(CNN) -- The deputy prime minister of Belize is calling for full prosecution of those responsible for destroying a 2,300-year-old Mayan pyramid to turn it into rock for roads. ""All those found responsible for the destruction of this site should be persecuted to the full extent of the law,"" read a statement from the office of Gaspar Vega, who is also the representative for the Orange Walk area in northern Belize where the Noh Mul pyramid was destroyed last week. Only a small chunk of the pyramid, which stood about 65 feet tall and was the center of a settlement of about 40,000 people in 250 B.C., remains after backhoes and bulldozers began removing the limestone slabs with which it was built last week. The pyramid stood on private land. The limestone is favored for building roads in the area, and the local chapter of the Belize Tourism Industry Association alleged in a statement that local government officials have been complicit in the destruction of ancient sites like Noh Mul. ""Noh Mul had been one of the ancient monuments with the greatest tourism development potential in northern Belize,"" the association said. ""Unfortunately, such progress has been severely hampered due to the ignorance and greed of certain individuals."" ""More sites have been destroyed in Orange Walk by the Ministry of Works and others for road fill material than in any other part of the country,"" the association said it was told by an unnamed senior government official. In his statement, Vega denied any involvement. ""Minister Vega also emphatically repudiates the allegation and or perception that he was involved in any way with the destruction of the Noh Mul,"" the statement read. In a separate statement, Belize's Ministry of Tourism & Culture said it had commissioned a full investigation of the Noh Mul destruction, calling it ""callous, ignorant and unforgivable."" ""Cultural landmarks such as Noh Mul are sacred artifacts of Belizean history and should be protected at all costs. This expressed disdain for our laws and policies is incomprehensible,"" the ministry statement said. Archeologists had similar words for what happened to the pyramid. ""This is one of the worst that I have seen in my entire 25 years of archaeology in Belize,"" John Morris, an archaeologist with the country's Institute of Archaeology, told local channel 7NewsBelize. ""We can't salvage what has happened out here -- it is an incredible display of ignorance."" The institute's director, Jaime Awe, called the destruction ""one of the worse set of blows I have felt philosophically and professionally."" Archaeologists said they would ask police to take action against both the landowner and contractor, according to local media reports. ""It is against the law; it is against the nature act to willfully destroy an ancient monument,"" Awe told News5 in Belize.

"(CNN) -- I've been in Thomas Hurley III's shoes. Hurley is the 12-year-old Connecticut boy whose misspelling of ""Emancipation"" during a Kids Week episode on ""Jeopardy!"" took social media by storm. Fans are sharply divided over whether the show should have accepted his Final Jeopardy answer, even though he would have finished second regardless. But what we forget is that a young man's honest mistake was broadcast to millions of people across the United States and Canada. No matter the age, realizing that your ""blooper"" will be seen by many can be very embarrassing. Twelve years ago, it was me standing below the ""hot lamps"" of a TV studio, appearing on the Regis Philbin version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire."" It took dozens of phone tests over a two-year period to make my dream of being on a TV game show a reality, and it came crashing down in a matter of minutes. Social media howls over 12-year-old's errant 't' on 'Jeopardy!' I was defeated on a $500 question on collar stays -- those tiny strips used to keep a shirt collar flat. I always wore dress shirts with the collar buttoned down, so ""collar stays"" were foreign to me. Not wanting to burn my third and final lifeline, I guessed and came up short. The first few days after that taping were rough. I struggled with sleep, replayed the game over and over in my head, and wondered whether all those years of trying to qualify were worth it. I even apologized to my family and ""Phone a Friend"" lifelines for letting them down. The episode finally aired, and I didn't bother watching it. The show broadcast around the time I headed to work, so I spent that period walking to the subway, knowing that when I got to the office, my co-workers would have watched the show. But then something happened. As I soon as I stepped into the office, my co-workers gave me a round of applause. They told me that they were proud that I got on the show, and that it didn't matter whether I won a million dollars or nothing at all. My boss dropped off one of his collar stays on my desk, with a note that ""you'll always remember."" For the next 30 minutes or so, everyone wanted to ask me about the ""Millionaire experience"": What was Regis Philbin like? How long does it take to record a 60-minute show? etc. It turns out that no one was ashamed at my performance after all. They were just happy that a lifelong dream came true. Bullying not as simple as good vs. evil . When I got home that morning, there were two messages on my answering machine. The first was from a teen who wanted to remind me what collar stays were (I expected at least one prank call of that level). The second was from what sounded like an older woman who wanted to congratulate me for being a ""good sport"" and a ""gracious loser."" She said that it had to be tough for me to relive an embarrassing moment all over, but incidents like those only make you stronger. And she was right. Social media was at its infancy in 2001 -- it was essentially e-mail and Yahoo! message boards for me -- but I heard from others who sympathized with my plight. I was even told of a possible petition to get me back on ""Millionaire"" under the guise that the collar stays questions was ""too hard for $500."" I asked that the petition drive not take place -- maybe the question was hard, but I lost fair and square. I eventually did return to ""Millionaire"" for a special series of shows honoring ""zero dollar winners."" Before the taping, I had to witness my infamous moment over and over again -- my first appearance was looped for editing on the big screen during a contestant run through. I didn't shy away this time. Instead, I laughed and wondered out loud why ""The Weakest Link"" didn't get a hold of us first. Everyone laughed. Thomas Hurley III will bounce back, just like I did, but it will take some time. This young man got to do something that so many Americans would love to do, myself included: be a contestant on ""Jeopardy!"" That's something I would put on my resume or college application, regardless of whether I won or lost. He left the show $2,000 richer than he started, and what 12-year-old wouldn't want to have that much money to play with or save for school? And I know that Thomas' family, friends and social media supporters have to be thrilled that he got a chance to compete on national television. As a father, I think it's important for parents to keep telling a kid like Thomas that, win or lose, you're proud of his performance and excited that he took such a big chance. Don't play the blame game -- saying that Alex Trebek was ""smug"" and that ""spelling rules are silly"" won't solve anything. And most of all, tell him to take on the world with his head held high. Thomas Hurley III may have finished second on that show, but he is a winner just by stepping up to the ""Jeopardy!"" podium and playing the game. It takes a lot of courage to do what he did, and for that I salute him. Have you ever made a big mistake in front of a huge audience?

"(CNN) -- Five years after battling and beating breast cancer, ""Good Morning America"" co-anchor Robin Roberts faces another dangerous health foe. ""I've always been a fighter, and with all of your prayers and support, a winner,"" Roberts said in an online message Monday. Roberts, 51, was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome, also called MDS, on the same day in April that her show beat out NBC's ""Today Show"" in the ratings for the first time in nearly 16 years, she said. ""Talk about your highs and lows!"" ""Then a few weeks ago, during a rather unpleasant procedure to extract bone marrow for testing, I received word that I would interview President Obama the next day,"" Roberts said. ""The combination of landing the biggest interview of my career and having a drill in my back reminds me that God only gives us what we can handle and that it helps to have a good sense of humor when we run smack into the absurdity of life."" MDS is ""a disease of the blood and bone marrow and was once known as preleukemia,"" Roberts said in her message on the ABC News website. The Chart: What is preleukemia or MDS? It can be brought on by chemotherapy and radiation, treatments that Roberts underwent after her breast cancer diagnosis. ""Sometimes the treatment for cancer can cause other serious medical problems,"" She said. ""My doctors tell me I'm going to beat this -- and I know it's true,"" Roberts said. While information found online about MDS can be ""some scary stuff,"" Roberts said her doctors told her it doesn't apply to her. ""They say I'm younger and fitter than most people who confront this disease and will be cured."" Her sister, Sally-Ann Roberts, told New Orleans television station WWL -- where she is an anchor -- that the ABC host ""is not going through this journey alone.""

"(CNN) -- Pat Summerall, the football player turned legendary play-by-play announcer, died Tuesday. He was 82. He was best known as a broadcaster for teaming with former NFL coach John Madden for 22 years. Summerall also worked for years alongside former player Tom Brookshier and became the voice of the NFL in the 1970s and 1980s, calling most of the league's signature games. Summerall called games for CBS, Fox and ESPN and worked more than 10 Super Bowls. As a player, he was a placekicker and played 10 seasons for the Chicago Cardinals and New York Giants from 1952 to 1961. He scored more than 500 points as an NFL player. Summerall died Tuesday of cardiac arrest, said Jeff Carlton, a spokesman for the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. His powerful and eloquent voice was well-known to thousands of football fans, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said. ""For a man who could dramatically capture a moment with very few words,"" Jones said, ""there simply aren't enough words to adequately describe what he meant to sports and broadcasting in this country."" Jones described Summerall as ""royalty in the broadcast booth."" ""He was respected and admired by players, coaches, commissioners and presidents of our country -- and always a gentleman -- someone who had time for the fans in the parking lot after the game,"" he said in a written statement. Fox Sports described Summerall as ""an icon in his profession"" and ""the voice that defined the NFL on television for generations of fans."" ""He and John Madden helped give FOX Sports and the NFL on FOX credibility when it launched almost 20 years ago, and for that we'll be forever grateful,"" the statement said. Madden called Summerall a longtime friend. ""We never had one argument, and that was because of Pat. He was a great broadcaster and a great man. He always had a joke. Pat never complained, and we never had an unhappy moment. He was something very special,"" Madden said. ""Pat Summerall is the voice of football and always will be.""

"(CNN) -- Ever since the Cuban Revolution more than 50 years ago, athletes on the communist island have been able to garner gold medals and glory, but not big paychecks. In a shift, the Cuban government says it will allow its athletes to play professionally abroad, ostensibly to shore up the competitiveness of its national teams. But it cannot be overlooked that lucrative contracts for Cuban athletes abroad would benefit the state through taxation. Whether the new policy, announced through state media on Friday, will open a floodgate of talented Cuban athletes to the United States will have to be seen. Several obstacles stand to limit how much freedom athletes will actually have. The new policy will be implemented in the coming months, the state-run Granma newspaper reported. It follows an earlier opening by the Cuban government to let its boxers compete in the World Series of Boxing, a semipro league. Pugilistic passions stir in Cuba . Limits faced by athletes . Until now, defection has been the common path for Cuban athletes who want to compete abroad. Los Angeles Dodgers' star Yasiel Puig, for instance, defected from Cuba in 2012 and signed a seven-year, $42 million contract. There are others in Cuban sports history who have left millions on the table to remain loyal and compete for their government. The late boxer Teofilo Stevenson, a three-time Olympic gold medal winner, passed up a rich offer to fight Muhammad Ali. But Stevenson did not appear to have any regrets about his decision to turn down a big payday by staying amateur. ""What is $1 million compared to the love of 8 million Cubans?"" he famously declared. Top Cuban athletes can make a few hundred dollars a month on the island. They stand to make much more with the coming changes. Cuban travel reform a home run for baseball star who defected . New policy . The opening of opportunities to make money abroad seems like a recognition of the lucrative market for athletes, but Granma explained it as an affirmation of Karl Marx's slogan: ""From each according to his ability, to each according to his need."" Whatever foreign pro-sports contracts athletes may sign, they will still be required to be in Cuba for the key national team competitions, according to Granma. Cuba has traditionally produced strong boxers and baseball players, and even though this policy will open doors to competing anywhere abroad, the United States stands to be the biggest attraction. There is no guarantee, however, that the Cuban players who take advantage of this policy will see that sought-after American contract. The first problem is the U.S. embargo on Cuba, a policy that isolates Cuba economically and financially. The Cuban government envisions its athletes paying taxes on money earned anywhere abroad, but if that money is made in the United States, sending it to the communist nation would violate a longstanding economic embargo, a U.S. official familiar with its enforcement told CNN. In practice, Cuban athletes are more likely to end up in leagues in countries other than the United States. Baseball is king in Cuba, and Major League Baseball would be a coveted destination for many Cuban athletes. The league is aware of reports about the new Cuban policy, but said in a statement that ""given that we do not have any details of this change in policy, it would be premature for us to speculate what effect it may have."" Major League Baseball ""and its clubs have and will continue to act in accordance with the laws and policies of the United States Government,"" the statement said. Another hurdle for athletes is the migration reform that went into effect in Cuba this year that still requires athletes to seek government approval to travel abroad. With this restriction in place, the government maintains control over which athletes it trusts to seek contracts abroad. Still, initial reaction was positive. ""If that happened, it's good for the people of Cuba,"" Osvaldo Alonso of the Major League Soccer team Sounders FC told The Seattle Times. Alonso defected from Cuba in 2007. ""They can play anywhere and show they have good (athletes),"" Alonso told the Times. ""I'm very happy for them that they're giving them opportunities to play in other countries and to be professionals in other leagues.""

"(CNN) -- Australian tycoon Bob Oatley is turning from wine to water as he announced his intention to build a team to challenge defending America's Cup champions Oracle Team USA. The renowned vintner filed his intention to challenge for the 35th edition of sailing's blue ribbon event Monday. Oatley -- a man who is described as ""as famous for his wine as he is for sailing"" -- lodged his intent with San Francisco Golden Gate Yacht Club. The club is classed as the ""defender and trustee"" of the trophy after its team, owned by American billionaire Larry Ellison, won the 34th America's Cup last Wednesday. Oracle Team USA staged a magnificent comeback from 8-1 down to sail to a 9-8 win over Emirates New Zealand to claim the oldest trophy in sport. The American boat was packed with an international crew and skippered by Australian Jimmy Spithill. Oatley said seeing what the sailors from the southern hemisphere achieved on the waters of San Francisco Bay persuaded him it was the right time to enter an Australian team to challenge Team USA. ""Given Australia's previous success in the America's Cup, the Admiral's Cup and Olympic yachting, and as proud Australians, we think it is time for our nation to be back in our sport's pinnacle event,"" Oatley said. ""The recently completed America's Cup in San Francisco has revolutionized the sport for sailors and fans, and we were excited to see how many Australians played key roles on the teams and in the regatta organization."" Oatley lodged his entry through the Hamilton Island Yacht Club. The entrepreneur owns the island off the east coast of Australia and has taken to the waters with great success, seeing his crews win the Admiral's Cup and consecutive Sydney to Hobart yacht races. Details on the dates and venue for the next edition of the America's Cup are due to be published in the first few months of 2014.","Australian wine mogul Bob Oatley has announced plans to enter a team in the America's Cup .

"(CNN) -- Since George Zimmerman was acquitted in the death of Trayvon Martin, everyone has had an opinion about the verdict. I am not about to second-guess the jury's decision or pass judgment on them. Our judicial system is operating as it was designed. The jurors reached their conclusion based on the evidence placed before them and their interpretation of the law as it was explained. As human beings, we see the world through the lens of our own experiences. Both science and history prove that we all have unconscious biases that impact the decisions we make. There are some who say that the Zimmerman-Martin case had nothing to do with race. There are others who say that the case was all about race. One idea that has come up: ""What if we reverse the races so that Martin was white and Zimmerman was black?"" That exercise, while potent, doesn't prove or disprove the relevance race played in the case. A more powerful approach is to totally remove race as a factor by creating a scenario in which both the perpetrator and the victim are of the same race and then see whether people change their views. For example: ""What if Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman were both white? Or both black?"" If Zimmerman and Martin were both white, ask yourself: . • Would it have taken 44 days and a national protest to merely justify the arrest of a known killer? A killer who shot an unarmed child, initially stalked that child, was charged with two previous felonies -- ""battery of law enforcement officer"" and ""resisting officer with violence"" -- was accused of domestic violence (both charges were reduced, though some would say that's the benefit of Zimmerman having a father who is a retired judge) and disobeyed the authorities when told not to follow the person he eventually killed. • Would authorities have not drug tested the killer but instead drug tested the victim? • Would hordes of people have donated money to help the killer hire a strong defense team that eventually got him acquitted? • Would society have given so much credibility to the killer's version of the events? Many have tried to deflect the discomfort of this scenario by focusing on black-on-black crime. While such crime is a very serious issue that must be addressed by our society and especially the black community, turning to black-on-black crime is a form of avoidance. The uncomfortable truth is that very likely, most people would see the case differently if the killer and victim were both white. When will we reach a day when we don't have to refer to crimes in racial terms? In light of how much we know about ourselves on a scientific level, it is a shame that people are still so divided by race. In 2003, the mapping of the human genome code proved that there are no significant genetic differences between what we call ""races."" Every human being on the planet is 99.9% genetically identical to every other human being. But as societies, we live in constructs. For those who fear the average random black male wearing a hoodie, I can empathize with you. But statistically, you should be more afraid of the person you see every day in the mirror. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, suicide is one of the top causes of death for white Americans (PDF). Homicide is not. So, your chance of killing yourself is greater than your chance of being killed by anyone, of any race. Let's turn back to the question: ""If the victim and the killer were both white, would society have given so much credibility to the killer's version of events?"" I doubt that a jury so heavily made up of white mothers would have related to or felt empathy toward a man who had stalked and killed an unarmed child who could have very easily been one of their own. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Al Vivian.","Al Vivian asks, what if Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman were both white?

"(CNN) -- The port-city of Kochi, on India's west coast, isn't known for its arts scene. Nestled amid Kerala's famously stunning backwaters (travel writers have long loved touting the streams that snake through the rural countryside as the quintessential bucket-list endeavor), the city is more readily defined by its breathtaking backdrop. From today and for the next three months, that will change, as the world's culture vultures descend into Kochi to attend one of India's first international arts festivals: the Kochi-Muziris Biennale. Even since Venice introduced the world to the biennale in 1895, the word has been symbolic of a city's cultural ascendency. Often, biennales demonstrate a region's savvy through showcasing the direction the contemporary arts scene will go in coming seasons. Kochi has something a little different planned. Rather than focusing on the future, this biennale's theme centres very much on Kochi's history. In particular, it will put a spotlight on Muziris, India's answer to Atlantis. Muziris was a prosperous trading hub that from the first century B.C. that supplied the world with everything from spices to precious stones. The city drew traders from as far as Rome, Greece and China. It was active up until the 14th century, when it mysteriously disappeared under the sea -- perhaps by a flood or tsunami. Excavations just outside Kochi a few years ago unearthed pottery, coins and various other artefacts that link the region to the Roman era, and suggest that, at last, Muziris has been found. The biennale founders have adopted the fallen port as a theme for the event, and in previous months, a legion of local and international artists have picked over the city for inspiration for their projects. Many pieces will involve found art. Alex Mathew, a Kerala-born sculptor, is designing a piece with abandoned anchors, while Vivan Sundaram, India's leading installation artist, is creating a 400 square-foot reconstruction of Muziris using terracotta shards unearthed at the excavation site. He will both physically throw water on the installation, and incorporate video of flowing water, to represent the destruction of the city. ""It's about a certain fragility of this quiet, thriving port town, of which little is actually known,"" he says. The hope is that they'll draw attention not only to Kerala's artistic heritage, but to its historic one as well. In many ways, Kochi makes a lot of sense as the destination for the country's first biennale. Kerala seems to have birthed a large proportion of artists over the years, including K.C.S. Panicker, considered by many the father of Indian abstract painting, and Raja Ravi Varma, one of the first Indian artists to gain notoriety outside the subcontinent. ""Just why Kerala produces so many artists seems to be a very popular question,"" notes Dorrie Younger, co-founder of the Kashi Art CafÃ©, the city's first gallery. ""It's most likely due to a combination of a high standard of living, the political climate, tolerance for opposing ideology, and a long history of foreign visitors."" Riyas Komu, one of the organisers for the festival, also gives credit to Kerala's political climate. ""There's a long tradition of activism here, and there's always been a very vocal dialogue between political parties. For artists, the most important thing is that they have the capacity to be argumentative."" One of the participants, Ubik, is a Kerala-born artist who has since relocated to Dubai. On a recent research trip to the area, he discovered the extent that politics has shaped his paintings. ""Growing up, I'd always see communist propaganda messages all over the walls. It's an aspect that's seeped into my work, and strangely enough, it only now kind of makes sense to me. I do a lot of text-based paintings, and I was always quite curious about where that came from. Now I know."" See also: Evolution of the Asian art market . Like many artists that hail from the region, Ubik hasn't stayed put. He notes that one reason Kerala's artists seem to flock to other countries is a lack of museums and galleries. ""Most of the art market is focused on [Mumbai] and Delhi. That's just where it is, commercially speaking. From what I know, I don't think Kerala really has the infrastructure for that,"" he notes. Lacking traditional arts spaces, the organisers have done something quite unique; they've commissioned heritage houses throughout the area to host the work, including an old Dutch dockyard, a former 17th century military bungalow used by the Dutch East India Company and a 19th century British gentleman's club. Komu is also hoping that the biennale will bring the necessary infrastructure for a budding Keralan arts scene. ""We're building an architecture where a biennale can grow,"" he explains. ""Traditionally, India has failed to take on projects like this. Hopefully, the Kochi-Muziris Biennale will change people's minds, and they'll start to have philanthropic ideas, and to invest in arts and culture for the next generation.""","The Indian city of Kochi will host India's first ever international arts festival .

"(CNN) -- A relatively obscure drug used to treat mouth sores has made obese mice thin -- and the mice didn't have to eat less or exercise more, according to a study at the University of Michigan. Doctors at the university will begin studies in human beings later this year. Hopes are high, even though many drugs that work in mice do not work in humans. ""It is a tour de force and offers a new and potentially exciting opening for developments of new anti-obesity drugs -- something which is badly needed,"" says Dr. George Bray, chief of the Division of Clinical Obesity and Metabolism at Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University. In the study at the University of Michigan, researchers gave mice a high-fat diet, and they became obese. They then injected the animals with a drug called amlexanox, which has been on the market for more than 15 years to treat canker sores. The mice lost weight, even though they kept eating the same number of calories. When they were taken off the drug, the mice gained all the weight back. If amlexanox works in humans -- and that's a big if -- Bray said it could become like the story of Viagra, which was originally developed to treat one condition, chest pain, but serendipitously was later found to treat a different condition, erectile dysfunction. ""It could well be that what works for one disease will turn out to work for another, even though that wasn't the original intent,"" he said. The researchers screened several drugs and found that amlexanox, used in an ointment to treat canker sores, changed the action of genes that control metabolism. When injected in mice, the drug worked by increasing metabolism, not by suppressing appetite. ""One of the reasons that diets are so ineffective in producing weight loss for some people is that their bodies adjust to the reduced calories by also reducing their metabolism, so that they are 'defending' their body weight,"" says Dr. Alan Saltiel, the lead researcher at the University of Michigan. ""Amlexanox seems to tweak the metabolic response to excessive calorie storage in mice."" The findings were published Sunday in the journal Nature Medicine. Clinical trials are expected to begin later this year to test the drug's effectiveness in humans. In the mouse study, the researchers took pains to make sure that it was the drug, and not something else, that was making the mice lose weight. They used a laser machine to trace the mice to see if perhaps the weight loss was because they moved around more while on the drug. ""They don't move more. The movement is exactly the same. The increased energy expenditure was due to something called thermogenesis, meaning they generate a little bit of heat,"" Saltiel said. If the drug helps humans lose weight, researchers would have to make sure it's safe. ""One concern will be whether these drugs, by increasing energy expenditure and body temperature, may have unintended consequences on other systems, such as the heart."" Experts say that's an especially important concern because if the drug is ever used in humans for weight loss, patients would likely need to stay on the drug indefinitely, or else see the weight return.","Study: Obese mice given a canker sore drug lost weight without cutting calories, moving more .

"(CNN) -- At least 12 people died in northern Nigeria when attackers raided two churches during Christmas Eve services, police said. One assault occurred at the Church of Christ in Nations in Postikum, in Yobe province. Gunmen attacked worshipers during prayer, killing six people, including the pastor, and setting the building on fire . Worshipers also were attacked at the First Baptist Church in Maiduguri, in Borno state. A deacon and five church members were killed. They were the latest strikes against Christians in the region. More than 30 people died in a wave of Christmas Day attacks in the north last year, blamed on Boko Haram, a militant group that has targeted Christians and Muslims it considered insufficiently Islamist. Pope Benedict XVI referred to the northern Nigerian violence in his traditional Christmas message from Vatican City on Tuesday. ""Savage acts of terrorism"" in the region, he said, ""continue to reap victims, particularly among Christians."" In October, a report from Human Rights Watch also addressed violence in northern Nigeria, particularly from Boko Haram. ""Suspected members of the group have bombed or opened fire on worshipers in at least 18 churches across eight northern and central states since 2010. In Maiduguri, the group also forced Christian men to convert to Islam on penalty of death,"" it said. It is not immediately known whether the group was behind the latest attacks. The Christmas attacks came as families whose kin died in last year's killings delivered graveside prayers for a peaceful holiday period. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan issued a statement promising better days next year, including better security. ""Sometimes, challenges make people doubt the sincerity of government, but I am confident that God knows everything,"" he said Sunday. But residents told CNN that despite assurances of security, they have been attacked again. Journalist Hassan John contributed to this report.","NEW: Pope Benedict XVI addresses violence in the region .

"(CNN) -- Sir Robert Edwards, a ""co-pioneer"" of the in vitro fertilization technique and Nobel Prize winner, died Wednesday in his sleep after a long illness, the University of Cambridge said. He was 87. Edwards, a professor at the university and fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge, and Dr. Patrick Steptoe developed the fertility treatment, which involves fertilizing an egg outside the womb and implanting the newly created embryo inside a woman's uterus. Their work resulted in the birth of Louise Brown on July 25, 1978 -- the world's first ""test-tube baby."" Since then, an estimated 5 million babies have been born worldwide thanks to IVF, according to the International Committee for Monitoring Assisted Reproductive Technologies, an international nonprofit organization. When Brown married in 2004, Edwards attended the wedding. Steptoe died in 1988. Edwards was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2010 for his work in developing the technique. The next year, he was knighted ""for services to human reproductive biology,"" the university said in a statement. Both Edwards and Steptoe faced intense publicity and criticism from those opposed to the method, including the Vatican, after Brown's birth, according to the statement. Could 'personhood' bills outlaw IVF? ""Bob Edwards is one of our greatest scientists,"" said Mike Macnamee, chief executive of Bourn Hall, the IVF clinic Edwards and Steptoe co-founded, in the statement.

"(CNN) -- Former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez, jailed on a murder charge, declared his innocence as he responded to a fan letter, saying that ""all the people who turned on me will feel like crap,"" according to a report. TMZ, which on Thursday published the letter online, said it has independently verified its authenticity with authorities. Massachusetts authorities have accused the fallen NFL star of orchestrating the June 17 shooting death of Odin Lloyd, the 27-year-old boyfriend of Hernandez's fiancÃ©e's sister. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to murder and is being held without bail. In the letter, Hernandez responded to the fan, ""The world just makes things out of false accusations and it will all die down especially when they say NOT GUILTY......"" At the end of the letter, Hernandez pleads for the letter not to be leaked to social media. The fan, who does not want to be named, sold the letter to Sportsworld in Saugus, Massachusetts, according to Phil Castinetti, owner of the memorabilia shop. Sportsworld then sold the letter to TMZ for $18,000, according to the shop's Brendan Brennan, who declined to say how much the business paid the fan for the letter. So much for keeping it off social media. But the fan said he sold the letter for good reason. ""I wanted to show him that I'm supporting him,"" the fan told CNN on Friday. ""I don't think it's right because people haven't heard his side of the story. All you see is Twitter and Facebook saying bad things. People need to see that he took his time to write somebody a letter back,"" he said. Although he is supporting Hernandez, the fan still sympathizes for the family of the victim. The fan wrote the letter two weeks ago, but said he didn't expect to hear back. The fan mentioned in the letter his own troubles with the law and how he was able to turn his life around. He added to the letter photos of Hernandez, his fiancÃ©e and their daughter, which Hernandez now has on his wall in the cell, as ""something to look at beside those four walls,"" according to the fan. CNN cannot independently confirm this account. ""I know there is a reason I'm going thru this and I will figure it out through my relationship with the Lord,"" continued Hernandez in the letter, according to TMZ. Bristol County Sheriff Tom Hodgson told CNN that the envelope and stationery came from Bristol County House of Corrections, but could not confirm whether Hernandez actually wrote it. However, the name ""Aaron Hernandez,"" the identification number, unit and room number were listed on the outgoing envelope. A spokesperson for a law firm representing Hernandez declined to comment.

"(CNN) -- Reports of a lone child having survived Tuesday's crash of a Yemenia Airways flight in the Indian Ocean have people wondering: How does anyone survive a plane crash? Part of a United Airlines DC-10 lies next to the runway in Sioux City, Iowa, after the plane crashed in July 1989. ""I just don't think there's any pattern to survivability. It's just luck of the draw and depends on how the plane goes in,"" said aviation expert John Eakin, head of Air Data Research in Helotes, Texas. Not counting Tuesday's disaster, there have been 12 airliner crashes since 1970 that yielded a sole survivor, according to data compiled by Dr. Todd Curtis, director of the Airsafe.com Foundation. Five of those survivors were minors and four were crew members, accounting for 75 percent of the total. ""I can't figure out for the life of me why crew members and children tend to be disproportionate in these sole-survivor events,"" Curtis said.  Watch what happened to the Yemenia flight » . One factor favoring flight crew members is their location in the sturdy cockpit and proximity to windows, he said. Flight attendants often use shoulder harnesses when they are seated, aviation writer David Noland added. Where one is seated is a factor only in that it helps to be far from the point of impact, Eakin said. ""I don't think there's any particular type of aircraft or position in an aircraft which is more survivable, because it pretty much depends on what type of accident -- it depends on how the aircraft impacts,"" Eakin said. ""Sometimes, the survivors are all located in the tail, sometimes in the forward fuselage. I don't think there's any rhyme or reason to it."" A 2007 Popular Mechanics magazine article, researched and written by Noland, presented a different view. Noland analyzed 20 U.S. airline crashes in which at least one person lived and one person died. The statistics indicate that seats farther back in a plane are safer in crashes, the article said. ""Passengers near the tail of a plane are about 40 percent more likely to survive a crash than those in the first few rows up front,"" Noland wrote. Passengers in seats behind the wings had a 69 percent survival rate in crashes that included at least one fatality, Noland wrote. Those with seats in coach areas over and forward of the wings survived 56 percent of the time, and passengers in first class and business class had a 49 percent survival rate, he found. ""To me, it's fairly obvious: You hit something going fast and obviously, the front is going to get crunched more than the back,"" Noland told CNN. ""To quote one [National Transportation Safety Board] guy, 'Planes don't back into mountains.'"" Even in other types of crashes -- runway overruns, forced landings, etc. -- the plane is always going forward, so the front takes the impact, Noland said. ""That's why they put the crash recorders in the tail,"" he said. Wide-bodied aircraft -- such as the Boeing 747 and 777 and the Airbus A310 and A330 -- tend to yield more survivors than smaller ones, Curtis said. He chalked up that trend to what he called the SUV theory: Larger crush zones provide more and larger areas of survivability. Both Curtis and Eakin pointed to the July 1989 crash of United Airlines Flight 232 in Sioux City, Iowa. Spectacular video footage showed the McDonnell-Douglas DC-10 cartwheeling down an airport runway as pilot Al Haynes and first officer William Records tried to land the airliner without hydraulic controls. Of the 296 people aboard the plane, 111 were killed but 185 survived. ""Anyone looking at that crash at first, the video, would say, 'Well gee, how could anybody survive this?'"" Curtis said. ""That was kind of a classic. A bunch of people survived that,"" Eakin said. ""It looked terrible, and still so many people walked away from that. And there was no real pattern to where the survivors were located."" Availability of an escape route may be the biggest determining factor, Eakin said. ""If the impact is survivable, that's the next challenge: getting the heck out of the thing,"" he said. ""I think in Sioux City, a lot of the survivors exited through cracks in the fuselage. That's kind of the ultimate escape route, but you gotta do whatever you gotta do to get out."" He noted the January 15 ditching of a US Airways Airbus A320 in New York's Hudson River, in which no one was killed and injuries were minimal, although the craft quickly filled with cold water. ""That really demonstrated how important it is to get out quickly,"" Eakin said. Proximity of rescue equipment and personnel is key to survival too, Curtis said. If fires can be extinguished and survivors taken to hospitals quickly, victims have a better chance of surviving, he said. Despite his statistical evidence that the rear of the plane is safer, writer Noland doesn't seek out a back seat when he flies. ""I try to get a window seat,"" he said. ""Planes are so safe, it's unbelievable how safe they are. The odds of a crash are so minuscule that I don't even worry about it.""","Child reportedly survives crash of airliner in Indian Ocean .
Aviation experts say survival depends on type of impact, ""luck of the draw""

"(CNN) -- Not too long ago, the African stage belonged to Moammar Gadhafi. In flowing robes and wraparound sunglasses, he crisscrossed the continent in flashy caravans as throngs of supporters waved and cheered from the roadsides. Fellow African leaders bestowed upon him endearing nicknames: ""brother leader,"" ""king of kings of Africa."" And Libya was among the African Union's largest contributors, paying dues for some of the 54 member nations. But Gadhafi's regime now sits in ruins, leaving sub-Saharan Africa without a major investor who disbursed billions of dollars for roads, mosques and luxury hotels. ""He was known for handing out large sums of cash. Wherever he thinks he can buy friendship, he hands out large sums of cash,"" said Richard Dowden, executive director of the Royal African Society, a London-based group that aims to foster a better understanding of the continent. ""His investments bought him loyalty. It's a very African thing to do: 'He helped us, so let's help him'"" In Niger, which has given refuge to his son, Saadi Gadhafi, the ousted leader's influence is evident. A gleaming mosque built by the Libyan government in the 1970s stands tall in the capital of Niamey. Thousands attend prayers at the mosque -- a valuable gift to the poor Muslim country where crowds pack into limited worship spaces. Next door in Mali, Gadhafi funded the construction of a popular mosque in the capital Bamako, and helped pay for a Malian government complex that's under construction. Gadhafi also poured money into neighboring Chad and Burkina Faso as well. Such investments sealed Gadhafi's clout in sub-Saharan Africa. It came as no surprise that some leaders were initially reluctant to endorse the new Libyan interim government, analysts say. ""Whoever ... builds infrastructure, provides cheap products for markets and loans to support government initiatives will always have an influence over Africa affairs,"" said Ayo Johnson, director of Viewpoint Africa, an organization that sells content about Africa to media outlets internationally. Another reason many in the continent backed Gadhafi was self-preservation, analysts say. ""Some African leaders think that if they don't support Gadhafi now, next time round it could be them and who will take them in?"" Johnson said. ""This move guarantees some protection should there be an uprising in their countries ... they can count on each other."" For their part, some continent leaders say they did not rush to recognize the new Libyan leadership because the international community overstepped its boundaries. South African President Jacob Zuma, who joined the African Union in recognizing the new leadership last month, said NATO's military intervention in Libya undermined efforts by the pan-African body to find peaceful solutions for member states. In Africa, Gadhafi's influence extended beyond his generosity. His ideas and eccentricity were also a big draw, analysts say. During his term as chairman of the African Union in 2009, he renewed his calls for a ""United States of Africa"" that would use a single passport, a single military and a single currency. He had proposed a similar concept for Arab unity, but was rebuffed. ""The Arab world did not like him, and he had no choice because they were not as easy to push around,"" said Abdul Raufu Mustapha, a professor of African politics at Oxford University. ""He turned to sub-Saharan Africa... They had a lot of struggling nations"" So, while some sub-Saharan African leaders considered Gadhafi's vision of a unified Africa unrealistic, they nevertheless hailed it as one advocating pan-African cooperation. ""He sang the liberation song very well, and a lot of people connected with that because that still strikes a chord,"" Dowden said. Also propelling Gadhafi's popularity in the region: his anti-Western tirades. ""Both Gadhafi and Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe dare to stand up against the West ... they are seen as Africa bad boys and wear their medals with pride,"" Johnson said. ""He who stands up and shouts the most is usually revered."" Johnson described Gadhafi as ""the rogue school bully"" who, despite the fact that his actions may not be condoned, commands respect for challenging the status quo. And there were plenty of Gadhafi investments that were condemnable, analysts say. His support of brutal dictators, such as former strongman Charles Taylor of Liberia, helped intensify the bloodshed in the region, Dowden said. Taylor, who led Liberia from 1997 to 2003, is accused of fueling a bloody civil war in his nation and neighboring Sierra Leone that led to widespread murder, rape and mutilation. Gadhafi is also accused of helping arm Arab militias in Sudan's violence-wracked Darfur region. And he backed rebel groups in several countries including the Tuaregs in Mali and Niger, who were responsible for violence in the 1990s. The new Libyan government has said it believes the Tuareg tribe is currently protecting the fallen leader. ""Gadhafi supported a lot of West African revolutions that led to a lot of bloodshed and civil wars,"" Dowden said. ""He funded and helped create those revolutions."" During Libya's civil war, the gambit paid off. As rebel forces advanced, seizing town after town, Gadhafi called in fighters from non-Arab nations for backup, analysts say. Some fighters are from countries ""beholden to him"" and those fleeing the grinding poverty in their homelands, Mustapha said. On the other hand, Gadhafi also financially supported the African National Congress in its fight to end apartheid in South Africa, according to Dowden. ""Even while he was funding rebels, he was also funding liberation movements. We cannot take that from him,"" Dowden said. This dichotomy makes Gadhafi's legacy in the continent a tricky one, analysts say. ""Whoever writes the final chapter will have a difficult balancing act with a man who has a complex schizophrenic relationship with the world,"" Johnson said. ""Love him or hate him. Madman or god?"" So what awaits Africa now that Gadhafi is no longer in power? ""There are two big elephants in the room,"" said Robert Taiwo, director of Whitespace Advisory, a global firm that works with companies looking to invest in Africa. Will Gadhafi's absence lead to gaps in infrastructure investment in some of the countries? And if so, how will those countries cope? ""According to the World Bank, the infrastructure funding gap in Africa is approximately $31 billion per year. It also appears that Gadhafi has invested in some of the poorest and most fragile regions in Africa,"" Taiwo said. In the long run, the international community may have to step in to fill the gaps, he said. But for now, the ripple effects are already reverberating. In Niger, long a recipient of Gadhafi's largesse, a road funded by the ousted leader lies unfinished.

"(CNN) -- Viking raiders once landed on British soil to change the face of the nation -- and 1200 years later a group of muscly Minnesota Vikings gained further ground in the NFL's sporting invasion of the British Isles. The victorious Vikings landed another blow for American football Sunday as the team staged an exciting 34-27 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers in London. The team's 28-year-old star running back Adrian Peterson and Greg Jennings scored two touchdowns apiece. It was an important first win of the season for the Vikings but the entertaining game could have even greater significance for the NFL's hopes of establishing a European franchise. A regular season game was first played in London in 2007 but, for the first time this season, two games were scheduled on the opposite side of the Atlantic. Next month the Jackonsonville Jaguars face the San Francisco 49ers. Both NFL games at Wembley Stadium sold out within hours. Organizers of the NFL's London foray stirred the fever further Saturday as they held a block party for an estimated half a million fans on the streets of central London . Tailgate yearning . ""It is a sign that the game is growing globally,"" NFL commissioner Roger Goodell told NFLUK.com earlier this year. ""I think the message is clear. There are passionate fans who love the NFL in the UK."" There were also plenty of domestic fans who were happy to travel to London to support their teams. ""I love it,"" Richard from Pittsburgh, who now lives in Hollywood, told CNN. ""It's a really good idea. ""It gets the Steelers brand out there internationally as a big team."" Dan from New York added: ""I love the pub atmosphere in London. Although American culture is the tailgate, which I'm not seeing here!"" Perhaps not every facet of the American football experience can so easily translate to British shores where soccer, rugby and cricket hold sway as the most popular spectator sports. But that is not deterring the NFL from pressing on with its mission to gain new ground in Europe. American football is just that, an American sport, but if the sport can successfully ""go global"" that presents the NFL with new markets and new business opportunities. Profit not a priority . ""This is an investment and we are trying to grow something,"" Alistair Kirkwood, managing director of NFL UK, told CNN. ""We are not concerned about profit yet. ""But for the last two years our games have broken merchandise records for Wembley for all events -- and that includes pop concerts."" Developing the NFL in London, or any European franchise for that matter, does not come without its problems. ""There are multiple challenges,"" USA Today's NFL writer Tom Pelissero, who was at the game in London, explained to CNN. ""Travel would scare off a lot of potential free agents, it could be hard for a team to be competitive just because of that. ""The tax [in the UK] is another issue, 45% is the top tax bracket. That is something that, again, could scare off players from coming over. ""It also comes down to the fan base being large enough. You can fill Wembley with 80,000 people once, twice this year, but can you do that for 10 games a year? I think that's the one of the many unknowns. ""If you put a team in London, I don't think it would be difficult to make a profit. ""But what do you do when [they] have to play 10 games in the United States? How do you get them to travel? Do any of the visiting fans travel at all? That's an entirely different sort of issue."" Troublesome travels . Steve, who made the journey from London to New York, was also skeptical about the reality that NFL could become a regular fixture in London. ""The time zones and travel present a serious issue,"" he told CNN. ""To have a global sport that's weekly is troublesome. If you break it up into something that is less frequent than weekly and that allows for serious travel then it makes sense. ""[A London franchise] is a great idea, the NFL would make a ton of money out of it. I just haven't figured out how it could work!"" The man in charge of the game, Commissioner Goodell, is also juggling the numbers to work out how to develop the game away from north American shores. ""What is the next step? Do we move to three games, are there other ways to grow the game in the UK?"" he said. ""This is a market where we need to be more active and to grow our game."" For now, Peterson -- who had never been outside the U.S. before his trip to London -- and his fellow Viking raiders can feel satisfied with winning the game, as well as perhaps inching the NFL a little closer to a permanent place on sport's European map.","The NFL returned to London for first of two games at Wembley Stadium this season .
Minnesota Vikings defeated Pittsburgh Steelers 34-27 in thrilling game .
NFL organizers want to continue to invest in European games .
But fans and experts alike warn there are many logistical problems still to be resolved ."
"(CNN) -- Everton held on to their mantle as the only unbeaten team in the Premier League this season with a 3-2 win over Newcastle. Romelu Lukaku was a livewire on his home debut for the Liverpool club, scoring twice and setting up English teenager Ross Barkley for Everton's second. The 20 year old Belgian, who is on a season long loan from Chelsea, signalled to his compatriot Kevin Mirallas that he wanted the ball in the box with less than five minutes on the clock. Mirallas duly delivered and Lukaku dinked it in to set Everton on their way. The ball travelled from one end to the other for Lukaku's second in a perfect example of the much aligned long ball football. Everton keeper Tim Howard sent the ball sailing up field and Lukaku got on the end of the American's mammoth kick to slide the ball past a flailing Tim Krul. Try as he might the hat trick did not come for Lukaku as Newcastle pegged back the home side in the second half. Substitute Yohan Cabaye conjured a wonderful strike from range to close the gap before fellow France international Loic Remy stabbed in the ball for a second with 88 minutes on the clock. It was a nervy finish for Everton as Remy came close to grabbing the equalizer but the home side held on. Roberto Martinez's team moved up to fourth in the table while Newcastle continue to hover near the relegation zone.","Everton remain the only unbeaten team in the Premier League with 3-2 win over Newcastle .

"(CNN) -- Millions of Gulf Coast residents dealt Tuesday with the ghosts of Hurricane Katrina and the real-and-present danger of Hurricane Isaac, which made landfall Tuesday night in southeastern Louisiana. River waters rising fast . Near Biloxi, Mississippi, shrimpers and other fishermen sought shelter on the Tchoutacabouffa River, 15 miles from the Gulf of Mexico. While they appeared safe, the same couldn't be said for land and property along the water. By 2 p.m. CT, before much rain had fallen, the river was already several feet higher than normal, resident and CNN iReporter Jim Yelverton said. And that was at low tide. ""It's rising a lot faster than anyone expected,"" said Yelverton, who expressed fears that things could get much worse at high tide Wednesday morning. ""What may happen is that the water surge will get to the structures and tear them apart."" Keep a hurricane preparation checklist . 'Katrina is not a taboo subject' By midafternoon Tuesday, 400 residents of Plaquemines Parish, southeast of New Orleans, were calling a shelter in Belle Chasse home. ""It's a mix of people,"" said Gina Meyer, superintendent of emergency medical services with the parish. ""You treat them like family. You ask how they are doing and sit down and talk with them. These people are so resilient."" Many of the evacuees endured Hurricane Katrina seven years ago. ""Katrina is not a taboo subject with us. It is reality,"" said Meyer. ""They are not afraid to talk about it, (but) they don't beat a dead horse."" The evacuees, who are sleeping on cots, are ""consistently thankful,"" Meyer said. Town on Louisiana barrier island empties . Grand Isle in Jefferson Parish was transformed Tuesday into a tropical ghost town -- its mayor saying that all but 30 people heeded evacuation orders and headed to dryer locales. By afternoon, the only evident activity was among a few emergency personnel riding around town. And as the day wore on, Mother Nature introduced herself in a big way. The barrier island was lashed by strong winds paired with heavy rains, which then subsided. A few minutes later, another such band would move through -- each successive one typically stronger than the next. By early Tuesday evening, winds gusted past 60 mph, and they were only climbing higher. Preparing for a storm: Links, tips and resources . 'Where are the people who lived here prior to Katrina?' CNN iReporter Eileen Romero lost everything in 2005 to Hurricane Katrina. She still lives in New Orleans, now in a different neighborhood and in a house built in 1908. Romero went out Tuesday to take photographs. ""I am not seeing people real concerned to be honest,"" she said. ""I think there is a false sense of security. Everybody talks about how we party all the time. When hurricanes are coming, people have hurricane parties."" While she didn't believe Isaac would cause near the damage wrought by Katrina, the student said she was nervous. ""Everything reminds you of Katrina. When the wind howls, I think of Katrina. I don't think of Isaac."" Romero said many residents of public housing apartments have not returned since 2005. ""Where are the people who lived here prior to Katrina?"" she asked.

"(CNN) -- Food giant Nestle, which has clocked up better than expected growth despite the economic downturn, is now extending micro credit to its suppliers to get them through the tough times. According to Nestle CEO Paul Bulcke, the move strengthens relationships with suppliers in the long-term, and is worth the short term hit on working capital. As the economic downturn squeezes credit, the move allows smaller businesses to stay afloat until the wider economy improves. ""We're [lending funds to] farmers, for example, who would not get money from the banks,"" says Bulcke. He says the company has financed around $40 million of micro-loans to farms. ""In a downturn, where credit is harsh and hard, we actually extend that to maintain these relationships and possibly to have these suppliers longer term,"" Bulcke explains. Bulcke says Nestle is focused on long term gains, such as the relationship with suppliers. Thinking short term is ""deadly,"" he says. ""We should never compromise the long term for a short term gain,"" Bulcke says. ""In a crisis you are strongly invited to go for the short-term and have a quick fix. I think if that is at the cost of the long-term you don't do favor for your company.""

"Columbus, Ohio (CNN) -- President Barack Obama took on critics of his energy policies Thursday, saying in carefully coordinated speeches that they weren't paying attention to increased oil production at home and were misleading the public about the cause of rising gas prices. ""Anyone who says that we're somehow suppressing domestic oil production isn't paying attention,"" Obama said in Cushing, Oklahoma, on the second day of a four-state tour to tout his policies. ""And anyone who says that just drilling more will bring gas prices down just isn't playing it straight,"" the president continued. "" We are drilling more. We are producing more. But the fact is, producing more oil at home isn't enough to bring gas prices down overnight."" In Cushing and a later speech at The Ohio State University, Obama repeated his call for a diversified policy that increases production of traditional energy sources such as oil and natural gas while increasing investment in alternative sources such as solar, wind and hydrogen power to compete in growing global clean energy markets. In particular, he rejected Republican claims that U.S. oil reserves alone offer a solution to higher gas prices and long-term supplies. ""Even if we drilled every little bit of this great country of ours, we'd still have to buy enough from the rest of the world to meet our needs,"" Obama said in Cushing. He added that ""the price of oil is set by the global market, and that means every time tensions rise in the Middle East, so will gas prices at home."" In particular, Obama said, rising tension involving Iran was causing the current spike in global oil prices. At Ohio State, Obama emphasized to a cheering student crowd that since he took office in 2009, ""America's dependence on foreign oil has gone down every single year."" ""Even as the economy was growing, we've made progress in reducing the amount of oil we have to import because we're being smarter, we're doing things better,"" the president said. Romney turns up heat on Obama energy policies . The whirlwind trip over two days followed weeks of criticism of his approach to gas price increases by Republicans on Capitol Hill and the presidential campaign trail. ""He has an energy policy that is very simple,"" Rick Santorum said of the president during a campaign stop Monday in Illinois. ""You can sum it up in two letters, N-O. He is against everything that will create economic incentives to drill."" Newt Gingrich has made reducing prices at the pump a central promise of his campaign, telling voters at a recent event in Birmingham, Alabama, that ""an American president who believed in energy and an American president who believed in science and technology would drive the price of gasoline below $2."" Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl sounded a similar refrain after a Republican caucus meeting in early March, agreeing with the president's all-of-the-above approach, but adding, ""We need it in action, not just words."" A focus of Republican attacks has been the delay in administration approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada's tar sands production in northern Alberta to the Gulf Coast. Keystone pipeline: Separating rhetoric from reality . Last year, the administration put off a decision until 2013 after protests by environmentalists concerned about high carbon emissions from tar sands oil production and objections by Nebraska officials to a route near a vital aquifer. Republicans in Congress, accusing Obama of avoiding the issue until after the November election, tried to speed the process by tacking a measure requiring an immediate decision to the temporary payroll tax cut bill last December. The Obama administration then rejected the pipeline permit in January, saying an alternate route from Nebraska had yet to be decided. Since then, Republicans have persisted in attacking Obama for rejecting the permit. The president announced Thursday in Cushing that he was using his executive authority to order federal agencies to expedite the approval process for large-scale infrastructure projects like oil pipelines. More specifically, he ordered the portion of the Keystone XL pipeline running from Cushing to the Gulf to be placed at the top of the list. ""We're making this new pipeline from Cushing to the Gulf a priority,"" Obama said to cheers, later adding that ""as long as I'm president, we're going to keep encouraging oil development and infrastructure and we're going to do it in a way that protects the health and safety of the American people. We don't have to choose between one or the other. We can do both."" Many private companies -- including TransCanada, the Canadian company behind the Keystone XL project -- are working to build pipelines that relieve the bottleneck of oil in Cushing, a major hub for crude oil storage and trade. While federal agencies like the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of the Interior have some involvement in the approval process for the domestic portion of the pipeline, the federal government has relatively little control when compared to the absolute say it holds over the portion that crosses the international border with Canada. The ultimate decision-making authority for the pipeline's domestic route lies mainly with the states it crosses, prompting Republicans to question whether the president can actually claim any credit for speeding the project along. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, told reporters Thursday that Obama was claiming credit he didn't deserve on the southern leg of the Keystone pipeline while continuing to prevent construction on the northern leg from Canada. ""It's already gotten its approvals and this idea that the president is going to expedite this will have no impact on the construction of this pipeline,"" Boehner said of the Cushing-Gulf Coast portion. ""The president has continued to block development of oil and gas reserves, big reserves, on federal lands. And he can go out and make all the noise that he wants, but the facts are there."" Poll: Majority say build Keystone pipeline . On Wednesday, Obama kicked off his energy tour with stops in Boulder City, Nevada, and Maljamar, New Mexico, to focus on work on alternative energy sources. The visit to Boulder City was designed to tout the success of solar technology at the largest photovoltaic solar facility in the nation. Photovoltaic solar panels create energy directly from sunlight without the need for any water or moving parts. Obama acknowledged the high prices at the pump, but used the problem as a reason to abandon federal ""subsidies"" to oil and gas companies. ""We want to encourage production of oil and gas, and make sure that wherever we've got American resources, we are tapping into them,"" the president said. ""But they don't need an additional incentive when gas is $3.75 a gallon, when oil is $120 a barrel, $125 a barrel. They don't need additional incentives. They're doing fine."" What the president calls subsidies, the petroleum industry calls the same tax breaks afforded those in many other industries. The push to end what Obama deems to be preferential treatment to a petroleum industry that's never been more profitable was central to his two-day tour, but the president also used the trip to push back against those who call federal aid to the renewable energy industry a waste of money. ""Some of these folks want to dismiss the promise of solar power and wind power and fuel-efficient cars,"" Obama said in Boulder City. ""In fact, they make jokes about it. One member of Congress who shall remain unnamed called these jobs 'phony' -- called them phony jobs. I mean, think about that mindset, that attitude that says because something is new, it must not be real. If these guys were around when Columbus set sail, they'd be charter members of the Flat Earth Society."" With nearly a million solar panels spread across 450 acres, Copper Mountain 1 in Boulder City provides power for roughly 17,000 homes, but employs just 10 full-time employees. The solar plant's owner, Sempra U.S. Gas & Power, is in the process of building a second facility nearby that's set to more than triple the output of Copper Mountain 1. Construction of the second facility -- Copper Mountain 2 -- has created 175 temporary jobs but, according to Sempra's own projections, the final solar plant will result in just five full-time positions.

"(CNN) -- David Nalbandian has announced his retirement from tennis after failing to overcome a troublesome shoulder injury. The 31-year-old, who reached the semifinal of every grand slam and finished as runner up to Lleyton Hewitt at Wimbledon in 2002, reached a career high of No.3 in the world back in March 2006. ""It's a sad day but the shoulder is not responding well,"" he told a press conference in Buenos Aires Tuesday. ""As a result I can no longer compete at ATP level."" Nalbandian, currently ranked 231 in the world, has been blighted by injuries in recent years and has failed to repeat the exploits of his younger years. The last of his 11 singles titles came in Washington three years ago. Nalbandian became the first ever Argentine to reach the Wimbledon final and first from South American to do so since 1959. In 2005, he became the first Argentine to win the year-end championship since Guillermo Vilas triumphed in 1974. But it was his determination to help his country win the Davis Cup which endeared him to his fans. He boasted a 39-11 record and helped Argentina finish as runner up in 2006, 2008 and 2011. ""It's the event that I felt was different from the others,"" he said of the Davis Cup. ""The pressure, the support of the people. It's something unique. It's a shame [Argentina] couldn't win it, but it's the way it was."" Nalbandian has been hampered with injuries since undergoing shoulder surgery in 2009. He underwent further surgery on his hip and shoulder in May after suffering injury interrupted seasons for the past three years. A fiery and determined competitor, he courted controversy in June 2012 after being disqualified in the ATP Queen's Club final after kicking down an advertising board which injured a court side official. Line judge Andrew McDougall suffered a gash to his leg and stood up to protest to the player. Nalbandian was officially defaulted for ""unsportsmanlike behavior"" before returning to apologize to the crowd. His final appearance will be an exhibition match against Rafael Nadal on November 23 in Buenos Aires.","David Nalbandian has announced his retirement from tennis .

"(CNN) -- Christmas is synonymous with colorful decorations, festive markets and extravagant quantities of food. But while most yuletide celebrations share these general characteristics, there are of course a host of distinctive traditions and regional variations depending on where you are in the world. That's why CNN asked you to show us exactly how Christmas is celebrated where you live. From the Philippines to Germany to Colombia and even the Pacific island of Tonga, we received over 400 wonderfully vivid submissions. Christmas would obviously not be Christmas without Santa Claus, or Father Christmas, or Pere Noel. Whatever the name, his popularity among children (and many adults) is perennial. See also: Where is the world's most Christmassy destination . Greg Reese from Cincinnati, Ohio, sent in these images of 'Santa-Con' in his home city -- an annual event where people come dressed up as Santa Claus and tread the streets doling out candy. ""It's essentially a gathering of like-minded individuals who wish to both get into the Christmas spirit, as well as spread Christmas cheer to their fellow man,"" said Reese. Thousands of miles away, the Philippines hosts some of the most lavish Christmas celebrations in the world -- starting in September and ending in January. They also have some of the most colorful and fascinating traditions around the holiday. Nathaniel Molines from San Pedro in Laguna province, the Philippines, sent in these beautiful images of parols -- lanterns made traditionally from bamboo and paper used to light the way to church for worshipers living in darkened rural areas. ""This is a simple decoration that tells us that Christmas is in every corner, love is in the air,"" he said. ""I took the picture because it reminds me the value of celebrating Christmas here in the Philippines."" Lights of a similar design were spotted thousands of miles away in Shanghai, China, by Dutch expat Irene Reijs, who captured a beautiful image of a delivery man doggedly trundling along on his bike with his wares crammed into a delivery box. ""This photo for me represents Shanghai. Everything you can imagine is being delivered by these men and women on their bikes,"" she said.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A motorist pleaded not guilty Tuesday to one count of murder and multiple other charges, three days after he allegedly drove his car into pedestrians at the famed Venice Beach Boardwalk in California, killing an Italian honeymooner. Nathan Louis Campbell, 38, is charged with murder, 16 counts of assault with a deadly weapon and 17 counts of hit-and-run, said Deputy District Attorney Gary Hearnsberger. The charges include the special allegation of use of a deadly weapon, a car. Campbell, who was being held on $1.48 million bail, could face a life sentence if convicted. Campbell, wearing a blue jail jumpsuit at his arraignment, was handcuffed at the waist and wrists. When asked whether he wanted to waive his right to a speedy trial, Campbell answered, ""Yes, sir"" during the brief appearance. Police: Driver 'bent on doing evil' His court-appointed attorney, Philip Dube, said his client was ""very distraught"" over the incident, but did not deliberately strike anyone. ""I don't believe he intentionally tried to hit anybody, based on my cursory review of the case and my discussions with the D.A.,"" said Dube. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Keith L. Schwartz set the next hearing for September 4. He and attorneys will discuss scheduling a preliminary hearing. Campbell is accused of driving his 2008 Dodge Avenger onto the boardwalk, killing 32-year-old Alice Gruppioni of Italy. She suffered blunt trauma to the head and neck, according to Los Angeles County coroner spokesman Ed Winter. Eight women and eight men were hurt Saturday, authorities said. ""It was horrible. I mean it was like something out of a movie, something you would never expect to see,"" witness Katherine Blackburn told CNN affiliate KABC. The city boardwalk is a popular tourist attraction on the west side of Los Angeles, and is lined with hundreds of street vendors and performers. 15 injured at Venice Beach out of hospital . Police said Campbell abandoned the vehicle a few miles from the Venice Beach incident and turned himself into Santa Monica police about two hours later. In a statement, Gruppioni's family expressed thanks for prayers from ""so many around the world."" ""No words can adequately express the grief and sorrow we are feeling as we mourn the loss of a beautiful person, family member and young bride,"" the family said. ""Thank you all for your concerns as we begin to search for answers."" New details emerged Tuesday about Campbell, who once worked at a residential substance abuse center in Denver, Colorado. Campbell was a chef and house manager at the Phoenix Concept from April 2010 to February 2012, said David Hall, program director for the Sobriety House Drug and Alcohol Treatment Center. Campbell returned in December 2012 and worked until June before leaving, said Hall who declined to state the reason for his departure. ""While he was here he was a good employee and never had any issues that raised concern,"" said Hall. According to its website, the Phoenix Concept merged with Sobriety House in October 2007.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama castigated the North Korean government Monday for conducting a second nuclear bomb test in defiance of multiple international warnings. President Obama calls North Korea's nuclear test ""a grave threat to the peace and stability of the world."" North Korea's actions ""pose a grave threat to the peace and stability of the world,"" Obama said at the White House. Obama promised that the United States and the international community would strongly respond to the test. He added that North Korea's actions have ""flown in the face of United Nations resolutions"" and were inviting deeper international isolation for the communist state.  Watch how U.S. is reacting to the test » . North Korea's state news agency reported the nuclear detonation a little more than an hour after the U.S. Geological Survey reported a magnitude 4.7 seismic disturbance at the site of North Korea's first nuclear test, which occurred in October 2006. The state-run Korean Central News Agency said Monday's test was conducted ""as part of the measures to bolster up its nuclear deterrent for self-defense in every way."" In a one-two punch, the secretive communist state also apparently test-fired a short-range missile on Monday, the White House said. The U.N. Security Council is scheduled to meet at 4 p.m. ET Monday to discuss possible responses to North Korea's actions. In an earlier White House statement, Obama called Pyongyang's actions ""a matter of grave concern to all nations."" ""By acting in blatant defiance of the United Nations Security Council, North Korea is directly and recklessly challenging the international community,"" the statement said. ""North Korea's behavior increases tensions and undermines stability in Northeast Asia. Such provocations will only serve to deepen North Korea's isolation."" The top-ranking U.S. military officer said Monday that North Korea's reported nuclear test is a primarily a diplomatic matter right now, not a military one. ""I think it's really important ... right now to emphasize the diplomatic path,"" Adm. Mike  Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told CNN's ""American Morning."" ""That's really the one they're on."" ""Obviously we've got forces deployed to that part of the world, we have had for a significant period of time, we've got over 25,000 troops who are stationed in South Korea,"" he added. ""We've got very close alliances there with Japan and South Korea as well. ... The countries who are involved in [the six-party talks], I think, are absolutely critical as we move forward to address this increasingly belligerent challenge from North Korea."" Mullen said the test did not come as a surprise to the United States. ""We weren't surprised because of recent statements by North Korean leadership that they intended to do this,"" he said. ""As you know, they also recently ... unsuccessfully launched potentially an intercontinental ballistic missile."" He said the reported test shows Pyongyang is becoming ""increasingly belligerent."" Most other countries have denounced the test. Even China -- North Korea's strongest ally -- said it opposed the test. China's government ""expresses firm opposition"" to the test, in which North Korea ""disregarded the opposition of the international community,"" according to a statement from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.","NEW: Obama promises strong reaction to North Korean nuclear test .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Tony Scott's fatal plunge from a California bridge Sunday remained a public mystery Tuesday as medical investigators and his family disputed a report that the British director suffered from inoperable brain cancer. Scott, best known for the films ""Top Gun"" and ""Beverly Hills Cop II,"" apparently committed suicide by jumping from the Vincent Thomas Bridge in San Pedro, California, about 12:30 p.m. Sunday, said Lt. Joe Bale of the coroner's office. Scott, 68, wrote two notes before his death, including a message left in his Los Angeles office that was apparently for family members, a coroner official said. The second note, detailing contact information for authorities investigating his death, was found in his Toyota Prius parked nearby, the official said. Investigators would not say what clues those notes may have given them concerning Scott's motivation for suicide, which Bale said was the apparent cause of death. ""There's nothing to indicate it is anything else at this time,"" he said Monday. Director Tony Scott: An appreciation . It will be weeks before the findings of Monday's autopsy are made public, the coroner's office said Tuesday. ""Our examination is complete and we will be working towards a comprehensive document once we close the case,"" Deputy Chief Coroner Ed Winter said. An ABC report Monday suggested the director was scripting his own death after being told by a doctor that he was dying of inoperable brain cancer. The network did not name the source of its information. ""I did talk to the family yesterday late afternoon, and according to his wife, he did not have brain cancer as reported, and (she) does not know who told ABC that information, which is absolutely false,"" Winter said. Scott's unexplained death shocked the Hollywood stars who worked with him on a long list of successful movies over the past three decades. Denzel Washington, who starred in several Scott-directed thrillers -- including 2010's ""Unstoppable"" -- said it was ""unfathomable to think that he is now gone."" Tony Scott: Unstoppable Hollywood force . ""He had a tremendous passion for life and for the art of filmmaking and was able to share this passion with all of us through his cinematic brilliance,"" he said. Born Anthony D.L. Scott in North Shields, England, in 1944, the director got his start as a teenager in front of the camera, starring in his older brother Ridley Scott's film ""Boy and Bicycle."" In 1995, the two joined forces to create the production company Scott Free Productions. Tony Scott became a household name in 1986 as director of the mega-hit ""Top Gun,"" starring Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis. He followed that up with the Eddie Murphy action movie ""Beverly Hills Cop II"" in 1987. Both Cruise and Murphy released statements mourning the loss of their director. ""Tony was my dear friend and I will really miss him. He was a creative visionary whose mark on film is immeasurable. My deepest sorrow and thoughts are with his family at this time,"" Cruise said. Scott made tense films for jittery times . Murphy described Scott as a ""wonderful collaborator"" and said he will be missed. Pepperdine University film professor Craig Detweiler called Scott ""the supreme stylist"" who ""operated at the top of his game throughout each decade of his career."" ""He was able to make the thinnest of premises into something pulse-pounding and exciting, and he's almost a filmmaker as a magician who found drama amidst almost contrived situations,"" he said. Taking his own life by jumping from a bridge is ""a high-adrenaline ending, which matches his dramatic style,"" Detweiler said. ""He put Denzel Washington, Will Smith and Tom Cruise in movies where one man overcomes all struggles, triumphs over struggles, and yet it appears he was not able to write that story for himself,"" he said. Actor Michael Rapaport, who was directed by Scott in ""True Romance,"" took to Twitter to praise the director. In one post, he said there hasn't been a day since the movie was released in 1993 that someone doesn't tell him how much they loved the film. ""Tony Scott was a sweet enthusiastic & lovin man,"" Rapaport wrote. Scott cemented his reputation for big-budget action films with 1990's ""Revenge"" starring Kevin Costner and ""Days of Thunder"" with Cruise. In 1998, he directed ""Enemy of the State"" with actors Smith and Gene Hackman. It was on the set of ""Days of Thunder"" where Scott met actress Donna Wilson, whom he married in 1994. They had twin sons. Reaction to Scott's death poured out Monday, with directors, actors and fans mourning the news. 11 Scott films we'll remember . ""Being around you was always the ultimate experience -- intensity, vitality and celebration. Pure rock and roll and great cigars. Your warmth and generosity was palpable to all us. You treated everyone with care and respect,"" said actor Edgar Ramirez, who starred in Scott's 2005 film, ""Domino."" ""You always focused on the subtleties, taking the best out of us. I am proud to be your friend, and although I won't be seeing you for a while, you will live on in the laughter of our memories of you."" ""Tony Scott as a friend and a mentor was irreplaceable. Tone, wherever you are, I love you man. RIP,"" director and producer Joe Carnahan said on Twitter. Carnahan recounted how when his movie ""The Grey"" was finished, Scott called to tell him he had seen it. He told Carnahan it was great and not to allow anybody to change anything in it. ""Tony always sent personal, handwritten notes & always drew a cartoon caricature of himself, smoking a cigar, with his hat colored in red,"" Carnahan said in a post. Psychiatrist: I hate suicide but also understand it . Scott directed his last film, the train thriller ""Unstoppable"" starring Washington, in 2010. ""For me, it was the most challenging movie of my life, and the most dangerous because I'm shooting 90 percent of the movie on a train that is running between 50 and 70 mph,"" Scott told CNN at the time. Scott's reputation in Hollywood was low-key. ""He wasn't a showy kind of guy,"" longtime entertainment reporter Jeanne Wolf told CNN. Scott was often seen sporting a frayed, faded red ball cap on movie sets and at red carpet premieres. The ball cap, Wolf said, was his trademark. While Scott's movies garnered box office success, they never received the acclaim that generated Academy Award nominations. In 2002, the Scott brothers won an Emmy for the television movie ""The Gathering Storm."" Scott also was nominated for the Emmy as a producer for the CBS drama ""The Good Wife."" ""So very, very sorry to hear of the death of Tony Scott,"" actress Martha Plimpton, who appeared in ""The Good Wife,"" said via Twitter. Among his last projects was serving as an executive producer on the TV miniseries ""Coma,"" which is due to air this year. People we've lost in 2012: The lives they lived .

"(CNN) -- When the biggest United Nations (U.N.) climate change talks of the year, COP18, get underway in Doha, the capital of Qatar, this week, it will be the first time that the meeting has been hosted by a Middle Eastern country. As such, the talks provide the perfect opportunity for the countries in the region to prove that they have started to take climate change seriously. The best way to start proving that is to first pledge targets to reduce their carbon emissions. The Middle East has been through a lot of change lately, but the region is often eerily quiet on climate change, not to mention that some countries of the region have been considered ""obstructionist"" in the process. This has been making a lot of countries coming to the negotiations very nervous. The U.N. climate summit offers the opportunity for the ""obstructionist"" reputation to change, if the Arab communities play it right. Putting forward pledges to the international community is one step that countries of the region can take in the right direction, but also regional civil society should start a strong Arab climate movement. Read: Greenhouse gases reach record highs . This has already started, and one only needs to look at the launch of the Arab Youth Climate Movement in a dozen countries earlier this month to see that the region's young citizens, who were so instrumental in the Arab Spring, are calling for their leaders to step up when it comes to the biggest environmental problem facing the Middle East and North Africa. Of course, COP18 is not only about what the Arab world will do, but about what the rest of the world will do. COP18 is a key transition conference, where old negotiations tracks need to be finalized, and new ones started. One key tough issue that parties need to crack is when global carbon emissions need to peak and start declining rapidly. According to science, emissions should peak by 2015, if, we want to have a chance of keeping global warming within two degrees Celsius. While a two degrees temperature rise is not without risks -- as this year's already worsening weather events such as Hurricane Sandy and the droughts in Russia and the U.S. have shown -- it is a target which can be realistically achieved by our leaders. Agreeing to this peak will also mean that countries which have been big polluters historically, like the U.S., Canada, Europe, Japan and Australia, will have to increase their commitments on carbon emission reductions. The Kyoto Protocol is currently our only binding climate deal and it is up for renewal here at Doha. This should happen only after closing all the gaps that make this Protocol weaker. Read: Chasing down the world's vanishing glaciers . While all this might seem difficult to achieve, failing to make progress at Doha would constitute a huge cost to society. A peer reviewed report, called ""Beyond dangerous climate change: emission scenarios for a new world,"" written by Kevin Anderson and Alice Bows in 2011, pointed out that there is a widespread understanding among scientists that an increase of four degrees Celsius in global temperatures is incompatible with an organized global community. This means that if we don't start reducing our greenhouse gas emissions urgently, it could lead to the collapse of human civilization. Our current emission patterns are leading us to a 2.5 to five degrees increase before the end of this century. So far the world has only warmed 0.8 degrees Celsius, and we are already witnessing severe weather phenomena. With the latest estimates saying Hurricane Sandy killed over 100 people and will end up costing $50 billion in the U.S. alone, it makes sense on economic and humanitarian fronts to fund stringent responses to climate change. Nevertheless, there is real hope building around the potential of the Doha meeting. Compared to last year's negotiations, the political climate change leadership in China and the U.S. -- both major emitters with big pull at these talks -- is now certain. Newly reelected President Obama called for climate action in his victory speech and China's new leader Xi Jiping called for a ""better environment"" in his acceptance. Civil society is expecting these leaders to stand up where it matters -- inside the negotiating rooms of the U.N. climate talks and push toward a fair, ambitious and binding deal that will preserve the future of the planet for generations to come. The views expressed in this article are solely those of Wael Hmaidan.","Lebanese environmental activist, Wael Hmaidan calls for Middle Eastern countries to pledge support for climate action .

"Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN) -- South Florida authorities are asking for the public's help to find a group of ""foxy thieves"" they say are drugging men they pick up at high-end bars and stealing tens of thousands of dollars in cash, jewelry, guns and other valuables. The Broward County Sheriff's Office released photos of the four suspects, all in their 20s, and have attained arrest warrants for them. Investigators suspect there may be more women involved in the ring. ""They're attractive women that go into a bar and they have a scam and they work it again and again,"" said Dani Moschella, a spokeswoman for the sheriff's office. The scam works like this: go to an upscale bar, flirt with a middle-age or older man wearing expensive jewelry, go back to his home, slip a drug in his drink, rob him and leave before he wakes up. This is what Subhanna Beyah, 25, Johnnina Miller, 25, Keshia Clark, 27 and Ryan Elkins, 23, have allegedly been doing for the past few months in upscale bars in South Florida. Hours after authorities released images of the suspects to the news media on Thursday, Clark turned herself in to Miami-Dade police, the Broward County Sheriff's Office said Friday. Investigators have identified four of the women's victims, Moschella said, adding that they believe other victims ""haven't come forward because they're embarrassed."" ""This investigation is by no means over,"" she added. ""We anticipate identifying other suspects and other victims."" Scott Rosen, 54, told CNN two of the suspects paired up when they worked the scam on him. Rosen said met the two women at YOLO, a popular bar in Fort Lauderdale's business district, and the three left the bar for his house. There, Rosen said, one of the women distracted him while the other made him a drink. ""I got drugged,"" Rosen said. The next thing Rosen remembers is waking up to discover over $250,000 worth of his personal items gone -- handguns, diamonds and a Rolex watch he was wearing -- along with the women. ""It could have been worse,"" he noted. ""They could have shot me with my own handgun."" The women, who allegedly used fake names during their ruses, are each being charged with one count of grand theft. Broward County authorities are eager to get these women in custody. The sheriff's office has joined with Crime Stoppers to offer a $1,000 reward for anonymous tips that lead to an arrest. ""We really want to get these women off the street ... because they're drugging their victims, presumably,"" Moschella said. ""We don't know how long it will be before they end up killing somebody accidentally.""","Broward County authorities have asked for help nabbing a ring of female thieves .

"(CNN) -- A police chief's profanity-laced rant in an online video against those who disagree with him on gun laws has generated controversy online and in a small eastern Pennsylvania town, with at least one elected official calling the behavior ""unacceptable."" Gilberton Police Chief Mark Kessler made the comments in videos posted to YouTube in mid-July that went viral, generating a heated online debate that appeared to gain renewed traction this week when he posted a backhanded apology. Now the fallout has reached the halls of government in the small town of just more than 750 people. The mayoral office was forced to close early Wednesday because of threatening calls, Mayor Mary Lou Hennon said on Thursday. A meeting is scheduled for next week to discuss personnel and work policy. ""We may or may not take action against him,"" Hennon said. Kessler did not respond to repeated requests by CNN for comment, but he told CNN affiliate WFMZ-TV that he was not in uniform in the videos and was exercising in his First and Second Amendment rights. In the videos, Kessler rails against liberals for attempting to curb gun rights and Secretary of State John Kerry over his support of a recent U.N. arms treaty. At one point in the video, he dares Kerry to come and take his guns. ""It wasn't a threat. It was, 'if you want them come and take them,'"" Kessler told the television station by telephone. Kessler has been the town's police chief for 14 years ""without a mark against him,"" Hennon said. ""Like a lot of other people, I found the video a little vulgar. It was like watching an R-rated movie,"" she said. ""We have no policies regarding people's personal use outside of work, and we allow freedom of speech. What people do on their personal time is their business."" Kessler, an outspoken gun rights advocate, has a history of making provocative statements. He has been featured in a number of online videos discussing his views, given numerous interviews and helped organize gun rights rallies. The police chief also has claimed in a number of interviews to be the founder of the Constitutional Security Force, a gun rights advocacy group. In the video, Kessler wears a T-shirt with CSF emblazoned on it. On the CSF Web page, Kessler is identified as the group's president and is featured in his Gilberton police uniform. The latest videos have been picked up and copied on YouTube, with titles such as ""America's scariest police chief"" and ""Patriot police chief."" In Gilberton, northeast of Harrisburg, resident Diane McCarthy told WFMZ that she found the videos disturbing. ""I think that kind of position needs to have respect of the community,"" she said. ""It's pretty difficult to have respect after seeing that."" Gilberton Borough Councilman Eric Boxter told the station the videos were ""over the top"" and ""unacceptable"" for a police chief.","Gilberton Police Chief Mark Kessler is an outspoken gun rights advocate .

"(CNN) -- It is no accident that Hanukkah comes in the darkest time of year. The winter holidays are about light, about miracles, and about waking up to light when it is least visible to the naked eye. Food-wise, we jolt our senses alive through texture, taste and flavor with fried foods that couple warmth, crispness, and the smoothness of oil in order to reinvigorate and fine-tune us just as the sun begins to seemingly disappear altogether. For some, Hanukkah is ""the potato pancake holiday"" -- a holiday that takes the mundane potato and gives it a massive makeover. It is shredded and tossed and recombined, squeezed and remolded into new form and then fried up lightly so that its texture shifts, its flavor alters. The latke (pancake) itself becomes the miracle of light, of oil, and of transformation. Read more: Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights . Hanukkah has always been this ""potato pancake holiday"" in my house. No matter what I serve, my family likes simple crispy potato latkes best. Yet in this vastly changing landscape of food, I have tried all different kinds: zucchini, beet, sweet potato, celery root, and apple-horseradish. The favorite is still simple potato. Today we have tiny latkes served with goat's cheese, tomatoes, herbs, or topped with smoked salmon and dill at latke and vodka parties. Topped with salmon, they make great appetizers. Potatoes have only been part of this holiday since the 18th century, when they came to Europe from the New World. The word latkes stuck, coming from ""platke"" in Ukrainian and potato pancakes spread throughout Europe. They came to the United States with immigrants from Eastern Europe at the end of the 19th century. I have celebrated Hanukkah throughout my life, lighting candles each night for eight nights to recall the miracle of the oil. I then have at least one dinner of slowly cooked brisket complemented by crisp fragrant potato latkes cooked in oil and, of course, homemade applesauce. More from CNN Celebrates: Your photos from Australia total solar eclipse . Yet of all the Hanukkahs of years past, the most memorable for me was spent in Israel with my children at the home of dear friends. As we walked past houses nearby, we saw the candles lit in the windows and everyone gathering with their own families. When we got to our friends, we lit the candles on several menorahs and had a festive meal. There were no latkes that night, only delicious Moroccan stuffed vegetables and sufganiyot, Israeli doughnuts stuffed with jam, much more popular than pancakes in the holy land. Unlike in America where there are too many presents, the highlight of this evening was being together with friends and family. I also remember taking my children with me to the shuk (marketplace) in downtown Jerusalem to buy our own sufganiyot. We waded through crowds of people excitedly waving their money at the bakers in what felt like a giant pastry auction, all so we could sink our teeth into these massive orbs of fried dough, still warm, dripping with jam. Share with us your defining moment of 2012 . These doughnuts were no laughing matter in Israel, and in America, for the years that followed, we made our own renditions. We were revamping our traditions so that the food and the family, more than the material gifts, were the markers of our joyful memories. For many years after, I went to my children's schools and helped teach the cafeteria staff about how to make jelly donuts from scratch. This was a process, again, of transforming the dough, that flat ball of flour, once something simple growing in the ground, and turning it into something both crispy and smooth, doughy, savory and sweet. The doughnut and the latke, more than the tradition of presents and gifts, were the bright light of our winter holiday. Through the mixer and past the frying pan, the flour and the potato and everything else we added over the years transformed before our very eyes -- reminding us of an ancient tradition meant to recall the miracle of light.

"(CNN) -- Usher Raymond's ex-wife is asking a judge to give her custody of their two children after the oldest suffered a ""near-death accident."" Five-year-old Usher Raymond V ""nearly drown in a swimming pool and is currently hospitalized in the intensive care unit of the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Hospital,"" Tameka Raymond said in an emergency motion filed in a Fulton County, Georgia, court Tuesday. In a statement released Wednesday, the singer said his son ""is doing well and is recovering."" The statement did not address his ex-wife's motion for custody. ""I am overwhelmed by the outpouring of prayers, love and support for my family's well-being,"" the statement said. Usher, as he is known professionally in his career as a singer, dancer and actor, won primary custody of the children last year after a bitter court fight in which Foster accused him of being an absentee father. Foster renewed her arguments based on Monday's accident, contending the singer ""continues to excessively travel, utilizes third-party caregivers to supervise the minor children rather than personally exercising parenting time and providing supervision for the minor children."" Usher is ""not capable of providing daily caregiving and supervision for the minor children of the parties as petitioner is preparing to film a movie in Panama and has ongoing commitments that require his presence in Los Angeles, New York and various other cities for the Voice and his upcoming album."" Her motion alleges that Usher is away from Atlanta -- where she and the children live ""in excess of 85% of each month."" He refuses to let her see the children when he leaves towns, saying he ""would rather the nanny raise the children,"" Foster contends. Foster also complained that her ex-husband does not talk to her about issue affecting the boys, ""including school enrollment and summer activities."" The private school in which he just enrolled them is more than an hour from her home, she said. Usher has not given her the phone number to the home he moved to with the children in June, she said. ""As the result of the negligence and failure to properly supervise the minor child, U.R.,V, nearly drown in a swimming pool and is currently hospitalized in the intensive care unit of the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Hospital, undergoing treatment for the injuries sustained on August 5, 2013."" She blames the swimming accident on ""the negligence and failure to properly supervise"" the children. Usher's aunt was in charge of the children when the oldest son ""suffered a near-death accident while left unsupervised in a swimming pool,"" the motion contends. ""I need an ambulance,"" his aunt, Rena Oden, told an emergency operator in a call to 911. ""My nephew was in the pool, and I couldn't get him, I tried to get him."" A recording of the call was made public by police Tuesday. The aunt, housekeeper and another woman were ""unsuccessful in pulling the victim from the pool drain,"" but two men -- Eugene Stachurski and Ben Crews -- who were installing sound equipment in the home rushed to help, the report said. ""They're doing CPR on him now,"" Oden told the operator. ""Is he coming around? He's breathing!"" Stachurski, a sound technician, rescued the child from the drain and used CPR to revive him on the side of the pool, the police report said. About five minutes into the recording, Oden told the operator that paramedics had arrived at the home and had taken over. The child was ""conscious, alert and breathing"" when the ambulance took him to a hospital, where he was kept overnight for observation, the police report said.

"(CNN) -- Salads are off the menu for all American Airlines flights departing from Europe. In light of the recent E. coli strain scare, American Airlines is pulling ""green salads, lettuce and tomato garnishes"" to alleviate any concerns its passengers may have. ""We are replacing the salad menu items with other menu options to pre-empt any risk and alleviate concerns,"" reads an alert on the airline's website. ""We will closely monitor and take direction from the local health authorities and the World Health Organization and return to the original menu when we believe it is safe to do so,"" American Airlines said. Other airlines are monitoring the situation. Delta Air Lines has no plans to stop offering salads on flights out of Europe, but the airline is talking to European caterers daily, Delta spokeswoman Chris Kelly Singley said. Sixteen deaths have been linked with the outbreak: 15 in Germany and one in Sweden. According to the World Health Organization, more than 1,000 people in 10 countries have been sickened by the strain. Russia also announced Thursday that it would be banning any fresh vegetable imports from the European Union in an attempt to combat the deadly outbreak. Although the source is still unknown, the outbreak has been traced to cucumbers that were imported to Germany from Spain. Authorities are advising that people avoid raw cucumbers, tomatoes and lettuce in Germany and other European countries.","American Airlines has pulled vegetables from the menus of all flights leaving Europe .

"(CNN) -- On Sunday, a mystery photograph fluttered from the sky and landed near Leslie Hagelberg's mailbox in West Tulsa, Oklahoma. She soon discovered it had been blown from Shawnee, Oklahoma, some 90 miles away. More random items would rain from the heavens across eastern Oklahoma a day later, when the tornado that ripped through Shawnee was followed by a bigger one in nearby Moore. School pictures, personal letters, valentines and baseball cards -- all have been found in recent days many miles from their owners' homes. The items were sucked into the sky by the 200-mph winds that killed at least 24 people and left a path of destruction in their wake, then blown east across the Oklahoma plains by middle- and upper-atmospheric winds. Help tornado victims claim lost photos . Hagelberg said some items have been reported found as far as 250 miles away from where the tornadoes struck. Now, she and others are using Facebook to try to help victims of the deadly storms get at least some small pieces of their lives back. On Sunday, she created a Facebook group called ""May 19th 2013 OK Tornado Doc & Picture Recovery."" But when Moore was hit the next day, the group was soon overwhelmed, picking up more than 11,000 members. She and others have now made a public page, MAY 2013 Oklahoma Tornado Doc & Photo Recovery Page, where anyone can post or tag images and share them on their own pages. Theirs is one of several pages on Facebook where people are being asked to share photos of items they have found, along with contact information, for anyone who may be able to identify them. See some of the images of items found after the tornadoes . ""First, thank you all for the overwhelmingly generous response to our group,"" Hagelberg wrote Wednesday. ""The photos and documents are being posted, people are finding cherished treasures they have lost and we couldn't be more elated."" Hagelberg did not immediately respond to a message sent by CNN to her Facebook page Wednesday. But she told The Huffington Post the page is her small way of trying to boost recovery efforts in Shawnee and Moore. ""I'm just trying to help,"" she said. ""I couldn't imagine losing my kids' pictures."" Most of the items posted to the page are photographs: a Pee Wee league football game, prom pictures, kids playing and families posing at places like Sea World. But there are other personal belongings, too, from a teddy bear to a letterman's jacket to a pink birth-notice card from a hospital with the words ""I'm a Girl"" printed on top. Dozens of items had already been claimed by early this week, as residents began taking their first faltering steps toward recovery. ""This is a photo of my sister's husband's dad,"" a woman wrote beneath a photo dated 1967. ""Both (men) are now deceased. She lost her home in the Shawnee tornado. I will try to contact (her) via Facebook. God bless you for posting!"" The effort is similar to another on Facebook after 2011 storms that ripped through Alabama and other Southeastern states. ""I just started saying, 'There are parts of people's lives falling out of the sky,'"" Patty Bullion, that group's creator, told CNN at the time. ""You just know these are prized possessions to people. If they've lost everything and could just get one picture back, I know that would mean a lot to me."" Hagelberg is reminding anyone who posts to the page to remember not to show Social Security numbers, phone numbers or other personally identifying information.","Winds from the tornadoes that hit Oklahoma have scattered items hundreds of miles .

"(CNN) -- More than 50 years ago, military brass sat down the couple who'd become Susan Green's parents. They told them how horrible it would be if a black man and a white woman wed at a time when interracial marriage was illegal in parts of the United States. They did it anyway. Six years later, in 1967, they celebrated when the Supreme Court ruled in Loving v. Virginia that no state could stop different races from marrying. For years, Susan Green knew their anguish, their struggle, their determination. Today, she knows their joy. Green thought of her parents three years ago as she tearfully filled out a license to wed her partner Robin Phillips in Provincetown, Massachusetts. The seaside enclave was more than 2,500 miles away from their home state of Arizona, where same-sex marriage has been banned. She cried more tears of joy Wednesday, when the Supreme Court struck down part of the Defense of Marriage Act in ruling the federal government cannot treat legally married gay and lesbian couples differently from heterosexual ones. 'What about us?' ask couples who still can't marry . ""This must have been what Mom and Dad felt like when the Loving case was decided,"" Green said. ""It was the beginning, and it was the acknowledgment they had the right to marry, they had the right to be together."" Green and Phillips haven't kept secret the fact they're lesbians, or that they're together. They joke about being the only married couple on the faculty at Arizona State University's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication and are grateful for their colleagues support. It hasn't been easy, though. In November 2008, Arizona voters passed an amendment to the state constitution defining marriage as ""only a union of one man and one woman."" That meant -- as it does for others in 37 states where same-sex marriage is not or will soon not be legal -- Green and Phillips were, in legal terms, little more than roommates. Even after their Massachusetts nuptials, Green fought through health ailments and worried that if something happened to her, Phillips wouldn't get her Social Security benefits. ""As we start to get older and think about retirement and things like that, all of these issues come into play,"" Green said. What's next for gay rights? Wednesday ended up being a ""little crazy"" in the best possible way with laughter, tears and relief. They breathed easier not having to worry about things that they might have the day before. They rejoiced the federal government finally will recognize their union as valid. They celebrated that gay rights had come so far, and that they'd been around to see it happen and to talk to the world about it. ""This is a great thing,"" Phillips said. ""And it helps us share our stories."" They've been doing that at Arizona State for years, where Green said students she's never met regularly show up at her door, asking for help figuring out how to come out to their families and friends. Others come to them fearful of getting outed at work, and theoretically fired, given that most states still don't have laws that prohibit terminating someone because they are gay or transgendered. ""I'm out, and I'm there for them,"" Green said. ""... I serve in a lot of different ways."" Rulings hailed as historic . Having the chance to help people is one reason the pair wants to stay in Arizona. It may be easier to go elsewhere, to a state like New York or Washington, where there would be no questions about whether they'd get the same rights as heterosexual couples. Wednesday's Supreme Court ruling, notably, didn't mandate everyone recognize same-sex marriages: That's still up to the individual states. It doesn't change anything in Arizona, for instance. But Arizonans need to know that there are happy, productive same-sex couples in their midst, not for them all to go elsewhere, Green said. It's harder for them to be foreign or an unknown if they work down the hall, live down the block or shop at the same store. Besides, Green said, her parents didn't teach her to give up when they steadfastly insisted on getting married, whatever anyone else thought. ""Some states may be easier to live in,"" she said. ""But I can't let my mom and dad down."" CNN's Jen Christensen contributed to this report.","Susan Green's father was black, her mother was white when they married in 1961 .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Radioactive cesium has been found in baby formula in Japan following the nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, the manufacturer of the product has said. Meiji Co., the maker of the formula, said Tuesday that it had found traces of cesium 134 and cesium 137 in samples of its Step Milk powder with the expiration date of Oct. 2012, but that the levels would not be harmful to babies' health. The formula contained as much as 31 becquerels of cesium per kilogram, below the allowable limit of 200 becquerels per kilogram set by the government, Meiji said. A becquerel is a measurement of radioactive intensity. A spokesman for Meiji said the company would nonetheless offer free replacements of 400,000 cans of the product ""to relieve the anxieties of our customers."" Ingredients of the baby powder may have come into contact with airborne radioactive cesium when they were being dried at a factory in Kasukabe, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Tokyo, between March 14 and 20, the company said. The devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck the northeast coast of Japan on March 11 damaged nuclear reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, resulting in radiation leaks. Meiji accounts for about 40 percent of baby formula sales in Japan. It also exports the Step Milk formula to Vietnam under a different name, but says it examines the product before shipping. CNN's Junko Ogura contributed to this report.","The manufacturer says the radioactivity wouldn't be harmful babies' health .

"(CNN) -- Apple said Wednesday that it never provided identification numbers of iPhones and iPads to the FBI, after hackers claimed to have scored millions of them by breaking into an agent's laptop. ""The FBI has not requested this information from Apple, nor have we provided it to the FBI or any organization,"" Apple said in a statement to CNN. Hackers with AntiSec, one of the multitude of groups associated with Web activist movement Anonymous, posted online what they claimed are the IDs of more than 1 million iPhones and iPads. And they say that's just part of the more than 12 million IDs -- and other information such as users' names, cell phone numbers and billing addresses -- they got from the laptop of an FBI agent. Apple added that in its latest mobile operating system, iOS 6, Apple has replaced the types of identifiers the hackers appear to have gotten and will be discontinuing their use. Security experts have said that the IDs, posted on document-sharing site Pastebin, appear to be legitimate. A day earlier, the FBI denied the hackers' claim that they accessed the laptop of Christopher K. Stangl, a cybersecurity expert, by exploiting a vulnerability in programming language Java. ""At this time there is no evidence indicating that an FBI laptop was compromised or that the FBI either sought or obtained this data,"" the FBI said in a statement. The bureau's press office went further on its Twitter feed. ""Bottom line: TOTALLY FALSE,"" it wrote. Via the Twitter account that first posted a link to the documents, the hackers responded quickly Wednesday as word of Apple's statement began spreading. ""Apple: We Didn't Give FBI Any Device IDs. But who did? That's the 10000001$ question,"" read a post on the feed. The group says it released exactly 1,000,001 IDs of the more than 12 million it collected. In one of the story's more bizarre twists, the website Gawker posted a photo Wednesday of one of its reporters, Adrian Chen, wearing a ballet tutu with a tennis shoe on his head. In their Pastebin post, the hackers, in typically irreverent style, said they wouldn't be talking to the media about the hack unless Gawker posted such a photo of Chen, who sometimes writes critically of Anonymous. As of Wednesday afternoon, Chen said he had yet to hear from Anonymous.","Apple: We didn't give iPhone, iPad IDs to the FBI .

"(CNN) -- They were standing near the finish line, cheering the runners in the Boston Marathon. It was a beautiful, cool day when two bombs unleashed chaos and killed three people. Friends of those killed say they are devastated by the senseless deaths. Here is some of what we know about each of the victims: . Krystle Campbell, 29, Arlington, Massachusetts . ""She was the best,"" Campbell's distraught mother, Patty, told reporters on Tuesday. ""You couldn't ask for a better daughter."" The family is heartbroken and still in shock, Patty Campbell said as she tried to read a statement on the family's porch. Everyone loved Krystle, she said. ""She had a heart of gold. She was always smiling,"" Patty Campbell said as her son, Billy, clutched her with his right arm. Krystle's grandmother said the 29-year-old was a special kind of person who nurtured deep friendships. ""Oh, she was a beautiful girl,"" Lillian Campbell told CNN's Jake Tapper. ""She was very happy, outgoing, a hard worker."" Lillian Campbell said her granddaughter even lived with her for a year and a half and was ""great with me."" Her granddaughter was always willing to help someone in need, she said. ""And she was, she was just beautiful. She was a fun-loving girl,"" Campbell said. Krystle Campbell once worked at Summer Shack, a seafood restaurant in the Boston area that posted a statement on its Facebook page saying she was beloved. ""She was an incredible woman, always full of energy and hard at work, but never too tired to share her love and a smile with everyone,"" the post said. ""She was an inspiration to all of us. Please keep her and her family in your thoughts and prayers."" According to the Boston Globe, Campbell had taken a job with Jimmy's Steer House in Arlington. The Globe reported that Campbell often went to the see the marathon runners. ""She's been doing it since she was a little girl,"" Lillian Campbell told the newspaper. ""She didn't miss a marathon, watching it at the finish line."" Campbell was a 2001 graduate of Medford High School, the town's mayor, Michael McGlynn, said. CNN affiliate WHDH reported that the Campbells are longtime residents of Medford. Martin Richard, 8, Dorchester, Massachusetts . Like many young boys in New England, Martin Richard loved his Boston Red Sox and the Bruins. ""He wore his (Red Sox second baseman) Dustin Pedroia shirt to school last week,"" neighbor Bill Forry told CNN's Anderson Cooper. Martin was a terrific athlete, too, Forry said, but he was also a very good student who would help others who were having trouble with homework. ""A quiet kid, but a compassionate kid -- and somebody who was a leader,"" Forry said. Martin attended the Neighborhood House Charter School. He ""was a bright, energetic young boy who had big dreams and high hopes for his future,"" the school said in a statement. ""We are heartbroken by this loss."" His father, William Richard, released a statement asking people to ""continue to pray for my family as we remember Martin."" A neighbor, Jane Sherman, said that the Richard family is a ""typical all-American family"" and that Martin and his little brother always loved to play in their yard, no matter the weather. Richard's mother and sister are recovering from serious injuries sustained in the bombing, the father said. Another life ended: A Boston University grad student . While the name of the third victim killed by the blasts was not officially confirmed on Tuesday, Boston University said that the person was a graduate student at the school. ""The student was one of three friends who watched the race near the finish line,"" the university said on its website. ""Another of the three students, also a BU grad student, was injured and is in stable condition at Boston Medical Center."" The third person in the group was unharmed, the statement added. A short time later, China's consulate in New York announced that the deceased victim was a Chinese national. At the family's request, the consulate did not name her. According to a profile on LinkedIn, the woman was a graduate student in mathematics and statistics at Boston University who was due to get her master's degree in 2014. She graduated from a Chinese university with a degree in international economics, the professional networking site indicated. She'd also previously studied for a semester at the University of California at Riverside. Chinese students at Boston University respected her family's request for anonymity, with many of them forming a tight-knit group. One of them, former CNN intern Alex Shi, said that the students are deeply saddened. Many of the students feel affected because people were trying hard to locate those reported missing -- including the victim -- by calling hospitals and posting on social media.","Three people were killed when two homemade explosives went off at the Boston Marathon .

"Jakarta (CNN) -- Southeast Asia's top diplomat has warned that the South China Sea disputes risk becoming ""Asia's Palestine"", deteriorating into a violent conflict that draws sharp dividing lines between nations and destabilises the whole region. Surin Pitsuwan, the outgoing secretary-general of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, told the Financial Times that Asia was entering its ""most contentious"" period in recent years as a rising China stakes out its claim to almost the entire South China Sea, clashing with the Philippines, Vietnam and others. Read more: Does Norway hold the key to solving South China Sea dispute? ""We have to be mindful of the fact that the South China Sea could evolve into another Palestine,"" if countries do not try harder to defuse rather than inflame tensions, he said. As it has grown economically and militarily more powerful, Beijing has become more assertive about its territorial claims in the South China Sea, which encompasses vast oil and gas reserves, large fish stocks and key global trade routes. Interactive: Asia's disputed islands -- who claims what? After naval clashes with Vietnam and the Philippines -- which claim parts of the South China Sea alongside Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan -- China has further angered its neighbours by printing a map of its extensive maritime claim, known as the ""nine-dotted line"" in new passports. Vietnam has hit back by marking the passports of visiting Chinese as ""invalid"" and issuing separate visa forms rather than appearing to recognise the Chinese claim by stamping passports. Dangerous waters: Behind the islands dispute . The US state department on Tuesday said Washington would continue to accept the new Chinese passports as legal documents, adding that countries were free to decide what their passports looked like. But Victoria Nuland, the state department spokeswoman, added that it was a separate issue ""whether it's politically smart or helpful to be taking steps that antagonise countries"". The US has responded to a resurgent Beijing by refocusing its foreign policy on Asia and building closer strategic and military ties with old foes such as Myanmar and Vietnam, which also fear the consequences of potential Chinese hegemony in the region. Squeezed between these two great powers, southeast Asian nations will come under growing pressure to take sides unless they can stay united, said Mr Pitsuwan, a Thai diplomat who will step down next month after five years as the head of Asean. He argued that the deteriorating situation in the South China Sea was the result of ""the internal dynamics of China"", with Beijing focused on upholding its sovereignty and territory because of the recent leadership change, growing prosperity and a sense that the state-building process was still under way. Read more: Can both sides back off peacefully? Asean, which is the only high-level forum for security issues in Asia, has fallen into disarray this year as Cambodia, a close Beijing ally and the chairman of the organisation, has undermined efforts by the Philippines and Vietnam to form a consensus about how to respond to China's assertive stance. ""Cambodia has to balance itself within an increasingly tense power play,"" said Mr Pitsuwan. ""I think Cambodia did what it had to do -- you have to look at it from their perspective."" He added that the best hope for avoiding conflict was for Asean and China to agree on a binding code of conduct that would discourage nations from trying to seize islands, oilfields and fishing grounds in order to back up their territorial claims. But this would be challenging given that Asia's political institutions and dispute-resolution mechanisms were still very under-developed relative to the growing region's economic might.","Southeast Asia's top diplomat has warned that the South China Sea disputes risk becoming ""Asia's Palestine""

"Boston (CNN) -- After 30 days and 63 prosecution witnesses -- including extortion victims, shooting victims, federal law enforcement agents, former drug dealers, and families of alleged murder victims -- defense attorneys began making their case Monday for James ""Whitey"" Bulger, allegedly Boston's most feared underworld crime boss. Their first witness, a former FBI agent, testified that he was sent to clean up the ""leaks"" at the FBI in Boston in 1981, and that one of his assignments, given by the special agent in charge, was to evaluate Bulger as an informant and perform a ""suitability study."" After an evaluation, he recommended ""terminating"" Bulger as an informant. ""You have a guy telling you he is not an informant ... telling you he has his own gang ... he pays, they (the FBI) don't pay him,"" Robert Fitzpatrick, the former agent, said Monday. ""That automatically, in my opinion and according to the book, would nullify him as a trusted informant."" ""You may call him an informant by name. According to the bureau, according to the file, he is an informant,"" Fitzpatrick, who spent more than 20 years with the FBI, said before a federal jury in Boston on Monday. He ultimately recommended that Bulger's file be closed. On cross-examination, prosecution attorney Brian Kelly asked Fitzpatrick rhetorically, ""You wouldn't go to close a window if it wasn't open right?"" Much of Bulger's trial has been focused on whether he was an open informant for the FBI in Boston for two decades during the time prosecutors say he reigned over crime in South Boston, participating in 19 murders, racketeering, extortion and money laundering -- all of which he has been charged with. The prosecution previously introduced a 700-page document that suggests Bulger was an informant. That assertion has been the crux of the prosecution's case, which wrapped up Friday. The defense argues that Bulger had FBI agents on his payroll to protect him from wiretaps and indictments, but he never fed any information to the FBI. Defense attorney Hank Brennan's line of questioning indicated that Bulger's counsel is attempting to shift the pendulum, and put the FBI on trial for corruption. The defense called Fitzpatrick, 73, to testify about being called in 1981 to ""stop the leaking in Boston."" ""Inside and outside FBI,"" there was a ""leaking of information, causing lots of investigations to go south,"" Fitzpatrick said. He was assistant special agent in charge, head of the drug task force and white collar crime section of the FBI in Boston. Describing himself as a whistle-blower, he detailed instances when he tried to report leaks and corruption within the FBI in Boston. In one instance, Fitzpatrick testified, the FBI and government strike force attorneys were resisting his efforts to get an FBI informant into the witness protection program. ""I was getting the impression that people were stonewalling our trying to get Halloran out of harm's way,"" Fitzpatrick said Monday. Brian Halloran, one of Bulger's former associates, agreed to cooperate with the FBI and implicate Bulger in the murder of a wealthy Oklahoma businessman. Two days after Fitzpatrick complained to his superiors that not enough was being done to put the man in witness protection, Halloran was shot to death, along with a friend, Michael Donahue, who was driving him home. Bulger's ""surrogate son"" and former associate, Kevin Weeks, testified earlier in the trial that ""Jim Bulger just kept shooting,"" describing Halloran's writhing, bullet-ridden body as ""bouncing off the ground."" Bulger was tipped off by his rogue FBI informant handler that Halloran was cooperating with the FBI, according to testimony from disgraced FBI agents. Fitzpatrick contends he was ultimately forced to resign from his post in Boston because he was being retaliated against after reporting to headquarters that his boss was leaking information about grand jury testimony. ""The reason I left the FBI is because it was corrupt at that level,"" he said. On cross-examination, sparks flew as prosecuting attorney Brian Kelly asked Fitzpatrick immediately, ""It's fair to say you are a man who likes to make up stories?"" Kelly argued that in Fitzpatrick's memoir ""Betrayal,"" the former agent falsely proclaims that he made the arrest of a mafia crime boss. Kelly produced the FBI report in court that made no mention of Fitzpatrick's name in the arrest report. Fitzpatrick also contends in his book that he recovered the rifle used to shoot Martin Luther King Jr. Prosecutor Kelly brandished the 200-page report on the FBI's website documenting the MLK assassination, which does not make one mention of Fitzpatrick. ""Where's you?"" Kelly asked Fitzpatrick. ""I was on the scene when shot was taken,"" he said. Tension between attorneys is mounting as the trial gets into its final weeks. Kelly used words as ammunition as he read passages from Fitzpatrick's memoir amid a fiery line of questions. Bulger's attorney, J.W. Carney, had to reinforce his partner Hank Brennan's objections at one point, adding, ""Apparently it takes two voices to get Mr. Kelly to stop talking."" Kelly got Fitzpatrick to admit that he was not working in the FBI during the time the government began to make its case against Bulger, and said aloud to a very attentive jury, ""you have nothing to do with the charges that bring us here today."" Fitzpatrick is still in legal battles for his pension, which he lost as a result of being forced to resign five years early. On why he titled his book ""Betrayal,"" he said, ""I felt betrayed. ""I think the government felt betrayed. ""The FBI was betrayed. ""The Justice Department was betrayed. ""There was a lot of betrayal going on."" The defense plans to call at least 11 more witnesses, but the attorneys indicated that is subject to change. Also Monday, Judge Denise Casper heard arguments on a defense motion to sequester the jury. Kelly said that it was ""not necessary"" to suggest this to the jury ""at the 11th hour."" Carney replied that there has ""never been a more widely publicized or sensational case in this district,"" harkening to saturated media coverage and ""statements that are so hyperbolic and prejudicial towards the defendant ... unlike anything anyone has seen."" Casper has not yet ruled on the motion . Fitzpatrick said he met with Bulger only one time to evaluate him as an informant, and Bulger did not give him any valuable information. He added that the only information he ever gleaned from Bulger came from his FBI file, which was written by Bulger's rogue FBI informant handlers, John Morris and John Connolly. Connolly is serving time for leaking sensitive information that cost two cooperating witnesses their lives at Bulger's hands. Morris was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony in 1998 in which he confirmed FBI misconduct. Morris, who reviewed all informant matters at the time, drove Fitzpatrick to a meeting with Bulger in January of 1981. Fitzpatrick said Morris was ""pumping him (Bulger) up"" to Fitzpatrick, saying that Bulger was a ""great guy."" Morris previously testified he accepted more than $7,000 in cash and gifts from Bulger. Fitzpatrick said that when he met Bulger in a dark corridor in Quincy, Massachusetts, Bulger was wearing a baseball cap -- ""Boston of course"" -- and sunglasses. Bulger would not shake Fitzpatrick's hand, he said. ""That's not a really nice way to start a conversation."" ""Most informants are really trying to help,"" he said. ""They are trying to do the job. I didn't get that from him at first."" So Fitzpatrick asked him, ""What are you doing for me?"" During a 30-minute conversation, Fitzpatrick said, Bulger never once gave him any valuable information. ""Basically, he was not giving me info I was trying to get. ... He was not responsive to what I was out there to get."" Bulger ""said he was leader of the gang, top guy. That resonated with me because, you know in the FBI, you can't have the head of the gang as an informant, because then you are validating the gang, you are a part of the management, if you will,"" he said. Fitzpatrick said Bulger told him he would never testify, which is rare for an informant. ""At one point, he (Bulger) even said, 'I am not an informant.' At that point I made a mental reservation ... 'what am I doing here, what's going on here?'"" Then Fitzpatrick, who thought this was a private meeting, was ""shocked"" to see Connolly, Bulger's rogue FBI informant handler, who ""popped up"" out of nowhere at the meeting, which Fitzpatrick said he was not entitled to attend. Connolly served time on federal racketeering charges and is now in state prison serving 40 years on related murder charges stemming from his relationship with Bulger. He tipped off Bulger and his crew that an associate, Halloran, was cooperating with the FBI and implicating Bulger in the Oklahoma businessman's murder. Ultimately, Fitzpatrick recommended Bulger be closed as an informant. Fitzpatrick gave the information to the special agent in charge, who passed the recommendation on to Washington FBI headquarters. Headquarters determined that Bulger was too valuable to taking down the New England Mafia and decided to keep him open. Morris testified that he wrote a letter to headquarters to persuade them to keep Bulger on as an informant because of all the help he was giving the FBI in taking down the Italian mafia, La Cosa Nostra. The defense has argued that it was Bulger's partner and henchman Stephen Flemmi who was providing information about the mafia, and that the information was put in Bulger's file so that the FBI could preserve him as an informant. Fitzpatrick testified that the only information he received from Bulger was information he read in Bulger's informant file, produced by rogue agents Connolly and Morris. He said he never had any reason ""not to trust"" the agents he worked with.","A former FBI agent is the first witness for the defense .

"(CNN) -- Mitt Romney has taken many people by surprise by announcing that his vice presidential running mate will be Wisconsin Representative Paul Ryan. The decision excites many conservatives who have been calling on Romney to go big. They believe Ryan will inject some juice into a campaign they feel has been lackluster and put the focus on the policy differences between Romney and President Obama. The primary risk with Ryan, from what we currently know about him, is that his controversial budget plan and tough line on Medicare could energize liberals and alienate elderly voters in key states like Florida. He also lacks foreign policy expertise and has spent most of his career in the city that conservatives hate, Washington. In recent decades, the record of vice presidential running mates who have come right out of the House is not very good. The risk of making the wrong choice for vice president was highlighted in 2008 by Sen. John McCain's selection of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, a decision many believe helped torpedo the Republican nominee. Palin struggled before the media, appearing inexperienced and unprepared for the Oval Office. She also used aggressive conservative rhetoric that undercut McCain's appeal to independents. But for all the talk about what can go wrong with vice presidential nominations, it is important to remember how many of these picks have helped the ticket. Very often vice presidential running mates have proven to be excellent on the campaign trail. They have compensated for the weaknesses of the person at the top of the ticket, they have played the role of attack dog and they have complemented the presidential candidate's strengths. In 1952, Gen. Dwight Eisenhower was determined to remain above the partisan fray. He wanted a campaign that highlighted his military record as America was bogged down in a military stalemate in Korea. California Sen. Richard Nixon served as an effective attack dog, taking on Democrat Adlai Stevenson for being too weak in fighting communism, branding him ""Adlai the Appeaser"" and saying the kinds of things Eisenhower wanted to avoid saying himself. Although a scandal involving a contribution fund Nixon maintained as senator almost caused him to be dumped from the ticket, Nixon turned the table on Democrats by going on television and delivering the famous ""Checkers Speech,"" in which he turned public sympathy in his favor. After hearing the speech, Eisenhower met with Nixon and said, ""Dick, you're my boy."" A few years later, Nixon fell victim to a good vice presidential pick when he ran for president against John F. Kennedy in 1960. Though he was disliked by many liberals, former Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson gave the Democrats strong appeal in Southern states and also helped bring an impressive level of Washington expertise to the ticket. In 1968, Nixon picked Maryland Gov. Spiro Agnew, who certainly brought his fair share of problems. Agnew was mocked by his opponents as a little known politician and uttered his share of gaffes as well as ethnic slurs. Yet Agnew did contribute to Nixon's victory by simultaneously appealing to the center, given his moderate record as governor in most policy areas, and to Southerners, given his increasingly hard line on racial issues such as school busing and law and order. Like Nixon in 1952, Agnew served as the attack dog and allowed Nixon, who had remade himself from an avid Cold Warrior into a foreign policy expert, to maintain his new image. In 1976, Minnesota Sen. Walter Mondale appealed to traditional Democrats such as organized labor and African-Americans who were distrustful of Jimmy Carter, an unknown Southerner who did not seem sympathetic to the party's core ideas. When Carter ran against Ronald Reagan in 1980, George H.W. Bush gave the GOP ticket immense foreign policy expertise and Washington experience that helped Reagan push back against criticism that he was just a lightweight Hollywood actor who would be unable to function in the corridors of Washington. Tennessee Sen. Al Gore proved to be a pitch-perfect running mate for Bill Clinton in 1992. Clinton wanted to convey the impression that Democrats were no longer the old ""tax and spend"" party Republicans had enjoyed attacking. Clinton was a Southerner and part of a new generation of Democrats. Gore, a hawkish centrist who agreed with Clinton, complemented the party message. Together, Clinton and Gore counteracted the ability of President Bush, and then in 1996 Sen. Bob Dole, to draw on the familiar campaign themes of the GOP. Simply the image of the two youthful men and their families generated excitement among voters. In 2000, George W. Bush surprised many observers when he picked former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, who was heading the vice presidential selection process, as his running mate. Cheney didn't do much on the campaign trail, but he did provide a record of deep experience in Washington that counteracted Democratic charges that Bush was a novice who lacked any gravitas. In 2004, Cheney would eviscerate Sen. John Kerry's running mate, Sen. John Edwards, during a debate that made the Democrat look too young and too inexperienced. In 2008, Sen. Barack Obama, who already had the wind to his back, took something of a risk with Sen. Joe Biden, who was notorious for his off the cuff remarks and gaffes. But Biden added value to the ticket, compensating for Obama's perceived inexperience and proving willing to engage in tough partisan attacks that Obama shied away from. It is possible that Ryan could help Mitt Romney in the coming months ---- and he could use a boost, since he's 7 points behind Obama in the latest CNN poll. If Ryan's main role is to be the ideological messenger of the campaign or to become the main attraction, he probably will not be effective. Based on the history, and the limited assistance vice presidential candidates can provide, what Romney needs is for Ryan to strengthen his central message, namely that he has more economic expertise than President Obama, to convince right-wing as well as Rust Belt Republicans that Romney would be a good president and to be able to engage in the kinds of tougher attacks that conservatives are clamoring for, the kinds of attacks Vice President Biden has proven quite adept at handling for Democrats. Anything more probably won't work, anything less will be a bust.

"(CNN) -- Hip hop star Snoop Dogg faces a drug charge after border agents searched his tour bus along the same stretch of a west Texas highway where singer Willie Nelson was busted in 2010, a Texas sheriff said. Snoop Dogg, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, ""freely admitted"" that three prescription bottles filled with marijuana cigarettes were his, a statement from the Hudspeth County, Texas, Sheriff said. The entertainer's representatives did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. The rapper, like Nelson, is an outspoken proponent of pot and he is known to have a license to use prescription medical marijuana in California. The bust happened early Saturday at his bus approached the U.S. Border Patrol Checkpoint located in Sierra Blanca, Texas, at the U.S.-Mexico border about 85 miles southeast of El Paso, the sheriff's statment said. ""During a routine check of U.S. citizenship the inspecting Border Patrol agent detected the odor of marijuana emitting from the inside of the vehicle and requested the driver to pull into the secondary inspection lane for further inspection,"" the statement said. A drug-detection dog sniffing inside the bus ""alerted to a trash can located at the rear of the vehicle where a red prescription bottle containing rolled marijuana cigarettes were located,"" the statement said. Two other containers with marijuana, weighing in all total of 0.130 pounds, were also found, it said. ""Snoop Dogg freely admitted that the marijuana belonged to him and he was placed under arrest by U.S. Border Patrol agents and detained,"" it said. He was cited for possession of drug paraphernalia, given a court date of January 20 and released, the sheriff said. Willie Nelson settled his November 2010 Hudspeth County pot bust with a plea deal that reduced his marijuana possession charge to possession of drug paraphernalia and imposed a $500 fine. The west Texas prosecutor who handled Nelson's case had suggested Nelson, a treasured icon in the Lone Star state, could pay just a $100 fine if he'd serenade the court with his 1975 hit ""Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain."" The judge quickly vetoed that offer. ""You can bet your ass I'm not going to be mean to Willie Nelson,"" Hudspeth County Attorney C.R. ""Kit"" Bramblett told CNN at the time. Bramblett was in court Monday and unavailable to comment on how he might handle Snoop Dogg's prosecution.

"(CNN) -- A spate of deadly shootings during anti-drug operations in Honduras -- including two in which U.S. agents killed suspects -- is linked to an aggressive new strategy to disrupt a preferred corridor for traffickers. Operation Anvil, as the multinational mission is known, differs from past efforts because of its reliance on military outposts close to the front lines to provide quick responses. It is a strategy reminiscent of counterinsurgency tactics used by the U.S. military on battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan. In a two-month span, six people have been killed in the operation, including possibly four innocent civilians. Despite the controversial shootings, American and Honduran officials say they both are happy with their collaboration and consider Operation Anvil -- launched in April -- a success. As of Wednesday, authorities said, they had interdicted five planes, seized about 2,300 kilos of cocaine, and made seven arrests. Firearms, including military assault rifles, have also been seized. ""The amount of drugs seized and the disruption of narcotrafficking routes speak for themselves,"" said Jorge Ramon Hernandez Alcerro, the Honduran ambassador to the United States. Meanwhile, critics in Honduras and the United States oppose the law enforcement strategy and question why American agents are killing anyone on foreign soil during peacetime. The latest incident was just after midnight on July 3, when a plane carrying 900 kilograms of cocaine crashed in northeast Honduras -- not an uncommon occurrence in a region that is among traffickers' preferred smuggling stopovers. Authorities descended on the scene, and when one of the suspected traffickers aboard the plane allegedly made a threatening move, two Drug Enforcement Agency officers opened fire, agency spokeswoman Barbara Carreno said. The suspect later died. It was the second such incident in a two-week span. On June 23, a DEA agent shot and killed a suspected trafficker after he reached for a weapon, the agency said. The pair of shootings by DEA agents follow an episode in May in which villagers in the country's Mosquitia coastal region say Honduran forces aboard American helicopters mistakenly fired on a civilian riverboat, killing four, including two pregnant women. A U.S. official with knowledge of the incident said that the preliminary Honduran investigation, as well as a video of the incident, raises doubts about claims by those on the riverboat that they were innocent victims. The official asked not to be named because the a final report has not been issued. ""I think this is a disheartening sign of the escalation of U.S. involvement in Honduras without clear goals and guidelines,"" said Dana Frank, a Honduras expert and history professor at the University of California Santa Cruz. ""There is no clear oversight from Congress over what is going on,"" she said. ""It's not clear under what terms the DEA is there, operating in killings."" Anti-narcotics cooperation between the United States and Central American countries is not new, but Anvil represents a new approach to intercepting smugglers' aircraft. Oliver Stone film revolves around drug war . Anvil's major innovation is the use of military outposts closer to the drug trafficking routes, known as forward operating locations, for quicker deployment by Honduran police and their DEA advisers. Anvil appears modeled after counterinsurgency tactics used by the United States in Afghanistan and Iraq, but the Hondurans say the suggestion to use the forward operating locations came from them. About 600 American troops are located in Honduras, mostly at Soto Cano Air Base. Officials say they have seen a decreased role in Operation Anvil as the DEA team has stepped up, but a limited number of U.S. troops remain at the forward operating locations. Joint Task Force Bravo, as the U.S. contingent is called, serves ""purely as a support element, providing re-fueling capability, communications infrastructure and medical evacuation capability"" at the forward bases, said Lt. Christopher Diaz, the spokesman for the group. The forward operating bases are owned and maintained by the Hondurans, and they have operated them for years, Diaz said. The helicopters used in the operations belong to the U.S. State Department, and are piloted either by Guatemalan military pilots who are on loan, or by U.S. contractors, said Stephen Posivak, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Honduras. What's not new is the teamwork between the DEA and vetted Honduran police who participate in the operations, Posivak said. ""This concept is new, but previously there's been these type of bi-national efforts done by the Honduran government and DEA,"" he said. Operation Anvil seeks to track planes entering Honduras, ascertains where they will land, and then sends helicopters out to make arrests, Posivak said. Both governments insist that the DEA agents provide a supporting role only, and that under their rules of engagement are allowed to fire their weapons only in response to a threat. The DEA ""is in Honduras at the request of our government in a support and training capacity,"" Hernandez said. The three shooting incidents are the part of Operation Anvil that has received the most attention, but law enforcement aid is just one of the facets of American help. Anvil falls within the larger framework of Central American Regional Security Initiative, or CARSI, which has provided more than half a billion dollars to the region since 2008. Besides law enforcement efforts, the money goes toward institution building and anti-corruption efforts, Posivak said. Nobelists focus on violence against women in Central America . ""It's not a problem that can be solved by law enforcement alone,"" he said. The goal is to address security concerns through all means, he said. U.S. funding for CARSI has increased from $60 million in 2008 to an estimated $135 million in 2012. The most controversial of the Anvil-related confrontations has been the May 11 incident near Ahuas in the Mosquitia region. Hilda Lezama, the owner of the boat that was attacked, told reporters last month that she was carrying passengers before dawn when helicopters appeared and opened fire, wounding her and killing four. The State Department, however, has indicated that the Honduran forces were justified in firing in self-defense. DEA agents were present, but did not fire their weapons, officials say. The Honduran government is investigating the incident, but critics don't believe the government has the capacity to fairly assess itself. ""What happened in Ahuas is unbelievable. They claim they combat crime but they cover up their own crime?"" said Rodolfo Pastor Fasquelle, a Honduran historian and former minister of culture, arts and sports. Pastor is one of 40 Honduran scholars, joined by 300 from outside the country, who signed a letter to President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asking that the United States cease all military and police aid until corrupt agencies are cleaned up. For the Americans, ""the collateral damages are related to an equation that supposes that the high price paid to keep drugs from reaching its market is in some way beneficial and worth it. For us who gain no benefit, these costs are unacceptable,"" Pastor said. They wrote the letter, he said, because Hondurans are ""fearful of the prospect of militarization without end."" Hernandez, the Honduran ambassador, counters that Operation Anvil and other programs are not military operations, but law enforcement ones. ""These are crime-fighting operations and, as such, entail serious risks for people involved in illicit activities and for the law enforcement agents on the field,"" Hernandez said. ""The DEA agents have followed their own rules of engagement and have used arms only when their lives have been threatened. Any loss of life is regrettable; the security authorities of Honduras have repeatedly alerted the local population of the dangers they incur by participating in this criminal activity."" Given the lack of control by Honduran authorities in the northeastern part of the country, it was inevitable that the United States would play a more direct role in combating drug trafficking there, said Mark Ungar, a professor of political science and criminal justice at Brooklyn College who has studied and worked in Honduras. Drug cartels exert such influence in the region that both law enforcement and civilian government agencies have been corrupted, he said. The corruption is entrenched, with local police, aeronautic agencies, rural logging interests and indigenous groups infiltrated by the cartels. Just as part of the counterinsurgency missions in Afghanistan and Iraq had an element of earning locals' trust, the same is needed in Honduras, Ungar said. ""It's not just a matter of seizing planes and catching people in the act, but a matter of gaining trust and understanding how these organizations work,"" he said. Drug trafficking through this corridor is not likely to stop until there is an understanding of how deeply entrenched the drug trade is in local communities, he added . But the Honduran government is weak, its institutions and police suffer from corruption, and public opinion favors security on the streets more than security in remote parts of the country, Ungar said. These factors are not favorable for long-term success, he said. Posivak, the U.S. embassy spokesman, said Operation Anvil has already proven successful at disrupting criminal organizations. ""We believe these interdictions have had a strong impact,"" he said. Why the U.S. can't afford to ignore Latin America .

"(CNN) -- Answers remain in short supply as to why an unarmed teenager was shot and killed two weeks ago. Trayvon Martin, 17, was walking toward the home of his father's fiancee in a gated community in Sanford, Florida, around sunset on February 26. The neighborhood watch captain, 28-year-old George Zimmerman, saw the teen on the property and called 911. According to CNN affiliate WFTV, Zimmerman, who is white, described Martin to a dispatcher as a suspicious black man. Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee said the 911 dispatcher told Zimmerman not to confront Martin, but by the time police arrived, the teenager lay dead with a gunshot wound in the chest. He was carrying a small amount of cash, some candy and an iced tea. Zimmerman told police he shot Martin in self-defense, but that doesn't sit well with Martin's parents. ""When you add it up, it just doesn't even make sense,"" said Ben Crump, the Martin family's attorney. ""Trayvon Martin, a kid, has a bag of Skittles. (Zimmerman) had a 9 mm gun. Trayvon Martin didn't approach George Zimmerman, George Zimmerman approached Trayvon Martin. So how can he now assert self-defense?"" Police say a gunshot can be heard on the 911 calls recorded that night. Sanford police said Monday the calls will not be made public until the investigation is complete, but the Martin family is pushing for the tapes to be released sooner. ""It will tell us why (Zimmerman) just disregarded, just ignored the police instructions when they tell him to stay put, they'll be there in a few minutes. On those 911 tapes is going to tell you why he said he's not going to follow their instructions. And most importantly, it's going to tell us his mentality when he confronted this 17-year-old kid,"" Crump said. Numerous attempts to contact Zimmerman by CNN were unsuccessful, and it is unclear whether Zimmerman has retained an attorney. Under intense pressure from the community, city officials in Sanford held a press conference on Monday. ""We are going to complete a thorough and fair investigation and present all the information to the state attorney's office so justice can be rendered,"" Lee said. Police said they have not charged Zimmerman because there are no grounds to disprove his story of what happened. ""The evidence and testimony we have so far does not establish that Mr. Zimmerman did not act in self-defense. We don't have anything to dispute his claim of self-defense, at this point, with the evidence and testimony that we have,"" Lee said. Lee said the directions the 911 dispatcher gave Zimmerman to not accost Martin when the incident arose were not mandatory instructions. ""That is a call taker making a recommendation to him. He's not under a legal obligation to do that, so that is not something we can charge him with. But it would have been a good outcome ... if Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman never came in contact with one another."" Tensions are swelling in the black community over why Zimmerman is free. ""You've got a little dead black boy, and the community sees you protecting the shooter,"" one man said. An outraged woman said, ""I'm sure you've heard the phrase, taking candy from a baby? But this person, I'm talking about every child, not just Trayvon Martin, whether he's black, white, blue, yellow or green, it is easy to take a candy from a baby. It's been said over and over and over again, but this person didn't take the candy, he took the life and left the child."" Sanford City Manager Norton Bonaparte said he had personally extended condolences to the Martin family. ""We see this as a tragedy. We are doing a full and thorough investigation, and certainly the guilty parties ... will be punished.""","Trayvon Martin, 17, was walking to a home in a gated community .

"(CNN) -- Weather experts agree: When lightning strikes, it's best to go indoors. But that advice didn't work for two women in the same Louisiana city who were hurt in lightning incidents about three weeks apart -- one in a grocery store and another in her home. On Monday, 33-year-old Lakeisha Brooks and her two children took shelter from a storm at a grocery store in Houma, Louisiana. Brooks said she was driving when the storm got severe so she decided to stop off and get some shopping done until it passed. While checking out her items she heard the thunder getting louder above her, when suddenly she felt a jolt of pain ricochet through her body. She realized it was lightning when she saw flashes, she said. ""I just felt this pain go right through me,"" Brooks said. ""It happened in a blink of an eye."" The lightning strike caused her right shoe to fly off, leaving a black imprint on her foot where the straps had been. The tile beneath her shattered, leaving blisters on her leg and feet. The store's assistant manager, Gene Moore, saw the incident. He said the current may have come through the store's fire sprinkler system. ""The lightning knocked off the sprinkler system on the roof,"" said Moore. ""The crackle was so loud. She was stunned."" Houma Police Chief Todd Duplantis says he has never heard of anything like this happening before. ""I've been with the police department for 28 years. I've never responded to a victim struck by lightning (indoors). I've heard of it on the outside, people walking outside, but I've never heard of anyone being struck by lightning while grocery shopping,"" he told CNN affiliate WWL. It wasn't a first in Houma, a city of 34,000 about 50 miles southwest of New Orleans. About three weeks earlier, some two miles from the store where Brooks was hurt, another lightning strike hit Mona Billiot while she was cooking dinner in her kitchen. ""I tried to dodge it,"" said Billiot. ""I was dazed, confused. I felt hot. My heart raced."" In 2012, lightning strikes caused 28 deaths and 139 injuries in the United States, according to the National Weather Service. CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta said strikes are becoming increasingly more common. ""One in 3,000 people has a chance of being hit by lightning (in a lifetime). Thankfully, very few people die, but it happens a lot more than people realize,"" he said. Doctors ran tests on both Brooks and Billiot and say they will be OK. ""I'm just getting to the realization that this happened,"" Brooks said. ""It's taken a toll on me. Each day is a new feeling."" Billiot credits God for her survival and said that, despite the pain, she could not help but appreciate lightning's beauty. ""It's really pretty -- the middle of a lightning bolt,"" she said. ""It's a shimmery, bright blue -- so bright it blinds you.""","Two women were two miles apart when lightning struck three weeks apart .

"(CNN) -- A list of 22 techniques for evading drone strikes shows that militants are trying to share their knowledge and reduce the number of casualties that American attacks are costing them. The tipsheet advises militants to hide under thick trees, stay in the shadows, cover up their vehicles, stay away from their parked cars, hold meetings indoors, and avoid using cell phones. If they hear a drone approaching, they are advised to scatter in multiple directions. The list also suggests using jamming equipment, and even setting up dummies as decoys to fool the reconnaissance planes. The Associated Press reported finding a printout of the tipsheet in the African nation of Mali, in the aftermath of recent fighting that pushed back militants there. But the list has been on the Internet www.as-ansar.com/vb/showthread.php?t=41604 for the last couple of years, according to terrorism analyst Jarret Brachman. Retired Col. Cedric Leighton, a former Air Force intelligence officer who worked on developing the American drone program, said he believes the evasive tactics that militants are attempting to adopt will not tip the balance in their favor. ""They are good for people who are in a desert environment, who are trying to avoid drones -- but there are a lot of limitations to them. The drones are fairly effective,"" he said. The list, according to CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank, demonstrates how concerned jihadists are about the toll that the strikes are taking on their ranks. ""It's a matter of life or death for them,"" he said. ""It has induced a high degree of paranoia in their ranks. That has made it more difficult for them to recruit new members."" Judging by interrogation reports and accounts of Westerners, said Cruickshank, ""it is extremely stressful, to know that any moment, the droning sound you hear from the sky may well be your death."" Al Qaeda's new strategy revealed . Before he was killed, Osama bin Laden himself warned his followers to take precautions against drone strikes, according to documents seized during the raid on his Pakistan compound . ""A warning to the brothers: they should not meet on the road and move in their cars because many of them got targeted while they were meeting on the road,"" bin Laden wrote. His advice to any militant who was on the move: ""He should move only when the clouds are heavy."" Leighton sees the tipsheet as an opportunity to learn how to foil the militants, since they have now tipped their hand. ""They're making it possible to see what their tactics are, and making it possible for us to develop tactics of our own to go against them,"" he said. It is unclear how many people have been killed by American drone strikes around the world, but Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-South Carolina, told an audience Tuesday that it is in the neighborhood of 4,700 people. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism gives a similar estimate. CNN terrorism expert Peter Bergen says that over the course of around 420 drone strikes, some 250 to 370 civilians likely have been killed (plus 200 to 330 unknowns). The strikes have caused public resentment in targeted countries like Pakistan and Yemen.

"(CNN) -- The FBI and the CIA are being criticized for not keeping better track of Tamerlan Tsarnaev in the months before the Boston Marathon bombings. How could they have ignored such a dangerous person? How do we reform the intelligence community to ensure this kind of failure doesn't happen again? It's an old song by now, one we heard after the 9/11 attacks in 2001 and after the Underwear Bomber's failed attack in 2009. The problem is that connecting the dots is a bad metaphor, and focusing on it makes us more likely to implement useless reforms. Connecting the dots in a coloring book is easy and fun. They're right there on the page, and they're all numbered. All you have to do is move your pencil from one dot to the next, and when you're done, you've drawn a sailboat. Or a tiger. It's so simple that 5-year-olds can do it. But in real life, the dots can only be numbered after the fact. With the benefit of hindsight, it's easy to draw lines from a Russian request for information to a foreign visit to some other piece of information that might have been collected. Opinion: Agencies often miss warning signs of attacks . In hindsight, we know who the bad guys are. Before the fact, there are an enormous number of potential bad guys. How many? We don't know. But we know that the no-fly list had 21,000 people on it last year. The Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, also known as the watch list, has 700,000 names on it. We have no idea how many potential ""dots"" the FBI, CIA, NSA and other agencies collect, but it's easily in the millions. It's easy to work backwards through the data and see all the obvious warning signs. But before a terrorist attack, when there are millions of dots -- some important but the vast majority unimportant -- uncovering plots is a lot harder. Rather than thinking of intelligence as a simple connect-the-dots picture, think of it as a million unnumbered pictures superimposed on top of each other. Or a random-dot stereogram. Is it a sailboat, a puppy, two guys with pressure-cooker bombs or just an unintelligible mess of dots? You try to figure it out. It's not a matter of not enough data, either. Piling more data onto the mix makes it harder, not easier. The best way to think of it is a needle-in-a-haystack problem; the last thing you want to do is increase the amount of hay you have to search through. The television show ""Person of Interest"" is fiction, not fact. There's a name for this sort of logical fallacy: hindsight bias. First explained by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, it's surprisingly common. Since what actually happened is so obvious once it happens, we overestimate how obvious it was before it happened. We actually misremember what we once thought, believing that we knew all along that what happened would happen. It's a surprisingly strong tendency, one that has been observed in countless laboratory experiments and real-world examples of behavior. And it's what all the post-Boston-Marathon bombing dot-connectors are doing. Before we start blaming agencies for failing to stop the Boston bombers, and before we push ""intelligence reforms"" that will shred civil liberties without making us any safer, we need to stop seeing the past as a bunch of obvious dots that need connecting. Kahneman, a Nobel prize winner, wisely noted: ""Actions that seemed prudent in foresight can look irresponsibly negligent in hindsight."" Kahneman calls it ""the illusion of understanding,"" explaining that the past is only so understandable because we have cast it as simple inevitable stories and leave out the rest. Nassim Taleb, an expert on risk engineering, calls this tendency the ""narrative fallacy."" We humans are natural storytellers, and the world of stories is much more tidy, predictable and coherent than the real world. Millions of people behave strangely enough to warrant the FBI's notice, and almost all of them are harmless. It is simply not possible to find every plot beforehand, especially when the perpetrators act alone and on impulse. We have to accept that there always will be a risk of terrorism, and that when the occasional plot succeeds, it's not necessarily because our law enforcement systems have failed. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bruce Schneier.","FBI, CIA criticized for not keeping better track of Tamerlan Tsarnaev before attack .

Sub-zero soaks are commonplace from Scotland to Siberia as swimmers, often fortified by a shot of booze, shiver themselves bluer than the cast of Avatar. Why you should: An invigorating icy swim will wash away last year's cobwebs. Why you shouldn't: It could also wash away frozen parts of your body. Underwear . After exposing your extremities to such a chilly experience it might be wise to have some thermals to hand, but sensible unmentionables aren't on our list. Instead, like partygoers in Italy and some South American countries you should be thinking about a more dazzling set of drawers. In Italy, Spain and South and Central America, color-coded underpants take on special meaning at New Year with red or yellow auguring luck or romance. Why you should: It's a chance to liven up your lingerie. Why you shouldn't: With all this talk about pants and love you'll need another icy dip. German sense of humor . If you're fed up with unfunny jokes told by drunken party guests, it's time to tap into Germany's love of deadpan absurdism. Almost every New Year's Eve for the past half a century, German television has broadcast ""Dinner for One,"" a comic English play in which a sozzled butler imitates party guests to humor his elderly employer. The annual repeat of the show's catchphrase: ""The same procedure as last year,"" adds to the hilarity and has helped it earn fans in several neighboring countries. Why you should: The show's saucy punchline is well worth it . Why you shouldn't: The joke takes about 50 years to work properly . Broken television set . When endless reruns of ""Dinner for One"" result in frustration being taken out on your TV, you might be tempted to throw it out of the window in line with a now extinct Italian New Year tradition of defenestrating unwanted goods. A similar habit in South Africa has seen fridges and other household objects ejected from up high, sometimes resulting in injury and arrest. Why you should: You shouldn't. Why you shouldn't: It's illegal, not to mention dangerous. Grapes . There's nothing too unusual about serving grapes at a party -- unless you follow the traditions of Mexico, Chile and Costa Rica where 12 grapes are consumed on New Year's Eve, each a symbol of the months that lie ahead. In Spain the grapes must be eaten in time with the 12 chimes of midnight, which can turn the traditional New Year's kiss into a messy business. Why you should: Grapes are a tasty source of anti-oxidants and vitamins. Why you shouldn't: Inhaling grapes = Heimlich Maneuver. Molten lead . Back to Germany for another unusual ritual in which a spoonful of lead is melted over a candle then dropped into a bucket of water. The shapes formed by the cooling metal are then divined for signs of what lies in the year ahead. Certain formations have specific meanings: An egg signifies a growing family, a clover means luck and a hat shape means good news. No one takes it seriously. Why you should: It's fun. Why you shouldn't: It's nonsense. Pigs . In the Swiss ski resort of Klosters, the first day of January is celebrated with a piglet race in which 10 tiny porkers sprint through the snow for the enviable prize of being spared from the sausage factory. The winner is usually adopted as a town mascot for the year. Why you should: Piglets! So cute! Why you shouldn't: The losers get eaten. Chairs . Chairs at a party aren't exactly a radical innovation, but in Denmark they are typically used as a launching pad for people who believe that by leaping into the New Year they will banish malevolent spirits. Why you should: You can claim your new year exercise regime has started early. Why you shouldn't: You'll need the icy water again to bathe those twisted ankles. Dead birds . Sailors love a good party, but are notoriously superstitious souls, believing that it is unlucky to begin a voyage on December 31. Maritime lore also suggests that feathers plucked from a wren slain on New Year's Day can protect seafarers from dying in a shipwreck. Why you should: You polished off those piglets, so a wren isn't going to hurt your conscience. Why you shouldn't: Nothing kills a party like a dead bird. Bed . Britain has a certain reputation when it comes to New Year's Eve, particularly in Scotland where Hogmanay celebrations -- climaxing in a rendition of the traditional Scottish song ""Auld Lang Syne"" -- can border on the bacchanalian. So it is perhaps a surprise to discover that, according to a survey conducted last year, over a third of Britons prefer to be tucked up in bed on the stroke of midnight. Why you should: You'll avoid the most overrated party of the year. Why you shouldn't: Champagne corks, fireworks and ABBA will keep you awake anyway.","Bizarre New Year traditions include swimming in subzero seas .

"(CNN) -- For some it was an exhilarating holiday to an exotic place, finding new love or conquering their greatest fear. For others, it was witnessing an historic event. And for a few, it was simply a case of being in the right place at the right time to capture a moment that will forever stick in the mind. CNN asked people from all over the world to send in their highlight of the year. From the Philippines, to Scotland, to South Africa, hundreds of people shared their most treasured images. 2012 was the year the Olympics games came to London, and, unsurprisingly, many people sent in their images of the various competitions held around the capital. Gaya Ilang, who works as the artist Gaya3in1, was lucky enough to participate in the Games' spectacular opening ceremony -- playing a nurse. She sent in an image of proud participants posing eagerly just before they took part in the ceremony. ""I like this [image] as it has performers from different categories -- a snapshot of the ceremony -- and reminds me of the excitement of the day, clearly visible on everyone's faces,"" she said. Sport of a non-Olympic kind captured the imagination of Jamie McCaffrey from Ottawa, Canada. He submitted this lively image of soldiers from the Lake Superior Scottish Regiment of the Canadian Army Reserves competing in the tug of war at the annual Glengarry Highland Games in Maxville Ontario. ""The sight of these soldiers in a brutal test of raw strength while combined with the skirl of the pipes, the colors and flash of the different tartans on the kilts, and the cheer of the crowd was a feast for the eyes and ears,"" he said. ""Although, I understand that the music of the bagpipes may not be for everyone -- subtle it is not,"" he added. From the bombast of organized games to the quiet joy of a proud parent, many people chose their children as the source of their best moments of 2012. Charlotte Brocker from Berlin, Germany, captured a wonderful image of her son Malik wearing his Ramones t-shirt on a bike ride in August. Malik was born with clubbed feet and a physical condition called Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenitas, which means he has little muscle strength in his limbs. His mother took the photo in August after casts set on Malik's legs to strengthen them had been taken off. ""My cheerful and determined young man helped me to realize what matters in life and what doesn't,"" she said. ""Malik is a very happy, easy going young man, not much can hold him back, not even being stuck in casts. I also love how he's rocking that t-shirt!"" For some, 2012 was the year not just of striking out on to new journeys, but of returning home. Jessica Munoz from California, U.S., was thrilled to be reunited with her soldier husband on his return from Afghanistan. The poignant moment when she was reunited with her husband was captured by her friend, Libby Lugo. ""My friend literally grabbed the camera out of my hands and pushed me in the right direction [to her husband],"" she said. ""All the stress and fear and pain suddenly were replaced with love and magic and joy. I felt like I had gotten something precious back that was taken from me."" And sometimes it was images even closer to home that made for the best moments of the year. Even right outside the window. Abdel Hamid Zein took these beautiful, surreal images from the window of his 50th floor apartment in Dubai. ""It is foggy in Dubai on rare occasions and usually lasts for two to three hours in the morning,"" he said. ""It was quite impressive, because it's not everyday you wake up and you find yourself above the clouds."" And of course what year would be complete without at least one ambition being realised? For Julie Fox, a trip to Elvas, Portugal to ride a balloon at the International Hot Air Balloon Festival provided the chance to tick one dream off her life list -- particularly when she found out the rides were free. ""I'd always had a romantic image of hot air ballooning over the Serengeti or somewhere like that but have never been able to afford it,"" she said. ""The whole experience: Inflation, take off, the quiet contemplation of the countryside and the aerial views, wondering where we would land and the fun of packing up the balloon before driving back to the launch site is something that will stay with me forever.""","CNN asked people from all over the world to send in their best moments of 2012 .

"Washington (CNN) -- A top Republican leader agreed Thursday with President Barack Obama and Democrats that extending the payroll tax cut would help the economy, but the parties remained divided over how to pay for the move. Later Thursday, the Senate blocked competing Democratic and Republican proposals from moving forward, setting up negotiations on a possible compromise. The Democratic plan to extend and expand the payroll tax cut set to expire at the end of the year would assess a 3.25% tax on income over $1 million to pay the cost of more than $200 billion for the extension. Taxpayers with an income of $50,000 would benefit by $1,500 a year. Senate Republicans prevented Democrats from getting the 60 votes needed to proceed on the measure, which was blocked on a 51-49 vote. President Barack Obama quickly blamed Republicans, saying in a statement that they ""chose to raise taxes on nearly 160 million hardworking Americans because they refused to ask a few hundred thousand millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share."" ""It makes absolutely no sense to raise taxes on the middle class at a time when so many are still trying to get back on their feet,"" Obama said, adding he would ""continue to urge Congress to stop playing politics with the security of millions of American families and small business owners and get this done."" A Republican alternative that would freeze discretionary government spending and cut federal jobs, while also raising Medicare costs for Americans with incomes above $750,000 a year, also got blocked by opposition from both parties on a 20-78 vote. Despite the outcome of the votes, a softening of Republican opposition to extending the lower payroll tax rate raised expectations for eventual congressional passage of a compromise plan. House Republican leaders are working on their own proposal to extend unemployment benefits and the payroll tax cut, but several GOP aides told CNN it was unclear if these extensions would be rolled into one bill or end up as separate legislative proposals. GOP leaders planned a closed-door meeting Friday morning to discuss options with rank-and-file members on how to pay for the extensions. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, signaled his support for an eventual deal Thursday by telling reporters: ""I don't think there's any question that the payroll tax relief, in fact, helps the economy."" His stance represented a sharp shift from previous opposition by Senate Republicans to extending the payroll tax cut. On Sunday, conservative Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, said Republicans opposed extending the lower payroll tax rate because it didn't provide much help to the economy. ""The payroll tax holiday has not stimulated job creation,"" Kyl said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""We don't think that is a good way to do it."" The GOP opposition wavered Wednesday when Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said his party would support an extension of the payroll tax cut, but opposed a tax increase to pay for it. ""Republicans will put aside their misgivings and support this extension, not because we believe, as the president does, that another short-term stimulus will turn this economy around ... but because we know it will give some relief to struggling workers out there who continue to need it nearly three years into this presidency,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor. A tax on wealthy Americans to pay for the plan would punish ""the private sector businesses that the American people are counting on to help turn this economy around,"" McConnell said. The White House and Democrats have pushed back hard against the Republican argument. Alan Krueger, the new chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told reporters this week that the proposed surtax on incomes above $1 million ""would hit very few small businesses."" ""The vast majority -- one figure I saw was 99% of individuals with small business income -- would not be affected by this,"" Krueger said. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Thursday that the question is whether ""it is worth giving 160 million Americans, taxpayers, a tax break of $1,500 by asking 300,000 Americans to pay a little more."" Both Carney and Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer of New York noted that the issue is turning in their favor, with Republican opposition to the Democratic plan softening. ""This would've been unheard of even six months ago,"" Schumer said of a possible break from the Republican anti-tax orthodoxy. ""But we're changing the debate and the public is with us."" However, two Democratic senators -- Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana -- and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who caucuses with the Democrats, opposed the party's proposal. The measure would have failed even if all three supported it, due to the near-unanimous Republican opposition. Only moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine sided with Democrats in backing the proposal. Boehner's comments showed that both parties now publicly acknowledge the benefits of the payroll tax cut. According to the non-partisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 121 million families have benefited from the payroll tax break, with an increase in take-home pay of $934 for the average worker. Moody's Analytics estimated in August that letting the tax cut expire would reduce growth by as much as 0.5%. It called extending the cut one of the ""most straightforward"" ways to ""reduce some of the coming fiscal restraint."" Obama challenged Republicans on Wednesday to ""fight as hard for middle-class families as you do for those who are more fortunate,"" a dig at the GOP refusal to consider the longstanding Democratic push for higher taxes on the wealthiest Americans. Speaking at a high school in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Obama evoked a loud cheer when he said the Democratic proposal to extend and expand the reduced payroll tax rate ""is paid for by asking our wealthiest citizens to pay their fair share."" The Democratic bill blocked in the Senate would extend and expand last year's tax break. Payroll taxes, cut to 4.2% from 6.2% last year, would be lowered to 3.1% to provide middle-class families with up to $1,500 more in their paychecks next year. The measure also would partially extend the break to employers, hoping that might spur hiring. The price tag of the bill is about $265 billion, which would be paid for by the 3.25% surtax on annual income above $1 million, according to Democratic aides. Meanwhile, the Senate Republican plan that also was blocked would continue the 4.2% payroll tax rate for a year and pay for it by imposing a three-year freeze on federal salaries and reducing the federal work force by 10% through replacing workers when they quit or retire. In addition, the plan would require Americans earning $750,000 a year or more to pay higher premiums for Medicare, and prevent millionaires from getting food stamps or unemployment compensation. According to a Republican aide, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that the Medicare, food stamp and unemployment provisions would save $9 billion over 10 years, mostly from Medicare.

"(CNN) -- Ugandan authorities did not initially detect an Ebola outbreak because patients weren't showing typical symptoms of the lethal virus, the nation's health minister told CNN on Sunday. Patients had fevers and were vomiting, but did not show other typical symptoms like hemorrhaging, Health Minister Dr. Christine Ondoa said. A team made up of personnel from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Ugandan health ministry and the World Health Organization early Monday were in Kibaale, a district in the midwestern part of the landlocked central African nation, WHO said in a statement. Medecins Sans Frontieres, also known as Doctors Without Borders, also is involved in setting up an ""isolation center"" at Kibaale's hospital. National health authorities say the outbreak has infected at least 20 people, of whom 14 have died. Nine of the deaths were from a single household in the village of Nyanswiga, according to WHO. A medic who was treating victims is among the dead, Ondoa said. Officials are trying to determine the extent of the outbreak, CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said Sunday. The Atlanta-based organization was sending about five people to join a group of CDC staffers who are permanently based in Uganda, according to the spokesman. ""These outbreaks have a tendency to stamp themselves out, if you will, if we can get in and ... stop the chain of transmission,"" he said. Ondoa described the Ebola-Sudan strain detected as ""mild"" compared to other types of Ebola, noting that victims' lives can be saved with intervention. The cases have emerged in Kibaale, where a national task force had been mobilized in an effort to combat the outbreak. As of early Monday in Uganda, two people with the virus remained hospitalized in stable condition, said WHO. One was a 38-year-old woman who'd attended to her sister, the medic who died, and another was a 30-year-old woman who participated in the burial of one of the other victims. The Ebola virus is considered a highly infectious disease spread through direct contact with bodily fluids, with symptoms that include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, measles-like rash, red eyes and at times bleeding from body openings. Health officials urged the public to report suspected cases and avoid contact with anyone who has contracted the virus and to disinfect the bedding and clothing of an infected person by using protective gloves and masks. Officials also advised against eating dead animals, especially monkeys, and to avoid public gatherings in the affected district. Given these precautions, WHO said in its statement that it would not recommend any travel restrictions to Uganda because of the Ebola outbreak. An explainer on Ebola . CNN's Nick Valencia, David Ariosto, Nana Karikari-apau, Jennifer Deaton and Miriam Falco contributed to this report.","NEW: WHO and CDC experts are in Kibaale near the outbreak's center, WHO says .

"(CNN) -- If there's one thing that kills bedroom coziness, home decorators say, it's a bed-in-a-bag set. It might seem like a smart idea to buy everything together, but ultra-coordinated, flat bedding and stiff comforters often found in bagged bedding are the enemy of an inviting bedroom, said Holly Browning, DIY blogger and former home accent and interior designer. ""Fluff is key, like clouds or cotton,"" Browning said. For her, and many decorators who contributed to this week's ""inviting bedrooms"" Open House assignment, the feel of bedding is important. Whether it's crisp, white sheets from a store like Target or expensive, vintage-looking throws from Anthropologie, decorators say it's important to feel like you're sleeping on a cloud. And to get that feel, you must control the fluff. A carefully curated collection of down duvets, mattress pads, quilts and blankets of different thicknesses allow for temperature control and comfort, whether you're fast asleep or sniffling through a miserable flu bug -- and that probably won't come from a preselected, oversized bag, decorators said. But is it just decorator snobbery? When pressed, decor blogger Emily Clark said, ""A bed in a bag can sometimes be a good jumping-off point, if you add some other elements like patterned sheets or different shams."" Likewise, Browning relented: ""Well, it's OK, really. If you are unsure of what pillows and bedding accessories you like, then buying a bag might be best."" But she also pointed out that the pillows in said bag are ""not always the softest material,"" and that matters a lot. Pillows . Pillows are key, decorators said, and they must be chosen carefully. ""Pillows have always been a big discussion in our house,"" said interior designer and The Little Black Door blogger Elizabeth Baumgartner. ""After a lot of trial and error, I've found that we need at least one king-size synthetic pillow and one regular-size down pillow per person."" The combination, she said, is perfection. ""I think every bed needs several good pillows besides the decorative kind,"" said Clark. The calming, white master bedroom she decorated is ""the most comfortable place for me in our home,"" she said. Julie Holloway, part of the Milk and Honey Home decorator team from Roswell, Georgia, also finds pillows paramount. ""My husband and I love our Tempur-Pedic pillows that mold to the shape of our neck and head,"" she said. ""Our young boys love them, too, and steal them often."" Furniture . But scratchy sheets aside, comforters that match throw pillows that match curtains, elicit a shudder and ""ugh"" from interior designers like Shannon Berrey. And what of a matched suite of bedroom furniture? They inspired the same kind of disdain. ""Don't do it!"" Berrey pleaded, urging a more eclectic approach. The ""paint by numbers"" mountain vacation bedroom Berrey designed embodies her decorating aesthetic. ""Some vintage pieces, some new, different wood tones, some painted,"" is how she put together a cozy, inviting bedroom for clients. Interior decorator and blogger Bethany Brower said matching bedroom furniture makes her feel ""claustrophobic."" ""Matching bedroom sets are definitely a buzzkill for me,"" Little House on the Update blogger Corrie Moore said. ""I feel like a bedroom can be uncomfortable if it's too formal."" Headboards . And according to the logic of most bedroom decorating schemes, designers say the bed and headboard are more important than the rest of the furniture. ""A headboard gives the bed a presence in the room,"" Clark said. ""Whether it's a full bed frame or even just a pretty quilt hanging on the wall behind the bed, a headboard makes the room feel more finished."" ""Important"" doesn't always mean ""expensive."" Many headboards featured in this week's gallery are DIY projects. ""This spot is so special to my husband and me because we built and upholstered the bed ourselves,"" Kelly Marzka said. ""Every night when we crawl in to sleep, we're reminded of this project we took on, not knowing if we could even do it."" CNN iReport head-honcho and home decor blogger Katie Hawkins-Gaar is similarly proud of the impact her DIY headboard has on her master bedroom. ""We have an Ikea Malm bed, something that was in our price range when we first bought it, but it never really stood out on its own,"" she said. ""After making a custom headboard, it's like we have a brand new bed! It gave our bedroom so much character and the fact that it's handmade -- it was my husband's first attempt at a project of that scale -- makes it so much more meaningful."" The large headboard Browning created for her master bedroom reflects her personal style. ""Right now I am loving gray and silver. The corrugated steel roofing I used for this one is shiny and massive,"" she said. ""It's not very feminine but it creates a soft, romantic reflection from the side lamps."" Lighting . Clark also finds that lamps are an indispensable ingredient to an inviting bedroom. ""I recently moved the lamps in our bedroom to another room in the house, and we were with only an overhead light for a couple of months,"" she said. ""It just felt so cold to me."" Soft light makes a bedroom cozier, she said. So, too, can black-out drapes, or even eye masks and white noise machines. Light-limiting drapes can come in handy for the occasional sick day, Brower said. ""There's nothing worse than being laid up in bed with a cold and it's sunny and wonderful just outside the window. I can pull my drapes shut and block out the sun and pretend I'm not missing out on a glorious day,"" she said. TVs . The only thing it seems decorators can't agree on when it comes to bedrooms is whether to put a TV in the room. For some, like Berrey, it's a must. ""I know for so many a TV in the bedroom is a big no-no, but I have to have a TV in the bedroom. I love to lay in bed and watch TV until I fall asleep. It's really the only thing I need; No scented sprays or the sounds of crashing waves, just the sounds of the 'Real Housewives,'"" she said. Even if they think TVs don't belong in bedrooms, decorators confess to it apologetically. ""I know I'm in the minority,"" Baumgartner said, ""but no TV."" ""I'll be hated for this one,"" said Holloway, who says TVs destroy the cozy vibe of a bedroom. ""Are we not bombarded by screens? If you can swing it, no home office or TV in your bedroom."" Are you obsessed with decorating your house? Show us your skills at CNN's Open House and your photo could be featured in next week's story. Our next focus: well-dressed mantels.","Decorators: Bed-in-a-bag sets can be stiff and too coordinated for a cozy room.

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal remained the only one of the ""Big Four"" still standing Friday after third seed Andy Murray joined Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer in exiting the Madrid Masters. Nadal dropped the opening set to fellow Spaniard David Ferrer and trailed 4-2 in the second before mounting a typical comeback to reach the semifinals. But Murray, playing in the night session, was beaten 7-6 6-4 by Czech Tomas Berdych. Murray, who will still take over as No.2 from Federer in the new rankings, was a break up in the first set but could not press home his advantage and a single break for the big-hitting Berdych in the second was enough to see him through. In the women's WTA event in the Spanish capital, Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova remained on course for a final showdown as both reached the last four, but by contrasting routes. No.1 Williams was given an almighty scare by wildcard Anabel Medina Garrigues before winning 6-3 0-6 7-5. The American superstar had not dropped a set all tournament until being blanked in the second set, only the seventh time in her career she had suffered such a fate. ""I wasn't really there, my feet weren't moving -- I don't know what happened,"" she told the official WTA website. ""To turn it around I got up earlier on the changeover and started doing high knees and just stretching and doing anything to try to get my intensity back up to where it needed to be."" She will face Italian Sara Errani in the semifinals Saturday while Sharapova reached that stage with a 6-2 6-4 cruise against Estonia's Kaia Kanepi. Sharapova will leapfrog Williams to No.1 if she can go one round further or beat her in the final should both reach it. ""I was just really determined today, and I'm happy I was able to win with that type of scoreline,"" the Russian said after her passage to the semifinals where she will play former No.1 Ana Ivanovic of Serbia. Nadal later emerged on Center Court for a battle royale with Ferrer, who dominated the early sparring. He took the opening set 6-4 in 51 minutes and was a break up in the second before the former No.1 hit back by taking the next three games. Mallorcan Nadal served for the set at 5-4 but was broken by Ferrer as the match went to a crucial tiebreak. It was comfortably won by Nadal who swept through the decider for a 4-6 7-6 6-0 win, his 18th in 22 clashes with Ferrer. Nadal is looking to reach his seventh straight final since returning to the ATP Tour after injury in February and his beaten opponent knows only too well his abilities. ""Rafa is always the favorite on clay,"" he told the official ATP website. ""Without any doubt he's the best and he's really fit right now."" Nadal will play Pablo Andujar for a place in the final after his fellow Spaniard ended the run of Federer's conqueror Kei Nishikori of Japan in straight sets 6-3 7-5 later Friday. Berdych, bidding for a second straight Madrid final, will take on Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka, who put out seventh seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France in a three-set late night thriller.","Rafael Nadal taken to three sets by David Ferrer in Madrid Masters .

"(CNN) -- Demands. Prayers. Chants. Exhortations. Reflections. As Egypt reels from protest to protest, for many Egyptians it has never been more important to get message out about why they are on the streets -- to each other, to the media, to any opposing side. The country has been rocked in recent days by protesters demanding the resignation of former President Mohamed Morsy, with demonstrations at times threatening to spiral out of control as the pro- and anti-government sides clash violently, at times fatally, over the country's young democracy. The protests are the latest to wrack the country in what has proved a dramatic, often bloody, two years since the country's 2011 revolution ousted former President Hosni Mubarak. Morsy was elected in Egypt's first democratic elections a year later, but since then critics say he has become increasingly authoritarian, while the country's economy continues to falter. This crisis has led to many of his supporters amongst the poor and middle class to become disaffected, analysts say. Who is Egypt's President Mohamed Morsy? Those opposed to Morsy are a broad group, from youth groups and political coalitions to average citizens and Mubarak loyalists keen to return to power. CNN spoke to four anti-Morsy protesters about why they were on the streets, what they are demanding, and where they see their country heading. Scores of Egyptians have contacted CNN through iReport -- overwhelmingly representing the anti-Morsy faction. Their responses ranged from excitement, to trepidation, to optimism. But all shared one determination -- change for Egypt. Here's what they had to say, in their own words. The veteran . Ahmed Raafat has documented the streets of Cairo since the early days of the country's 2011 revolution. He is 23 and a petroleum engineer and photographer. I protest because I have a dream of changing Egypt for the better. I think this country deserves better than this. Nothing has changed since the beginning of the revolution. Dramatic photos, videos from iReport capture Egypt's crisis . I've seen many people of my age and social background falling during our fight for freedom. I still remember carrying them and having their blood on my hands. I don't want their blood to go in vain. When I stand beside thousands of people and we chant together, I feel free and strong. I've never had the chance to experience such feelings before the revolution. The feeling that you're not alone makes you feel stronger. [At present] the atmosphere of uncertainty makes me nervous. Not knowing how things will turn out makes me worry. I'm excited to see millions on the streets, but I have fears and concerns regarding the role of the military in the coming period. We suffered under military rule in the period following Mubarak's resignation, and I don't want to experience that again. The documenter . Mohamed Boraie lives in Cairo and works in finance, as well as working as a photographer who has captured images of the protests. He is 27. The main reason that I am protesting -- this time -- is that the Muslim Brotherhood and Morsy are not being inclusive. Morsy was appointing minsters and lead figures in the government that are exclusively from the Muslim Brotherhood [Islamist movement backing Morsy that has risen to power since the fall of Mubarak]. Opinion: Why Morsy deserves a chance . In addition, he could not restore law and order during the first year of presidency, not to mention his weak economic reforms that every Egyptian is currently facing. Another personal reason for protesting is how religion is being used and manipulated by the Muslim Brotherhood in a country where there is a huge illiteracy rate. Such misuse of religion is allowing the exploitation of the population in terms of wealth, human rights and women's participation in the work force. Taking part in a protest feels like someone is getting back an ownership of [their] country. I believe that Egyptians are evolving politically very quickly, and they will not give up unless their demands are met. I'm excited to see Egypt going through an Islamic state, failing and evolving very quickly to refuse such a state, [but] I'm nervous to see what is next. The optimist . Maged Eskander is an architect who lives in Cairo. He is 38. My family and I are out in the streets for the same reason we protested against the old regime -- the only difference this time is the ruling party is much, much worse. Who are the protesters? [Protesting is] one of the best feelings you can [have] ... you finally feel that Egypt is with you. You feel you are not alone; you get back the feeling of being proud to be Egyptian. Everybody in the marches is very happy, it's like we already won the battle. We will stay in the streets until he resigns or the military force [Morsy] to resign.

"(CNN) -- Heavy storms and tornadoes once again ripped through the Midwest on Friday night. Already devastated areas of Oklahoma were hit again, and this time the damage spread to neighboring states. Over a dozen people are reported dead and many more are reported injured after at least 17 tornadoes touched down across the region. By Saturday, more than 210,000 customers were without power in the Midwest -- 89,000 in Missouri, 86,000 in Oklahoma, 31,000 in Illinois, 3,000 in Arkansas, 1,000 in Kansas and 500 in Indiana. The threat is not over as heavy rain continues to fall and raise the threat for flooding, particularly in Missouri just north of St. Louis. It hasn't even been two weeks since a devastating tornado destroyed much of the Oklahoma City suburb of Moore, but because this storm is so soon after the first one, many of the organizations able to help people are already on the ground. The Red Cross . The Red Cross of Oklahoma and The Red Cross of St. Louis are already assessing damage and providing emergency care, food and shelters for those affected by this new round of storms. You can help their efforts by donating to the Red Cross online or by texting REDCROSS to 90999. This will automatically charge $10 to your cell phone bill. If you are outside of the United States and wish to contribute to the efforts of the Red Cross, please visit its international partner, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent. Samaritan's Purse . Samaritan's Purse deployed a group of staff members to travel from its North Carolina headquarters to Oklahoma with a Disaster Relief Unit right after the first storm hit. They came with a tractor trailer stocked with emergency supplies and equipment. Two groups of volunteers have remained in Shawnee, Oklahoma, and Moore, Oklahoma. They sought shelter through the storm last night and are ready to mobilize and help the newest survivors in need of assistance. AmeriCares . Global health and disaster relief nonprofit AmeriCares has an emergency response team helping in Oklahoma. It will coordinate aid deliveries and assess the needs of survivors and medical organizations in the area. Team Rubicon . Team Rubicon, a group of military veterans who respond to disasters, is another group that is already in Oklahoma helping survivors. Members also rode out the storm last night, but they have already emerged to assist in search and rescue efforts. The Salvation Army . The Salvation Army has also jumped into action. Members have mobilized their canteens throughout the region, providing food, hydration and emotional support to first responders and storm survivors. You can contribute to the Salvation Army by calling 1-800-SAL-ARMY (1-800-725-2769), on their website or by texting ""STORM"" to 80888 to make an automatic $10 donation. Save the Children . Save the Children is another organization already hard at work in the Moore, Oklahoma, area and is ready to respond to the now widened scope of damage and people in need.

"(CNN) -- Rick Perry is really starting to annoy me. When Rick Perry announced he was running for president back on August 13, to tell you the truth I got a little excited. Now I know what you're thinking -- James you are a big Democrat, why on earth would you be excited about Perry running for president? And as Ricky used to tell Lucy -- I got some 'splainin to do. This was my thinking: Perry would get in and he would be a major force. After all he was governor of the state of Texas, great hair, been around politics for a while. He was the bona fide conservative complete with a pedigree to take on Romney. A giant fight to the death would ensue and they would bludgeon each other half to death -- you get the picture. Honestly, I enjoy nothing more than two Republicans going after each other. Secondly, when politics is interesting it is actually good for me. In case you haven't noticed, I'm a cable television commentator -- the more interesting the campaign, the more coverage, the more I'm on TV -- you get the drift. Also, as some of you may be aware of, I've been known to give a speech or two in return for remuneration. The people that plan these sorts of things generally hire more political speakers when politics is interesting and in turn I'll make more money and then John Boehner and Eric Cantor will start referring to me as a job creator. With the way things are shaping up now, the event planners might be more inclined to take a motivational speaker, a magician, or a square dance troop. Hey Rick -- you are costing me airtime and money. Third, there is a dirty little secret about political people that I'm going to share with you. These political people include operatives, politicians, volunteers, bloviators, journalists, pundits, columnists, staffers -- we actually like politics and campaigns. Maybe you, like me, are a baseball fan. If you are, you want seven games because you actually like baseball. The same goes for politics -- if you really love it, you hope for a good race that goes on and you enjoy watching people who are skilled at doing this. It is literally painful to watch Rick Perry as a candidate. The case could be made that Rick Perry is the worst debater to ever run for president. As far as I know he can't even give a good speech. His appearance before the uber-right-winged Values Voters Summit was universally trashed. Not only can he not give an interview, he can't even roll out his stupid flat tax plan. He steps all over it by saying, ""Oh by the way, it's optional anyway."" He has managed to couple the flat tax with the IRS bureaucracy in one sentence. Way to go Rick. I'll be blunt with all you Perry supporters, it's time to butter your guy because he's toast. Every day it's a new dumb thing. From birtherism, to convoluted tax policy, to inarticulate attacks, to woeful ignorance and even stupidity on foreign policy (Pakistani country? Please), to placing his wife under such stress that she is lashing out at everything around her. Not only is Rick Perry utterly incapable of running for president, he can't run his state, and in fact can't meet the basic requirement for any politician -- he can't even run his mouth. As if he hasn't made a big enough fool of himself, he decides to go out and have lunch with Donald Trump and falls for the birther strategy. Good God, can this guy do anything? I guess I should be fair to him, he has shown that he can get the same people he gave contracts to as governor of Texas to contribute to his campaign. Wow, what an achievement. To tell you the truth, it's gotten so bad people in Louisiana are actually starting to make Texas jokes. If this thing gets any worse the people in Mississippi will be making Texas jokes -- then you've really hit rock bottom. Rick, you have managed to embarrass yourself and irritate the hell out of me. So I guess you are good at something after all. PS: See where the media is reporting that Perry is ""retooling"" his campaign. I think their problem is with the Indian, not the arrow. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Carville.","James Carville says Rick Perry is starting to get on his nerves .

"(CNN) -- A Montana woman pleaded not guilty to murder and other charges Friday, three months after she allegedly pushed her newlywed husband off a cliff as they hiked through a national park. Jordan Linn Graham was arraigned Friday in a U.S. District Court in Missoula, Montana, about 130 miles south of where her newlywed husband Cody Johnson fell to his death on July 7. A federal grand jury on Thursday charged Graham with first- and second-degree murder and making false statements. On Friday, she was read those charges but waived a reading of the indictment, according to a court document. She subsequently pleaded not guilty on all three counts, was released as she had been before, and her next court appearance was set for October 15. The entire proceeding took about four minutes. A call placed by CNN to the federal public defender's office representing Graham was not immediately returned Friday afternoon, though her attorney has previously said the groom's death was an accident. Johnson and Graham had been married for a little more than a week when Cody Johnson died on a hiking trail in Glacier National Park. An affidavit supporting the charges against Graham states that she told police she decided to travel with Johnson to the hiking trail the evening of July 7 and an argument ensued. ""Graham stated their argument intensified. At one point in time during their arguing, Graham turned and began to walk away. She stated Johnson grabbed her by the arm,"" reads the affidavit. Graham said she then turned around and removed his hand. ""Graham stated she could have just walked away, but due to her anger, she pushed Johnson with both hands in the back and as a result, he fell face first off the cliff,"" according to the affidavit. Michael Donahoe, Graham's lawyer, said last month that Johnson pinned his wife down at one point during their argument. The final part of their fight -- ending with Johnson falling off the cliff -- was ""all in one motion, the grabbing and pushing,"" according to Donahoe. Johnson's body was found several days later. The affidavit also states that Graham texted a friend that same night her husband died, saying in the message that she was going to talk to Johnson about having ""second thoughts."" Graham texted, ""Oh well, I am about to talk to him."" Her friend responded, ""I'll pray for you guys."" Graham then replied, ""Dead serious, if u don't hear from me at all again tonight, something happened,"" according to a court document filed in the case. The case is being handled in federal court because the death occurred inside a national park. CNN's John Branch contributed to this report.","NEW: Jordan Linn Graham pleads not guilty to murder, making false statements .

"(CNN) -- Airlines around the world canceled flights to and from the northeast United States as a massive storm slammed into the coast of New Jersey and New York. Hurricane Sandy, now rated as a ""post-tropical"" superstorm, forced the closure of New York's JFK and LaGuardia airports and Newark in New Jersey ""until further notice"" as rising flood waters washed across parts of the city, while domestic and international flights were canceled at other major airports in the region. Middle Eastern, European, Asian and U.S. airlines prepared to take a financial hit, with the weather stranding their passengers in cities across the globe. ""Every day this goes on you're seeing combined losses to the airlines of roughly $10 million,"" said Simon Calder, travel editor of the UK's The Independent newspaper. Sandy's impact: State by state . ""The cost is actually much worse for European airlines like British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, because they have to pay for accommodation and meals for their customers who are stuck in the U.S. -- particularly in New York."" European Union law says airlines have a ""duty of care"" to take care of stranded passengers. There is no such law governing U.S. airlines. ""Delta and United can just say, 'Sorry, this is a weather event and you're not covered,'"" Calder told CNN. At least 50,000 travelers between the UK and U.S. have been affected by the storm, Calder estimates. In Asia, airlines grounded more flights as the extent of the storm became clear. Australia's Qantas, Korean Airlines and Japan's JAL canceled all New York-bound flights on Tuesday and Cathay Pacific said Wednesday's departures to JFK would also be scrubbed. With 11 flights canceled to and from New York, Washington D.C., Philadelphia and Baltimore, British Airways has offered to rebook flights for its passengers. A statement on BA's website said: ""We understand that customers may be disappointed, however their safety is our highest priority."" The airline's flights to and from Boston were expected to operate normally. Britain's Virgin Atlantic also canceled all flights to New York, but announced that flights to Washington and Boston were scheduled to begin again on Tuesday. More than 80 flights from London's Heathrow Airport to the U.S. East Coast were canceled, including 47 arrivals and 37 departures. Sandy halts travel along East Coast . Karen Mackenzie from Essex, in southeastern England, was planning to fly Monday to New York on a Virgin holiday package, but the airline canceled her entire holiday due to the storm. While Virgin Atlantic gave Mackenzie a full refund, the elementary school principal says her schedule means she won't be able to rebook the holiday until next year. ""I feel really horrible for those poor people in New York at the moment. It's disappointing to lose our holiday, but for them it's a much more hideous situation,"" she told CNN. Qatar Airways and the United Arab Emirates-based airlines Etihad and Emirates also canceled flights to the U.S. northeast. In a statement Emirates said the safety of their passengers ""will not be compromised."" Air France, Germany's Lufthansa, Ireland's Aer Lingus and Turkish Airlines have also scrubbed flights in and out of New York. Sandy claims 'Bounty' off North Carolina . Some 50 million people from Virginia to Massachusetts are expected to feel the effect of Sandy, which made landfall in New Jersey late Monday. The cost of potential wind damage alone could be up to $3 billion, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The storm has also prompted thousands of domestic flight cancellations across America. While all American Airlines flights to the east coast are canceled, the airline is operating a normal service to other parts of the country. United Airlines grounded roughly 3,700 flights between Sunday and Wednesday, and Delta said all flights from Washington to Boston, and out of New York and Philadelphia, were canceled. Both companies are allowing some customers to change their flight plans without paying any fees due to the storm. So how long will it take for airlines to get stranded passengers to their destinations once the hurricane subsides? Not long, according to CNN's Richard Quest, who said the problem should start being resolved from Wednesday. ""All the airlines have exceptionally sophisticated recovery programs,"" he explained. ""What they do is they don't make the flight to the first place. They don't send the aircraft into the bad areas, so they don't get stranded. They're now already starting to work out flights for Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. You write off Monday and Tuesday, then you start to rebuild the schedule."" ""After the [Icelandic volcanic] ash cloud two years ago, airlines were able to restore the schedule quite quickly, simply because people canceled their flights [and didn't rebook]. And that's what the airlines are banking on. ""I'm guessing that by the weekend everyone [will have] got where they need to be."" How to help .

"New York (CNN) -- The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, one of the oldest civil rights groups in the nation, announced the successor to Chairman Julian Bond on Saturday as the organization strives to prove its relevance and influence to a new generation. NAACP Vice Chair Roslyn Brock was selected to fill the seat left by Bond, a civil rights leader who has held the post since 1998. Brock, 44, is the youngest person to ever serve in the position. Brock has worked with the organization for more than 25 years in various roles, including as a youth board member and president of its Youth and College State Conference, according to the NAACP. She is also a vice president at Bon Secours Health Systems in Marriottsville, Maryland. ""We're looking at a generational shift in our communities,"" Brock said in a statement posted on the NAACP Web site. ""We have a 48 year old President in the White House, an NAACP President who was 35 at the time of his election, and a 44 year old Board Chair. The wisdom of those who stood the test of time got us to this point, and the youth will lead the future success of our movement."" Brock's perspective -- that of a younger leader -- will help move the 101-year-old organization forward, said Mary Frances Berry, former chairwoman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. ""I think it's a great decision by the board because it changes the leadership intergenerationally,"" Berry told CNN on Saturday.""Her views will respect those of a post-protest, civil rights generation."" The sit-ins and marches demanding racial equality have been replaced with social tussles disproportionately affecting non-white communities. Such issues include unemployment, foreclosures and incarceration rates, and Brock will have to address those in moving the NAACP forward, Berry said. ""They've got to focus on the problems that people at the grass roots have,"" she said. Brock made history in February 2001 when she was unanimously elected vice chair of the NAACP National Board of Directors at the age of 35, making her the youngest and first women to get the job. ""She's very different from Julian. But the fact that she's younger, vibrant, very dynamic -- I think it's great,"" said historian Patricia A. Sullivan, whose book, ""Raise Every Voice,"" chronicled the history of the NAACP. ""It's an important position, and I think having someone like her in that position says something."" Bond, a stalwart of the Civil Rights Movement, helped found the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, known for its student sit-ins in the early 1960s, and served as the first president of the Southern Poverty Law Center. He served in both houses of the Georgia Legislature, totaling two decades in office, before later leading the NAACP as chairman. The 70-year-old civil rights leader had indicated he was ready to leave the organization in 2008, but stayed on in 2009 as the NAACP celebrated its 100th anniversary. Read a Q&A with Roslyn Brock at Essence.com . At the time, there was talk about whether the organization was still relevant in what some observers called a ""post-racial"" United States. John McWhorter, a linguist and conservative political commentator, spelled it out in a February 2009 column titled, ""If the NAACP ceased to exist tomorrow, would it have a significant effect on black America?"" For Bond, the answer was obvious. ""We have for the first time a black man who can open the doors to Air Force One, but we now know his children couldn't go to a pool in Philadelphia,"" Bond told CNN in July, referring to a decision by a suburban Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, swim club to revoke privileges of a largely minority day care center last year. ""So, as long as this disparity exists, we're not the national association for the advancement of one colored person, we want all colored people to advance,"" he continued. ""And for us, people come in all colors -- black, brown, yellow, everything. We want everyone to advance, everyone to progress, and until that's true, the NAACP is going to be here."" And to ensure it will be here, the organization has showcased youthful leaders among its ranks -- most notably tapping Benjamin Todd Jealous as its president in 2008. At 35, Jealous was the youngest ever to hold the post at the NAACP. Berry, who now teaches history at the University of Pennsylvania, was on the NAACP search committee at the time. ""The organization is clearly doing what every organization should do -- they should renew their leadership and reach out to the next generation,"" Berry said Friday. ""Otherwise, they'll die."" In his speech on the 100th anniversary of the NAACP, President Obama said ""the pain of discrimination is still felt in America"" among African-Americans, Latinos and Muslim Americans. ""Even as we inherit extraordinary progress that cannot be denied; even as we marvel at the courage and determination of so many plain folks -- we know that too many barriers still remain,"" he said. CNN's Samira Simone and Khadijah Rentas contributed to this report.","NEW: ""We're looking at a generational shift in our communities,"" Roslyn Brock says .

"(CNN) -- In the most comprehensive speech he has delivered on terrorism, President Barack Obama declared last month that the ""core of al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan is on a path to defeat."" On May 23, the very same day that Obama delivered this keynote speech at the National Defense University in Washington, Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of the core of al Qaeda, fired off a lengthy memo to two al Qaeda affiliates in the Middle East. This memo demonstrates Zawahiri considers himself and the al Qaeda core to be still relevant and very much in charge of the global jihadist movement. The Zawahiri memo, which was published on Monday by the Al Jazeera news network in the original Arabic, is addressed to the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq and the leader of Syria's Jabhat al-Nusra, which is a front organization for al Qaeda, according to the State Department. In the memo, Zawahiri chastises the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq, in a tone that an irritated parent might use, for announcing in April the merger of the Iraqi and Syrian wings of al Qaeda ""without asking permission or receiving advice from us and even without notifying us."" Zawahiri also unloaded on Sheikh Abu Muhammad al-Joulani, the leader of the Syrian wing of al Qaeda, who at the same time had publicly announced his allegiance to Zawahiri and the core of al Qaeda. Zawahiri complained that the Syrian branch of al Qaeda had publicly outed itself as an al Qaeda affiliate ""without having our permission."" He instructed that the merger of the al Qaeda's Iraqi and Syrian wings ""be dissolved"" and that the Syrian wing is ""under the (al Qaeda) general command."" Zawahiri said he made these decisions ""after holding consultations with my brothers in Khorosan,"" an ancient word for the region that today contains Afghanistan, which indicates that Zawahiri is able to communicate with, or perhaps even meet with, al Qaeda leaders along the Afghan-Pakistan border. Why does this matter? It matters because ""Al Qaeda Central"" is now trying to assert control over two of its most virulent affiliates. Al Qaeda in Iraq has mounted a series of spectacular attacks over the past year, which demonstrates that it is a force to be reckoned with again in Iraqi politics. The Congressional Research Service reported this month that there were some dozen days in 2012 in which al Qaeda carried out multicity attacks that have killed hundreds of Iraqis. And the al Qaeda affiliate in Syria is widely acknowledged to be the most effective fighting force that is now fighting the regime of Bashar al-Assad. A long-term safe haven for this group in Syria, which is in the heart of the Arab world and next door to Israel and that is now directed by al Qaeda Central, could create an organization with the intention and capability to attack the West. That Zawahiri continues to try to assert his control over al Qaeda-affiliated groups is not all that surprising considering that Osama bin Laden did the same thing while he was holed up in a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, for the last five years of his life before he was killed by a Navy SEAL team in early May 2011. Documents found at the Abbottabad compound show that al Qaeda's founder was deep in the weeds of key personnel decisions. In a letter to the Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, bin Laden was adamant that Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki not become that affiliate's new leader. Awlaki never did get promoted and was killed in a U.S. drone strike in 2011. The mere existence of the Zawahiri memo shows that he is able to communicate with relative ease with al Qaeda's affiliates in the Middle East. Because of the now-well documented dangers of using any kind of electronic communication system, Zawahiri, like bin Laden before him, is almost certainly using a courier network to hand-deliver his letters. In closing his letter to al Qaeda's affiliates in Syria and Iraq, Zawahiri appointed a man named Abu Khalid al-Suri to resolve any future disputes that might arise between the two groups. It isn't clear to what extent al Qaeda's affiliates in Syria and Iraq will actually pay attention to directives from Zawahiri but it is a fact that these affiliates have pledged their allegiance to him. If the core of al Qaeda is indeed on the road to defeat as Obama asserted three weeks ago, Zawahiri clearly hasn't gotten this message.","President Barack Obama said al Qaeda's core is headed for defeat .

"(CNN) -- Since 9/11, the United States has increasingly relied on drones to kill its enemies and to chip away at terrorism around the globe. Drone warfare has always been controversial. But it became virtually sensational during the heated discussion over John Brennan's nomination to be CIA chief. Responding to a question stemming from that discussion, Attorney General Eric Holder said this week that he wouldn't rule out the possibility of a drone strike against Americans on U.S. soil. But he said the administration wasn't planning on such a strike and would use the option only under extreme circumstances. Holder futher clarified the administration's stance Thursday with a brief letter to Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, who had staged a 13-hour filibuster of Brennan's confirmation. ""It has come to my attention that you have now asked an additional question: 'Does the President have the authority to use a weaponized drone to kill an American not engaged in combat on American soil?' "" Holder wrote. ""The answer to that question is no."" A to Z: The drone program . That satisfied Paul, who had ended his filibuster and allowed Brennan's confirmation to go on. But it hasn't ended the discussion about the use of drones over the United States. What's President Obama's argument? For some time, the administration has fervently defended the drone program in general, boasting that it has helped decimate al Qaeda and saved the lives of troops that might otherwise be involved in ground attacks. The United States has carried out 349 ""CIA drone strikes"" in Pakistan and 61 in Yemen, according to Washington-based nonpartisan think tank The New America Foundation. When it comes to drone strikes in Indiana or New York, the administration insists the unmanned machines could be used when an imminent threat to the United States is clear. Drone strikes on U.S. soil could be necessary when capture isn't feasible, the administration says. Dealing with a 9/11 or a Pearl Harbor-style attack -- or one that seems very likely -- could justify a domestic drone strike, Holder said. What law or precedent might support their argument? CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said there is no law on drone strikes. ""Police officers use weapons on American citizens all the time,"" he said. ""This is just another weapon."" The Supreme Court has held that the military may constitutionally use force against a U.S. citizen who is a part of enemy forces. But that's not in the United States. Again, there is other documentation about drone use against U.S. citizens abroad. Consider a Justice Department memo, given to select members of Congress last year, that says the U.S. government can use lethal force against American citizens overseas who are operational leaders of al Qaeda or its affiliates. One high-profile example of a U.S. citizen killed in a strike overseas is Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical cleric born and educated in the United States. A drone killed him in Yemen in 2011. Who are the most vocal opponents? The pushback against the administration has united unlikely bedfellows. Republicans and Democrats are both dubious of drones hovering over Americans. But while Paul stopped the Senate's work cold to express his displeasure, the GOP isn't standing as one over anti-terrorism tactics. Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham assailed Paul's filibuster. ""All I can say is that I don't think that what happened yesterday is helpful to the American people,"" McCain, R-Arizona, said on the Senate floor Thursday. At one point in his filibuster, Paul said there would be nothing stopping the United States from dropping a missile on Jane Fonda, who actively protested the Vietnam War in the 1970s. McCain, who admitted that Fonda wasn't his ""favorite American,"" was peeved by Paul's argument. ""Somehow to allege that the United States of America -- our government -- will drop a drone Hellfire missile on Jane Fonda, that brings the conversation from a serious discussion about U.S. policy to the realm of the ridiculous,"" he sniped. An American Civil Liberties Union lawyer called Obama the ""judge, jury and executioner"" in the matter, and said he agreed with Paul. What are the political overtones here? The debate, in a larger way, is about the struggle between the executive and legislative branches and which wields authority in such matters. There are also questions about how the issue might affect the next presidential election, when Obama's two terms will be up. Paul has hinted that he may run in 2016. The next president will probably, at least until challenged, assume the same authority Obama has regarding drone strikes. But Micah Zenko with the Council on Foreign Relations, an expert on drones and terrorism, cautions against too many predictions. ""This is such a fast-moving issue, and many parts are still being decided,"" he said. ""But I would add that if you look at how the topic played out in the last election, there was one question on drones in the third debate, and both candidates thought about it for 10 seconds and agreed they were great,"" he said. ""Maybe next time, it will take 20 seconds before they say that."" What's the larger issue at stake? Drones are becoming more common in general, and technology cannot be stopped, experts say. Controlling the technology and its capabilities will be incredibly difficult. So that will make the idea of transparency even more important. There has been ""a means of dealing with imminent threat in this country -- it's the police, a time-honored way of dealing with the guy who comes into Congress with a grenade launcher,"" said Tom Junod, an Esquire magazine writer who has written about Obama and the drone program. ""We wouldn't be talking about this if we didn't suddenly have this technology ability of taking out anybody we wish. ""It's the technology that has extended the arm of the law and executive attention."" The question for Americans is how far they want the president's arm to reach.","What is the administration's argument for targeting U.S. citizens on U.S. soil?

"(CNN) -- A robotic recycling system could help address the escalating global waste problem, according to Finnish technology company ZenRobotics. The ZenRobotics Recycler (ZRR) is an intelligent robotic system which separates construction materials on a conveyer belt, plucking out recyclable materials and depositing them in bins for collection. The system is designed to replace manual sorting, which can be dangerous and frequently prohibitively expensive. Worldwide, the construction and demolition sector is thought to contribute over one third of all waste. The U.S. alone contributes a staggering 325 million tons of waste every year, and the UK produces another 120 million tons. While household and municipal waste has fallen in recent years across the developed world, Waste Watch -- a not-for-profit sustainability organization based in the UK -- suggests that over 80% of all human waste that potentially could be recycled currently goes into landfill. ZenRobotics founder Jufo Peltomaa notes that the problem is equally severe across the EU: ""In the EU alone there's 900 million tons of construction and demolition waste. If you were to convert that to the average sized car, the queue would go 45 times around the globe."" Peltomaa and his team at ZenRobotics constructed the ZRR to help deal with this problem. ""It's a really difficult job for robots and machine learning systems to do,"" says Peltomaa. ""There are currently no such systems in the world, so our system is the first."" The ZRR identifies different types of waste using a process called ""sensor fusion."" By analysing the data, the sensors sort through objects on a conveyor belt and distribute them into surrounding chutes. The sensor fusion system uses a range of technologies including weight measurement, 3-D scanning, tactile assessment and spectrometer analysis, which measures how much light reflects from various different materials. ZenRobotics believes its creation will help ease the burden of the repetitive and dangerous job of waste filtration, which is currently done manually. ""Currently, construction and demolition waste is handled by manual pickers,"" says Peltomaa. ""That's a pretty good solution, but it's hazardous for your health. There are poisonous materials, sharp and heavy materials, plus asbestos etc."" Peltomaa says that the idea for using robots for recycling came to him when he had stayed up late watching a documentary on the Discovery Channel, in which a B52 bomber was crushed and recycled. The waste was placed onto a conveyor belt attended to by ""bored-looking"" employees picking through the rubble. Peltomaa says he immediately noticed two things: ""First of all it's really dangerous to be there because the process is really hazardous (and) second that the technology (we) had was a perfect fit. So we decided to do robotic sorting."" The ZRR's sensor fusion system works through a complex analysis procedure conducted once items are put onto the conveyor belt. The system's sensors gather data, which is sent across to the bespoke artificial intelligence system, christened by the team as the ""ZenRobotics Brain."" The brain assesses each object's material (wood, metal, stone, etc.) and decides what to do with it. Commands are then issued to the robotic arm, which picks up the objects and deposits them in the appropriate bin, ready for collection. Renowned industrial designer Stefan Lindfors says he believes the robot could contribute to global efforts to improve recycling, but adds that the real problem is something significantly more fundamental: ""there should be less waste for us to have to sort to begin with."" Lindfors says that inventions such as the ZRR robot raise important questions about global waste: ""Human beings have a lot to think about here -- how we pack things, how we wrap things up and how we use materials.""","New robotic system separates recyclable materials from construction waste .

"(CNN) -- As the global population hits 7 billion in the coming days, nations can take steps to tackle critical challenges and prepare for the arrival of billions more people this century, the United Nations said Wednesday. The milestone is expected to be reached on October 31. ""With planning and the right investments in people now ... our world of 7 billion can have thriving, sustainable cities, productive labor forces that can fuel economic growth, youth populations that contribute to the well-being of economies and societies, and a generation of older people who are healthy and actively engaged in the social and economic affairs of their communities,"" UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, said in a new report. Among the steps the report focuses on are empowering young people with economic opportunities; planning for the growth of cities; developing programs to share and sustain the Earth's resources; and improving education, including sexual education. A U.N. report published in May predicts a global population of 9.3 billion by 2050, and more than 10 billion by the end of this century. ""With only a small variation in fertility, particularly in the more populous countries, the total could be higher: 10.6 billion people could be living on Earth by 2050 and more than 15 billion in 2100,"" says the Population Division of the U.N. Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Much of the increase will come in Africa and Asia. In light of growing concerns about the global economy, the new UNFPA report highlights financial dangers facing people in industrialized and developing nations. ""While labor shortages threaten to stymie the economies of some industrialized countries, unemployed would-be migrants in developing countries are finding more and more national borders closed to them and the expertise they may have to offer. And while progress is being made in reducing extreme poverty, gaps between rich and poor are widening almost everywhere."" The 7 billion mark is a huge spike from less than a century ago. In 1927, the global population was 2 billion. It was only 13 years ago that the population was at 6 billion, the United Nations says. Changing demographics are quickly reshaping the world in numerous ways. People under the age of 25 make up 43% of the world's population, the United Nations says. About half of the world's population lives in cities. Within about 35 years, two-thirds will, it says. While reaching 7 billion in 2011 has long been predicted, the new U.N. report Wednesday -- ""State of World Population 2011"" -- highlights changes and trends to offer a complex picture. In a summary of the report, the agency notes that ""women are on average having fewer children than they were in the 1960s."" The number of children a woman is expected to have dropped from an average of 6 to 2.5, the report says. But there are far more women than there were in the 1960s. ""In some of the poorest countries, high fertility rates hamper development and perpetuate poverty, while in some of the richest countries, low fertility rates and too few people entering the job market are raising concerns about prospects for sustained economic growth and the viability of social security systems,"" the summary says. A few more facts and figures from the report: . --Today there are 893 million people over the age of 60; by the middle of the century, that number will rise to 2.4 billion. --Asia will remain the most populous area this century, but Africa ""will gain ground as its population more than triples, increasing from 1 billion in 2011 to 3.6 billion in 2100."" --The combined population of other areas -- including the Americas, Europe, and Oceania -- is currently 1.7 billion, and is expected to rise to nearly 2 billion by 2060, ""then decline very slowly.""","NEW: World population could surpass 15 billion by the end of the century, the U.N. says .

"Manzanillo, Cuba (CNN) -- At first the Cuban doctors thought they were dealing with an outbreak of food poisoning. The patients that arrived for treatment in mid-June at hospitals in Manzanillo had all gone to the same birthday party held at a house in the hilly countryside on the perimeter of the eastern Cuban city. The sick had eaten shrimp at the party and doctors thought that meal might be the cause for the patients' heavy vomiting and diarrhea. Then more people began walking into hospitals with similar symptoms. But they had not attended the party. ""They started coming in a few at a time,"" said Julio Cesar Fonseca Rivero, the director of the Celia Sanchez Manduley Hospital, the largest in the region. ""The first day five came, and then eight. That's not normal, that five people would come with the same symptoms. The most critical days were when there were 30 to 32 patients who arrived in a single day."" A sudden spike in cases of diarrhea is not unusual for Manzanillo's hospitals that treat the surrounding rural communities. There residents often live without indoor plumbing and in the summer months endure the scorching heat and heavy rains. Illness kills three in eastern Cuba . This summer had already been particularly hot with heavy rains that caused outhouses to flood into several drinking wells. Still, doctors suspected they were dealing with something they hadn't seen before. ""We became alarmed with the number of cases arriving. We usually see one or two cases of diarrhea each day,"" said Dr. Oyantis Matos Zamora, who oversees a clinic on the edge of the city that attends to rural residents. The symptoms some patients exhibited -- the rapid onset of watery diarrhea and dehydration â€” had also not been seen in generations. ""The way that the outbreak developed and the appearance of other similar cases in the region, we realized this was a problem of a different magnitude,"" said Dr. Manuel Santin PeÃ±a, Cuba's national director of epidemiology. The ""problem"" was cholera. Cuba's last cholera outbreak occurred over a century ago. Although eradicated in many countries, the disease, according to the World Health Organization, still infects between 3 million and 5 million people each year, killing between 100,000 and 120,000. In Manzanillo the outbreak has taken on a name of its own. There it's simply referred to by residents as ""el evento."" So far ""el evento"" has taken three lives and infected at least 110 people, said Santin. He said doctors were waiting on test results for tens of other possible cases but said so far fewer than 30% percent of suspected cases had been shown to be cholera. How cholera began in Haiti . He denied reports that the Cuban government has underreported the death toll or that the outbreak is spreading to other provinces. He said a handful of suspected cases had been identified elsewhere in the country. But he said those cases had come from the same region where the original outbreak took place and are believed to have been infected there. ""We can categorically say that there is no other outbreak in any other province,"" Santin told CNN, outside the entrance to the Celia Sanchez Manduley Hospital, where three more people had arrived suffering from severe diarrhea. Cuban health officials allowed a CNN crew to be the first media to film in the hospital and speak with doctors there about the ongoing effort to control the cholera outbreak. To combat the outbreak, the local government has closed 12 contaminated wells around Manzanillo, Santin said. Clean water is being trucked in for residents until a different source of water can be found. At the entrances to hospitals and government buildings in the city stand buckets for people to wash their hands and soles of their shoes with chlorine bleach. Cholera kills nearly 500 in Cameroon . Kiosks throughout Manzanillo that sell milkshakes, iced drinks or other foods that come into contact with water have been shuttered. A temporary ban has also been issued for fishing and bathing in waters off the coast that may be contaminated. While in the rest of the country little has been said in the official press about the cholera, in Granma province, the site of the outbreak, residents are now shown a nightly program on how to prevent infection. Santin told CNN those efforts appear to be working and that doctors are seeing a decline in the rate of infection. The perception that the outbreak was increasing, he said, came from the seven to 10 days it takes for Cuba's labs to return results of tests on the infected. ""The number of cases is dropping,"" he said. ""That doesn't make us confident so much as make us work to intensify all our preventive measures so that in the next few weeks we can stop the outbreak."" Maria Rosa Rodriguez has seen up close what cholera can do. The Manzanillo schoolteacher was hospitalized for a week with cholera and only recently was allowed return home to finish her recovery. She winced as she recounted the agony that the infection caused her. ""You're very nervous because we had never seen this before here,"" Rodriguez said. ""You're feeling bad with diarrhea, vomiting and you lose weight very quickly. You think the worst.""

"(CNN) -- YouTube is a source of entertainment and news for billions around the world, but Pakistanis have lost access to the video site for almost a year after clips of the controversial film ""Innocence of Muslims"" prompted a government ban. That ban will be challenged for the first time in court Wednesday -- and activists, as well as artists, some of whose careers were launched on YouTube, are keeping their fingers crossed. Rapper, singer and songwriter Adil Omar is a musician that has relied on social networking sites to launch his career. Even without a record label, he successfully used YouTube to reach both a domestic and international audience -- collaborating with international artists like Cypress Hill, Everlast, Xzibit and guitarist Slash from Guns 'N Roses. Producer of anti-Islam film on supervised release . YouTube ""has put me out there internationally. I've worked with major artists, been in the mainstream press,"" Omar said. But soon after the YouTube ban, response to his album plummeted. ""I'm getting about a tenth of the promotion I was getting before and I have about a tenth of the sales I was initially getting,"" he said. Numbers on YouTube reflect his comment. Omar's last major single ""Paki Rambo,"" released before the YouTube ban, generated more than 320,000 hits. One of his first singles after the ban got just over 30,000 clicks. Protests erupted across the Arab world last year when trailers for ""Innocence of Muslims,"" an anti-Islam film that mocks the prophet Mohammed, appeared online. YouTube is not the only social media website that was taken away from Pakistani Web users. Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr all have been banned in the past. The recent ban on YouTube, however, is the longest-running act of online censorship in Pakistan's history. Bytes for All, an organization that fights for digital rights in Pakistan, has worked to lift this censorship -- running a poster campaign, filing petitions and writing to the U.N. Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression. ""We do not need dictatorial nannies to tell people what to watch and what not to watch and what decision to take and how to take it. Because after all, it's a democracy. It's not a dictatorship anymore,"" said Furhan Hussain from Bytes for All. The ban on YouTube ""is in direct violation of the constitution of Pakistan. It violates the fundamental human rights of freedom of expression and freedom of access to information of the citizens of Pakistan,"" he said. CNN reached out for comment repeatedly to Pakistan's minister of information technology but got no response. Omar, like the activists from Bytes for All, hopes the ban will be lifted soon. ""What I'd like to see happen is for YouTube to open up again. For Pakistani artists and musicians to be able to earn money again and make a living ... to be able to reach an international audience again.""","A government ban on YouTube in Pakistan is being challenged in court Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Justice is denying reports that a Saudi court sentenced a man to be surgically paralyzed as punishment for having paralyzed another man, with the ministry adding that the judge in the case had ""dismissed requests for such punishment."" A series of tweets issued by the Justice Ministry admonished media outlets for having published those earlier reports, calling them ""untrue."" The ministry also slammed human rights organizations for having condemned Saudi Arabia based on those reports. ""We hope that everyone attempts to verify the facts and be accurate,"" said the ministry. News about the case first surfaced in local Saudi media last month. The Saudi Gazette, an English-language daily, reported that Ali Al-Khawahir was 14 when he stabbed and paralyzed his best friend 10 years ago. The newspaper added that Al-Khawahir, who has been in prison ever since, had been sentenced to be surgically paralyzed if he cannot come up with one million Saudi Riyals ($266,000) in compensation to be paid to the victim. Rights groups were quick to condemn the reported sentence, with Amnesty International calling it ""outrageous,"" and adding that it ""should on no account be carried out."" Britian's Foreign Office also issued a statement about the reported sentence, expressing ""deep concern"" and calling the punishment ""grotesque."" This is not the first time a ""paralysis as punishment"" sentence has made headlines in Saudi Arabia. In 2010, local media reported the case of a 22-year-old man who was paralyzed in a fight, saying he had subsequently requested paralysis as punishment for the man he'd fought with. After the initial reports, the Saudi Ministry of Justice denied that paralysis had ever been considered as punishment in that case.","The purported sentence first surfaced in local media last month .

"(CNN) -- Lewis Hamilton realistically can't win the title but the former world champion hopes to challenge powerhouse Sebastian Vettel at the Korean Grand Prix after posting the fastest practice times Friday. Hamilton's time of one minute, 38.673 seconds in the second session in Yeongam was about one-tenth of a second quicker than Vettel, the triple reigning world champion who has captured the last two races in Korea. ""It's the first time I can remember that second practice has really gone well for me,"" Mercedes' Hamilton was quoted as saying by Formula One's website. ""We haven't changed anything but the day just went smoothly and all the processes with the team worked well. I love this track."" Vettel admitted there was ""some room for improvement"" in his Red Bull. ""It will be close with Mercedes,"" he told Formula One's website. ""Of course we're not sure what others were doing with their fuel loads today, but it seems close ahead of tomorrow's qualifying. ""I like the track here, it's a shame it's so far from Seoul, which is a great city, but it's good coming here as it's quieter than some other races, which means we can focus on our job."" The only driver with half-a-chance of catching Vettel, Fernando Alonso, was a distant seventh in the second session. He trails Vettel by 60 points with a mere six races remaining and admitted this week he needed a comeback similar to Oracle Team USA's in the America's Cup sailing to overtake the German. But Alonso didn't sound optimistic Friday. ""There is every probability that, again here, we can expect to struggle in the race,"" Ferrari's Alonso told Formula One's website. ""It won't be easy for us in performance terms, but we know that apart from that, we can do well on Sunday. Now, we must try and get the most out of what we have available and put everything together tomorrow and in the race."" Kimi Raikkonen, Alonso's teammate next season, crashed in the first practice session but was unhurt. Autosport.com quoted the Finn as saying he would take action at the end of the season to fix a lingering back problem.

"(CNN) -- The Texas House of Representatives approved a measure Wednesday that would place broad new restrictions on abortions in the state. A state Senate committee is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to send its version of the bill to the full Senate. The legislation would ban abortions past 20 weeks of gestation, require abortion clinics to become ambulatory surgical centers, tighten usage guidelines for the drug RU486 and require doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they're providing abortion services. The House's move comes two weeks after state Sen. Wendy Davis tried to block the bill with a filibuster, talking for more than 10 hours in an attempt to run out the clock on the legislative session. Gov. Rick Perry called a special session so the legislature could take up the measure again. The measure passed the House on Wednesday with a 98-49 vote after hours of debate over proposed amendments. In Texas, fetal pain factors into abortion debate . Critics said the measure would shut down most abortion clinics in Texas, denying access to many in rural communities, and force women to seek dangerous back alley abortions. Many Democrats, like Rep. Mary Gonzales, felt the motives for the legislation were less than pure. ""Is this bill more about women's health or political futures,"" she asked Tuesday. But for Republicans like Rep. Jason Villalba, the bill's passage was intensely personal. Holding up a sonogram of his 13-week-old son, he voiced his support. ""I will fight, and I will fight, and I will fight to protect my baby,"" he said. Proponents say that the bill is necessary to raise the standard of care for women in Texas and will protect 20-week-old babies at the point that they begin to have the ability to feel pain. On Tuesday, Davis conceded to CNN the abortion legislation was likely to pass this time around. ""It will be very difficult because unfortunately the voices that have been here crying out against this bill are not going to be heard,"" Davis told CNN. ""But I don't think it's the end. It's the beginning of a battle line,"" she added. Federal judge temporarily blocks new Wisconsin abortion law .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. is ""running out of time"" to win the war in Afghanistan, and sending in more troops will not guarantee victory, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Michael Mullen, warned Congress on Wednesday. Adm. Michael Mullen tells a congressional committee Wednesday that the war in Afghanistan is winnable. At the same hearing, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said the conflict in Iraq has entered the ""endgame"" but said that the situation there remains fragile and that U.S. decisions in the coming months ""will be critical to regional stability and our national security interests in the years to come."" Mullen's and Gates' remarks to the House Armed Services Committee came a day after President Bush announced troop reductions in Iraq and the deployment of 4,500 additional troops in Afghanistan. Mullen said he is convinced the Afghanistan war can be won but said the U.S. urgently needs to improve its nation-building initiatives and its cross-border strategy with Pakistan. ""We can't kill our way to victory, and no armed force anywhere -- no matter how good -- can deliver these keys alone. It requires teamwork and cooperation,"" Mullen said. Mullen appeared before the House panel a day before the seventh anniversary of the September 11 attacks, which prompted the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan. Militants have re-established their presence in Afghanistan after U.S. and British troops entered the country in October 2001 and ousted the Taliban government, which was harboring al Qaeda, the terrorist group behind the September 11 attacks. And Mullen said these militants have grown ""bolder."" Cross-border attacks into Afghanistan by militants in Pakistan's tribal region are a problem, and the U.S. has deployed Predator drones to attack targets in Pakistan. Last week, U.S. troops entered Pakistan, a move that prompted condemnation from Islamabad. Mullen stressed that Afghanistan can't be referenced without ""speaking of Pakistan,"" where, he said, the militant groups collaborate and communicate better, launch more sophisticated attacks, employ foreign fighters and use civilians as human shields. ""In my view, these two nations are inextricably linked in a common insurgency that crosses the border between them,"" he said, adding that he plans ""to commission a new, more comprehensive strategy for the region, one that covers both sides of the border. ""I have pressed hard on my counterparts in Pakistan to do more against extremists and to let us do more to help them,"" he said. The conflict is exacerbated, he said, by the ""poor and struggling Afghan economy"" as well as the drug trade and ""significant political uncertainty in Pakistan."" These factors present a ""complex, difficult struggle."" Mullen said that he has urged the ""growth and training"" of Afghan forces and that U.S. military officials recommend the deployment of a Marine battalion this fall and another Army unit early next year, which Bush announced Tuesday. Bush also announced that about 8,000 U.S. troops soon will be coming home from Iraq, and Gates told the committee Wednesday that the ""continuing drawdown is possible because of the success in reducing violence and building Iraqi security capacity."" The U.S. probably will remain in Iraq for years in roles that will change and become more limited over time, he said. ""Even with fewer U.S. troops in Iraq, the positive trends of the last year have held and in some cases steadily continued in the right direction,"" Gates said. ""Our casualties have been greatly reduced -- even though one is too many -- and overall violence is down."" Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Missouri, the committee's chairman, asked whether Iraq remains the higher priority. The defense secretary said he doesn't think importance can be conveyed in a ""mathematical equation."" ""I would say success in Iraq means we are steadily reducing our commitment -- our level of commitment and resources, particularly manpower -- for that theater,"" Gates said. ""At the same time we are able, under those circumstances, to increase our level of commitment and resources to Afghanistan."" Mullen said both conflicts are high priorities. As for Afghanistan, the imminent deployments are not enough for now, but they represent ""a good start,"" Mullen said. There are more than 30,000 U.S. troops under coalition and NATO commands in Afghanistan. ""Frankly, I judge the risk of not sending them too great a risk to ignore. My expectation is that they will need to perform both the training mission and combat and combat support missions simultaneously until such time that we can provide additional troops. I cannot at this point say when that might be,"" he said. He said he's confident that Afghan security forces can be trained and developed. ""In fact, they are on track to reach a total end strength of 162,000 troops by 2010. The Marines conducting their training are doing a phenomenal job,"" he said. At the same time, Mullen warned ""that no amount of troops in no amount of time can ever achieve all the objectives we seek."" Until Afghan security forces gain the backing of local leaders to improve security, ""we will only be as much as a crutch, and a temporary one at that,"" the admiral said. ""We can hunt down and kill extremists as they cross over the border from Pakistan, as I watched us do during a daylong trip to the Korengal Valley in July. But until we work more closely with the Pakistani government to eliminate the safe havens from which they operate, the enemy will only keep coming,"" he said. Mullen also said roads, schools and courts can be built and repaired, but that work is not enough, either. Afghanistan needs more experts in commerce, agriculture, jurisprudence and education. The nation also needs ""foreign investment, alternative crops, sound governance and the rule of law."" Until then, Mullen said, these institutions ""will remain but empty shells.""","NEW: Defense secretary says Iraq enters ""endgame,"" warns of fragile progress .

"(CNN) -- Horrific events, such as the massacre in Aurora, can be catalysts for social and political change. Sometimes it seems that they're the only catalyst; recall how drastically our policies toward terrorism changed after 9/11 despite how moribund they were before. The problem is that fear can cloud our reasoning, causing us to overreact and to overly focus on the specifics. And the key is to steer our desire for change in that time of fear. Our brains aren't very good at probability and risk analysis. We tend to exaggerate spectacular, strange and rare events, and downplay ordinary, familiar and common ones. We think rare risks are more common than they are. We fear them more than probability indicates we should. There is a lot of psychological research that tries to explain this, but one of the key findings is this: People tend to base risk analysis more on stories than on data. Stories engage us at a much more visceral level, especially stories that are vivid, exciting or personally involving. When it's not 'only a movie' If a friend tells you about getting mugged in a foreign country, that story is more likely to affect how safe you feel traveling to that country than reading a page of abstract crime statistics will. Novelty plus dread plus a good story equals overreaction. And who are the major storytellers these days? Television and the Internet. So when news programs and sites endlessly repeat the story from Aurora, with interviews with those in the theater, interviews with the families and commentary by anyone who has a point to make, we start to think this is something to fear, rather than a rare event that almost never happens and isn't worth worrying about. In other words, reading five stories about the same event feels somewhat like five separate events, and that skews our perceptions. We see the effects of this all the time. It's strangers by whom we fear being murdered, kidnapped, raped and assaulted, when it's far more likely that any perpetrator of such offenses is a relative or a friend. We worry about airplane crashes and rampaging shooters instead of automobile crashes and domestic violence -- both of which are far more common and far, far more deadly. Our greatest recent overreaction to a rare event was our response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11. I remember then-Attorney General John Ashcroft giving a speech in Minnesota -- where I live -- in 2003 in which he claimed that the fact there were no new terrorist attacks since 9/11 was proof that his policies were working. I remember thinking: ""There were no terrorist attacks in the two years preceding 9/11, and you didn't have any policies. What does that prove?"" What it proves is that terrorist attacks are very rare, and perhaps our national response wasn't worth the enormous expense, loss of liberty, attacks on our Constitution and damage to our credibility on the world stage. Still, overreacting was the natural thing for us to do. Yes, it was security theater and not real security, but it made many of us feel safer. The rarity of events such as the Aurora massacre doesn't mean we should ignore any lessons it might teach us. Because people overreact to rare events, they're useful catalysts for social introspection and policy change. The key here is to focus not on the details of the particular event but on the broader issues common to all similar events. Opinion: Average Americans don't need assault weapons . Installing metal detectors at movie theaters doesn't make sense -- there's no reason to think the next crazy gunman will choose a movie theater as his venue, and how effectively would a metal detector deter a lone gunman anyway? -- but understanding the reasons why the United States has so many gun deaths compared with other countries does. The particular motivations of alleged killer James Holmes aren't relevant -- the next gunman will have different motivations -- but the general state of mental health care in the United States is. Even with this, the most important lesson of the Aurora massacre is how rare these events actually are. Our brains are primed to believe that movie theaters are more dangerous than they used to be, but they're not. The riskiest part of the evening is still the car ride to and from the movie theater, and even that's very safe. But wear a seat belt all the same. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bruce Schneier .","Bruce Schneier: When horrific events happen, we look for lessons .
He says people aren't good about understanding probabilities and often exaggerate risks .
Schneier: After 9/11, policies were adopted that caused enormous expense and damage .
He says lessons can be learned if we look at patterns among many events ."
"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Doctors gave Anna Nicole Smith a long list of dangerous drugs over the three years before her death, including while she was pregnant, according to sworn statements by investigators from state agencies. Dosages prescribed to Anna Nicole Smith were ""dangerously high,"" a drug expert says in an affidavit. Two doctors charged in connection with Smith's death allegedly also crossed professional lines by having personal relationships with their patient, the court documents released Tuesday said. Smith died in a Hollywood, Florida, hotel on February 8, 2007, of what was later ruled to be ""acute combined drug intoxication."" One affidavit quoted a pharmacist who refused to fill a prescription written for Smith as saying he warned one doctor he would not give her the drug ""unless you want your picture on the front page of the National Enquirer."" One investigator described the former Playboy model and reality show TV star as a ""drug seeker."" Her boyfriend, Howard K. Stern, and two doctors -- Dr. Khristine Eroshevich and Dr. Sandeep Kapoor -- were charged with several felonies, including conspiring to furnish controlled substances, unlawfully prescribing a controlled substance and obtaining fraudulent prescriptions from June 2004 through January 2007. All three defendants entered not-guilty pleas in May. A preliminary hearing is set for next month in the case. Smith, whose real name was Vickie Lynn Marshall, ""was given drugs in excessive amounts,"" according to a medical expert consulted and quoted by a state medical board investigator. Dr. Jill Klessig also told an investigator that ""in addition to the prescribing issues, there appears to have been a personal relationship"" between Smith and the two doctors that crossed the boundaries of professionalism. The affidavit references a video clip of Kapoor ""kissing and snuggling"" with Smith ""in a reclined position in a nightclub setting."" Eroshevich traveled to the Bahamas to visit Smith and was with her for four days in Hollywood, Florida, four days before her death, an investigator said in an affidavit. The doctor personally visited a Burbank, California, pharmacy in September 2006 to get a sleep aid -- chloral hydrate -- for Smith to use in the Bahamas. It was just four days after Smith gave birth to a daughter in Nassau. ""I wouldn't give her chloral hydrate unless you want your picture on the front page of the National Enquirer,"" pharmacist Steve Mazlin told Eroshevich, according to the affidavit. The affidavit from Jon Genens, a senior investigator with the California medical board, detailed dozens of prescriptions written for Smith -- under several aliases -- for a long list of narcotics and sleep aids. Genens said even during the time she was pregnant -- starting in January 2006 -- Kapoor prescribed an average of 10 tablets of Methadone per day for Smith. He noted that Kapoor lowered the dosage in the last three months of her pregnancy. The volume of dangerous drugs being ordered by doctors spurred the chief pharmacist at the store where most of the prescriptions were filled to call a drug expert for advice in late 2006, according to a sworn statement by California Department of Justice Special Agent Jennifer Doss. Dr. Greg Thompson told Doss he recalled the dosages were ""dangerously high."" ""Dr. Thompson stated they might work for a drug addict under supervised care, or with a dying cancer patient in a hospital, or 'if you were going to kill someone,' "" Doss said. Thompson told Doss he later ""admonished Dr. Eroshevich"" about the drugs she was requesting for Smith. ""Dr. Thompson stated Dr. Eroshevich was obviously not familiar with a lot of medications she was prescribing for ... Smith,"" Doss said in her affidavit. The Doss affidavit said the doctor used Smith's boyfriend as a cover to get the prescriptions filled. ""Of the 12 medications found in Anna Nicole Smith's hotel room at the time of her death, seven medications were prescribed the name of Howard K. Stearn [believed to be Howard K. Stern] by Dr. Eroshevich,"" Agent Doss said. The drugs were apparently personally delivered to Smith in the Bahamas and Florida by her doctor, Doss said. ""It is reasonable to believe that Dr. Eroshevich provided Anna Nicole Smith prescription medications and controlled substances by transporting them from California to Nassau, Bahamas with her on her travels to visit Anna Nicole Smith,"" Doss said.","NEW: Doctors' relationships with Smith crossed professional lines, affidavits say .

"Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- The only leader that the independent Zimbabwe has ever known will be at the helm for another five years, following an election that pitted 89-year-old President Robert Mugabe against his longtime foe, Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai. Mugabe was elected to his seventh term as president with 61% of Wednesday's vote, the head of the country's Election Commission said Saturday. Tsvangirai, who won 34%, according to the election commission, has alleged widespread fraud and was quick to promise a court challenge. ""A fraudulent and a stolen election has plunged Zimbabwe into a constitutional, political and economic crisis,"" said Tsvangirai, 61. The commission also announced that Mugabe's ZANU-PF party won a two-thirds majority in parliament. Election observers and foreign officials raised doubts Saturday about the way the election was conducted, though some of them noted it was peaceful -- in contrast to the last election, in 2008, where post-vote violence left at last 200 people dead and thousands injured. Fast Facts: Robert Mugabe . The Southern African Development Community deployed 573 observers to all 10 of the country's provinces and ""observed that in general voting took place in a free and peaceful environment"" and that election commission staffers ""conducted themselves professionally."" But it noted areas of concern. The African Union, which also sent observers, praised Zimbabwe for holding peaceful elections. It made no mention of rigging allegations but noted shortcomings, saying some voters were turned away, polling stations published their tallies late and members of the media took sides. Even so, the AU said, ""The mission observes generally, that from a historical perspective and in comparison to the 2008 elections, Zimbabwe has made an important transition in the conduct of its elections."" Tsvangirai's party, the Movement for Democratic Change, issued a statement saying it expects the African Union and SADC to ""meet urgently to deal with this crisis in order to restore constitutional, political and legal legitimacy in the country."" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, in a statement Saturday, criticized ""the culmination of a deeply flawed process."" ""In light of substantial irregularities reported by domestic and regional observers, the United States does not believe the results announced today represent a credible expression of the will of the Zimbabwean people,"" Kerry said. British Foreign Secretary William Hague, meanwhile, commended the peaceful nature of the vote, but expressed concern over how it was conducted. Citing the AU and SADC statements, he said, ""I hope that their final assessments of the elections will take into account the full impact of these irregularities on the outcome."" The reported irregularities ""call into serious question the credibility of the election,"" Hague said. With his controversial win, Mugabe is set to see his time in power extended to 38 years. Who is Robert Mugabe? Mugabe helped form the Republic of Zimbabwe after the British rule of Rhodesia came to an end in 1980, and after elections that year, he served as Zimbabwe's first prime minister for seven years. After a new constitution in 1987 replaced the office of prime minister with an executive president, Zimbabwe's national assembly elected Mugabe to a four-year term as president. Elections in 1990, 1996 and 2002 all saw Mugabe win successive six-year terms. Beginning in the 1990s, Mugabe began to alienate himself from the international community by forcing white farmers to give up their land for redistribution to black Zimbabweans. Farm output later decreased sharply amid a famine in the country, and Human Rights Watch accused Mugabe's government of using starvation as a tool to gain voter support. The European Union and the United States imposed sanctions on Mugabe and members of his party amid reports of human rights violations. In 2003, Mugabe withdrew the country from the Commonwealth. Fast Facts: Morgan Tsvangirai . Tsvangirai ran unsuccessfully against Mugabe in 2002 and was later arrested several times, jailed on charges of treason and severely beaten in police custody. He faced off against Mugabe in the last election and won more votes than the president, though not enough to avoid a runoff. Violence broke out, and Tsvangirai then pulled out of the runoff claiming widespread voter intimidation and the torture, mutilation and murder of his supporters. Months later, after international pressure and successful negotiations, Mugabe and Tsvangirai signed an agreement giving Tsvangirai the post of prime minister in a Mugabe-led government. It has been an uneasy coalition ever since, one that included a brief boycott of the coalition by the MDC over the arrest of a party leader. Journalist Columbus S. Mavhunga reported this story from Harare, and Faith Karimi reported and wrote from London.","Tsvangirai to challenge the results in court .

"(CNN) -- Non-contagious meningitis struck 14 patients -- all but one in Tennessee -- who received steroid injections, leaving two dead, according to health officials investigating the outbreak. Thirteen of the victims -- in their late 40s to their early 80s -- received injections at a Nashville medical facility, Woody McMillin, spokesman for the Tennessee Department of Health, told CNN on Tuesday. The 14th individual contracted the illness in an unspecified state. ""This is a serious disease,"" said Marion Kainer, an infectious disease expert with the state health department. ""There is not a lot of experience in treating this, but we are getting the best experts together."" The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are among the agencies investigating the rare form of meningitis. Eleven of the patients are hospitalized, McMillin told CNN. St. Thomas Outpatient Neurosurgery Center in Nashville contacted 737 patients who had lumbar epidural steroid injections between July 30 and September 20, officials said. The facility was temporarily closed on September 20 and will remain closed until investigating authorities ""are confident the current concerns have been resolved,"" the health department said. Between 100 and 200 patients at Specialty Surgery Center in Crossville, Tennessee, may have been exposed or at risk because of lumbar injections during the same time period, according to McMillin. Some of the patients may have had multiple procedures. Meningitis is a general term for an infection or inflammatory process involving the lining of the brain and central nervous system.","14 patients develop meningitis after receiving steroid injections .

"(CNN) -- Some 3.5 million people fled their homes in Oklahoma, Texas, and elsewhere, the bone-dry landscape, blistering heat and choking dust storms unfit for growing and raising the crops and cattle they relied on to survive. Thousands more, many of them children and seniors, could not escape, killed by an infection dubbed ""dust pneumonia"" and other illnesses tied not just to the extreme weather and poor living conditions but to massive, fast-moving dust clouds. Those clouds and barren terrain across much of middle America gave this period of despair its name: the Dust Bowl. There were suicides, there were bankruptcies, there were people scrapping for whatever they could find to live. And these were not overnight horror stories: They were repeated day after day and year after year, at a time when much of the United States and world was already debilitated by the Great Depression. ""If you can imagine what's happening now and multiply it by a factor of four or five, that's what it was like,"" said Bill Ganzel, a Nebraska-based media producer who interviewed survivors of the 1930s' environmental and economic disaster and penned a book, ""Dust Bowl Descent."" ""And it lasted for the entire decade."" From dry rivers to dead deer, drought's impact felt everywhere . Nothing in U.S. history can compare to that calamity of eight decades ago, including the historic drought now gripping much of the country. That doesn't mean, though, there isn't considerable suffering and devastation now in most of the United States. Or that dire conditions could well persist for several years, as they did during the 1930s -- compounding negative impacts of drought, thus ruining even more livelihoods and lives despite technological and agricultural advancements of recent years. ""Mother Nature holds all the cards,"" said Mark Svoboda, a climatologist with the National Drought Mitigation Center. ""You roll the dice ... every year. Nothing will make you quote-unquote drought-proof."" This year, Hurricane Isaac helped alleviate the current drought in some locales, but not in most, and certainly nowhere near enough to put a big dent in a phenomenon that's affected millions. Is it happening again? Over 63% of the contiguous United States in early September was suffering moderate to exceptional drought, nearly twice the land affected a year ago, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Using July data, the National Climatic Data Center reported that America is in the midst of its most expansive drought since December 1956. The combination of dry conditions and extreme heat -- including hundreds of record-breaking temperatures this summer -- has been unbearable for many. The drought's impact has been seen in ways big and small, from leaves falling early and lawns turning brown to farmers giving up and lakes drying up, exposing hundreds of dead fish. ""It does look like a moonscape,"" Svoboda said of parts of western Oklahoma, where dirt drifts into mounds and soil climbs over fence posts. ""There are some parts of the country where (dire farming conditions) have nothing to do with them failing to till over the soil,"" as was commonly blamed for ""dust storms"" of the 1930s. LIFE.com photos: Dust Bowl survivors, Oklahoma, 1942 . Driving through southern Wisconsin, CNN iReporter Jim Jostad saw heap after heap of chopped-down corn sacrificed by farmers who had conceded this year's crop, hoping if anything to salvage some of the loss by selling off as cattle feed what did sprout up. Dozens of farmers markets in Oklahoma were without vendors months earlier than had been expected because their bounty was so meager, said Nathan Kirby of the state's Department of Agriculture, a year after closing even earlier due to similarly hot, arid conditions. While consumers may be worried about rising food prices tied to the drought, many farmers have seen their incomes all but evaporate because crops won't grow -- finding even irrigated farmlands cannot pump in enough moisture, given the rate it evaporates back into the atmosphere in high heat. It hasn't been easier for those who raising cattle and other animals, at a time of scorched pastures and scanty, costly hay and other feed. Ranchers have been forced to prematurely sell off their cattle, saying they had no other choice because it cost more to feed them than to keep them. Oklahoma ranchers ""liquidated"" -- meaning slaughtered or sold off, without replacing them with newborns or new purchases -- 14% of their livestock last year, said Derrell Peel, an Oklahoma State University faculty member who works with ranchers and affiliated companies in that state. The only reason rates haven't been similarly high after this summer is because ranchers don't have as many animals to sell, he said. Families trying to make a living raising cattle have been especially hard pressed. Take Mark Argall of Mountain Grove, Missouri, who sold 33 of his cherished cows (leaving only a few behind) for less than half what they might have earned before the drought. ""They're not just numbers on a computer,"" Argall said. ""They're members of the family."" Can it happen again? So what can be done to prevent another Dust Bowl disaster? Rains from Hurricane Isaac might have made headlines, but they alone won't make a dent in the drought. Ironically, the Dust Bowl era had wet spells, too -- including flash floods in the Great Plains -- though they did not alter the devastating equation much, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture meteorologist Brad Rippey. What farmers and ranchers do have working in their favor, compared to the 1930s, are new tools, techniques and other developments that help them better manage droughts, storms and other harsh weather realities. Photos: Drought around the world . Svoboda, with the National Drought Mitigation Center, rattles off several such changes -- from more effective soil preservation measures to hybrid seeds to the inception of center pivot irrigation. He adds, too, that things like cell phones and computers make it easier for farmers, ranchers and others to understand what's coming, then adjust. And the most significant difference between the 1930s and today -- and the main reason for hope that it won't be as bad -- is time. The Dust Bowl era is generally defined as an eight-year stretch; while parts of Oklahoma and Texas are in the second year of drought, the rest of the United States is in its first. In other words, there's still a long way to go. If the precipitation picks up, ""row farmers"" cultivating crops like corn, soy beans and sorghum using modern farming practices should be able to recover next year. ""If they have a normal rain pattern, it's basically a zero recovery period,"" said Rippey. ""You are going from a (devastated) 2012 crop to normal."" But those raising livestock may feel the effects of this drought for longer, even if there's more rain. Some strained pastureland and hay fields may revive with above average, more sustained rainfalls than ordinary. But other lands may be a lost cause, with replanting the only way to save them. Peel called the next one to two months ""critical,"" as some rain soon may help save these lands so ranchers do not have to start from scratch. Still, even if their pastures improve or hay prices drop, those who sold off many of their livestock in recent years likely cannot afford to buy the same number back, and return to normal, anytime soon. ""Grazing and ranching are totally at the mercy of rain-fed crops and pastures,"" said Svoboda, pointing especially to the susceptibility of grass and hay to a lack of moisture and excess of heat. ""They just don't control those factors at all."" If drought conditions do persist, they can have a steamroller effect. ""The suns' rays are more efficient (when) you have parched soils,"" said Rippey, the USDA meteorologist, adding that it becomes harder for new moisture to make an immediate impact. ""These droughts, when they tend to go multiple years, it really starts to feed on itself,"" adds Svoboda. Girl from iconic Dust Bowl photo: 'We were ashamed' We haven't got there quite yet, but we could be if more precipitation doesn't fall over the Great Plains and beyond. As they try to predict the drought's future, meteorologists say they will look first to whether this fall and winter are wetter and cooler than last year, hoping that it will saturate soils and rivers and spur a wetter trend that continues into next spring and summer. As is, some states out west had two straight La Nina winters that ""tend to really suck you dry,"" Svoboda explained. Typically lasting a year or two, La Nina is characterized by cooler than normal sea-surface temperatures in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean that has a domino effect on global weather -- leading to more rainfall than normal in some locales and drought in others. ""If we had a third consecutive La Nina, there are some statistics that would be scary,"" he added. ""But the odds of La Nina (continuing) are very small right now."" Still, no one predicted practically a full decade of minimal rain, maximum heat during the Dust Bowl era either. The fact is, for all the forecasts and farming innovations, keeping one's fingers crossed for change in the weather may be as useful as anything else. ""Right now, it's just a question of Mother Nature giving us a break,"" said Derrell Peel, from Oklahoma State.

"New York (CNN) -- Robbie Wilde thumbs through his iPhone as the sounds of voices and clinking glasses bounce all around him. His eyes never leave the phone's screen. During New York Fashion Week, Wilde, 27, passes the time with friends and management at an exclusive party in Hell's Kitchen before taking over the turntables. Wilde lives in a world of rhythm and bass. He just can't hear it. Ear infections at age 7 left Wilde completely deaf in his right ear and took away 80% of his hearing in his left one. It would be another four years before doctors would confirm what his mother, Maria Sapeta, dreaded: Her son was deaf. ""It was heartbreaking as a mother,"" she recalled. ""It was probably one of the hardest days of my life. But Robbie was the one who gave me a hug and said, 'Don't cry.'"" Originally from Portugal, Sapeta and her husband, Emidio, then a cruise ship chef, had moved to the United States when Wilde was 5. From childhood, he always had a ""persistent personality,"" Sapeta said, laughing. Unlike many other kids his age, he always finished what he started -- from puzzles to cabins made from Lincoln Logs. After losing his hearing, his grades slipped because he had difficulty understanding his teachers. Bullied in school, Wilde usually kept his deafness a secret. When his parents suggested he attend a specialty school, he insisted on staying in public school. He worked with a speech therapist and began reading lips. ""I grew up in a way that I don't want any sympathy. I don't want to be treated differently,"" he said. ""I just tried to maneuver around, reading lips and trying to hear my own way."" When her son announced he wanted to be a professional DJ instead of joining the family restaurant business, Sapeta was cautiously supportive. ""We could see his talent and his passion, but I kept worrying about that left ear,"" she said. ""Anything to stop his dreams, he didn't want it."" Hearing is the most important sense for a DJ, who manipulates music, scratches records and uses mixers. But Wilde was determined to succeed without his. Always drawn to music, he discovered turntables in high school through a friend's brother who was a DJ. Wilde got his first shot at performing as a DJ at his father's restaurant outside Newark, New Jersey, nearly a decade ago, and he hasn't looked back since. ""I still consider it as a hobby. I really do love it,"" Wilde said. ""I don't see it as a job, and that's the best part."" Wilde started out playing CDs before pushing himself to scratch records, something he knew he needed help with. ""It's a hard business alone for the hearing community,"" he said, ""And I was like, 'I'm hearing impaired and how's that going to work?'"" So he paired up with two-time DMC world champion DJ and Harvard math grad Sam Zornow, aka DJ Shiftee, who was teaching at Dubspot, a DJ school and production studio in New York. Mastering turntables is a skill that takes hours of practice to learn and can be a lifelong pursuit, Zornow said. ""It takes two years just to get bad,"" he said. ""And I mean 'bad' meaning bad."" Still, Zornow was up to the challenge of working with Wilde. At first he didn't know what to expect, but he said Wilde's success has surprised him. ""On paper it should be impossible. You're dealing with manipulating sound. Then combine that with a discipline that's hard in general, it's a really impressive task he's taken on,"" Zornow said. ""From the beginning he believed in himself and continues to believe in himself."" Computer giant Hewlett-Packard noticed Wilde's skills and put him in a commercial this fall for its new touch-enabled PC, thrusting him onto the world stage. (watch it here on YouTube) ""It's a true story of inspiration,"" said HP marketing executive Danielle Jones. ""His is a profound story of someone being able to do the things that matter to them and the things that they love through technology."" Unable to hear lyrics or complete compositions, Wilde relies on technology to see the music by using his laptop and DJ software that helps him differentiate between vocals, bass and kicks. He also feels the vibration whether physically from a club's speakers or through a SubPac, which resembles a seat cushion and allows him to feel the music by directly transferring low frequencies to the body. Clubgoers and promoters dubbed him ""That Deaf DJ"" after he first came onto the scene in New Jersey -- a moniker even he uses. But Wilde said he wants to be more than just ""a deaf kid trying to DJ."" ""I want you to see me as a great DJ who happens to be deaf,"" he said. Besides, he said, some things are better left unheard. ""There's a lot of sounds out in the world you don't want to hear. I like it muffled,"" he said. ""I like who I am; I'm proud of who I am."" Wilde has gone from working small clubs to rocking this year's Consumer Electronics Show and Sundance Film Festival. When he's not behind the turntables, Wilde is in the studio producing music. Often questioned about the severity of his deafness, Wilde used to carry around a doctor's note and would show the back of his driver's license indicating his hearing impairment. When people question his abilities, he said he has only one answer: ""I didn't hear you.""","Robbie Wilde lost his hearing due to ear infections as a child .

"(CNN) -- Liverpool climbed back to the top of the Premier League Monday -- but it was made to sweat during a pulsating 2-2 draw with Swansea City. Liverpool, who had boasted a 100% record going into the contest after winning all three of its league games, sits one point clear of Arsenal and Tottenham following the draw in south Wales. Jonjo Shelvey, the man who left Liverpool for Swansea in July following a $5 million move, was in the thick of the action from the very start. Gift . It took Shelvey just two minutes to fire Swansea ahead from close range before his mistake gifted Daniel Sturridge an equalizer soon after. Another poor pass from Shelvey allowed Liverpool's on-loan winger Victor Moses to fire the Merseysiders in front nine minutes before the break. But the 21-year-old made amends in the second half, linking up with Michu, who fired home past Simon Mignolet for his first league goal of the season. Sorry . Swansea might have even won it late on but Liverpool held out for a point, although Shelvey felt his side should have had more. ""I just want to say sorry to the Swansea fans for the two bad mistakes that gifted Liverpool a draw,"" Shelvey told Sky Sports. ""You just want to go into a hole where nobody can see you when you give the ball away for the other team to score, but it has happened to great players over time. ""I showed a bit of character to keep getting on the ball. I still feel I have given Liverpool a draw but it was a great game to play in."" Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, who left Swansea to take up the reins at Anfield in June 2012, revealed his relief after a hard fought encounter. ""I thought for the first 65 minutes we were very, very good with and without the ball. We had to show character after going behind so early,""he told Sky Sports. ""This will be a really big point for us."" Totti . In Italy, Francesco Totti scored his first goal of the season as Roma claimed a third consecutive victory to maintain its perfect start to the season. Totti, playing in his 22nd season with the club, helped Roma come from a goal down to defeat Parma 3-1 and join Napoli at the top of the table on nine points. Parma had taken the lead six minute before the break when Jonathan Biabany headed home from close range. But the visiting side hit back two minutes after the restart through Alessandro Florenzi before new signing Kevin Strootman set up Totti to score.

"(CNN) -- It may be a year away, but the mind games have already begun in the Ryder Cup. In a news conference at Gleneagles in Scotland -- next fall's venue for the biennial golf clash -- U.S. captain Tom Watson couldn't resist putting his European counterpart, Paul McGinley, on the spot. In discussing how Ryder Cup teams should be selected, Watson suggested both sides should lose the right to pick some of the squad -- at the moment the majority qualify through prize money on their respective tours but the captain is allowed to choose a handful of golfers. ""In my first three Ryder Cups everyone had to qualify,"" said Watson, a winner of eight majors. ""Maybe that's the way it should go back to. I reduced my picks this year from four to three. I thought about two. ""Maybe we should go back to no picks. What do you think?"" Watson asked McGinley in front of dozens of journalists. It was a mischievous question, since most believe such a system would favor the Americans because many of the European stars now ply their trade on the U.S. PGA Tour. McGinley saw it coming. ""That would be tricky for us with so many of our players playing on the U.S. tour,"" he said. ""Question deferred."" The exchange, carried out with big smiles, was in keeping with the way both captains say they want the sport's most prestigious team competition to be played. ""We know this is a partisan event, we are on away turf, and the European team is the favorite, but one thing Paul and I agreed on was the manner in which this tournament is played is paramount, "" Watson said. ""There's going to be an edge there, but the way we handle it is important . ""Bottom line, it requires respect. When you lose you respect the people who win, when you win you respect the people who lose."" One thing, though, neither captain wants is the tag of favorite. Unfortunately for McGinley, he won't win that battle. The Europeans have won two straight and five of the last six Ryder Cups, including last year's 'Miracle in Medinah.' The U.S. led 10-6 heading into the final day, only to lose 14.5 to 13.5. ""The bookies will say we are favorites,"" McGinley said. ""I've no reason to argue with the bookies. ""But the margin is so small. We are going to play incredibly well. The American team under Tom Watson is going to be a formidable package. It's a real heavyweight contest."" Watson eased the pressure on the road team. ""We have lost seven out of the last nine Ryder Cups,"" Watson said. ""We have an away game. In traditional sport the home team has an advantage."" Watson's involvement as captain might, however, be a factor. He was a Ryder Cup stalwart and is 1-0 as captain, leading the U.S. to victory at the Belfry in England in 1993 -- the last time the U.S. won on foreign soil. Watson also prospered in Britain, capturing five British Opens. ""I am very grateful for the opportunity to be captain in Scotland, a place that has been very special to me during my career,"" said Watson. ""It's hard to believe that it was nearly 20 years ago that I enjoyed one of the most thrilling experiences in my career in being captain in 1993.""","U.S. Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson floats the idea of doing away with captain's picks .

"(CNN) -- McLaren may want a reunion with Fernando Alonso, but the Spaniard has no intention of leaving Ferrari. On a frantic Friday at the Singapore Grand Prix, McLaren chief Martin Whitmarsh announced he wanted to bring Alonso back to the team he drove for during the 2007 season. When asked directly if he wanted to recruit Alonso, Whitmarsh responded: ""Yes - any team would. He's the best driver."" ""I don't know his contractual situation. I assume he's under contract."" But any hopes McLaren had of luring Alonso back were quickly quashed, with the two-time world champion declaring he saw his long-term future with Ferrari. ""I keep repeating every weekend -- and I don't know why I have to keep repeating -- I love Ferrari and I will stay in Ferrari until the end,"" the 32-year-old told Sky Sports News. ""It is nice to have the comments from the other team principals every year saying they respect my job and my professionalism -- especially McLaren as there were so many rumors that we had a lot of problems that year. ""But I always say that I had no problems with anyone, it was just the philosophy of the team or rather one man in the team that is no longer there. Interactive: Singapore set to light up F1 . ""It is good to have these comments, but I have no intention (to leave). I have three more years with Ferrari and I hope many more to come if we can extend the contract and that will be my hope."" Two-time world champion Alonso has been with Ferrari since 2010, but his position as the team's undisputed No. 1 driver has been called into question following the announcement Finn Kimi Raikkonen will race for the Italian manufacturer in 2014. Alonso was also given a dressing down by Ferrari chairman Luca di Montezemolo for appearing to criticize the team's car earlier in the season. McLaren's current drivers are Mexican Sergio Perez given that Jenson Button . Alonso's solitary season with McLaren was a turbulent one, with in-fighting damaging team unity as both the Spaniard and rookie driver Lewis Hamilton challenged for the world championship. The 2007 title instead went to Raikkonen, who was racing for Ferrari, by one point. Raikkonen's return to Ferrari on a two-year deal was confirmed last week, with the current Lotus driver replacing outgoing Brazilian Felipe Massa. Alonso is desperate to win a world title with F1's most successful team, but has been thwarted by Red Bull's triple world champion Sebastian Vettel and a car which has at times been uncompetitive. Alonso sits second in the drivers' standings, 53 points behind current leader Vettel after 12 races of the 2014 season.","McLaren want to resign former driver Fernando Alonso .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A dancer-choreographer befriended by Michael Jackson when he was a child now calls the late pop icon ""a pedophile and a child sexual abuser."" Wade Robson, who is seeking money from Jackson's estate for alleged child sex abuse, talked about his claims Thursday on NBC's ""Today"" show. Robson, now 30, denied in testimony at Jackson's child molestation trial in 2005 that he had been molested by the singer. Two months after Jackson's death in 2009, Robson said they had ""a wonderful relationship"" and he called Jackson ""a kind human being."" ""This is not a case of repressed memory,"" Robson told ""Today's"" Matt Lauer. ""I never forgot one moment of what Michael did to me, but I was psychologically and emotionally completely unable and unwilling to understand that it was sexual abuse.

""Mr. Robson has adamantly denied under oath and in numerous interviews over the past 20 years that Michael Jackson ever did anything inappropriate to him,"" Jackson estate attorney Howard Weitzman said. ""He now wants us to believe that he committed perjury at least twice and has been lying to anyone and everyone about Mr. Jackson since the early '90s so he can file a claim for money. Â Mr. Robson's transparent lawsuit comes nearly four years after Michael passed.""Â . The accusation came in the form of a creditor's claim against the estate in a Los Angeles probate court this month. Jackson defender files sex abuse claim . Robson said the abuse started when he was 7-years-old, when he often visited Jackson's Neverland Ranch. It continued until he was 14, he said. ""He performed sexual acts on me and forced me to perform sexual acts on him,"" Robson said. Jackson was acquitted of child molestation charges in 2005, partly based on the testimony of Robson, his sister and his mother. ""It's absurd,"" said Tom Mesereau, the lawyer who successfully defended Jackson in the trial. ""He was one of the strongest witnesses for the defense at Michael Jackson's criminal trial in 2005. He was adamant under oath that he had never been molested at any time."" Robson said his denial to investigators during a 1993 criminal investigation was the result of Jackson's ""complete manipulation and brainwashing"" of him. He denied Jackson ever offered money to keep him quiet. ""He would call me every day and role play and tell me the same sort of things and also tell me then that if anyone ever thought that we did these things, any of these sexual things, that both of us would go to jail for the rest of our lives,"" he said. Robson met Jackson in his native Australia when he was just 5. Jackson invited him for frequent stays at Neverland after Robson and his family moved to Los Angeles two years later. Their visits continued until he was 13, according to court testimony. Choreographer: AEG considered 'pulling the plug' on Jackson's comeback . ""From day one of the abuse, Michael told me that we loved each other and that this was love, that this was an expression of our love. And then you follow that up with 'but if you ever tell anyone what we're doing, both of our lives and our career will be over,'"" he told Lauer. Robson paid tribute to Jackson In an interview with ""Entertainment Tonight"" to promote his choreography work on the MTV Video Music Awards in August 2009. ""I just had a wonderful relationship,"" he said. ""I learned so much from him, as an artist and as a kind human being, and it's my goal to just try and continue as much as I can in my own little world that legacy. ""We talk so much about him as the pop legend, which is important, but it's nice to remember that he was a man, that he was a father,"" Robson said. ""And that's what it's really about is a father and his children, and he was a wonderful dad."" But it was becoming a father himself two and a half years ago that caused Robson to change his story about Jackson, he said. He said he ""collapsed into two nervous breakdowns, terrifying nervous breakdowns"" in his son's first 18 months. ""At that point I had no idea what was wrong with me, what was going on,"" he said. ""During the second one, this thing happened where I started looking at him and imagining him being a victim of the sexual abuse that I was at the hands of Michael. For the first time in my life, I began to realize that my completely numb and unexplored feelings in relationship to what Michael did to me might be a problem and maybe I need to speak to someone about it."" The accusations created a major stir among Jackson fans, many calling Robson a traitor to the man who made his career. They argue his motivation is money from Jackson's estate. ""I understand completely how hard it is to understand this,"" he said. ""That being said, the idea that I would make all of this up and put myself, my wife, my son, my entire family through this extremely stressful and painful experience all for the sake of money is completely incomprehensible."" Witness: 'Everybody was lying' after Jackson died . Robson said the court claim is about healing. ""I've lived in silence and denial for 22 years, and I can't spend another moment in that,"" he said. ""In order to truly heal I have to speak my truth and speak the whole truth. That's one thing you'll never see from me. I'm never going to go away with this for the sake of money. I'm never going to be silenced for money. That's not going to happen."" Lauer asked Robson what comes to mind now when he thinks of Michael Jackson. ""Heartbreak, pain, anger and compassion,"" he said. ""There's no excuse for what he did to me and I believe many others, but he was a troubled man and every effect has its cause. The image that one presents to the world is not the whole explanation of who someone is. Michael Jackson was, yes, an incredibly talented artist with an incredible gift. He was many things. And he was also a pedophile and a child sexual abuser."" The 2005 trial in Santa Barbara County, California, centered on charges that Jackson had molested a 13-year-old cancer survivor who often visited his ranch. He was also charged with plying the boy with alcohol and conspiring to abduct, extort and falsely imprison the child and his family. He was acquitted on all counts. ""I've known Michael for a long time. I've spent many hours talking to him about everything. I trust him. I trust him with my children,"" Joy Robson, the mother of Wade Robson, testified when called as a prosecution witness.

"(CNN) -- The remains of Tropical Storm Karen drifted over the northern Gulf of Mexico after the former cyclone fizzled out Sunday morning, forecasters reported. After being downgraded from a tropical storm to a depression overnight, Karen broke up into disorganized remnants south of Louisiana, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said. Top sustained winds had fallen to about 30 mph, and the system was blowing east without a well-defined center, the hurricane center reported. The storm was still expected to drop between 1 and 3 inches of rain over the central Gulf Coast and Southeast through Monday, raising the possibility of localized coastal flooding, but all storm warnings were discontinued late Saturday. Karen formed on Thursday between Cuba and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula with 65-mph winds.

"New York (CNN) -- Ashley Murray never expected to follow five generations of men into the family business, selling industrial gasses and welding supplies. Then her father passed away and Murray, the youngest of his four children, stepped up. She became the first female president of Liberty Industrial Gases and Welding Supplies Inc. in Brooklyn. ""I grew up working in the business, all of my siblings did. We would file, paint cylinders and work in the store. I got involved about 10 years ago working under my father, running operations for five years when he passed away,"" recalls Murray, who still keeps her father's office much the way he left it. ""I've continued to run it, and it's done great. I've been slowly purchasing it from my mom bit by bit."" But now the family history Murray was charged with preserving is at risk of ending. Liberty is in Red Hook, Brooklyn, an industrial park along a canal that connects to New York Harbor. When the waters of Superstorm Sandy surged, they engulfed 80% of her inventory in 4 feet of water. She is still without any government help. Finding joy among the wreckage: Family photos returned post-Sandy . ""It's devastating. It's just been a devastating process,"" said Murray with tears in her eyes. ""We're just kind of this lost block at the end of Smith Street in Red Hook (Brooklyn). I know all the businesses and all of the residents have been affected, but it seems like there has to be more help."" Murray estimates the destruction will put the business $700,000 to $800,000 in debt. She says Liberty had no debt before the storm. ""In 26 years, we'd had not 1 inch of water,"" she said. ""We couldn't afford to have more than the tiny bit of flood insurance that we had, and we didn't think we needed it."" In the days after Sandy, Murray attended community meetings with other business owners hoping to find some assistance from the government or elsewhere. She also collected information from the FEMA website and elsewhere online to determine what assistance might be available for her company. She found government loans with a 6% interest rate. But her bank offered her a $1 million line of credit with a 3.2% interest rate. She opted for that. Map: See Images of destruction, recovery across the East Coast . The Federal Emergency Management Agency does not issue loans to businesses impacted by Sandy. The agency tells CNN it would only give a grant to a small business if it is located within a primary home or resident damaged by Sandy. But FEMA is a federal partner of the Small Business Administration, which tells CNN it has two loan programs for businesses impacted by Sandy. The first is a disaster loan of up to $2 million for businesses that sustained physical damage. The interest rate begins at 4% (and goes higher) for a term of up to 30 years. The SBA says only businesses with no other means of credit would qualify for the 4% interest rate. The second is an economic injury disaster loan geared toward small businesses to cover operating expenses they would have otherwise been able to cover had the disaster not occurred. That loan is also capped at $2 million and comes with 4% and higher interest rates for businesses, and a 3% interest rate for nonprofits. As of Friday, 302,412 disaster loan applications have been issued by the SBA in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut -- 62,294 of those to businesses. If Murray can't get her business back up and running at full capacity, she fears her competitors will move in. She's already seen her business slip 30%. Two days after the storm, when Murray first was able to get inside her company, she began to run it off the sidewalk with ""business operations"" run out of a tiny storage room facing the street. Her employees use cell phones, generators and work off one computer and one printer perched atop a makeshift counter. Customers are greeted by a sign that says ""Liberty is open,"" but they still peak in through the roll-up garage door and can't believe it's true. ""Sometimes they just roll up their window and yell out to see if we're really here,"" Murray said. Murray has barely been home since she reopened her business; neither have her employees who have worked around the clock and on weekends. Liberty employee Nick Gardener watched Ashley Murray grow up working alongside her father. He was hired back in 1995. ""It's my life,"" he said. If it goes under, ""I would go under, too,"" Gardener added. Employees at Liberty still have a sense of humor, despite all the difficulty. Gas prices up in Sandy-stricken areas . They've placed a stuffed lion in front of the darkened warehouse with a sign around its neck that reads: ""WE ARE AS TOUGH AS IT GETS. WE ARE STILL HERE."" But inside, the business is struggling to get off its knees. You can tell the condition of the business by the cacophony of overwhelming sounds from all the machinery trying to keep it going in the absence of electrical power. Outside, the droning noise of a massive generator competes with the roar of power tools being used by workers from Consolidated Edison, as the power company tries to repair the electrical lines. You can still see the water line just above the circuit breaker boxes. Inside, you hear a sizzle as the lights flicker on and off, the hiss of propane tanks powering heaters, the clanging of empty tanks being hauled in and out for refilling since the business lost all three of their trucks and one forklift. In another room, workers pound in new drywall and toss soggy merchandise into bags. The office phones only work when the generators are running and voicemail isn't functioning. When they turn off the generator at night, calls are transferred to cell phones. Red Hook was hit so hard by Sandy that volunteers at the business next door are using blow dryers to dry piles of invoices one by one. The job is essential because their server was destroyed in the storm. The only thing that's quiet is the nearby Gowanus Canal, where the water receded. The canal was declared a federal Superfund site, meaning its waters are considered in need of cleaning up. ""They keep telling us the toxic stuff stayed at the bottom, but we just don't know,"" said Murray. Jersey Shore community gives thanks even after Sandy .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- An additional suspect was arrested Sunday in connection with this month's terrorist attack at a mall in Kenya's capital, the country's interior minister said. The arrest brings to nine the total number of people in police custody in connection with the attack on Nairobi's Westgate Shopping Mall, Interior Minister Joseph Ole Lenku told reporters. He declined to release the identities or nationalities of the suspects allegedly involved in the September 21 terror attack, which resulted in a four-day standoff that left at least 67 people dead and parts of the shopping center destroyed. ""We believe it is premature and would jeopardize the results of the investigations if we go giving you the identities of the suspects arrested,"" Lenku said. Lenku said authorities have interviewed 156 witnesses so far and found assault weapons in a vehicle they believe was used by terrorists involved in the attack. On Friday, the Kenya Red Cross said that 59 people remained missing after the attack. And last week outside a city morgue, CNN reporters saw dozens of families who were waiting for word, unsure whether their loved ones were dead or alive. But Lenku said Kenyan authorities have received no formal reports of missing persons, and believe that there were no hostages in the mall at the time the siege ended. The interior minister asked for aid agencies to forward any information they've received to the government. ""It is the government position that there were no hostages and we managed to rescue all people from the building,"" Lenku said. Lenku called for the U.S. government to lift an advisory warning travelers about Kenya, describing the State Department advisory as ""uncalled for, unnecessary and unfriendly."" Travel advisories are counterproductive in the fight against terrorism, he said. ""We cannot and shall not allow terrorists to instill fear in our people,"" he said. The State Department warning -- first put out in July -- said Americans already there or planning to go there should ""evaluate their personal security situation."" Lenku said the list of people killed in the attack includes: . • 57 Kenyans . • 2 French nationals . • 1 Chinese . • 1 Ghanaian . • 1 Canadian . • 1 Korean . • 1 Australian . • 1 South African . • 1 Peruvian . • 1 Dutch national .

"(CNN) -- Watch Amanpour's interview with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on CNN International on Wednesday at 14:00 ET / 20:00 CET . For the first time in its 34-year history, the Islamic Republic of Iran is approaching the West with a unified voice to save its sanction-afflicted economy. President Hassan Rouhani made a series of overtures ahead of his trip to New York this week in an effort to end Iran's nuclear row with the West. Rouhani and his foreign minister, Javad Zarif, sent Rosh Hashanah greetings to Jews worldwide to take the edge off the comments made by former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who had repeatedly called the Holocaust a myth. In an interview with NBC news last week, Rouhani stressed that Iran would never ""build weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons"" and announced that he had ""complete authority"" to make a deal with the West. And finally last week, he wrote a piece in the Washington Post, calling directly for ""constructive engagement."" His conciliatory gestures are meaningful only in light of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's statement last week, declaring that it was time to end the country's diplomatic dispute. Khamenei has the final word on state matters and had blocked previous governments from engagement with the West. For over two decades, he labeled ""compromise"" as a sign of weakness. But in a clear policy shift, he backed Rouhani's efforts and called for ""heroic leniency,"" suggesting that a series of internal and external challenges have brought the change. Rouhani was elected in July on a mandate to save the country's dying economy and increase social and political liberties. The country's crude oil revenue has dropped more than 50% since 2011 under U.S.-led sanctions aimed at pressuring Iran over its controversial nuclear program. Devaluation of the Rial, Iran's currency, has quadrupled since 2009 and inflation soured this month to more than 39%, according to Iranian Central Bank. Iran has no access to its assets in foreign accounts because of the sanctions and the country's gas and oil infrastructure have suffered under the restrictions. Iranian leaders are aware that economic pressure is increasing the public anger and fear that it could lead to a repeat of the massive demonstrations of 2009, when millions of people protested what they believed was a fraudulent re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The regime used violence to crush those protests but watched warily as political upheavals unfolded in Egypt, Tunisia and Bahrain. Now Iran is losing its only political ally in the region -- President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. For years, Syria has been Iran's crucial link to Hezbollah, Iran's feared arm in the Middle East that brought significant regional power for Iran. Assad's demise, would dash Iran's hopes of becoming a major regional player. Iranians are reasonably optimistic this time that President Rouhani can ease the sanctions and lift some of political pressures at home. The Rial, the local currency, strengthened by 25% against the U.S. dollar this week, indicating high levels of hope before Rouhani's trip. The regime also released 80 activists who had been jailed since the protests in 2009. Prominent political leaders still remain behind bars, which reminded people not to have high expectations. Rouhani was elected in a semi-democratic election to restore some of the regime's lost legitimacy while posing no serious threat to Khamenei's leadership. The regime barred liberal candidates with large support base from entering the race but unlike 2009, it went ahead and counted the votes cast for Rouhani. Rouhani had sided with Khamenei during the country's first pro-democracy uprising in 1999 that led to brutal repression of the student movement. He emerged in the presidential race this year as a moderate, indicating the depth of change within the regime. Rouhani had served as Iran's first nuclear negotiator and in 2003 signed the Additional Protocol that allowed the United Nations' nuclear inspectors visit Iran's nuclear sites. As Iranian analyst Nasser Hadian argued this month, Rouhani ""knows how to navigate the corridors of power in Iran"" and formulate a strategy out of the current diplomatic impasse. He is a trusted politician who has known Khamenei for 40 years and served as his representative on the Supreme National Security Council for 25 years. ""His insider status is an asset rather than a liability,"" Hadian wrote. Khamenei backed Rouhani's diplomatic efforts this month during a meeting with members of the Revolutionary Guards Corps -- a hard-line military force that has historically opposed engagement with the West . Khamenei also urged the force not to interfere in politics, a shift from previous years that would be crucial to avoid derailing Rouhani's efforts.","Rouhani was elected on a mandate to save Iran's dying economy and increase political liberties, writes Fathi .
Iranian leaders are aware that economic pressure is increasing the public anger, she says .
Rouhani served as Iran's first nuclear negotiator... allowing U.N. inspectors to visit Iran's nuclear sites .

"Athens (CNN) -- A Jewish group in Greece has condemned the leader of the extreme-right Golden Dawn party over comments he made about the Holocaust in a TV interview. Nikos Michaloliakos told Greece's Mega TV channel in an interview shown Sunday that ""there were no gas chambers and ovens [crematoria] in Auschwitz,"" said the Central Board of Jewish Communities in Greece, or KIS. The politician's remarks come amid growing concern about the apparent rise of the far right in Greece. Golden Dawn won 21 seats in the country's May 6 parliamentary elections, after winning almost 7% of the vote. Two years ago, it commanded only 0.28% support. Some members of the ultranationalist party, which proposes harsh measures to combat illegal immigration, have been linked with street violence and neo-Nazism. In a statement, KIS urged the Greek government to ""condemn and isolate the forces seeking the revival of the darkest ideology of the European history,"" saying Michaloliakos' position was an affront to the Greek people. ""It is an insult to the historical memory, the memory of the 6 million Jews, our brethren, amongst whom there where 70,000 Greek Jews, who perished in the death camps of Auschwitz, Dachau, Treblinka and the other sites of the extermination factory founded by Adolf Hitler,"" KIS said in a statement. ""It is an insult toward the survivors, who are still alive to bear witness of this atrocity. It is an insult toward all those who fought against the Nazis. It is an insult to the history of Greece, the sacrifices of the Greek people and the struggle to defend the principles of freedom, democracy and humanism."" Greek government spokesman Pantelis Kapsis condemned Michaloliakos' remarks in a statement Monday as ""a distortion of history and a fierce insult to the memory of the millions of Holocaust victims."" Greece has been in a state of political turmoil since the elections, which saw voters fleeing the moderate parties blamed for backing harsh austerity measures for parties to the far left and far right of the political spectrum. The country faces fresh elections after repeated attempts to form a coalition government ended in failure Tuesday. The political instability has raised the possibility that Greece will fail to make debt payments as early as next month, potentially forcing the country out of the euro, the currency used by 17 European Union countries. Matthew Feldman, director of the Radicalism and New Media Research Group at the University of Northampton, in Britain, says far-right groups are seeing a resurgence in parts of Europe. Instead of open racial attacks, they play up a threat to national identity and criticize multiculturalism, particularly as it relates to Islam, he said. However, while Golden Dawn gained strength in the May 6 election, another far-right party, LAOS, lost its small presence in Greece's 300-seat parliament as voters punished it for its support of Greece's austerity program.","Nikos Michaloliakos said on a Greek TV channel: ""There were no gas chambers"" in Auschwitz .

"Washington (CNN) -- When it comes to 2016, Hillary Clinton is in no rush to decide about another run for the White House. This amid mounting speculation that Clinton will launch another bid, and with everything she says, and every move she makes, scrutinized for signals of where she stands when it comes to her political future. ""I'm not in any hurry. I think it's a serious decision, not to be made lightly, but it's also not one that has to be made soon,"" Clinton told New York Magazine in her first interview since retiring as secretary of state at the beginning of this year. Far from her denials in interviews at the beginning of the year, when she told CNN that she had ""absolutely no plans to run,"" Clinton now appears to be wrestling with a decision, saying in the New York Magazine interview that ""I will just continue to weigh what the factors are that would influence me making a decision."" Hillary Clinton on 2016 run: 'I'm realistic' Even as Clinton 2016 story count keeps rising many Democrats both inside and outside Clinton World agree that, because of who she is, she doesn't need to be the first one out of the gate to announce her 2016 intentions. ""There is definitely no rush for Hillary to decide about 2016,"" said Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Paul Begala. ""As someone who wants her to run, I still understand that she has lots of time. No one should try to rush Hillary on this. She has earned the right to advance her mission in the foundation. Hillary has earned the unique status she has today, and there is no need for her to be pressured into diving back into the political swamp."" Thanks to her name recognition, the former first lady, senator from New York and secretary of state is the overwhelming frontrunner in early 2016 surveys. In the most recent survey, conducted earlier this month by CNN/ORC International, nearly two-thirds of Democrats and independents who lean toward that party said they were likely to back Clinton as their presidential nominee. Vice President Joe Biden came in a distant second, at 10%, with freshman Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 7%, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo at 6%, and Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley at 2%. The CNN survey was in line with previous polls from other organizations conducted earlier this year that indicated Clinton was far ahead of all the other possible Democratic contenders. Begala, who was a senior political adviser to President Bill Clinton, said Hillary Clinton's ""time horizon and the whole rest of the party's time horizon are very, very different,"" adding that ""anybody else has got to start to lay the groundwork"" much earlier than Clinton."" ""Hillary has more time than anyone else. And that's why her friends, and I'm one of them, are saying she can take her time. She doesn't need to build name identification. She doesn't even need to build a roster of donors."" Translation: Don't expect to see Clinton make a stop in Iowa, New Hampshire, or South Carolina anytime soon, as some of the other potential 2016ers, such as O'Malley and even Biden, have already made. Clinton already has a superPAC named ""Ready for Hillary"" actively raising money in support of a possible 2016 bid. And the political action committee that Begala advises, ""Priorities USA,"" which was formed in 2011 to back President Barack Obama's 2012 re-election campaign and spent millions on TV ads critical of Mitt Romney, could play a similar role for Clinton should she run again. Asked if there is a concern that if Clinton waits too long, some big name donors and influential Democratic politicians could stray to other 2016 candidates, Begala said such a scenario is ""not a concern at all."" Not all Democrats agree. ""She is the prohibitive favorite, but the dynamics of the race change the longer someone waits. So the question is how long can she wait,"" said Chris Kofinis, a Democratic strategist and a veteran of the Wesley Clark 2004 and John Edwards 2008 presidential campaigns. ""If she gets in early, she sucks up the oxygen, the money, and the grassroots. She could basically kill the field."" Palin: Hillary Clinton ill-suited to be president . When it comes to polling, Clinton's standing now compares to her situation the first time she ran for president, when she was the Democratic favorite in the early years of the 2008 presidential cycle. She was the front-runner in CNN polling from mid-2005 through 2006, prior to her January 2007 announcement that she was forming an exploratory committee, which formally kicked off her presidential fundraising and campaigning. By then, Sens. Barack Obama of Illinois and Chris Dodd of Connecticut, Biden, former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico had all jumped in. Pelosi: Hillary Clinton more ready for White House than husband, Obama were . Clinton and Obama eventually went on to battle each other in a historic primary season, which ended with Clinton ending her bid for the nomination in June 2008, at the conclusion of the primary calendar. Ben LaBolt, a veteran of three presidential campaigns, suggests there may be a middle ground for Clinton. ""Secretary Clinton faces a paradoxical choice: If she announces that she's re-entering the political fray, scrutiny on her would be heightened exponentially. Yet even without an announcement, the press and her potential opponents are already treating her like she is running,"" said LaBolt, who served as a deputy press secretary for Obama's 2008 campaign and national press secretary for the 2012 re-election campaign. ""The solution might be to ensure trusted advisers are working from the outside to manage rapid response, cultivate donors and study her prospective competitors' records to lay the groundwork for a run for as long as possible without jumping two feet in."" Clinton herself downplays any imminent announcement, saying such speculation isn't good for the country. ""It's like when you meet somebody at a party and they look over your shoulder to see who else is there,"" Clinton said. ""And you want to talk to them about something that's really important; in fact, maybe you came to the party to talk to that particular person, and they just want to know what's next. I feel like that's our political process right now. I just don't think it is good.""","Hillary Clinton tells an interviewer that she's wrestling with a 2016 decision .

Union Beach is a small seaside community with fewer than 6,500 residents, and Sandy hit it hard, destroying nearly 200 homes and decimating the coastline. ""It was kind of like 'The Wizard of Oz,'"" said resident Pamela Vasquez. A hot tub was found a block and a half away from where it once sat. Remnants of wooden decks floated in the tide. Family photo albums were buried under piles where multistory houses once stood. Powerless in New Jersey post-Sandy . Jeannette Van Houten also lost her Union Beach home in Sandy, but buried among the devastation she found a calling -- to return memories of happier times to the 1.8-square-mile township by reuniting residents with the family photographs that Sandy scattered to the winds. The day after the storm, Van Houten went for a walk along the shoreline to assess the damage and she stumbled upon a photograph of a couple attending a wedding. She leaned down, picked it up and, suddenly, her mission became clear. ""Photos are the only things that hold us to the past. My niece was murdered in 2008 and the only thing we have left of her is our photos,"" said Van Houten. She soon started a Facebook page where she uploaded the pictures she found, hopeful that through the power of social media, residents of the small community would see them and be able to identify the faces and families in the photographs. Since she started, Van Houten has uploaded more than 2,000 photos to the Facebook page -- and she's still looking each day for more lost memories among the debris. About 60 families have reclaimed photos so far, she said. And some people, like Lewandowski and her daughters, have since joined the effort. Read more: Remembering the victims . After all, Van Houten is the reason Lewandowski saw her late mother on Facebook and broke down that day; Van Houten is the reason she got a rare memento of her mother back. ""My mother, very much like myself, hated having her picture taken. That day, I didn't see anything but a picture of my mother holding my baby. I even posted 'Today is going to be a good day.' It's such a gift,"" said Lewandowski. Vasquez, who also lost her home, found baby photos of her now grown children on Van Houten's Facebook page. ""You hold your memories in your heart, but yet to be able to look back, it's amazing,"" she said. ""My husband's parents are both gone and we had a picture of both of them in our living room. We don't have them anymore. It's nice that somebody's out there trying to find your memories and give them back to you."" Paying it forward, Vasquez has also begun to take photos she finds to the police station to be uploaded to the online forum. Read more: Salvaging smeared memories in Sandy's wake . ""You can lose your home, you can lose your possessions. Volunteers can help you get food, get shelter, get clothing, but in the end, if no one thinks of picking up the photos or the objects that were miles from where they were supposed to be, people don't feel whole,"" said Van Houten. As more communities that were ordered to evacuate are allowed to re-enter their neighborhoods, similar initiatives have begun to pop up along the badly beaten Jersey Shore. Map: See images of destruction, recovery across the East Coast . Jeannie Esti recently started the For Shore Photos Project, which asks residents and cleanup volunteers to collect photographs that were strewn about in the storm surge. Esti lives in Rhode Island now, but she grew up in Mantoloking, New Jersey, where her parents still live. Her childhood home was luckily left unscathed, but in the backyard, she found kitchen cabinets, books, even a little boy's football helmet signed by the actor and former football player John Amos. And, of course, photographs. ""I grew up with sand in my pants in my whole life,"" she said. ""It's that moment where you sit back and think these could be my pictures."" For those without photo scanners, Esti has teamed up with local New Jersey businesses like Joe Leone's specialty food stores in Sea Girt and Point Pleasant as drop-off locations for lost-and-found photos that are then collected and uploaded to the For Shore Photos Facebook page. ""Photography is so common and ubiquitous that we take it for granted, and we don't realize how important it is to us,"" said Marina Berio, who heads the general studies program at the International Center of Photography. ""It's the despair of losing part of yourself. Your very memories are being taken away from you."" Jenika McDavitt, a photographer who studied psychology at Yale and runs the blog ""Psychology for Photographers,"" agrees. ""We as humans become habituated to our environment. We forget the way that grandma's house looked. When you find a photo that shows those things that you are habituated to and you forgot, it brings back all those memories that you forgot to stop and remember,"" she said. When Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast in 2005, Sue Weber of Erie, Pennsylvania, also recognized the power of photography and started The Picture Project. After seeing a reporter on television hold up a picture that was found in the middle of the street of a child in a dance costume, Weber had a revelation similar to Van Houten's. ""Then it hit me -- many families on the Gulf Coast had lost their entire history in family photos due to Katrina and I should do something about it,"" she said. Partnering with Kodak, the Biloxi Sun Herald and United Van lines, among others, The Picture Project was able to return thousands of photos to their rightful owners. Weber's revelation also came about because of the coffee table book ""The Last Album: Eyes from the Ashes of Auschwitz-Birkenau,"" which sat in front of her during the news report. Weber had attended a presentation at the Erie Museum by the book's author, Ann Weiss, several years prior. During a tour of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in 1986, Weiss discovered an archive of more than 2,000 photographs confiscated from Jewish families at the death camp. Trying to keep the family business afloat after Sandy . ""They wanted to bring their emblem of who they were, and they wanted to remember the lives that they lived and the people that they loved. Or even, just remember the people they themselves once were,"" said Weiss. Weiss fought red tape to obtain the pictures and after doing so, traveled around the world tracking down any survivors, family members and friends that they might belong to. Being stripped of family memories in the Holocaust is very different from losing belongings in a natural disaster, Weiss pointed out, but the end result of both is profound loss. ""I think all photos are incredibly important because photos are the emblem of our lives. They're tangible proof that we lived, that we're here and when there's a natural disaster -- after the people and after the pets -- what's the first thing we want to save? It's always the pictures,"" she said. ""Pictures encapsulate our lives, our dreams, our essence of who we are.""

"(CNN) -- Major League Baseball on Monday suspended 13 players, including New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez, after an investigation into the use of performance-enhancing drugs. The league suspended Rodriguez for 211 regular-season games through the 2014 season, but the 38-year-old slugger said he planned to appeal. Twelve other players have accepted 50-game suspensions without pay. A-Rod and the other players are accused of having ties to the now-shuttered Biogenesis anti-aging clinic in south Florida and taking performance-enhancing drugs. Rodriguez has denied the accusation. ""I'm fighting for my life. I have to defend myself. If I don't defend myself, no one else will,"" he told reporters after the league announced its decision. Twitter reaction to A-Rod ban . The last seven months have been a ""nightmare,"" he said. It ""has been probably the worst time of my life for sure,"" said Rodriguez, ""obviously for the circumstances that are at hand and also dealing with a very tough surgery and a rehab program, and being 38."" Asked directly whether he had used performance-enhancing drugs, he declined -- repeatedly -- to comment. ""I think we'll have a forum to discuss all of that, and we'll talk about it then,"" Rodriguez said. Earlier in a written statement, he said that he was disappointed with the penalty and intends to appeal. He thanked family, friends and fans for their support and stressed that he was eager to get back on the field with his teammates. Timeline of Alex Rodriguez's rise and fall . His suspension is set to go into effect on Thursday, the league said. But officials also said that Rodriguez could keep playing if he appeals. He arrived Monday in Chicago, where he played in a night game against the White Sox. The Yankees' roster listed him in the starting lineup, batting fourth and playing third base. At his first at-bat, Rodriguez was met with boos and some cheers from the crowd. He hit a single to left field. Before the game started, Yankees manager Joe Girardi said Rodriguez's suspension wouldn't affect the team. ""He's here. He's going to play,"" Girardi told reporters. ""It really doesn't change anything for us."" What's next for A-Rod? Major League Baseball's sweeping investigation shows a change in how officials handle performance-enhancing drugs, CNN sports reporter Rachel Nichols said. ""It used to be that baseball protected its own,"" she said. ""And now we're seeing other people in the clubhouse, from managers to the players, saying, 'You know what? Go after these guys. We don't want them in the game.'"" On Monday, Commissioner Bud Selig said the league had no choice but to investigate the allegations in order to ""maintain integrity, fairness and a level playing field."" ""Despite the challenges this situation has created during a great season on the field,"" he said, ""we pursued this matter because it was not only the right thing to do, but the only thing to do."" Sports Illustrated writer Ben Reiter described the suspension of Rodriguez as ""unprecedented."" ""The sheer magnitude of the suspension is just one we've never seen before,"" he said. Union: 'We agree with his decision to fight his suspension' The league said Rodriguez's punishment is based on his alleged use and possession of banned performance-enhancing substances, including testosterone and human growth hormone, for multiple years. Officials also accuse him of ""engaging in a course of conduct intended to obstruct or frustrate"" their investigation into the matter. The Major League Baseball Players Association said Monday that it's standing behind Rodriguez. ""We agree with his decision to fight his suspension,"" the union said in a written statement, adding that it believed the league's commissioner ""has not acted appropriately."" Rodriguez's lawyer, David Cornwell, criticized the league. ""Major League Baseball has gone well beyond the authority granted it in its Joint Drug Agreement and the Basic Agreement,"" he said. ""Consequently, we will appeal the discipline and pursue all legal remedies available to Alex."" Opinion: A-Rod got off light . Before Monday's announcement, the Biogenesis scandal had already ensnared one star: 2011 National League MVP and Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun. Last month, Braun was suspended without pay for the rest of this season for violating the league's drug policy. Yankees: We're ""focused on playing baseball"" The New York Yankees declined to comment on Rodriguez's suspension until the completion of the appeal process. ""In the meantime,"" the team said in a written statement, ""the Yankees remain focused on playing baseball."" The team did say it was disappointed by the suspension of Yankees catcher Francisco Cervelli, who was one of the 12 players who agreed to the 50-game suspension. ""It's clear that he used bad judgment,"" the Yankees said. Major League Baseball issued a statement saying that Rodriguez was being disciplined under both baseball's Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program and the players' collective bargaining agreement. Under the drug program, ""Rodriguez's suspension will be stayed until the completion of his appeal if Rodriguez files a grievance challenging his discipline,"" the MLB statement said. That is also the usual case for suspensions related to drug offenses under the collective bargaining agreement, but the statement did not specifically address that aspect. Rich contract may be adding on to A-Rod's woes . Impressive record . Rodriguez is considered one of the game's greatest sluggers. He has 647 home runs -- the fifth most ever -- in 19 seasons. In 2009, he had an outstanding postseason as he helped the Yankees win their most recent World Series title. He holds the largest contract ever in American sports, signing with the Yankees in 2007 for $275 million over 10 years. Rodriguez said Friday he believes his contract makes him an attractive target for a baseball ban or suspension. ""There's more than one party that benefits from me not ever stepping back on the field -- and that's not my teammates and it's not the Yankees fans,"" he said. Rodriguez has missed the entire 2013 season so far after undergoing hip surgery. Other players suspended . The other players suspended by Major League Baseball Monday are: . Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Antonio Bastardo . San Diego Padres shortstop Everth Cabrera . New York Yankees catcher Francisco Cervelli . Texas Rangers outfielder Nelson Cruz . Padres pitcher Fautino De Los Santos . Houston Astros pitcher Sergio Escalona . Yankees outfielder Fernando Martinez . Seattle Mariners catcher Jesus Montero . Free agent pitcher Jordan Norberto . Detroit Tigers shortstop Jhonny Peralta . New York Mets outfielder Cesar Puello . Mets infielder/outfielder Jordany Valdespin . De Los Santos, Escalona, Martinez, Montero, Puello and Valdespin are currently on minor league rosters. In written statements, several teams said they backed the league's decision. Cruz said he had made an ""error in judgment"" after an infection left him concerned about whether he would be physically able to play. ""Faced with this situation, I made an error in judgment that I deeply regret, and I accept full responsibility for that error. I should have handled the situation differently, and my illness was no excuse,"" he said. ""I look forward to regaining the trust and respect of the Rangers organization, my teammates, and the great Rangers' fans, and I am grateful for the opportunity to rejoin the team for the playoffs.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Briefly back in Congress doing his day job, Ron Paul met with high school students outside his office. True to form, he signed copies of the Constitution and wryly told them with a chuckle, ""No one around here reads it very much. I'd like to get everybody to read it."" Paul made a detour from the presidential campaign trail to Capitol Hill on Wednesday in order to cast a vote to protest raising the debt limit. ""We are in denial here in Congress,"" Paul said on the House floor. ""If we had the vaguest idea of how serious this crisis is financially, not only for us but for the world, we would cut spending."" The busy Texas Republican lawmaker seemed to cram in as much as he could to push his libertarian agenda -- even introducing legislation to repeal indefinite detention of terror suspects he calls unconstitutional. Paul running fourth in latest South Carolina poll . What Paul did not do was attend a closed-door gathering of House Republicans. In fact, the GOP presidential contender is known to never attend these meetings. But Paul's Republican colleagues who did go had no shortage of opinions about his strong showing in the presidential race so far. Many were good. ""You've got to admire an individual who, despite the currents of the time -- polling data -- says what he believes in and sticks to it. Ron Paul does that,"" said Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Alabama, who has served with Paul for years. ""The public understands we have too many Monty Halls and Bob Barkers wanting to make a deal or 'the price is right' in Washington, D.C., and they're yearning for leadership -- people who take a position and stick to it,"" Brooks said. Rep. Kevin Brady, Paul's fellow Texan, said he disagrees with Paul on many issues but isn't surprised about his success in these tough economic times. ""He's been so consistent over the years. He feels very strongly about limited government, about personal responsibility and individual freedoms, and staying consistent has drawn a good, solid base for him in this presidential campaign,"" Brady said. Other House Republicans were less positive about Paul's ascent. ""I don't have any personal dislike for the man, but I will say to you that he has really been essentially totally ineffective in Congress,"" said Rep. Trent Franks, R-Arizona. Franks, who has endorsed Newt Gingrich, called Paul a ""nonplayer"" on Capitol Hill. ""That's why most of his supporters support him, but what they don't realize is that most of the things he puts forward are only for the consumption of the public,"" Franks said. From government spending to military action abroad, Paul has spent decades building a reputation that earned him a nickname inside the GOP leadership: Doctor No. ""He voted no on absolutely everything,"" said John Feehery, a veteran House Republican leadership aide who worked for former House Speaker Dennis Hastert and House Majority Leader Tom DeLay. ""We didn't count on him for anything. In many ways, he was an ideological warrior,"" Feehery said. ""Many times, the vote would be 434-1 -- he'd be the one, but he was the one who kind of put up the ideological goal posts -- this is where you should be if you're pure, and what we found is no one is really pure except Ron Paul,"" he said. Several House Republicans told CNN they admire his purism. ""Dr. No puts up his vote, and if you want to know why, he tells you why. And if you want to vote with him, great, and there's been a lot to be said for it,"" said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, who says he personally likes Paul very much. But Issa is one of several Paul legislative colleagues who say that his refusal to compromise often goes too far. ""Ron Paul is less like a Ronald Reagan and more like somebody who is a great professor but you wouldn't want to have him run your company,"" Issa said. So far, 64 members of Congress have endorsed Mitt Romney. Just three have endorsed Paul, the only sitting lawmaker in the race. One is Paul's son Rand, a senator from Kentucky. Another is Paul's good friend Walter Jones, a fellow anti-war Republican. ""I like Ron Paul's independence,"" Jones told CNN in his office. ""He knows we've got to fix the problems of the American people. We've got to fix the job situation. We've got to bring this debt down, and I think he is exactly what America needs right now."" Paul campaign rakes in $1.3 million in two days . Jones has supported Paul for years and watched him extolling the importance of less involvement abroad, smaller government and greater personal liberties without finding mass appeal. Jones thinks Paul has caught fire now because he has been so consistent. ""They trust him,"" Jones said. Paul has a reputation in Congress as a loner. But Jones dismisses that by revealing a mock picture he displays in his office of Paul with congressional friends, dressed as the singing group The Four Tops. ""It's a great picture of him,"" jokes Jones. ""He's got the look of a president."" But Paul's good friend from North Carolina does concede that ""he's just not a socialite."" ""He's a workhorse, and that's what Washington needs right now is a workhorse, not a show horse,"" Jones said. He also warned that even if Paul isn't the nominee, the Republican Party needs to listen to him and show respect or risk losing the opportunity to capture some of Paul's supporters who are young and independent. ""He brings a support base that is so truly committed to his points of views and his issues that if the party doesn't find a way to bring Ron Paul in, I don't think he's going to do anything outside of it, but he won't be very helpful.""","Republican presidential candidate consistently goes his own way .

"(CNN) -- After weeks of relative calm, clashes erupted between supporters of ousted President Mohamed Morsy and Egyptian security forces and local residents in several areas in Cairo, state media outlets reported. Additonally, pro-Morsy and anti-Morsy protesters clashed in other Egyptian cities. Three people died and 23 were hurt in Zeitoun, in western Cairo, and one person was killed and 17 injured in Manial in central Cairo, according to state media. The violence came during a pro-Morsy march in Cairo. Since Morsy's ouster and detention in July, his supporters have taken to the streets most Fridays. His supporters were unable to reach Tahrir Square and the presidential palace, according to state-run Al-Ahram. Morsy's son: 'Dad, you are the legitimate leader' Compared with violence in August that claimed hundreds of lives, the latest clashes appeared almost minor. On Friday, an anti-Morsy politician was stabbed in Cairo. It wasn't clear whether the attack was tied to the protests. State media reported that Khaled Dawoud sustained stab wounds to his chest and hand. Dawoud resigned from the government in August in protest of the bloody crackdown on Muslim Brotherhood supporters. The unrest came amid reports on state media concerning the fate of 170 imprisoned members of the Muslim Brotherhood. Nile TV reported that this group, including a former governor, will be held for 15 more days for further investigation. It was not clear how long this group had been held or on what charges. Since July, arrests and violence have been commonplace. In September, an Egyptian court banned all activities of the Muslim Brotherhood and froze its finances, drawing complaints from the international community. At the United Nations last week, Egypt's interim foreign minister sought to quell these concerns. Nabil Fahmy said Egypt will hold elections in the spring. He also argued that the political process is open to all ""as long as they are committed to the renunciation of violence and terrorism and acts of incitement to them.""

"(CNN) -- Dutch airline Transavia said it has launched an investigation after a Boeing 737 pilot was locked out of the cockpit and his first officer was later found asleep at the controls. The incident took place in September, when the airliner was en route from Greece to the Netherlands, a top Dutch safety investigation agency said. The 737 landed safely in Amsterdam as scheduled, the airline said Wednesday. According to a Dutch Safety Board report released Wednesday, the pilot stepped out of the cockpit to take a bathroom break about 2Â½ hours into the flight. When he returned a short time later, the pilot used an intercom to ask his first officer to open the door. There was no answer, the report said. Eventually, the pilot alerted the crew and was able to open the door himself. That's when he found the first officer asleep, according to the report. ""It's a serious incident,"" said Wim van der Weegen of the Dutch Safety Board, ""What makes it serious is the combination of the pilot being unable to access the cockpit and the first officer being asleep. ""By 'serious incident,' I mean the flight was in danger,"" he said. The Dutch Safety Board will decide whether to open its own inquiry when the airline's investigation is finished, van der Weegen said. Laws regarding pilot breaks during flights vary from country to country. For U.S. carriers, sleeping while at the controls is a violation of FAA regulations. Flights longer than eight hours require a relief pilot on board to take over when pilots sleep. U.S. airlines also require a flight attendant to be in the cockpit when the pilot or first officer take bathroom breaks, in case the person flying the aircraft becomes incapacitated.

"(CNN) -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the United States is ""lacking of initiative"" on Syria and suggested that could be because of the upcoming U.S. election. During a wide-ranging interview in Istanbul with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Erdogan discussed the 18-month crisis in Syria and touched on a number of other topics, including Iran's suspected nuclear program. ""Right now, there are certain things being expected from the United States. The United States had not yet catered to those expectations,"" the prime minister said when asked whether he was surprised the United States is not offering anything but ""nonlethal support"" to the Syrian opposition. ""Maybe it's because of the elections -- maybe it's because of the pre-election situation in the States. Might be the root cause of the lacking of initiative. Nobody has spoken to us about their reasons, and they are not obliged to state anything. We are very thankful and pleased they have stated that they're against this regime,"" he said through a translator. Erdogan has been prime minister since 2003. The leader of a political movement with Islamist roots, he established himself as an influential voice and a power broker across the region. He has gained popularity in the Arab world, as well as in Turkey, for his criticism of Israel's actions in the Palestinian territory of Gaza. He has taken a strong stand against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime, hosting opposition leaders and refugees from Syria. Erdogan has called on the U.N. Security Council to declare a no-fly zone along the Turkey-Syria border. Turkey hardens military position after Syria downs jet . So far, about 80,000 Syrian refugees have sought sanctuary in Turkey. Ankara has also hosted groups opposed to al-Assad, and is a vital transport route for opposition fighters and weapons into Syria. When asked what he thought the biggest danger to Turkey was, Erdogan reinforced what Western nations have been saying about weapons of mass destruction. ""Well, the biggest danger, not only for Turkey but for the entire region and the world is ... the employment of weapons of mass destruction and chemical ones, of course. If a slightest suggestion of such an attempt should emerge, not only in Turkey, but the attitude of the entire globe is going to change forever,"" he said. Syria's foreign ministry has said the country has chemical or biological weapons, but would never use them against its citizens -- only against foreign attackers. The statement drew harsh condemnation from world leaders, including U.S. President Barack Obama, who said the Syrian government would risk crossing a ""red line"" and invite U.S. military intervention if it uses chemical weapons. Obama is running for re-election in November. Switching gears to talk about Iran's suspected nuclear program, Erdogan said he does not believe Israel will launch a full-scale attack against Tehran. The United States and other Western powers suspect Iran's announced development of nuclear fuel masks efforts to build a nuclear bomb. Iran insists it is producing enriched uranium only for peaceful purposes, to fuel civilian power plants and medical reactors, and it has refused U.N. Security Council demands to halt that work. ""I do not believe Israel will attack Iran in the fashion that you described in your question. It's a very null probability. Otherwise (that) would have caused an apocalypse in the entire region,"" Erdogan said. ""But I'm sure that I don't want to see anything like that happening in the region because in this day and age, that region needs peace and prosperity and stability.""

"Paris (CNN) -- The Old Mostar Bridge, the giant Buddhas of Bamiyan, and now the Mausoleums of Timbuktu. Once again, culture is under attack. Militants from the Ansar Dine group, which controls much of northern Mali, have started to destroy Timbuktu's ancient tombs. In three days, half of the town's shrines have been destroyed in a display of fanaticism. In rebel hands since January, Timbuktu has been taken beyond the pale. Mali has gone from one of West Africa's most stable democracies to a country gripped by chaos, where over 300,000 people have been uprooted. The destruction of Timbuktu's shrines adds a moral and cultural crisis to a desperate humanitarian situation. These are not accidents, nor the unfortunate side effects of conflict. This destruction is deliberate, undertaken in cold blood to catch the world's attention and destroy the last defenses of Malian identity and strength. This attack is led by a tiny armed minority, who violently imposes its interpretation of a faith on a distraught local community, spoiling centuries of tolerance and exchange. We must realize what is really going on. There is much more at stake than a handful of structures made of mud and wood -- as valuable as they are. Timbuktu is no ordinary town. The fabled ""City of 333 Saints,"" is an ancient desert crossroads and a historic seat of Islamic learning and faith. The attack on Timbuktu's cultural heritage is an attack against this history and the values it carries -- values of tolerance, exchange and living together, which lie at the heart of Islam. It is an attack against the physical evidence that peace and dialogue is possible. This is condemned uniformly by religious leaders across the world. The International Criminal Court calls this a war crime. We call it an attack against humanity. This is an attempt to isolate and exclude, to sever the ties that bind peoples together. There is no justification for such a wanton destruction. Beyond universal condemnation, we must act to protect our common heritage as one of our most precious assets to build peace and foster mutual understanding in a globalized world. Islamist militants taking advantage of chaos in Mali . Protecting culture is not a luxury -- it is a security issue. Attacks against cultural heritage are attacks against the very identity of communities. They lead to devastation that can be irreparable, with an impact that lasts long after the dust has settled. Attacks on the past make reconciliation much harder in the future. We know also the power of World Heritage to bring together divided communities and promote international cooperation in difficult contexts. I saw this personally in south-east Europe, for instance, when UNESCO helped rebuild the Old Mostar Bridge in Bosnia Herzegovina, destroyed during the war in the 1990s. UNESCO is also engaged today in restoration work in the Bamiyan Valley of Afghanistan. As globalization accelerates, people feel ever more the need to protect their identities and sense of belonging. Culture has today a central role in peace building and conflict prevention. This is why it is such an easy target for fanatics. Forty years ago, the world's nations came together behind the World Heritage Convention, inspired by the idea that we share a heritage that is universal and that draws all cultures together. Fanatics across the planet will always try to counter this idea. These attacks call on us to renew our commitment to protect culture. Just as 40 years ago, we need a new leap of global solidarity today, starting in Timbuktu. I call on all parties to stop these tragic and irreversible acts. I am mobilizing UNESCO fully to provide support to the government and people of Mali. I have spoken to the leaders of the country and across the region and called on them to bring all the influence they have to help the people of Mali resolve the current crisis through dialogue.","Irina Bokova: The destruction of Timbuktu's shrines adds a moral and cultural crisis to a desperate humanitarian situation .
