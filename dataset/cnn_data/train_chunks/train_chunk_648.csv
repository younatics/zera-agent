A Northern California wildfire raging out of control on Friday has grown to more than three-times the size of the city of San Francisco and has spread inside the border of Yosemite National Park. Authorities have urged more evacuations in nearby communities where thousands have fled during the week as flames marched through the timbered slopes of the western Sierra Nevada. The fire closed backcountry hiking in the park, but was so far not threatening the popular Yosemite Valley region. A sign on the edge of Yosemite National Park is surrounded by a burn from the Rim Fire on Friday . During Thursday night the blaze grew from 99 square miles to more than 165 square miles . The fire has grown from 99 square miles to more than 165 square miles overnight and is only two percent contained. Smoke blowing across the Sierra into Nevada forced officials in several counties to cancel outdoor school activities and issue health advisories, especially for people with respiratory problems. ‘Most of the fire activity is pushing to the east right into Yosemite,’ said Daniel Berlant, spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The fire is threatening about 4,500 residences, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Officials issued voluntary evacuation advisories for two new towns on Friday - Tuolumne City, population 1,800, and Ponderosa Hills, a community of several hundred - which are about five miles from the fire, spokesman Jerry Snyder said. A mandatory evacuation order remained in effect for part of Pine Mountain Lake, a summer gated community that's a few miles from the fire line. Sonora Fire Department firefighters in Yosemite National Park, California, the Rim Fire continues to burn out of control and threatens 4,500 homes nearby . Already, the blaze has destroyed four homes and 12 outbuildings in several different areas, Snyder said. One firefighter also sustained a heat-related injury. While the park remained open, the blaze closed a 4-mile stretch of State Route 120, one of three entrances into Yosemite on the west side. The other western routes and an eastern route were open. Within the park, the blaze was burning on about 17 square miles in a remote area around Lake Eleanor, about four miles northwest of Hetch Hetchy reservoir, Yosemite spokeswoman Kari Cobb said. Backcountry permits are required to hike in that area, Cobb said, and the park was no longer issuing those and had contacted every person who had received a permit to go there. Two roads into that area were closed and occupants of a campground near the Route 120 west entrance were relocated. ‘We don't have anybody we know of in that area based on the permits we have out now,’ she said. Yosemite National Park is now threatened by the Rim Fire and Calif. Gov. Jerry Brown has issued a state of emergency as the size of the fire has tripled . So far the wildfire has not threatened the popular Yosemite Valley region . The fire was more than 20 miles from Yosemite Valley and skies there were ‘crystal clear,’ Cobb said. The spectacular valley carved by glaciers offers visitors such iconic sights as the Half Dome and El Capitan rock formations and Bridalveil and Yosemite falls. ‘Right now there are no closures and no visitor services are being affected in the park,’ Cobb said. ‘We just have to take one day at a time depending on fire activity.’ Officials also have advised voluntary evacuations of more than a thousand other homes, several organized camps and at least two campgrounds in the area outside the park's boundary. More homes, businesses and hotels are threatened in nearby Groveland, a community of 600 about five miles from the fire and 25 miles from the entrance of Yosemite. ‘Usually during summer, it's swamped with tourists, you can't find parking downtown,’ said Christina Wilkinson, who runs Groveland's social media page and lives in Pine Mountain Lake. ‘Now, the streets are empty. All we see is firefighters, emergency personnel and fire trucks.’ The wildfire has closed backcountry hiking in Yosemite National Park . One of three entrances into Yosemite on the west side was closed on Friday . Many area businesses have closed and people who had vacation rental homes have cancelled plans, local business owners said. ‘This fire, it's killing our financial picture,’ said Corinna Loh, whose family owns the still-open historic Iron Door Saloon and Grill in Groveland. ‘This is our high season and it has gone to nothing, we're really hurting.’ Loh said most of her employees have left town. And the family's Spinning Wheel Ranch, where they rent cabins to tourists, has also been evacuated because it's directly in the line of fire. Two outbuildings have burned at the ranch, Loh said, and she still has no word whether the house and cabins survived. ‘We're all just standing on eggshells, waiting,’ Loh said. The governor's emergency declaration finding ‘conditions of extreme peril to the safety of persons and property’ frees up funds and firefighting resources and helps Tuolumne County in seeking federal disaster relief. More than 2,000 firefighters are already battling the blaze. The Yosemite County Tourism Bureau based in Mariposa has been helping tourists displaced by the fire to find new accommodations in other park-area towns, said director Terry Selk. Destruction: Trees in Buck Meadows are lined with glowing embers as the fire sweeps through . Front line: A fire truck travels down a Groveland road next to a wall of flames . The . Rim Fire is the fourth-largest and fastest growing wildfire in the . nation, National Interagency Fire Center spokesman Robyn Broyles said on Thursday. The . fire is among the top firefighting priorities in the U.S, according to . the National Interagency Fire Center. Currently there are 50 large . wildfires in the West. On . Wednesday, the fire had been 5 per cent contained and ranged across . 16,000 acres, but it grew dramatically overnight and the containment . level fell. Despite using . aircraft to try to contain the fire for five days, it was still raging . out of control with 100ft flames, according to CBS Sacramento. Two . evacuation centers have been set up for residents, who have been urged . to leave their homes if they suffer health conditions that could be . affected by the thick smoke in the air. So far . the fire, which is mainly centered in the Stanislaus National Forest, . has destroyed two homes and seven outbuildings since Saturday. Battle: Reinforcements are due to join the 1,300 firefighters already tackling the Rim Fire . Tactics: A firefighter uses a chainsaw to clear brush and stop the fire spreading . However, it is starting to spread to private land and is about five miles from the northwest outer edge of the national park. The blaze is threat to about 2,500 homes and businesses in the popular vacation spot. The private summer community of Pine Mountain Lake, which has a population of 2,800, has been voluntarily evactuated, along with several other campgrounds. Yosemite, which spans 750,000 acres, attract nearly 4 million visitors last year, according to the park website. Park officials were forced to stop . traffic on Highway 120, one of four access routes to the park, on . Tuesday because of the fire. 'This is typically a very busy time for us until Labor Day, so it's definitely affecting business not having the traffic come through to Yosemite,' Britney Sorsdahl, manager at the Iron Door Saloon and Grill in Groveland, five miles from the fire, said. Close: Thick clouds of smoke rise into the clear skies over Hetch Hetchy reservoir in another part of the park . Burned: A sign warning of fire hazards is damaged after the blaze swept through Buck Meadows . Eerie: Smouldering remains of a forest burned by the Rim Fire . Christina Wilkinson, who lives in Pine Mountain Lake near Groveland, said: 'Usually during summer, it's swamped with tourists, you can't find parking downtown. Now, the streets are empty. All we see is firefighters, emergency personnel and fire trucks.' Tourist cabins on a Groveland ranch directly in the fire's path have been evacuated and a couple of buildings on the site burned down. 'This fire, it's killing our financial picture. This is our high season and it has gone to nothing, we're really hurting,' Corinna Loh, who owns the Spinning Wheel Ranch and Iron Door Saloon, told the Modesto Bee. She added that most of her employees had left the small town of about 600 people. At an emergency meeting in Tuolumne County supervisors voted to ask Governor Jerry Brown to declare a state of emergency and free funds for the firefight. There are no immediate plans to close the park, Yosemite ranger Scott Gediman said, adding that the sky above the park had been clear of smoke on Thursday. Huge task: Firefighters are overwhelmed by the extent of the blaze . Dramatic: The sun sets in heavy smoke near Groveland, California, as the fire rages for the fifth day . Intense: The out of control blaze is a threat to 2,500 homes outside the park . Control: A crew member tries to deal with a back fire in Groveland . The cause of the Rim Fire is under investigation. The U.S Forest Service, the leading wildfire-fighting agency, is running out of money to deal with the large number of fires this year. It has spend $967 million so far this year and was down to just $50 million - enough to cover just a few days of fighting blazes - before it was forced to divert $600 million in funds from other areas too boost its reserve.","The fire has spread inside the border of Yosemite National Park .

With summer in full swing, celebrities and the British public alike are baring more flesh as the temperature climbs. Hot pants are getting shorter and crop tops more skimpy as we dress to beat the heat. Rihanna and Miley Cyrus may rock the look, but showing off your 'underbutt' - showing off too much buttock in . a pair of tiny shorts - doesn't find favour with everyone. The underbutt may be this summer's biggest trend, but it's also just been voted one of the season's biggest . fashion disasters in a new poll. A . quarter of women aged 18 - 24 questioned admit to having shown a bit too much . underbutt at one time or another, and now describe it as a 'faux pas.' Cheeky: Rihanna (left) and Miley Cyrus (right) love to show off a bit of underbutt - but now the look has been voted one of the biggest fashion disasters of the summer . Also included in the top ten summer style crimes were visible panty lines, muffin tops and too much cleavage. And, while London may . be one of the fashion capitals of the world, its experimental nature leads locals to commit more fashion felonies than any other region. But, as Heikki Haldre, chief executive and . co-founder at virtual fitting room provider Fits.me, who carried out the . survey, points out: 'Fashion is not responsible for fashion faux pas: . the problem is that we all-too-frequently choose clothes that don’t fit . our body size or shape. 'Three-quarters of all the fashion . mistakes that women make are actually related to how well their clothes . fit, and two-thirds of men’s mistakes too.' Of the women polled, 84 per cent admit to having committed a serious fashion faux pas. And men are just as guilty: a quarter of men under-35 have yanked their trousers too high, the outfit offence made infamous by Simon Cowell. Style crimes: Tulisa shows us her underbutt (left), which featured in the top five most hated looks - muffin tops (right) were also loathed by the public . Britons abroad are well-known for . their taste transgressions, and it seems summer brings out the . exhibitionist in us: one in 10 women have worn bikinis that are too . small, while a third admit to wearing skirts that are too short. One in five 35 - 55 year old men admit to channeling their inner Tom . Daley by wearing tiny swimming trunks. Haldre thinks there could be a simple explanation for all this: '36 per cent of shoppers recently told us that they use in-store fitting rooms less than they did just three years ago.' Male mistakes: A quarter of men have admitted to wearing their trousers too high like Simon Cowell (left) and one in five love tiny Speedos like Tom Daley (right) - both voted top fashion crimes . 'We’re also a self-conscious nation, with 18 per cent of consumers saying they dislike leaving their cubicle in order to see themselves in a public, full-length mirror. 'And we are buying more clothes online where it’s often not even possible to ""try before you buy"". 'Perhaps retailers need to put more effort, online and offline, into making the trying-on of clothes a pleasurable part of the shopping experience again?' Hmm. Are we too shy and retiring to look in the mirror at home, too? Or maybe the flesh-flashing girls and the boys bursting out of their budgie smugglers know exactly what they look like - and don't really care what anyone else thinks.

An elderly Muslim cleric in South Florida has been sentenced to 25 years in federal prison for funneling tens of thousands of dollars to the Pakistani Taliban. U.S. District Judge Robert Scola imposed the sentence Friday on 78-year-old Hafiz Khan, who was convicted in March of four terror support-related charges. Khan was arrested in May 2011 on two counts of conspiracy and two counts of providing material support to terrorists. Terrorist backer: Hafiz Khan, right, was sentenced to 25 years in prison today for helping to finance the Pakistani Taliban . Prosecutors drew on hundreds of FBI records of Khan's phone conversations in which he praised Taliban attacks  including the failed 2011 attempt to detonate a bomb in Times Square. Khan also tried to solicit money to finance the Pakistani Taliban from a man who turned out to be an informant - all of which was recorded on tape. During the trial, Khan said he only pretended to support the Taliban so he could get the money to send it to his family and a school he helped found there. 'This is not supporting terrorist,' Khan's lawyer Khurrum Wahid said in his closing argument. 'This is an old guy running a scam, who got scammed.' In total, the evidence showed that he arranged to send about $50,000 over three years to Pakistan and prosecutors said it was used to fund violent attacks against both the U.S. and Paksitani targets. The jury didn't buy his story and found him guilty last March on all four charges, each carrying a maximum 15-year sentence. Khan's two sons were also arrested and charged for funneling money into the country, but their cases were dropped due to lack of evidence. Three others were charged in the case, but were in Pakistan and remain free as the country does not extradite to the U.S. Khan was imam at a Miami mosque before he and two of his sons were arrested in 2011.

Premiership giants Manchester City have the Etihad Stadium, Arsenal have the Emirates Stadium, and now a small club from Wales have jumped on the sponsorship bandwagon after renaming their home - The Cigg-e Stadium. Fans of Merthyr Town FC are fuming after the club announced details of a £60,000 three-year sponsorship deal with electronic cigarette firm Cigg-e. Already suffering from a slight persecution complex - they are nicknamed the Martyrs - diehard supporters fear their new name will cause rival fans to roll-up with laughter. Fresh lungs: Cigg-e has breathed new life into Merthyr Town FC with a new sponsorship deal . Fuming: Fans are less than impressed with the news their beloved ground is to be renamed The Cigg-e Stadium . Despite the club describing the development as 'fantastic news' on its website, the fans have not exactly reached for the celebratory cigars. Dave Williams, 57, said: 'We should have stubbed this out before signing the sponsorship deal. 'We will be the laughing stock. Arsenal calling their stadium the Emirates and man City the Etihad is one thing, but the Cigg-e Stadium sounds just daft.' Liz Thomas, another fan, 50, added: 'We will be the butt of everyone's jokes. I can't image fans saying ""are you goiing down the Cigg-e ground?"" or ""see you at the Cigg-e"". 'We'll have all the cigarette jokes about signing Players, getting a Regal reception and scoring from a Lucky Strike.' Merthyr is one of the poorest towns in the country where the average age of someone taking up smoking is just nine. New name: Part of the deal involves the ground being renamed The Cigge-e Stadium . Thirty per cent of the town suffers from a long-term illness, many of which are smoking related. Cigg-e, which distributes electronic cigarettes from its Cardiff base, is about to open a shop in the town. Operations manager Scott Davies said: 'Cigg-e are delighted to have . entered into a partnership with Merthyr Town FC, and that they are . looking forward to a long and prosperous relationship both on and off . the field.' The club's commercial manager Brent Carter added: 'This a first of its kind deal for Merthyr Town FC, and this will . considerably aid the long term stability of the club.' The team, which has a proud 105-year history and currently plays in the Division One South and West League, will continue to light-up the pitch at the less controversially named Penydarren Park until September. Medicine: E-cigarette's such as this one here are to be reclassified . Last month the Government announced electronic cigarettes were to be classified as medicines in a bid to tighten up regulation. Although they contain nicotine, electronic cigarettes are marketed as being less harmful than real ones because they do not contain harmful toxins such as tar. But research has shown the levels of nicotine each e-cigarette contains varies from batch to batch. By regulating the products, they will have to come up to a required standard. It is estimated about 1.3million people use e-cigarettes in the UK, which are inhaled like normal cigarettes, although the vapour is mainly made up of water. Fearing the unknown consequences, some countries, such as Brazil and Mexico, have banned them altogether, even though actual tobacco remains legal. The USA, already vehemently opposed to smoking with many states banning it in public places, is also sceptical about the supposed benefits of electronic cigarettes. Boston is the latest city to be considering introducing an outright ban on people using them. In 2011 bans preventing under 18s and people using them in the workplace were brought in.","Fans fuming after club announced new stadium would be called Cigg-e .

Many struggle to find a housemate who is the perfect match for them. But one intriguing advert that offered a rent-free room in exchange for the lodger 'dressing and speaking' like a walrus was so successful that it has inspired a Hollywood film. The Gumtree post described how a home owner had spent months 'constructing a realistic walrus costume' that his lodger would have to wear for a minimum of two hours a day, while communicating in the 'voice of a walrus' and eating fish that was thrown to them by their landlord. The request was inspired by the poster's 'fulfilling friendship' with a walrus called Gregory while he lived otherwise alone on an island just west of Alaska. Now having moved to Brighton to enjoy their retirement, the landlord wants to revive the 'most fascinating years of their life' by recreating the relationship with someone who could realistically portray a walrus. The extraordinary advert caught the eye of many after it was posted on June 11 and went viral, with the landlord saying they had been inundated with people keen to try on the outfit and audition for the role. And one high-profile person who was enchanted by the advert was director Kevin Smith, who has been inspired to pen a Hammer horror-style film about the advert. The director, whose films include Clerks and Mallrats, plans to set 'Tusk' in Canada, the Independent reported. The plot revolves around a 'mad scientist intending to sew some hapless lodger into counterfeit blubber', according to the newspaper. Quentin Tarantino and Michael Parks are being considered for roles in Tusk, the Metro reported. The request was inspired by the poster's 'fulfilling friendship' with a walrus called Gregory . The Gumtree advertised for a flatmate with the proviso that they dress like a walrus . The unusual request that started the film began with: 'Among the many things I have done in my life is to spend three years alone on St. Lawrence Island. 'These were perhaps the most intense and fascinating years of my life, and I was kept in companionship with a walrus whom I named Gregory. 'Never have I had such a fulfilling friendship with anyone, human or otherwise, and upon leaving the island I was heartbroken for months. 'This is a position I am prepared to offer for free (eg: no rent payable) on the fulfillment of some conditions. 'I have, over the last few months, been constructing a realistic walrus costume, which should fit most people of average proportions, and allow for full and easy movement in character. 'To take on the position as my lodger you must be prepared to wear the walrus suit for approximately two hours each day (in practice, this is not two hours every day - I merely state it here so you are able to have a clear idea of the workload). 'Whilst in the walrus costume you must be a walrus - there must be no speaking in a human voice, and any communication must entail making utterances in the voice of a walrus - I believe there are recordings available on the web - to me, the voice is the most natural thing I have ever heard. 'Other duties will involve catching and eating the fish and crabs that I will occasionally throw to you whilst you are being the walrus. 'With the exception of this, you will be free to do whatever you choose, and will have a spacious double room, complete run of the house.' A new lodger has been found, the advert later said.","A home owner had spent months 'constructing a realistic walrus costume'

A hotelier has demanded an ancient clock stop chiming every 15 because it is keeping his customers awake. The town hall clock in Bishops Castle in Shropshire which has rung every 15 minutes since the 18th century is now causing a storm on Facebook after one hotelier complained about the noise . The small market town in Shropshire attracts thousands of tourists every year, but Henry Hunter, of The Castle Hotel, has requested the traditional tolls be halted after dark. The bells! Residents of Bishops Castle in Shropshire are divided over whether the bells should be silenced after dark . He says guests have told him that however much they love the town they will never return to Bishops Castle because of the clock’s 24-hour chiming. He said: 'If anyone can come up with a genuine reason why the town clock should chime every 15 minutes throughout the night then I would like to hear it. Surly it would be beneficial to everyone living in close proximity to the clock to have it chime at most on the hour throughout the dead of night?' But his request to the town council has been criticised by many residents who say the chimes are 'part of Bishops Castle’s character'. Using their Facebook site the town council asked locals to leave their opinion on the clock asking the question: 'Does the noise of chiming bother people throughout the night or is it part of the ‘deal’ of living in a rural town with an historic town hall and clock?' The Castle Hotel owner says guests have told him that however much they love the town they will never return to Bishops Castle because of the bells . Within days they received hundreds of responses with the majority in favour of keeping the chimes. Olli Moon wrote: 'I always sleep better when I can hear it. It is definitely part of the town and it would be a real shame to see it go.' Tracey Griffiths added: 'It is definitely part of the town. I love the chimes.' Carol Woodhouse posted: 'I love the chimes. When I moved back here after 18 months away I really knew that I was home again when I heard the chimes. It has been a part of my growing up.' But some have sympathy with Henry Hunter and the guests who stay at The Castle Hotel. Benedict Rodway wrote: 'I agree that it is part of town, but ""never annoyed anybody?"" Try having your bedroom 25 feet from it!' Using their Facebook site the town council has asked locals to leave their opinion on the clock because of the controversial chimes . Glyn Foulkes posted: 'I doubt anyone would support complete removal of the chimes as they are part of the fabric of Bishops Castle life, however surely the people who are closest to it are those affected the most at four in the morning. I would be interested to know why turning off the chimes between 1am and 6am is such a big deal as most of us are then asleep.' Jane Carroll, a town councillor who runs a bed and breakfast in the town, has described claims that the clock chimes are having a detrimental effect on the local economy as 'absolute rubbish'. She said: 'Bishops Castle has become increasingly popular as a holiday destination over the past 20 years and numbers continue to grow. Yet all this time the Town Hall clock has been donging away every 15 minutes, day and night. 'Bishops Castle Tourism has worked hard on tourism development over the years and has always had a policy of attracting visitors for what the town and area have to offer rather than changing things to suit visitors specifically. Any initiatives, be it good public footpaths, better signage, an excellent town website, promotion of town events and festivals and, of course, the renovation of the Town Hall should benefit residents as much as visitors. 'Altering the chiming of the Town Hall clock would go completely against this principle as most town centre residents want the clock chimes to stay as they are. They are a familiar and friendly background sound to our lives and, for many people, a very useful time keeper. Without the quarters, the chimes would be useless as the latter. 'Instead of complaining about the chimes, the accommodation providers and residents should be celebrating our historic Town Hall clock. It is part of the character of Bishops Castle and appreciated by many.' The future of Bishops Castle’s Town Hall clock will be discussed at a meeting of the full council on September 10.","Market town Bishops Castle attracts thousands of tourists .

Jamelia Humphreys was found guilty of head-butting a 10 year old girl who was able to identify her attacker after seeing her on the programme . A tearaway star of Channel 4 documentary ‘Skint’ headbutted a ten-year-old girl - but was caught because her victim recognised her from the telly. Jobless Jamelia Humphreys - a teenage mother who had her own baby taken from her by social services - attacked the child whilst she was appearing every week on television. Foul-mouthed Humphreys, 18, was asked to curb her language several times by security guards at court, also pleaded guilty to stealing £7 worth of condoms from a pharmacy, in her hometown of Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire. Humphreys, who was 16 when Skint was filmed, is now barred from entering Scunthorpe town centre. Wayward Humphreys, who is waiting to be sentenced for these offences and also for assaulting a woman police officer, said outside court: 'I wish I’d never appeared on Skint now, it’s like everyone knows my business and who I am. 'It’s like I’m the Queen’s daughter or something, but I’m not no [sic] princess.' Humphreys, who turned 18 just three weeks ago, was before magistrates frequently as a juvenile. Humphreys arrived at North Lincolnshire Magistrates’ Court 1hr 40min late for her 2pm hearing because she had lost her phone the previous day, and said: 'I just forgot I had to be at court, I mean, I can’t be expected to remember everything.' She had fled the court at an earlier trial where she was found guilty of head-butting the ten-year-old girl on 31 May. A warrant was issued for her arrest and she was re-bailed for Thursday’s appearance. On that occasion magistrates’ heard from the victim, who was forced to come to court to give evidence on her 11th birthday. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Wayward Humphreys, who is waiting to be sentence, appeared on the programme when she was only 16 . Outlining the case, prosecutor Marie Harpin said the incident took place in Scunthorpe. She . said: 'The complainant was stood with her friend when the defendant got . out of a car and asked one girl whether she was being bullied. 'The defendant turned on the group and became abusive before accusing the complainant of smirking. 'She then headbutted her on the right side of her forehead. 'She began to cry and then ran home.' The headbutt left the girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, with red marks on her forehead and a lump. The controversial programme was screened in May and June of this year. Dubbed the real-life version of Shameless, in which Frank Gallagher fiddles his benefits and spends all his money on drugs and alcohol – Skint shocked viewers with its examination of a housing estate. Skint was a controversial documentary charting life on the Westcliffe estate, where crime, drugs and poverty are rife, promised social insight shot through with coarse humour. But there was nothing funny about the portrait of badly broken Britain. The youngsters talking to the cameras saw life as vicious, joyless and funded by state handouts. Those who are often maligned for their lifestyle offered their own story and show the real impact of unemployment. The police interview with the 10-year-old victim was played out in court. She said: 'I was walking home with my friends and this girl called Jamelia off the TV came out of a car and asked another girl (in a different group) if we were bullying her and she said ""yes"". 'Then Jamelia said to all of us that ‘I am going to slap every single one of you’. 'Then Jamelia said to my friend that if she touched this girl then she is going to come to me (Jamelia) and I am going to touch you all to see how you like it. 'She thought I was laughing and asked me how I would like it if she hit me so she stood up and went like that.' The girl indicated to the officer that Humphreys headbutted her. She said that her attacker issued further threats to her. Asked how she felt after the incident, the complainant said: 'I was very upset. 'It made me feel really scared and not want to go out on the street again. I am really sad when I think about it and it makes me upset. 'When she sees me again face-to-face I think that she might hurt me.' She said on a scale of one to 10, the pain she felt was a nine. Chris Dickens, representing Humphreys said the defence case was that his client was not present at the scene and did not assault the girl. Scunthorpe Magistrates' Court heard how the teenager's victim felt scared and not want to go out on the street again after the attack . Mr Dickens said to the young girl: 'I have been told by Jamelia that she said she was not there on that day. Could you be confused?' The girl replied: 'No.' Mr Dickens added: 'You knew her from the TV programme Skint?' She again replied: 'Yes.' The court heard Humphreys had previous convictions for battery - twice in 2009, in 2010 and in 2012. In 2009 the court heard she argued with a female before punching her in the face. Later in year, she grabbed the complainant by the hair, pulled her back before kicking her in the head several times. In 2010 she had a further conviction for battery in which she hit the complainant several times. Then in 2012 she had another offence of battery when she kicked, punched and stamped on another person. At Thursday’s hearing Humphreys pleaded guilty to the theft of condoms, worth £7, from Weldrake Pharmacy on 27 May. On 25 July she also attacked a WPC as she executed her duties. Magistrates adjourned sentencing for the preparation of a probation report, and granted Humphreys bail on the conditions that she does not contact her ten-year-old victim or another named child and does not enter the town centre. She will be sentenced on September 13.","Jamelia Humphreys, 18, headbutted girl in Scunthorpe for 'laughing'

Kelly McManus says she lost her confidence after having her first child at the age of 21 and struggling to lose her 'mummy tummy' An aspiring actress was given a £5,000 tummy tuck on the NHS so she could pursue her dream of becoming the next Julia Roberts. Kelly McManus said she lost her confidence after having her first child at the age of 21 and struggling to lose her ‘mummy tummy’. The part-time beautician, who earns £7,000 a year, could not afford the operation and begged doctors to get rid of her bulge. After 18 months of visiting her GP, Miss McManus was referred to a surgeon for the taxpayer-funded operation. The single mother-of-three, who once appeared on Jeremy Kyle, said: ‘My new tummy has changed my life. 'I feel like a new woman. I can’t wait to start acting lessons now. Who knows, maybe I could be the next Julia Roberts.’ But on an acting website Miss McManus admits she has no experience, writing: ‘The last acting I did was 11 years ago at school! 'Although I did get an A grade in Drama so I can’t be that bad.’ The 27-year-old believes the operation has actually saved the NHS cash, claiming that it would have cost the organisation more money to treat her depression. She said: ‘After my first child my stomach never went back to its normal size. Then after my third child the midwife said, “You do know that your stomach muscles have separated from your bulge.” ‘It looked like I was still pregnant and people even asked me, “How far on are you?” It was just so embarrassing. I lost all my confidence because of it. It was leaving me depressed and ruining my sex life.’ Miss McManus said she can't wait to start acting lessons, adding 'Who knows, maybe I could be the next Julia Roberts' The operation to remove the excess skin on Miss McManus's abdomen was carried out at Bradford Royal Infirmary (pictured) last month . In desperation, Miss McManus began . investigating cosmetic surgery. She said: ‘I looked online and realised I . couldn’t afford the £5,000 cost so the NHS was my only hope. ‘At . first the doctor recommended physiotherapy and exercise. I was seeing . her for a couple of months and she said she couldn’t repair my stomach . muscles.’ Eventually, . Miss McManus was referred to a surgeon. She said: ‘I was scared because . I have never had surgery before but I knew it would change my life.’ Controversial: Jodie Cunningham had her breasts enlarged to 36DD on the NHS - and now wants them reduced, as well as compensation . The three-hour operation to remove the excess skin on her abdomen was carried out at Bradford Royal Infirmary last month. Miss McManus told The Sun: . ‘I am more confident and a lot happier than I was. It changed my . outlook on life. It’s only been four weeks and the scars are still . healing but I just feel absolutely brilliant.’ But campaigners were outraged at the decision to fund Miss McManus’s operation when cuts are being made elsewhere in the NHS. A spokesman from The TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘It’s ridiculous that the NHS pays for procedures that are not based on strict medical needs. Patients missing out on vital drugs and treatment will find this deeply unfair.’ It follows the case of 23-year-old Josie Cunningham, who had £4,800 breast enlargement surgery on the NHS in January after complaining she had been bullied over her flat 32A chest. But after undergoing the operation, the aspiring model from Leeds said her 36DD breasts had made her the target of online abuse. Miss Cunningham then said she would like a reduction and compensation. She claimed she was not properly consulted before her operation and wanted compensation for clinical negligence and emotional distress. Miss Cunningham, who works in telesales, consulted no-win, no-fee lawyers so she can ‘take [the NHS] for every penny’. She said: ‘I want in excess of £10,000. Anything I can get over that is a bonus.’ Miss Cunningham told The Sun: ‘I was rushed through the process. I didn’t actually ask for 36DD — I would have been happier with a B cup. ‘But they told me that because I didn’t have any breast tissue I’d have to go for bigger breasts. They haven’t helped me one bit. In fact, my life is ruined.’ Meanwhile, just a few miles away from . her home in Leeds, two-year-old cerebral palsy sufferer Oliver Dockerty . had been turned down for funding for an operation which could allow him . to walk. Thankfully, after reading about his . plight in the Daily Mail, generous readers helped to raise the £24,000 . needed for Oliver to have his operation privately. Cosmetic surgery is provided by the NHS only if there is a clinical need . Cosmetic procedures are not normally done on the NHS unless doctors decide there is a clinical need. This . decision is taken at a local level, by the Primary Care Trust (PCT), on . the basis of reports submitted by a patient's doctors. PCTs set their own criteria according to what, in their view, are the health needs of the local community. For . cosmetic surgery, the usual protocol is that the PCT must decide there . is some kind of clinical, ie health, need for the operation to be funded . on the NHS.  Simply wanting to look nicer in itself is not reason . enough. Leeds Primary Care Trust, also known as NHS Leeds, offers a . list of cosmetic procedures that may be available on its website.  They . include breast augmentation, breast reduction, eyelid surgery . (blepharoplasty), and rhytidectomy (wrinkle removal including face . lift). It says these may be available 'providing certain criteria can be met', and lists the criteria. The . criteria required for breast augmentation include suffering from . certain rare syndromes, severe asymmetry (more than two cup sizes . difference), or lumpectomy that results in deformity. Rare cases, . however, such as Ms Cunningham's, have to be go through the Individual . Funding Request process, in which each case is decided upon its . individual merits.","Kelly McManus lost confidence after struggling to lose her 'mummy tummy'

Fresh impala meat was clearly too much for the young male leopard to resist, as it leapt down from its tree and approached the crocodile at the side of the road. After a few cautious sniffs, it apparently decided this was a dinner date for two, and took a big bite - inches from the croc's jaws. Crocodiles have been known to kill leopards, but this easy-going animal simply continued to gnaw on its prey with nothing but a brief - though disgruntled - glance at the big cat.

This is the moment a masked robber brandished a running chainsaw to frighten off anyone who may try to intervene while his gang mates raided a jewellery shop. The robbery, which took place in Wakefield in April last year,was just one of a series of heists across West Yorkshire in which the thieves took off with an estimated £250,000 worth of cash and jewellery. Leeds Crown court heard how the gang of four men used chainsaws, pickaxes, sledgehammers and knives during the violent raids which have cost them 57 years behind bars. One of the gang members stood outside Mr Hussain's shop in West Yorkshire wielding a running chainsaw to scare off any passers-by that tried to intervene during the raid . In one attack, three of the men plundered £150,000 of stock and £4,000 of cash in just four minutes after forcing shop owner, Nasir Hussain to the ground. The masked robbers smashed display cases with pickaxes and shoveled the jewels into a skip sack  while their partner-in-crime stood outside, waving the chainsaw around in a bid to frighten off passers-by. Mr Hussain tried to chase the perpetrators after they made their getaway in a stolen Audi but was stopped short after they switched vehicles. The stolen car was found nearby having been set on fire. Before ransacking Mr Hussain's shop, WS Jewellers, the group had already robbed Sona Jewellers in Huddersfield using similar tactics. The thieves arrived at the store in a stolen Range Rover on February 25 last year carrying hammers. They transferred the expensive jewellery into builders' bags before taking off. 'Cold-blooded thieves': John Morrison (left) from Guildersome was jailed for nine years, while Patrick Lowther (right) from Rothwell faces 16 years behind bars . Garner Smith (left) and Steven Barker (right) who are both from Bradford have been jailed for 16 years each for conspiracy to rob . Their next target was Assad Jewellers in Batley on March 8 where, armed with pieces of wood and a large knife, the men forced their way in by reversing Volkswagen Transporter through the door. The owners managed to prevent them from coming in, but one member of staff suffered a slash to his arm and required hospital treatment. The court heard how the masked men also used sledgehammers during the terrifying attacks. Gang members Patrick 'Mandy' Lowther, 33, Steven Barker, 35, and Garner Smith, 33, were all jailed for 16 years after being convicted of conspiracy to rob. Fellow plotter John Boy Morrison, 40, was jailed for nine years after the judge ruled he had less involvement than the others. Judge Tom Bayliss QC said: 'The target of this conspiracy was a number of Asian jewellery shops in the area of West Yorkshire. 'The distinction between such shops and high street jewellers is they are often in quiet residential areas and often occupied by (lone) proprietors. 'In other words they present a soft target. But these yield valuable rewards to men like you.' The men from Guildersome, Rothwell and Bradford denied conspiracy to rob but were convicted after a three week trial. Nasir Hussain was forced to the ground by three of the thieves while they raided his shop, WS Jewellers in Wakefield. The group of men stole £150,000 worth of Mr Hussain's stock and £4,000 in cash . Judge Bayliss said: 'You knew exactly which part of the premises was most vulnerable. You knew what to go for in the shop. 'These were highly sophisticated, highly professional, well organised and carefully planned robberies.' After the case, Mr Hussain, 38, said: 'I was in shock because it happened so quickly and these guys were so professional. 'I realised there was somebody outside in the street who had got a running chainsaw. I could hear it and he was waving it. The father-of-four added: 'They are cold-blooded thieves. They are taking somebody’s livelihood. In four minutes they just took everything away. They got what they deserved.' Det Insp Paul Harrison, of Wakefield CID, said it was the first time in his 30-year career he had seen a chainsaw being used as a weapon of fear. 'There were a number of people around the shop. One certainly tried to approach this man. 'This chainsaw was actually activated. I have no doubt whatsoever the person with the chainsaw would have caused harm if they’d got closer.'","The gang of four carried out a string of raids on backstreet jewellers across West Yorkshire last year .

A conman who cheated three victims out of thousands of pounds to feed his gambling addiction has walked free from court. 'Flattering' fraudster Craig Johnson was jailed for 10 months for a string of crimes that included burgling a girlfriend's house and stealing the identity of a friend. But the 26-year-old, described by a judge at Newcastle Crown Court as 'mean' yesterday, is already back on the streets having served his sentence on remand, a situation de`scribed as 'disgraceful' by one of his victims. Fraudster: Craig Johnson was described as 'mean' in court by a judge, but he is already back out on the streets having served his sentence while on remand . The court heard Johnson had broken into the home of girlfriend Jade Lewins in January, stealing her iPad and Barclaycard, which he then used to buy a washing machine costing £427. Judge Jeremy Freedman said he had charmed Miss Lewins to take out contracts for three mobile phones in his name, racking up costs of £133. He promised to pay her back, but never did. The serial scam artist stole from another girlfriend, Jodie Clarke, when he offered to take her £300 broken necklace to be repaired. She never saw it again. Cold-hearted Johnson, who was supported in court by his new wife, also persuaded Miss Clarke to take out a mobile phone contract in his name, but never paid a penny towards the bills. Tearful: Jade Lewins said Collins had ruined her life . Johnson then stole the identity of an acquaintance, Joseph Jackson, taking out a £599 loan from the Money Shop in his name. Mr Jackson was clueless to what had happened when he started receiving payment demands for the loan. In total, Johnson stole more than £5,500 from his three victims. When he was arrested in March this year, he was found to be in possession of £900 cash. Johnson, of Salisbury Street, Blyth, Northumberland, pleaded guilty to five counts of fraud, theft and handling stolen goods. Defending Johnson, Andrew Mark explained his crimes as being the result of a gambling addiction. But prosecuting, Alexander Burns said he had been 'charming and flattering'. Judge Freedman said to Johnson: 'During the summer of last year you behaved as a fraudster, known colloquially as a conman to fund your gambling addiction. These were mean offences. 'You took advantage of the goodwill of people you had met, people who thought they were engaging in a meaningful relationship built on trust. You abused that trust.' Speaking outside of court, a tearful Jade Lewins said: 'I’m still paying the phone bills now. Five-and-a-half months for ruining my life is disgraceful. 'There has been times when I couldn’t even afford to feed my child because of him.'","Sentence handed down to fraudster described as 'disgraceful' by victim .

Their new enclosure at Bristol Zoo Gardens - which is being completed in three phases - will boast climbing facilities, ropes, play equipment and an indoor pool. Renovation work began in July last year and the first phase has just been completed, meaning the zoo's seven western lowland gorillas can move in. Scroll down for video . Primates: A family of gorillas at Bristol Zoo Gardens have been moved into their new home, which features an overhead glass panel to allow visitors to watch them walking above . Up close: The new enclosure allows visitors to the zoo get up close and personal with the primates . Eying it up: The glass enclosure allows for much better viewing of the magnificent apes . Communication: The builders and keepers had to work together as the refurbishment was carried out while the gorillas were in situ . Glass ceiling: Visitors can now get see the apes from all angles including underneath . Keepers say the gorillas have already been enjoying their new enclosure, which is double the size of their last home. A new atrium-style glass entrance has been fitted, along with an overhead glass panel allowing visitors to watch the gorillas walking above. Kukena, who was born at the zoo two years ago, has already been spotted using the glass to slide on and perform roly-polys. Lynsey Bugg, assistant curator of mammals at the zoo, said the project had been tricky to manage as the house had been rebuilt while the gorillas lived there. 'Good communication between the construction team and the keepers has been essential,' she said. 'The builders have been brilliant at letting us know in advance the schedule of the build, so that we could prepare our activities around it. New home: Keepers say the gorillas have already been enjoying their new enclosure, which is double the size of their last home . Silverback: Bristol Zoo Gardens is home to a family of seven Gorillas . Playful: Kukena, who was born at the zoo two years ago, has already made full use of the new facilities . King of the swingers: Kukena practices her climbing skills on one of the many new ropes . 'We have worked hard to help the builders, whilst maintaining the needs of the gorillas, which has been no mean feat.' Bristol Zoo Gardens decided to upgrade the enclosure to help cater for the family of gorillas, which has been growing in recent years. The first phase of work was the largest part of the transformation, as it involved a re-design of the right side of the original building. Keepers had to keep 32-stone Jock and his family away from the building work, which was difficult in winter weather as the gorillas could not go outside. The seven gorillas were seen to stick close together when work began but relaxed after a couple of weeks. More to come: The new enclosure is being completed in three phases and will boast climbing facilities, ropes, play equipment and an indoor pool . Ms Bugg added: 'After a short period of trying to suss out their new housemates, the gorillas soon became accustomed to watching the builders go about their work. 'Jock, our 30-year-old silverback, could quite often be found watching the builders and keepers quickly learnt that Jock liked to see what was going on and oversee the work. 'Salome, mum to Kukena our almost two-year-old gorilla, also enjoyed having the builders to watch every day.' The first phase of the gorilla house will be open to the public tomorrow, with the two other phases due for completion by early 2014.","Family of gorillas upgraded to new home to cope with growing brood .

A reveller accused of drink driving has escaped punishment after magistrates ruled he wasn’t a 'road user' - because he was on an electric skateboard. Remi Barban, 33, was picked up by police officers after they spotted him dangerously weaving from side to side on the road riding his battery-powered board. The website developer was stunned when police arrested him and charged him with drink driving. Mr Barban knew he had had one too many, but was convinced he was not breaking the law by hoping on his skateboard home. Cleared: Remi Barban, 33, pictured with his electric skateboard, was found not guilty of drink driving after magistrates ruled that an electric skateboard is not a type of motor vehicle . It took a pointless court case - costing taxpayers a whopping £650 - for an official decision to be made on whether the remote controlled skateboard should be classified as a motor vehicle. Magistrates deliberated for 90 minutes before deciding Barban was not a 'road user' and as a result could not be found guilty of any driving offences. Presiding magistrate Stephanie Challinor said: 'We’re not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that a reasonable person would say one of its users would be a road user.' Mr Barban, of Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, took to his skateboard after being banned from driving for 20 months last November. Bury St Edmunds Magistrates’ Court heard Mr Barban was found with 86 micrograms of alcohol in 100ml of breath when he was stopped at just after 11.30pm on May 17. Prosecutor Sarah-Jane Atkins said police spotted Mr Barban 'weaving from one side of the road to the other'. Miss Atkins had argued that the motorised skateboard was 'really akin to a Go-Ped [an electric scooter]'. Legal wrangle: Eightball, the manufacturers of Mr Barban's electric skateboard, do warn their customers it is 'not legal' to ride an electric skateboard on a UK public highway . Mr Barban pleaded not guilty to driving with excess alcohol and driving whilst disqualified at a previous hearing and was found innocent on Tuesday. He claimed the fact that he was on the road was an 'isolated case' and that he felt 'obliged' to ride on the road because there was no pedestrian crossing nearby. Mr Barban told magistrates: 'Probably because I didn’t have all my sense, I forgot that there was a crossing further down the road.' The not guilty verdict came despite other courts previously ruling that Segways, Go-Peds and electric scooters all count as motor vehicles. Eightball, which manufacturers the board, say on their website it is 'not legal' to ride an electric skateboard on a UK public highway. The wrangle over whether a skateboard counts as being motorised or not is estimated to have cost £650 in court costs. The TaxPayers' Alliance today said a 'silly' amount of time and money had been wasted on Remi Barban's case. Cheif Executive Matthew Sinclair said: 'A silly amount of court time and money has been wasted on debating the nature of a skateboard. 'It's difficult to believe that this issue could not have been solved before going to court. 'Drink driving is a serious offence but this absurd case appears to demonstrate a lack of common sense from those involved.'","Remi Barban, 33, was arrested by police officers who spotted him weaving .

A schoolboy suffered a horrific ten-inch leg wound after being tackled during a football match by a player wearing bladed boots. Goalkeeper Kavan Ryan, 13, collapsed on the pitch when a fellow player sliced his leg open as he went in for a tackle with the bladed football boots. The teenager was rushed to hospital but the bleeding was so heavy his father thought he may have severed an artery and feared he may die of blood loss. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Injured: Kavan Ryan, 13, was rushed to hospital after he suffered a ten-inch wound to his leg when he was tackled by a player wearing bladed boots during a football match . Police are now investigating an allegation of assault following the incident. His father Rob Copestake, 48, said: 'I've never seen anything like that, and I've played a lot of football. 'My big fear was that it had hit a main artery and Kavan could've bled to death.' Kevan was playing in a friendly game between his team Codland Colts and Alvechurch Youth on August 14 when he suddenly collapsed. Shocked spectators ran on to the pitch to find the huge gash torn in his thigh after the tackle from an Alvechurch player who was wearing the controversial bladed boots. The match was abandoned as police and paramedics were called by the team's manager Andy Taylor, 41, and Kavan was rushed to Alexandra Hospital in Redditch, Worcestershire. Doctors needed to place ten large stitches in the deep wound and kept Kavan under observation for 24 hours. Recovering: Kavan Ryan needed ten large stitches to close up the wound and will now be scarred for life . The Alvechurch player who caused the injury was sent off for serious foul play but a senior FA official said the tackle was recorded as reckless rather than violent. West Mercia Police has confirmed they have launched an inquiry after the incident was logged as an assault. Officers have even seized the 13-year-old opposition striker's football boots as part of the investigation. So far no arrests have been made. Mr Copestake, who was on the touchline at Redditch's Abbey Stadium when his son's leg was sliced almost to the bone, is now calling for bladed studs to be banned. The supermarket worker, who lives with wife Samantha, 42, a nurse in Solihull, West Midlands, said: 'I was in a daze, to be honest. I cried. 'Kavan was such a brave lad. I think he was in shock, but he kept on telling the people around him, ""look after my dad"". He was worried about me. 'A lot of people felt physically sick. Even the linesman had to turn away because he felt ill. 'I just don't want any other youngster to go through this. 'I can't help thinking the injury . would not have been so severe if the other player was wearing good old . fashioned moulded studs. 'We don't know when Kavan will play again - he's hobbling at the moment. When it happened, he said he wanted to quit football. Concerned: Kavan Ryan with his father Rob Copestake who was worried the blade had severed an artery because there was so much blood . 'But it's a one-off injury, something like that will never happen to him again. We do know he will be scarred for life.' His . comments echo recently retired Manchester United manager Sir Alex . Ferguson who claimed Swansea defender Ashley Williams could have killed . star striker Robin van Persie when he kicked the ball at his head last . season. But schoolboy Kavan yesterday shrugged off the incident, which happened just 20 minutes into his debut for the club. Wound: The gash on Kavan's left leg before it was stitched up . He said: 'I'm OK really, I just can't wait to get back out on the pitch again. 'It's . just one of those things really. I ran out to smother the ball and he . came running through, didn't even slide, he just stamped on me. 'I got up and started hopping around and pulled my shorts up to just see my skin hanging off. 'That's when I started screaming.' Coldland Colts manager Andy Taylor, 41, believes the cut was just centimetres away from an artery. He said: 'It was literally centimetres away from an artery - that is how close it was to being something much more serious. 'I think bladed boots should be banned from kids' football. 'Kids wear them on paths and gravel and the blades become sharp, almost like a weapon.' The referee's report from the abandoned game said the tackle was a result of 'youthful over-enthusiasm'. A . spokesman for the Alvechurch club described the injury as 'terrible' but stressed there was no malice behind the challenge that caused it. He said: 'I think people reacted to the injury - and, yes, it was very bad. But it was not the result of violent play.' A spokesperson for West Mercia police said: 'We can confirm we are investigating an allegation of assault in relation to this incident. 'There have been no arrests made but the football boots the 13-year-old was wearing at the time have been seized as part of the investigation.' The horrific injury was similar to that caused to Manchester United star Wayne Rooney by the bladed boots of Fulham's Hugo Rodallega last season. Blades are meant to provide players with better grip than their studded counterparts . But the boots have come under fire for being both dangerous to player's opponents as well as to themselves. A study by researchers at Dundee University found that the traditional stud was safer in a series of tests involving amateur players. Researchers claimed the traditional stud helps to distribute the pressure being placed on a footballer's feet while the cleats increase the loading on the front of the foot where soccer stars are prone to metatarsal injuries. Meanwhile bladed boots were 'relatively more harmful' due to the unnatural increased loading under the lateral half of the foot. Professor Rami Abboud, of the university's Institute of Motion Analysis and Research, said: 'The additional pressures placed on that area of the foot predispose it to injury. 'Our study showed that studded boots can be considered safer, as the pressure distribution across the foot and the pattern of pressure progression mimicked the normal motif, whereas the same was not true of bladed boots.' In 2005, Sir Alex Ferguson called for the boots to be banned after Roy Keane broke a bone in his foot. Speaking at the time, he said: 'The shot of the injury shows the shape of a blade stud on Roy's foot. The bladed studs are a danger. 'We have strong views about this, we don't allow our players to wear them as they can cause serious injuries. 'We have photographs in the dressing room of some of the injuries caused by blades. Some of our academy boys had bad injuries, including some terrible facial injuries. 'Hopefully the fad will evaporate and they will think of something else.' But eight years on, bladed boots are still popular among both professional and amateur players.","Goalkeeper Kavan Ryan, 13, collapsed on .

"By . Sean Poulter . PUBLISHED: . 20:05 EST, 22 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:04 EST, 23 August 2013 . Millions of families have been misled over ‘bargain’ prices on sale items such as furniture and carpets, it has been revealed. Six high street retailers are accused of artificially inflating prices for a short period in order to exaggerate sale cuts. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has refused to name the firms but has demanded they sign legal undertakings to prevent customers paying too much for high value items such as three-piece suites, dining tables, flooring and beds. Six high street retailers are accused of artificially inflating prices for a short period in order to exaggerate sale cuts . The watchdog found ‘systematic’ examples of artificially inflated prices that were used as a benchmark figure to advertise bogus savings of 50 per cent or more. Another scam involved advertising apparently low prices, with claims that the product would become much more expensive after the sale was over. Firms also used unrealistic recommended retail prices, apparently set by manufacturers, to make the store’s charge look cheaper than it really was. The OFT found that stores would typically charge the original higher price on just five per cent of the products at a tiny number of stores. Very few items, if any, were sold at this original price. However, it was then used to set a benchmark for huge price reduction claims. In all cases, no explanation of how and when these higher prices were established was provided. The OFT has written to the six retailers asking them to stop using pricing practices that mislead consumers, giving them until autumn to respond. A study of 166 people by experts at consultants London Economics found that these retail tactics often fool customers into paying more . The investigation comes ahead of the bank holiday weekend, a busy trading period for home furnishing retailers often marked by heavy sales promotions. And it comes days after Tesco was fined £300,000 over a misleading half-price offer on strawberries in hundreds of stores around the country. OFT director Gaucho Rasmussen said: ‘OFT research has found that reference pricing can mislead consumers into thinking the item they have bought is of higher value and quality, pressure them to buy there and then so they don’t “miss out” on the deal and also impair their judgment, as buying an item immediately means they do not get the chance to search the market for the real best deals. ‘We have contacted a number of carpet and furniture retailers asking them to review their pricing practices and sign legally enforceable undertakings. ‘This bank holiday sale season we would recommend that consumers ask sales staff when and for how long the reference price was used and also how many sales they achieved at this price. ‘This will help them to determine whether they are getting a good deal.’ The move against the furniture stores is part of a wider crackdown by the OFT’s investigators on misleading prices. Other scams under the spotlight include so-called drip pricing, where customers are tempted by an apparently low headline price in the store, only to find that other compulsory charges follow. ‘Bait pricing’, when few or no items are actually available at the advertised discount, and ‘free’ offers that require a series of other fees will also be targeted. A study of 166 people by experts at consultants London Economics found that these retail tactics often fool customers into paying more. It found that ‘the worst culprits’ were  drip pricing and time-limited offers – a  ploy used often by furniture outlets to falsely claim  that a deal is available only for a  short period. Generally people ended up paying too much and failing to shop around for a better deal, they found.","The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has refused to name the firms .

Snake keeper: Pauline Wallace, seen carrying a Pets at Home bag, had 140 snakes in her 'modest' semi-detached home, a court heard . A mother kept 140 snakes in her semi-detached home and had another 20 dead ones in a freezer because she could not face burying them, a court heard. Pauline Wallace, 64, stored her collection of pets in old sweet tubs, plastic bins and vivariums that were stacked from floor to ceiling. The mother-of-one's 'snake colony' included blood pythons, carpet pythons, corn snakes, common boa constrictors and hypo-malanistic Boas. The court heard that they were discovered in the property in York when the RSPCA went to check up after a tip-off. Wallace also shared her 'modest' semi-detached property with her elderly mother and son. Inspectors found the dead snakes in a fridge freezer along with a dead cat, York Magistrates' Court was told. The mother was out shopping for more snakes when Inspector Heidi Cleaver and a local vet first called at her property. She told the RSPCA she had 'around 140' snakes - but admitted she had so many she had lost count. Inspector Cleaver told the court: 'The bedroom was quite small and was literally floor to ceiling with stacker boxes, some vivariums and smaller tubs.' She said the 'chaotic garage' was also filled floor to ceiling with snakes in containers. Inspector Cleaver opened one box and said: 'you were literally overwhelmed by the stench which can only be described as mouldy death'. The court heard Wallace was issued with a warning notice and several snakes were euthanised. She was given instructions to clean the vivariums, containers and tubs because the snakes were 'kept in filthy conditions detrimental to their wellbeing'. Phil Brown, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said: 'This large number of snakes was beyond the control of Mrs Wallace.' The RSPCA made follow-up inspections and on her third visit last August Inspector Cleaver looked inside the fridge freezer in the garage. 'Animal cruelty': Pauline Wallace, 65, even had 20 dead snakes in her freezer in her home (pictured) in York, the court heard . Rubbish: A discarded container in Pauline Wallace's front garden which is believed to be a vivarium that the snakes were kept in . She found 20 dead snakes inside together with a dead cat and Wallace said she was waiting for the right time to bury them in the back garden. Inspector Cleaver said she was concerned no action had been taken and a number of live snakes were removed to leave Wallace with a more manageable amount. A further inspection was carried out in September because there was no electricity supply to the garage which left it cold and more snakes were removed. Prosecutor Mr Brown said Wallace was interviewed on three separate occasions but did not believe she had done anything wrong in relation to the husbandry of the snakes. Wallace is facing 13 charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal and failing to ensure the welfare of her animals. She denies the offences. The trial continues.

A woman launched a hate campaign against her neighbour and filmed everything she did following a row over parking. Claire Sharpe, 33, fell out with Lisa Trumble, 47, shortly after Lisa moved next door in their cul-de-sac in Chippenham, Wiltshire. The pair had a brief dispute about parking outside their homes but Sharpe then began accusing her of a series of crimes. She rang police and claimed Lisa had stabbed her with a screwdriver and a set of keys. She also alleged that Ms Trumble smashed into her with a car and used her keys to scratch her vehicle. Police investigated all the allegations and dismissed them as lies and Sharpe was handed a harassment notice. But she then began using a video camera to film Lisa day and night - often recording her thorough her kitchen window. She set up a constant 'surveillance' of Lisa's front garden. She filmed everyone who entered Ms Trumble's home for nearly eight weeks. Now Sharpe has been given a restraining order by Chippenham Magistrates Court banning her from recording Lisa’s home address. Lisa, 47, who fled Zimbabwe with her children in 2001, said problems began with a parking dispute. She said: 'It has been a very unhappy nightmare. 'I’ve had so many different people knock on my door questioning me - that is really scary, even if you know you’ve done nothing wrong. 'It’s really difficult to cope. 'I am a quiet person, I don’t like conflict, I don’t understand why she’s doing it. 'Three . times she said I ran her over. It frightened me because I’d look out . the window and see police looking underneath my car and your heart . starts pounding. The pair had a brief dispute about parking outside their homes but Sharpe then began accusing her neighbour of running her over . Sharpe's hate campaign - which included filming her neighbour - was triggered by a row over parking . 'Once she phoned the police in front of me and said, ‘Help me, my neighbour’s stabbing me’ and they were out straight away.' Nick Barr, prosecuting, told the court that police said all allegations against Lisa had been investigated and there was no substance to any of them. He added: 'Miss Sharpe was issued with a harassment notice in February 2013 and within a short space of time that was breached by putting the camera at her . kitchen window directly pointing into Lisa Trumble’s garden, at whoever came to her front door. 'That caused some distress, as you would imagine.' Terry McCarthy, defending, told the court: 'The reason she set up a camcorder was that she got an email from the police advising her if she was concerned about the behaviour of her neighbour then she should film it. 'It isn't appropriate to use this court to deal with a neighbours' dispute.' But outside court, Sgt Connor said: 'People are given advice by the police to gather evidence of anti-social behaviour, but at no time has Miss Sharpe ever been told by us to set up a camera and continuously film her neighbour's private property. 'In fact she was given warnings by the police to remove it. 'With regards to making false and malicious allegations, not only can it cause a lot of distress, it is a criminal offence and we will pursue it.'","Claire Sharpe rowed with next door neighbour Lisa Trumble over parking .

Set for jail: Police officer Jeffrey Davies, 42, looked pale and a little shaken as the verdict was given . A plain-clothes police officer was today given a fortnight’s ‘mercy’ before being jailed for sexually assaulting two female crime victims - one of whom he asked to perform a sex act on him. South Wales Police detective Jeffrey Davies, 42, was found guilty at Swansea Crown Court of two separate sex assaults on women who came to him to report crimes. He was unanimously found guilty of one of the counts and guilty by a majority of 10 to two on the second. But he was cleared of a third of exposing himself to another female crime victim. Both assaults happened in 2010. On each occasion the vulnerable women were crime victims meeting the police officer only due to the process of reporting crimes they had suffered. Davies, a CID officer at Merthyr Tydfil police station, forced one woman’s hand on to his erect genitals through his trousers as she left a police interview room after giving a statement. She spoke of her shock at what he had done and the fact that it lasted for up to three minutes. In the second assault, Davies picked up another female crime victim one evening in the South Wales valley community where she was living. He drove her to a lane close to her home, touched her leg and repeatedly suggested she carry out a sex act upon him. The two sexual assaults were carried out . in 2010. The exposure count of which he was cleared was alleged to have . happened in 2011. Sexual assault: Davies, a CID officer at Merthyr Tydfil police station (pictured), forced one woman's hand on to his erect genitals through his trousers as she left a police interview room after giving a statement . Judge Paul Thomas QC adjourned sentencing until August 15 despite hearing that reports were unnecessary and Davies was resigned to a jail term. The judge said he wanted time to reflect before passing sentence and told Davies that, due to the ‘substantial breach of trust involved, there can only be one outcome possible’. But he released him on unconditional bail, saying: ‘I am prepared to show mercy so that you can put your affairs in order.’ He added: ‘But you must be prepared to lose your liberty when you return.’ Davies looked pale and a little shaken as the jury’s verdict was given. Neither of his female victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was present to witness the outcome of the trial. Trial: Davies, 42, was found guilty at Swansea Crown Court (pictured) of two separate sex assaults on women . South Wales Police Assistant Chief Constable Richard Lewis, speaking after the verdicts, described Davies’s actions as ‘a gross abuse’. 'His actions are completely unacceptable and abhorrent. His colleagues, who work so hard to keep their communities safe, will feel betrayed and let down' South Wales Police Assistant Chief Constable Richard Lewis . ‘Jeffrey Davies was in a position of great trust within the community he served, but he betrayed that trust with this criminal behaviour,’ he said. ‘A thorough and determined investigation by South Wales Police anti-corruption investigators revealed that Jeffery Davies had committed serious sexual offences against women victims of crime, at a time when they were vulnerable and facing personal trauma. ‘His actions are completely unacceptable and abhorrent. His colleagues, who work so hard to keep their communities safe, will feel betrayed and let down. ‘The actions of this officer were a gross abuse of position and power and will not be tolerated within policing.

Sir Bernard, who was Margaret Thatcher's press secretary, said: 'It seems they want us all to live in their yurts, tepees and wigwams in a sort of glorious save-the-planet pre-industrial squalor, regardless of our manifest objections. 'If that is not totalitarianism, I don't know what is.' Sir Bernard said: 'The problem with anti-fracking fanatics is that like other zealots they are blinkered totalitarians,' adding the activists are 'guilty of hypocrisy, utter stupidity and exaggeration'. 'Their entire approach to energy is to plump for everything that does not work and exclude anything that does - coal, gas, oil and especially nuclear energy which emits next to no CO2. 'Worse still, their long campaign has captured our limited politicians.' In his article in the Yorkshire Post, he added: 'The result is that short of an early shale gas bonanza we can no longer rely on any government of whatever political complexion to provide secure supplies of energy at affordable cost.' There were fewer than 100 protesters left last night at a potential fracking site as they finally admitted defeat to the police. More than 1,200 activists had brought exploratory shale gas drilling to a halt on the edge of the village of Balcombe, West Sussex, at the weekend. But after officers from more than 10 police forces pushed back campaigners from the site’s entrance allowing lorries to enter on Monday, they left in their droves. Anti-fracking protesters have left the Balcombe site on the final day of the Reclaim the Power Action camp . A protestor leaves the camp after being evicted from the site in Balcombe after days of demonstrations against Cuadrilla's exploratory drilling . Police walk in an arrow formation in front of lorry entering the exploratory drill site in Balcombe . Before leaving the site activists staged a protest and tried to block the road as a lorry arrived at the Cuadrilla site . A ‘Reclaim the Power’ camp that had been illegally set up in a farmer’s field two miles away was completely dismantled yesterday afternoon. Despite tents being camped out on the grass verges, traffic was not stopped and the country road was kept open by the police. Some people who had set up camping areas on footpaths around the drill were evicted by police officers without a fuss. Their only resistance was walking slowly in front of a lorry while chanting. One of the few remaining protesters is Natalie Hynde, daughter of Pretenders singer Chrissie and the Kinks frontman Ray Davies, who has returned after being arrested at the site for a public disorder offence last week.

Hundreds of protesters (pictured on Monday) joined local Balcombe residents in demonstrating against the exploratory drilling in the quiet West Sussex village . Dozens of people have been arrested since last week, including Brighton Pavilion MP Caroline Lucas (centre) As a result, the company decided last . week to temporarily ‘scale down’ work to see how much potential energy . was buried deep under the ground. This led to accusations the police had given into mob rule and were not enforcing the rule of law. Cuadrilla hopes to carry out exploratory drilling to assess if it is worth applying for a licence to extract shale gas that might involve fracking. The overall police operation against the protesters is expected to cost taxpayers more than £2million as it goes into its third week. Prime Minister David Cameron has said the whole country should accept fracking as it might potentially cut rising energy bills.","Fewer than 100 protesters left potential fracking site in West Sussex .

Matthew Matagrano: The 36-year-old has a lengthy rap sheet that includes a conviction for sodomy. He was jailed today for ten years . A convicted sex offender who repeatedly used phony correction department credentials to gain entry into New York City jails has been sentenced to ten years in prison. Matthew Matagrano was sentenced on Thursday. The 36-year-old Yonkers resident pleaded guilty last month to posing as a correction officer and sneaking into the Manhattan Detention Center, where he mingled with inmates for hours. During a February 27 visit, Matagrano assaulted and strip-searched an inmate and stole a $2,500 walkie-talkie from Riker's Island. He also handed out cigarettes to inmates. Matagrano's rap sheet includes a conviction for sodomy and sexual abuse. Matagrano said he repeatedly sneaked into jails because the people inside were 'nice' and made him 'feel important', according to a court report. During the February visit, Matagrano impersonated a staff member by flashing a fake gold badge. He then pinned an inmate up against a wall, grabbed his testicles and then ordered him into a cell where he made him remove all his clothes. Matagrano was already facing impersonation charges after blagging his way into the detention center where he spent seven-and-a-half hours with prisoners. After he was exposed, Matagrano admitted his brazen sneaking, but revealed his unusual admiration for correction workers. 'They give me food. They made me feel important,' said 5ft 8in, 340lb Matagrano. Security breach: Most people who've done time on Rikers Island can't wait to get away. Officials say that for at least a week, Matthew Matagrano used a badge and ID card to get into Rikers and roam the jail in February . Norman Seabrook, Correction union president, told the Daily News at the time: 'We’re talking about a serious breach of security.' His break into jail was not the first time Matagrano has been caught impersonating staff with fake credentials. In . 2004 he flashed a Board of Education ID to sneak into an elementary . school and look through student files. On that occasion he went to jail . for three years. His . criminal history also includes another year behind bars for sodomizing a . 15-year-old boy which lead to him registering as a sex offender for life.

A police force will allow people with just four weeks training to interview criminal suspects alone in a bid to cut costs. Sussex Police has revealed plans to recruit 32 Response Investigators on a starting salary of £20,020 a year to help free up police officers to be out on the street. A job description says they will be expected to manage their own caseload which will involve investigating crimes, gathering evidence, appearing in court and dealing with victims. Controversial: Sussex Police will employ people with four weeks of training to investigate crimes to cut costs . But despite the onerous nature of the role, applicants do not need to have any policing qualifications or experience whatsoever. The advert states: 'Having experience of criminal justice . procedures and investigations is helpful but not essential. We're . looking for the right person with the right attitude for this role, we . can teach you the rest through our bespoke 4 week training programme . upon joining.' Questions: Keith Vaz MP suggested some tasks should only be performed by experienced police officers . Sussex Police said Response Investigation Teams (RITs) will be 'removed from front line policing' but allow officers to get back out onto the streets more quickly. But critics say the new recruits, who will employed on a fixed 18-month contract, will amount to 'plastic police' who should not be carrying out the work of more experienced officers. Keith Vaz, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, told The Times that certain tasks should never be done by non-police officers. 'I think that interviewing suspects is along those lines,' he told the newspaper. 'A decent lawyer will make mincemeat out of an interview done by someone without the background and knowledge of a police officer.' Paul Sellings, chair of Sussex Police Federation, echoed his concerns and described the RITs as 'policing on the cheap'. 'Sussex Police has got cash for 18 months but when you employ police officers you employ them for 30-odd years. The force cannot afford to do this. It is policing on the cheap but it has got to be – because they only have the budget for 18 months,' he told The Argus. But Katy Bourne, Sussex Police & Crime Commissioner, insisted the recruitment is justified. 'This will allow for more officers to be out in the community; one of the things that local people have told me matters most to them,' she said. Assistant Chief Constable Robin Merrett added: 'We are able to recruit and train these staff quicker than would be the case with officers and they will provide resilience within the RITs - but they are not a replacement for officers.'","Sussex Police to recruit 32 Response Investigators on fixed contracts .

Disgraced Cardinal Keith O'Brien refused to allow his archdiocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh to participate . Shamed Cardinal Keith O’Brien personally blocked an inquiry into sex abuse in the Catholic Church in Scotland less than a year ago. The probe had been agreed by the most senior members of the Church hierarchy. It would have examined all abuse cases on file on behalf of the Bishops’ Conference of Scotland. The hierarchy planned to publish the results of the investigation, but the then president of the Bishops’ Conference, Cardinal O’Brien, who resigned earlier this year after admitting sexual misconduct, objected. He refused to allow his archdiocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh to participate, forcing the project to be scrapped. The disclosure has been confirmed by the recently retired Archbishop of Glasgow, Mario Conti. He said: ‘It was the intention of all but one member of the Bishops’ Conference to commission an independent examination of the historical cases we had on file in all of our respective dioceses and publish the result. ‘This was delayed by the objection of the then president of the conference. Without full participation of all the dioceses, the exercise would have been faulty.’ But now the inquiry is expected to be reopened, according to Archbishop Emeritus Conti. In a letter to Catholic newspaper The Tablet, which has been critical of the way the Church in Scotland has dealt with caring for the victims of sexual abuse, he said: ‘I understand that, in the light of the criticisms the Church has been facing, these audits will now be published. ‘I think they will go some way towards confirming that the percentage of priests involved in abuse is tiny, and demonstrating the seriousness and competence with which the Church in Scotland has been dealing with safeguarding in all its implications for many years.’ The letter is an unprecedented break with tradition, which dictates that discussions at the Bishops’ Conference remain confidential. A source said: ‘This clearly shows the full extent of the malignant influence that Cardinal O’Brien had on the Church up until a few months before he was exposed. Archbishop Mario Conti revealed it was O'Brien who blocked the probe . ‘What we are now seeing is a remarkable and candid revelation about the inner workings of the hierarchy which are normally never revealed. ‘There are those who have defended the Cardinal over what they try to characterise as drunken fumblings dating back decades. ‘That is very remote from the truth. By his own admissions, his misconduct continued while he held the highest office.’ Another source said: ‘Given what we now know, some people are likely to speculate about why he blocked the investigation. Who knows what his successor might find? ‘He has done enormous damage to the Church. Those left behind are still continuing to deal with the fall-out. ‘There was a will and a willingness among the bishops to dig into the past and be as transparent as possible, but that was stopped by the Cardinal. Now the way is open to make progress and continue the independent analysis originally planned.’ Earlier this week, Cardinal O’Brien received a major snub when his successor at St Andrews and Edinburgh, Monsignor Leo Cushley, disclosed that he would not be among the three bishops who will act as consecrators at his installation next month. It is customary for the outgoing archbishop to be chosen. A source said: ‘This shows the depth of feeling against the Cardinal.’ The Catholic Church of Scotland office has been contacted by the Mail Online.","Sex abuse probe had been agreed by most senior members of Church .

Pressure on the Red Arrows to perform as many displays as possible could have been a factor in the death of a pilot, a hearing has heard. Flight Lieutenant Sean Cunningham, 35, died in November 2011 after his ejection . seat went off while he was on the ground at RAF . Scampton in Lincolnshire. He was thrown into the air and his parachute failed to work. Central Lincolnshire coroner Stuart . Fisher told the pre-inquest hearing he will require witnesses to . give evidence as to whether the pressure on the team affected their . performance. Tragic: Red Arrow pilot Flt Lt Sean Cunningham died in November 2011 after his ejection seat went off while he was on the ground at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire . 'There have been suggestions that the number of displays . the team are required to perform has got to the point where it has put . pressure on the team,' he said. 'As a consequence there has been a reduction in the amount of time they display.' The hearing was told that in recent years the number of hours the Red Arrows are required to fly has been reduced by over ten per cent. Mr Fisher said that witness evidence . from Air Vice Marshall Mark Green, of the RAF’s 22 Training Group, . showed the annual number of flying hours for the team had been reduced . from 3,000 to 2,600. Flight Lieutenant Sean Cunningham's parents Jim and Monika Cunningham and his sister Nicky (right) watch the fly-past was conducted by two RAF Tornado GR4 jets after his funeral at Coventry Cathedral . Issues with the ejection seat firing handle and the working of the . parachute are also to be examined when the full inquest is held in the . New Year. Flt Lt Cunningham, who was from Coventry, completed his first season with the Arrows in 2011 and held the position of Red 5 in the formation team at the time of his death. He was the second member of the team to die tragically within three months following the loss of Flt Lt Jon Egging whose Hawk jet crashed during a display at an airshow in Dorset. Examination: An inquest into the death of Flight Lieutenant Sean Cunningham will hear as to whether the pressure on the team affected their performance . Tom Kark QC, representing Flt Lt Cunningham’s family, said today 'The family would like the widest examination possible as to why their son and brother died. 'That includes why the seat firing handle was in the position that it could so easily activate the ejection system as it appears to have done.' 'The hearing needs to examine whether other engineers and pilots had been in a similar dangerous position to the one Mr Cunningham found himself and to ensure that cannot happen again. 'There are various issues  including whether there are systematic problems leading to the position of the handle being as it was.' The inquest will also hear from Flt Lt Kirsty Stewart, the first woman pilot to fly with the Arrows. The coroner said 'She had an incident where she was training at RAF Valley. She was sitting in the back seat of a Hawk aircraft and inadvertently one of her straps went through the ejection handle. When she got out she found the handle was in position and at risk of going off.' Mr Fisher will also look at whether the ejection seat manufacturer Martin Baker Ltd communicated fully with the Ministry of Defence in relation to any problems with the equipment. The pre-inquest hearing was told that parachute which should have saved his life in the event of the ejection seat firing apparently did not work because of a shackle nut being over-tightened. A total of 40 witnesses are due to give evidence at the inquest due to start in January. Coroner Fisher said 'This is going to be a very thorough inquiry. I am going to leave no stone unturned.' Sombre: The funeral for Flt Lt Sean Cunningham was held at Coventry Cathedral . Demanding: The hearing was told that in recent years the number of hours the Red Arrows are required to fly has been reduced by over ten per cent. This is a file picture of a Red Arrows show . The Crown Prosecution Service decided not to bring criminal charges into the death following an investigation by Lincolnshire Police. But there is still the possibility of the Health and Safety Executive taking action if a breach of health and safety regulations is identified.

Blonde Sharon Cotter, 45, will pay taxpayers back the fiddled cash at £180 a month to clear it by the time she is 85. A court heard Cotter was a single mother on benefits when she met Nigel Wade, 48, and moved him into her home. Sharon Cotter, 44, a benefits cheat who hid her secret lover from the authorities so she could claim an extra £87,000, was ordered at Cardiff Crown Court to repay the full amount . She had two children with him, now aged four and five, but kept the fact he lived with her a secret from benefits officials. Cotter claimed an extra £87,000 in housing benefits and child tax credits by pretending to live as a single parent. She kept the fact that Wade moved in a secret because it would have caused her benefits to decrease. But Cotter was caught after four years of fraud after the authorities were tipped off about the couple living together in the family home in Dinas Powys, Vale of Glamorgan. The court heard how Cotter was a single parent when Nigel Wade moved in. They then had two children together but she kept their relationship secret from authorities . Judge Patrick Curran QC told Cotter: . 'As a single mother responsible for three children you were entitled to . housing benefit and child tax credits. 'But you entered into a relationship with Nigel Wade. 'He moved into your home in May 2008 and from there on in you failed to notify the authorities of the change in your circumstances. Cotter was given a 10-month jail sentence suspended for two years and given a 12-month supervision order . 'The fraud carried on for a significant period.' Adam Sharp, defending, said Cotter and her children had severe medical problems and any prison sentence would have a 'devastating effect' on her children. Mr Sharp told the court Cotter was paying back the £87,000 at a rate of £180 per month from her benefits payments. At that rate she will only just have paid taxpayers back by the time she is 85. Cotter was given a 10 month jail sentence, suspended for two years, and was handed a 12 month supervision order. Judge Curran said: 'With all the medical problems you and your children have it serves no public interest to see you jailed. 'It is in the public interest that you maintain your liberty and that your children are not deprived of their home, their mother and their carer.'","Sharon Cotter, 45, claimed she was a single parent for four years .

Graham Nield, 55, said he had attempted to ask Amanda Vickers, 48, to marry him many times but kept losing his nerve. But when he found out that he had matched all six Lotto numbers, Mr Nield, from Batley, West Yorkshire, finally decided the moment was right. Scroll down for video . Popping the question: Graham Nield finally successfully proposed to Amanda Vickers when the couple scooped the Lottery jackpot of £6.6million . 'We recently went to Tenerife and I was planning to ask Amanda to marry me,' he said. 'But every morning at breakfast I got really nervous and the words just wouldn’t come out of my mouth. 'When we found out on Sunday that we’d won, I blurted out ""Now will you marry me?"" to which she replied ""Yes, but it isn’t because you’ve won the money, it’s because I love you"".' The couple, who are both divorced, have been together for 10 years and have five grown-up children between them from previous relationships, and 13 grandchildren. They said they only told their family about their windfall last night when Mr Nield formally asked Ms Vickers’ mother Joan, 72, for permission to marry her daughter. Lost his nerve: Mr Nield said he had tried to propose on previous occasions but kept losing his nerve . Ms Vickers said her mother had no hesitation after he went down on bended knee in front of her and her father James, also 72. 'I think she loves him more than I do,' she joked. Mr Nield admitted he had considered asking his partner to marry him several times over the years but 'it just wouldn’t come out'. Ms Vickers said: 'I’ve been hoping for 10 years.' Asked about the proposal, Ms Vickers said: 'That meant more to me than the money. 'Winning the money? I’m more excited about getting married.' The couple said they are still planning the simple register office ceremony they have always imagined followed by a big party for friends and family. Mr Nield said: 'I’ll be able to afford Christmas this year for them.' They have no plans for expensive engagement and wedding rings. Ms Vickers said they were planning to use a ring they already had which has sentimental value to both of them. Icing on the cake: Ms Vickers said she's more excited about getting married than winning the money . The couple met at automotive firm Autoneum, where Mr Nield has worked for 25 years and Ms Vickers for 12. She said she is planning to hand her notice in tomorrow - and Mr Nield is her boss who will have to accept it. He said he is still thinking about whether to give up work. Remembering the moment they found out about the win, Mr Nield said: 'She just went ""whoopee"" and went jumping around the room. 'I said ""are you serious?"" and she said ""yes, we’ve won, we’ve won"". 'As she was jumping round the room going ""whoopee, whoopee"", I said ""now can we get married please?"".' The couple did not check their ticket until Sunday evening because they were up at 2am that day securing a pitch at a local car boot sale. They said they have just moved in with Ms Vickers’ parents and have a lot of things to get rid of. They are still planning a further sale, but not this weekend. They are proposing to use their money sensibly and have no major plans beyond the wedding. Mr Nield said: 'Obviously we’re going to look after the family. 'The rest of it - it doesn’t feel real at the moment.' Asked if Mr Nield was a romantic man, Ms Vickers said with a smile: 'When we’re on our own, but in front of people he puts a hard face on.' Mr Nield bought his ticket from Tesco in Batley. His winning numbers were 15, 25, 26, 33, 34, 41.","Graham Nield had tried several times to propose but always lost his nerve .

Furious: Businesswoman Jean Rasbridge has criticised 'useless' JobCentre staff who directed 100 applicants to her - but none was interested in a job . A businesswoman has criticised ‘useless’ JobCentre staff who directed 100 applicants to her – but none was interested in a job. Jean Rasbridge said the service was ‘wasting everyone’s time’ after candidates either failed to show up for interviews or even start a job once they were hired. She claims the Government-run centres were simply helping the unemployed to ‘tick boxes’ so they could keep their benefits. Mrs Rasbridge, who co-founded a firm that sells electronic cigarettes, was initially pleased to receive almost 100 applications for an £8-per-hour post as a warehouse packer. But of the seven jobseekers Mrs Rasbridge invited for an interview, only two showed up. And even the one candidate who was offered the position failed to turn up. Last night she said her firm had stopped using the JobCentre to find staff after their ‘nightmare’ experience. ‘I found the JobCentre completely useless and other people in our industry say the same thing,’ she said. ‘The applicants who applied were obviously just ticking boxes to keep their benefits. ‘It was a complete waste of time for them, the JobCentre and for us. ‘They weren’t interested in working for us, even when we showed an interest in employing them.’ Problems began in August last year when the firm, ecigarettedirect.co.uk, placed an advert with a JobCentre in Gorseinon, Swansea. After sifting through the candidates – some of whom came from as far as Glasgow and Peterborough – Mrs Rasbridge realised few had any intention of working. ‘By the end of the second day we had getting on for 100 applications from all walks of life – people with PhDs, teachers, lecturers, some of them from quite a distance away,’ she added. ‘We had one from Glasgow, another from Peterborough, but then it suddenly clicked with me that they were just filling in the forms to retain their benefits.’ Unhappy: Mrs Rasbridge said her firm had stopped using the JobCentre to find staff after their 'nightmare' experience. This is a file picture of a job centre . Under rules introduced last October, jobseekers can lose their benefits for up to three years if they repeatedly refuse to actively seek or be available for work. Mr Rasbridge said the Government should make it less attractive for jobseekers to claim handouts. ‘When they’ve got to get up at 8am, catch a bus to work and stay until 5pm, there is not much incentive to do so when they are managing well on various benefits,’ she said. ‘It’s too much like hard work. ‘They would be better off saying: “Look, I don’t want to work, just give me the money”, it would stop everyone wasting their time. ‘When we advertise privately we aren’t inundated with applicants, but they are of a much better quality – they actually turn up for an interview.’ A JobCentre spokesman said advisers work hard to help people off benefits and into a job. ‘It is only right that jobseekers should do everything they can to find work if they want to claim Jobseekers’ Allowance and our advisers will work with them to ensure they apply for jobs which suit their skills and experience,’ he said.","Jean Rasbridge said the service was .

The Great British Bake Off has turned into such a sure-fire ratings success that the BBC’s top executives, it appears, have decided they all want a slice of the cake. The controller of BBC2 has hinted that the show could be poached by the corporation’s main channel next year after rival executives started ‘sniffing’ around in the wake of its recent popularity. Janice Hadlow – who earns £235,000 as the head of BBC2 – revealed that the new controller of BBC1 Charlotte Moore may soon take Bake Off away from her channel. Sweet success: The fourth series of the baking show kicked off to record viewing figures . Miss Moore was the first to commission Bake Off in 2010, and it is thought that she now wants to regain control of the show. On Tuesday, the first episode of the latest series attracted 5.6million viewers – a record for a series opener. Hungry: Janice Hadlow, controller of BBC Four, is said to have her eyes on the next series of Bake Off . Asked whether the programme would be moving to BBC1 next year, Miss Hadlow told an audience at the Edinburgh Television Festival: ‘You know, 5.6million provokes some sniffing. ‘At the moment we’re just very happy to have it and it feels as though it’s a lovely show for us. ‘We’ll see what happens. I think it’s a bit like a flag going up isn’t it? If you have a programme that ends with 7million [viewers] it’s not going to be unnoticed is it? ‘I think it’s something that if you’re running a channel like BBC2 you have to take into your stride.’ She added: ‘We’ve nurtured this programme, we love it but who knows? It’s happened to other programmes, we’ve seen other programmes move and you can’t legislate against it.’ Miss Hadlow denied that there was a ‘turf war’ at the corporation but appeared to concede that she would be powerless to stop the show moving over to BBC1. ‘I would have to be collegiate and think of the BBC as a whole,’ she said. And she also took the opportunity to address the recent marital woes of presenter Paul Hollywood. The 47-year-old baker split from his wife Alexandra in May following speculation that he had started an affair with his American Bake Off co-star, Mexican chef Marcela Valladolid. Miss Hadlow explained that any presenters working for the BBC needed to be able to ‘manage’ their private lives, adding: ‘He knows himself, he has been open about it. ‘If you are in the public eye your actions will get attention and it’s just about being aware of that. I think our presenters know that they are always presenters. Even in their private life they will be seen as the BBC presenter. ‘In the end what goes on in their private life is not necessarily something we can manage and they have to manage it themselves.’ Differing tastes: Viewers took to Twitter to express their love for Mary Berry... but a cooler regard for Paul Hollywood . The BBC have repeatedly denied that . the judge’s personal woes would affect the programme. But the Daily Mail . revealed fans were so furious about the rumoured affair that many . threatened to stop watching the show altogether. Producer . Richard McKerrow admitted bosses had been concerned that Hollywood’s . behaviour would spark a viewer backlash, telling audiences at the same . festival: ‘I worried about it, of course I did…we had people saying I’m . not going to watch Bake Off.’ Mr McKerrow said he felt people decided not to boycott the show because they had forgiven Hollywood. But viewers have been lukewarm in their response to his appearance. Writing on Twitter, one said: ‘I’ve lost pretty much all respect for Paul Hollywood but at least we have Mary Berry, she’s a saint.’","BBC2 controller Janice Hadlow says BBC1's Charlotte Moore wants the show .

A couple abandoned their holiday in the south of France to return home after they found out their pet lizard had gone missing. Colette Pawan, 34, and husband Bob, 35, had just driven more than 1,000 miles from Swansea to Nice, when police alerted them to the disappearance. They had left their beloved Archie - a 5-foot long tegu lizard - with a neighbour, but only days into their holiday he had made his escape from their garden. Concern: Colette Pawan loves her pet lizard Archie so much she drove back to Wales from Nice, France, when she heard he went missing . Police told the concerned couple that the black-and-white beast was now at the centre of a police search. The pair had only just arrived near Nice when they got the call about their missing pet - and jumped back in the car for the 12 hours drive home. And the couple were delighted today after Archie was back safe at their home in Swansea, South Wales. Teacher Colette said: 'It was awful. We were very worried about Archie - he is like a member of the family. 'We had only been in France a day or two but we couldn't stay there - we drove straight back. 'By the time we reached to Dover his picture was in the papers and on the news after it was issued by police.' Part of the family: Mr and Mrs Pawan have owned Archie for six years and made built a purpose built extension for the reptile . South Wales Police issued a missing pet alert on Sunday after Archie - a tegu normally only found in South America - made a dash for freedom. The neighbour looking after him left a door ajar while cooking him his favourite treat of boiled eggs. He was eventually found the next days safe and well, walking down a nearby street, and returned to his home - in the back of a police van. Police had issued a photograph of the . gigantic black-and-white lizard after it vanished to warn people to . watch out although it is not dangerous. Mr and Mrs Pawan have had Archie for . six years. He has his own purpose-built extension at the couple's house, . and is a regular sight being walked around the streets on a lead. He loves warming himself under his special heat lamps or sunbathing in the garden. Archie also likes sitting on Mrs Pawan's lap while they watch TV or going for trips to the beach. Familiar face:  The fully-grown tegu lizard is regularly seen walking the streets of Swansea on his lead. Police released pictures of the lizard and launched a hunt for it after it disappeared from King Edward Rd, right . Mr Pawan said: 'Our neighbour was looking after him and popped in to make him some boiled eggs. 'The door must have a bit ajar and he saw it and went for it. 'It was a sunny day and when he gets warm after sunbathing he gets a bit frisky. He's very intelligent and loves attention - he likes human company.' Mr Pawan added: 'The police were absolutely brilliant - the officers said it wasn't the kind of thing they do every day.' Tegu lizards are large, striped reptiles reaching four-to-five feet in length and weighing around 15 pounds. They are typically found in the wild in South America, although some species (Gold Tegu) can also be found in Panama. They look similar to monitor lizards, found in Africa, Asia and Australia, but they are not closely related. Monitor lizards, pictured in Africa, have smaller heads, longer necks, lighter bodies and a different pattern of scales, than tegus . Tegus have larger heads, shorter necks, heavier bodies and a different pattern of scales, than their similar counterparts. In the wild they live in a variety of habitats from swamps to rainforests and savannahs. Argentine Black and White Tegu, Red Tegu and Gold Tegu are all common in the pet trade. Pets that have been released into the wild illegally have adapted to their environments. Remote areas of South Florida, US, have known populations of tegu, which would have been established from unwanted or escaped pets. The reptiles are omnivorous, using their forked tongues to forage for fruit, seeds, eggs and small vertebrates. South American communities consider them pests since they are renowned for raiding chicken coops and eating the eggs. They also enjoy a meal of crocodile eggs and in Florida they feed on the eggs of American alligators.","Archie the 5-foot long tegu lizard escaped from a neighbour's garden while owners Colette and Bob Pawan were abroad .

'Ghoulish': Gareth Kemp lived with the body of a dead pensioner for weeks so he could continue to steal from him . A thief who lived with the body of a pensioner on his sofa for three weeks so he could continue to steal his life savings has been jailed. Gareth Kemp, 40, had befriended Thomas Hulme, 72, who allowed him to live in his home in Bolton, Greater Manchester, despite his drug addiction. Mr Hulme also allowed Kemp to use his cash card so he could buy him shopping, Bolton Crown Court heard. But when Kemp found Mr Hulme dead on his living room couch, he chose not to tell the authorities and continued to use the card to feed his drug habit for weeks. Kemp was finally caught out when he appeared in court in connection with a separate offence and tried to throw a cash card to his girlfriend sitting in the public gallery. Suspicious court staff intervened and discovered it belonged to Mr Hulme. They reported the matter to police. Detectives discovered that over four weeks Kemp had drained almost all of Mr Hulme's life savings totalling more than £4,500. Kemp admitted theft by false representation and was jailed for 20 months. Mr Hulme's death was finally reported on April 18. Police said there were no suspicious circumstances but that he had likely been dead for around three weeks. Caught out: Kemp was caught on CCTV near to cash machines when the withdrawals were made from Mr Hulme's account . Confession: When interviewed, Kemp admitted to police that he had withdrawn all the money to buy drugs . And during the investigation, police established that Kemp had continued to live in Mr Hulme's house during this time. Trust: Mr Hulme had allowed Kemp to live at his home in Bolton, pictured, despite his drug addiction . Bank records showed that Mr Hulme's bank balance had gone from £4,440.91 on March 11 to £4.78 overdrawn on April 15. There were numerous withdrawals of £100 at various locations and the pattern of spending was vastly in excess of previous months. Officers also viewed CCTV of Kemp near to cash machines at the time withdrawals were made. On interview Kemp admitted withdrawing all the money from the account to pay for drugs. Detective Constable Andy Devine, said: . 'Draining an elderly man’s life savings after he has died is, in my . eyes, tantamount to grave robbing. 'The victim put a roof over Kemp’s head and got nothing in return other than betrayal. 'Over . just a few weeks Kemp blew a significant amount of money to feed a . habit and his ghoulish actions reflect the kind of appalling lengths . some people will go to when dependent on drugs. 'Drug addiction blights many lives and, as this case shows, can impact on the lives of the most innocent of residents. 'Hopefully a stint in prison will help cure him of this terrible affliction and help him to see the error of his ways.'","Gareth Kemp, 40, had been living with Thomas Hulme, 72, in Bolton .

The 89-year-old heir to New York socialite Brooke Astor has been given medical parole after serving just two months of a prison sentence for siphoning millions from his ailing mother's estate. Anthony Marshall was sentenced to a one- to three-year sentence in June but a medical parole decided today that he is too ill to serve his sentence for grand larceny. Marshall's doctors said he suffers from Parkinson's, uses a wheelchair and is dependent on others to help with daily tasks. Under state law, inmates with serious and permanent illnesses can be given medical parole, according to CBS News. The . New York parole board decided unanimously to free Marshall because he . was 'suffering from a significant and permanent non-terminal condition, . disease or syndrome'. He has been at an disclosed hospital for at least a month, according to the New York Post, and cannot walk or use the bathroom by himself. The . parole board also considered the $14.5 million in restitution Marshall . paid for stealing from his elderly mother to fund a Maine estate and . 55ft yacht among other luxuries. Marshall, . who was given his discharge papers at 4.30pm today, will remain under . the supervision of a New York parole officer until June 20, 2016, which . is the latest possible date of his sentence. The . 89-year-old had been found guilty of stealing millions from his . family's estate after his mother had Alzheimer's diagnosed in the years . leading up to her death. Court date: Anthony Marshall arrived in court in June, helped by Charlene, as a Judge prepared to sentence him to prison . Emotional: Anthony Marshall's wife Charlene, cried and hugged him, as the heir to Brooke Astor's estate was jailed in June . When his lawyers first filed for medical parole last month, a source told the New York Post: . 'Anthony is dying, and he is in a lousy state prison. He has a new . doctor's letter stating he is even worse than a few months ago. 'He has very bad heart concerns. He is incontinent. It could be weeks or months or days.' When sentenced in June, Manhattan's Supreme Court Justice A Kirke Bartley said: 'I take no pleasure in following my duties', as he ordered Marshall to serve the minimum sentenced handed down to him in 2009. Mr Bartely said he would rather not jail the Second World War veteran, but prosecutors argued that his state of health and war record should not mean an early release. Marshall's lawyer, William B. Zabel, said his client should be allowed to die in peace at his home with his wife Charlene by his side. When Marshall was wheeled out of court to begin his prison term in June, his wife wept and hugged him. He had previously lost a series of requests to avoid prison because of his failing health. Distraught: Charlene Marshall seen leaving court in June after her 89-year-old husband was ordered to serve his sentence . Astor had been a fixture of New York society before her death at the age of 105, in 2007. Her charitable largesse was recognized in 1998 with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's top civilian honor. Astor . inherited the money from her third husband, Vincent Astor, a . great-great-grandson of real estate and fur magnate John Jacob Astor, . who was one of the first multimillionaires in the U.S. When Marshall arrived in the courtroom in a wheelchair, his wife Charlene cried and caressed his shoulder. In . earlier trials his wife, who one of Marshall's sons blames for the . family's troubles, had been accused by prosecutors as being the motive . for Marshall taking money from his mother. Elizabeth Loewy, a prosecutor, said Marshall defrauded his mother 'because of his 'preoccupation for getting money for Charlene', according to the New York Times. The . original trial was also told that Astor disliked her daughter-in-law . and one of her nurses referred to Mrs Marshall as 'Miss Piggy'. Her dislike for Mrs Marshall was allegedly shown in her will, when she left her two second-hand mink coats in a size 6, knowing she would never be able to wear them. Sentencing: Anthony Marshall seen in court with his lawyers on sentencing day . At Marshall's sentencing, the judge . read parts of a letter from one of his twin sons, Alec, urging the court . to spare him prison. 'Please . consider all the good that my father has done for this country ... My . father once said, about the events that happened before the case, that, 'you . can't change the past', Justice Bartley quoted the letter as saying. He . urged Marshall to allow his son to get back in contact with him. Marshall's twin sons from an earlier marriage, Alec and Phillip, had testified against their father in the 2009 trial. And . it was Philip who brought the original guardianship case against his . father in 2006, charging him of misusing Astor's funds, according to Vanity Fair. The civil case was settled but a criminal case quickly followed. Prosecutors said Marshall, a former U.S. ambassador, exploited his mother's failing mind to loot her millions. After her Alzheimer's diagnosis, he bought himself lavish gifts, including a $920,000 yacht, with her money. High society, Anthony Marshall with his mother, Brooke Astor, at the Plaza Hotel in 2002 . He also took valuable artwork off her . walls and engineered changes to her will that gave him control of most . of her estate, including millions previously earmarked for her favorite . charities, the Manhattan district attorney's office said. Astor had devoted her life to . philanthropy, giving eye-watering sums of money to the St Regis Hotel, . the New York Public Library and the Metropolitan Art Museum. However, . the multimillionaire was left to spend her last days in allegedly . heart-breaking conditions - her dogs messing over her Park Avenue . apartment while she napped in her own urine with no one to help. She died in her 64-acre Holly Hill . estate in New York, in August 2007. The estate, and her Park Avenue home . in Manhattan, were later sold. When the wranglings over her $100 million estate were settled in March last year, it was reported that Marshall was ordered to pick $74,680 worth of her possessions.

Antonio Horta-Osorio, group chief executive, said the bank is working to 'ensure our customers' complaints are addressed efficiently and fairly'. However, Which? raised concerns over a 'noticeable drop' in uphold rates of PPI-related complaints made to Lloyds Banking Group by consumers. Less than half (43 per cent) of these types of complaint were upheld across the group in the second half of 2012, compared with 87 per cent in the same period a year earlier. The Financial Ombudsman Service, which resolves disputes when customers are unable to come to an agreement with their bank, upheld 86 per cent of PPI-related complaints made about Lloyds TSB in the second half of last year. Which? claimed a 'staggering' £18.4 billion has now been set aside across the industry to tackle the ongoing surge in PPI complaints, eclipsing the £8.9 billion cost of the Olympics . Which? executive director Richard Lloyd . said: 'It is staggering that the cost of the PPI mis-selling scandal now . stands at more than double the cost of the Olympic Games. 'We have repeatedly raised concerns with . the banks, regulators and Financial Ombudsman Service about the . worrying variation in quality of PPI complaint handling.' PPI is the insurance sold alongside credit cards, loans and other finance agreements to insure payments are made if the borrower is unable to make them due to sickness or unemployment. But high numbers of policyholders found that the insurance was useless to them because they are illegible to claim, for example if they are self-employed or over 65 years of age. Critics claimed the banking industry began aggressively selling PPI to customers after realising that the policies were highly profitable. The Financial Services Authority said sorting out PPI was one of its priorities in 2005 when it took over the task of regulating the general insurance industry. The FSA began imposing fines for PPI mis-selling in 2006 before banning one of the worst types of PPI in 2009 – 'single premium' – which was sold to mortgage-buyers and added to their total loan at the start. The Office for Fair Trading became involved in 2007 and referred PPI to the Competition Commission. The PPI scandal escalated in 2008, after Which? reported that one in three PPI customers had been sold 'worthless' insurance. Thousands of consumers then tried to claim compensation for being mis-sold the insurance but the majority were protected. The FSA then brought in stricter rules for PPI sales. The banking industry tried to argue these standards couldn't be imposed retrospectively but lost its High Court battle. Banks have now set aside millions to cover compensation for PPI mis-selling claims. Lloyds customers who have seen their . PPI claims rejected were recently urged by consumer campaigners to fight . on for compensation after an undercover investigation into the bank by . The Times found evidence of failures in processing complaints. Lloyds said at the time that it had taken immediate action and it believed the comments noted by the newspaper to be isolated. Lloyds said today that PPI complaints now account for a smaller proportion of complaints received by the group. Some 81 per cent of complaints it receives are about PPI, edging down from 86 per cent in the second half of last year. It said in a statement: 'The group continues to proactively manage the issue of PPI complaints in order that customers can receive redress if they have been mis-sold. 'This is an ongoing process and we will continue to review all claims in an in-depth manner that produces fair outcomes for customers.' Last month, chief ombudsman Natalie Ceeney said signs of bad practice in PPI complaints handling procedures were adding to 'an atmosphere of universal suspicion and distrust' among consumers. She said: 'It will undoubtedly affect our ability to handle complaints as quickly and as smoothly as we would like.' PPI is the most complained-about financial product that the financial ombudsman has ever seen and it recently took on an extra 1,000 case workers to help it deal with the claims. The ombudsman deals with complaints about a range of financial products and services, but PPI is the issue where it is most likely to uphold a complaint in consumers' favour. Almost four-fifths (78 per cent) of PPI complaints made against the industry generally were upheld by the ombudsman in the first quarter of this year. Banks have blamed claims management firms acting on behalf of consumers for slowing the process down and making it harder for them to weed out genuine claims from bogus ones.","Lloyds has become the latest bank to announce it is putting more cash aside to deal with compensation claims over the PPI mis-selling scandal .

Britain sent a laser weapon to the Falklands to 'dazzle' low-flying Argentine pilots as they attacked Royal Navy ships, secret government papers revealed today. The secret device was developed quickly and secretly but was never used in action during the 1982 conflict. Its existence was revealed a year later to Margaret Thatcher in a January 1983 letter, marked 'Top Secret and UK Eyes A,' from Michael Heseltine. Attack: An Argentine jet flies in to attack British ships, but it was revealed today Britain developed a laser to dazzle them and sent it across to the Falklands . Tragedy: HMS Antelope sinking in San Carlos Water after it was hit on May 24, 1982 by an Argentinian bomb . The then newly-appointed defence secretary was briefing the Iron lady about the Soviet Union's laser weaponry, and told the Conservative leader Britain already had one. Flashback: Then defence secretary Michael Heseltine revealed the device existed in a top secret memo to Margaret Thatcher released today . Mr Heseltine wrote: 'We developed and deployed with very great urgency a naval laser weapon, designed to dazzle low flying Argentine pilots attacking ships, to the Task Force in the South Atlantic. This weapon was not used in action and knowledge of it has been kept to a very restricted level.' His briefing on military capabilities also touches on the laser weapon research and development programmes called Raker and Shingle which were 'proceeding at high priority,' according to the papers. He claims the Soviet Union could field laser weapons by the mid-1980s but it was uncertain whether owning such offensive laser weapons was useful. By the end of 1979 British interests were in using medium power laser directed against relatively softer targets such as eyes, optic and electro-optic sensors. His note said: 'the Russians could be in a position to field such weapons by the mid-1980s (in fact, the Russians may already have deployed a laser weapon on the cruiser Kirov)'. British researchers concentrated on countermeasures. Programmes that were under way included Raker, which aimed to think up every possible way of protecting sensors. There was also the development programme known as Shingle which sought to capitalise on any practical solutions arising out of the Raker work. Meanwhile new documents reveal that when Margaret Thatcher visited the Falklands to mark the 150th anniversary of the establishment of a permanent British settlement, it took six months to plan and cost  £209,867. Our hero: A rousing welcome from the Hampshire 'Tigers' for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, but her trip to the Falklands was top secret and only revealed when she arrived amid fears the enemy could attack again . Victory: Lady Thatcher and Denis met soldiers and civil leaders on a trip that cost £209,000 . The Iron Lady flew with the RAF to Ascension Island and then by Hercules to Port Stanley for the four-day trip. There was intense secrecy surrounding her visit as they feared the Argentinians might still be a threat, as it came eight months after the war ended. The press were told Lady Thatcher was off to Chequers for the weekend, but instead she and Denis went to RAf Brize Norton to start the journey. Her trip was only announced when she arrived. Duty clerk Alan Logan wrote in a top secret note the importance 'of maintaining total secrecy of the visit. 'The very fact that it was Friday night lended itself readily to the pretence that the Prime Minister and Mr Thatcher would be going to Chequers and, therefore, it would be normal for their luggage to be in the front hall, albeit slightly more than normal'. The notes also reveal more mundane details about the trip, where the Prime Minister decided not to take 'a good Stilton' for civil and military leaders on the island and that she would lay a wreath of synthetic poppies because  real ones would not survive the long trip from Britain.","Device was sent to Falklands as secret weapon to stop the enemy .

To ride as fast as he possibly can on two wheels. As a child he was inspired watching and reading about the land speed world record attempts of the 1960s. And now, in a bid to prove what can be achieved through backyard engineering, he has custom-built a bike which reached speeds of up to 80mph. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . In action: Amateur cyclist Tom Donhou has managed to reach speeds of up to 80mph on a bike he made himself . A London-based bicycle frame builder by trade, Donhou was determined to build a bike capable of top speeds using the same parts he normally sells to customers. But to hit such dizzying heights, a departure from the norm was necessary. That came in the form of a 104-tooth chainring which was purposely built for the bike. And in another tribute to British engineering, he wanted to use his old Ford Zephyr car to block the wind. With the help of a friend, he built a frame onto the back of the classic car to act as a wind tunnel. 'The idea had been in my head for a while,' said Donhou, in a documentary made by Spindle Productions about the attempt. 'It just needed a tipping point.' Innovation: Tom Donhou used his skills as a frame builder to come up with a design which could hit 80mph . Determined: Amateur cyclist Tom Donhou said he wanted to see what was possible through 'backyard engineering' The current land speed record for a bike is 167mph which was set by Fred Rompelberg using a dragster in the Salt Flats. 'We didnt have a . dragster or the Salt Flats,' said Donhou. 'But this isn't about setting records. This was about using our imagination and being resourceful. We used my old car and a bike I built to see how fast we could go.' During a first run out on the roads, Donhou achieved 60mph. But he felt the bike could definitely go further. Cycling on a flat course, a reasonably fit amateur rider should be able to reach speeds of about 20mph on a normal bike. On a racing bike they might even reach 30mph. But thanks to a combination of climate control, specially-engineered bikes and thighs the size of most people's waists, the likes of Chris Hoy reach almost 50mph. Of course, with wind assistance and a steep decline, even amateur cyclists could expect to reach around 60mph. One of the major factors to be overcome is air drag. This is why Tom Donhou built a wooden fram over the back of his Ford Zephyr so that he would face as little as possible. But over the years, cyclists have used all sorts of firepower to propel themselves to electrifying speeds. In May, a French cyclist broke the land speed record on a bicycle by attaching a hydrogen-peroxide rocket to the frame. Francois . Gissy from Alsace recorded a top speed of 163mph (263kph) on his . self-built vehicle on an old runway in Munchhouse in North Eastern . France. The 80mph top speed was set on an old World War Two runway strip, one of the few places in the UK with enough flat, straight track for Donhou to attempt it. 'It was potentially, fairly dangerous,' said Donhou. 'I was screaming go, go go. Eventually I outran the car and ran out of road.' Interested to see just how fast his bike is capable of going, Donhou tested it out on rollers back in his workshop and reached 102mph. And that has given him determination to get back out on the road and go even faster. WATCH VIDEO OF THE 80MPH RIDE .

A man who was unhappy with his dental treatment stormed into his dentist's surgery and threatened him with a 3ft scaffolding pole. Bryan Farrow, 36, accused Neil Chapple of 'messing up' his teeth during a confrontation while Mr Chapple was treating another patient. Farrow had asked the receptionist at Halstead Dental Care in Halstead, Essex, if the dentist was at work before leaving the building and returning minutes later armed with the pole. Prosecutor Sarah Vine told Chelmsford Crown Court: 'He walked into the . room where Mr Chapple was treating a patient and went up to Mr Chapple . and said: ""You messed up my teeth.

Farrow left the room and was heard saying to a receptionist: ‘Look at these smiley teeth’. He said he was going to sue Mr Chapple. Farrow then left the surgery saying ‘sorry’ and put the pole in the boot of his car. He was arrested later by police after the incident at 2.15pm on May 20. Farrow, of Stanway, Essex, has been jailed for 12 months after admitting threatening behaviour and possessing the pole. He also admitted a charge of damage for picking paint off a cell wall while he was in custody. He has also been banned from contacting Mr Chapple or attending his practice. A judge told Farrow, who refused to have legal representation in court, that the incident had been 'shocking, unpleasant and disgraceful'. Farrow asked staff at Halstead Dental Care, pictured, if Mr Chapple was in, then left the building to return moments later armed with the pole .

But research found that with the privilege of attending such an esteemed institution, students are often having to work twice as hard for a degree as their peers at other higher education establishments. A detailed survey of students from Which? and the Higher Education Policy Institute analysed the amount of time students spent on their workload, researching 13 subjects at different British universities. Undergraduates taking history and philosophy courses at Cambridge University can be expected to complete almost 45 hours a week of lectures, tutorials and private study . They discovered that undergraduates taking history and philosophy courses at Cambridge University can be expected to complete almost 45 hours a week of lectures, tutorials and private study. This is almost double the workload compared with just 20 hours student at Essex University put in and 19 hours at Northumbria, the Daily Telegraph reported. But disappointing figures reveal that despite all their hard work, a job isn't guaranteed for even the brightest graduate. A fifth of graduates are unemployed or in unsalaried or low-paid posts six months after leaving university, official figures reveal. One in ten are out of work and a similar proportion are on internships, doing voluntary work or travelling. Students are often having to work twice as hard for a degree as their peers at other higher education establishments . Those that have found employment are often stuck in menial jobs such as window cleaning, packing or bottling and stacking shelves. The research by the Higher Education Statistics Agency paints a sobering picture for young university leavers who have spent at least three years studying and have built up large debts. The news comes as a study found a 'squeezed middle' of graduates will end up paying far more for their student loans than highly paid peers or low earners, a study shows. And women face the heaviest burden because they earn less than men on average and will take longer to pay off their debt, exposing them to more interest payments. The 'inequitable' situation was discovered by an academic using the government repayment calculator. Professor Ron Johnston, of the University of Bristol, found students who finish university owing £50,000 would repay £115,807 over 19 years, based on a starting salary of £35,000. But a graduate who begins a job earning £25,000 would end up paying £159,899 over 30 years – with £26,664 waived as loans are written off after three decades. Some students would never have to pay a penny back as repayments are not triggered unless annual earnings are more than £21,000. Students from better-off families who fail to qualify for grants at university and then go on to work in modestly paid jobs would therefore be worst affected. Professor Johnston warned women would face the highest repayments, as their salaries are usually lower than those of men with the same qualifications in the same jobs.",Undergraduates taking history and philosophy courses at Cambridge University can be expected to complete almost 45 hours a week of work .

But, when that route involves travelling along the most dangerous road in the world, it makes it all the more tricky. These pictures show a group of cyclists from the UK during a ride along the notorious North Yungus Road in Bolivia. The single-lane track - which is also known as Death Road - is estimated to take the lives of around 300 travellers each year. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Risky: Cyclist Nick Smith sits on the edge of the most dangerous turn as he cycles along the most dangerous road in the world . Dangerous: The single-lane route, formally known as the North Yungus Road, is a 40-mile stretch of path in Bolivia . Nerves of steel: Enveloped in a deep mist, these cyclists hang their bikes over the edge of the roadside . With no railings, the exposed and narrow road runs alongside a 700-metre sheer drop. The trek takes around six hours to . complete, including time for a break on the most dangerous turn on the . road, which has claimed the most lives. The bravest cyclists can sit on the edge of the notorious bend and dangle their legs into the valley below. Nick Smith, 34, a graphic designer from Birmingham, travelled the length of the road during a cycling holiday. But to make sure he stood the best chance of survival he sipped a sacred drink and prayed to 'Pacha Mama', or Mother . Earth, in the hope that she would help him complete the journey safely. Mr Smith, 34, said: 'We drunk some of the Pacha Mama before splashing it on our wheels and the ground as a ritual. Lethal: It is estimated that about 300 travellers are killed each year on the road, which runs narrowly alongside a 700-metre drop . Beginning: The team of cyclists are pictured at the start of the North Yungas Road, surrounded by mist-covered mountains . Scary: These cyclists sit on the edge of the famous road, during their six hour ride . 'I was scared of heights when I went but I was soon forced to confront that. 'I had tried to prepare myself for the road but after actually being there, there's nothing quite like it. 'It was terrifying to begin with but by the end of the trip I was sitting on the edge, dangling my legs above the drop! 'The views were incredible, I have never experienced anything like it.' As . one of the few routes to connect the Amazon rainforest of northern . Bolivia to its capital city, the road ascends to more than 15,000ft . before drastically dropping to 3,900ft.

Cross markings on the road indicate . where cars have fallen, but while the road is legendary for its extreme . danger, Bolivian natives are forced to use it as a crucial . transport route. Local road rules specify that the downhill driver never has the right of way and must move to the outer edge of the road. This forces the faster downhill vehicle to stop so that passing can be negotiated safely. Unlike the rest of Bolivia, vehicles are required to drive on the left side of the road, to give the driver a better view of the vehicle's outside wheel and making passing safer. No chances: Cyclist Nick Smith drinks a good luck drink which is used to see the traveller back safely . Mr Smith added:  'The road, in most places, is just under three metres wide so it's only really big enough for one car. 'When you see two cars trying to pass it looks impossible.' Mr Smith took part in an organised cycling tour where experienced guides help to direct groups along the road, warning them of potential danger spots. During the trek, they stopped for a photo opportunity on one of the most lethal corners of the road, a section that is famous for claiming most lives. 'It was refreshing to have someone who knew the road so well,' Mr Smith said. 'We stopped every so often and were told of the terrain coming up and anything we needed to be wary of. 'The start of the ride is a 21km modernised wider section which is covered in concrete tarmac, before the track turns treacherous. 'It gives you time to get used to the drops before the main part of the Death Road.' But the group weren't without injury, as Mr Smith soon discovered. The graphic designer said: 'One girl in the group fell off her bike and cracked her head open. 'On any other route it wouldn't have seemed such a big injury but I think as it was on the Death Road it seemed much worse.' The track then winds around the mountain where it widens and becomes safer. He added: 'As the road becomes safer, you begin to enjoy the surroundings which are stunning. 'Once you get you mind past how sheer the drops are, it's fascinating. 'Starting off among the clouds and then dropping down is quite magical. 'Now I have done it and survived it, I would definitely give it another shot as it was an amazing experience.'","UK cyclists rode along Bolivia's 40-mile North Yungus Road .

Nathan Hibberd, 39, broke down into tears as he was sentenced to another lengthy sentence behind bars after already having served four long jail terms. Frustrated judge  Jamie Tabor QC told Hibberd it appeared no amount of jail time could reform him. He said: 'I can’t stop you with whatever jail sentence I impose, unless it is life, which I’m not entitled to do. 'If you are going to stop it’s got to come from you and no one else.' Career criminal Nathan Hibberd has been jailed for the fifth time after committing his 200th burglary but frustrated Judge Jamie Tabor said he didn't think the sentence would stop him from committing further crime . Gloucester Crown Court heard how Hibberd's life of crime stretching back more than 20 years has caused 'untold misery' to his victims. His first house burglary was in 1992. He was first jailed for three and a half years in 1999 for 62 burglaries, for four years in 2001 for 54 burglaries, and for four-and-a-quarter years in 2005 for 41 burglaries. He was jailed again in 2009 for four-and-a-half years after admitting 42 burglaries in Gloucester. Hibberd was caught red-handed committing his latest crimes on July 16 when he broke into a home in Kingsholm, Gloucester, and another in Wotton, Gloucester, and stole jewellery. He then went on the run and a manhunt was launched on July 19 by officers, with a reward of £1,000 offered by Crimestoppers. Shocked residents spotted him cowering in a garden in Tuffley, Gloucester, the next day. He was captured by officers after climbing on to the roof of a house nearby. Hibberd, from Matson, Gloucester, pleaded guilty to two counts of dwelling burglary. Back in court: Hibberd was jailed to three and a half years in prison for each of the two burglaries to run concurrently at Glopucester Crown Court . Judge Tabor said: 'You have been before this court on many occasions, many occasions, for burglary. 'Yet again you have caused untold misery by breaking into peoples houses. 'I don’t think the victims have exaggerated when they said they were frightened and feel absolutely outraged. 'You were caught red-handed. You have been jailed in the past and now it’s up to you. Enough is enough.' Sniffing back tears, Hibberd responded: 'I’m trying, sir.' Judge Tabor said: 'You may be, but breaking into people’s houses shows you are not trying hard enough.' He sentenced him to three and half years for both burglaries, to run concurrently, and said: 'Get off the drugs inside. 'Come out changed and I hope the probation service will help to provide you with an environment where you are not tempted to do it again.' Hibberd was also ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £150.","Nathan Hibberd was jailed for three and a half years for two burglaries .

A coroner is warning pubs about the dangers of eating competitions after a contestant choked to death on a boiled egg. Sharon Dixon, 54, was taking part in the egg eating contest to win a free drink when she collapsed at the Wellington Arms pub in Grimsby. Staff tried to perform the Heimlich manoeuvre but Ms Dixon died in hospital two days later from a lack of oxygen to her brain, an inquest into her death heard. Now, Coroner Paul Kelly says he will write to North East Lincolnshire Council to warn licensing officers about the dangers of people who have been drinking taking part in eating competitions in pubs and bars. Mr Kelly heard that Ms Dixon, of Grimsby, had eaten up to five hard-boiled eggs and had been drinking. She was believed to be one of five people who took part in the speed eating contest. Rebecca Wood, leaseholder of the Wellington Arms, told the inquest yesterday: 'It seemed a bit of fun. I never thought of any risks or that anything would happen.' Pub manager Thomas Pigott told the inquest he had organised a game of Russian roulette, where customers hit each other on the head with the eggs to see if they were raw or hard-boiled. He later laid out five bowls with five eggs each for pubgoers to race each other to eat them the quickest, the Grimsby Telegraph reported. Mr Pigott, who holds a valid first aid certificate, tried to perform the Heimlich and placed Ms Dixon, a former hairdresser and pub landlady, on her side. Staff at the Wellington Arms pub in Grimsby tried to free Ms Dixon's airways with the Heimlich manoeuvre but she could not be saved . Paramedics arrived at the pub within eight minutes and took her to the Diana, Princess of Wales hospital, but she could not be saved and died of a lack of oxygen to the brain. Mr Kelly ruled that Ms Dixon's death, which happened on April 1 this year, was accidental. Her daughter Toni Dixon described her mother as a 'generous' person and said: 'She was a very outgoing and confident person who was the life and soul of party and loved to dance.' Following her mother's death, Toni Dixon called for everyone to be trained in first aid.","Sharon Dixon, 54, choked on April 1 at the Wellington Arms pub in Grimsby .

Overpaid: Moya Greene has to pay back the the £250,000 and any capital gains that was made on the property that she bought with it . A controversial £250,000 payment to help the boss of Royal Mail buy a house will have to be repaid to taxpayers after Vince Cable blocked the move, it has emerged. The business secretary, who has to sign off on any pay increase for the head of the postal service, was kept in the dark for more than a year about the huge sum, documents reveal. ‘I would not have approved it,’ Mr Cable said last night. The debacle is a major embarrassment for the company, which is preparing for a £3billion privatisation later this year. Canadian Moya Greene was brought in by ministers three years ago to help shake up the Royal Mail ahead of the sell-off. Last year her package of pay and perks rose by 33 per cent to almost £1.5million, Royal Mail’s accounts last night showed. This included a one-off £250,000 cash sum to help her get on the UK housing ladder - even though she already receives up to £127,000 a year in ‘relocation payments’ because she moved from Canada. She used the money to help buy a house in London in April 2012, sources close to the company confirmed. But Mr Cable only learned about the money when presented with a draft copy of the company’s annual accounts on July 5 this year - a full 15 months later. He immediately demanded that Ms Greene pay the money back - and that taxpayers were reimbursed for any capital gains made on the property since its purchase. A source close to the business secretary said: ‘He felt very strongly about this when he found out.’ Mr Cable said: ‘I am pleased that this unapproved payment is being returned. The company acted quickly to rectify the situation. ‘A mistake was made in not seeking my approval: I would not have approved it. ‘The chairman is sorry; the payment is being returned. I now regard the matter closed.’ He added: ‘Moya Greene is an exceptionally good chief executive and she and the board have my full support to take the company forward.’ Ms Greene has already paid £130,000 in tax on the payment, and will now have to pay back the remaining £120,000, either when the company floats on the stock market or at the end of the financial year. The company has also agreed to pay back any capital gains made on the property. Although Ms Greene’s basic pay was frozen at £498,000, her £1.5million pacakge included a performance-related bonus of £399,000 and £200,000 in lieu of a pension. Her contractual entitlements include two return trips to her native Canada a year, as well as medical cover and financial advice. Fellow Canadian Mark Carney, the new Bank of England governor, receives £250,000 a year in housing allowance as part of his contract. Embarrassing: Business Secretary Vince Cable (left) said he would not have approved the payment and it was a 'mistake' that he was not asked. Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna (right) said an apology is not enough . Royal Mail’s pay committee is led by . Orna Ni-Chionna, who is also the senior independent director at . collapsed music retailer HMV. A . statement in the Royal Mail accounts said: ‘In the exceptional . circumstances of the chief executive’s relocation and commitment to the . UK, additional assistance, on the purchase of a home, was offered given . the difference in residential costs between the UK and Canada. ‘The . chief executive was not involved in the decision nor does she engage . with Government about payments made to her by the company.’ Even though the pay committee admitted it should have sought Mr Cable’s approval, it added: ‘The committee considers it made its decision in good faith in exceptional circumstances.’ Mrs Ni-Chionna, who is married to former City regulator Lord Adair Turner, was paid £60,000 last year for sitting on the Royal Mail board, including £10,000 for chairing the group’s pay committee. Fellow Canadian: Governor of the bank of England Mark Carney is given £250,000 a year as a housing allowance . A spokesman for the Royal Mail last night said: ‘The remuneration committee appreciates that executive remuneration is a sensitive subject in the current economic environment. ‘Under Moya Greene’s leadership, . Royal Mail has been transformed.’ Mario Dunn, from campaign group Save . Our Royal Mail, said: ‘Vince Cable was absolutely right to insist this . allowance was repaid. ‘Yet . he also tells us that it is necessary to privatise Royal Mail precisely . so it can undertake this kind of activity without the government . interfering. ‘Mr Cable . cannot have his cake and eat it.

Ward, from the Communication Workers Union, said: ‘Ordinary postal . workers will be appalled at this excessive, inflation-busting increase . in bonuses for Moya Greene. ‘These pay and bonus figures make Royal Mail’s below-inflation pay offer look even more insulting than it was originally.’ Shadow . business secretary Chuka Umunna said: 'This was a shocking decision . that very much calls into question the judgement of the remuneration . committee.

What started out as a joke to organise a wedding on just £10 has now become a reality for one thrifty couple. Kelsey Courtney and Alice Flannigan believed their longed-for wedding was something they would have to save years for, but now they have just 10 weeks to prepare. The North Tyneside pair, who have been together for almost four years, were chatting and joking with family members when the topic of marriage came up. Kelsey Courtney and her partner Alice Flannigan who with the help of Kelsey's sister Lynn are planning a £10 wedding . The couple thought they would have to save for years to wed and the idea of getting married on a shoe string budget started as a joke . (L-R) Alice, wedding planner Angela Evans, Kelsey, and Lynn Blundell, who are delighted with the donations received so far for the wedding- including the wedding dress! But little did they know a flippant comment from Lynn Blundell, Kelsey’s sister, would change their plans quite so dramatically. Kelsey said: 'We were just sitting round the table and I said to Alice ‘do you want to marry me’? And she said ‘what, with £10’? 'Then Lynn says she’d bet she could do it with a tenner so I told her ‘go on then’.' That was only four days ago and Lynn, of Wallsend, North Tyneside, has already managed to secure a wedding dress, bridesmaids dresses, a reception venue, caterer, DJ, cake, a wedding planner and many more aspects of a wedding that usually take months to source. Lynn says: 'I thought I would try putting something on Facebook to see if anyone had any ideas and it just went from there' The 38-year-old never expected the task, which she has dubbed ‘The £10 Wedding Challenge’, to take off so quickly. She said: 'At first I thought there was no way I was going to do this but I thought I would try putting something on Facebook to see if anyone had any ideas and it just went from there. 'I really didn’t think I would be able to pull it off before the wedding date in October, but it’s only been three days since I started and almost everything is sorted.' Kelsey and Alice are planning to wed on Thursday, October 31 after just a few weeks of preparation . The mum-of-one took to social networking sites to appeal for people and businesses to lend their support and within no time offers were flooding in from generous folk across the region who wanted to help make Kelsey and Alice’s dream wedding come true. Lynn added: 'With all the bad that’s in the world at the minute, it just shows there’s a hell of a lot of good people out there.' Kelsey and Alice are planning to wed on Thursday, October 31, and although the location is yet to be finalised there are a several options available to them. The couple are over the moon at all Lynn has done for them so far and have been bowled over by people’s kindness. 'We’ve been engaged for two-and-a-half years and we were planning to save £50-a-month towards a wedding, so it would’ve been a few years off,' said Kelsey. 'It’s absolutely amazing what’s happened.' Partner Alice has already received the dress she will wear for the ceremony which was donated by Kerry Mannion. 'It’s an amazing dress with a really long train.

Outburst: A judge branded Colin Blake a 'serial rapist' when jailing him for attacking two women in 2010 and 2012 and told him he should never have been cleared of attacks on two other women . A judge has branded a 53-year-old man a 'serial rapist' when jailing him for attacking two women  telling him he should never have been found not guilty of two earlier assaults. Judge Murray Shanks spoke out as he sentenced Colin Blake for attacking a woman in her own home last year and raping a 14-year-old girl in 2010. He said that he had 'no doubt' that Blake had also forced himself on two further victims, aged 13 and 26. Blake was tried for this alleged assaults in two separate hearings in 2006 and 2007 but found not guilty on both occasions. Sentencing Blake at Snaresbrook Crown Court, Judge Shanks said: ‘Somehow you were acquitted by a jury of two previous rapes in 2006 and 2007 of a 13-year-old and a 26-year-old. ‘As I say, you have managed to persuade juries on those occasions and were found not guilty. ‘I have no doubt whatsoever that you raped those women. ‘In other words I am sure you are a serial rapist and you are capable of raping more women. ‘You have lied through all four of the . trials and even though acquitted it did not influence your behaviour, . you just carried on as before. He added: ‘You appear to have no insight as to the harm you have caused to other people. ‘All the evidence I have heard . suggests you are a man who thinks he is entitled to sex at any time . without regard to others’ feelings or even their age.’ Blake targeted his most recent victim, aged 26, in her own home in Woodford Green, east London, in August last year. He had promised to take her out for an evening and asked to come in and wait while she got ready but soon began demanding sex. Sentencing: Judge Shanks told Blake that he feels he 'is entitled to sex at any time without regard to others¿ feelings or even their age' at Snaresbrook Crown Court, pictured . When she turned him down, Blake forced her into her bedroom and raped her twice. The fourth victim was a 14-year-old girl, who was attacked twice by Blake in September 2010. He arranged to meet the teenager on the pretence of buying her new school uniform. But instead he drove her to an address in Hackney, east London, before raping her and driving her home.

Unwitting trail: Olena Tischenko, the Ukrainian friend of a fugitive Kazakh oligarch wanted over a $5billion bank fraud, pictured in London before leading detectives to his hideout in the south of France . A fugitive Kazakh oligarch wanted over a $5billion bank fraud was tracked down to a French villa when a glamorous female friend unwittingly led detectives hundreds of miles to his hideout. Mukhtar Ablyazov was held yesterday after paramilitary police swooped in on a luxury home in the town of Mouans Sartoux, near Nice in south-east France. He is wanted in Kazakhstan on charges of siphoning off at least $5billion from BTA Bank, which based in the central Asian country's business capital, Almaty. The 50-year-old has been wanted in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan over a string of allegations of fraud and organised crime since fleeing the country for London in 2009. He disappeared from the UK in February 2012 just before a British court sentenced him to 22-months in jail for contempt of court in a financial fraud trial. Sources say he was finally found when his blonde Ukrainian friend Olena Tischenko was spotted outside the High Court in London by private investigators hired by BTA on July 22. She had attended a hearing defending legal action brought by the bank. She left court shortly before 6pm and took a taxi to the Cornhill in the city before hailing a second cab to Heathrow. At 10.30pm, she boarded a flight to Nice, where she was driven to her home. There, she changed into a mini skirt and high heels and drove off around an hour later to the luxury Villa Neptune in Miramar on the Cote d'Azur. She parked away from the villa and walked to the property at 3.07am, it was reported by The Evening Standard. Around half an hour later, Ablyazov for spotted for the first time rearranging the bed in his underwear. Ms Tischenko left the villa at lunchtime the following day to go to the beach before flying from Nice to Moscow that evening. Investigators staked out Villa Neptune until Ablyazov drove to one of his other villas, saint Basile in Mouglis last Friday. Mr Tischenko joined him there that evening and stayed the night. The bank then contacted the French authorities on Monday to inform them they had found Ablyazov, who is wanted under an Interpol notice issued by the Ukraine.

He later went to another of his . properties, the 1816 Chemin de Castellaras in mouans-Sartoux, where he . was surrounded by French special forces. The police used 'powerful means'  - . including armoured vehicles and a plane - because Ablyazov was known to . have a 'private militia' at his disposal, said Ms Legras, whose office . focuses on international cases. In the event, no shots were fired during the operation. Ablyazov, . who has been wanted by Interpol since 2009, was held on allegations of . 'large-scale fraud in an organised group', Ms Legras said by phone, . shortly after meeting with Ablyazov to explain the possible extradition . process. A former energy . minister in his home country, Ablyazov later emerged as a prominent . opponent of Kazakhstan's president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has ruled . the energy-rich Central Asian nation since before the Soviet collapse. Shortly . after setting up a pro-reform party in 2001, Ablyazov was sentenced to . six years in prison for abuse of public office. However, he was pardoned . by Mr Nazarbayev and released in 2003, vowing to stay out of politics - . a promise he broke by funnelling money to the opposition. Kazakhstan's prosecutors have . described Ablyazov as the head of an extremist, criminal conspiracy bent . on 'seizing power by inciting civil strife and hatred.'

The . prosecutor in Astana, the Kazakh capital, said Interpol had informed . the government of Ablyazov's arrest, which was carried out at the . request of Ukraine, where he is wanted on charges of alleged . embezzlement of funds from a local branch of the BTA bank. He is also . sought by Russia in connection with embezzlement charges involving BTA . bank and a Russian company. There was no extradition request from . the UK, where Ablyazov was in February 2012 convicted of contempt of . court after attempting to hide the extent of his wealth from a legal . action taken by the now state-owned BTA bank in the hope of recovering . some of the allegedly embezzled funds. Mr Justice Teare, sitting in the High . Court, said Ablyazov was accused of 'fraud on an epic scale' and had . committed 'deliberate and substantial' contempts by breaching an . asset-freezing order imposed to stop money vanishing before litigation . concluded. The conviction . was upheld at the Court of Appeal last November, where senior judge Lord .

British women about to turn 34 are due for a pleasant birthday surprise: it is the age is when they're supposed to feel happiest with their naked bodies, according to a new survey. According to the new research, 34-year-old women finally learn to accept their lumps and bumps - which is good news for Kelly Brook, Caroline Flack, Donna Air and Kate Hudson who are all 34, or due to celebrate their 34th birthdays, this year. The research challenges the notion that Brits are a prudish nation, with 40 per cent of women - the equivalent of 8 million of them - looking at themselves naked in the mirror every day. When women reach 34 - like Caroline Flack and Kelly Brook this year - they are finally happy with their bodies . Both Caroline and Kelly feel comfortable enough in their own skin to post these revealing snaps on Instagram . A further 25 per cent sneak a peek at least once a week and just 16 per cent of British women never look at themselves in the mirror when they're nude. Beautician Nichola Joss says the findings make sense: 'Those in their early to mid-thirties typically have great body confidence. They work hard to maintain the best body shape possible, are educated about eating well and treating their body with respect. 'Many 34 year olds I know have experienced either a loving relationship or close personal friendship and these bring confidence, both inside and out.' When asked their favourite body parts, 30 per cent of those polled revealed they are proud of their breasts, saying they are the body part they most like to flaunt. This is closely followed by legs (22 per cent) and shoulders (19 per cent). When asked what part of their body they would most like to change, the majority (57 per cent) said their stomachs. Yet as we hit peak beach season, British women are in a quandary about what to wear while sun-bathing. Social media is influencing women’s decision-making processes; 65 per cent won’t wear a bikini on holiday for fear of embarrassing photos appearing on Facebook. Elle McPherson, 49, had the best bikini body while Kylie Minogue's bottom came top in the poll . When it comes to Brits’ bikini idols, Elle McPherson, 49, secured the most votes (50 per cent) in the best body category. Kylie Minogue topped the poll for best bottom (43 per cent), closely followed by Jennifer Lopez (32 per cent) and Carol Vorderman (8 per cent). When it comes to killer curves, British is definitely best, with women citing Holly Willoughby (48 per cent), Catherine Zeta Jones (22 per cent) and Nigella Lawson (17 per cent) as the curvy bodies they most envy. Topping the poll for best arms was yoga devotee Jennifer Aniston (47 per cent) followed by former ballerina and Strictly Come Dancing judge Darcey Bussell (25 per cent). Holly Willoughby and Nigella Lawson have the curvy bodies that women most envy . Darcey’s ballerina-sculpted legs are also envied by 16 per cent of British women, second only to Cameron Diaz whose athletic legs are coveted by 35 per cent of Brits. Darcey Bussell, ambassador for Sanctuary Spa Active Reverse Body, who carried out the survey, said: 'For me, body confidence is all about being healthy, strong and happy in my own skin. 'I also think that good posture improves confidence and can take years off your appearance. Always pull out of your waist to create space between your hips and ribs, this improves core strength and helps you to look and feel more confident in your own skin.'

Trolls operate out of a feeling of power, amusement, boredom and revenge and thrive on the anonymity which the internet provides, new research suggests . Boredom is behind many incidents of cyberbullying and trolling on social media sites, according to the first major study into the matter. Linguistics expert Dr Claire Hardaker, of Lancaster University, studied almost 4,000 online cases involving claims of trolling. She has revealed the methods most regularly used by trolls on sites such as Facebook and Twitter to trigger outrage for their own amusement. Trolling is a phenomenon that has swept across websites in recent years where online forums, Facebook pages and newspaper comment forms are bombarded with insults, provocations or threats. Supporters argue that it is about humour, mischief and freedom of speech, but for many the ferocity and personal nature of the abuse verges on hate speech. Trolls operate out of a feeling of . power, amusement, boredom and revenge and thrive on the anonymity which . the internet provides, said Dr Hardaker. She believes people need to be more aware of how trolls operate to counter their effect and, as a result, has identified seven tactics that trolls commonly use and why they are so effective. They . range from deliberately digressing from a subject to focus on a more . sensitive topic to provoke reaction to endangering others by giving . advice, perhaps to cause harm or force others to respond to prevent . harm. Dr Hardaker also . lists other strategies such as shocking others by talking about taboo . topics and repeatedly re-posting the same offensive messages to multiple . groups as 'deadly sins' of cyberbullies. She . said: 'Aggression, deception and manipulation are increasingly part of . online interaction, yet many users are unaware not only that some of . these behaviours exist, but of how destructive and insidious they can . be.' She also warns that trolling can in some cases develop into more serious behaviour, including cyberharassment and cyberstalking. Her research also reveals that trolling is not just about being directly . abusive or shocking, with more covert methods being used to wreck and . cause havoc to online discussions. The research is part of Dr Hardaker's wider work examining the dark side of the internet including bullying, hoaxing, grooming and online harassment. It has been published in the latest edition of the Journal of Language, Aggression and Conflict. Dr Hardaker is currently looking at a range of anti-social internet behaviour including cyberbullying, which has seen a rising number of schoolchildren taking their own lives. Jessie J and Duncan James have both endured trolling and were bombarded with nasty messages on Twitter. Trolling can in some cases develop into more serious behaviour including cyberharassment and cyberstalking . She is also researching trolling and the cases of trolls mocking untimely and tragic deaths online, which are also increasing. A number of celebrities have . become the victims of trolls, including Blue star Duncan James, who . recently revealed he received several homophobic messages on Twitter. The Voice judge Jessie J has also been the subject of abuse on the social media network. However, it is not just celebrities who are being targeted by the trolls, as discussion forums and messageboards are increasingly being hit and disrupted by cyberbullies. Dr Hardaker said: 'The image of trolling is that it is mainly the work of young people, but the fact is trolls come from all ages and backgrounds. 'They will use different strategies to trigger the response they want from people. Some of these are a lot sneakier than others. It is not just about personal abuse. 'An incredible amount of time and strategy can be involved in trolling, as my research into the techniques they use highlights.' Dr Hardaker believes that the aggravation typically springs from the degradation of the 'signal-to-noise' ratio. 'The time-wasting noise of one troll-post is relatively easily ignored, but the noise of hundreds of replies to the troll-post, and complaints about those replies, can entirely drown out the worthwhile content,' she said. Digressing from the topic at . hand, especially onto sensitive topics. Not necessarily overtly . argumentative, this tactic frustrates its targets with its pointlessness . and circularity. Digression onto sensitive topics triggers the . strongest reactions. Hypocriticising, . especially for a fault that the critic then displays him/herself. A simple . tactic, often this is pedantic criticism of grammar, spelling or . punctuation in a post which itself contains proof-reading errors to . provoke exasperated responses from others. Antipathising, . by taking up an alienating position by asking pseudo-naive questions, . for example. This tactic is heavily reliant on deceiving the group it is . aimed at and covertly manipulates egos, sensitivities, morals and . feelings of guilt, usually to trigger emotional responses. It can also . create moral dilemmas. Endangering . others by giving dangerous advice such as encouraging risky behaviour. A . trolling strategy designed to masquerade as help or advice while . actually causing harm and/or forcing others to respond to prevent harm. It relies on the target’s social responsibility and moral obligation. Shocking . others by being insensitive about sensitive topics or explicit about . taboo topics. This appears to succeed mainly due to the strength of . feeling provoked by the deeply personal and extraordinarily hurtful . nature of the troll’s insensitivity. It triggers a desire to retaliate . that is stronger than the desire to deny the troll the satisfaction of a . response. Aggressing . others by insulting, threatening, or otherwise plainly attacking them . without adequate provocation. This is open and deliberate aggression . without any clear justification with the aim of antagonising its target . into retaliating. Crossposting . - sending the same offensive or provocative message to multiple groups . then waiting for the response. The message sent by the troll in this . tactic is totally off topic and irrelevant. This deliberately careless . ‘spamming’ tactic can result in potentially thousands of users being . inundated with unwanted or irrelevant messages.","Research is based on 4,000 online cases involving claims of trolling .

Most holidaymakers were put off by Brighton because of its trendiness, dreadful parking, and the prevalence of clubbers in garish outfits making the most of the town’s famed nightlife. Too much: Holidaymakers are put off Brighton by its overcrowding and rowdy night life . Some of the 2,500 people polled cited Brighton and Hove City Council’s plans to introduce ‘Mx’ – a gender neutral title for transsexuals – on official forms, and gender neutral toilets as a reason why they disliked the town so much. Others accused the locals of having ‘chips on their shoulders’ and said the resort was ‘full of bohemians and bad art’. Brighton topped the poll with 40 per cent of the vote. Blackpool came second on 16 per cent, and Skegness third on 15 per cent. Disliked: Many people polled said the resort was ¿full of bohemians and bad art¿ .

Controversial businesswoman and outspoken commentator Katie Hopkins has taken on mothers doing school runs in her latest rant, saying they are 'bitches because their lives are so boring'. Speaking in light of the guilty conviction of two British school mothers who were arrested for assault following a brawl at the gates of their children's school, Katie took part in a debate with journalist Angela Mollard on Australia's MSN news service, Mornings on Channel 9. Discussing the conviction, Katie - known for her controversial opinions and outspokenness - said it was no surprise to her that the mothers had been brawling, especially given that groups of women are instinctively unkind to one another, and that the lives of 'school run mums' are so monotonous. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Katie Hopkins with her three children, from left, Poppy, Max and India . She said: 'Having too many women in one place is never going to be a good thing, is it? 'And they're always going to fight. I don't know what the collective noun for mums is - a mob? a gaggle? - but too many is going to cause tension. Angela Mollard says Katie Hopkins is guilty of exactly the same 'bitchiness' she sees in other mothers . 'A lot of that is because their lives are pretty boring: they go from the school gate, to coffee mornings with same mums, and back to school gates, and if that's all you do in your life you're going to want to have a scrap every now and then.' Angela said she thought Katie was wrong, and that there is, in fact, a real sense of camaraderie between school gate mothers. She said: ' I think this is a fabrication.

I have a positive . experience with all the mums in my school. 'I've seen people support . each other through cancer, death, problems with children... to paint it . as a catfight is just wrong.' Katie countered that she felt school . gate bitchiness was intrinsically cliquey, adding: 'If you share enough . of your problems, if you have enough cancer, if you have enough death, . you're one of the mob, you fit in. 'But if you work, if you have interests, then you're hated with a passion and a fury.'

The man, believed to be in his twenties, drowned yesterday evening in Hampton, Middlesex, when it is believed his backpack became filled with water. A pair of schoolboys who were sat on the river bank dived in to try and save the man after hearing the screams of a woman who was swimming with him. Tragic: The Hampton river crossing where a man drowned last night after trying to swim across the Thames after missing the last ferry across . Dangerous stretch of water: The unnamed man, thought to be in his 20s, drowned in a stretch of the river close to Hampton Sailing Club . His body was later discovered in shallow water nearby a couple of hours later and the woman was unharmed in the incident . Schoolboys Pete Sullivan and Jack Sweeney, both 15, said they saw the man and woman walking to the ferry's jetty but having missed it they started swimming. Pete, a pupil at Esher High School, said: 'I was sitting by the river with my friends when this man walked along the towpath with a woman who I think was his stepmum. They reached the ferry crossing, but had missed the last one of the day. 'He got about three-quarters of the way across when he just went under the water and didn't come back up. 'Jack and I dived in to see if we . could help. We got to where he was and looked all around the bottom, but . we didn't know where he was.'

My God, he is drowning"". 'She was in a state of shock, so I . told her to calm down and go back to the bank otherwise she was going to . get herself drowned as well.' Earlier in the day the man and woman took the ferry from Hampton to Moulsey Hurst. Hampton Ferry Worker Ben Heath, who described the man as in his 20s or early 30s, said: 'I was expecting them to come over on the return journey before I finished at 6pm but they didn’t. 'It looked like they were going to have a couple of drinks. I think they’d already been drinking. They smelled of it and they sounded a bit drunk. 'Plenty of people go swimming here but nothing like this really happens. Police, fire crews, paramedics and a search helicopter were scrambled to the scene but were too late to save the man. Safe crossing: The man and his female companion decided to swim across the river after missing the last Hampton ferry of the day . Local residents have described the incident as an 'accident waiting to happen' due to the number of people who swim in the river and are unaware of dangerous fast flowing currents. One resident, whose home overlooks the stretch of river, said: 'The police had 20 calls in one day . about people swimming across the river from Hurst Park to the sailing . club despite the warnings of the strong currents and all the boats . passing through. 'When the weather’s hot we have around . 30 children swimming over to the island in the middle of the river . where the sailing club is, they jump off the roof into the water and . cause damage. 'This must be a warning to the kids as . it was an accident waiting to happen, but the kids don’t always know . the danger so it’s up to the parents to make sure they aren’t swimming . there.'

"By . Reuters Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 07:57 EST, 22 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:57 EST, 22 August 2013 . The rate of circumcisions performed on newborn boys in U.S. hospitals dropped 6 per cent over the past three decades, with an especially steep decline in Western states, according to U.S. government data released Thursday. The national rate declined to 58.3 per cent in 2010 from 64.5 per cent in 1979, according to the report from the National Center for Health Statistics. The tally excludes many circumcisions, including those performed in other places such as religious institutions and those performed later in life. All time low: Baby circumcisions are becoming less frequent across the U.S. with a 6 per cent drop over the past three decades . Broadly, rates fell during the 1980s, increased in the 1990s, and fell again in the early 2000s. During the period covered by the data, male newborn circumcision was most common in 1981, at 64.9 per cent, and least common in 2007, at 55.4 per cent. Circumcision is a ritual obligation for infant Jewish boys and is also a common rite among Muslims, who account for the largest share of circumcised men worldwide. The wider U.S. population adopted the practice due to potential health benefits, such as reducing the risk of urinary tract infections in infants and cutting the risk of penile cancer and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. Still, the practice has been the subject of heated debate, including efforts to ban circumcision in San Francisco and Germany. The American Academy of Pediatrics said last August that the health benefits of infant circumcision outweigh the risks of the surgery. The National Center for Health Statistics offered little explanation in the report for the falling rates but said fluctuations over the years followed changes to the American Academy of Pediatrics' assessment of the procedure's medical value. The center's findings were based on annual discharge data of between 7,000 and 12,000 newborn boys at between 250 and 550 U.S. short-stay, non-federal hospitals. In Western states, the rate dropped to 40.2 per cent in 2010 from 63.9 per cent in 1979, the center said. Rates in the Northeast were flat overall. In the Midwest, they mirrored national trends. In the South, they increased from 1979 until 1998 and then declined. A variety of factors could be at work. The federal Medicaid program for the poor has stopped paying for circumcisions in some 18 U.S. states, and some insurers have balked at paying for a procedure without a strong medical justification. Hospitalization lengths over the decades for mothers and newborns have come to be measured in hours, rather than days, prompting more circumcisions to be done in outpatient settings, said Douglas Diekema, a professor of pediatrics at Seattle Children's Hospital. The margin of error varies across the data in the report. The national rate, for example, has a relative standard error of roughly 3 percent to 5 percent.","Baby circumcisions in the U.S. have dropped 6 per cent over the past three decades .

Most new homes in London are being sold to foreign buyers at overseas events before they are built or advertised in the UK, according to a property group. Three-quarters of new homes in the centre of the capital were sold to overseas buyers in 2012, with more than half going to those in the Far East. Data from Knight Frank showed a rising proportion of mid-market homes were being sold to foreign buyers, who have traditionally favoured the most expensive properties, but that prices were rising. Sold: Many homes in central London are bought by foreign purchasers before they are even advertised in the UK . The worrying trend means British housebuyers, particularly first-time buyers, could find themselves priced out of London, where house prices have risen to a three-year high. Tom Rundall, from Knight Frank, told the Financial Times that foreign buyers were buying average-priced homes in the capital as well as high-end properties. He said: 'We have seen a sea change over the past year in terms of the kind . of price point foreign buyers are chasing, whether it's a studio . apartment in Clerkenwell or a one-bed flat in Kings Cross. 'This is not the jet-set but rather the working middle classes expanding . into the world.' Many of the new homes are sold 'off-plan' - before they are built - at glamorous events in Singapore, Hong Kong, China and Malaysia, where developers can sell more properties in a weekend than they do in the UK in a month.

Vice President Joe Biden's son Beau has left a Houston hospital after undergoing a complicated brain biopsy procedure and is returning to his home state of Delaware with his father. The vice president's office said 44-year-old Beau, who is the attorney general of Delaware, would fly aboard Air Force Two along with his father. Beau Biden underwent the medical procedure at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center on Tuesday. The procedure came more than two weeks after emergency dispatchers were called to the vice president's Delaware home, where his son was staying, in response to a report of a possible stroke. Three years ago, Beau Biden suffered a minor stroke. Happy farewell: Beau Biden posted this picture of him standing with his wife, stepmother Jill and father Joe as he was about to leave the Houston hospital . In a statement released by the White House, the vice president and his wife Jill said their son underwent 'a successful procedure,' but they did not provide any details. 'He is in great shape and is going to be discharged tomorrow and heading home to Delaware,' they said in the statement Wednesday. 'He will follow up with his local physicians in the coming weeks.' The White House declined to answer any questions about what procedure was performed, including whether it was diagnostic or therapeutic in nature. They did, however, announce yesterday that Joe . Biden has canceled scheduled appearances in Rhode Island and Maine today to remain in Houston with his son and other family members. Pattern: Beau Biden, son of the Vice President, has undergone a procedure at a Texas cancer center after taking ill last week. It has now been revealed that 911 was called to his house weeks prior . Beau Biden, 44, had been suffering from weakness and disorientation while vacationing in Indiana last week. A 911-call was made, and a county dispatch center log indicates . that someone at the vice president's home was reported to be possibly . having a stroke and apparently not alert. Biden then arrived on Monday in Houston for tests at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Emergency responders were also called earlier this month to the home where he had been staying, two weeks before he was hospitalized during a family vacation, authorities said on Wednesday. Biden had been staying at his father's Greenville home while his own house is renovated. The younger Biden has a history of neurological problems and suffered a mild stroke in 2010. What's wrong? The Vice President's son had a stroke in 2010. The White House released a statement from Joe and Jill Biden Wednesday announcing Beau had undergone an unnamed procedure . Rickie Clark, a staff supervisor with the Cranston Heights Fire Co., confirmed on Wednesday that county dispatchers received a call for help from Joe Biden's home. However, he refused to provide further details. The dispatch log on the fire department's website shows two references to the vice president's home on Aug. 1, one at 9:25 p.m. and another about a minute and a half later. Both cite ‘Cva-Not Alert,’ indicating that a person was in distress and apparently not alert or responsive to his or her surroundings. Clark said ‘Cva’ is shorthand for cerebrovascular accident, or stroke. Biden was initially admitted to Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago last week and traveled the next day to the Philadelphia hospital where he had been treated for his 2010 stroke to consult with his doctor. He spent last weekend at home in Wilmington before going to Texas. All clear: The Biden's motorcade was seen leaving the Houston hospital Thursday morning . Julie Penne, a spokeswoman for the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said Wednesday that she did not have any information on Biden. The younger Biden has posted two photos of himself in recent days - one of him smiling with his father on Sunday, the other of him smiling with his wife, Hallie, on Tuesday. ‘Touched by all your well wishes--thank you. Nice evening in Houston w/ Hallie; will share update when we have it,’ said the tweet accompanying the photo with his wife.

At least nine people, six of them children, were killed and two dozen were wounded on Saturday in a suicide bomb attack targeting the Indian consulate in Afghanistan's Jalalabad city, near the border of Pakistan. Three insurgents drove in a car towards the consulate when they were stopped by checkpoint guards. Graphic content below . Attack: A suicide bomber attacked the Indian consulate in the eastern Afghan capital of Jalalabad. Government officials and local police confirmed that nine people, including six local children, were killed and around 24 were wounded . Civilians: An Afghan policeman carries a child at the site of the suicide attack . Horrifying: Though there were no casualties within the consulate the attack marks a severe breach of security on Indian-owned territory . One attacker detonated the . explosives-laden vehicle, while the other two were gunned down by . security forces in an exchange of fire. Three Afghan policemen were among the . injured. Most of the casualties were children as the explosion occurred . near a mosque where dozens of children were attending religious classes . in the city, 120 km east of Kabul, provincial police chief Sharifullah . Amin said. The blast was so powerful that pieces of bodies landed inside the consulate and window panes were shattered. An Indian diplomat said: ""We had operated our security plan and an alert was there, so we were well prepared."" Though the consulate staff was unhurt, the incident has exposed the vulnerability of Indian missions in the war-torn nation. In New Delhi, India's External Affairs Ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin confirmed that all Indian officials in the consulate were safe, and then hinted that the assault had been planned outside Afghanistan. The attack occurred on a day when Mail Today reported that India had warned its ambassador to Kabul, Amar Sinha, of a plot by Pakistan-based bombers to assassinate him, and recommended that he not leave home without a bullet-proof jacket nor travel in a convoy of less than three armoured Land Cruisers. Despite the warning, the government did not make tighter security arrangements at its establishments in Afghanistan. Top sources told Mail Today that the government is now going to send an elite contingent of 50 more ITBP commandoes to guard Indian missions in that country. The warning of the specific threat to the Indian envoy in Kabul was based on communication intercepts by New Delhi. Explosives: An Afghan Army soldier shows a diffused bomb used at the scene. Only one of the attackers died in the actual blast . Danger: Security forces said the bombers' target was the Indian consulate, but they were identified by police about 100 metres away, so they detonated the explosives close to a mosque . Aftermath: Crowds gather at the crater formed by the initial blast . Sources privy to the communication had told Mail Today the intercepts speak of the ISI paying half a million rupees to two militants of the Taliban's Haqqani network in Afghanistan to attack the envoy. Response: The ministry of external affairs Syed Akbaruddin said the attack was a tragedy for Afghanistan as much as it was a security scare for India . The Jalalabad attack happened three days after a team, led by Malay Sinha, a police official in charge of security functions in the Foreign Office, visited Indian missions in Afghanistan for security review. India has been the target of terror strikes in the past. In October 2009, a Taliban suicide bomber attacked the Indian embassy in Kabul, killing at least 17 people. None of the Indian officials were injured in the attack. In July 2008, a suicide bomber rammed . a car full of explosives into the gates of the Indian embassy, killing . 58 people, including senior Indian diplomat V Venkateswara Rao and . Brigadier Ravi Datt Mehta. On . Saturday, the Afghan provincial government said: ""The attackers tried . to assault the consulate office. But the security forces were alerted . about the attack on the compound."" Zabihullah Mujahid, a purported Taliban spokesman, told local media . from undisclosed location that Taliban insurgents were not behind the . attack. Indian . ambassador Sinha, who was called to Delhi for consultations and to meet . senior officials, including new Foreign Secretary Sujata Singh, was . asked to stay back for an additional day, as India braces up for a . strategy to deal with the fresh cycle of violence against Indian . interests in Afghanistan.","Attack on Indian consulate in Afghanistan's Jalalabad city .

The Renoir Estate Collection is set to be sold in New York on September 19 as 143 lots with an estimated value of $3 million. The sale includes 19 original sculptural plaster models, or maquettes, created during Renoir's twilight years between 1913 and 1918 with the help of a young assistant, Richard Guino. A dedicated artist who painted every day of his life, Renoir died in 1919. His . personal archive remained with his heirs until 2005 when his grandson .

'These . personal Renoir pieces will be seen for the last time as a unique . collection unless a single buyer is able to purchase all the lots.' Other objects in the sale include Renoir's polka-dotted silk scarf, marriage license and a notebook full of critic's reviews. Renoir's poignant last work, The Woodcocks, was painted the day he died in 1919 and is the only painting in the collection . Renoir's personal items will be up for sale in New York in September at an estimated value of $3million for the 143 lots . The Grande Venus Victorieuse by Renoir created in 1914-1915 is estimated to fetch $900,000 to $1 million . There . are letters from his contemporaries Claude Monet and Edouard Manet; his . Legion of Honor medals; hundreds of glass-plate negatives; and . documents relating to the construction of Les Collettes, his estate at . Cagnes-sur-Mer. Several museums, reached for comment, declined to say if they would bid. The collection 'illuminates the . career, life and eminence of this very, very humble man,' said Brian .

"By . Snejana Farberov . PUBLISHED: . 10:30 EST, 22 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:22 EST, 22 August 2013 . A foster mother testifying in the trial of a Washington state couple accused of abusing their adopted Ethiopian daughter to death told the jury Wednesday that their other son was rail-thin and covered in scratches when she took him in. The testimony from Sheila Jackson came on day 18 of the murder trial of Larry and Carri Williams, from Sedro-Woolley -- a town about halfway between Seattle and Vancouver, British Columbia. The couple allegedly left their 13-year-old adopted daughter, Hana, to starve and die in the cold in May 2011 after brutally punishing her and her step-brother, Immanuel. Happier times: Hana Williams, seen in this undated photo looking healthy, was found frozen and starved to death in the yard of her adoptive parents' home in 2011 . Parents on trial: Larry and Carri Williams are charged with homicide by abuse in connection with their daughter's death, and first-degree assault of a child stemming from mistreatment of their son, Immanuel . Jackson, who is deaf, told the jury in a Mount Vernon courtroom that when the Williamses’ son Immanuel, who was also adopted from Ethiopia, came to live with her, she could barely keep up with his demands for food. 'He ate fast. He ate a lot. He ate more than I expected,' she told on the stand, the station KIRO-TV reported . Following the couple's arrest, Child Protective Services removed Immanuel, who is deaf, and seven other children from their home. Larry and Carri Williams have been charged with assaulting Immanuel and killing their adopted 13-year-old daughter, who was found starved and frozen to death in their backyard in May 2011. Sheila Jackson said the boy was terrified to talk about his adoptive parents. Bad memories: Immanuel, who was adopted by the couple from Ethiopia along with Hana, testified that he had endured beatings and abuse as punishment for misbehaving . Withering away: Hana, pictured left sometimes after her arrival in the U.S., lost nearly 30lbs between 2009 and 2011, and had her head shaven when she was found dead in the backyard . Angelic: Hana, pictured second left, seen as a young girl with her family back in Ethiopia . According to the foster mother, the child was so emaciated that his ribs were showing through his skin covered in markings from past beatings. Immanuel, now 12 years old, testified during the trial that the Williamses beat him and Hana with belts and switches. Lingering fear: Foster mother Sheila Jackson, who took in Immanuel after the Williamses' arrest, said the boy was very thin, always hungry and terrified to talk about his adoptive parents . The parents kept the family isolated from non-relatives, home-schooled the children and followed strict religious principles described in the Christian parenting book titled ‘To Train Up a Child,’ investigators said. As punishment for bad behaviour, the teen told the court that he and his step-sister were fed frozen meals, hosed down and forced to sleep in closets, where they would listen to recordings of the Bible on tape and Christian music. The defense has attempted to paint Immanuel as a disobedient boy with an attitude problem. The lawyers for the couple said Immanuel hit and bit Jackson’s daughter so badly that her teacher ended up calling CPS after the child came to school with bruises. Sheila Jackson said that Immanuel has been getting counselling and his behaviour has been improving. In 2008, Immanuel was 7 years old when the American couple, both devout Christians, adopted him and Hana from Ethiopia. Larry worked at Boeing while his wife was a stay-at-home mom home-schooling the two adopted kids and their seven biological children. In his testimony last month, the 12-year-old told the court that his adopted parents would beat him with a stick until blood was running down his face. Other disciplinary measures included having Immanuel hosed down in the yard for bed-wetting and keeping him and Hana outside in the cold. Tough disciplinarians: Hana and her adoptive brother were allegedly spanked, hit with sticks, hosed down and forced to eat frozen food . Cruel death: Hana's emaciated body covered in bruises was found face down in the mud in the backyard of the family's home in Sedro-Woolley, Washington . Cause of death: An autopsy showed that the 13-year-old died from hypothermia exacerbated by malnutrition and gastritis . 'I would suffer with the pain until it eventually went away,' he said in sign language July 29. Larry’s attorney, Rachel Forde, characterized the Ethiopian boy as a troublemaker who lied to his adoptive parents and refused to do lessons assigned by his mother. While the couple's biological children, five of whom had testified during the trial, were generally treated better, the strict rules in the Williams household applied to them as well. According to Joseph Williams, however, he and his siblings were given the authority to punish and even spank their adopted brother and sister, KIRO-TV reported. Last Friday, Joseph was called to the stand to describe the night of May 12, 2011, when his 13-year-old adopted sister died. Joseph Williams told the court that after Hana died while sitting in the yard in 40-degree weather, his mother instructed him to bring the girl's body inside, where she performed CPR and called 911. The mother of nine said on the call that her daughter Hana 'has killed herself.' Blaming the victim: On a 911 call after Hana's death, Carri Williams (left) told the dispatcher that her 'rebellious' adopted daughter had killed herself by throwing herself down to the ground and refusing to come indoors . When asked by the 911 dispatcher why she believed her daughter had taken her own life, Williams said that the girl was not breathing and lying face down in the mud after refusing to come indoors, according to the Seattle Times. Calling Hana 'rebellious,' the mother said that she had seen the 13-year-old throwing herself to the ground and staggering about the yard after taking her clothes off. A local weather station reported that the temperature that night was 42 degrees. First responders arrived just after midnight and rushed Hana to Skagit Valley Hospital, where she was pronounced dead an hour later. Her bone-thin body was covered in bruises, including a lump on her shaved head, red bloody markings on her hips, elbows and face. An autopsy report concluded that the girl died from hypothermia, with malnutrition and chronic gastritis as contributing factors. According to the girl’s medical records, between 2009 and 2011, she had lost nearly 30lbs and was short for her age. Larry and Carri Williams were arrested September 29, 2011, on charges of homicide by abuse in connection with their daughter's death, and first-degree assault of a child stemming from mistreatment of Immanuel. If convicted, each faces a prison term of between 20 and 29 years, according to state sentencing guidelines.","Sheila Jackson told the court Immanuel, 12, was emaciated, scared and always hungry .

Three million Time Warner Cable customers in New York, Los Angeles, Dallas and other cities remained without access to CBS on Sunday, meaning they could miss Tiger Woods' attempt to win the Bridgestone Invitational. The cable provider cut off CBS for viewers in those markets on Friday, saying the network is demanding retransmission fees that are out of line with what it pays other broadcasters. CBS says it's never been dropped by a cable provider before and that it has successfully negotiated deals with other providers including AT&T, Cablevision, Comcast, DirecTV and Verizon. CBS blackout: Time Warner Cable has pulled the plug on CBS in several cities in a dispute over broadcasting fees . A spokeswoman for Time Warner, Maureen Huff, said Sunday that 'talks continue.' A representative for CBS declined to comment on the status of the negotiations. The two New York-based companies have been taking their cases to the public, with full-page print ads in local papers. Time Warner Cable customers who turned to CBS this weekend were also greeted by a message on white screen saying the network had made 'outrageous demands' for fees. It advised viewers that they could still see their favorite shows through several ways, including 'using an antenna to get CBS free over the air.' Although CBS sends its signal out over the airwaves for free to anyone with an antenna, about 85 per cent of CBS viewers watch TV through a pay TV provider. CBS is trying to gain revenue from retransmission fees as a buffer against swings in advertising revenue. Analysts say earning revenue from pay TV subscribers is crucial to the network's growth prospects. Time Warner, meanwhile, says giving in to demands for higher fees would result in skyrocketing bills for customers. DirecTV came to the defense of its competitor, saying it applauded Time Warner for 'fighting back against exorbitant programming cost increases.' Three million Time Warner Cable customers in New York, Los Angeles and Dallas see this message when they switch channel to CBS . Time Warner is trying to hold down . costs as it fights to keep subscribers. In the most recent quarter, it . lost 191,000 cable TV subscribers, ending with 11.7 million at the end . of June.

CBS Corp. grew net income 11 per cent to $472 million on stronger revenue. Time Warner said Friday that CBS refused to have . productive negotiations, which were repeatedly extended after their . previous deal expired at the end of June. 'It's . become clear that no matter how much time we give them, they're not . willing to come to reasonable terms,' Time Warner Cable said. CBS . said it regretted Time Warner Cable's decision, calling it . 'ill-advised.' The broadcaster said it asked for an extension, but that . Time Warner Cable didn't agree to it. Most . of the cable subscribers affected live in New York, Los Angeles and . Dallas, but customers in other markets also lost signals. Viewers are missing out on CBS shows such as 'Under the Dom' The CBS stations that went dark are . WCBS and WLNY in New York; KCBS and KCAL in Los Angeles; KTVT and KTXA . in Dallas; WBZ and WSBK in Boston; KDKA, WPCW-CW in Pittsburgh; KCNC in . Denver; WKBD-CW in Detroit and WBBM in Chicago. About . 2.5 million Time Warner Cable customers also lost access to Showtime, . the premium channel that carries shows such as 'Dexter.' TMC, FLIX and . Smithsonian channels - all owned by CBS Corp. - also went dark. In . its message to subscribers, Time Warner Cable said it would replace the . lost programming with shows from Starz Kids and Family temporarily. The . fight centers on the rising fees that TV station owners like CBS charge . cable and satellite companies to retransmit their content. Research . firm SNL Kagan estimates retransmission fees will reach $3 billion . industry-wide this year and double to $6 billion by 2018. SNL Kagan analyst Robin Flynn said that figure could be revised upward soon as TV station groups merge to gain leverage at the bargaining table. For example, Tribune Co. announced plans to buy Local TV to form a group of 42 TV stations last month. Earning revenue from pay TV subscribers is crucial to CBS's growth prospects, analysts say. Even though CBS sends its signal out over the airwaves for free to anyone with an antenna, about 85 per cent of its viewers watch TV through a pay TV provider. Such fees ensure the company is not so reliant on advertising dollars, which rise and fall with the economy. Meanwhile, Time Warner Cable is fighting to hold the line on costs as it struggles to keep subscribers. It lost 191,000 cable TV subscribers in the most recent quarter, ending with 11.7 million at the end of June. Even as the dispute lingered on, both companies posted healthy quarterly earnings this week. About 2.5 million Time Warner Cable customers have also lost access to Showtime, the premium channel that carries shows such as 'Dexter' Time Warner Cable subscribers are set to miss out on the chance to watch Tiger Woods at the PGA Championship as a result of the dispute . Time Warner Cable grew its net income six per cent to $481 million, or $1.64 per share, as revenue rose three per cent to $5.6 billion. CBS . grew net income 11 percent to $472 million, or 76 cents per share. CBS's revenue also grew 11 percent to $3.7 billion thanks in large part . to the fees that are in dispute with Time Warner Cable. Jonathan . Atkin, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said TV distributors are . taking a stand because programming costs are going up about 10 per cent . this year, an increase that's too high to pass onto customers. 'They feel pressure when some of these cost drivers are going up the way they are,' Atkin said. 'They do need to show some teeth and try to negotiate something better.' He . said the dispute would probably end quickly to avoid depriving . customers of key sporting events, like the PGA Championship starting on . Thursday.

Hospitals should be run more like TV show Bargain Hunt to ensure the NHS gets the best value for money, a health minister said yesterday. Conservative Dan Poulter said hospitals should take a leaf out of the book of the programme’s former host, antiques expert David Dickinson. Dr Poulter said: ‘I’m not expecting a David Dickinson at every hospital, but if we want to cut waste in our NHS and divert more money into front line patient care, the health service needs to know a good bargain when it sees one. Conservative Dan Poulter (left) said hospitals should take a leaf out of the book of Bargain Hunt's former host, antiques expert David Dickinson (right) ‘The economic climate has meant that households across the UK are trying to make their money go further, bargain hunting is no longer just for the thrifty, but a commonplace part of modern life.’ In an attempt to save £1.5billion a year Dr Poulter will today announce plans to require hospitals to publish how much they pay for goods and services so that patients and the public can compare them. Some NHS trusts are paying three times as much as others for prosthetic limbs, rubber gloves and syringes. In some cases hospitals spend £56.50 for a box of 100 surgical gloves while a comparable glove is available for £34.90 per 100. A standard 10cm x 10cm polyurethane foam dressing is available for £11.74 per pack of ten, but some trusts still prefer to purchase a brand that costs £19.87 per pack of ten, a price difference of 74 per cent per pack. And while some hospitals spend just 98p on a tube of lubricant for internal examinations, others cough up £2.77 for the same product. Some NHS trusts are paying three times as much as others for prosthetic limbs, rubber gloves and syringes . Health Department sources say the NHS spends £10.5million on rubber gloves alone, a cost officials now plan to halve. The saving would fund 844 more hip replacement operations or 6,754 cataract operations every year. Dr Poulter, a GP himself, will announce that he is appointing a new NHS procurement champion with private sector expertise to drive down costs. He said: ‘The Government is putting an extra £12.7billion into our NHS but that money needs to be spent much more wisely by local hospitals. 'When our NHS is the single biggest organisation in the UK, hospitals must wake up to the potential to make big savings and radically change the way they buy supplies, goods, services and how they manage their estates. ‘We must end the scandalous situation where one hospital spends hundreds of thousands more than another hospital just down the road on something as simple as rubber gloves or syringes, simply because they haven’t got the right systems in place to ensure value for money for local patients. ‘This kind of poor resource management cannot go on, and this radical new strategy will help our NHS get a grip on wasteful spending to drive real change and improved procurement practices so that more of our NHS’s resources can be spent on frontline patient care.’","Conservative Dan Poulter said hospitals should take a leaf out of the book of the show's former host .

Relatives of Mark Duggan are demanding justice over his death after he was shot by police two years ago . Relatives of Mark Duggan are demanding justice over his death which sparked a national wave of riots and looting after a watchdog said the officers involved did not break the law. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it had found no evidence of criminality by officers in the shooting of Mr Duggan. His family joined justice campaigners at a meeting last night along with speakers including supporters of Cynthia Jarrett, whose death after police raided her home sparked the Broadwater Farm riots in Tottenham, north London, in the 1980s. The police watchdog has been investigating whether any of the 11 CO19 firearms officers involved in Mr Duggan's shooting committed any wrongdoing, but a spokeswoman said today: 'We have found no evidence to indicate criminality at this stage.' As she attended the meeting in Tottenham, Mr Duggan's aunt, Carole Duggan, told Sky News: 'They've been incompetent from day one. 'They've had to apologise to us as a family on numerous occasions because they've not investigated thoroughly. They've not been transparent at all.' Earlier she said she wanted the officers involved to be prosecuted. 'It's been two years and we are now waiting for the inquest to get the answers to the questions we have about how and why Mark was killed,' she said. Mark Duggan's death sparked riots in Tottenham which spread throughout the country . 'We expect those responsible for Mark's death to be prosecuted and for justice to be served.' A large crowd gathered at the event where attendees discussed their ongoing battles for the truth about their loved ones' deaths. Civil rights activist Suresh Grover said campaigners needed to make sure there was not a cover up of what happened on the day Mr Duggan died. He told Sky News: 'The inquest will start soon. 'This is the anniversary to remember him and to develop a strategy which makes sure that the police are held accountable and that any investigative process that takes place is done thoroughly and properly and people are given the truth and there is no cover up on this issue.'

"By . Anna Edwards . PUBLISHED: . 23:14 EST, 1 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:20 EST, 2 August 2013 . A cash-strapped council has been slammed for spending an eye-watering £361,800 on iPads for councillors - claiming that the purchases 'saves money on printing costs'. Shropshire Council announced last week they will be axing up to 1,700 jobs as they look to cut £80 million from their budget. But town hall chiefs caused outrage after figures revealed they had splashed out the staggering amount of taxpayers cash on iPad tablets over the past four years. Council chiefs said iPad usage improved 'productivity' and saved money on printing and administration . Shockingly, the average price for each of the 650 devices given to councillors and officers works out at £557 per iPad. The average retail price of the swanky electronic devices is between £330 - £390. Yesterday the authority defended the decision by claiming the move had saved £20,000 each year on their stationary and printing budget. But local residents and campaigners were quick to point out the bill still leaves a deficit of £281,000. The Taxpayers Alliance said local residents living in the county would be 'dismayed' by the figures. Campaign manager Eleanor McGrath said: 'In order to have the moral authority to oversee necessary cuts in expenditure, councillors and council staff must ensure that any spending on themselves is necessary and delivering taxpayer value for money. Councillor Kevin Pardy said iPads are a necessity and a must for he needs instant information . 'It is certainly open to debate as to whether they needed the taxpayer to provide them with brand new tablet computers, but what's for sure is that people will be astounded to discover that they have been issuing themselves with iPads. 'These are expensive, top-of-the-range, premium products and if they need a council-issue tablet at all, they should be looking at the cheaper alternatives which are available. 'Shropshire residents will certainly be dismayed at how the savings in printing costs are belittled by the vast bill for the iPads.' Local resident Geoff Mills, 42, who lives in Telford, Shropshire, added: 'They are cutting jobs left, right and centre and then spending thousands on sleek swanky devices for councillors. 'If its saving £20,000 each year but they are spending £360,000 on them - it seems like stupid maths to me. 'By the time they've paid for themselves almost 14 years down the line, they will probably be obsolete and they will spend it all again on the latest devices. 'They are luxury items and not a necessity. 'This funding should go to something much more worthwhile.' Disability campaigner Nicky Clark, who launched the Shropshire cares campaign in 2010, said: 'They can do exactly the same functions on their existing Smartphone's and Blackberries as they can do on iPads. 'These people are gadget crazy bureaucrats who are deciding how the rest of us should live our lives. 'They're plundering services which are a lifeline to people and yet spend money on things like this.' The Freedom of Information request shows the authority spent the cash on the tablet computers between April 2009 and May 2013. It revealed that 63 out of the 75 elected councillors in Shropshire now use iPads, with the rest being used by officers . Figures show 49 people have been given iPads on top of electronic devices such as laptops, mobile phones and Blackberries. And the monthly cost to Shropshire Council for iPad 3G data is £4,062.50, meaning the bill is £48,750 annually. Council chiefs said iPad usage improved 'productivity' and saved money on printing and administration. Newly-elected councillor Kevin Pardy, who represents the Sundorne ward, said the iPads were 'a must'. He said: 'Before I became a councillor, I thought the iPad was a luxury but I now realise it is a necessity and at a time when I and my constituents need instant information it is a must.' Shropshire Council said the iPads helped keep councillors connected with their electorate and increased productivity levels. A spokesman said: 'Mobile computer tablets have been made available to staff and councillors to improve productivity and save money on printing and administrative costs. 'Anyone who wants to use a tablet has to have a sound business case for doing so, explaining how it would help them to do their job and save the council time and money. 'Since councillors have been using iPads, very few committee reports are now printed before meetings, which as well as improving the efficiency of the department has already produced ongoing savings.

One of Britain's most high-profile fashion bosses has announced she will be joining occasionwear brand Coast as CEO, following her departure from ASOS after just seven months. Kate Bostock - who was ousted from M&S in October 2012 after a slump in sales and replaced by Belinda Earl, the woman behind the new Annie Liebovitz campaign - will start her new role as Chief Executive Officer in September. The 56-year-old made a hasty exit from online giant ASOS last month saying it 'isn't the right place for me'. In her new role Bostock - who previously held senior roles at Next and George - will work closely with Coast Chairman . Derek Lovelock and the senior management team. Her . resignation as ASOS' director of product was revealed by founder Nick . Robinson, who explained that the average age of staff at the firm is . between 27 and 28, prompting an ageism row. Robertson said: 'Strategy wasn’t the issue. It was more about cultural . fit and time of life. 'Our average age is . 27 or 28. People get to a stage in their career where they’re either up . for a very big challenge or they're not.'

Bostock will join occasionwear brand Coast next month, working closely with Chairman Derek Lovelock and the senior management team . One headhunter who specialises in recruiting retail executives said she was appalled by Robertson's comment. 'It's an absolute ageist comment that . was directed at Kate because she was a woman,' said Moira Benigson, . managing partner of executive search group MBS. 'If the job had gone to a . man of the same calibre would people have said that? 'They are suggesting she is past her . sell-by date, so when's the cut off? Is it when menopause starts?

Influential: Kate Bostock, previously head of merchandising at rival retailer Marks & Spencer, has quit a senior post at Asos . Brief stint: Nick Robertson, chief executive of Asos, said he was 'disappointed that things haven't worked out' as Ms Bostock's departure was announced . Kate Bostock's career trajectory has . seen her work her way up from a design role at a now defunct knitwear . manufacturer in the East Midlands to become a key player at some of the . biggest names in British retail. Fresh . out of fashion college in Derby, Bostock secured a position at the now . dissolved clothing manufacturer Klynton Davies, before moving on to Bent . & Son, party plan firm Pippa Dee and Charnwood Designs. She . joined high street staple Next in 1995, where she would remain as . director of kidswear until 2001 when she moved to Asda as product . director for the supermarket giant's George clothing brand. She . spent three years at Asda before being hired by Marks & Spencer in . 2004, where she rose to become executive director of general merchandise . on a package worth almost £1m. Last . July Marks & Spencer reported dismal quarterly figures and . announced that Ms Bostock would be leaving as head of clothing as part . of a management shake-up. She stepped down from the board in October . 2012. Online retailer . Asos set about courting Ms Bostock and she took up a position as . director of product and trading in January 2013 in what was widely . hailed as a major coup for the firm. The . 56-year-old's latest post came with an undisclosed salary that . reportedly represented a cut on what she was earning at rival retailer . Marks & Spencer. On . Tuesday, after just seven months at Asos, it was announced that Ms . Bostock had quit after agreeing with chief executive Nick Robertson the . firm was 'not the right platform for her talent'. Bostock said simply: 'Sadly I’ve . concluded that Asos is not the right place for me.' Announcing . Bostock's departure on Monday, multimillionaire retail tycoon Robertson said: 'Kate and I have agreed that ASOS is not the right . platform for her talent. 'Of course we are disappointed that things . haven't worked out and Kate leaves with our very best wishes.' He was reported as saying: 'I'd love . to say it was more sinister and complicated, but she gave it six months . and decided it wasn't for her.' Insiders said that while it was . Bostock's decision to leave, it was potentially driven by something of a . culture clash. She joined ASOS after last year . leaving Marks & Spencer, where she was considered the queen of . fashion, having risen to run its clothing business. Marks & Spencer is traditional in . its approach to retailing and its products are aimed at a broader church . of shoppers whereas ASOS is aimed at 20-somethings, with an internet . focus. Previously she had worked at Next, which she joined in 1995, . working her way up to director of childrenswear before moving to Asda in . 2001, where she worked as product director for its George clothing . brand. Her experience meant she was regarded as one of the key voices in the fashion retail world. She was brought in as Asos retail . director on an undisclosed salary after Mr Robertson said he had wanted . to appoint a 'big retail hitter to take the business on to the next . level'. One retail executive said: 'It was . never going to be a marriage made in heaven - she's hardcore and he's . king of flying by the seat of his pants.' ASOS, which stands for As Seen On . Screen, started life in 2000 marketing copies of clothes worn by famous . people. It now sells a wide range of clothing, from high street names to . high-end fashion. It is also running a trial selling items for Primark, which has no other online presence.

But unlike many, Stenman made his American Dream reality - by building a house entirely out of paper. And the unique property in Rockport, Massachusetts, U.S., has stood the test of time - its paper walls, paper furniture and even paper grandfather clock are going strong after more than 90 years. Scroll down for video . Cut-out cottage: The house in Rockport, Massachusetts, US, is built entirely out of paper . Fully functional: The house comes fitted with electricity and running water, despite its apparently flimsy building materials . While the framework of the house is wooden, the walls are made from layers and layers of newspaper, which are glued and varnished to strengthen them. Stenman, a mechanical engineer who designed the machines that make paper clips, began building the house as a hobby. He began his project in 1922 and completed it in 1924. The house opened as a museum in the 1930s. Mr Stenman's great niece Edna Beaudoin now runs the Paper House, after taking it on from her mother. Ms Beaudoin said: 'Rain blows in, sometimes snow, but it's held up pretty well considering how old it is. 'Elis was curious and wanted to see what would happen to the paper, and well, here it is, some 90 years later. Kitted out: The house has paper walls, paper furniture and even a paper piano . Building blocks: Little paper logs were cut with a craft knife and glued or nailed together . 'There's lots of varnish on the Paper House walls. But we don't varnish the inside of the house because the more you put on, the darker it gets and we really just like to leave it so you can still read the papers.' Mr Stenman lived in the Paper House during the summer months from 1924 to 1930. After the wall material was made and he was already living inside the house, he made the furniture. 'The furniture is made out of little paper logs,' said Ms Beaudoin. 'The little rolls of paper are maybe a half inch thick and they're all cut to different sizes - cut with a knife. Then they're glued or nailed together.' Mr Stenman lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Well equipped: A paper piano and a grandfather clock which is made from a paper from each of the 48 states that made up the U.S. at the time . News desk: This table is made entirely from old copies of the periodical The Christian Science Monitor . While making the Paper House, he mixed his own glue to put the paper together. Ms Beaudoin said: 'It was basically flour and water, but he would add little sticky substances like apple peels. 'It has really lasted. The furniture is usable, and quite heavy.' All of the furniture in the house is made from paper, including the grandfather clock and piano. Inside . the clock is a paper from each one of the 48 states in it, so there are . all the state capitals and you can read them all the way down the front . of the clock. As it was made in the 1930s, the only two papers missing are those for Alaska and Hawaii. Home sweet home: Mechanical engineer Elis F. Stenman lived in his Paper House in the summer from 1924 to 1930 . 'This is a small town,' said Ms Beaudoin. 'Word got around that this man was making a house out of paper. 'I still feel responsible for it, but I don't worry about it. 'It's been here since 1924, so I guess if a storm was going to blow it over, then so be it. 'Here it sits and you can't spend your life worrying that something is going to happen to it. You just take care of it and that's it. 'When most people hear about the Paper House, they just ask, ""why?"" 'I don't really know the answer. I don't really know why unless he was just really thrifty or something.

Marmite's  controversial ‘animal cruelty’ commercial will not be investigated by the advertising watchdog despite it receiving more than 500 complaints. The documentary-style spoof which featured a welfare crew rescuing abandoned jars of Marmite was first screened earlier this month. It drew 504 complaints from viewers who said it trivialised the work of child and animal welfare agencies. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Controversy: Marmite has triggered a 'hate it' backlash with a commercial that mimics animal cruelty TV documentaries . The complaints led to Marmite’s owner Unilever donating £18,000 to the RSPCA. But the Advertising Standards Authority said: ‘Most [viewers] would recognise the ads were a spoof. ‘They... did not trivialise issues of abuse or denigrate the work of child and animal protection services.’ One . man is apparently left crying on his doorstep, while the faces of some . children are pixilated to protect their identity – as happens with . genuine documentaries. The premise is that these owners have neglected their Marmite which are then rescued by the pseudo RSPCA inspectors before the jars are re-homed. The manufacturer, which trades on the marketing slogan ‘Like It, Hate It, Just Don’t Forget It’, appears to have misjudged the response of viewers. Uniformed inspectors are seen raiding homes and shaming families to an emotive soundtrack from the BBC's much respected journalist and presenter Michael Buerk . The premise is that these owners have neglected their Marmite which are then rescued by the pseudo RSPCA inspectors before the jars are re-homed . Many animal welfare campaigners have hit back against the advert which they say makes a mockery of child cruelty . After the commercial was seen during a . break in Coronation Street on ITV on Monday night, the brand’s Facebook . and YouTube page were hit with a critical backlash. Among . the many Facebook complaints, one read: ‘Your new advert is very bad . taste. Animal abuse is no laughing matter and I think it’s very wrong to . jokingly use such a subject as a marketing scheme to increase your . sales. ‘People would be more inclined to buy Marmite if you donated a tiny percentage of each jars sale to the RSPCA to show that you meant no disrespect to the hard work that it does.‘ . Another wrote: ‘What on earth were you thinking?! Poor taste, at best.’ While a third added: ‘Disgraceful advert! The implications are dreadful and shame on Michael Buerk for taking part! Hope you take this off air straight away!!!!’ The commercial was seen during a break in Coronation Street on ITV on Monday night . However, the critics were matched by a . deluge of positive comments from fans who enjoyed the humour and . defended what they insisted was a funny message. Marmite apologised to those shoppers who were offended on its website, saying: ‘Sorry you feel that way.’ The manufacturer trades on the marketing slogan 'Like It, Hate It' It added: ‘The plot focuses on a fictitious world where teams of people are dedicated to salvaging unused jars and giving them to people who actually eat Marmite with the only animal that appears being a much-loved family pet. ‘We worked really hard to create an ad that we hoped people would watch in the light-hearted way it was intended.’ The RSPCA said it understood the concerns of some viewers. A spokesman said: ‘We understand that animal lovers are concerned on our behalf - people either love the advert or hate it. 'We plan to talk to the makers of Marmite about how we can work together on animal welfare.’ A spokesman for Unilever, which makes the spread, said: ‘It is never our intention to cause offence. This is the first time Marmite has been on television for two years and we have made every effort to ensure that this commercial entertains anyone who watches it. ‘It ranked highly throughout our rigorous testing process and with clear branding from the outset, as well as the comedic tone, we believe we have created an unmistakably Marmite ad – people will either love it or hate it and they certainly won’t forget it.

The first thought of many a man eager to bring a smile to the face of the woman in his life would be to present her with a box of chocolates. But in 1933 chocolate assortments were the preserve of the rich - sold encased in elaborate hand-carved boxes and costing the equivalent of up to £300 in today's money. That is until Rowntree's launched its now iconic Black Magic brand, bringing all the luxury and indulgence of a box of chocolates to the masses for a mere 14p in old currency - and saving the ailing confectioner in the process. Bringing chocolate boxes to the masses: Rowntree's advertising campaign for its Black Magic chocolates - including this 1934 poster - featured young society ladies . Launched in 1933 as Rowntree's was on the brink of bankruptcy, these archive posters - released to mark Black Magic's 80th anniversary - reveal the groundbreaking advertising campaign employed by the firm as it gambled its future on the budget box of chocolates. The adverts featured glamorous ladies and excerpts from their effusive thank you letters written to the sender of the gift, then priced at two shillings and ten pence per lb - around £5 in modern money. Those thank you letters, which continued to feature in Black Magic adverts for decades to come, became almost as iconic a part of the brand as the simple, no-frills black box. Black Magic: The groundbreaking advertising campaign pitched the affordable box of chocolates as the idea token from a father to his daughter . 1935 advert: It was the first time Rowntree's had every carried out market research on a product - surveying thousands of people for their views on the assortment . 'Universal appeal': The iconic Black Magic box is familiar even in this advertisement, created more than 70 years ago in 1937 . Production: This photograph shows women in a Rowntree's factory putting together boxes of Black Magic chocolates in 1950 . 'Rapturous': Letters from recipients of Black Magic boxes in which they extoll the virtues of the chocolate assortment became a key part of its famous branding . The hit brand was the brainchild of . marketing man George Harris, who began working for Rowntree's after . marrying into the family. Lucky recipients of box of Black Magic in the 1930s could take their pick from orange fondant, hazelnut cluster, montelimar, or cherry cup - not forgetting classic dark chocolates with marzipan, strawberry or caramel fillings. Fast-forward to 2013, and the orange fondant and caramel treats remain, alongside 'reinvented classics' like almond crunch - finely chopped almonds and truffle encased in dark chocolate - dreamy fudge, and a whole hazelnut praline in a dark chocolate shell. He . spearheaded the first ever market research carried out by the . confectioner, interviewing 9,500 people before deciding which flavours . should be included in the dark chocolate assortment. Only . then did the manufacturer settle on the popular combination . incorporating orange fondant, hazelnut cluster, and marzipan, caramel . and strawberry fillings. Alex . Hutchinson, archive curator at Nestle, which took over Rowntree's in 1988, . said: 'The Rowntree's business had been through shaky times before Black . Magic was invented. 'In . 1921 the business made a 33 per cent loss and in the late 1920s it was . still struggling and they had to lay a lot of people off. 'In 1931 Rowntree's was worried they wouldn’t be able to pay out any dividends to their shareholders. 'George Harris married into the family and started working for Rowntree's and he came up with the idea that their chocolates should have their own strong brands like America. 'People were suspicious of the idea but created Black Magic, which was quite a gamble as it could have been their last chocolate. Seasons greetings: An advert for a festive Black Magic gift box from Christmas 1977 . 'Before then, whatever went into a box of chocolates was decided on by the directors of the business. It was the first time they had actually done market research. 'Up until this point most boxes of chocolates were incredibly expensive and were the kind of thing used when making a marriage proposal,' Mr Hutchinson explained. Romance: The iconic letter features in this Black Magic advert from the 1980s, half a century after the brand was first launched . Who knows the secret? By the 1980s Black Magic were a popular and affordable gift, but prior to their launch in the 1930s boxes of chocolates were extremely expensive . 'They would come in hand carved boxes that could cost around 100 shillings each, which was an awful lot considering a week’s rent in slums was 10 shillings,' he added. 'Initially they couldn’t afford to spend a lot on advertising Black Magic so the sales people sold the boxes to hotels in London before taking them to shops. 'Shopkeepers bought them up quickly when they were told this because they thought they were getting a posh product, the money was then spent on advertising.' 'In the adverts there are young society ladies confiding in one another in letters about receiving Black Magic. 'It was to encourage people to see that buying a box of chocolates was okay to do as part of an early courtship,' said Mr Hutchinson, adding that, before then, the expense of a box of chocolates meant such a gift was reserved for as rare an occasion as a marriage proposal. 'After the success of Black Magic, George Harris made other iconic brands such as Kit Kat, Aero, Smarties, Polo, and Dairy Box and the company was able to expand.'","At two shillings and ten pence per lb, Black Magic offered affordable luxury .

Mr Miliband¿s Treasury team, under shadow chancellor Ed Balls, will today cite a new YouGov poll which has found that 81 per cent believe that politicians who say household incomes have grown faster than price rises . Workers are on average earning £1,350 a year less in real terms than when David Cameron came to office in May 2010, figures show. Labour will try to revive Ed Miliband’s stumbling leadership with an assault on the rising cost of living under the Coalition. And they will publish a poll showing that 81 per cent of voters believe prices have grown quicker over the last year than their household incomes. They will contrast that with official figures showing that bonuses in financial services soared in April by 82 per cent compared to the year before as bankers delayed their bonuses to take advantage of the cut in the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p in the pound which came into effect that month. The media blitz comes amid growing concern among Labour MPs that Mr Miliband has let the Tories and Lib Dems set the political agenda over recent weeks. The Labour leader has gone on holiday to France and given up his mobile phone, so colleagues can only contact him through his wife Justine. Yesterday Labour MP Graham Stringer complained: ‘Labour’s shadow cabinet is almost invisible in repose when it’s an ideal time to attack ministers who are on the beach. It’s a huge mistake and it’s not good enough. We need to be energetic, not slumbering.’ The new line of attack on living standards is an admission that Labour’s previous economic attacks on the lack of growth are defunct now that the economy is recovering. Mr Miliband’s Treasury team, under shadow chancellor Ed Balls, will today cite a new YouGov poll which has found that 81 per cent believe that politicians who say household incomes have grown faster than price rises, as George Osborne claimed last month, are ‘out of touch’. The survey also found that 70 per cent believe recent improvements in the economy have not benefited middle and lower income families. Squeeze: How average weekly earnings have fallen in real terms since the coalition was formed in May 2010 . Cost of living: Inflation is still more than 2.5 per cent, compared to wage rises of around 1.5 per cent . Shadow Treasury minister Catherine McKinnell said: ‘Working people know they are worse off under the Tories as prices continue to rise faster than wages. 'Families have also seen their tax credits and childcare support stripped back while David Cameron has prioritised a tax cut for millionaires. ‘The overwhelming majority of people rightly think that Ministers like George Osborne, who claim that families are better off, are totally out of touch. This may feel like a recovery for those at the top, but for everyone else life is getting harder.’ She spoke out as a Survation poll found 53 per cent of Labour supporters agreed Miliband is ‘hesitant.’ Narly half, 48 per cent said he is ‘trying to find himself’, 45 per cent called him ‘lacklustre’ and 37 per cent ‘confused.’ In a further challenge to Mr Miliband’s authority, Mr Miliband has been summoned to crisis talks with the 15 unions who give money to Labour over his reforms to the relationship between party and paymasters.

But the plan, which will end the automatic payment of fees from unions to Labour, has been dismissed as ‘gamble’ that will leave Labour’s finances in ‘mayhem’. Ian Lavery, who chairs the trade union group of Labour MPs, said he believed fewer than 15 per cent of union members would opt to join Labour under the changes, costing the party at least £9 million. ‘It will create mayhem for the party’s finances. We should have avoided that at all costs. ‘This is the biggest political gamble in the history of the Labour Party. It has been described as a challenge - it’s not. It’s a gamble. People are not queuing up to join Labour - quite the opposite. They are waiting to see what the party will bring to the table in its manifesto. Damian McBride, Gordon Brown’s former spin doctor, also called for more aggression from Mr Miliband, saying he should emulate the pugnacious American General George S. Patton from the Second World War. ‘Ed Miliband could do with a bit more General Patton in him. Yes he’s been tough enough to challenge his brother, to cut his ties with Gordon Brown and now to take on Len McCluskey and the unions.

'I didn't really need . braces but I wanted them because they look good and because Niall had . them.' Natasha, a sweet-faced girl of 17 from London, is a 'Directioner', which means like millions of other teenagers, she lives and breathes boyband One Direction. But while teenage fandom is nothing new, the Directioners' love for  Zayn Malik, 20, Harry Styles, Liam Payne and Niall Horan, all 19, and Louis Tomlinson, 21, goes beyond anything previously seen. Scroll down for video . Fan: When she's not thinking about Zayn Malik, Natasha, 17, cares for her disabled mother and younger brother . Leading man: Bradford's Zayn Malik, 21, is Natasha's favourite member of One Direction . Thanks to Twitter, One Direction superfans know what Harry ate for breakfast, where Zayn bought his shoes, or where Niall's sleeping on any given night - and they aren't afraid to show it. And as British GQ discovered when it straplined a Harry Styles cover with the words He's Up All Night To Get Lucky, they aren't above sending eye-opening abuse to anyone who they believe has traduced their idols. 'GO PUNCH THOSE SL*** AT GQ AND ALL THEIR BS ABOUT YOU ALL UNACCEPTABLE HARRY THEY TALK S*** ABOUT Y'ALL,' read one. Another Directioner tweeted: 'I'll f*** you up GQ, I swear you've messed with the wrong people'. So who are these extreme fans and what makes them go to such lengths to defend - and be noticed by - their idols? Those are just some of the questions director Daisy Asquith attempts to answer in new Channel 4 documentary, Crazy About One Direction. Among them is Natasha, a pretty girl with long dark hair who spends her spare time getting misty-eyed about Zayn Malik - and the rest caring for a disabled mother and younger brother. It's hard not to warm to Natasha and harder still not to feel a pang of sympathy when she says: 'I would do literally anything to be with . Zayn. They're like my identity so I'll love them forever. 'When you feel . shy and you feel scared and that, when you divert your mind to One . Direction, you just feel happy inside.' Popular: Despite only managing second place on the X-Factor, One Direction are the planet's biggest band . Not so lucky: GQ's Twitter account was subjected to a barrage of abuse thanks to its One Direction cover . You sympathise again when she waits for hours outside a press conference only for the band to zoom past with barely a wave to acknowledge her. Heartbreakingly, it's probably the closest she'll ever come to them. For Natasha, finding £40 or more for a concert ticket is an impossible dream. At the same time though, you're left with a sneaking sympathy for the boys themselves, who despite the millions in the bank and the adulation, deal with daily intrusion on a massive scale. One scene shows 19-year-old Becky from Manchester giggling as she runs through a hotel in search of the band. 'Zayn! Zayn just ran away from me,' she giggles tearfully into her iPhone moments later. In the end, Becky and her friends do get to meet the band, albeit after waiting all night. But while Becky's activities are . pretty harmless, if pretty irksome for the band members themselves, others take . their love for the band to bizarre and even sinister levels. 'I'd . rather not be best friends with them . because of all the girls who would tell you to die and I wouldn't like . that,' says Becky in a later scene, referring to the abuse directed at anyone suspected of harbouring a romantic attachment . to any of the boys. Excitable: One Direction are met by crowds of tearful, screaming fans wherever they go . Teen idols: The much-admired quintet on the set of their hit song What Makes You Beautiful . Bizarre: Speculation on Harry and Louis' relationship - or lack thereof - is accompanied by fan art such as this . Cara Delevingne, Caroline Flack and Taylor Swift are just some of the women who've endured a barrage of ire from Directioners - to the point, in Swift's case, they left Twitter altogether. Then, there's the popular Directioner pastime of 'shipping Larry' - speculating about the 'bromance, romance or just a nice friendship' between band members Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson. Dubbed 'Larry Stylinson' by fans, conjecture about the boys' relationship - or lack thereof - is accompanied by toe-curling fan fiction and carefully drawn images detailing the 'proposal' and the twosome curled with a baby between them. But not everyone is a fan of 'shipping Larry', it seems. 'It makes me mad because it's upsetting the boys,' says one Directioner. Becky adds: 'Some fans want them to be gay so they can't have a girlfriend.' Ultimately, being a Directioner is largely harmless and often fun, and allows fans the comforting sense of being part of something, of belonging, as Natasha so clearly feels. 'When you have all these other girls who . love One Direction, are mentally married to them, you feel part of this . gang,' she says. 'I'm part of being a Directioner... It's like a cult or a sect or . something.' A religion with Harry Styles at its heart? Taylor Swift ('I want to kill her for what she did to Harry,' says one girl) is probably quaking in her cowboy boots at the thought.

Every child’s first word is special, but when Finn Johnson called out 'mam' it was a momentous milestone. Because just 14 months ago, the youngster was unable to hear or speak and preparing to have an operation which would give Finn the gift of hearing and speech. He and his parents travelled to Italy where he underwent a pioneering brainstem implant, becoming what was believed to be then the youngest person to have the treatment in the world. Finn pictured playing at home with his parents Natalie and Nathan . Within a month of the surgery, the youngster was able to hear his parents’ voice for the first time and he has now spoken his first word. His grateful mother Natalie Nixon, 24, said: 'Finn is doing really well now. He’s just said his first word ‘Mam’ and we’ve videoed it! It’s wonderful.' Finn was born in January 2011, and was quickly diagnosed as being profoundly deaf. Brain scans revealed he lacked important hearing and balance nerves. Finn is thought to be the youngest person in the world to have pioneering brainstem implant surgery . He was diagnosed at Middlesbrough’s James Cook University Hospital with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder - which means his hearing organ, hearing nerve and brain are not synched together, so any hearing is distorted or absent. The family found the only chance of an auditory brain stem surgery was in Italy and had to raise money to pay for the £40,000 operation. Thanks to the generosity of Teessiders and donors, the youngster from Hardwick underwent the surgery, but fundraising is continuing to pay for follow-up treatment. Finn, now two-and-a-half, attends Little Ladybirds Day Nursery in Stockton where staff and children held a charity event raising £1,000 for the ongoing Fight for Finn campaign. Natalie said: 'We’re so grateful for all the people who have contributed to his fund. We now intend to use funds to take Finn to the John Tracy Clinic in America - possibly next year, or the year after - for intensive speech therapy in their summer programme.' Dad Nathan Johnson, 25, added: 'Our family and supporters are so grateful for this continuing help.'' At the nursery, the children took part in different activities each day, including making and selling cakes and painting portraits of themselves to sell to their parents. Manager Catherine Mason said: 'Finn is a very popular boy who’s a delight to have at the nursery and we would like to thank all those who supported such a worthwhile cause.' Finn still needs more funds to cover therapy which is not covered on the NHS, after his private operation. Visit the website: www.thefightforfinn.co.uk . Making progress: Fundraising continues so Finn can go on an intensive speech therapy course in America next year . Around 1,000 people in the world have auditory brain stem implants, which were first used in humans in 1979. Only a handful of surgeons around the world perform the complex neurological procedure. It involves surgeons implanting a microchip into the patient's brain stem so they can recognise and process sound. The technology is similar to that of a cochlear implant - using electrical stimulation - the brain stem implant uses electrical impulses to stimulate the brain, rather than the cochlea. Most recipients of the implant only have an awareness of sound. It's described as being able to hear the beat, but not the melody. After being implanted, the device needs to be reprogrammed by specialists regularly as electrodes can overlap with other parts of the brain stem, causing tingling in other parts of the body.","Finn Johnson was born with no auditory or balance nerves between his brain and ear .

Visit: Then British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott spins a tracitional top called 'kongzhu' during a visit at Baijiazhuang Primary School in Beijing in 2006 . John Prescott has threatened Channel 4 with an injunction over a TV investigation probing his business links with China, it emerged yesterday. The Labour peer is allegedly embroiled in a furious row with the producers of a Dispatches documentary that examines his connections with the communist country. The Chinese Are Coming, which will be broadcast tonight, also looks into the Asian business interests of Lord Prescott’s son Johnathan. Since stepping down as an MP in 2010, the former deputy prime minister has visited China numerous times and has ties to the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges, a think tank set up by outgoing premier Wen Jiabao. The programme tells ‘the behind-the-scenes story of the Dalai Lama’s visit to Britain, and reveals details of how British politicians from the Highlands of Scotland to the heart of Westminster are influenced by the Chinese government’. It focuses on the commercial interests and economic power of China, including the lobbying activity of telecoms firm Huawei, whose UK activities are under investigation by MPs. The company has spent more than £90,000 over two years lobbying MPs and ministers. Earlier this year, Lord Prescott, 74, tweeted a picture of himself with his new Huawei smartphone. His son Johnathan, a property developer, has faced scrutiny in the past over links between his business and his father’s political responsibilities. When Lord Prescott was in government and living in his grace-and-favour apartment in Admiralty House, his son showed building contractors round the property. He denied business had been discussed. Such is Lord Prescott’s apparent loyalty to the regime in Beijing, that organisers of a business summit claim he pulled out of a meeting earlier this year because exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama – a fierce critic of China’s human rights record – was a major speaker. Lord Prescott has vigorously denied these claims, adding he had no contact with the Chinese Embassy over his decision to miss the conference. Since stepping down as an MP for Hull East, Lord Prescott has made regular trips to China. In June last year, he went to Beijing on a junket paid for by the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges. Weeks later, he visited Shanghai to be awarded an honorary degree from Ningbo University. Frequent visitor: A beaming John Prescott in Beijing in 2005 . Two months after that, in September, he visited one of the world’s fastest developing cities, Chongqing, to attend the opening of a hotel. The year before he met Bo Xilai, the disgraced former communist party chief of the city, whose wife Gu Kailai was convicted over the murder of British businessman, Neil Heywood. The meetings were arranged during a visit to Chongqing where Lord Prescott was billed as a speaker at a conference. He did not have to declare the trip in any register of interests because he was neither an MP or a peer at the time. Earlier this month Lord Prescott failed in his bid to become the Police Commissioner for Humberside. If he had won, he would have taken home an estimated £155,000 from taxpayers in salary and pension payouts. As of last night, the Dispatches programme was still in the process of being edited. When contacted by the Mail last night, Lord Prescott declined to comment. - Dispatches: The Chinese Are Coming is on Channel 4 tonight at 8pm.","Lord Prescott has threatened to take out an injunction against the Dispatches programme .

In the last year 34 per cent of people risked starting a fire by cooking after consuming more than two alcoholic drinks . The researchers claim that in the last year 34 per cent of people cooked after consuming more than two alcoholic drinks. They warn that these people risk falling asleep and leaving their oven on which could cause a fire. And it seems that celebrity chefs who are seen glugging glasses of wine while whipping up culinary delights might be partly to blame for the trend in drunken cooking. But it is professional workers who are the biggest offenders as they are less likely to visit a take away on their way back from a night out, and prefer to cook when they get home. The Direct Line home insurance research suggests that this is not the only drunken pursuit that Britons engage in. It revealed that one in ten people admit to gardening after hitting the bottle. TV chef Keith Floyd was well known for being fond of a drink while cooking - TV chefs are being blamed for the rise in drunken cooking as they are regularly seen glugging wine while cooking . This means that some are operating potentially dangerous machinery while over the legal drink drive limit. Paul Braithwaite, home insurance claims manager at Direct Line, said: ‘While people may think they are fine to fire up the fryer or trim the hedge after a couple of beers, they need to remember their ability to operate this equipment will be impaired after just a couple of alcoholic drinks. ‘People are putting themselves at increased risk of injury in the kitchen, or setting their home on fire if they fall asleep with the cooker on, after consuming alcohol.’","In the last year, 34 per cent of Britons cooked after drinking more than two alcoholic beverages .

Striking on May 3 - 14-years ago - outside Moore, the strongest winds ever recorded on Earth were registered as the massive twister barreled through at 318 mph. The huge F5 category tornado, which is classified as 'incredible,' caused $1.1billion in damage and in total caused the deaths of 44 people. Just like Monday's horrifying storm, the 1999 storm system developed at around 3.30pm. and touched down seven miles northeast of Medicine Park at 4.51pm. Scroll down for video . Comparison: Here are the paths of tornadoes over the years in the Moore, Oklahoma area, with the red line showing the May 3, 1999 Tornado Path. The blue line corresponds to the May 8, 2003 path and green refers to the May 20, 2013 path .

During the tornado, 8,000 homes were . damaged or destroyed and it caused $1.1billion in damage (adjusted for . inflation), making it the most expensive tornado in U.S. history, a . record since smashed by the 2011 Joplin tornado. The Joplin twister struck with almost the same intensity as Monday's storm. Both registered an F5 on the Fujita Scale, meaning they had sustained winds of more than 200 miles per hour. While a firm number of casualties from Monday's twister is yet to be established, it has the potential to be as deadly as . the Joplin tornadoes of April 2011, which killed more than 158 people.

Behind it are two tornadoes that struck over two horrific days in April 1936 in Tupelo, Mississippi and Gainesville, Georgia, killing 216 and 203 people, respectively. The 1999 Moore tornado prompted the National Weather Service to send out the first-ever Tornado Emergency, a severe weather message used only in extreme cases where a massive tornado is about to impact a densely-populated area. A tornado emergency was issued today before the two mile wide tornado struck the town of Moore. Because of the staggering wind speed recorded during the 1999 tornado Bridge Creek–Moore tornado, there was speculation that the Fujita Scale of measurement would be modified to include a F6 catergory for winds that exceeded 318 mph. Similarities: Comparison between the May 3rd, 1999 and May 20th, 2013 tornado paths . Damage: The 1999 Moore tornado resulted in the National Weather Service creating the first-ever Tornado Emergency, a severe weather message used only in extreme cases . However, it was decided that the damage caused by an EF5 tornado leaves little room for any higher or more severe category. The day after the outbreak, then President Bill Clinton issued a federal disaster declaration for Oklahoma and 1,600 people left homeless overnight of May 3 were put into emergency Red Cross shelters. While there have been no casualty figures just yet today's storms have the potential to be as deadly as the tragic Alabama tornadoes of April 2011 which killed over 158 people in Joplin. Before that the deadliest day of tornadoes nationwide since 310 people lost their lives on April 3, 1974. The tri-state tornado remains the deadliest in U.S. history. It crossed from southeastern Missouri, through southern Illinois and then into southwestern Indiana. The tornado carried sheets of iron as far as 50miles away and obliterated entire towns and injured more than 2,000 people. The tornado outbreak over two days caused millions of dollars’ worth of damage across the region. The Tupelo tornado destroyed more than 200 homes, sweeping many into Gum Pond along with the residents. It killed whole families, including one of 13. The following day the Gainesville tornado - a double tornado event - emerged. It destroyed the Cooper Pants Factory, killing 70 workers - the highest tornado death toll from a single building in U.S. history. The Woodward tornado is the most deadly to ever strike the state of Oklahoma. It was almost two miles wide and traveled for 100 miles at speeds of up to 50 miles per hour. More than 100 blocks in Woodward were levelled and over 1,000 homes and businesses destroyed. The one-mile wide tornado was the third to strike the town of Joplin since 1971. More than 1,000 people were injured and almost $3billion worth of damage was caused. Local media reported that more than half of the 158 who died were killed inside their homes. Most of the people killed were in rural areas. Many historians believe the death toll was higher than official records state as many the deaths of many African-American may not have been properly recorded. Both the Amite and Purvis tornadoes were rated as F4 - the second strongest possible - and injured hundreds of people. It is the deadliest tornado to strike Michigan and injured more than 800 people. The Flint tornado, which traveled at speeds of 35mph, is rated as a F5 on the Fujita scale - the strongest possible. Of the 116 people killed, all but three died on a four-mile stretch of Coldwater Road. The Waco tornado killed 22 people as it destroyed the packed Dennis Building and a 12 died in cars crushed in the street. Almost 200 businesses and factories were destroyed, causing $41.2million worth of damage. The deadly tornado spurred the development of a nationwide severe weather warnings system. The tornado leveled churches, as well as more than 200 homes and businesses. Of those killed, 50 people died as they sought shelter in a black Methodist church in Goliad. The tornado struck on Easter Sunday at about 6pm, with little or no warning.

The U.S. military is preparing for a long-range missile attack on Syrian government targets, it was claimed today. The revelation comes as evidence piles up that the murderous regime of Bashar al-Assad was behind the suspected chemical weapons attack Wednesday that killed an estimated 1,500 Syrians in a Damascus suburb. The preparation for a military strike could mean that President Barack Obama intends to make good on his threat of 'enormous consequences' if Assad crossed the 'red line' of using chemical weapons against his own people. Warning: Graphic images . Ship-launched cruise missiles have a range of up to 1,500 miles - more than enough to reach Syrian government targets . Dozens of children appear among the dead bodies piled up in Ghouta, Syria. These victims, who appear to bear no physical injuries, were killed by a nerve gas attack launched by the Syrian government, rebels say . The Syrian rebels have worked to send pictures of the hundreds of dead across the world in an attempt to spur a military response and help them oust Bashar al-Assad from power . CBS News reports that 'The Pentagon is making initial preparations for a missile attack on Syrian government forces.' Commanders of the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean ordered warships to move closer to Israel, so they would be in better striking range to hit forces in Syria. The maximum range for Tomahawk Cruise Missiles is about 1,500 miles. Possible targets include command bunkers and missile sites that could be used to launch chemical-tipped missiles. Chairman . of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey is expect to present the . plan for a missile strike to Obama at a national security meeting on . Saturday. CBS News points out that the missile strikes would likely be more tactical than strategic. They are unlikely to topple, or even significantly destabilize Assad's regime. Serious decisions: President Barack Obama said that he will be taking action over the attack on Wednesday where chemical weapons were used . Defiant: President Bashar al-Assad has denied that his government used chemical weapons and blamed the attack on rebel forces . Instead, . U.S. generals are hoping that such an attack could send a message to . Assad - and also thwart future chemical weapons attacks. Still, . the president played down the likelihood of a unilateral attack on . Syrian government forces and seemed reticent to use military force. 'If the U.S. goes in and attacks another country without a U.N. mandate and without clear evidence that can be presented, then there are questions in terms of whether international law supports it - ""do we have the coalition to make it work?""' he told CNN in an interview broadcast Friday. United Nations Security Council backing for a strike on Assad seems unlikely. Russia, which has veto power, is a staunch supporter of the Syrian government and has blocked any decisive action against Assad thus far. CBS News also reported U.S. intelligence assets detected activity at known Syrian chemical weapons facilities before the attack Wednesday. On Friday National Security Adviser Susan Rice tweeted that the mass casualties in Damascus were an 'apparent chemical weapons attack.' 'What is Bashar al Assad hiding? The world is demanding an independent investigation of Wednesday’s apparent CW attack. Immediately,' she wrote. The Syrian regime has strongly denied that it has used chemical weapons, however the regime refuses to allow United Nations inspectors into the country to examine to site and confirm whether chemical weapons were used.","U.S. Sixth Fleet moved missile destroyers closer to Israel to put them in position for attack .

President Barack Obama says the possible chemical weapons attack in Syria this week is a 'big event of grave concern' that has hastened the timeframe for determining a U.S. response. 'This is something that is going to require America's attention,' Obama said during an interview broadcast Friday. Obama's comments on Syria were his first since Wednesday's alleged chemical weapons attack on the eastern suburbs of Damascus that killed at least 100 people. While he appeared to signal some greater urgency for a U.S. response, his comments were largely in line with his previous statements throughout the two-year conflict. The president said the notion that the U.S. alone can end Syria's bloody civil war is 'overstated' and made clear he would seek international support before taking large-scale action. Serious decisions: President Barack Obama said that he will be taking action over the attack on Wednesday where chemical weapons were used . 'If the U.S. goes in and attacks . another country without a U.N. mandate and without clear evidence that . can be presented, then there are questions in terms of whether . international law supports it, do we have the coalition to make it . work,' he said in the interview on CNN's 'New Day' show. The president said the U.S. is still seeking conclusive evidence that chemical weapons were used this week. Such . actions, he said, would be troubling and detrimental to 'some core . national interests that the United States has, both in terms of us . making sure that weapons of mass destruction are not proliferating, as . well as needing to protect our allies, our bases in the region.' Wednesday's . attack came as a United Nations team was on the ground in Syria . investigating earlier chemical weapons use. Obama has warned that . deployment of the deadly gases would cross a 'red line,' but the U.S. response to the confirmed attacks earlier this year has been minimal. Grim toll: The fighting in Syria's bloody two-year civil war has killed an estimated 100,000 people so far . Parents weep as they look for their children among the dead: Syria's government denies launching the latest attack on Wednesday and pictures show that some victims had foam coming from their mouths . More . than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria during more than two . years of clashes between forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad . and opposition fighters seeking to overthrow his regime. The . U.S. has long called for Assad to go and has sent humanitarian aid to . the rebels, but those steps have failed to push the Syrian leader from . power. Obama addressed the . deepening crisis in Syria from central New York, where he is on a . two-day bus tour promoting policies to make college more affordable. His interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo covered a wide range of topics, including America's changing stance on Egypt. 'The . aid itself may not reverse what the interim government does but I think . that what most Americans would say is that we have to be very careful . about what would be seen as aiding and abetting actions that we think . run contrary to our values and ideals,' he said. 'There's . no doubt that we can't return to business as usual given what's . happened,' he said referring to the recent attacks on civilians that . left hundreds dead. 'There . was a space right after Mr Morsi was removed in which we did a lot of . heavy lifting and a lot of diplomatic work to try to encourage the . military to move in a path of reconciliation- they did not take that . opportunity.' Turning his attention to domestic issues- both within the United States and the White House. Pointed: The President is currently touring upstate New York and giving a number of speeches related to the rising cost of college tuition (seen here in Buffalo on Thursday) Important siblings: Hours before being interviewed by CNN's Chris Cuomo, he spoke with his brother Andrew Cuomo who is the governor of New York . He . said that he is concerned about the safeguards at the NSA that led to . more Americans' emails being read than legally allowed. 'People . are still concerned as to whether their emails are being read or if . their phone calls are being listened to,' the President said. Documents released this week showed the National Security Agency may have unintentionally collected as many as 56,000 emails of Americans per year between 2008 and 2011. A secret U.S. court subsequently said the program may have violated U.S. law. The revelations led to new questions about operations by the eavesdropping NSA and its oversight by the secret U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC). Obama said the discovery of the mistake and the court's demand that safeguards be improved showed the system of oversight had functioned appropriately. 'All these safeguards, checks, audits, oversight worked,' he said in the interview on CNN's 'New Day' program. Obama said he was confident the NSA was not abusing its powers. 'What I recognize is that we're going to have to continue to improve the safeguards and, as technology moves forward, that means that we may be able to build technologies that give people more assurance, and we do have to do a better job of giving people confidence in how these programs work,' he said. New addition: President Obama said that Sunny (right) is faster, friskier, and a better jumper than Bo (left) The . lightest topic of conversation was the new family dog, Sunny, and . President Obama told how Bo was getting lonely now that his daughters- . who he referred to as the 'two other puppies'- have grown up. '(Sasha . and Malia) still have some responsibilities for him but they're not . always around between school, sports practice, all that stuff, so Bo was . starting to look a little down in the dumps,' he said. 'The truth is (Sunny's) faster than he is, she jumps higher, she's friskier- and he is trying to keep up. 'Right . now Michelle is in full parenting mode and really focused on getting .

A cousin of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez pleaded not guilty today to a contempt charge for allegedly refusing to testify before the grand jury that indicted Hernandez in the murder of a friend. Tanya Singleton entered her plea on a criminal contempt charge during a brief court appearance in Fall River, Massachusetts. Her attorney, E. Peter Parker, did not seek bail for her, agreeing that she be held until a hearing on October 3. Tanya Singleton, a cousin of former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez, is escorted into Superior Court in Fall River, Mass. today . Singleton was offered immunity but refused to testify before the grand jury, District Attorney Samuel Sutter said. She has been held since August 1 in a Suffolk County jail and was indicted Thursday. The grand jury on Thursday indicted Hernandez on first-degree murder and weapons charges in the death of 27-year-old Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional football player from Boston who was dating the sister of Hernandez's girlfriend. Lloyd's body was found June 17 in an industrial park in North Attleborough, about a mile from Hernandez's home. He had been shot five times. Tanya (pictured left in court today) pleaded not guilty on a contempt charge for allegedly refusing to testify before the grand jury that indicted Hernandez of murder . Hernandez, 23, pleaded not guilty to murder and weapons charges in district court in June, and he is being held without bail. One of his attorneys, Michael Fee, said yesterday that there had been an 'incredible rush to judgment' in the case and that he doesn't believe the state will be able to prove the charges during a jury trial. Prosecutors say Hernandez orchestrated the killing because he was upset at Lloyd for talking to people Hernandez had problems with at a nightclub days earlier. They say two Hernandez associates, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, were with the ex-player at the time Lloyd was killed. In Fall River today, the judge held a closed hearing before Singleton's arraignment. Former New England Patriot football player Aaron Hernandez (pictured right), was lead into court in Attleboro, Mass. yesterday . Odin Lloyd (pictured) was found dead on June 17, 2013 in an industrial park in North Attleborough, Mass. Gregg Miliote, a spokesman for Sutter, declined to comment on the substance of the proceeding. He also would not comment on what information prosecutors had hoped to learn from Singleton in grand jury testimony. Parker had no comment outside the courthouse on the indictment. Asked how she's doing, he said: 'She's doing good.' In July, authorities seized a cellphone and credit and bank cards from Singleton, who is from Hernandez's hometown of Bristol, Connecticut. Court records show Ortiz told investigators he and Wallace drove to Bristol after Lloyd's killing and that he was dropped off at Singleton's house. Ortiz said he discussed Lloyd's killing with her. Authorities say Singleton later purchased a bus ticket for Wallace to travel to Miramar, Florida, where his parents live. Wallace was indicted yesterday on a charge of being an accessory to murder after the fact. He pleaded not guilty earlier in district court to the same charge. He was ordered held on $500,000 bail. Ortiz has not been indicted. He pleaded not guilty in district court to a weapons charge and is being held without bail. He has a court hearing Thursday. Hernandez (pictured in court yesterday) was indicted for the murder of Odin Lloyd, 27, a semi-professional football player and friend of Hernandez . Hernandez, who was dropped by the Patriots within hours of his arrest on June 26, could face life in prison without parole if convicted. But when he appeared briefly in Attleboro District Court yesterday for a previously scheduled probable-cause hearing he looked relaxed. Authorities have said they haven't found the murder weapon, which they believe was a .45-caliber Glock pistol, but warrants released earlier this month suggested Hernandez may have asked his fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, to dispose of it. Investigators did recover a magazine for .45-caliber bullets in Hernandez's Hummer as well as ammunition of the same caliber inside a condo he rented in Franklin, Massachusetts. Authorities also recovered a shell casing that matched those found at the homicide scene after tracking the rental car Hernandez was in the night Lloyd died. Since then, Boston police have asked police in Hernandez's hometown of Bristol, Connecticut for their help with the probe into Lloyd's homicide as well as a 2012 double homicide near a Boston nightclub. A Connecticut police lieutenant said authorities searched the home of Hernandez's uncle, seizing an SUV sought in the double killing that had been rented in Hernandez's name. Two men died in the July 2012 shooting in Boston's South End, with witnesses reporting that gunfire came from inside a gray SUV with Rhode Island tags. Boston police haven't reported any arrests in the deaths of Daniel Jorge Correia de Abreu, 29, and Safiro Teixeira Furtado, 28, and won't comment on whether Hernandez is a suspect. Hernandez is also facing civil litigation after a Connecticut man filed a lawsuit asserting the former player shot him in the face in February after they argued at a Miami strip club. Alexander Bradley, who says he lost an eye, told police at the time he didn't know who shot him.","Tanya Singleton pleaded not guilty to a contempt charge for refusing to testify in Hernandez's murder trial .

Overwhelmed by the random act of kindess, the woman - an Obstetrics and Gynecology resident - and her husband posted a picture of the Good Samaritan on reddit.com which has now reaped its own rewards. Grateful: Reddit user 'anitasanger' posted this picture of a homeless man who returned some of her stolen property days after it went missing .

The . thief had also rifled through the glovebox before fleeing, leaving the . screwdriver he or she used to break into the car on the vehicle's floorboard. But the woman, fearing she had lost everything, was stunned when she was contacted by a homeless man who found her important paperwork. He tracked her down because her name was written on most of the documents. 'This homeless man just found a bunch of my wife's stolen property strewn all over downtown Tulsa,' user anitasanger posted on reddit. 'He took the time to gather it all up in the rain and called us for retrieval. I just want to recognize him as an awesome human being.'

The couple said they were grateful for the rough sleeper's compassion and gave him a $15 cash reward - a sum which was roundly criticized by reddit users. 'I realize that $15 isn't much, and it may appear like we slighted the . guy. Yes we had some luxury items an ipad and an iphone that were . stolen.

Many of the users commented the couple should donate a substantial sum to Tulsa Day Center for the Homeless, a shelter for people who sleep rough where the man was known to frequent. Perhaps proving that karma exists, a number of people made small donations to the center, and posted the news to reddit. 'Donate guys.

A father who was sent to prison for 40 years after his nine-year-old daughter falsely accused him of raping her is hoping apologetic letters written by the girl will help secure his release. Navy veteran David Kelly, now 54, was found guilty of raping, sodomizing and sexually abusing his daughter Chaneya in their Newburgh, New York home in 1998. He remains at Green Haven Correctional Facility and is only eligible for parole in 2018. But now his daughter, who is 24, says the attack never happened - and that she lied because her drug-addict mother forced to beat her unless she said her father abused her. Chaneya, who has battled the courts to release her father ever since recanting her accusations the following year, penned a series of apologetic letters to him. 'Mistake': Chaneya Kelly, who is now 24, said she falsely accused her Navy veteran father of raping her as a nine-year-old because her mother threatened to beat her if she didn't . Battle: David Kelly, pictured in prison, may use apologetic letters written by his daughter to secure his release . 'I didn’t want to get beat so I made up a lie that I'd take back anyday. I regret everything I said,' she said in one letter from 2002, which has been seen by the New York Post. 'It's just that I didn't want to get beaten by a ""drunken"" mother.' She added that she should be the one serving a lengthy sentence, rather than her father. 'I feel guilty when I talk about it. I feel that I should be in prison instead of you,' she wrote. In another letter from October 2006, which is signed 'Daddy's Big Girl', Chaneya said she wished she 'could change the past'. Mr Kelly's case is now under a full . review, but if this fails to clear his name, his attorney Peter Cross said . he will use the letters for an appeal. Family: Chaneya, pictured as a child, accused him of rape after her mother threatened to beat her if she did not . Speaking to NBC News, Chaneya said: 'I'm 24-years-old and I made this mistake when I was nine-years-old - but it's never too late to try and right your wrong.' Her father was barred from any contact with his children after being convicted by a jury of multiple counts of rape and serious sexual assault. Kelly, who has always maintained his innocence, had never been convicted of a felony before. 'All I think is, one day the truth will set me free. All I have to do is hold on,' Kelly told NBC News. In October 1997, while Kelly was living with his wife Charade and their five children in Newburgh, he says he was attempting to rid himself of a drug habit in order to take better care of his family. But he said his wife's own drug habit had spiraled to the point where she turned to prostitution in order to feed her addiction. Denial: His conviction remained even though she recanted her statement on video the following year (pictured) after her grandmother, right, took her to authorities. A judge said the recantation seemed forced . Chaneya, the Kellys' eldest child, says that one morning before school her mother asked her whether her father had ever 'touched' her. 'I was like, ""What do you mean, did he touch me?"" And she was like, ""Did he touch you in your no-no spot?"" And I would repeatedly say no,' the now 24-year-old said. According to Ms Kelly her mother threatened to beat her if she did not 'tell me the answer that I want to hear'. She said she told her mother her father had molested her to avoid being beaten, even though it wasn't true. Kelly was taken in for questioning on . October 29 1997. There was no definitive forensic evidence to prove . Chaneya had been raped, but the little girl and her mother's story - . together with some suspect answers Kelly provided during questioning - . were enough for officers to charge the father of five. He . refused a plea deal that would have made him eligible for parole in six . years, and within a year was sentenced to up to 40 years following a . trial by jury. Old life: Her mother Charade (pictured) said she was in the grip of drugs when she made the claims . His daughter was sent to live with her grandmother, a Pentecostal minister, and six months later Chaneya told her grandmother her father had never raped her. Pat Thomas took her granddaughter to Kelly's attorney who videotaped the child's recantation. Her mother, Charade, also submitted a sworn affidavit to the court which said she threatened to beat her daughter until she said her father raped her. A judge refused to vacate Kelly's conviction, deciding the recantation appeared forced. Kelly, who remains in jail to this day, began studying law and has filed multiple appeals. His daughter visited him in prison when she persuaded the courts to allow her to have contact with him at the age of 15. 'The first thing my dad did was that he . hugged me and he told me that he loved me and... that he doesn’t blame . me for anything,' she said. Wrongful conviction? Chaneya's father Daryl Kelly as spent almost 16 years in jail for molesting her - a crime his daughter now says never occurred . Appeals: Chaneya persuaded the courts to allow her to have contact with her father again when she was 15-years-old . Chaneya's mother has said she is now drug-free and confirms her daughter's story, blaming a drug binge for her threats. Frank Phillips, the Orange County District Attorney and chief prosecutor when Daryl Kelly stood trial, has emphasized that Kelly was found guilty by a jury. He said in an interview it was 'not unique' for the victim of a sexual crime to want to protect the abuser by withdrawing their accusation. Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick is leading a re-investigation into the Kelly case. His office and the detective behind the original police investigation in Newburgh both declined to comment.

Sarah Hershberger has leukemia and her parents brought her to Akron Children's Hospital in Ohio to treat the tumors on her kidney, neck and chest- a number of which were visible to the naked eye. Her parents Andy and Anna Hershberger initially said that she could be treated with the necessary chemotherapy and she underwent some rounds of the procedure but not enough to completely eradicate the cancer. They have since decided against it, saying that they want to use natural medicine like vitamins and herbs to solve the problem. Fighting: Akron Children's Hospital has already petitioned once to be granted guardianship of the girl but that initial request was rejected, and now they are re-applying to a different judge . The Medina Gazette reports that the hospital already applied to take over legal guardianship of Sarah but were rejected by one Ohio judge who has since retired. Hoping to help: The hospital's attorney Maria Schimer, who is also a registered nurse, would be granted the right to make Sarah Hershberger's medical decisions if the appeal is granted . 'The court cannot deprive these parents of their right to make medical decisions for their daughter because there is not a scintilla of evidence showing the parents are unfit,' Judge John Lohn wrote in his decision before retiring earlier this month. He added that the girl's parents were 'caring, attentive, protective and concerned'. It is unclear how long Sarah underwent chemotherapy, but apparently long enough for the visible tumors on her neck and chest to disappear, as court records say that they went away but she did not go into remission. 'Sarah begged her parents to stop the treatments. Anna said she and Andy could not stand to watch what was happening to their daughter,' Judge Lohn wrote. Sarah apparently complained about feeling sick and she didn't want to become infertile. Nausea, organ damage and infertility are all common side effects of chemotherapy, but in this case, doctors say that 'the question of Sarah's treatment is life and death'. Mrs Hershberger 'prayed for wisdom to discern God's plan for Sarah' and believed that the therapy was killing her. Traditions: Sarah Hershberger (who is not pictured) and her family are Amish, and their beliefs force them to shun technology and in turn, some forms of modern medicine . The hospital's attorney Maria Schimer, who is also a registered nurse, is now appealing the decision and hopes to be granted limited guardianship so that she is in charge of making medical decisions for Sarah. 'The plan presented by Sarah’s parents is almost certain to lead to Sarah’s death,' she wrote in a letter to the court. 'Every day that goes by without treatment, Sarah’s chance of surviving her cancer is diminished.' With chemotherapy, her chances of survival increase to 85 per cent.","Sarah Hershberger, 10, has leukemia and doctors say she will die unless she receives chemotherapy .

As the devastated Oklahoma City suburb of Moore begins to rebuild after Monday's epic storm, federal forecasters warned that as many as six more could be heading our way in the coming months, in the form of hurricanes. The National Weather Service gave an official warning on Thursday, predicting 13 to 20 named Atlantic storms this coming hurricane season, 7 to 11 that strengthen into hurricanes and 3 to 6 that become major hurricanes. Hurricanes and tornadoes are both wind storms, though the former tend to form over water while tornadoes or twisters generally form over land. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said there is a 70 per cent chance that this year will be more active than an average hurricane season - potentially bringing with it another Superstorm Sandy. 'This is your warning,' acting NOAA administrator Kathryn Sullivan said on Thursday to those living in hurricane prone areas along the Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Mexico coasts.

All the factors that go into hurricane forecasts are pointing to an active season, or extremely active one, said lead forecaster Gerry Bell of the Climate Prediction Center. Those factors include warmer than average ocean waters that provide fuel for storms, a multi-decade pattern of increased hurricane activity, the lack of an El Nino warming of the central Pacific Ocean, and an active pattern of storm systems coming off west Africa.

Pictures of a historic 13th century abbey have gone viral after eagle eyed photographers spotted that one of the gargoyles was the spitting image of the monster from the Alien films. A photograph of the gargoyle at Paisley Abbey near Glasgow has caused a media sensation with its likeness to the creature from the 1980s cult movie. Reverend Alan Birss from the abbey ended speculation that Ridley Scott had copied his creation from the abbey saying that most of the gargoyles were replaced during a refurbishment in the early 1990s. Scroll down for video . Uncanny: The resemblance between the gargoyles on the outside of the 13th century cathedral have caused a frenzy on social media . Gothic: Circled in red is the 'alien' gargoyle one of 12 that were restored during the early nineties . He believes that one of the stonemasons must have been having a bit of fun and made the figurine as a tribute to the film. Mr Birss told the BBC that 12 medieval gargoyles which had been on the abbey for hundreds of years but had to be taken down in 1991 because they had 'crumbled and were in a very bad state.' One the original gargoyles was sound enough to restore to its original form but the others were too decayed from hundreds of years spouting rainfall from the roof of the building and had to be scrapped completely. The original purpose of the grotesque figures was to take rain water away from the roof in the days before down pipes. Mr Birss said a stonemason from an Edinburgh firm was contracted to create the new gargoyles. During refurbishment in the early 1990's, Paisley Abbey's many gargoyles had to be taken down and replaced because they had crumbled and were in very bad condition . Fun: A stonemason from Edinburgh was recruited to design some gargoyles for the abbey . He said: 'I think it was a stonemason having a bit of fun. 'Perhaps the film was fairly new when they were carving this and if he was thinking of an alien perhaps the alien from the film was his idea of an alien. 'I'm sure he wasn't deliberately copying the alien in the film. It was just a concept of an alien.'Mr Birss said an internet search showed that someone had pointed out the similarity as far back as 1997. He added: 'But it obviously did not pick up and take off then like it has now.' Church officer Matthew McIntosh said: 'It is a beautiful building. Paisley gets a bad press but the abbey is the jewel in the crown. Although only one gargoyle looks as if it has escaped from an action movie the other new ones are equally terrifying . 'People will be surprised and delighted by everything they see outside and inside.' Alien enthusiasts from all over the UK took to Twitter to express their delight at the discovery. Richard Aird ‏ wrote: 'Brilliant! Gargoyle on Paisley Abbey found to be sculpted to resemble an alien from 'Aliens' movie.'

Survivor: Phil Woodbridge came through the potentially fatal accident unscathed thanks to his quick reactions and sturdy car . A 25-year-old man has survived a 40 tonne truck falling onto the roof of his car after it smashed into a bridge. Phil Woodbridge, of Stockport, Greater Manchester, swerved onto the pavement and escaped through his passenger door as the HGV landed on his roof directly above him in Brinnington. The sales manager was travelling to work by an unusual route because of the huge fire at the recycling plant nearby in Bredbury. Miraculously the roof of his Audi A3 - which he bought last month - only gave way slightly under the lorry’s weight and Phil was able to jump out of the passenger side uninjured. He said: 'It was a horrible situation. I heard the lorry hit something and it started to topple over, I dropped it into second gear to get some speed up and swerved onto the pavement. 'As it hit I ducked my head down and undid my seatbelt and jumped out as quick as I could. The whole thing was in slow motion. The instinct was to swerve and the car saved me. 'I only bought it four weeks ago, afterwards I just stood staring at it. If I’d stayed on the road I would have been crushed. It started to hit me that night when I began thinking about it. 'But I’ve not got a single mark on me. Hopefully I’ll get another Audi, the police said the picture of the lorry on it would be a great advert for them.' The lorry driver, a 34-year-old man, was also able to climb out of his cab, also uninjured after the crash on Thursday morning. Trains from Manchester Piccadilly to Sheffield were also delayed while the bridge was inspected and passed as safe. Firefighters were called to the accident at 10.50am.

George Zimmerman has emerged from hiding to promote the company that made the gun he used to kill Trayvon Martin. The first photo of the former neighborhood watch volunteer since he was acquitted of murder in July shows him smiling and shaking hands with an employee who works at Kel-Tec in Cocoa, Florida. Zimmerman and his lawyer stopped at the gun maker's headquarters to check out the high-capacity Kel-Tec KSG pump-action shotgun. TMZ.com reports that Zimmerman was interested in buying the weapon, though it is unclear whether he actually left with one. Scroll down for video . Shopping around: This is the first public image of George Zimmerman to emerge since his acquittal on murder charges. He poses here with an employee at the Kel Tec gun factory . In the market for a new gun: George Zimmerman was seen shopping for a high-tech shotgun at the headquarters of Kel-Tec arms . Making a statement: The Kel-Tec KSG holds up to 15 shotshells - nearly twice the capacity of traditional tractical-style shotguns . Kel-Tec is the same company that made the . PF-9 9mm pistol he used to shoot 17-year-old Trayvon last year. Zimmerman contended he killed the teen in self-defense after he . sustained a beating. TMZ reports that the son of Kel-Tec's owner personally gave Zimmerman a tour of the company in Coca, Florida, including a view of the manufacturing plant and showroom. Zimmerman and his lawyer, Mark O'Mara, were looking into the legality of buying a Kel-Tec KSG, a cutting edge weapon that has two magazines to hold shotgun shells, according to reports. He posed for at least one photograph with a worker at the plant. It is unknown whether he actually bought the weapon. The KSG can fire up to 15 12-gauge shotgun shells without re-loading, nearly twice the capacity of other tactical-style shotguns, which are usually converted hunting arms.The gun costs about $1,200. Shotguns like the KSG are primarily used for home defense. Shotshells fire multiple pellets at once that are meant to spread out. Zimmerman's 9mm pistol, also made by Kel Tec, was returned to him after he was acquitted of all charges in the death of Trayvon Martin . Controversy: Zimmerman says that supporters of slain teenager Trayvon Martin have sent his family thousands of death threats . They can be devastating at close range - and much more effective than the 9mm bullet fired by his handgun. Shotshells lose most of their effectiveness at ranges over 25 to 35 yards. Whereas Zimmerman's Kel-Tec pistol is small and concealable, the shotgun he examined is meant to make a statement. It emits an audible sound - familiar to any hunter or fan of zombie movies - whenever the action is cycled. Zimmerman, 29, has been a free man since he was acquitted of all charges July 13 in the shooting of unarmed Trayvon. The racially-charged case brought thousands of death threats to Zimmerman and his family. A fringe black panther group reportedly put a price on his head, as well. After his acquittal, police returned the pistol that killed Trayvon to Zimmerman. He was carrying it in his truck when he was pulled over in Texas less than two weeks later. The former neighborhood watch volunteer from Sanford, Florida, was forced to flee his home and has been in hiding ever since the case began receiving international attention. The KSG has two magazine tubes that can be loaded at the same time - giving the weapon a capacity of 15 12-gauge shotgun shells .","Zimmerman went to headquarters of Kel-Tec, the same company that made the pistol that killed Trayvon Martin .

Mother-of-six Lou Japp lost an eye and much of the left side of her face after she fell in the bath and contracted necrotising fasciitis. The 54-year-old, who almost died, could not go out in public without an eye patch and scarves covering her face - and even then children would recoil in terror. Lou Japp lost an eye and much of the left side of her face after she fell in the bath and contracted necrotising fasciitis. After the failure of dozens of surgical operations to reconstruct her ravaged features, doctors are now creating what is believed to be the first prosthetic face for a flesh-eating bug victim in Scotland . After the failure of dozens of surgical operations to reconstruct her ravaged features, doctors are now creating what is believed to be the first prosthetic face for a flesh-eating bug victim in Scotland. Mrs Japp, from Kelty, Fife, hopes the lifelike mask will allow her to live a normal life after five years of mental and physical pain. She fell and cut her face while getting out of the bath in July 2008 to answer a telephone call from a neighbour. The wound then became infected with necrotising fasciitis which spread rapidly. Surgeons removed much of her face to stop the bug spreading to the internal organs and killing her. Even then, she was placed in a coma and put on a ventilator for several days, watched over by her husband of 22 years, Robert, 58. Mrs Japp said that when she came round she was 'trapped in a nightmare'. She said: 'When they told me that I had lost half of my face I was devastated. Mrs Japp fell and cut her face while getting out of the bath to answer a telephone call. The wound became infected with necrotising fasciitis which spread rapidly and nearly killed her . Mrs Japp (left, before the incident) lost her hair, so began wearing hats and scarves around her head to cover up her scars (right) 'It just didn’t seem real, I couldn’t believe that this was happening to me. I was scared because I didn’t know what was going to happen.' She described the first time she looked into the mirror, after the life-altering procedure as 'shocking'. 'I didn’t recognise myself. I was devastated but I was just happy to be alive.' She added: 'I’d lost all my hair so I started to wear hats and wrap scarves around my head to cover up my scars so people wouldn’t notice. 'And I wore eye masks but they were dysfunctional and not comfortable, it didn’t feel feminine. 'Kids were scared and when I would walk to the shops people would stare at me and it felt uncomfortable. Mrs Japp, who raises money for charity by knitting, has undergone 30 operations but surgical reconstruction has now been ruled out. 'Over the last five years doctors have attempted to reconstruct my face surgically but it hasn’t worked,' she said. Now doctors are creating a prosthetic face for Mrs Japp (pictured with her husband Robert) that will finally give her a normal appearance. The sophisticated mask now halfway to completion and is attached every day using special glue . 'The plastic surgeon told me there’s no other surgical things we can try, we’d exhausted all options. The skin is so fragile it regularly tears under the stress of everyday life.' But doctors at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, are now creating a prosthetic face for her that will finally give her a normal appearance. The sophisticated mask is attached every day using special glue. Doctors plan to make the business easier by using magnets attached to her cheek bones and eye socket. The mask itself is made of medical-grade silicon, making it comfortable and lifelike in appearance. Doctors used Mrs Japp's intact right side to create a wax mould for the silicon. The vital finishing touches, which have yet to be added, include eyelashes, eyebrows, and an acrylic eye. The whole process is taking doctors 11 weeks to complete and Lou has seven still to go. She said: 'When I was told I could have a mask built to match the remaining side of my face I was over the moon. The mask itself is made of medical-grade silicon, making it comfortable and lifelike in appearance. Doctors used Mrs Japp's intact right side to create a wax mould for the silicon. The vital finishing touches, which have yet to be added, include eyelashes, eyebrows, and an acrylic eye . 'I can feel confident again and be social and continue with my life without people judging me and looking at me in a negative way.' 'I spend half an hour each morning glueing the mask onto my face, then using special make up to blend the mask in. 'I got a prescription for new wigs too so soon I’ll have a new face and be a new person and I absolutely can’t wait. 'My friends and family are as excited about it as I am, and we can all celebrate together when the mask is complete.' Dr Yvonne Moore, an expert in prosthetic facial reconstruction at Ninewells, is leading the team which is creating Lou’s new face. Dr Moore, who usually works with cancer patients and accident victims, confirmed: 'This is the first orbital prosthesis I have made for a survivor of necrotising fasciitis.' She added: 'We do it so they can go out and feel like people aren’t staring at them and they can have a social life...and to gain a sense of normality and gain confidence.'","Lou Japp, 54, lost an eye and much of the left side of her face after she fell in the bath and contracted necrotising fasciitis .

The chairman of the Housing Authority in Newington, Connecticut has implemented a new no smoking policy for adult residents similar to those implemented in many college dormitories. Only difference is those impacted by the new rule aren't 18-year-old co-eds - in one case, it's a 90-year-old World War II veteran who has been told he and his 90-year-old wife who has severe Alzheimer's Disease are being evicted from the apartment where they've lived for 20 years because he has been busted smoking cigarettes on a breezeway rather than in a designated picnic area away from the building. Andy Nowicki, who won a Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts during the war, was a combat infantryman fighting the Nazis in Africa, Italy, France and Germany. The Army is where he picked up his smoking habit 70 years ago, as Uncle Sam provided soldiers with free cigarettes during the war. War hero: Andy Nowicki enjoys a cigarette in front of the apartment he and his wife are about to be evicted from . Habit: Nowicki started smoking while fighting the Nazis. He says he's tried to quit but can't . Now that habit has cost him his home. 'It's like they're going to turn this into a concentration camp,' Nowicki told the Hartford Courant as he smoked a cigarette in his rolling chair that he had to wheel the appropriate distance from his apartment in a senior living center in Cedar Village. 'I don't know why they singled me out.' Janet Nowicki, Mr. Nowicki's daughter, has no idea where her parents will go if they are forced from their $714-a-month apartment - the couple lives on a small, fixed income. Additionally, Mr. Nowicki's wife, Leona, is in the very late stages of Alzheimer's - most of the time, she barely even recognizes her husband of nearly 70 years. Ms. Nowicki and Paul Doyle - a state senator who is acting as the Nowicki's attorney free of charge - are urging the Housing Authority to make an exception in Mr. Nowicki's case because of his age, immobility and war record. New Policy: the smoking restrictions were put in place at Cedar Village apartments in January 2012 . 'Personally, I couldn't sleep at night evicting a 90-year-old war hero from government-subsidized housing,' Doyle said. 'It's just totally incredible to me that we can't find an exception to the rules. I think common sense should prevail and let Mr. Nowicki live out his life because of what he did for all of us.' The town's mayor has even stepped in, also urging the Housing Authority to come up with some sort of compromise that would allow the Nowickis to stay in their apartment. However, the town has no control over the independent Housing Authority. 'I fully agree that you shouldn't smoke,' Newington Mayor Stephen Woods said, 'but the man is 90 years old. There's got to be some way to compromise so that he won't have to leave the home where he's been for 20 years. Every issue isn't black and white.' The Housing Authority doesn't seem to want to budge, though - Chairman Stephen Karp and Executive Director Melinda Harvey say that making an exception to the rule - implemented about 18 months ago - isn't going to happen. Compromise: State Senator Paul Doyle is acting as the Nowicki's attorney and hopes he can come to a compromise that allows the couple to stay in their home . 'Once you start that, where do you end that?' Karp said. 'We made a . decision that's in the best interests of the health and safety of the . tenants. We really feel there isn't room for making an exception on this . particular issue.' When asked about Mr. Nowicki's mobility issues, Harvey told the paper 'he has a walker and a scooter - he gets around the property pretty well.' Mr. Nowicki said he's tried quitting before, but simply can't. 'Are you kidding?' he said. 'I got the best doctor in the world. He gave me gum. He gave me the patch.' Elliot Lane is the attorney representing the Housing Authority when the Nowicki's case is heard on September 3. He said he expects a mediation session prior to the hearing. 'Can a compromise be reached?' Lane said. 'We're not in court yet. I'm looking forward to meeting with Sen. Doyle to see if we can find an agreement satisfactory to both parties.'","Andy Nowicki started smoking in the Army when the U.S. government gave him free cigarettes as he fought the Nazis in Europe and Africa .

The director of a new film has been forced into a grovelling apology after he sent out a promotional pack including a balaclava, nails and a roll of duct tape. The film, A Belfast Story, is about paramilitaries in Northern Ireland and is set in a post-Troubles Belfast which is still marred by violence. Starring Irish actor Colm Meaney the film is meant to the reality of modern Belfast. But film writers were horrified when they received the press pack full of unsavoury accessories leading Northern Irish writer Chris Hewitt, of Empire magazine, to brand it 'the most distasteful freebie ever.' A Belfast Story: The film is set in modern day Belfast which is shows as still marred by violence, pictured an attack by Nationalist groups in the Ardoyne area of Belfast in 2009 . In evident dismay Hewitt tweeted that he had received 'a box containing a bag of nails (for a nail bomb) and a balaclava, for A Belfast Story. Not quite sure what point whoever sent it is trying to make. But I'm pretty sure it's a moronic one.' The promotional boxes, which also feature fake newspaper clippings and surveillance photos, were sent to media outlets including Belfast’s UTV. The plot of the film, follows Meaney playing a weary detective tasked with investigating the murders of former paramilitaries. It was written and directed by Nathan Todd, a former engineering student at Queen's University, Belfast. Todd told the BBC that the purpose of the packs was not to frighten or offend people. In a conversation with the BBC Good Morning Ulster programme he said: 'The idea was to interest people in a movie we were making which is essentially the story of the two choices which face Belfast, do we engage retribution or reconciliation. 'Obviously, the intention is not to offend anyone. We apologise if we did. 'The intention is to raise awareness for something that we did, that delves into some legitimate questions and tells some interesting stories about the city and the country.' Dark days: But the press packs containing nails, balaclavas and duct tape were too close to home for some including Empire reporter Christ Hewitt . Split psyche Northern Ireland: The producers of the film say the pack was meant to represent the realist of modern Belfast . But whatever the justification for the stunt was many like Mr Hewitt no seem inclined to give the film exploring 'a life after terrorism' a miss. Mr Hewitt remains unimpressed by the apology and told the Independent: 'I’d like to sit down with whoever came up with that little brainwave and explain to them what growing up during The Troubles was like. 'I’m now not going to see it. There is such a thing as bad publicity.' Teri Kelly, a publicist for the movie, which opens next month, said the press kit had been sent out by the producers to represent the divisions that remain in Northern Ireland’s psyche. He said: 'It was sent out to show the two sides of the film, reconciliation and retribution. 'There are two sides to the box and one side represents retribution and violence and one side represents turning away from violence. It tries to show the dichotomy within Northern Ireland.' The press kit appears to be the most ludicrous promotional movie stunt since a Missouri cinema hired a gunman in full tactical gear to storm an Iron Man 3 screening in May. Terrified audience members called police, fearing they had stumbled into a repeat of the Colorado cinema shooting which left 12 dead during a premiere screening of The Dark Knight Rises last year.","Director Nathan Todd claims the contents of the press pack was to illustrate the division in modern Northern Irish society .

The Swedish wife of Silicon Valley real estate tycoon Clyde Berg was back on the stand Thursday to testify about the night her husband had allegedly raped her with a golf putter after she rushed out of the courtroom the day before. Ellena Berg, 37, stunned the San Jose court Wednesday when she refused to answer several questions about the alleged incident that took place last fall while the woman was nine months pregnant with a baby from a sperm donor. Mrs Berg has accused her 74-year-old millionaire husband of outfitting her with a spiked dog collar and a leash, chaining her to a bed for two days and sexually assaulting her with a golf club. Wife: Ellena Berg, 37, was found bloodied and bound in her San Jose home last year when she was nine-months pregnant and told police her elderly husband chained her to the bed . Armed . with notes and smelling salts to keep herself calm, the statuesque . blonde took the witness stand Thursday to address several issues that . have been raised by Clyde Berg's defense, namely, how she was able to . dial 911 with her hands restrained behind her back, and why she did not . call for help sooner. The . Swedish-born Ellena, who reportedly met the twice-divorced Clyde Berg a . decade ago while working as an au pair, said in court that after . enduring years of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her husband, . she has developed a habit for submissiveness, which could explain why . she offered no resistance when Mr Berg allegedly put a gun to her head . September 5, 2012. 'Mentally, physically, I wasn't there,' she said. 'It's a response system to fear and stress I learned very early,' the San Jose Mercury reported. It . was also her deep-seated submissiveness and fear of challenging . authority that kept her from trying to escape or summon help, according to Mrs Berg. After . initially refusing to answer questions about the 911 call, on Thursday . the woman finally offered an explanation, telling the court that she had . stashed a prepaid phone under the mattress sometime before the . September 2012 incident because her husband was known to take away her . possessions. After allegedly spending . two days chained to her bed and suffering abuse, Ellena Berg said she . finally summoned the courage to retrieve the hidden phone because she . feared her husband might kill her . ‘I decided I had to save my [unborn] daughter,’ Ellena Berg testified. Millionaire: Silicon Valley tycoon Clyde Berg, 74, accused of sexually abusing his third wife, attends a preliminary hearing at the Santa Clara County Hall of Justice in San Jose Tuesday . Berg . then went on to describe how she slid off the bed, got down into a . kneeling position on the floor and pushed her hands cuffed behind her . back under the mattress. Prompted . by prosecutor Alison Filo to explain how she managed to dial 911, . Ellena Berg haltingly said that she counted the keys on the phone, which . had raised buttons rather than a flat screen. The woman then dropped the device and pushed the 'send' button with her tongue, she recalled. Prior . to her testimony, Ellena Berg surprised those present in the Santa Clara County Hall of Justice by handing out copies of a letter she had written, in which she . complained about being treated in an unfair manner by everyone involved . in the case, even her own lawyer. Later . that day, Allen Ruby, Clyde Berg's attorney, got a chance to . cross-examine Mrs Berg, questioning her claim that her notoriously . tight-fisted husband, who once berated her for spending $15 at a car . wash, has agreed to a postnuptial contract, which called for the real . estate mogul to pay Ellena $2million in case of a divorce. Ruby . also cast doubt on Mrs Berg’s assertion that as part of the deal, . her husband has agreed to pay all the expenses incurred by her sperm . donor, a renowned California ballroom dancer. Details . of the alleged horrific incident emerged in court this week during . 74-year-old Clyde Berg's preliminary hearing on charges of corporal . injury of a spouse and sexual penetration by force. His . third wife was found bloodied and bound in the couple's San Jose home . last year when she was nine-months pregnant and told police her elderly . husband outfitted her with the leash and chained her to the bed while . sexually assaulting her with the golf club. She took the stand Wednesday at Santa Clara County Hall of Justice to present her version of events to a judge who must now decide if there is enough evidence to hold Berg over for trial. The real estate magnate - who is worth $200million - vehemently denies the charges and claims he's the victim of a scam to get around a restrictive prenuptial agreement. Family pet: Mrs Berg also has claimed that her estranged husband abused the couple's beloved Weimaraner named Rudy (pictured) He faces 15 years to life in prison, if convicted. During her Wednesday testimony, Ellena stunned the court by refusing to answer to key questions - one about a night in 2010 when she was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and how her two previous pregnancies ended. The San Jose Mercury News reported that when the 37-year-old said, 'I refuse to answer that', in response to one of the questions, the judge's eyes widened. Claims of innocence: The real estate magnate vehemently denies the abuse charges, contending that he's the victim of a scam . She then abruptly left the courtroom, leading the judge to suggest that Ellena might be 'disturbed' and 'paranoid.' The Swedish native has claimed in a 43-page civil suit that the incident capped off ten years of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her husband. The divorce papers state that Clyde Berg wielded his considerable power against her like 'a weapon of mass destruction' and claim she lived in virtual isolation 'as a slave' in fear of his unpredictable physical and sexual abuse. She said he made her drink out of a dog's water bowl and dunked her head in the toilet after she vomited from morning sickness. There have already been doubts raised about her account of what happened on the night of September 4 after gynecological reports that arguably show Ellena Berg did not sustain the degree of sexual abuse she claims and questions were raised as to how she was able to call 911 while her hands were cuffed behind her back. Clyde Berg is the brother and business partner of billionaire Carl Berg, one of the richest people in the United States. Ellena Berg has also obtained a restraining order against Clyde Berg and has custody of Rudy, the couple's beloved Weimaraner, whom she claimed was also abused by her estranged husband.","Real estate magnate Clyde Berg, 74, is worth $200million .

The . testimony marked a shift as prosecutors begin focusing on forensic . evidence. In the trial's first week, prosecutors ran through 60-plus . witnesses, many of them soldiers injured in the attack. It was also revealed today that Hasan told a mental health panel he wished to die . while carrying out 'jihad' because it would signal God had designated . him as a religious martyr. The . New York Times on Tuesday published an account of parts of the panel's . January 2011 report on Major Nidal Hasan, a 42-year-old U.S.-born Muslim . whose court-martial began at Fort Hood, Texas on August 6. The . newspaper also published an image online of the official report. Some . pages of the report were released by Hasan's former civilian lawyer, . John Galligan, the newspaper said. The . panel, known as a sanity board, was assembled to assess whether former . Army psychiatrist Hasan was able to stand trial. It concluded he was fit . for trial but the contents of the report have not been heard by the . jury of military officers. Closely guarded: An armed soldier stands guard at the court-martial of Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan on August 6 . Hasan told the court last week that he switched sides in what he called a U.S. war on Islam. He told the jury, 'I am the shooter' and he has not contested the testimony of more than 60 witnesses who described the November 5, 2009 shootings, the worst non-combat attack on a U.S. military base. The court-martial resumed on Tuesday with expert witness testimony about the crime scene. Hasan attends court in a wheelchair after being paralyzed from the waist down in a shootout with military police who ended his rampage. Hasan could face the death penalty by lethal injection if he is convicted. 'I'm paraplegic and could be in jail for the rest of my life,' Hasan told the panel of military mental health experts. 'However, if I died by lethal injection I would still be a martyr,' Hasan said. He also denied having remorse and considered his injuries a 'badge of honor,' according to the report. The terse, unapologetic statements help . explain tension between Hasan, who is defending himself, and a team of . standby lawyers assisting him who have sought to take a lesser role . because they say Hasan is actively seeking the death penalty. Tragedy on base: Soldiers grieve together during the memorial service for the 13 victims of the Fort Hood shooting rampage . The standby lawyers say their code of ethics prevents them from assisting. Hasan has disputed the assertion he is seeking the death penalty for himself, and military judge Colonel Tara Osborn has denied the lawyers' request to reduce their role. Hasan was 'encouraging or working toward the death penalty,' one of his lawyers, Lieutenant Colonel Kris Poppe, told Osborn during the court-martial. The lead military prosecutor has said Hasan at the time of the attack wanted to avoid his impending deployment to Afghanistan and felt a religious duty to kill as many soldiers as possible. Many of the witnesses have said they at first believed the shooting was a training exercise because soldiers are normally prohibited from carrying weapons on base. A review by a former FBI director found Hasan had exchanged emails with Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born cleric linked to al Qaeda's Yemen-based wing. Awlaki was killed in a U.S. drone strike. The mental health report said Hasan wore earplugs to muffle his semi-automatic handgun blasts and chose areas at the Soldier Readiness Processing Center that had the 'greatest density' of uniformed military personnel. He also told the panel he prayed in the morning at a mosque in nearby Killeen, Texas, on the day of the shootings and destroyed personal identification, which he would not need because he would either be killed or in jail. Hasan denied that depression or anxiety contributed to his motive. 'I don't think what I did was wrong because it was for the greater cause of helping my Muslim brothers,' he told the military panel.","Major Nidal Hasan is accused of killing 13 people and wounding more than 30 others in the attack at the Texas military base in 2009 .

Pakistan's former president Pervez Musharraf was today charged with murder over the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in 2007. The move completes the downfall of the man who once dominated his country but was driven out of office and exiled in disgrace. The decision by a court in Rawalpindi marks the first time any former army chief has been charged with a crime in Pakistan. Charge: Pervez Musharraf, left, is accused of murder over the death of Benazir Bhutto, right, at a rally in 2007 . Musharraf has been charged with murder, conspiracy to commit murder and facilitation for murder. The former army commando who took power in a coup in 1999 appeared in person at the hearing and pleaded not guilty to all charges. The next hearing will take place on August 27, when the first evidence will be presented. Ms Bhutto was killed in December 2007 during a gun and bomb attack at a political rally in Rawalpindi. Prosecutors claim that Musharraf, who was then president, failed to protect her properly. Trial: Musharraf is pictured being driven away from today's hearing in Rawalpindi under tight security . Musharraf, 70, left Pakistan in 2008 after being forced to resign from office, but returned to the country in March and vowed to contest this year's elections. However, the former leader enjoys little popular support, and has been faced with a host of legal problems dating back to his time in power. He has been confined to his house on the outskirts of Islamabad, and was brought to court today surrounded by tight security. In addition to the Bhutto case, Musharraf is involved in a case related to the detention of judges and the death of a separatist leader. He also faces threats from the Pakistani Taliban, which tried to assassinate him twice while he was in office and vowed to try again if he returned.","Pervez Musharraf pleaded not guilty to charges at a court in Rawalpindi .

People living nearby were left suffering from depression and nervous illnesses caused by the Newell family's behaviour. PC Sian Weyman told magistrates: 'The effect the family was having on neighbours was immense. 'They have been exposed to years of continued noise, banging, shouting, screaming, swearing and recently threats. 'Neighbours have expressed concerns for their personal safety and for their property.' The residents of the terraced house in Mountain Ash, South Wales, were named as 54-year-old Hilary Newell, her two adult sons Matthew Newell and Mark Pugh and her ex-husband David Newell.

These are the first ever modelling shots of a 15-year-old Reeva Steenkamp posing for a competition in her local newspaper. Wearing a jet-black leather jacket, she pulls off a range of poses including beaming smiles and sterner fashion stares. There are also images from another shoot taken a few months later on a beach in Port Elizabeth during a wedding fair. Angelic: A portrait of Reeva Steenkamp and a young girl on the beach in Port Elizabeth, South Africa when the aspiring model was just 15 years old . The future girlfriend of accused . murderer Oscar Pistorius beat 300 other entrants to get into the top 12 . of the competition, run by the now-closed Evening Post in Port . Elizabeth. The images emerged as the 'Blade Runner' returned to court yesterday on what would have been Steenkamp's 30th birthday. He was told he will face trial for the premeditated murder of Reeva in March next year. All of the photographs were taken by photographer Mark West, now 43, who described her as a 'diamond'. Model in the making: The future girlfriend of accused murderer Oscar Pistorius beat 300 other entrants to get into the top 12 of the competition . Wiping tears from his eyes, a visibly emotional Pistorius stood silently in the dock as he was formally indicted for premeditated murder at Pretoria Magistrates' Court. The 26-year-old Paralympian, from South Africa, is accused of shooting Ms Steenkamp to death at their home on Valentine's night, but claims he opened fire on the 29-year-old after mistaking her for an intruder. And after a hush finally descended on the packed courtroom, the judge set his trial to run from March 3 to March 20 next year at North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria. Stunning: Photographs of model and law graduate Reeva Steenkamp in her first fashion shoot, aged 15, in Port Elizabeth, which was submitted to her local newspaper . The prosecution will present 107 witnesses, some of whom allegedly heard a woman scream, followed by 'moments of silence, then heard gunshots and then more screaming', the indictment says. The state's witnesses will include Ms Steenkamp's close friends Desiree, Gina and Kim Myers, as well as Pistorius' sister Aimee and his uncle Arnold. Less than an hour after the hearing ended, Pistorius' brother Carl tweeted a photograph of Oscar and Ms Steenkamp posing together alongside the words: 'Remembered like yesterday. My life was impacted by u @reevasteenkamp & the lady u were! Always close to our hearts.' Before the hearing began he stood holding hands with sister Aimee and brother Carl as the three siblings prayed silently amid the commotion of the courtroom. Friends of Ms Steenkamp were also in court. Beautiful: There are also images from a shoot a few months later on a beach in Port Elizabeth, taken at a wedding fair . When asked by Magistrate Desmond Nair if he was well, he replied quietly: 'Under the circumstances, your honour.' But as proceedings were postponed, the BBC's Andrew Harding claimed to have shaken his hand and asked how he was, to which Pistorius apparently shook his head and mouthed: 'Not good.' The six-time Paralympic sprint champion was initially charged with premeditated murder for bail purposes while police investigated the circumstances of the shooting before a finalised indictment was served on the double amputee today. The prosecution will retain a main charge of premeditated murder. If convicted, Pistorius faces a life sentence with a minimum of 25 years in prison. It has been reported that the Paralympian could face extra charges of allegedly discharging a firearm recklessly in two other incidents. Papers presented at the court today are expected to include a witness list and detail some of the evidence police have gathered in the six months since the death of Ms Steenkamp. Pistorius is currently on bail after a judge changed his conditions in March, allowing him to travel abroad providing he hand over his travel plans. Happier days: This photograph of the couple was taken on November 4, 2012 during an awards ceremony in Johannesburg . The 'Blade Runner', who was recently spotted kayaking with friends in South Africa, has resumed a 'low-key track routine', according to his family. In a statement on his website in June, they said: 'Oscar is not contemplating a formal return to athletics and his training is not aimed at preparing for competition. 'His focus at this time remains entirely on the court case. His family, and those close to him, have encouraged him to spend a few hours a week on the track to assist him in finding the necessary mental and emotional equilibrium to process his trauma and prepare for the trial.' The athlete was 'overcome with emotion' when he pulled on his carbon fibre running blades for his first track training since Ms Steenkamp's death, his agent Peet van Zyl said, adding that Pistorius described his return to the track as 'bittersweet'. Ms Steenkamp's parents previously said they are still searching for answers. In a television interview in June, June Steenkamp said: 'There is only one person who knows what happened' on the night her daughter was killed. Meanwhile, Ms Steenkamp's uncle has said he has already forgiven Oscar Pistorius for killing her. Pressure: South African athlete Oscar Pistorius (left) speaks with his lawyer Kenny Oldwage before he was told he will face trial in March next year . Mike Steenkamp said the family have coped with her death by concentrating on her life rather than how she died. Today a lawyer for Reeva Steenkamp's parents said they are in contact with the family of Pistorius. The communication between the two families is over a possible out-of-court settlement that would compensate the Steenkamps for the killing of their daughter by the double-amputee Olympian, according to South African press reports. A South African newspaper reported that negotiations were initiated by Pistorius' lawyers, who the paper said were 'desperately trying' to negotiate a settlement before Pistorius goes on trial in March on a charge of premeditated murder for Steenkamp's shooting death. Dup de Bruyn, the lawyer for the Steenkamp family, told The Associated Press that 'the two sides are talking' but declined to comment further because of the delicate situation. Before her death, Steenkamp reportedly gave financial help to her parents, Barry and June. Pistorius denies murder and says he shot Steenkamp by mistake, thinking she was a dangerous nighttime intruder in his house. South Africa's Times newspaper reported that lawyers for Pistorius had approached Steenkamp's family, and the newspaper said Steenkamp's parents were seeking around $300,000 for loss of income and emotional stress. 'Pistorius' lawyers want to settle the lawsuit before the outcome of the criminal trial, in an attempt to reduce a possible payout,' The Times said in its front-page story. Pistorius is already under financial pressure because of his mounting legal bills. The Times said Kenny Oldwadge, one of Pistorius' lawyers, 'confirmed the discussions with Steenkamp's family.' 'You will understand this is a very sensitive situation,' Oldwadge said, according to the paper.","Future girlfriend of accused murderer Oscar Pistorius beat 300 other entrants to make the top 12 of the competition .

When arrested he told detectives it was 'easy money' A vet who made 'easy money' by defrauding insurance companies out of £225,000 by inventing pets and giving them non-existent treatment was jailed for two years today. Matthew Morgan, 38, used his expert knowledge to make the fraudulent claims saying he owned the pets over the space of three years. When arrested he told detectives it was 'easy money.' The vet, who earned £100,00 a year before tax, then lavished the money on a new £25,000 BMW, flew twice a year back to his homeland in Australia, stayed at expensive hotels and took luxury holidays. When he was arrested in January of this year he had tickets to go to Euro Disney on the Eurostar. Morgan who came to the UK in 2001 had already pocketed £198,000 from insurance companies and was awaiting the rest of the money when he was caught. Today at the Old Bailey Morgan of Goodworth Road, Redhill, Surrey, was jailed for two years after he admitted four counts of fraud from September 2009 to November 2012. The court heard that between 2008 and 2012 he had earned £291,751 . Father-of-three Morgan, who took home £5,000 a month, used an official stamp and template from his employer North Kent Referrals in Chatham to make 54 claims against insurers Petplan, Petprotect, Direct Line and Sainsbury’s. He first made a false claim saying his pet cat had been involved in a road accident. All the claims were in his name and he gave his address and bank details. In mitigation his barrister argued Morgan had carried out the frauds to pay off a £200,000 debt run up after his marriage to his first wife collapsed and his bid to buy a vet surgery failed. He claimed Morgan had become addicted to clearing his debts but when he was arrested the vet owed just £21,000. However back in his native Australia it emerged he had conviction for burglary and obtaining property by deception. Sentencing him at the Old Bailey today, Judge Wendy Joseph QC said Morgan was a man who 'not willing to curtail his expenditure to come in line with his means' which resulted in him racking up debts. She said: 'This was a course of behaviour which happened over three years and involved at least 50 separate acts of dishonesty. 'You attempted to gain £226,000 when actually you obtained £198,000. 'In 2009 you took out pet insurance for your cat. You then said she was in a car accident and you made claims for her medical treatment. 'You made up more and more cats, each suffering from fictitious illnesses or injuries. He used an official stamp and template from his employer North Kent Referrals in Chatham to make 54 claims against insurers . 'You were abusing your position of trust (at the vet surgery) and the extent of that abuse only became clear after your arrest. 'You . were using their headed paper, stamp and template and even took them . with you when you left the surgery so you could continue your fraudulent . activity thereafter. 'You used your knowledge as a vet to deceive the insurance companies. 'I accept that you had debts. I do not accept this is the whole truth of the matter. His barrister argued Morgan had carried out the frauds to pay off a £200,000 debt . 'You came over from Australia in 2001. You over extended yourself and got in debt. 'The picture of the years that follow is frankly the behaviour of a man who is not willing to curtail his expenditure to come in line with his means. 'As for your remorse, I am far from convinced of that. 'It seems to me Mr Morgan that you have fooled yourself as much as other people about the person you really are.' Judge Joseph also called for the destruction of the stamp and template which Morgan used to create the fake insurance claims. Confiscation proceedings against Morgan have begun. Martin Ingle, defending Morgan, said his client had nothing to hand over. He said: 'My client has no assets, no property and no money stored away. He has debts of around £20,000.' Morgan is also being referred to the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons where he faces being suspended or struck off the register. Speaking after the sentencing, DS Craig Mullish, who ran the City of London Police’s Insurance Fraud Enforcement Department (IFED) investigation, said: 'Morgan was paid a good salary to help sick animals, but over three years he systematically abused his position to claim massive payouts for surgeries on pets that did not exist. 'His sole motivation was to maintain an image of being a successful vet through the portrayal of an extravagant lifestyle. 'Morgan’s sentence highlights again how IFED is working with industry to bring insurance fraudsters to justice wherever they are and whatever they do.' A Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons spokesperson said: 'We have been liaising with IFED about this case for some time. 'Now that a conviction against Matthew Morgan has been secured and sentence handed down, we will raise an allegation against him and invite him to respond. 'The case, as a conviction, will then be passed immediately to our Preliminary Investigation Committee, which will be able to consider the details of the case and decide the most appropriate course of action.'","Matthew Morgan used an official stamp and template from his employer North Kent Referrals in Chatham to make 54 claims against insurers .

Allegations: 'Jessica', a girl of 14, claims that she was sexually abused by a violent criminal but the authorities did not intervene (posed by model) A violent criminal accused of having regular sex with a 14-year-old abused her daily because social services claimed to have 'no power' to stop him, it emerged today. On one occasion the alleged victim, 'Jessica', who fell pregnant twice, ran away and was found half naked under married father-of-two Arshid Hussain's bed but police arrested her and let him go, secret documents have revealed. Hussain, then 24, had convictions for robbery and affray, and was about to be jailed for violent disorder. But Rotherham social services allegedly told  Jessica's mother they couldn't stop the relationship because she 'went willingly'. The Times revealed today that Hussain has never been prosecuted for suspected child sex offences, but is now being investigated 14 years on. At the time he was on a social services list of men believed to be grooming up to 40 young girls and more than a dozen believed he was their 'boyfriend'. Speaking about when she was caught in bed with him by police, Jessica, which is not her real name, told The Times: 'I was in bed upstairs with Ash when the police came into the house. He panicked and pulled on some trousers. 'I grabbed a pair of knickers and tried to hide under the bed. One of the police officers told me to come out. He could see my legs sticking out.'; . Officers then found an offensive weapon and she was arrested, but despite noting later she was 'at risk of sexual abuse' Hussain was released. The case in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, which has become known as Britain's under-age sex capital, is another example of where the authorities have let down a vulnerable children. Under fire: It has been alleged that Rotherham Borough Council (pictured) said they had 'no power' to intervene despite an admission the man and girl were having sex . It has been alleged that current . council deputy leader, Labour's Jagangir Akhtar, who is related to . Hussain, had known of the relationship. The Times' Chief Investigative Reporter, Andrew Norfolk, said on an occasion when Jessica went missing Mr Akhtar set up a 'deal under which a violent offender (Hussain) agreed to hand a missing child to police after being assured that he would not be detained'. But Mr Akhtar, who was a taxi driver at the time, told MailOnline today 'it is total lies' that he knew Hussain was grooming the girl. He also denied there was any deal. Later, Rotherham Council said Mr Akhtar had stepped down from two key roles with the authority - as deputy leader of the council and vice chairman of the Police and Crime Panel. The spokesman said: 'The council has referred the allegations made in the Times newspaper relating to councillor Akhtar to South Yorkshire Police to consider if any criminal offence has been committed and to undertake any appropriate criminal investigation.' Jessica described how she met Hussain days after her 14th birthday in 1999, and after he bought her chicken and chips he took her to some woods and told her: 'You're not really 16 are you? You look too young'. They starting seeing eachother regularly and her parents could not keep them apart. In the end she was taken into 'emergency' care. But Jessica was barely in school so the relationship continued, and Hussain would even follow her on holiday, on one occasion renting a caravan in Skegness so they could have sex there. In June 2000 police and social services reports said that Hussain and the girl, now 15, were 'known to be having a sexual relationship' and she was 'at risk of sexual abuse'. After he was sent to prison for violent disorder and intimidation in a different case, Jessica got an injunction against him. 'It was like somebody put a spell on me. I . wanted to marry him. He didn't tell me he was already . married,' Jessica said. 'I didn't think of myself as being groomed, but now I . realise it was an abusive relationship. It can . stay with you for the rest of your life. 'Police and social . services don't want to take any responsibility for what happened back . then'. Damaging:The authorities in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, have been accused of turning a blind eye to sex grooming gangs for more than a decade, confidential files have revealed . A Home Office funded review, examining her case, quoted by The Times said: 'Perpetrator was allowed to contact (Jessica) via mobile telephone, . was allowed to arrange to collect her from foster carer's home by . ringing in advance and asking to meet him at the end of . street' with the 'knowledge and consent' of social services. There was an 'unwillingness to recognise danger of relationship' an 'in the absence of any criminal prosecution of perpetrator as a pimp, all rumours about him were speculation and there was no cause for concern', the paperwork revealed. Staff 'also took some comfort in knowing where (Jessica) was', it said, and Hussain was even allowed to attend appointments with her GP. Solicitor Riyaz Shaikh told MailOnline this afternoon that his client Hussain is unwell and unable to comment today. A spokesman for Rotherham Borough Council said following Operation Yewtree, the authority asked South Yorkshire Police (SYP) to thoroughly review all historical cases that may be linked to child sexual exploitation. He added: 'That review is ongoing and continues with a number of live and ongoing investigations. The Council wishes to support SYP and not potentially compromise this process. As such we will not be making further comments on the article without further consultation with our police colleagues.' South Yorkshire Police said it 'deeply regrets' the publication of the Times story 'about an on-going, complex and highly sensitive investigation into matters of historic child sexual exploitation'. Last year it emerged police in the . town turned a blind eye to allegations of sexual abuse of white girls by . gangs of largely Pakistani men for more than a decade. Research, . reports and case files also revealed that council officials were . desperate to cover up any racial link to the abuse of young girls. The . research shows that a string of warnings dating back as far as 2000 . were ignored by the authorities. In many cases, police action was taken . only against the victims. There is no evidence to link Arshid Hussain to this crime.","Alleged victim, 'Jessica', says married Arshid Hussain groomed her .

Student halls in Oxford, a budget hotel in central London and a 'vertical pier' in Redcar are all in the running to be named Britain's ugliest new building. The shortlist for the annual Carbuncle Cup has been revealed, highlighting six new buildings judged to be the latest 'architectural travesties' erected across Britain. The name of the competition is inspired by Prince Charles's description of Richard Rogers proposed National Gallery extension as a 'monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much-loved friend.' Controversial: Oxford University's Castle Mill student accommodation by Port Meadow, Oxford, which has the unenviable distinction of being the most-nominated project in the history of the Carbuncle Cup . That extension was never built, but the prince's evocative description lives on thanks to trade magazine Building Design, which launched the competition eight years ago as a comic counterpart to the prestigious Stirling prize. In a statement the magazine said: 'Even in times of economic turmoil, when few major projects are being built, hundreds of architectural travesties are allowed to pass through our planning system on a weekly basis. 'Few of these are ever truly exposed . for the awfulness they represent - lazy design, compromised planning . departments and cynical development.' The . shortlist has been whittled down from hundreds of nominations sent in . by readers of Building Design, which caters to an audience of architects . and designers. Grim: The UCL student accommodation at 465 Caledonian Road was nearly refused planning permission because of a lack of natural light . First on the list is a project that has had the unenviable distinction of being the most-nominated development in the history of the Carbuncle Cup, says Building Design. Castle Mill housing in Oxford, designed by Frankham Consultancy Group, is comprised of eight very plain blocks of Oxford University student accommodation plonked right next to the picturesque Port Meadow, an area of land beside the Thames that has hardly changed in thousands of years. The project, described as like building a 'skyscraper next to Stonehenge', has been mired in controversy and it is now at the centre of a judicial review bid to determine if the planning process which led to its approval was properly carried out. Another block of student accommodation which made the Carbuncle Cup's shortlist was initially refused its planning permission on the grounds that not enough light would enter the building to make it liveable. The block at number 465 Caledonian Road, near King's Cross, which will house students at University College London was only built after an inspector decided that the student lifestyle meant that rooms would only be used for sleeping - so they didn't need their legal quota of natural light. Despite its £18milllion pound cost, The Islington Tribune quoted one local resident who described the development as 'so cheap and aesthetically bankrupt it can only be described as an insult to the people of N7, and the architectural profession.' It is designed by Stephen George & Partners. 'Grossly over-scaled': The Avant Garde building on Bethnal Green Road in Shoreditch, London, a 'characterless lump' which critics have slammed for failing to blend into the Victorian buildings that surround it . Another residential monstrosity in the running for Britain's ugliest building of the year is the 25-storey Avant Garde building on Bethnal Green Road in London's trendy Shoreditch area, which Building Design describe as 'grossly over-scaled'. The Stock Woolstencroft development has been slammed for its failure to blend in with neighbouring Victorian buildings, with the critic who nominated it calling it a 'hideous monstrosity... a characterless lump that is totally out of scale to the buildings around it.' The third London newbuild to make the shortlist is the 234-room Premier Inn on York Road in Waterloo, designed by Hamiltons, part of which is housed in a listed former maternity hospital. 'Lumpen': The 234-room Premier Inn on York Road in Waterloo, designed by Hamiltons, is the third London building to make the Carbuncle Cup shortlist, and which building design describes as a 'travesty' The rest of the building has taken the place of a Thirties red-brick neo-Georgian nurses' home demolished to make was for its tower. Building Design says: 'The Premier Inn in Lambeth is a travesty in more ways than one - we shudder at its lumpen form and mourn the building demolished to make way for it.' Elsewhere, the Redcar Beacon by Smeeden Foreman Architects is slammed as 'shape making gone horribly, horribly wrong.' Vertical pier: The Redcar Beacon was unveiled in March as the centrepiece of a £75million seafront regeneration. Critics said they would have preferred a conventional, horizontal pier instead . 'The dumpster': The stark-looking Porth Eirias Watersports Centre in Colwyn Bay, Wales, is also part of a multimillion pound seafront redevelopment, but its skip-like shape has led to an unfortunate nickname . The brightly coloured 80ft tower - reminiscent of the shape of a fun fair helter skelter - was unveiled in March as the centrepiece of a £75million seafront regeneration on the North East seaside town. It is described as a 'vertical pier', but critics said they would have preferred a normal, horizontal pier instead. Making up the final place on the Carbuncle Cup shortlist is the Porth Eirias Watersports Centre in Colwyn Bay, Wales, by K2 Architects. The stark-looking structure is also part of a multimillion pound seafront redevelopment, but its curious skip-like shape has now apparently led locals to dub it 'the dumpster'. A critic dubbed it 'oppressively bland and totally insensitive to the beautiful surrounding coast.' A final winner will be selected by a jury including Building Design executive editor Ellis Woodman and critics Owen Hatherley and Gillian Darley and announced on August 30.","These are the developments shortlisted for Building Design magazine's annual Carbuncle Cup, awarded each year to Britain's ugliest new building ."

A benefit cheat who claimed over £17,000 because he couldn't walk more than 15 yards has walked free from court despite being photographed running a half marathon. Shameless Noel Sanders, 55, told authorities that he suffered from crippling arthritis and high blood pressure - leaving him unable to even cut up his own food. But instead he was an active member of his local running club, rising to the position of club secretary. Shameless: Benefit cheat Noel Sanders pictured in April 2004 with his acceptance form for the London Marathon, he had previously told authorities that he needed help getting out of bed . Sanders, from Brierly Hill, West Mids, pleaded guilty to two counts of failing to notify authorities of a change of circumstances at Dudley Magistrates Court on Friday. He was handed a 12-week prison sentence, suspended for six months, and ordered to undergo a 12 month community order. The court heard that sneaky Sanders had been assessed in 2002 and awarded the highest rate of disability living allowance due to his illness. He told officials he needed help seven days a week to get out of bed, dress himself and go to the toilet. He claimed he could not prepare his own meals and couldn't even manage to cut up meat himself. Sanders even told officials he needed someone with him whenever he went outside in case he collapsed. Between 2009, when he took up running again, and January 2013 Sanders claimed £12,290.35 in Disability Living Allowance and £5,173.37 in Job Seekers Allowance. Caught: Sanders competing in the Coll half marathon after claiming that he was so ill he needed help seven days a week just to get out of bed . He was caught when DWP officials discovered he was a member of nearby Stourbridge Running Club, who then provided a picture of Sanders running the Coll Half Marathon. Sentencing him, Dawn Gill, Chair of the bench said: 'The sentence is 12 weeks with regard to the DLA and 12 weeks for the JSA, they will run concurrently. 'We have taken into account the fact that this offence is so serious that it cannot be dealt with by a community order alone. 'We require that you complete the benefit fraud workbook, if you break this order or commit another offence you can expect to serve your prison sentence. 'These offences were carried out over a significant period of time and the value of the crime was in excess of £17,000. 'We also take into account the blatant nature of the offence in that you have been running marathons while claiming this level of disability. 'You have taken action, we are told you have repaid all the money.' Suki Rai, prosecuting, told the court: 'The club chairman confirmed that he was a member of the club, and that he had been club secretary for two years. 'He said he had never seen the defendant using a walking aid and that he was a slow runner but walked normally. 'He said that the defendant had run many races, he had run 10 kilometre races and 20 mile races. 'He had run 27 races for the club and his fastest half marathon time was 2 hours 29 minutes. Not smiling anymore: Sanders at Dudley Magistrates' Court his defence team said he feels 'devastated, forlorn and regretful' after pleading guilty to benefit fraud . Active: Sanders running club provided records of his races over the last four years including his fastest half marathon time of 2 hours and 29 minutes . 'The chairman also said he had run cross country races with him, where the ground would be uneven and slippery.' She added that when confronted Sanders had tried to talk his way out of the offences. She added: 'When he was presented with the evidence the defendant said he had taken up running again and lost weight after he became scared when his father died. 'He said he had used techniques to run through the pain and that he had been in excruciating pain while running. 'He claimed he had tried to ask officials how his running would affect his claim and was told that if the change was permanent his allowance would be stopped and if it was only temporary it would continue.' Jahangeer Aslam, defending, said: 'Mr Sanders tells me he feels devastated, forlorn and regretful. 'He suffers from arthritis, high blood pressure, and is on 14 different medications. 'He tells me he used to weigh 16 stone but has lost weight and now weighs around 11, which has contributed to his improved mobility. 'The DWP have confirmed that he has paid back the money, he did this using an inheritance he received from his father. 'He is looking for work at the moment that he can do with his conditions. 'He tells me he has a sister he is in contact with, and no other relatives. He said he does have a friend and he feels stupid and embarrassed that he has let down the society he was a part of. 'He has not lived an extravagant lifestyle, and he will have to live with the consequences of what he has done for the rest of his life.""

George Osborne yesterday won backing from the International Monetary Fund, as it welcomed improvements in the economy. It will come as a relief to the Chancellor who was last month heavily criticised by the watchdog's chief economist for sticking to his austerity policies. The IMF yesterday urged Mr Osborne to cut business taxes and increase infrastructure spending to build on the burgeoning recovery. Managing director of the International Monetary Fund Christine Lagarde arrives to the Group of Seven finance ministers meeting in Aylesbury (left) and George Osborne . It also warned the country remains 'a long way from a strong and sustainable recovery' because of the eurozone crisis, a shortage of bank lending and government cuts. The annual report on the UK, published after two weeks of in-depth analysis by IMF inspectors, called for extra spending to offset the impact of his planned cuts this year but stopped short of demanding that austerity is ditched altogether. Indeed, it backed the Chancellor's 'essential' efforts to eliminate the record £159billion deficit racked up by Labour and described his plans as 'credible'. Mr Osborne said: 'I agree that it is right to prioritise infrastructure investment where we can. 'That's why we are investing more in capital than my predecessor planned. That's why I've added in the last two years to those plans. And that's why it will be a focus of the spending round next month.' The IMF report came as official figures yesterday showed the Government borrowed £119.5billion last year, slightly down from £120.9billion in 2011-12. While backing the deficit reduction, the IMF report went on to warn that the £10billion of cuts due this year 'will be a drag on growth'. The Chancellor addressed a press conference at the Treasury, with IMF assessors looking on after their issued their call for measures to boost growth . To ensure stronger growth, the report . called for tax cuts for businesses and billions of pounds of extra . spending on infrastructure projects such as schools repairs and social . housing. It said: 'Given the tepid recovery, policy should capitalise on the nascent signs of momentum to bolster growth.' It . also called on ministers to outline a 'clear strategy' for selling . government stakes in taxpayer-backed lenders Royal Bank of Scotland and . Lloyds Banking Group. And it . urged the Bank of England to consider pumping more money into the . economy and 'provide assurance' to households and investors that . interest rates will remain at rock bottom 'until the recovery reaches . full momentum'. The analysis of the Chancellor's handling of the economy was better than many in the Treasury feared. Last . month the Fund's chief economist Olivier Blanchard accused Mr Osborne . of 'playing with fire' by sticking with his austerity policies while the . economy was so weak. However, . David Lipton, deputy to IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, . acknowledged 'there is no single silver bullet' to solve the UK's . problems. He said: 'We recognise that higher fiscal support for the . economy is not a straight forward as the deficit is still high. 'But the Government's credible medium-term consolidation plan affords space to provide this support. 'The Government should be more supportive of growth than it has been and plans to be.' Shadow . chancellor Ed Balls said: 'The IMF is clear that we are a long way from . the strong and sustained recovery we need, and backs the warnings we . have made for three years that the Government's plans are a drag on . growth and risk doing long-term damage.' But . John Cridland, director general of the CBI, said: 'The IMF's assessment . chimes with our own view that a modest recovery looks to be taking . shape.

Rank upon rank of neatly regimented towels stretching across the sands can only mean one thing. The Germans have invaded Britain - or the British coast at any rate. Figures from VisitBritain show that more than half a million Germans are enjoying a spot of our glorious British weather in seaside towns including Brighton, Penzance and Torquay. Sonne, Schwimmen, Sport! German tourists are flocking to seaside destinations such as Fistral Surfing Beach in Cornwall to get a touch of the bracing British sea air . This means more Germans are choosing to holiday along the UK's 7,723-mile coastline than visitors from any other nation. Latest figures put our Teutonic neighbours in only second place to the French in terms of visits to the UK, with 2,989 Germans coming to Britain between April 2011 and March 2012 compared with 3,820 people from France. But yesterday's figures show those Germans who do come here are making a beeline for the beach, with 523,000 - 18 per cent of those coming to Britain - choosing coastal destinations last year. By contrast, only 4,000 (13 per cent) of French visitors and just 355,000 (12 per cent) of Americans chose the UK as seaside destination. Only three per cent of tourists from sunnier climes such as Brazil picked the British seaside. Old and new: Sports and Britain's mix of history and modern culture were picked by foreign visitors as the main reasons for coming to the UK . Les rosbifs: British culinary classics such as the traditional Sunday roast were not so popular amongst holiday makers from outside the UK . The findings come from a report into what the tourist authority can do to boost visits to Britain's coastline. A peculiarly Germanic drive to colonise our sun loungers may not be the only reason they are drawn to the coast. 'Aga sagas': The romantic Cornwall-based novels of Rosamunde Pilcher such as The Shell Seekers and Cliffs Of Love were the basis of a German TV series . VisitBritain listed Cornwall, along with East Sussex, as the most popular destination for German tourists - Cornwall being the location of writer Rosamunde Pilcher's novels, which formed the basis of an 89-part TV series in Germany. The show gained a popularity akin to that of Downton Abbey, with as many as seven million viewers tuning into them on Sunday nights. It's perhaps not surprising, then, that . Cornwall and Devon alone saw a 14 per cent increase in visits from . German tourists last year - many taking part in Pilcher-themed tours . around the South West of England. This was despite the fact that the total number of Germans visiting the UK rose by just two per cent - while visitors from other countries such as the U.S., Australia and Canada fell. And Germans remained stubbornly budget-driven while on holiday over here, their percentage spend rising by just one per cent between last year and 2011 - compared with a 34 per cent spending increase from French visitors. A spokesman from VisitBritain said: 'Over the past six years the coastal counties of East Sussex and Cornwall have attracted more than 80,000 German holidaymakers a year, significantly more than those countries attract from all other major markets. 'This tends to indicate that the possibility for coastal walks exerts a strong influence on where Germans choose to holiday in Britain.' Reserviert: The stereotype of the German tourist laying their towel out to 'book' a beach spot could be becoming a common Cornish sight . More than 35million visitors a year (12 per cent) took to the UK's coastline, the spokesman said. However, the 'beautiful coastline' came last in a list of reasons for visiting - along with British food - according to questionnaire-based research. The top reason given for visiting was our 'rich sporting offer', followed by music festivals, heritage, the mixture of 'old and new' and the British countryside.","More Germans choosing to visit British coast than any other nation.

Education Secretary Michael Gove has accused Ed Miliband of threatening to impose a £40 million ‘Militax’ on voters by forcing them to pick up the bill for running Britain’s political parties. In an outspoken attack, Mr Gove says Mr Miliband’s recent call for a ban on political donations of more than £5,000 from individuals would inevitably lead to state funding  for the Conservatives, Labour and Lib Dems. And he argues Mr Miliband’s proposal is primarily designed to deflect attention from the row over the way that Labour is bankrolled by unions such as Len McCluskey’s Unite. Mr Gove, increasingly seen as a possible successor to David Cameron as Tory leader, claims  Mr Miliband is trying to revive plans by the last Labour Government to introduce state funding of political parties. ‘There are few dirtier monetary transactions than politicians agreeing to pick the pockets of people poorer than themselves to fund activities which should be supported voluntarily,’ writes Mr Gove in today’s Mail on Sunday. ‘That is the position Labour is  now embracing – call it what you will, a spin tax, a “Militax”, a “going to the poll” tax – it’s all the same thing... more taxes to pay for  more politicians spending more of your money. ‘Hard-working people pay enough tax...But if Ed Miliband gets his way you will be forced to pay  for him.’ Striker: Michael Gove (Front row, left) on the picket line during the year-long strike at The Press and Journal newspaper in 1989 as a cub reporter . Tory sources say the £40 million ‘Militax’ is based on the 2011 Kelly review of party funding which said a £10,000 cap could lead to a shortfall of more than £20 million a year. They say that would double under Mr Miliband’s £5,000 cap. In a keynote speech on Tuesday, Mr Gove plans to make a wider attack on Labour’s links to the unions. But he will deny the Conservatives are anti-union and recall his own experience as a striker. The Education Secretary, who has denounced ‘bigotry’ in teaching unions for holding back children  by staging industrial action, walked out while working on a regional newspaper in 1989. He claimed that he ‘didn’t agree’ with the walkout but as a cub reporter and new union member he felt duty bound to join the picket line. Mr Miliband says the £5,000  cap is vital to stop rich Tory supporters making donations of tens  of thousands of pounds to gain  access and influence in the Conservative Party. Behind the scenes: Len McCluskey, General Secretary of the union Unite, is trying to secure enough Labour Party members to deliver his agenda . Mr Gove’s ‘Militax’ jibe will be seen as an attempt to counter  damaging Labour attacks on the Tories over the so-called ‘bedroom tax’ and other controversial levies dubbed the ‘granny tax’ and the ‘pasty tax’. Mr Cameron has suggested a £50,000 cap on donations. A Labour official said: ‘The Tories have plucked the figure of £40  million from the air. The public is appalled by the way the rich can buy their way on to the top table of the Conservative Party. ‘Labour is taking steps to reform its relationship with the unions and the Tories should clean up their own backyard before criticising us.’","Miliband’s proposal is designed to deflect attention from the way that Labour is .

Incursion: A Spanish police diver hold up the Spanish flag while inspecting one of the concrete blocks dropped by the Gibraltan government off the coast to encourage marine life . Contentious: The Spanish Civil Guard (Guardia Civil) last night released footage of divers inspecting concrete blocks dropped into waters surrounding Gibraltar to encourage more marine life . Breach: The diving stunt has been criticised by the Gibraltan government who accused the Spanish police of a 'serious incursion' into British Gibratar territorial waters . Gibraltar Governor Sir Adrian Johns said: 'The act of diving itself constituted a serious violation of British sovereignty but this apparent interference with the reef is a new and worrying aspect.' The police divers can be seen in the footage apparently measuring some of the 74 concrete blocks which were dropped into the sea by Gibraltar last month to make a man-made reef and encourage marine life. Spain wants the reef removed, claiming it prevents Spanish fishermen from accessing the waters surrounding Gibraltar. The Gibraltar government said in a statement: 'Her Majesty's Government of Gibraltar notes the incident of executive action taken by the guardia civil in British Gibraltar territorial waters in the area of the new artificial reef. 'The matter of this serious incursion will not assist in de-escalating the present tensions.' Olive branch: Gibraltar's First Minister Fabian Picardo has promising to let Spanish fishermen return to British waters . It comes as Gibraltar's chief minister attempts to defuse the bitter dispute with Spain by promising to let its . fishermen return to British waters. Fabian Picardo is to propose a change in local law to let them resume fishing in parts of the sea near the Rock. The . law change allows them to ‘fish again according to their ancient . practice’. It will be greeted as a victory by the 59 Spanish boats that . want to use the waters. They . include one called Divina Providencia – Divine Providence in English – . whose skipper Francisco Gomez has been involved in numerous . confrontations with Royal Gibraltar Police vessels. He . and his colleagues want access to waters closer to shore so they can . catch better quality shellfish. He was charged by the Gibraltar . authorities in May for ‘entry into British waters, illegal fishing, . reckless navigation and failure to respect the authorities’. Tensions . have also been building over the last 18 months because Mr Picardo . started enforcing a 1991 environmental protection law. That law banned some nets used by Spanish fishermen,  including drift nets and gill nets. Mr . Picardo’s move is the clearest hint yet that Gibraltar may be prepared . to compromise on certain types of nets after 14 months of meetings with . fishermen and local Spanish mayors. But . Mr Picardo insisted the law change has nothing to do with Spain’s . border security checks that have caused a political outcry amid six-hour . queues in and out of the British territory. Protest: Spanish fishermen staged a protest this week at the site of an . artificial reef built in Algeciras Bay, which they say ruins traditional . fishing grounds . Row: A fleet of 38 Spanish fishing boats sailed towards Gibraltar last weekend to demand the British outpost remove 70 concrete blocks it has . dropped in their fishing grounds . He . said: ‘The Spanish government’s politically motivated queues at the . frontier and the threats made about Gibraltar have not and will not . succeed in changing the position of Her Majesty’s Government of . Gibraltar. ‘In the same way as such tactics will not serve to “soften” Gibraltar, neither will we allow them to harden our position.’ He also insisted that 70 controversial concrete blocks dumped in the sea to create an artificial reef would remain. The area where the reef has been created will also remain off-limits to fishing. But . Mr Picardo ruled out any surrender last night by saying: 'We have . decided the blocks shouldn't be moved because we are not doing anything . that really affects the fishermen's ability to fish.' Gibraltar . claims three nautical miles around the Rock as its own. Spain insists . the waters outside of Gibraltar's port belong to them.

Vice President Joe Biden's son, Beau, has returned home with his father and other family members after undergoing a complicated brain biopsy procedure at a Houston cancer center. A small motorcade arrived at Vice President Biden's home just before 4pm on Thursday, shortly after Air Force Two arrived at New Castle County airport from Texas. Beau Biden, the Delaware attorney-general, tweeted: 'On our way home! Can't wait to get back. Thank you, Houston,' and uploaded a photo of him with his wife and parents. Happy farewell: Beau Biden posted this picture of him standing with his wife, stepmother Jill and father Joe as he was about to leave the Houston hospital . Back home: Beau Biden, pictured with his father, Vice-President Biden earlier this week, has returned home from hospital . He also tweeted a photo of himself and his wife Hallie in Houston, saying: 'Touched by all your well wishes - thank you. Nice evening in Houston w/ Hallie; will share update when we have it.' The 44-year-old was admitted to University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center for a brain biopsy earlier this week after becoming weak and disoriented during a vacation in Indiana. 'You can read from that that it's likely that there was a tumor or some kind of tissue left behind from this mass that was biopsied,' Dr Nancy Snyderman told NBC News. She added that it can takes weeks for results of biopsies to arrive. The father-of-two's hospital stay came two weeks after emergency dispatchers received a call from the vice-president's home regarding a report of a possible stroke. Mr Biden, who was staying at his father's Delaware home while his home is being renovated, suffered a minor stroke in 2010.

The Vice President's son had a stroke in 2010. The White House released a statement from Joe and Jill Biden Wednesday announcing Beau had undergone an unnamed procedure . Mr Biden then arrived on Monday in Houston for tests at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Emergency . responders were also called earlier this month to the home where he had . been staying, two weeks before he was taken to hospital during a family . vacation, authorities said on Wednesday. Rickie Clark, a staff supervisor with the Cranston Heights Fire Co., confirmed on Wednesday that county dispatchers received a call for help from the vice-president's home. However, he refused to provide further details. The dispatch log on the fire department's website showed two references to the vice-president's home on August 1, one at 9:25pm and another about a minute and a half later. All clear: The Biden's motorcade was seen leaving the Houston hospital Thursday morning . Procedure: A police officer stands guard at an entrance to the renowned MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas where Beau Biden underwent testing and a procedure Tuesday . Both cite ‘Cva-Not Alert,’ indicating . that a person was in distress and apparently not alert or responsive to . his or her surroundings. Mr Clark said ‘Cva’ is shorthand for . cerebrovascular accident, or stroke. Mr Biden was initially admitted to . Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago last week and traveled the . next day to the Philadelphia hospital where he had been treated for his . 2010 stroke to consult with his doctor. He spent last weekend at home in . Wilmington before going to Texas. The younger Biden has posted two . photos of himself in recent days - one of him smiling with his father on .

A pensioner bled to death over the course of two hours in hospital after his drip became detached from his hand, an inquest heard yesterday. James Bent, 86, was placed on an antibiotic drip after being admitted to hospital with numerous health complaints including diarrhoea, heart disease, pancreatitis and cirrhosis of the liver. But two hours later he was found collapsed in bed with a pool of blood on the floor after the drip tube feeding him the antibiotics became detached from the cannula - the plastic piece of apparatus connecting the tube to the vein - causing his blood to flow out of the opening. Staff at Royal Bolton Hospital in Greater Manchester immediately stopped the bleeding but Mr Bent went into cardiac arrest and could not be resuscitated. James Bent, 86, was placed on an antibiotic drip at Royal Bolton Hospital in Greater Manchester, pictured, but was found collapsed with a pool of blood by his bedside two hours later after the drip became detached . The inquest in Bolton heard that bachelor Mr Bent, from Leigh, was admitted to the hospital on . January 28 suffering from diarrhoea and was place in a . single room to prevent any infection from spreading. Mr Bent also had several pre-existing medical conditions, including heart disease plus . pancreatitis and cirrhosis of the liver thought to have been the result . of the weekly bottle of rum added to his coffee. On the night before he died, Staff nurse Catherine Maher said Mr Bent was struggling to sleep, pressing his call button every half hour. She said: 'He was frustrated and irritated. He couldn’t sleep and was angry about being in a side ward.' She last checked on Mr Bent at 6.35am on February 17 when she set up a new antibiotic drip, handing over to the day shift at 7.30am. But when Health care assistant Rose Nuttall went to ask Mr Bent what he wanted for breakfast at around 8.35am, she discovered him collapsed in his bed with a pool of blood on the floor. She called for help and nurses put a stop to the bleeding. Susan Fearon, acting sister on the ward, was one of the first into Mr Bent’s room after Mrs Nuttall found him. 'It was quite a shock. The fact that was . quite distressing to us was the gentleman was awake and looking at us . and in reach of his buzzer,' she said. While Mr Bent was left unsupervised for two hours, the inquest was told that patients with cannulas are usually only observed every four hours. The court heard how the drip tube was connected to the cannula’s three way tap by a single threaded screw which could easily be undone. Deputy coroner Alan Walsh ruled that Mr Bent would not have deliberately tried to harm himself but added that he did not believe the drip had been incorrectly set up. Giving a narrative verdict, Mr Walsh said that Mr Bent 'died as a consequence of the accidental detachment of a giving set (drip tube apparatus) used to administer intravenous antibiotics from a three way tap connected to a cannula inserted into an arm vein against a background of naturally occurring and alcohol related disease.' Speaking after the hearing Mr Bent’s nephew, Ken Atherton, said he accepted the coroner’s finding but was critical of the way his uncle was treated at the hospital before his death. He stressed that the pensioner, who had been a vegan since his early 20s and taught himself several languages,  lost a lot of weight as a result of his false teeth being lost just hours after his admission and claimed that requests for his food to be liquidized were ignored.","James Bent, 86, was admitted to hospital with several health complaints .

Attack: Vishar Jain, 44, stamped on the head of a four-year-old boy when he interrupted an episode of Doctor Who by sighing . A Doctor Who fan fractured a four-year-old boy's skull in a frenzied attack after the child interrupted an episode of the programme by sighing. Vishar Jain, 44, was jailed for nine years for the horrific attack which left the child in intensive care fighting for his life. The boy also suffered a fractured collarbone, cuts to his mouth and several bruises after repeatedly being punched and kicked. Jain also lashed out at his victim's mother when she tried to intervene to stop the abuse which left the boy emotionally scarred. The computer engineer, who had been in a relationship with the boy's mother for two years, has never provided an explanation for the attack, Birmingham Crown Court heard. He began raining blows and kicks as he sat on a sofa with the child and his mother. The boy, twice thrown to the wooden floor and stamped on, spent two weeks in hospital recovering from his injuries. Jain turned on the boy’s mother when she tried to rescue him. She suffered cuts and bruises to her face. Judge Philip Parker QC said that before the attack it had been an ordinary afternoon and the three had sat together watching the episode of Doctor Who. He told Jain: 'You became irritated by his behaviour when he was sitting between you and his mother. 'You chastised him and then what followed was a quite unexplained outburst of uncontrollable violence which was your reaction to no more than the child simply sighing.' Claire Harris, prosecuting, said that on March 23 the boy uttered something that Jain interpreted as interrupting the adults’ conversation. Doctor Who fan: Jain was watching an episode of the BBC programme when he attacked the child. Pictured is the new doctor Peter Capaldi . He slapped the child on his face. When his mother tried to intervene he slapped and punched her. Miss Harris said: 'He then lifted him up into the air and dropped him on the floor.' He lifted the child’s head and banged it on the wooden floor. He went on to repeatedly kick and stamp on his head. The boy’s mother said she remembered the 'banging noise' as her son hit the floor. He was motionless and she feared he was dead. The child was so traumatised by the attack that he suffered nightmares afterwards and would lapse into zombie-like trances, the judge was told. Doctor: Matt Smith plays Doctor Who in a recent episode of the BBC One television programme . Gerard Cullen, defending, said 'It is perhaps more by luck than judgment that the child has, in fact, recovered well from his physical injuries. 'Psychologically, of course, it is going to take a lot longer. This was not a case where there was any premeditation at all. This defendant simply snapped.' The court heard there was a 'significant risk' Jain, of Edgbaston, Birmingham, would behave in a totally unjustified and irrational way again. Jain admitted causing . grievous bodily harm with intent and common assault at an earlier hearing. Following the case, Detective Constable Hayley Bubb, from Birmingham’s Child Protection team, said: 'This was an unprovoked and sustained attack on a defenceless child, which he has never explained.'

It is also claimed he married another woman just weeks after Ms . Baldelli went missing. On Tuesday, a local on Isla Carenero discovered a 'green military style' backpack containing a human skull, some bones and women's clothing, according to law enforcement. Police on the island told a Panamanian website that size and shape of the skull suggested it was female. Miss Baldelli's boyfriend ex-Marine Brian . Brimager, 37, was arrested in June on charges of obstructing justice and making false statements . Brian Brimager is charged with covering-up the disappearance of his girlfriend Yvonne Baldelli, who went missing in Panama in November 2011 . Miss Baldelli was last seen at a steakhouse in . the town of Bocas del Toro with Brimager on November 26, 2011, according to the U.S. Attorney's office, which also said he physically abused her before she went missing.

The harrowing 911 call made by passersby who found the jogging Australian baseball player as he was struggling to breath has been released hours after his girlfriend spoke out about how his killers deserve to 'rot in hell'. The female caller spotted Chris Lane minutes after he was shot and called 911 but it took nearly seven minutes for emergency responders to arrive. 'He was standing in the roadway and he fell over and as I come by he just fell over in a ditch,' the woman, identified later as Joyce Smith, said to the 911 operator before describing how he was grasping for air. The operator finally dispatches emergency services three minutes into the conversation, and minutes later the caller notes that the young athlete's breathing has become even more shallow. 'He's not conscious...I hear no sirens, I see no lights. Oh my gosh, how long is it going to be?' About seven minutes after the call was placed, others have gathered to help the struggling victim while the woman remained on the line. Heartbroken: Sarah Harper (left) has spoken out about her devastation following her boyfriend Chris Lane's (right) drive by shooting on Friday when he was jogging near her house . 'Has he stopped breathing? Yes. Yes, they say he has. Finally here's some, finally here's some police,' she said. Lane was formally pronounced dead at a nearby hospital nearly an hour after the shooting is thought to have occurred. ‘I . don’t really care what happens to them,’ Sarah Harper said following . her boyfriend Chris Lane’s death on Friday in Duncan, Oklahoma. ‘I feel like if they don’t get what they deserve now and in the present, they will eternally. They’re just evil people.' Harper, 23, met Lane, 22, when he came to America on a baseball scholarship and they have been dating for the past four years. The couple had just returned from visiting his native country three days before he was shot during his daily jog. Loss: Harper and Lane had just returned from Australia three days before his death . ‘Most people will go to college and try to find who they are on their own, like away from parents and all that but I found it with Chris and he really helped me,’ Ms Harper told Australia’s Herald Sun. ‘Luckily I got most of his time in the last four years…its helpful thinking back on those and not dwelling on all of this. ‘I talk to his family daily- whether its cousins, sisters or parents- and I wish that they find some kind of comfort to help them heal.’ In a Facebook post about her boyfriend's death, Ms Harper wrote that their time together had been 'the most amazing of my life'. 'I love you so much babe. From 2009 until forever you will always be mine and in a very special and protected place in my heart.' 'It's a very angry yet extremely sad time. No one deserves to die that way. Not even the boys involved. 'Don't get me wrong, I want them to rot in hell, but no one should be blindly taken from the back so unexpectedly and without any reason.' Promising student: Lane was in the United States on a baseball scholarship and the pair had been dating since 2009 . Sweethearts: Sarah Harper has been left heartbroken after her boyfriend Chris Lane was gunned down in a senseless killing on Friday . Not all Australians are being supportive like Lane’s family, as former Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer called for his fellow countrymen to think of this shooting when they are planning a trip to the United States. 'People (who) are thinking of going to the USA on business, vacation, trips, should think carefully about it given the statistical facts you are 15 times more likely to be shot dead in the USA than in Australia per capita per million people,' he told CNN's Piers Morgan. 'Just for the record, Australia has had zero gun massacres since 1996, and in the United States, 80 people are killed by guns every single day. 'So, it is another example of murder and mayhem on Main Street.' For America's part, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said that the federal government is 'deeply saddened' by Lane's death but she did not comment on any specific action. Grieving: Sarah Harper visits a memorial of flowers and mementos that has been created at the spot where he was shot and killed on Friday . Charged: James Edwards (right) and Chancey Luna (center) face first degree murder charges while Michael Jones (left) is charged as an accessory for allegedly driving the car . 'This is clearly a tragic death, and we extend our condolences to the family and the loved ones. We understand that local authorities are focused on bringing those responsible to justice. Clearly, we would support that,' she said at a briefing on Tuesday. The three teens accused in the murder- James Edwards, 15, and Chancey Luna, 16, who are charged with first degree murder and Michael Jones, 17, who is charged as an accessory for driving the getaway car- are all being held on bail. District Attorney Jason Hicks told the press inside the Oklahoma courthouse that he is 'going to do everything I can to ensure these three thugs pay for what they did to Christopher Lane'. Smitten: The couple had been together since 2009. Sarah Harper described their time as 'the most amazing of my life' Together: Harper said that she was lucky to have spent so much of the last four years with Lane . Though all three are being tried as adults and a first degree murder charge in Oklahoma can come with a death penalty, they will not face the prospect of execution because of their age. ‘I don't want them to have any future that Chris wasn't able to have as well,’ Ms Harper said, according to The Herald Sun. ‘It's been pretty rough. It's been hard knowing he was taken so close to home, let alone taken in the way he was. To be pointed out like that.’ Ms Harper said that unbeknownst to her, Lane’s family had started raising funds to pay for her flight back to Australia so that she could attend his funeral. ‘I appreciate everything that they've done and I appreciate them sharing him over here with all of us- me in particular,’ she said.","Chris Lane, 22, was in the United States on a baseball scholarship .

Miss Powell, of Orpington, said the interviewer then told her she felt ‘uncomfortable’. But the mother replied: ‘There’s nothing uncomfortable about me breastfeeding my son, it’s natural.’ However the interviewer was said to have told her the breastfeeding was ‘disgusting’, adding: ‘If you do not stop it, I’m terminating this interview’. Miss Powell claimed she put her son’s blanket over him so the Jobcentre woman could not see him feeding - but she was again told it was ‘disgusting’. Miss Powell added: ‘She was raising her voice then she kicked me out and ended the interview. I was crying because she did that to me. She kicked me out for breastfeeding my son. ‘I have never ever felt so embarrassed. She would not have moaned if someone had bottle fed their baby.

She said: ‘We have apologised to Ms Powell for any inconvenience and confusion caused during her visit to the Jobcentre. 'Mothers are welcome to feed their babies when visiting us. This can take place wherever the mother feels comfortable - either in a public area or a private room if one is available.’ A spokesman for We Do It in Public, a campaign group supporting breastfeeding in public, said: ‘Perceptions of breastfeeding in public still continues to be a sticking point for both new and experienced mums who choose to breastfeed. ‘It’s such a shame that as a society we are still seeing cases where people are asked to leave public places, just because they are feeding their baby.’","Tara Powell took four-month-old son Preston to centre in SE London .

Guests at the all-inclusive Sentido Perissia Hotel in Side, have been confined to their rooms because of a mass outbreak of sickness. The father, who was on holiday with his wife and two children, had tests after returning to Britain which revealed he had contracted the E.coli virus. In extreme cases, the infection can kill.

Hospitalised: (From left to right) Shirley Drum, 51, Diane Blumsom, 45, and Pat Bundy, 47, in Akdeniz Hastanesi Manavgat Hospital . The family paid £4,000 for their one-week stay at the luxury resort on the Turkish coast - but the man's wife and one of his children struck down by severe diarrhoea, stomach cramps and vomiting. Lawyers said the man, who has not been identified, still has 'significant symptoms' nearly two weeks after returning home and he is yet to go back to work. Thomas Cook said there has been an outbreak of norovirus at the hotel and the food and hygiene standards are not to blame. They say that their own tests on 144 victims have shown the symptoms were caused by a virus and not a food borne pathogen like E.coli. They also pointed out that none of the Dutch guests staying at the resort have been infected with the implication that the virus has simply been spread amongst the Brits who spent a lot of time around each other. The holiday company have suspended holidays at the resort after guests fell ill. Lawyers also claimed that another guest had been infected by Giardia - a parasite that has been found in the water.

Holiday hell: Hundreds of guests were struck down by illness at the luxury five-star all inclusive Sentido Perissia Hotel in Side, southern Turkey . Nolan Mortimer, a partner at Colemans CTTS solicitors, said they were representing a man who had E.coli. 'Three of the family of four fell ill while staying at the hotel. They have had stool samples taken in the UK and the father has been diagnosed with the E.coli infection,' he said. 'The weight of cases of illness from the hotel is indicative of a significant problem. 'It is difficult to say how many people have been affected but we are looking at dealing with 100 cases of sick people ourselves.' Bacterial infections like E.coli can develop and spread rapidly if there is poor food preparation and hygiene standards. Mr Mortimer is preparing claims for compensation against Thomas Cook. Hundreds of holidaymakers are thought to have fallen ill at the luxury hotel over the last month. Diane Blumsom, 45, from Clacton, Essex, was hospitalised in Turkey after being struck down by the illness. She paid £1,300 to fly herself and her daughters Sian, 18, and nine-year-old Jane, home from their break early. Miss Blumsom, who was on holiday with a party of 20 people, had paid £5,412 for her two-week break. She said: ‘It really was the holiday from hell.

They eventually flew home early . ‘This . place was meant to be a five-star resort but we all asked Thomas Cook . to fly us home because we were so ill we couldn’t use the facilities, . but they refused. ‘We arrived on Saturday August 10 and within two days our party were being struck down by severe sickness. My daughter Jane, who is nine, had projectile vomiting so severe it was like something out of The Exorcist. 'At one point the staff decided they didn’t want the ambulance to keep coming to the hotel so they insisted that people had to get taxis there instead.’ Staff closed down the swimming pool for two days last week as they tried to deal with the outbreak of sickness and diarrhoea. Guest David Corran, 28, who was also staying at the hotel with the party of 20, including his girlfriend Jade Bundy, 22, fell ill within two days of arriving at the hotel. ‘We have been trying to think what we might have eaten but we don’t know,’ he said. ‘It could have been the salad and some thought it might be the water they use to wash the salad. Crisis talks: Sick guests hold a meeting at the hotel to discuss what course of action to take after falling ill . ‘When we complained about falling ill the rep blamed it on the English and said we had too much sun.’ Thomas Cook have flown out hygiene experts to investigate and have been sending guests with bookings to different resorts. Alastair Brass, Thomas Cook director of service and quality, said: 'We know how important holidays are to people and how upsetting it can be when you’re ill overseas. 'Sentido has put extra measures in place to minimise the spread, whilst we moved new arrivals to alternative hotels and immediately sent a UK hygiene expert to carry out comprehensive tests. 'Results indicate the cause is ""viral"", not the hotel’s hygiene standards. 'The Sentido Perissia is popular with British customers enjoying an excellent health and safety record and rates highly in customer satisfaction surveys. 'We’re sorry guests have been unwell and our experienced resort team continue to support those still with the 24-48 hour symptoms.' ‘The health and well-being of our . customers is our top priority and we take all reports of illness very . seriously.

An eleventh woman has accused San Diego mayor Bob Filner of sexually harassing her - claiming he said he would help an Iraq-wounded Marine, in exchange for her having a sexual relationship with him. Nurse Michelle Tyler claims that Filner asked her for a personal relationship - including dinner dates - in exchange for helping wounded U.S. Marine Katherine Ragazzino. The alleged victim told a news conference that Filner - who has been accused by ten other women of harassing them - told her his help depended on her being seen in public with him. Michelle Tyler, center, speaks during a news conference alongside former Marine Katherine Ragazzino, right, and attorney Gloria Allred, left . She said: 'He made it very clear that . his expectation was that his help for Katherine depended on my . willingness to go to dinner with him, spend personal time with him and . be seen in public with him.' Ms . Tyler cares for Ms Ragazzino, who experienced a traumatic brain injury . and post-traumatic stress disorder while serving and has since struggled . to resolve a problem with Veterans Affairs, Politico reported. The . incident allegedly took place on June 11 in the mayor’s office, two . years after Tyler first discussed Ragazzino's care with Filner. After allegedly asking others to leave . the room  asked to spend time with Tyler, the former 10-term . congressman made it clear he wanted to kiss her, and asked whether she . was married and if he could call her. Michelle Tyler alleges San Diego Mayor Bob Filner made inappropriate advances on her while she was seeking help for Marine Katherine Ragazzino (right) Ms Ragazzino said 'I do not appreciate being used as a bargaining chip to fulfill his sexual desires.' Ms Tyler will not be filing a lawsuit against Filner at this time, but her attorney, Gloria Allred has sent a letter to San Diego City Attorney Jan Goldsmith to demand an investigation into the incident. The former congressman is less than eight months into his first four-year term as mayor. Bob Filner is attending therapy following the host of allegations . Eleven women, including a university dean and a retired Navy rear admiral, have gone public with accusations that Filner made unwanted passes. Some contend that he cornered them and made sexual advances that included groping and slobbering kisses. He has begun two weeks of intensive therapy this week while facing a sexual harassment lawsuit and calls for his resignation amid a flurry of allegations that he groped women for years. One accuser, former Filner communications director Irene McCormack Jackson, has filed a harassment lawsuit against him. Even as he undergoes treatment, Filner is set to be grilled by lawyers under oath this week in a lawsuit brought by Ms McCormack Johnson over claims he asked her to work without panties, told her he wanted to see her naked and dragged her around in a headlock while whispering in her ear. Last week the City Council voted 9-0 to deny funds for Filner's legal expenses in the lawsuit. In a bizarre twist, lawyers representing Filner have claimed that if San Diego had provided mandatory sexual harassment training, then Jackson may never have filed the case. The claims suggest that if Filner is found liable in the claim, he could blame his own city council. As reported by NBC 7, in a letter, Filner’s lawyer Harvey Berger, said: 'The City has a legal obligation to provide sexual harassment training to all management level employees. ' The City failed to provide such training to Mayor Filner. 'This is not an excuse for any inappropriate behavior which may have occurred, but I have learned that many – if not most – people do not know what is and what is not illegal sexual harassment under California law.'","Bob Filner 'said he would help Marine in exchange for dates with nurse'

Paramedics drafted in from around the country to cover staff shortages at a scandal-hit ambulance trust are camping in tents because their poor pay means they can't afford to stay in hotels. Many of the agency staff working at East of England Ambulance Service Trust, which has previously come under fire for its poor record at saving lives, live in other parts of the country. But they are given just £35 extra a day on top of their £10.50-an-hour wage to cover the living expenses of working away from home. This has forced many of the medics temporarily working for the trust to camp as they cannot afford the cost of hotels or BnBs. Temporary home: Agency paramedics drafted in to help with staff shortages at the East of England Ambulance Service Trust have been staying at a £15-a-night campsite in Brampton, Cambridgeshire, because their £35 daily living allowance means they can't afford a hotel . Four paramedics - two men and two women - are currently staying in three tents at the Willows campsite in Brampton, Cambridgeshire. The two women are sharing one tent and the two men are in individual tents with each pitch costing £15 per night. They have been recruited on behalf of the ambulance trust by health service contractor ERS Medical. The company said its £35 allowance was 'above the industry norm' and described the camp site as 'great' for their emergency workers. But union leaders said the allowance - to cover food and board while working away - was not enough. Staff are understood to have been using the campsite for the past six weeks, alongside holidaying families who were stunned to see front-line NHS staff living 'rough'. New home: An ambulance worker's uniform is visible in a car parked at the Willows Caravan Park near Brampton in Cambridgeshire . The East of England Ambulance Service Trust service has come under fire for its poor record at saving lives . Holidaymaker Eve Firmin said: 'We were very shocked to see that it was ambulance people that were staying in the tents here. 'We had no idea until we saw one of them come back quite late, make a cup of tea, then head straight to bed.' Health minister Dr Dan Poulter, whose constituency is served by the ambulance trust, said it was no way to look after workers meant to save lives. He said: 'It's something I find very difficult to accept as being good conditions in which to house staff who have patients' lives in their hands. 'This is clearly something the ambulance trust will want to look at immediately as they are responsible for assigning contracts - and they need to do so.' Cambridge Lib-Dem MP Julian Huppert, whose constituency covers the campsite, described the situation as 'astonishing'. He said: 'The contractors charge a . fair whack, I suspect, for the staff, so I would expect they would be . able to make sure they were able to afford to stay somewhere comfortable . while they're working. Criticism: The agency responsible for recruiting the paramedics has come under fire for forcing 'front-line staff who have patients' lives on their hands' to live in campsites . 'Camping can be fun, but it's not great if you have a very late night and want to unwind. 'I think the agency should look very carefully at how much support it's giving its own staff.' A spokesman who represents ambulance workers in the GMB Union said that contractors like ERS have a responsibility to house staff properly. Regional organiser Tony Hughes said: 'ERS have to make sure they have the right resources to do the job. 'The £35 a night figure clearly isn't enough and they need to change the figure. 'It could affect your work if you don't sleep properly, and there's also the hygiene aspect - how well can they shower and keep clean if they go home to a camp site?' But ERS say they have received good feedback on the camp site. An ERS spokesman said: 'We always provide suitable financial support to ensure that all crews have sufficient rest between shifts. Positive feedback: ERS, a health service contractor who recruited the paramedics on behalf of the trust, said the Willows Caravan Park near Brampton in Cambridgeshire was 'great' for their staff . 'We have specifically questioned our . crews as to the suitability of the campsite and have received . unequivocal responses that say it's a great site with appropriate . facilities and that they enjoy good sleep and comfort. They are not at . risk.' The East of England Ambulance Service Trust said: 'The quality of our service delivery is of utmost importance so before working in partnership with us, private ambulance organisations must undergo a thorough trust-accredited process and meet stringent criteria. 'Those who are employed by the private ambulance services are qualified to recognised NHS standard.' Paramedics working for the contractor are paid £10.50 an hour - roughly equivalent to a £21,000-a-year salary. A Premier Inn near the camp site has a starting rate of £57, while the camp site costs just £15 per tent pitch. Campsite manager Ray Jackson said: 'The ambulance workers are no different to the other contractors here - we've had electricians, joiners and demolition men who all prefer camping to a B&B. 'It's up to then how they use their allowance.' Nothing out of the ordinary: Willows Caravan Park manager Ray Jackson said they often have contractors stay at the campsite - including electricians, joiners and now paramedics .","East of England Ambulance Service Trust has taken on temporary agency paramedics to cover staff shortages .

When we look for the ideal holiday destination, one of the most important factors must surely be what sort of welcome we are likely to receive from the locals. So travellers will be delighted by a new list which ranks the friendliest cities in the world - as well as naming and shaming the least friendly. It turns out that the most welcoming places are in famously chilled-out countries such as Brazil, Australia and the mountain kingdom of Bhutan. By contrast, the U.S. dominated the list of the least friendly cities, along with Africa and the Middle East, with Newark, New Jersey crowned the most hostile destination. Bleak: Newark, New Jersey, is known mostly for its airport and has been named the world's least friendly city . Danger: The terror-wracked city of Islamabad is also not thought to be a very friendly place to visit . The lists emerged from the annual Readers' Choice survey compiled by Condé Nast Traveler, reflecting the opinions of thousands of jetset readers. In . addition to the global rankings of friendly and unfriendly cities, the . magazine has put together a list of the friendliest American . communities, with the South taking most of the top spots. The 'winner' of the competition for . the least friendly global city was Newark, which is known more for its . airport than any other attractions. One . reader polled said: 'I visited Newark on business and would not . recommend this city for anything, except a cheaper/less busy airport to . fly into while visiting other cities.' Protests: Oakland, California is a hotbed of radicalism which frequently erupts into violence . Slums: Luanda, the capital of Angola, is another city said to be distinctly unfriendly . Other . American cities in the top 10 included Oakland, California, New Haven, . Connecticut and Detroit, Michigan - as well as New Jersey's Atlantic . City, which despite being a casino resort was denounced as 'a pale . shadow of Las Vegas'. Most . of the rest of the list was made up of cities which are not usually . thought of as popular tourist destinations, such as Islamabad in . Pakistan, Angola's capital Luanda, Kuwait City and Lome, Togo. The friendliest city of all, . according to the survey, is Florianopolis, in southern Brazil, a seaside . community located on an island and packed with historic colonial . architecture. The city . is known as the 'Island of Magic', while visitors reported that locals . were keen to offer expert advice on how best to make use of their time . there. Friendly: Florianopolis in Brazil has been named the most welcoming city in the world . Runner-up: Hobart, in the Australian state of Tasmania, is the second friendliest city in the world . Next is Hobart, capital of the . Australian state of Tasmania, which is one of three cities Down Under to . make the top 10 of the list, along with Queenstown in New Zealand and . Margaret River, Western Australia. Another country to have multiple entries in the list is Bhutan, a tiny country in the Himalayas between China and India. The . nation's king has a policy of boosting 'gross national happiness' rather than economic output - and it appears to have paid off, with the . cities of Thimpu and Paro both named among the 10 friendliest in the . world. Perhaps more . surprisingly, Mandalay in Burma also made the list - even though the . country is currently emerging from decades of brutal military . dictatorship. The . only British city to appear in the top 20 was Edinburgh, at no. 18, . although Ireland did rather better as Kilkenny, Dublin and Cork were all . named among the world's friendliest.

Arrested: Jason Lee, 37, was charged with first-degree rape after a 20-year-old woman claimed he assaulted her . A top Goldman Sachs banker has been arrested on charges that he raped a 20-year-old woman at a $33,000-a-month summer house he rented in the Hamptons with his wife. Jason Lee, 37, was charged with first-degree rape on Wednesday. Police allege that he assaulted the woman during a naked pool party at the home in East Hampton on Long Island, New York. Lee, the managing director for the Goldman Sachs group that handles the initial public offerings, pleaded not guilty. His lawyer said he is innocent and is looking forward to clearing his name. He is on leave from his job at Goldman following his arrest. The East Hampton Star reports that the alleged victim was a guest at Lee's summer house during a party Monday night. A police source told the newspaper that there was 'nudity involved' at the pool party. Sometime that evening or early Tuesday, police allege, Lee raped the young woman. The party was being held at a four-bedroom mansion Lee and his wife had rented for the summer. This is the house on Clover Leaf Lane in East Hampton, New York, where the sexual assault allegedly occurred . The New York Times reports that the mansion was listed for $33,000 a month.

Yesterday at The Ritz hotel in London, the Professor Clive Palmer show rolled into town.  And what a show. He is still relatively unknown in this country, but surely not for long. For Prof Palmer is the Australian businessman who is going to bring back the Titanic... or at least a modern-day  replica of it. Unveiling his plans for Titanic II, the ebullient mining magnate insisted the new ship will set sail in 2016, and dismissed his doubters with a single word. Professor Palmer thinks that the Titanic II will be up and running as soon as possible, despite the high cost . The Cafe de Parisien, decorated with intricate woodwork, will provide guests with a relaxing area to socialise during the day . ‘B******t,’ he said to those who questioned whether he would ever make his dream a reality. ‘This is not a fantasy, this is not a movie. This is going to happen,’ he added. Titanic II will seek to closely match the design of original vessel, which sank on the fifth day of its maiden voyage in April 1912, killing more than 1,500 passengers and crew. It will boast the same interiors, and even the same onboard gymnasium, complete with Edwardian exercise machines. The grand staircase, smoking room, Cafe Parisien and various dining rooms will also be recreated, as will the reading and writing room, the swimming pool and Moorish-influenced Turkish baths. The third class dining room gives an authentic experience of riding on the ship. Tickets allowing you to experience all three classes will be available . The Turkish baths will be the height of luxury on the £400million replica ship . There will be an authentic Edwardian gym complete with equipment that guests can use . There will not be televisions or state-of-the-art music systems on board, nor internet connections or   mobile phones. But every passenger will find period costumes in their cabin wardrobe so that they can enjoy ‘a true 1912 experience’. However, the plans include a safety deck (with more lifeboats obviously), a new high-tech engine, air-conditioning and service lifts. As with the original ship, there will be First, Second and Third Class cabins and passengers will not be allowed to mingle – apart from on the safety deck, where there will be a casino and theatre. Clive Palmer, who made his money in iron ore, is determined to get the project up and running as soon as possible . And at 883ft, Titanic II will be three inches longer than its predecessor to accommodate an additional area at the bow where passengers will be able to recreate the iconic ‘Jack and Rose pose’ made famous by actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in James Cameron’s 1997 Oscar-winning movie. Cameron refused Palmer’s invitation to last week’s Titanic II celebratory gala dinner in New York. Another . dinner was held last night at London’s Natural History Museum, where . guests were served the same 11 course dinner as First-Class passengers . on the original. Speaking . to The Mail on Sunday yesterday, Prof Palmer said he would travel Third . Class on his  ship’s maiden voyage – ‘Although I’ll probably nip up to . First or the bridge as we come into New York harbour,’ he said. ‘Third Class has got all the appeal, but there might be people who normally travel Third Class who might want to go in First.’ Known as the man who got rich under . the radar, Palmer was born in Melbourne to Nancy and George Palmer, a . silent movie star of the 1920s who went on to set up the first . commercial radio stations in Australia. Clive made his first millions . investing in property on Australia’s Gold Coast but became . eye-wateringly rich after moving into iron ore mining. His net worth is the subject of much . debate. Business Review Weekly rates Palmer as Australia’s fifth-richest . person with assets of $5 billion (about £3.5 billion) while Forbes . estimates his wealth at a relatively paltry $895 million (£600 million). Palmer contends he is far wealthier . than even the BRW estimate. He refuses to say how much Titanic II will . cost to build, although   experts believe it will between £260 million . and £400 million. While the original was built in . Belfast, this ship will be constructed in a Chinese yard, and the voyage . could become a financial bonanza for Palmer. But . he says: ‘My motivation   wasn’t to make a lot of money but was . actually to deliver the ship. Now something which wasn’t primarily aimed . in my mind as a great business transaction may well become one.’ An example of a berth in the new Titanic II. Visitors will be able to either spend all six days in one class, or spend two days in each to get the full experience . The will be a non-operational radio control room similar to the one that would have sent out the distress call on the original Titanic . The Titanic II's plans showing how the ship differs from the original. There will be more lifeboats and advanced safety equipment on board . Passengers will be able to buy a six-day ticket for one class, or a mixed ticket covering two days in each section. Prices have not been set yet although Palmer says he has already had offers from 16 people of between £500,000 and £850,000 for berths. ‘That’s not the sort of figure we’ll be asking but it shows the demand,’ he says, adding that 40,000 people have expressed an interest on his website bluestarline.com – an homage to the original Titanic operating company, the White Star Line. ‘The Titanic II is about falling in love with your wife all over again or her falling in love with you. It’s about going back to a different time,’ he says.","Professor Clive Palmer unveiled plans for a Titanic II .

A couple accused of plotting to abduct, torture and kill police to further their anti-authority ‘sovereign citizens’ movement told a Las Vegas judge today that they didn't recognize his authority to keep them in jail. Justice of the Peace Conrad Hafen had none of it. He made sure David Allen Brutsche, 42, and Devon Campbell Newman, 67, read the criminal complaints filed against them, then sent them back to jail pending a September 9 preliminary hearing on charges of felony conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to commit kidnapping and attempted kidnapping. Day in court: Devon Newman (left), 67, and David Brutsche (right), 42, were brought before a judge Friday following their arrest for allegedly plotting to kill and torture police officers . Rebel: Brutsche, who calls himself a 'sovereign citizen,' told Justice of the Peace Conrad Hafen that he does not recognize his authority . Plea for freedom: Newman asked the judge to release her on bail because she did not hurt anyone, but her request was denied . Police say Brutsche and Newman held training sessions about sovereign citizen philosophy, shopped for guns, found a vacant house and rigged it to bind captives to cross beams during interrogation, and recorded videos to explain their actions and why officers had to die. The judge appointed a public defender to represent Brutsche, over his rambling objections, and set bail at $600,000, citing a criminal history including a sex offense involving a child under 14 and failure to appear in traffic cases. ‘I object to the entire proceedings of this court. For the record,’ Brutsche said. Hafen named a lawyer to represent Newman and scheduled her bail hearing for Monday. ‘I've hurt no one. I wish to be released on bail,’ Newman said. ‘So noted,’ the judge responded. ‘Denied.' Brutsche and Newman were arrested Thursday in a sting operation at an apartment a few miles off the Vegas Strip before they could carry out a plan to snatch officers, 'put them on trial' and execute them in a vacant house, police Lt. James Seebock said. Federal authorities regard sovereign citizen extremists as domestic terrorists. 'Domestic terrorists': Brutsche (left) and Newman were arrested in a sting operation Thursday . Authorities have linked sovereign citizens groups with violent confrontations in recent years, including deadly shootings in Louisiana and Arkansas. Brutsche, 42, and Newman, 67, wanted to draw attention to the group's rejection of governmental authority, making the case a domestic terror plot, Seebock said. 'They were furthering their ''sovereign citizen'' ideology by committing criminal acts toward law enforcement,' he said. The investigation began when an unidentified undercover officer befriended Brutsche and Newman in April, police said. Radical views: Brutsche allegedly stated last month that 'sovereign citizens' need to arrest the police, throw them in jail and put them on trial in a people's court . ‘The suspects believed that once the first kidnapping and execution was accomplished, they would be compelled to keep repeating their actions, kidnapping and killing multiple officers.’ The three participated in meetings and training sessions about sovereign citizen philosophy and later shopped for guns and discussed plans to track and videotape police officers to determine whom to abduct, according to a 10-page arrest report. They found a vacant house and rigged it with bolts drilled into wall supports, creating a makeshift jail where they planned to bind captive officers to cross beams for interrogation, police said. Authorities haven't released video . evidence, but the report states that Brutsche and Newman recorded videos . about their actions and ideology to post following the planned . abductions. Hundreds of hours of conversation were recorded over the course of 30 meetings with the undercover officer, police said. 'We . need to arrest the police and take them to our jail and put them in a . cell and put them on trial in a people's court,' Brutsche said on July . 9, according to the arrest report. 'If we run into the position that they resist, then we need to kill them.' During . a tour of gun stores the next day, Brutsche said that what they were . planning was going to be big, 'and that they would really get a large . following once they started because of the publicity,' the report said. Police said that when Brutsche was arrested, he denied that police had authority to hold him. Plot: The pair had were arrested near the Vegas strip after planning to rig a vacant house with a makeshift jail . Police identified Brutsche as a six-time convicted felon and child sex offender from California. Authorities did not detail a further criminal background for Newman. In Louisiana last year, police linked a sovereign citizen group to shootout that left two deputies dead and two others wounded. At least some of the seven people arrested were identified as sovereign citizen members. In Arkansas in 2010, a father and son identified as members of the group shot and killed two police officers before being killed by authorities in a separate shootout. ‘This is a serious concern, especially when it comes to law enforcement,’ said Heidi Beirich, director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Alabama. She said seven police officers had been killed in the past 10 years during traffic stop confrontations with sovereign citizen adherents, including a sheriff's deputy and constable killed in 2003 in Abbeyville, South Carolina, and a California Highway Patrol officer slain in Alamo last September. ‘The basic argument is the federal government has no power over them,’ Beirich said. ‘It becomes, at the end of the day, ""We hate the government and the government has no right to tell us what to do.""'","David Allen Brutsche and Devon Campbell Newman were arrested over 'domestic terrorism' plot in Las Vegas .

The last year has seen prices for budget airlines soaring, as added fees for checked luggage and allocated seating have become an even more costly caveat to low air fares. In many cases, 'low-cost' flights will match the cost of full-service airlines once these extra charges are taken into account. But if you're planning a long trip and don't fancy paying through the nose if your bag weighs a whisker over 15kgs (you'll pay £20 for every kilo you go over with Ryanair), help is at hand. The budget airlines' restrictions on baggage have been getting tighter, while charges for going over the agreed weight have been rising steeply . EasyJet and Ryanair often offer low starting prices but then add costs on for services such as checking in bags and priority seating . First Luggage has launched a service which allows you to bypass the baggage carousel altogether. The company, which works with couriers Fed-Ex, will pick your suitcase up at your door and transport it to your chosen destination, cutting out the need to take bags to the airport altogether. Pick-up and delivery within Europe costs . from £49 for sports equipment to £85 for a 30kg bag, while transporting . items to the USA starts from £99. You can even track your bag along its journey. You skip not only check-in, but the fraught weigh-in - and those pesky trolleys with a mind of their own. It doesn't make sense if you're just . popping to Paris for the weekend, but if you've got a big family holiday . coming up and need to bring a ton of stuff with you, you could save . yourself money - and hassle. Jet-setters Simon Cowell and Cheryl Cole use the service, while Joan Collins is a big fan: 'First Luggage picks up the cases from my home, hotel or wherever . I am and magically whisks them to the next port of call.' This year has seen checked luggage fees soar across the board. Ryanair raised the cost of hold luggage from 30 euros to 50 euros (£43.60) for the summer. Chairman Michael O'Leary told a conference in London this week that charges for checked-in luggage 'will keep increasing until we get rid of the bags'. An annual study by TravelSupermarket, . the price comparison website, revealed the extent to which budget . airlines' fees for 'optional' services, including checked luggage, had . risen. Ryanair Chairman Michael O'Leary told a conference in London this week that charges for checked-in luggage 'will keep increasing until we get rid of the bags'. Thomson's baggage charges have gone up by 47 per cent since 2012, from £15 per person per flight to £22, while easyJet's equivalent fee has increased by a quarter, from £14.50 to £18. Ryanair, Flybe and Jet2 have all raised their baggage fees by at least 10 per cent. The cost to check in an overweight item of hand luggage has also increased on several airlines: from £30 to £50 with Monarch (up 67 per cent), from £30 to £40 with Flybe (up 33 per cent), and from £130 to £140 with Ryanair (up 8 per cent). The problem is a global one, with the top 15 airlines in the US collecting baggage fees totaling $3.5 billion (£2.3 billion) in 2012 alone.","Some airlines have increased the cost 47 per cent in the last year .

Staff Sergeant Robert Bales became emotional during testimony in which he said he was angry and afraid when he went on a solo nighttime mission and slaughtered villagers, mostly women and children, on March 11, 2012 in their huts. 'What I did is an act of cowardice,' he said. 'I'm a mass of fear and bullshit and bravado. I'm truly, truly sorry to those people whose families got taken away.' Scroll down for video . Sorry: Courtroom sketch shows Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales on the stand, saying he thinks about his victims and their families 'every time I look at my kids' during a hearing in Tacoma, Washington, August 22, 2013 . Bales, 39, pleaded guilty in June in a deal to avoid the death penalty for the attacks. A military jury will determine if his life sentence should offer a chance of parole. Bales said he was mad at himself for being angry all the time, drinking too much and hiding his problems. He added that he thinks of the families 'every time I look at my kids.' Bales was nervous when he took the stand as the final witness in the hearing at which his lawyers have tried to paint a sympathetic picture of the soldier to contrast his own admissions and the testimony of angry Afghan villagers about the horror he wrought. Former pro football player Marc Edwards testified as a character witness, telling jurors he remembered Bales as a great leader from their high school days in Norwood, Ohio. Sentencing: Courtroom sketch shows Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales on the stand in his defense under questioning by his civilian attorney Emma Scanlan, right, as judge Army Colonel Jeffery Nance, center, looks on on Thursday . Wearing the Super Bowl ring he won . with the New England Patriots in 2002, Edwards said the slightly older . Bales was an 'unbelievable leader' who 'took me under his wing' on their . high school team. Bales was even magnanimous when Edwards took his position at starting linebacker, he said. 'He . came up to me after that practice kind of sheepishly,' said Edwards, . who played nine years in the NFL. 'He says, ""Hey Marc ... I want the . team to be successful.""' The . jurors on Thursday also heard from an Army officer who served with . Bales in Iraq. Major Brent Clemmer said it was unfathomable to learn . that the competent, positive soldier he knew could have committed the . atrocity. 'I walked myself into my office, poured myself a glass of scotch, and cried,' he said. A brother of the soldier testified at . Bales' sentencing hearing, on Wednesday, portraying him as a patriotic . American, high school class president and football team captain. Victim: In this courtroom sketch, an Afghan man named Faizullah, about 30 years old, testifies about how his father, Haji Mohammad Naim, and brother Sadiquallah were shot and wounded when Staff Sgt. Robert Bales attacked their village in Kandahar Province . Pained: In this courtroom sketch, Haji Mohammad Naim testifies Tuesday, August 20, 2013, about how Bales attacked his village and one other in pre-dawn raids on March 11, 2012, killing 16 civilians . 'There's no better father that I've seen,' William Bales, 55, said of his younger brother. 'If you brought the kids in here today, they'd run right to him.' William Bales repeatedly referred to his sibling — once the captain of his high school football team and class president in Norwood, Ohio, where they grew up — as 'my baby brother' and 'Bobby.' He described how as a teenager his brother cared for a developmentally disabled neighborhood boy, assisting him with basic life functions. The neighbor's father also testified about Bales' helpfulness. 'I don't know too many 16-, 17-year-old boys who could do that,' William Bales said. On Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning, nine Afghan villagers who traveled about 7,000 miles to testify at the hearing in traditional garb spoke of their lives since the attacks. Haji Mohammad Wazir lost 11 family members, including his mother, wife and six of his seven children. Supporters: A brother of the soldier, pictured in 2011, testified at Bales' sentencing hearing, on Wednesday, portraying him as a patriotic American, high school class president and football team captain . He told the six-member jury that the attacks destroyed what had been a happy life. He was in another village with his youngest son, now 5-year-old Habib Shah, during the attack. 'If someone loses one child, you can imagine how devastated their life would be,' said Wazir, who received $550,000 in condolence payments from the U.S. government, out of $980,000 paid in all. 'If anybody speaks to me about the incident ... I feel the same, like it's happening right now.' His son, now 5, 'misses everyone. He hasn't forgotten any of them.' 'I've gone through very hard times,' he added. Wazir and a cousin, Khamal Adin, didn't get to say everything they wanted to in court. Each asked for permission to speak after the prosecutors' questions were finished, but the judge said it wasn't allowed. Two military doctors testified Wednesday, describing the treatment of Bales' victims, including a young girl who had been shot in the head and spent three months undergoing surgeries and rehabilitation at a naval hospital in San Diego, relearning how to walk. Rampage: Bales, right, a father of two from Lake Tapps, Washington, was serving his fourth combat deployment when he attacked the two villages solo . Bales' attorneys, who have said the soldier suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, didn't cross-examine any of the Afghan witnesses. Bales, a father of two from Lake Tapps, Washington, was serving his fourth combat deployment when he left the outpost at Camp Belambay in the pre-dawn darkness. He first attacked one village, returning to Belambay only when he realized he was low on ammunition, said prosecutor Lieutenant Colonel Jay Morse. Bales then left to attack another village. The massacre prompted such angry protests that the U.S. temporarily halted combat operations, and it was three weeks before Army investigators could reach the crime scene. If he is sentenced to life with the possibility of parole, Bales would be eligible in 20 years, but there's no guarantee he would receive it. He will receive life with parole unless at least five of the six jurors say otherwise.","Staff Sergeant Robert Bales described his killing spree as an 'act of cowardice' on Thursday as he testified in his sentencing at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington .

An Australian baseball player who was allegedly shot and killed at random while he was jogging wasn't targeted because of his race or nationality, the prosecutor in charge of the case has said. Christopher Lane, a 22-year-old student at East Central University, was shot in the back and killed last week while jogging in Duncan, Oklahoma where the three teenagers accused in his killing live. 'At this point, the evidence does not support the theory that Christopher Lane was targeted based upon his race or nationality,' District Attorney Jason Hicks said in a statement on Friday. Hicks acknowledged that social media posts allegedly made by some of the defendants are racial in nature, but he said 'the evidence is insufficient to establish that race was the primary motive' in Lane's slaying. Killed: Christopher Lane, a baseball player and student who was shot dead as he went jogging, was not targeted due to his race or nationality, the prosecutor in charge of the case has said . Chancey Allen Luna, 16, and James Francis Edwards, Jr., 15, have been charged as adults with first-degree murder. Michael Dewayne Jones, 17, is charged with using a vehicle in the discharge of a weapon and with accessory to first-degree murder. He is considered a youthful offender but will be tried in adult court. Police said Jones told investigators that the three were 'bored' and decided to kill someone for the 'fun of it'. One of Edwards' friends, Serenity Jackson, told The Associated Press she didn't believe race was a factor in the shooting. She noted that Luna's mother, Edwards' girlfriend and Jones are white. Suspects: Michael Jones (left) is accused of being an accessory to murder while Chancey Luna (center) and James Edwards (right) face first degree murder charges for the shooting of Christopher Lane . Questionable: Friends claimed Edwards (center) and Luna (right) were trying to join the local chapter . of the notorious Crips gang, and they posted pictures to their Facebook . where they are holding gang signs . 'It has nothing to do with Chris being white. They didn't even know who he was,' said Jackson, 17, who grew up with Edwards. It had previously emerged that Edwards . had posted on his Twitter profile that he 'hated white people' and . boasted that . he beat up five white people - using the derogatory term 'woods' - . after the George Zimmerman acquittal in the Trayvon Martin case. 'Ayeee I knocced out 5 woods since Zimmerman court!:) lol sh*t ima keep sleepin sh*t! #ayeeee,' he wrote. In another, he said: '90% of white ppl are nasty. #HATE THEM'. But Duncan Police Chief Danny Ford said that . rather than being part of any gang, which had been suggested before, . authorities believe the boys were just wannabes who were emulating the . thuggish beliefs of their idols, with Chief Keef being prime suspect. Remembered: Bob Gregg, a professor in the religion department at Oklahoma Christian University, bows his head as he leads the audience in prayer during the memorial service for Lane on Saturday . Support: Friends Jordan Corn, left, and Sam Moon embrace before the memorial service on Saturday . Struggle: Tyler Iago is comforted by his friend, Sam Moon, of Australia as he weeps at the end of the service . It emerged that the day before . Edwards is alleged to have shot dead Christopher in a drive-by from . a black Ford Focus, he tweeted about rapper Chief Keef. Two . days earlier he posted a chilling tweet that was a lyric from the . rapper's song I Don't Like. It read: 'With my n****s when it's time to . start taken life's' (sic). Other lyrics in the same song include 'pistol . toting and I'm shooting on sight'. Ford said: 'These boys were more into . some rapper that goes around, his music is violent. More than gang . stuff. One of the parents said something about rap. 'These . boys have no respect for life or authority or society, it doesn't . matter who it is. By one of their own words, they saw him go by, and . they said, ""there's the target"" and they followed him and shot him. He . could have been anybody walking down the street.' Tough guy: Edwards posted videos of him tossing around guns and looking threatening in a blue bandana associated with the notorious Crips gang . Random: Police chief Danny Ford said 'it could have been anybody' who was killed that day. But it was Chris Lane (left) and his girlfriend Sarah Harper has talked of her heartbreak at the 'senseless' killing . The boys also posted pictures of themselves doing gang signs with their hands, pretending to use wads of cash as telephones and posing with guns in social media videos. Victim: Chris Lane, 22, was visiting his girlfriend's family in Duncan, Oklahoma when he was killed . Edwards also changed his profile picture on August 9 to show his face hidden in a blue bandana - typically associated with the Crips and its affiliates - and they are active in Oklahoma. Four Crips were indicted on drugs charges in Tulsa in June. But Detective John Byers, who is leading the investigation and is the town's gang expert, told MailOnline: 'Jones, the white gentleman, I've not known him to be claiming to be part of any gang. 'On Edward's posts he is throwing up hand signs, but I haven't known him to say he's part of any gang - and we have no knowledge of Luna being involved with the other two before at all. 'I cannot say this is a gang. They knew each other, they hung out. they committed crime. Yes, by classification, to be called a gang, they have to have some kind of initiation and call themselves a certain name, but at this point I can't say they are a gang. 'Social media has played a large part of this investigation.' Officials believe that Lane was not their first target, though he was their first human victim. Police . chief Ford said that during their investigation they found a dead . donkey that had been killed with a shotgun just a block away from where . Lane was murdered. Shock: Residents of Duncan have been convulsed by the murder that has attracted worldwide attention . The small town has been rocked by the . senseless murder that has sent shockwaves around the world, leaving many . wondering what drove the 'bored' boys to apparently kill just for the . thrill of it.

A ban on 'Nazis' attending a Second World War-themed event celebrating the Dambusters anniversary failed to stop people strutting around in SS uniform over the weekend. Organisers of the 1940s Weekend at Haworth, West Yorkshire, faced complaints last year from a party of German tourists about the flaunting of regalia linked to the Holocaust. This year figures wearing leather . coats and uniforms featuring the 'Death’s Head' insignia of the SS camp . guards were again spotted among the crowds. Sensitive issue: Men in Luftwaffe (centre) and Wehrmacht (right) uniform at the Haworth 1940s event. Organisers asked attendees not to wear the controversial garb . Businesses in the town were given signs saying 'No Nazi or SS Insignia or Uniform on these premises' for this year's event. The man in the centre is dressed in Luftwaffe . Signs warning 'No Nazi or SS Insignia or uniforms on these premises' were displayed on shops, pubs and camp sites. Haworth is a tourist hotspot because of its links with the Bronte family and this year organisers were determined to avoid a repeat of last year’s controversy. Businesses all over the town, were given signs saying Nazi or SS uniforms 'not welcome' in a bid to avoid 'unnecessary offence'. A participant wearing an SS hat at this year's event . But again the event – which attracts 25,000 visitors a year and raises thousands of pounds for charity – was marred by visitors dressing up as members of Hitler’s elite SS. As well as being notorious for their ruthlessness, the SS also guarded the concentration camps. One of the weekend organisers, Emma Cox, said those involved were getting more stubborn about flaunting their regalia every year. She said: 'This is a very controversial issue. Lots of people who come to the weekend are re-enactors recreating military, civilian, and other features of the era. 'Then there are people who come as spectators who are mainly local people but some from further afield. 'Every year there are a few people who come in SS Uniforms which is nothing to do with the re-enactments. 'It is just about getting dressed up as SS people. 'Some people find this quite upsetting in what is meant to be a celebration of the Home Front spirit. 'Apart from anything there would not have been any SS in England at the time. 'These people who come dressed as SS have been getting very uptight that other people do not want them to come. 'They seem to be getting more determined to get dressed up in their SS uniforms and this is an open and public event. 'So it is just not appropriate – or practical – to vet the thousands of people coming into the village. 'It is okay to come dressed as a German soldier. But everyone knows the SS was different. They were the people running the concentration camps. 'It’s a problem because this is a public event which is supposed to be inclusive.' The 1940s weekend is an annual Second World War-themed event that has been running for 18 years . Bronte Society Chairman Sally . McDonald said: 'It is regrettable if they have attended in those sort of . costumes. It is a tremendous weekend that brings all of Haworth . together. 'So if offence is caused it more than . unfortunate. It casts a bit of a shadow over what is a hugely . successful weekend which raises a tremendous amount for charity. 'The people who organise it want to . raise the profile of Haworth and raise money for charity. It brings in . huge numbers of visitors to Haworth. If not everyone is in the correct . spirit of the weekend that is most regrettable. 'The traders of Haworth put polite notices in the weekend asking people not to don these outfits. 'Let's hope in the future everyone respects what is being done and has fun in the right way.' Attendees are allowed to wear German military uniforms, but the SS is a sensitive matter because of their links to genocide and other horrific war crimes .

Right, six-year-old Arron Lydon with a group of Land Girls . Organisers have said there is no law against wearing the uniforms so it was not possible to impose an outright ban. This year’s event was particularly sensitive since it was taking place on the 70th anniversary of the Dambuster’s raid and included a Dambuster's theme. All proceeds raised from the weekend will be donated to the armed forces charity, the Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen's Families Association. It is hoped to match or exceed the £25,000 raised last year for Help for Heroes. A member of the SS prepares to shoot a Polish Jew . Founded in 1925, the 'Schutzstaffel', German for 'Protective Echelon', initially served as Nazi Party leader Adolf Hitler's personal bodyguards, later becoming one of the most powerful and feared organizations in all of Nazi Germany. Heinrich Himmler, a militant anti-Semite, became head of the SS in 1929 and expanded the group's role and size.Recruits had to prove their 'racial purity' and were also taught they were the not only the elite of Nazi Party but also of all humankind. By the start of the Second World War the SS had more than 250,000 members and multiple subdivisions, engaged in activities ranging from intelligence operations to running Nazi concentration camps. The soldiers of the SS committed many atrocities during World War II. The concentration camp system was set up in the 1930s by Theodor Eicke of the SS. Thousands of SS men were also drafted to help exterminate the Jews of Eastern Europe, participating in mass killings or guarding ghetto districts where Jews from the west were concentrated before being sent to death camps. They played a major role in the mass murders in the Warsaw Ghetto in 1943.Jews were routinely executed or maltreated in areas controlled by SS units.At the end of the war many leading members of the SS committed suicide. Those that were captured were tried at the Nuremburg war crimes trials.","The event had people dressed as the notorious SS, despite a ban .

Graham Brady, chairman of the influential backbench 1992 Committee, called on David Cameron and Education Secretary Michael Gove to support selective education . Senior Tory MPs demanded a return of grammar schools in England yesterday after the Conservatives in Wales announced that they will bring them back if they win the next Assembly election. Graham Brady, chairman of the influential backbench 1992 Committee, called on David Cameron and Education Secretary Michael Gove to support selective education where there are currently no grammar schools. And he said existing selective schools should be allowed to expand further. There are no remaining grammar schools in Wales and only 164 in England. David Cameron has angered many of his backbenchers by refusing to overturn a ban introduced by Labour on new grammar schools. But in a challenge to the leadership, Welsh Tories threw down the gauntlet by proposing plans for children to undergo academic selection at 14 - rather than the old 11 plus - choosing whether to continue with rigorous academic subjects or concentrate on technical or practical courses. Mr Brady, who resigned from the Tory frontbench in 2007 after Mr Cameron said he would not support more Grammar Schools, said his party should do more for parents in England who don’t want to have to pay for selective schools. He told the Mail: ‘I’m delighted to see colleagues in Wales thinking so creatively about ways to improve standards of state education. 'In England Michael Gove has done an enormous amount to increase choice and diversity in state schools. ‘I hope we will also be prepared to look at ways of freeing up schools in areas that don’t currently have grammar schools to introduce academic selection. 'Everybody accepts that selection is necessary at 16 before people go on to sit A-Levels. There’s no reason in principle why selection at 14 shouldn’t be tried. Popular: The proportion of secondary school pupils in grammars is at its highest level since 1978 . ‘In England the government celebrates the success of our existing grammar schools and is happy to allow them to expand or set up annexes in areas which already have grammar schools. 'There is a massive and unfulfilled demand for the rigour of academic selection in other parts of the country where current laws, introduced by Labour, prevent parents having the option of grammar schools in the state sector.’ David Davies, the Tory MP for Monmouth, also voiced support for the plans. He said: ‘Bring back grammar schools! Hope the Tory party in London [is] listening to what we are saying in Wales.’ His colleague Glyn Davies said he ‘loves the UK impact’ of the Welsh announcement. Angela Burns, the Conservative shadow minister for education in Wales, declared: ‘It is time we put the Grammar back into education and Wales has just that perfect opportunity. She said: ‘We could see the benefit of creating two equitable streams of education, one alongside the other, a dualing that begins at 14 - giving children the chance to develop important core subject skills before embarking on their chosen path.’ The law states that no new selective schools can open with state funding. But the existing grammars have been expanding and taking on new pupils. The proportion of secondary school pupils in grammars is at its highest level since 1978 - and almost double the historic low of 1986. Over the past 25 years, their pupil numbers have soared by tens of thousands. There are now more than 161,000 pupils in state-funded selective schools. The next Tory signal on selective education will come when Education Secretary Michael Gove rules this autumn on whether to allow one of two grammar schools in Kent to build a new ‘annexe’ in the Kent town of Sevenoaks, miles from the original schools. A Department for Education spokesman: ‘We have changed the rules so that popular schools, including grammars, can expand in response to parental demand. 'We have received two formal applications from grammar schools in Kent to expand onto the Sevenoaks site. We are currently assessing these applications.’ Under devolution, the Welsh Tories are free to set their own policy independent of Mr Cameron’s party in London. A Conservative Central Office spokesman said: ‘We don’t have an opinion on Welsh education policy because it is a devolved matter.’","Graham Brady, chairman of the 1992 Committee, called for PM to support selective education at 14 .

When eccentric aristocrat Sir Benjamin Slade picked up one of his many guns last month and strode out onto his estate, he claimed he was trying to protect the public from a mysterious big cat stalking his lands. But it seems not everyone wanted his protection. A member of the public complained to the police that they felt threatened after pictures of gun-toting Sir Benjamin, 67, were published in the Daily Mail and other newspapers. The call resulted in a visit from armed police demanding to inspect his collection of 150 ﬁrearms. The baronet had to intercept the ofﬁcers at the gates of Maunsel House, near Bridgwater, Somerset, as he had hired the venue out for a wedding and feared the guests would be upset. Sir Benjamin, who made his fortune as a shipping magnate, said that it was the fourth time his guns had been investigated and that he had contacted his MP to complain about the police response. He previously made headlines last year when police staged a dramatic raid on his home, which saw him charged with possessing a firearm without a certificate and breaching a shotgun certificate by leaving a weapon unsecured. On that occasion he said he had used the shotgun to shoot at foxes from his bedroom window. Sir Benjamin posed for the latest pictures after numerous sightings of what he claimed was a large puma stalking his grounds. A staff member even managed to take a photo of the mysterious black animal on his mobile phone. Sir Benjamin, who named the cat the Beast of North Newton after the village nearest his estate, told the Mail last month: ‘I think it is bigger than most cats, probably bigger than a puma. ‘When I saw the photo, it was visibly huge. The grass in the  picture is two-and-a-half foot high. ‘We need to get this thing shot because it may kill a young child or dog. A member of the public complained to the police that they felt threatened after pictures of gun-toting Sir Benjamin were published in the Daily Mail . ‘Plus, I need the head to put in my collection.’ A few days after the story was published Avon and Somerset Police telephoned Sir Benjamin to say they had received a complaint. They arranged to inspect his weapons on Wednesday last week. Mysterious: What appears to be a big cat in a picture taken by Sir Benjamin Slade at Maunsel House, Somerset . He told them he had a wedding booked that day but they would not reschedule - and he had no choice but to warn the couple that their happy day could be interrupted by a raid. The ofﬁcers checked the gun from the photograph and were satisﬁed that it was deactivated, but Sir Benjamin had to persuade them not to do a full inspection of his 150 weapons, which include 400-year-old muskets, a tommy gun, blunderbusses, a 12-bore Churchill shotgun and an AK47 assault riﬂe. The baronet, whose family have lived in Maunsel House since 1772 and are descended from royalty, told the Daily Telegraph: ‘We tried to keep the police out the way. You’ve got to really, it makes people nervous, they might stop drinking. ‘They [the police] wanted to check every gun in the bar and the house … there are guns on the wall everywhere. 'They would have been all crawling around the bar and the house, pulling things off the wall, which is not very helpful.’ Sir Benjamin said his weapons were all deactivated and had been inspected by police two years ago. The previous raid, last May, saw 18 armed ofﬁcers swarm the property in a raid that included roadblocks and a surveillance helicopter. All his licensed guns were conﬁscated and so what remains of his collection is deactivated. Deactivated weapons do not require a licence and are not covered by any legislation.

Sir Benjamin added: ‘We have Uzi machine guns, we have tommy guns, we have East German copies, we have American things, it helps get the sales up in the bar. They’re all deactivated, they do not work.’ Avon and Somerset police last night confirmed that they had visited Maunsel House. Supt Ian Wylie said: ‘We received a call from a member of the public who was concerned about a ﬁrearm. We attended a property to carry out a check but are satisﬁed that the weapon is decommissioned. 'We take all calls about ﬁrearms very seriously and need to make sure that ﬁrearms holders have the appropriate licences.’","Sir Benjamin Slade says the 'Beast of North Norton' has been on his land .

A fancy dress float featuring a man dressed as serial sex predator Jimmy Savile has sparked outrage in a small Scottish Borders town. Thousands of families and visitors turned out to watch the parade through Lauder in Berwickshire – one of the highlights of its annual Common Riding festivities. But bystanders’ cheers turned to gasps of horror when they saw the man’s costume theme was based on the disgraced BBC television presenter. Other men on the float were dressed as schoolgirls. Outrage: The Twenty 10 Club float which paraded through Lauder in Berwickshire . Many of the shocked spectators vowed not to attend future events staged as part of the week-long Common Riding programme, which is held to celebrate the Royal Burgh’s history. They insist the actions of the local group – calling themselves the Twenty 10 Club – went beyond what was acceptable. Some of those who were offended by the float have vented their anger on Lauder Common Riding’s Facebook page. One spectator, George Kynoch, said: ‘I feel that was a step way over the line. What I had hoped would be a pleasant night and a good memory has now been tainted.’ The fancy dress parade is part of Lauder's annual Common Riding (pictured) Another resident, Margaret Ryles, said: ‘I feel there was no respect for those who were abused by this very sick, sick man. ‘This float should never have been allowed to have been entered, regardless of freedom of speech and expression.’ Jimmy Savile is suspected of abusing more than 200 people before his death in 2011 . Christine Grahame, the Nationalist MSP for Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale, said: ‘Floats are supposed to be for fun and families. I have to say that I think this was really pretty bad taste. ‘You can have humour in some circumstances but given what we know about him now and what perhaps we have yet to find out, in these circumstances I don’t think it was appropriate.’ However the controversial entry – which was awarded third place by judges at the weekend – has also been fiercely defended on the same social networking page. And organisers of the showpiece event insist there are no plans to vet future floats. Elaine Brotherstone, secretary of Lauder Common Riding, said it would remain up to fancy dress competitors what outfits they elected  to wear. She said: ’We have never censored anyone at the fancy dress and do not intend to. There was no offence intended and they were not trivialising what happened. ‘It is about freedom of speech.  People have the right to complain but don’t have the right to tell us what to do.’ A Metropolitan Police report into allegations of sexual assault by Savile described him as a ‘prolific, predatory sex offender’ who is suspected of abusing more than 200 people before his death in 2011.","Thousands of families watched the parade through Lauder in Berwickshire .

One of a kind: Wild Bill Hickok's Smith & Wesson revolver has added value because he was wearing it when he was shot dead . The revolver worn by infamous gunslinger 'Wild' Bill Hickok when he was shot dead 150 years ago is expected to sell for $500,000 at auction. The legendary Smith and Wesson pistol was worn by the lawman in 1876 when he was shot in the back of the head while playing poker in South Dakota. It will be sold at Bonhams auction house in San Francisco in November. The antique piece boasts a .32 rimfire, a six-inch barrel and varnished rosewood grips. The gun comes with documents proving its origins and details of how it passed through generations of the Willoth family in Deadwood. Paul Carella, Bonhams' arms and armour expert, said: 'Wild Bill Hickok was one of the most iconic figures of the Wild West. 'He was friends with Buffalo Bill and Calamity Jane and was noted as the best quick-draw shooter of his time. 'He was a stagecoach driver, a lawman, a scout - he was everything that epitomised the Wild West. 'He had moved to Deathwood to find his fortune in the gold rush and also to make some money from gambling. Ironically he died at the poker table.' Hickock had a habit of sitting with his back to a wall when playing poker, but on the day of his death, the only spare chair had its back to the door . Mr Carella said: 'Following his death his effects were . given to the new sheriff who then gave the gun to a family who ran a . bazaar yo pay off debts Wild Bill had with them.

A raging wildfire in California and torrential stormy downpours in Missouri have forced hundreds to be evacuated, wrecking homes and taking lives across the U.S. An aggressive wildfire that broke out yesterday in the arid San Jacinto Mountains near Banning, east of Los Angeles, has injured three people as 1,500 residents fled their homes. Meanwhile, a child has died and a woman believed to be the mother is missing after heavy thunderstorms hit already saturated areas of south-central Missouri yesterday, forcing major interstate roads to be closed and several hundred homes to be abandoned. Scroll down for video . Battle: Two firefighters (not pictured) were injured in the battle to bring the raging wildfire in southern California, near Banning, under control. The rage engulfed homes in the Twin Pines Road area, California, pictured, yesterday . Blocked: Meanwhile, in mid-Missouri, the Interstate 44 near Jerome, pictured, was closed after torrential stormy downpours fell on already saturated land . The fire near Banning, which has devoured nine square miles, injured two firefighters yesterday who both needed hospital treatment. One civilian was airlifted to hospital with burns. Lucas Spelman, spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said about a dozen buildings were damaged or destroyed, but could not say how many were homes. Footage from TV news helicopters and photos from the scene showed several houses in flames. They include the Twin Pines home of Dave Clark, who was pictured talking on his cellphone with the home fully engulfed in flames behind him. Devastation: Many buildings in the Poppet Flats area, pictured, were destroyed yesterday by the ravaging wildfire, about 90 miles east of Los Angeles. The blaze, known as Silver Fire, roared through the area along Highway 243 between Banning and Idyllwild, California . The fire broke out shortly after 2pm near a back-country road south of Banning, about 90miles (145km) outside Los Angeles in Riverside County, and within hours had blackened more than 5,000 acres, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Daniel Berlandt said . A number of homes in the Twin Pines Road area, pictured, were completely destroyed by the out-of-control blaze. Around 1,500 residents were evacuated yesterday as the wildfire raged across the land . 'He said he lost everything, he couldn't talk,' brother Jeff Clark told the the Riverside Press-Enterprise. Mr Clark's parents were killed in a house fire, in Riverside, in April 2012, the Press-Enterprise reported. About 800 people evacuated the Silent Valley Club, a private RV resort, state fire spokesman Mr Spelman said. About 700 more were under evacuation order in the rural communities of Poppet Flats, Twin Pines, Edna Valley and Vista Grande, and evacuation centers were set up at high schools in Hemet and Banning. Smouldering: Last night, the extent of the devastation left behind in the wildfire's wake could be seen smouldering, vast swathes of the mountainside lit up by the still-burning embers . Imminent threat: Firefighters battled throughout the night to try to protect more homes from the raging flames that spread across the mountains - pictured, a house in the Twin Pines Road area .

Margaret Runnels of Poppet Flats was at work when her house came under an evacuation order. She was in Banning waiting for her husband to collect pets and valuables from their house. 'I was hoping they would let me back up to get some personal items I knew my husband would forget like a jewelry box and stuff that means stuff,' a crying Runnels told the Desert Sun. 'You always tell yourself to prepare everything but you never take the stupid time to do it.' More than 500 firefighters, helped by five helicopters and five air tankers, were working to protect homes and get ahead of the flames. People were evacuated from three communities in the arid San Jacinto Mountains - a total of 1,500 residents fled their homes .

Inescapable: Smoke from the fire blanketed downtown Palm Springs, California yesterday, making driving conditions difficult . All but three helicopters were grounded after night fall but were set to return to the air this morning. Across the country in mid Missouri, another natural disaster has wreaked havoc for many families. The region has already seen rainfall saturate the land, so when heavy thunderstorms hit early yesterday, the already saturated areas flooded. The Missouri Department of Transportation closed Interstate 44 south of Rolla along the Gasconade River, and U.S. 63 in Maries County after about six inches of rain fell in the area. Traffic was being rerouted several miles around the flooded sections of the highways, said Sgt. Dan Crain, spokesman for the Missouri State Highway Patrol in Rolla. The National Weather Service said the Gasconade River at Rich Fountain was about four feet below flood stage, the point at which water is high enough to cause flooding, early yesterday. Across the country: In Newburg, Missouri, residents faced a different natural disaster - flood water from Little Piney Creek, which burst its banks after torrential stormy weather yesterday . Interstate 44 near Jerome, Missouri, was closed by the rising waters, where the confluence of the Gasconade River and Little Piney Creek met. Gov. Jay Nixon has ordered the Missouri National Guard to help with flooding in south-central Missouri . No go: Missouri Department of Transport and State trooper workers guarded and assessed the flooded main road, and advised all drivers not to attempt to cross flooded roads . It was expected to reach its 20-foot flood stage later in the day and rise to near 32 feet early this morning, depending on how much more rain hits the area. 'It's a real mess,' Crain said. 'We're encouraging folks to be really careful. When there's water over the roads, don't take the chance. Don't take the risk. Please turn around.' Hurricane Henriette is expected to weaken as it moves across the Pacific, far from land. The hurricane's maximum sustained winds late Wednesday remained near 85mph (140 kph). The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami says additional weakening is forecast by Thursday as Henriette moves over cooler waters. Henriette is centered about 1,235 miles (1987 kilometers) east of Hilo, Hawaii, and is moving west-northwest near 10 mph (17 kph). Governor Jay Nixon also ordered the deployment of 50 military policemen of the Missouri National Guard to help local authorities dealing with flooding. Nixon declared a state of emergency Tuesday after heavy rains caused flash flooding and at least one confirmed death in the Waynesville area. A four-year-old boy was killed and several homes and businesses damaged after heavy rain drenched the south-central town of Waynesville on Monday night and Tuesday morning. The search for a missing woman who is believed to be the child's mother also resumed yesterday. About a dozen homes were evacuated early Wednesday in Newburg, a Phelps County town of about 450 residents near the Little Piney River. Laura Johnson, supervisor with the Phelps County Sheriff's Department, said a 12-foot section of a county road washed away Wednesday morning. No injuries were reported. 'We have a lot of roads shut down now,' Johnson said. The rain had stopped yesterday morning in several areas, including Newburg, and water had begun receding in some flooded sections, she said. The weather service also issued flood warnings yesterday for several southwestern Missouri counties, including Laclede and Wright counties, where several low-water crossings were also flooding after about two inches of rain fell in that region by early morning yesterday.","Raging wildfire in San Jacinto Mountains near Banning, California, has evacuated 1,500 residents, destroyed homes .

Jason Smith unwittingly mixed descaler and bleach at the Leg of Mutton and Cauliflower in Ashtead, near Epsom, Surrey, to produce chlorine - used in chemical warfare during the First World War. Fire crews who were called said he was lucky not to have lost consciousness. But Mr Smith admitted he had no idea pouring descaler then bleach down the urinal would create a poisonous chlorine gas. Toxic fumes: Jason Smith unwittingly mixed descaler and bleach at the Leg of Mutton and Cauliflower (pictured) in Ashtead, Surrey, to produce chlorine - used in chemical warfare during the First World War . Mr Smith, assistant manager at the pub, said: ‘The chemicals combined and started pumping out toxic vapour. When I saw vapour coming out I left, because I knew it was not very good.’ But he said he then decided to go back inside the pub toilet in order to wedge open the door and let fresh air inside. Fortunate: Fire crews called to the pub said Mr Smith was lucky not to have lost consciousness . Mr Smith added: ‘When I bent down close to the ground, my eyes were stinging, my lungs were burning and I nearly passed out.’ Fighting back the fumes he swiftly evacuated the pub and rang 101 to get advice. He said: ‘I realised what was happening very quickly and sealed off the section. I was about to go in there with a bucket of water when the fire brigade turned up. They took in a giant fan to blow the vapours away.’ Epsom firefighters who attended the incident at 3.30pm last Saturday said Mr Smith was lucky to escape the toilet still conscious. Crew manager Jon Bennett said: ‘He thought he was doing the right thing pouring the bleach and descaler in the toilet. If he had stayed in there we would have been carrying him out rather than him stumbling out.’ Descaling agents can sometimes include hydrochloric acid, which, if mixed with bleach can create chlorine gas - a toxic substance used to kill during the First World War. Mr Smith, who still had chest pains three days later, said he was left feeling ‘pretty stupid’ for only leaving about five minutes between pouring in the descaler then the bleach. He said: ‘I knew from household chemicals you could create mustard gas, but I didn’t realise it was the combination I had in my hands at the time.’ The result: Descaling agents can sometimes include hydrochloric acid, which, if mixed with bleach can create chlorine gas (pictured) In battle: Chlorine gas was a toxic substance used to kill during the First World War. A British Vickers machine gun crew wearing PH-type anti-gas helmets are pictured near Ovillers during the Battle of the Somme in 1916 . Roger Bibbings, occupational safety adviser at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, said: ‘It is important to read materials’ hazard data sheets and the labels on the backs of cleaning products, which should detail clear instructions for safe use. ‘Many cleaning substances are hazardous and if handled incorrectly, they can cause irritation, inflammation or chemical burns. 'Mixing chemical products together is extremely dangerous and can produce toxic vapours such as chlorine.’","Incident happened at Leg of Mutton and Cauliflower in Ashtead, Surrey .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 04:35 EST, 8 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:37 EST, 8 August 2013 . New Bank of England boss Mark Carney today slammed self-obsessed bankers detached from reality have become ‘socially useless’ and must change their ways. The Canadian former investment banker demanded a change in a City culture which has become disconnected from the businesses and workers who should benefit from a properly functioning economy. And he vowed to ‘snuff out’ irresponsible behaviour, including mis-selling products to customers which they do not need just to make profit. Criticism: Bank of England governor Mark Carney said bankers who do not focus on the wider economy are 'socially useless' Mr Carney took charge as the first foreign governor  in Threadneedle Street last month, replacing Sir Mervyn King. In his first major intervention yesterday, he announced interest rates were likely to remain at record lows for another three years. In a major boost for mortgage bill payers, he vowed to keep rates low until unemployment fell below 7 per cent, which is not expected to happen until late 2016. Today he turned his fire on bankers, demanding a ‘change in the culture’ in reckless institutions which have been blamed for the financial crash. ‘The cultural issue is fundamentally important,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. ‘There has to be a change in the culture of these institutions. It’s something I’ve spoken about in the past when I was in Canada, and it applies absolutely here as well.’ He said finance can ‘absolutely play a socially useful and an economically useful function’. But bankers and financiers had to focus on ‘the real economy, what it does for businesses making investment, what ultimately it means for jobs in the economy’. He went on: ‘It’s the loss of that focus, it’s finance that becomes disconnected from the economy, from society, finance that only talks to itself and deals with each other, that becomes socially useless. ‘One of my other responsibilities is chairing the Financial Stability Board and a lot of what we’re doing there internationally is to strip out that type of behaviour.’ Disconnected: A banking sector which 'only talks to itself and deals with each other' is bad for the whole of society, Mr Carney warned . In particular he singled out banks who put profit before customers by selling products which they did not need. Asked whether people working for banks should sell a product to a customer to make a profit, even if they know the product was bad for the customer, Mr Carney said: ‘Absolutely you shouldn’t sell it.’ He stressed that conduct in the City was the responsibility of the new Financial Conduct Authority. Britain's interest rates are likely to remain at a record low for at least three more years, the new Governor of the Bank of England said yesterday. The forecast was welcomed by business leaders, but will be a blow to millions of savers and pensioners. Speaking at the Bank’s quarterly inflation report yesterday, Mark Carney made history by formally linking the base rate to unemployment – meaning rates will not rise from their current record low of 0.5 per cent until the jobless total falls to 7 per cent or lower. The Bank suggests this will not happen until late 2016 – another three years or more. Unemployment stands at 7.8 per cent, having peaked at over 8 per cent in the wake of the financial crisis, and Mr Carney said more than 750,000 jobs will need to be created to get it down to the threshold. But he pointed out that rates would not automatically rise when unemployment hits 7 per cent. He added: ‘Nor is 7 per cent a target. 7 per cent is merely a “way station” at which the [Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates] will reassess the state of the economy.’ Mr Carney said he has ‘tremendous sympathy’ for savers, who have lost out since the Bank slashed rates to 0.5 per cent in 2009, but  launched the aggressive tactics to ‘secure the recovery’. By the end of 2016, rates will have been at the record low for nearly eight years – the longest period they have been on hold since the aftermath of the Great Depression. Figures published yesterday suggested savers will have been deprived of nearly £500billion in lost interest payments over those eight years. But he added: ‘Even if we’re not directly responsible for that behaviour, it’s that attitude in institutions that undercuts their effectiveness, is bad for the system, and to the extent that with our powers we can use them, we work to snuff them out. Mr Carney was hand-picked for the job of governor by George Osborne. He sought to reassure the public that interest rates will not rise anytime soon and hopes the use of so-called ‘forward guidance’ will boost confidence among households and businesses and help drive the economic recovery. But he said he had ‘tremendous sympathy’ for savers hit by the Bank’s announcement that interest rates will not rise from their record low until more than 750,000 new jobs have been created. He said policymakers should not pull back from stimulating the economy too early or they will risk choking off the economic recovery and ending up with a similar situation to Japan, where interest rates have remained at rock-bottom levels for years. Mr Carney said the best way to get back to normal interest rates is to have a strong economy. He told the programme: ‘We have tremendous sympathy for savers. They have done the right thing, they have set aside some money, they are earning a lower return than they would have expected when they put money aside but the best way to get interest rates back to a normal level is to have a strong economy. ‘Let me tell you, I first lived in this country in the 1980s. After that I lived in Japan and it was the start of life after the financial crisis and in Japan they made two mistakes. ‘The first was they didn’t fix the banks quickly enough - in the UK we are fixing the banks. Secondly, as their recoveries began, they pulled back on stimulus too early and those recoveries didn’t gather life and as a consequence, almost a quarter-century later, interest rates are still at rock-bottom levels in Japan. ‘We don’t want to make those mistakes here in the UK. This is about ensuring that in the reasonable future, and I recognise that it’s difficult for savers, but in the reasonable future we’re delivering that strong economy that will deliver higher interest rates and jobs.’","Canadian demands culture change in the City to focus on real economy .

A dog owner whose bull mastiff was one of five dogs to maul his former mother-in-law to death has launched a bid to save his pet from being destroyed. Dylan Mason, 44, is going to court to try to save his dog Ranger from the lethal injection - one of a group which savaged Gloria Knowles, 71, in October. The five animals pounced on the grandmother after she went into the garden to take down washing for her daughter, Beverley Mason. Five animals pounced on Gloria Knowles, 71, (left)  after she went into the garden to take down washing for her daughter, Beverley Mason (right) The widow was badly injured when the dogs – two 'giant' Bordeaux French mastiffs, two American bulldogs and a small mongrel – suddenly turned on her. She was found dead at the scene in Morden, South London, and is believed to have bled to death as a result of her injuries. Three of the animals - belonging to Mrs Knowles's daughter Beverley - have been since been put to sleep. A French mastiff called Yogi and bulldogs Missy and Lemmie were humanely destroyed by lethal injections. Now she insists her ex-husband and a third dog owner, who officers have identified only as Ms Azzoni, should follow suit and destroy their dogs. She told the Mirror that she loved her dogs, but nothing was worth more than her mother's life. She said: 'I can’t believe he is arguing that the dog should be kept alive when it killed my mum. It’s just evil.' She added that now they had tasted her mother's blood and now must be put down. Mother-of-four Mrs Mason, 43, who has a son Kurtis, 12, with her former partner, told the paper: 'The court case is just dragging everything out when it is clear the dogs all touched my mum, there is evidence of that. The widow was badly injured when the dogs ¿ two 'giant' Bordeaux French mastiffs, two American bulldogs and a small mongrel ¿ seemed to suddenly turn on her . She was found dead at the scene in Morden, South London, and is believed to have bled to death as a result of her injuries . 'My mum was everything. She was my rock. Losing her has been devastating for us all.' The Met has said that the remaining two dogs are dangerous and must be killed. A spokesman said: 'The hearing for the destruction of two dogs will be held at Wimbledon magistrates between 9 and 11 October. 'There is court hearing upcoming in October, and that is when the Met will give its evidence.' At the trial Mr Mason and the owner of the other dog will argue that they dispute the evidence that their animals were involved in the attack. Mrs Knowles lived next door to her daughter, with her granddaughter, who has a baby of her own. The family has run Harrington's pie and mash shop in nearby Tooting, for several generations. Mrs Mason said she has owned dogs her entire life and had no idea why her dogs - which she insists were normally well behaved - would have turned on her mother. She said the family had had them since they were puppies and they were well trained. She said they would often sit with them on the sofa. She said she has decided to keep her mother's dogs, Bo, Amber and Tia, for her, but that she finds it difficult to trust them . An inquest is expected to take place on September 25 in Westminster, Central London. The dogs have been reportedly homes in Met-approved kennels since the incident - which has a cost £15 per dog per day.

Driving off a crowded Cornish beach after teaching disabled children to surf, Mark Hill found his path blocked by hundreds of holidaymakers – and with the tide rushing in. He activated his lights, sounded sirens and used his vehicle’s PA system to urge people to move. But the more noise he made, the more people swarmed around the Land Rover and trailer to see what was going on. Scroll down for video . Holding on tight: Mark Hill can be seen clinging to his trailer by Towan Beach in Newquay after it got caught up in the incoming tide . Some belligerent tourists even clambered on to the vehicle and stared at him, refusing to budge. Realising he was trapped Mr Hill freed . the trailer, which went floating out to sea within minutes. But he was . unable to drive the Land Rover away and it was engulfed on the beach by . the tide. Mr Hill, 38, swam out to the trailer – . packed with vital equipment for his not-for-profit surf school – and . climbed on top of it until it was towed back to shore by a fishing . vessel. But that was only the beginning of  his tale of woe, which unfolded at  Towan Beach in Newquay on Wednesday afternoon. An RNLI lifeboat and other vessels surround the stranded trailer by Towan Beach in Newquay yesterday . Sticky situation: Mr Hill claims tourists on the beach prevented him from moving his trailer in time to avoid the incoming tide - leaving him with no choice but to detach it from his truck and let it drift out to sea . Ransacked: Mr Hill's submerged Land Rover which couldn't be recovered until the low tide came in this morning when it had already been looted by snorkelers overnight . Good timing: A passing fishing trawler spots Mr Hill on his trailer as it drifts further and further out to sea . Determined: The fishing vessel and another boat come to Mr Hill's aid as he refuses to let his trailer disappear into the ocean . He had been unable to save the Land . Rover because although he had sand mats and a winch system that might . have allowed him to drive it off the beach, he decided not to use the . equipment because of the risk of injuring onlookers. The inshore lifeboat’s attempt to tow the submerged vehicle failed. Then at 10pm on Wednesday Mr Hill . received a phone call to tell him that snorkellers were looting the Land . Rover. ‘It was tourists, or should I say opportunists,’ he said . yesterday. Rescue: The fishing vessel towed Mr Hill and his trailer in to the harbour in Newquay . Coming ashore: Mr Hill and his trailer pictured being towed towards the shore. Unfortunately the RNLI couldn't move his Land Rover which was also submerged until the tide went out this morning . ‘We all know each other around here and it’s a very small community, so it wasn’t local residents.’ Around £2,000 worth of wetsuits, . tools, surfboards and equipment were stolen from the Land Rover which is . a write-off. The looters vanished before police arrived. ‘They weren’t stealing from me, they . were stealing from people less fortunate than themselves, from disabled . children and adults,’ said Mr Hill, who is the director of Freedom Surf . and has been teaching disadvantaged and disabled youngsters to surf for . seven years. However, his plight has brought a . generous response from strangers and Mail Online readers, who have . offered equipment and cash, including one offer of £500. ‘The response . has been amazing,’ he said. ‘It has restored my faith in human nature.’ Ordeal: While Mr Hill managed to get his trailer back to shore relatively undamaged, his Land Rover was looted overnight before he had a chance to retrieve it . Help at hand: Mr Hill prepares to jump off his trailer as members of RNLI come to assist him to shore . Safe at last: The trailer was safely brought ashore in Newquay yesterday with remarkably little damage after being washed out to sea .

A carer left a disabled patient sitting in her car for two hours in freezing winter temperatures. Wilma Goodbrand, 42, repeatedly left Stephen Armstrong - who was paralysed from the neck down and required 'constant supervision' - alone in her car while she attended to another client in Lanarkshire, a court heard. Goodbrand narrowly escaped a prison sentence today following her conviction for willfully neglecting Mr Armstrong - who died in April this year - during the bitterly cold winter of 2011. Cruel: Carer Wilma Goodbrand (left) left Stephen Armstrong (right) - who had learning difficulties and was paralysed from the neck down - sitting in her car for two hours in bitterly cold temperatures . Mr Armstrong, who had learning difficulties, was left paralysed after falling down a flight of stairs while under sedation in 2008. Goodbrand, a carer with Church of Scotland group Threshold West of Scotland, cruelly left him alone in her car on numerous occasions during November and December 2011 as she visited another client in East Kilbride. Threshold had been sub-contracted by South Lanarkshire Council to provide care for Mr Armstrong, but sacked Goodbrand when her actions emerged. Goodbrand, of Wishaw, was found guilty of willfully neglecting Stephen between November and December 2011 at Hamilton Sheriff court last month. 'Extraordinary': A judge ordered Goodbrand to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work at Hamilton Sheriff Court today, after she was convicted last month of willfully neglecting Mr Armstrong . Today Sheriff Douglas Brown, who described Goodbrand's actions as 'an extraordinary way to treat someone', sentenced her to a maximum community payback order sentence of 300 hours unpaid work. Mr Armstrong's sister, Katherine Alexander, told how she had trusted her brother's carer 'implicitly'. The mother-of-one, 52, from Argyll, said: 'The important thing for me is that Wilma Goodbrand will never work in care again. Stephen Armstrong's sister, Katherine Alexander . 'I am appalled by what Wilma did and I trusted her implicitly. It was a huge shock when she was charged and an even bigger shock when she was convicted. 'Stephen has been hugely let down by the care sector. Care budgets are being squeezed and there are going to be more people in the same situation as Wilma. She knew what she was doing was wrong but care workers are being overworked. They are asked to go the extra mile and work long hours.' Ms Alexander said Goodbrand's employer should have been 'standing in the dock beside her'. 'I feel no sympathy for her but I do think employers should be held responsible too,' she said. Defence lawyer Sandy Morrison said: 'The severity of the offence is not lost on her. 'She has a previous good character and hasn’t had any sort of blemishes or issues with her employers.  She is clearly fit to carry out unpaid work as an alternative to custody.' Sentencing Goodbrand, Sheriff Douglas Brown said: 'It would have been an ordeal for anyone to be left in a vehicle. 'It was potentially dangerous as he required constant supervision and it was never explained why you did it. This seems an extraordinary way to treat someone but in your favour you have no previous convictions and this seems to be entirely out of character. 'I also accept that you have had significant punishment in that you have lost your job. 'I’ll make a community payback order with the maximum sentence of 300 hours unpaid work to be completed in six months as a direct alternative to custody,' he added. A spokesman for CrossReach, the Social Care Council of the Church of Scotland, said: 'CrossReach sincerely regrets what occurred in the late winter of 2011 which resulted in a member of staff being dismissed as a result of failing to meet the standards expected our staff. 'Following the incident a Critical Incident Review, informed by a review of our safeguarding procedure, examined the event and an action plan, detailing actions to seek to prevent a re-occurrence, was implemented.  This is a high priority for CrossReach and will be kept under review.'","Wilma Goodbrand, 43, convicted of willful neglect of 50-year-old .

A Virginia man has snagged a world record by catching a monster 'frankenfish' that clocked in at just under 17 and a half pounds. Nicknamed frankenfish for its terrifying appearance and adaptability, the northern snakehead was caught back in June but Caleb Newton of Spotsylvania County has only now been confirmed the record holder. The fiercely invasive Asian species has taken over waterways up and down the East Coast and is known to survive outside water for several days, but Newton, 27, said it only took him about a minute to reel the beast in. Champion: Caleb Newton (pictured) caught this 17 pound, 6 ounce frankenfish in a Virginia tournament in June and the fish has now been deemed a world record . Beastly: The invasive species has been spotted from California to Massachusetts but most sightings of the fish that can live outside water for days occur near the Chesapeake Bay . Though getting it home was another matter. Newton told the Fredericksburg Free Lance-Star that the three foot, 17- pound 6-ounce fish barely fit inside his cooler. The International Game Fish Association confirmed Monday that Newton, a plumber by trade, had beaten the previous record from 2004 in Miki Kagawa, Japan by two ounces. ‘How long it will hold up, I have no idea,’ Newton said. Newton caught the champion fish in Aquia Creek, a tributary of the Potomac River, on June 1 in a tournament that had 15 other boats. Growing threat: A map indicates where sightings have occurred. Experts believe the relentless species was introduced from its native Yangtze River through the Mid-Atlantic region. The first sighting occurred in Maryland . Adaptable: Even densely urban New York City has been affected. Signs near Central Park waterways warn anglers 'If you catch this fish, do not release' Native to China, Russia, and Korea, the northern snakehead has been spotted from California to Massachusetts, with the densest populations found near the Chesapeake Bay, which is where the Newton’s whopper of a fish was caught. Even New York City’s Central Park waterways are beginning to sag under the weight of the relentless species. Signs have been erected along the park’s waterways by the Department of Environmental Conservation warning anglers who snag one of the unappealing fish not to throw it back but to hand it over. 'Secure the fish' and 'keep it in a secure container until it is picked up by officials,' the sign instructs. Hungry: Experts fear the northern snakehead will out compete and decimate native fish as it eats everything in its path . A similar warning is posted on Maryland's Department of Natural Resources website. Maryland manages the snakehead differently than Virginia, which prohibits commercial sales to avoid creating a market for the fish. Maryland encourages sales, maintaining that eating snakehead gives other fish a chance. Wildlife specialists fear the invasive fish will out compete native species and wipe out other creatures as it eats everything in its path. The gruesome-looking creature, which has snakelike head, is so disruptive that the state of New York prohibits possession, sale, and transport of the live fish and its eggs. Gamey: Newton, 27, caught his fish during a tournament against 15 other boats in Aquia Creek, a tributary of the Potomac River . Plenty of other non-native fish have thrived in the United States, but few rival the northern snakehead: as long as three feet or more, the fish has a large, toothy mouth and can survive for days out of water, squirming and secreting a full-body slime. It is a delicacy in Asia and is gaining a following among chefs in the United States. But for his part as a conqueror of the dreaded fish, Newton seemed unimpressed by his record catch. ‘I caught one 13 pounds on Saturday,’ he said. ‘And that one fought harder.’","Caleb Newton caught the monster during a tournament in Spotsylvania County .

Ringleader: Fred Thompson, pictured arriving at Hull Crown Court, is facing jail for his role in the counterfeit porn DVD factory . Four men who ran a huge counterfeit porn DVD factory face jail after customers complained to Trading Standards that the films were too short. Clients of Fantasy Dome, based in Hull, East Yorkshire, also wrote letters bemoaning that fact that the illicit sex videos were of poor quality, a court heard. Former sex shop owner Fred Thompson, 69, was the ringleader of the operation, which saw the gang copying and distributing tens of thousands of illegal sex DVDs across the world. The scam was run by Thompson, of west Hull, in partnership with Shaun Langley. Nigel Maw, 52, of Newport, and his son David Maw, 31, of west Hull, had entered into an agreement to buy the mail order business from Thompson and were working there. All of them had a financial interest in the business at the time. Hull Crown Court heard the defendants copied fake DVDs at a factory in St Georges Road, west Hull, and had industrial machines to print fake packaging for the copies. They then sold illicit and unauthorised copies by mail order and over the internet. Trading Standards officers raided the factory and found all four defendants working there. They were trading under the names of Fantasy Dome and Fantasy Dome Online. Officers found two large blue storage containers full of illegal DVDs. Prosecutor Charlene Sumnall said: 'This is not a case about the morality of porn or adult entertainment. Whether you like it or not, there is a market for legitimate porn and thousands of customers use it everyday. 'Those customers, like any others, deserve protection from being defrauded. Just like any other release, it has to go before the film board to see if it is lawful and OK to be sold. 'All four defendants played individual and key roles in this agreement to produce, distribute, defraud and encourage the sale of adult content material. 'All the material found, save for a few original discs, have been found to be illicit. 'A large DVD rewriter was able to produce four copies of a DVD at the same time. 'Unsuspecting members of the public were in no position to complain to Trading Standards that they were getting shoddy discs because of the nature of the product.' Officers found letters from customers complaining the films were not as long as they were supposed to be and were of poor quality. Criminal offence: Hull Crown Court heard the defendants copied fake DVDs at a factory in St Georges Road, west Hull, and had industrial machines to print fake packaging for them . A jury at Hull Crown Court found all four men unanimously guilty of conspiracy to make, distribute and defraud customers by producing illegal porn DVDs following a three-week trial. Judge Mark Bury told them: 'You have all been convicted and I will adjourn sentence. You can all have bail in the meantime. 'These are serious offences for which a sentence of imprisonment may well be passed and this sentence will be immediate.' In the same raid, officers also uncovered the city’s first counterfeiting currency scam, which saw more than £22,000 of fake notes produced. The former Adultnation sex shop, in Hull’s Beverley Road, had been transformed into a counterfeiting den producing £10, £20 and 50 euro notes. Officers discovered notes in various stages of production and found a large stash of sheets of newly printed notes hidden under a carpet. Thompson was previously found guilty of possessing £2,380 in counterfeit notes with intent to spend them and was given a six-month prison sentence. Langley, of north Hull, pleaded guilty to producing the notes at the shop, claiming he was working under orders from his boss and was previously jailed for two years. Most of the fake money was spent in the Beverley area. The court heard Thompson said: 'I like to be Jack The Lad in Hessle Road. I am not ashamed of my offending. I have never hurt anybody.' Sentencing is due next month.","Customers complained to Trading Standards that films were 'poor quality'

'Comfortable in my skin': Janice Atkinson says being a member of UKIP allows her to speak her mind on the issues that matter to her . She is one of Britain's most senior female politicians, a working class girl who started her own business and lauds other 'strong women' . But now Janice Atkinson is standing up for the men - and the very ones who have been labelled 'sexist' by so many in recent weeks. The former Tory joined UKIP after defecting from the Labour party after the last election. And in the wake of several infamous interviews by male members of her party that many have deemed 'sexist', Mrs Atkinson - now one of UKIP's front-running candidates for next year's European elections - has said that Labour and the Tories are far more anti-women. UKIP's treasurer Stuart Wheeler recently caused a stir when he claimed women were no good at chess, bridge or poker, while Godfrey Bloom, the MEP of the infamous 'bongo bongo land' comment and who said women were better suited to 'finding mustard in the pantry' than parking cars. But in an interview published in The Times today, Mrs Atkinson said she would never have joined the party if it was full of misogynists. 'If you think about the political parties and the type of people that belong to them, I came across more sexism in the Tory party than I ever have done in UKIP,' she said. In her posts on the Daily Mail RightMinds blog, she has written in support of women such as MP Louise Mensch, who resigned her position as Conservative MP for Corby last August. Defence: Stuart Wheeler, left, and Godfrey Bloom, right, are not the ones with the 'outdated attitudes', says Janice Atkinson . Mrs Atkinson wrote of Mrs Mensch that 'Men hate her . because she was successful and made money' and 'women feminist . Guardianistas will tear her apart for letting down the sisterhood'. Now Mrs Atkinson has insisted that the . 'outdated attitudes' belong to the constitutional clubs in the Tory . shires or the working men’s clubs of Labour’s northern heartlands rather . than her own progressive party. 'They’d like to go back to a 1950s Britain. We’re not going back to a 1950s Britain, we’ve got to look forward,' she said. Who's the fruitcake? Mrs Atkinson defected from the Tory party after last election . By contrast, she described Mr Wheeler as 'a sweetie'. Mr . Bloom, she said, was not being sexist when he said small businesses . should be allowed to sack female employees who fall pregnant. 'The . point he was making is that this is all very damaging,' she said. 'If you take the . baker’s down the road, if they employ five or six women and three or . four of them go off on maternity leave, that’s a big problem.' Her . only criticism of his remark was that he gave women too much credit on . the pantry-hunting front. 'My husband’s better at it,' she laughs. 'I . stand there in my kitchen and I can’t find the mustard.' As for his reference to countries . receiving UK aid as 'bongo bongo land', Mr Bloom 'does not have a racist . bone in his body', she said. The . former Conservative candidate for Batley and Spen in West Yorkshire . where she stood as Janice Small, who was beaten to her seat by her . Labour rival, says she has no regrets about switching over to UKIP. The . party has time to hear her passionate views on Europe, she said, and she feels . freer to discuss immigration, welfare and grammar schools than she did . with the Tories. 'I feel comfortable in my skin now,' she said. 'I feel comfortable knocking on doors and talking to the issues that matter to them without being politically correct.' The daughter of a cleaner and a coal worker, who left school at 16 and started her own business, says she is also opposed to the idea of favouring women in the boardroom. She believes women have only themselves to blame when they don't make it to the top. 'There's this whole endemic sort of feminista thing and because they can't get there by their own means they want quotas and they want to impost that on the rest of us,' she said. She said she would 'love' to reach the . point where half of all companies were headed by women. But sheattacked . 'hectoring' Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman for supporting quotas to . alter the gender balance on company boards. 'I am everything . that Harriet Harman isn’t,' she said. Cut the mustard: Mrs Atkinson concedes that her husband is the one who finds the condiments in her house . She said she would 'love' to reach the point where half of all companies were headed by women, but attacked 'hectoring' Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman for supporting quotas to alter the gender balance on company boards, calling herself 'everything that Harriet Harman isn’t'. As well as her likely ascension to the European Parliament next year, Mrs Atkinson said she has plans to fight for a marginal Tory seat in Kent. She refused to say which one, but hinted that it is currently held by a 'token women'.","Janice Atkinson says in interview she would never join 'misogynist' party .

Accidental death: Adriano Bussandri was found dead in his burnt £1.8m home having taken Class-B drugs . A former oil executive found dead after a fire gutted his £1.8million home was hooked on ‘designer drugs’ bought on the internet, an inquest heard. The badly burnt and wounded body of former finance director Adriano Bussandri, 51, was discovered under debris at the top of the house, near a sharp letter opener and screwdriver. Police initially launched a murder investigation but later decided that cuts found on Mr Bussandri’s arms, sides and back were most likely self-inflicted because he had a history of self-harming. It was unclear how the blaze had started. Mr Bussandri, a British citizen of Italian origin, was a founder of London-based wholesale petrol and bio-fuel supplier Harvest Energy, which made almost £26million  last year. But he resigned from his post  as finance director after it was embroiled in a contaminated supermarket fuel scandal in 2007, which led to £8million in compensation being paid to almost 20,000 Tesco customers after their vehicles were damaged. He was not working at the time of his death and lived separately from his wife, Marisa, 50, and daughter Sabrina, 19, in an exclusive area of Putney, South-West London. Mr Bussandri’s brother Franco, who is managing director of Harvest Energy, attended yesterday’s inquest with his brother’s wife. Caught on camera: Firefighters arrive to tackle the flames on teh night Adriano Bussandri died at his Putney home in south west London . Drug: The dead high-flyer had taken a large amount of MDPV before his death - a Class B designer drug made up from compounds found in bath salts and plant food . Westminster Coroner’s Court heard how . Mr Bussandri started taking non-prescription drugs around 11 years ago . when he suffered a brain haemorrhage following a road accident. A report from Mr Bussandri’s GP stated . he had ‘a history of depression and drug dependency’ and in 2011 he was . treated at The Priory. A post-mortem examination found drugs in his system, which he is thought to have bought from Dutch and German websites. Intense blaze: The fire gutted two top-floors of the property making it hard for investigators to gather evidence . Searching for clues: Police forensic officers investigated the death of the oil executive in February . Detective Sergeant Richard Reynolds told the hearing that he  carried out a full search of Mr Bussandri’s home. He said: ‘Within the property there . were small quantities of chemical-based compounds, unlike the . traditional drugs that are more organic, like cocaine and heroin.’ He described the compounds, which are sometimes extracted from everyday household products, as designer drugs. Probe: At first police considered whether the death may have been murder, but a coroner has ruled it was accidental . The inquest heard firefighters were . called to an intense blaze at Mr Bussandri’s home in the early hours of . February 8 this year, after neighbours raised the alarm. It took around three hours for fire crews to find the body.

A terminally ill woman is fighting to end her life so that she can donate her organs so others can live. Sherri Muzher, 43, from Detroit, Michigan, was just 27 when she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in the summer after her first year at law school. The incurable condition, which causes the immune system to attack the body's central nervous system, has seen her body deteriorate drastically, leaving her unable to walk and barely talk. She she says now wants to regain control of her life - by choosing when she will die. Life after death: Sherri Muzher, who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis 16 years ago, wants to end her life so that she can donate her organs to those who need them . 'I would rather I help give life to others while my organs are still viable,' she told WDIV. 'It is my reality. I'm getting weaker. Weaker muscles on my talking, everything. This ultimately brings reality home.' Of her condition, she added: 'It is a lot of loss - loss with advanced MS. It's a grieving process, because you are losing your independence gradually.' Medical ethicists said while Muzher's case is compelling, it is troubled by the fact she lives in Michigan, which is still haunted by the case of Dr Jack Kervorkian. The doctor, who was branded 'Doctor Death', was a euthanasia activist who claimed to have assisted in as many as 130 deaths. Changed life: Muzher, left with a friend, was 27 when she was diagnosed with MS while at law school . Daily struggle: Muzher, pictured undergoing physical therapy, is unable to walk and struggles to talk .

A rioter has been evicted from his council flat exactly two years after he looted a bank during the London violence. It is believed to be the first successful eviction carried out in relation to the riots. Jonathan Mason, 37, joined a mob to burgle the HSBC branch in Lavender Hill, Battersea, south London, on August 8th, 2011. He was convicted of burglary and jailed for three years in 2012. Wandsworth Council, which owns Mason’s flat in Fontley Way, Roehampton, started proceedings to evict him following his conviction. Punishment: Jonathan Mason, 37, is the first person to be evicted as a result of his part in the London riots of 2011 . Anniversary: His eviction, thought to be the first in connection with the riots, happened two years on from the trouble itself . After a ‘lengthy legal process’ an eviction order was granted in July this year on the grounds that he had breached his tenancy agreement. He was also ordered to pay off £5,695 in rent arrears. Mason had 28 days to appeal - but that time ran out yesterday. He is believed to still be serving his sentence and the eviction took place in his absence. Wandsworth housing spokesman Councillor Paul Ellis said: 'Mr Mason’s decision to involve himself in the shocking scenes of violence, looting and disorder that struck Clapham Junction in August 2011, coupled with his wilful refusal to pay his rent, has resulted in him losing his council flat. 'As a consequence, it is extremely unlikely he will be offered taxpayer subsidised social housing by any other council or housing association. He will have to stand on his own two feet and arrange his own accommodation from now on. 'This is the price he must pay for his actions that night. Robbery: Mason joined a mob that looted a branch of HSBC in Battersea during the trouble . 'The date of today’s eviction is nothing more than pure coincidence, but it does serve as a timely reminder that here in this borough we make no apology whatsoever for taking a tough stance with those who choose to engage in serious criminality. 'We have no room on our estates for looters, rioters and those who refuse to pay their rent.' A council spokesman said: 'When a tenant is given the keys to a council property in Wandsworth they must sign a binding agreement that neither they nor any of their household members will engage in criminal or anti-social behaviour anywhere in the borough, or commit any acts that that cause fear, harassment or nuisance to other people living in the area. 'Failure to abide by this tenancy agreement renders them liable to eviction. 'In parallel, the council’s finance department was also seeking Mr Mason’s removal from the property as a result of his rent arrears, which now stand at £5,695. 'The judge ordered Mr Mason to pay these off without delay.'","Jonathan Mason was evicted from his Roehampton flat by Wandsworth Council .

Claims: Healthcare assistant Gillian Austin says she was bullied by colleagues for six months after raising concerns about nursing practices . A hospital whistleblower who claims she was bullied by colleagues after raising concerns about nursing practices was offered just 56 pence in compensation to settle her case, a court heard. Healthcare assistant Gillian Austin, 58, is attempting to sue Southend University Hospital for £185,000 in damages claiming she was subjected to six months of victimisation. She says she reported a nurse for taking just four-and-a-half hours break between shifts believing it was putting patients at risk. ‘The whistleblowing letter was written . out of concern at the fact she finished her night shift at 7.30am and . was rostered to start a bank shift at noon,' she told East London Employment Tribunal Service. ‘I felt what she was doing was irresponsible behaviour, and in the letter I described it as extremely dangerous.’ Mrs Austin told the court that as a result of the letter she was made to appear before a disciplinary panel. She said she was exonerated at her subsequent disciplinary hearing, while the allegations against the nurse were upheld. But Mrs Austin alleges senior managers instructed colleagues to alienate and bully her as a result. She resorted to secretly recording conversations with colleagues in a bid to prove she was being victimised. ‘There was alienation, bullying, harassment, and victimisation, and I did have the tapes’, she said. ‘I had them transcribed by a court . preferred company, and the keywords are all there - evil, manipulative, . bully, harassment, and liars. ‘The point I am making is under the . whistleblowing policies, I shouldn’t have been subjected to six months . of repercussions.' Mrs Austin was offered a settlement by . the hospital of just 56p, and is now putting this forward as part of . her collection of grievances. Dispute: Senior managers at Southend University Hospital instructed colleagues to alienate Mrs Austin following her whistleblowing letter, a court heard . Mrs Austin, who is now on . antidepressants, says she tried to sort her complaints through human . resources, ACAS, and with her union, before taking the hospital to . tribunal. She lodged an official grievance in . November 2009 and forced the hospital to appoint an independent assessor . to look at her claims, but said the subsequent report clearing health . bosses was ‘completely farcical’. The hospital, which is contesting the allegations, says proper . procedures were followed in dealing with Mrs Austin’s complaints. The independent inquiry found the . whistleblowing procedures had not been correctly followed, but supported . the outcomes of the disciplinary hearings. The report also noted that Mrs Austen . had not helped her feeling of becoming isolated from colleagues by . secretly taping their conversations. It also found no evidence of intimidation or bullying. Mrs Austin has ploughed ahead with the tribunal despite being warned by a judge last year that she has very little chance of winning. Judge Martin Warren, assessing the . case last year, ordered the healthcare assistant to pay a £1,000 deposit . to bring the case to tribunal because he believed she should drop her . claims. He told her: ‘I really do not think you have a good chance of succeeding, I think you have little prospect of success. ‘If you fail, the respondents will . undoubtedly make an application for costs and the tribunal, in deciding . whether to order costs will look at this judgement and the fact that you . were ordered to pay a deposit.’ He warned Mrs Austin, who earns . £26,000 a year working at the hospital, that she could face a hefty . costs bill if the tribunal rules against her.

Savvy homeowners are making more than £2,500 a year by renting out their driveways, new figures have revealed. And the average resident using their personal parking space as a money spinner is earning around £1,000 a year. In the capital the rewards are even higher with London residents earning an average of £2,040 a year and locals in the affluent borough of Kensington and Chelsea making £2,517. The second biggest earning city is Manchester, with money-minded residents bringing in £1,492 a year - ahead of Edinburgh on £1,462. Asset management: Homeowners who don't using their driveways are cashing in on their hidden potential by renting them out as parking spaces to others . Making up the top five cities are Nottingham where the average is £1,447 and Brighton just behind at £1,390. The figures released today come on the back of an announcement from communities secretary Eric Pickles, a keen supporter of similar schemes. In recent months councils have threatened residents who rent their driveways out without telling their local authorities first. But Mr Pickles says councils should also be welcoming this 'common sense' way of people making the most of what they've got instead of penalising them. The research was carried out by website YourParkingSpace.co.uk, which advertises peoples' driveways to those looking to save money on costly car park fees. Support: Community Secretary Eric Pickles has spoken out in favour of the trend and says homeowners should be allowed to use their property to make extra money if they wish . There are currently more than 20,000 parking spaces registered on the site across 10,000 individual locations in the UK, hiring out spare driveways, parking spaces and garages. Charles Cridland, founder of YourParkingSpace.co.uk, said: 'Renting a driveway, garage or secure parking space is an easy, simple and potentially lucrative way for homeowners to earn some extra income. 'If your home is near to local amenities such as a train station or sporting venue, it certainly boosts the earning potential of a parking space, but as our analysis shows, it is possible to earn a significant amount in all parts of the UK.' Although unsurprisingly the highest rents are reserved for the wealthier parts of Londond the figures show there are still 23 towns from Plymouth to Aberdeen where residents make more than £1,000 a year. In Telford, which took the final spot in the website's top 50 league table, residents earn on £612 on average by renting out a parking space. Mr Cridland added: 'A number of English councils have recently revealed the vast surpluses they are making from parking charges . 'By registering your driveway or garage on YourParkingSpace.co.uk, homeowners have the opportunity to take a slice of this money.' The research follows news that one wealthy homeowner in Hyde Park, London is selling their parking space for a staggering £300,000 - almost twice the average home price. 1. London £2,0402.

With their florid complexions, thick woollen coats and mutton chop whiskers, there's no doubting the men in these portraits come from the Victorian industrial age. But while these 19th century workers from the Welsh valleys look typical, they were in fact far from it, thanks to their unusually humane boss. Eccentric ironmaster Francis Crawshay rejected the trappings of his wealthy family to live amongst his workers, learning Welsh so he could talk to them and even having their portraits painted for posterity. Rare glimpse into the characters of Britain's industrial age: William James, left, was a roller in the works while John Davies, right, was a manager at the tin mills owned by the wealthy eccentric Francis Crawshay . Foreman carpenter Llewellyn Jenkins wore a wool suit, while cinder filler David Davies is pictured with a shovel . Crawshay's egalitarian relationship . with his staff, astounding in an age when industrialists were known for . their ruthless and often inhumane treatment of staff, is revealed in an . exhibition of the portraits at the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff. It . features the oil portraits of 16 of Crawshay's favourite employees at . his family's ironworks in Hirwaun, in the Cynon Valley, and tinplate . works at Treforest, near Pontypridd. Reluctrant industrialist Francis Crawshay shunned the trappings of his wealthy family and instead cultivated close relationships with his staff in the Welsh valleys . The . museum's Oliver Fairclough said: 'Francis Crawshay maintained unusually . close personal relationships with his employees and was an unusually . humane industrialist. 'He . commissioned 16 small portraits of his employees and no other such . images of industrial workers are known.  This seems to be a unique group . of individual workers of the period.' Crawshay . was the third generation of a family who made a fortune from the . booming iron trade in Victorian south Wales, and he grew up in great . style in Cyfarthfa Castle, Merthyr Tydfil - then the iron capital of the . world. Unlike most tycoons of the day, however, the eccentric Crawshay chose to live alongside the staff who manned the family's works. While most local ironmasters exploited their staff, who lived in squalid conditions and worked long hours for little pay, it was different for those who worked for a Crawshay mine. Son of the great ironmaster William . Crawshay, Francis was known as 'Mr Frank' to his workers and even learnt . Welsh so that he could speak to them in their own language. An art lover, he treated them as equals and became so close that he commissioned travelling portrait artist William Jones Chapman to paint them in oils between 1835-1840. While the wealthy of the ear sometimes . commissioned portraits of domestic servants and estate workers, these . are the only known paintings of industrial workers, and unlike the massaged portraits of nobility from the time, the portraits show the men in the raw. Mr Fairclough said: 'Although a number of 18th and 19th . century country servant portraits are known this seems to be a unique . group of individual images of industrial workers of the period.' The men pictured worked at either the Hirwaun ironworks, pictured, or a tinplate works at Treforest, Pontypridd .

Tin . roller William James is gripping a large clamp used to handle molten . tin, while David Davies holds a long pole used in the iron-making . process. Those pictured include a foreman, a lodge keeper, carpenter and tin roller, among many other characters who kept the Crawshay coffers bursting. Both John Richards, left, and lodge keeper Thomas Euston, who had a glint in his eye, needed a stick to walk . Favoured employees: Thomas Kirkhouse, left, was chosen to be painted as was this unnamed man, right . Now the 170-year-old pictures have been handed over to the museum in Cardiff by Crawshay's ancesters for an exhibition that runs until September 22. Crawshay, who was married with eight children, preferred not to live in the big family house and instead built himself a small cottage to live in. He became interested in druids and built his own druidic circle near the house, while he left following the closure of the Hirwaun and Treforest works in 1859 and 1867, to retire Kent where it was said he enjoyed walking around in nautical dress. Crawshay died in 1878 aged 67. Regarded as one of the cradles of the Industrial Revolution, Merthyr Tydfil was the iron capital of the world for much of the 19th century. As industry boomed in the valleys, what was a village of just 40 homes in 1760s turned into a sprawling town that was home to almost 8,000 people by 1801. But while the metal and coal mines that sparked the boom may have brought joy to the overlords who made their fortunes from them, life for those who worked in them was a very different matter. Lured from farms across Wales by the prospect of steady work, workers lived four or five to a one-room stone house, often built on top of iron slag heaps. Scenic view: Life in Merthyr Tydfil 170 years ago was a struggle - disease was rife, conditions were squalid and many ironmasters exploited their staff . Conditions in what came to be known as Little Hell were just that: with no toilets, the streets were open sewers and diseases such as cholera and typhoid were rife. Lice were common amongst the workers who worked and slept side by side in cramped conditions. Ironmasters provided housing for their employees, but they were squalid slums, and life expectancy was low with a high rate of infant mortality. The factory and mine managers were often cruel towards their staff - rights were unheard of and hours were long. Many paid their staff with company tokens that could only be spent in their own, company-controlled shops called 'truck shops', where prices were inflated by as much as 10 per cent. In the midst of all this, Francis Crawshay and his philanthropy stood out like a beacon, and he refused to exploit his staff as so many of contemporaries were.","Ironworks boss Francis Crawshay learnt Welsh so he could talk to workers .

Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy today stepped up the war of words with Britain, vowing to do everything to 'defend' his country's interests. In a fresh escalation of the diplomatic tensions between Britain and Spain over Gibraltar, Mr Rajoy promised to take 'all necessary legal steps' in the stand-off after holding a meeting with King Juan Carlos. It comes as British warships are being sent to Gibraltar by Defence Secretary Philip Hammond to demonstrate the Royal Navy’s ‘formidable strength. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy promised to take 'all necessary legal steps' to protect his country's interests . Stand-off: The Spanish PM spoke out after holding talks with Spain's King Juan Carlos (right) at the Marivent Palace in Palma de Mallorca . Three ships including the frigate HMS . Westminster depart for Gibraltar on Monday even as the diplomatic row . with Madrid escalates over plans for draconian border controls. Mr Rajoy said he hoped to hold talks with Britain to end the dispute over shipping and increased border checks. But until then he would step up unilateral action to protect Spain from outside threats. He said: 'I . hope that this doesn't go any further, but it's clear that Spain has to . defend its national interest and that's what we're going to do.' Setting sail: HMS Westminster will leave Britain on Monday and is expected in Gibraltar from August 19 . Ship shape: A sailor polishes HMS Westminster's ship's bell ahead of her deployment on Cougar 13 . Supplies: Food and drink is prepared to keeping troops fighting fit while taking part in the exercise . Downing Street said it was aware of the remarks, which come just two days after David Cameron warned Mr Rajoy that increased checks and plans to charge £43 to enter and leave the Rock were ‘totally disproportionate and unacceptable’. It was seen as coded warning that . Britain is prepared to take Spain to court if it goes ahead with . measures which are seen to be in breach of European law. With diplomatic relations between . Britain and Spain over Gibraltar already in the deep freeze, the . Ministry of Defence announced details of the naval deployment to the region, called Cougar ’13. Mr . Hammond said the planned deployment of a total of 10 vessels to the . region as part of a rapid reaction force will underline the Navy’s . 'global reach'. The move comes just days after Gibraltar’s chief minister called for the British military to send forces into the area. Ten vessels including the aircraft . carrier Illustrious, two frigates and support ships are heading to the . waters off Gibraltar as part of an annual exercise.

All aboard: A crane lifts equipment on to RFA Lyme Bay as part of the deployment to 'protect the free, safe and lawful use of the sea' News that British warships are heading to Gibraltar is likely to add to the tensions with Spain . But defence officials revealed that three of them – the frigate Westminster and two support vessels – will call in at the British sovereign base at Gibraltar for three days, beginning on August 19. In a show of force, the warships will practise ‘a range of operations’ including ‘deterring adversaries’. Mr Hammond said: ‘Since its creation under the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review, the Response Force Task Group has demonstrated its formidable strength and readiness to respond to emerging threats worldwide through a number of operations and exercises. ‘This now routine and long-planned deployment will demonstrate once again its ability to operate as a rapid reaction force on behalf of the UK and, importantly, underlines the global reach and flexibility of the modern Royal Navy.’ The deployment follows demands from the . government of Gibraltar for the coalition to beef up its naval presence . off the Rock, and calls for gunboat diplomacy from Tory MPs. Commodore Paddy McAlpine, Commander UK . Task Group, said: 'Cougar 13 is a bespoke opportunity to enhance the . Royal Navy’s enduring core skill – the ability to operate and project . power as a task group at range. In so doing, it will also remind . interested domestic and international parties of the enduring utility, . employability and interoperability of the Royal Navy. 'During . Cougar 13 we will engage with our partner nations through a series of . exercises, reinforcing our commitment and demonstrating our contribution . to security in the Mediterranean and Gulf region.' Mr Cameron broke the news that the task . force was set to sail to Mr Rajoy in the tense phone call on Wednesday . which failed to resolve the diplomatic standoff. Ready for anything: Ahead of the deployment, the Vikings of the Armoured Support Group spent last week on the ranges at Lulworth in Dorset to hone their shooting skills . Tensions: The British Foreign Office fears the proposed Spanish border charges would penalise islanders who regularly commute to Spain for work . Downing Street claimed Mr Rajoy had . offered to ‘de-escalate’ the  crisis after Mr Cameron issued a coded . warning that Britain might take Spain to the European Court of Justice . over the ‘disproportionate’ border checks. But within minutes of the call, the Spanish government insisted they were doing nothing wrong. Spanish . foreign minister Jose Garcia-Margallo has threatened to impose tolls at . the border and ban Gibraltar-bound aircraft from Spanish airspace . because the government of Gibraltar sank concrete blocks off the Rock to . deter Spanish fishermen. On the move: HMS Montrose sailing from HMNB Devonport in preparation for Operation Cougar . On the move: RFA Fort Victoria (left) and HMS Montrose will leave the UK on Monday .

That would send the strongest signal that Gibraltar is . British.’ Appeal: David Cameron asked the Spanish Prime Minister to scale back contentious border checks with the British territory, including blocking flights to Gibraltar . Access: The Spanish government raised the prospect of imposing a 50 euros (£43) charge on vehicles entering Gibraltar and closing Spanish airspace to flights heading for the Rock . On the ground, Spanish officials again forced motorists to wait for hours yesterday, imposing more border checks when they spotted UKIP deputy leader Paul Nuttall viewing their operations. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: ‘The Royal Navy’s annual Cougar deployment is long-planned and well-established. ‘Gibraltar is a strategic base for UK defence and as such Royal Navy ships visit its waters throughout the year as part of a range of regular and routine deployments.’ Warship: The Ministry of Defence stressed that the movement of the nine-vessel Response Force Task Group was 'long-planned'","Three ships including HMS Westminster to stop at Gibraltar, MoD reveals .

Vandalism: Christine Arnold, pictured at her home destroyed 80 bridal gowns with gold paint and scissors in a row over pay . A wedding dress maker has been spared jail despite going on a drunken rampage where she destroyed 80 bridal gowns with gold paint and scissors. Christine Arnold also used a hammer to smash computers and pictures at the business, causing more than £63,000 of damage in a row over pay. When the police arrived she yelled at them: 'No-one f***** with me'. The 53-year-old had arrived at the Wedding Barn in Ufton, near Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire on December 27 last year and smashed her way through its locked wooden gates. Once inside, she used a hammer to destroy computers, photo frames, a mirror and furniture at the shop. Arnold, who had also gone armed with a can of spray paint and a pair of scissors, then sprayed dozens of wedding dresses with gold paint before ripping them to shreds. She pleaded guilty to a charge of causing criminal damage but walked free from Warwick Crown Court yesterday. Arnold, from Kenilworth, was sentenced to 12 months in prison suspended for two years with 12 months supervision. Sentencing Arnold, Recorder John Taylor told her: 'This was a horrific incident. One only has to look at the photographs to see that. 'You had some dispute with John Stott [the wedding shop owner], but that was no excuse for your behaviour. 'You stoked yourself up with alcohol and you drove there and caused horrific damage, absolutely trashing it. 'You created mayhem and caused a considerable amount of distress. 'You richly deserve to go to prison, but I'm not going to send you to prison immediately. 'You need to face up to this [alcohol] problem and address it.' Prosecutor Kathryn Roughton said the Wedding Barn is a company where Arnold worked for some time last year. Police were called to the shop by the company's chauffeur - who said Arnold was at the premises and was smashing it up. By the time officers arrived, Arnold had left in her car but officers found her at a friend's house. As she was arrested Arnold told officers: 'They've been f****** my head.' Attack: Arnold had smashed her way into the Wedding Barn in Ufton, Warwickshire, before destroying as much as she could before the police arrived . Prestigious: The Wedding Barn is one of the area's main bridal gown stores, but its stock was destroyed in a spree the judge called a 'trashing' The court heard Arnold had worked at the shop with her sister for about six months and claimed she had never been paid because she did not have a formal contract. Arnold even admitted that she had left home intending to carry out the damage and had sprayed 80 or 90 wedding dresses. The court heard Arnold caused £63,268 worth of damage. Mayhem: Christine Arnold was told by the judge: 'You stoked yourself up with alcohol and caused horrific damage' by slashing and spray-painting wedding dresses (file picture) Arnold, who also had a job working in the financial services industry, had no previous convictions. Amy Jacobs, defending, said: 'Altogether they [the circumstances of the case] paint a sorry picture of a woman in crisis. 'But she has been engaging with the Recovery Partnership and is getting her drinking under control.'

Ad vans warning illegal immigrants to ‘go home’ are to be investigated by the advertising watchdog. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has launched a probe after 60 complaints were lodged over the concerns that the ads were ‘reminiscent of slogans used by racist groups to attack immigrants in the past’. The Home Office is also being investigated after claims that posters boasting of ‘106 arrests last week in your area’ were misleading. Investigation: The Home Office's 'Go Home' vans are to be probed by the Advertising Standards Agency after receiving 60 complaints . Vans displaying billboards warning overstaying migrants ‘Go home, or you'll be picked up and deported’ toured six London boroughs last month. The move caused a major coalition row, with Lib Dems Nick Clegg and Vince Cable accusing the Tories of trying to stoke up a ‘sense of fear’. But the Home Office and Downing Street insisted the scheme was ‘working’ and the hotline had received calls. Migrant groups, Labour politicians and unions also reacted angrily to the campaign and dozens of complaints were made to the advertising watchdog. The ASA has launched now a formal investigation. A spokesman said: ‘Complainants have expressed concerns that the ad, in particular the phrase 'Go Home', is offensive and irresponsible because it is reminiscent of slogans used by racist groups to attack immigrants in the past and could incite or exacerbate racial hatred and tensions in multicultural communities. Row: Labour's Chris Bryant accused the government of 'offensive stunts' ‘Separately, some complainants have challenged whether the claim “106 arrests last week in your area” is misleading. ‘They've also challenged whether it is misleading because it implies arrest is the automatic consequence of remaining in the UK without permission. We will publish our findings in due course.’ However Tory treasury minister Sajid Javid staunchly defended the campaign, which could be rolled out nationwide. He said: ‘It is a trial and the purpose of the trial is to see what is the result. ‘It is quite right that we are looking at ways to tackle illegal immigration.’ The ASA's probe is in addition to another investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) into a wave of immigration checks across the country. The EHRC launched the probe after it was claimed that the spot checks - conducted at transport hubs up and down the country - were being carried out by border officials purely on the basis of ethnicity. Labour’s shadow immigration minister Chris Bryant said: ‘This is another embarrassing blow to a Government which continues to fail to deal with immigration. ‘With more people absconding at the border and fewer illegal immigrants being returned, David Cameron and Theresa May can't even get the basics right, stumbling from one shambles to another. ‘You've got to question the Government's competence. We need effective action on immigration not offensive stunts.’ Lord Ouseley, former chief executive of the Commission for Racial Equality, said it was possible to find and remove illegal immigants and appear tough on immigration without being 'nasty'. But backbench Tory MP Peter Bone said if the pilot is effective it should be rolled out across the country. 'If this works and people voluntarily go home because of it who have been afraid to go forward before because they have been worried about getting arrested and if it does anything to tackle the evil criminal gangs that bring people here unlawfully then it's a good thing,' he told the BBC.","Billboards caused a storm after touring six London boroughs .

An astonishing £3billion portfolio of luxurious homes is set to be created by a huge sell-off of London embassies, it emerged today. Twenty diplomatic missions and residences have been readied for sale in the past half a year - and more are on the way as foreign governments try to cash in demand from wealthy buyers. The majority of the properties are expected to be converted into apartments in central areas of the capital such as Belgravia, Kensington and Holland Park, reported the London Evening Standard. Pricey: Some £40million was raised by the sale of the old Brazilian embassy (left) in Mayfair and the seven-storey Canadian High Commission (right) in the same area is expected to be sold soon for £175million . Venetia van Kuffeler, The Diplomat magazine editor, told the newspaper: ‘Dating back to the Victorian era, grand embassy buildings used to be an important visual representation of each country. ‘However with the internet and 24 hour news that isn’t so necessary as people now know a lot more about countries from around the world.’ Just this week the former European Council of Foreign Relations eight-storey building near St James’s Park was sold for £21.5million to Galliard Homes and will be converted into 35 apartments.

An Italian judge is leading a radical scheme to try and break the grip of the mafia by taking their children away from them before they become part of the family business. Roberto di Bella, president of the juvenile court in Reggio Calabria in southern Italy, says the drastic measure is the only way to tackle mafia gangs because they are built around family ties. 'We needed to find a way to break this cycle that transmits negative cultural values from father to son,' he told the BBC. Turf war: Achille Marmo was arrested after six Italians were shot dead in Duisberg, Germany, 2007 in an explosion of violence between rival mafia gangs . Calabria is home of the increasingly notorious 'Ndrangheta mafia. Less well-known than other crime families, it is now believed to be the . most powerful in Italy, controlling much of the drug trade into Europe . through South America. Domination: The 'Ndrangheta clan control much of Calabria in southerin Italy . After a huge crackdown in 2011, 110 mobsters were jailed for a total of more than 1,000 years. But the gang's stranglehold on the impoverished region remains strong. Police have found it particularly hard to penetrate the 'Ndrangheta because it is family-based and informers are rare. With this in mind, Judge di Bella felt compelled to take an alternative approach to combating organised crime. He had begun to see a number of boys in his court who were the sons of mafia bosses he had sentenced in the Nineties. Instead of seeing them follow in the . inevitable footsteps of their fathers, he made the decision to start . taking them away from their families. 'As president of the court, I took some decisions,' he told the BBC. He . began taking a keen interest in the children of well-known mafia . families aged around 14 or 15 who had 'started to acquire the mafiosi . mentality' as Di Bella puts it. Around 15 children - mostly boys - have been taken away so far and placed in care homes. They are no in prison and can visit their families at weekends. Detained: Italian police take a man into custody during a recent crackdown on the 'Ndrangheta mafia family . Di Bella says the courts are focusing on boys who are involved in low-level crimes such as stealing or vandalism and their families show little interest. 'Our objective is to show these young . men a different world from the one they grew up in,' he says. 'If you . are a boy whose father, uncle or grandfather is a mafioso, then there's . no-one who can set rules - and we provide them with a context.' The . intention is that intervening early will encourage the youngsters to . choose not to follow a life of crime through their own volition. When they are 18, they can return to their families and it will be their own decision. But it will not be an easy choice, as 'Ndrangheta expert Antonio Nicaso explains. The . 'Ndrangheta, based in Calabria in the far south of Italy, is now . believed to be the most powerful of Italy's four mafia organisations. They have grown from a rural mob to a brand-name international criminal syndicate. In the past decade, the 'Ndrangheta . has emerged as a powerful and aggressive organization, becoming one of . the world's biggest cocaine traffickers. The origins of the 'Ndrangheta are . thought to date back to shortly after Italian unification in 1861 when . secret societies were established in Calabria. The group confined its activities . to Calabria until the 1970s, after which it began to target rich . businessmen and their relatives for ransom kidnappings in northern . Italy. The organisation turned its attention to drugs in the 1990s, importing cocaine from Colombia and distributing it around Europe. Police have found it hard to penetrate the 'Ndrangheta because it is family-based and Informers are rare. However, last year police arrested around 300 alleged Mafiosi, dealing the organisation a major blow. Italy's Eurispes institute has . estimated that the 'Ndrangheta's turnover from trafficking in drugs and . arms, prostitution and extortion amounts to more than 40 billion euros a . year - the equivalent of three percent of Italy's gross domestic . product. 'There's a religious baptism and a . mafioso baptism, which is confirmed when you reach a certain age,' he told the BBC. 'So this means that, often, the children of bosses - particularly the . first-born - are predestined to follow in their father's footsteps.' The programme is still in an experimental stage, but if successful it will be rolled out in other parts of Italy.","Roberto di Bella says drastic action is only way to 'break the cycle'

Phil Newton, 81, has been putting money into the drawer at his home in Burnage for over 70 years, starting with a single shilling when he was seven. But the tens of thousands of pounds Mr Newton amassed were taken from him when three men broke into his house last week. Phil Newton, 81, had his entire life savings stolen when three men broke into his home in Burnage and stole tens of thousands of pounds from a drawer in home . The former RAF pilot avoided putting the money in a bank account for fear it would affect the amount of pension he received. Instead, he regularly put envelopes filled with £5 and £10 notes into the drawer in his house. 'I've been saving since I was seven. Over the years I would just put aside what I didn't need to live on,' he said. 'Sometimes I would use the money to buy non-essential things like a new suit or when I got my CD player, but I wasn't saving for something specific like a house. 'On the day of the burglary I came . home from the shops on my bike, and when I tried to open the front door . the chain was on from the inside. 'It was then I got a feeling something wasn't right so I went round the back and the back door was open. Detectives believe the burglars could have been watching Mr Newton's house until he went out. 'As I walked to the stairs three men ran down shouting ""we're the police"" and ran off down the road. 'I saw the bag in one man's hand but didn't think anything of it at the time. Mr Newton had been saving money since he was seven years-old, starting with a single shilling in 1938 . 'I only realised they had the money when I went upstairs. It's awful that it's gone. 'I'm not a harsh person but if they are caught I'd like to see them birched. But there's no use for moaning or for tears over these things.'

A small Idaho grocery chain has been dubbed 'Wal-Mart's worst nightmare' after recording huge profits at its 100 stores. The no frills Western-based chain WinCo offers cheaper prices as well as better employee conditions than its giant rival, according to experts who claim that the small chain could one day be national competitor. The danger for Wal-Mart is fitting given the company started with a name aping the large chain. Strength to strength: Rapidly expanding grocery chain WinCo offer lower prices and better pay and conditions for staff than most of their big rivals . WinCo keeps prices low by buying direct from suppliers and asking customers to bag their own groceries . In 1999 Waremart became WinCo and with it started a winning formula which has won it plaudits and profits. It keeps its costs low by eliminating the middleman and buying direct from suppliers often sending their own trucks to collect produce which means they get a better price. Customers are also expected to bag their own groceries and credit cards are not accepted, bringing prices down even further. And unlike WalMart, which tends to offer dozens of different brands' versions of the same item, WinCo normally stocks just one or two and little is spent on advertising or store decoration. 'While many supermarkets strive to keep within a few percentage points of Walmart Stores’ prices, WinCo Foods often undersells the massive discount chain,' Supermarket News says. And retail analyst Burt Flickinger III described WinCo rise as being 'unstoppable'. He told the Idaho Statesman: 'They’re Wal-Mart’s worst nightmare.' WinCo currently has 137 stores in 26 states, employs 15,000 members of staff and had . sales of $1.33 billion last year. They are planning to open more stores throughout 2014 and 2015 . Stores are large but not unwieldy ranging from 18,000 to 23,000 . square feet, less than half the average supermarket. Running scared? WinCo has been described by business analysts as 'Wal Mart's worst nightmare' Unlike WalMart which is notorious for offering low pay, WinCo also offers provides staff with health benefits and pensions. Retail expert Brad Tuttle told Time Magazine: 'Generally speaking, shoppers tolerate Walmart’s empty shelves and subpar customer service because the prices are so good. 'The fact that another retailer—even a small regional one—is able to compete and sometimes beat Walmart on prices, while also operating well-organized stores staffed by workers who enjoy their jobs, like their employer, and genuinely want the company to be successful.'","Western-based chain WinCo .

He is accused of telling an 85-year-old widow he needed to get fit so he could 'make love' to her . A professor knighted for his role in nursing was caught talking about having sex with an 83-year-old patient who he borrowed thousands of pounds from, a disciplinary panel was told today. Sir George Castledine, one of the country's most eminent nursing experts, allegedly told the woman who went to see him for bereavement counselling that he had to go to the gym or he 'wouldn't be able to make love' to her. The married father of three is alleged to have tried to get the son of the woman, known as Patient A, to sign a 'do not resuscitate' notice and to have accepted thousands of pounds from the pensioner who he nicknamed 'my little Tinkerbell', it is claimed. The 66 year-old was recorded on tape telling the elderly woman 'I do love you, dearly' after one of her daughters became suspicious about missing money and began recording her mother's telephone calls. The professor, who is only the second male nurse to be knighted for his healthcare work, is facing a string of misconduct allegations at the Nursing and Midwifery Council. The alleged inappropriate relationship was uncovered in August 2009 when the pensioner's daughters began secretly recording her phone calls after growing alarmed at their mother's relationship with the nurse when he began showering her with gifts of flowers, potted plants and even offered to value her paintings. The hearing was told the pensioner was illiterate and 'vulnerable' following the death of her husband in November 2008 after 59 years of marriage. She was referred to Sir George for bereavement counselling at Onneley House, part of the Institute of Ageing and Health where he was also the chief executive. Dr Mary-Teresa Deignan, representing the Nursing and Midwifery Council, told the central London hearing the 'defining moment' came when he attended a party with the pensioner celebrating the opening of her daughter's hair salon in September 2009. Dr Deignan said: 'The panel will hear witness C describe the two as though they were two long lost buddies, they were sat facing each other. Although they were not touching or holding hands it was clear at the party they were very close. The professor, who is only the second male nurse to be knighted for his healthcare work, is facing a string of misconduct allegations at the Nursing and Midwifery Council . The hearing was told the pensioner was illiterate and 'vulnerable' following the death of her husband. She was referred to Sir George for bereavement counselling at Onneley House, part of the Institute of Ageing and Health where he was also the chief executive . 'Witness C told her mother that she was very concerned about her mother but that her mother told her to 'butt out' or she would never speak to her, her sister, or her brother again.' Her daughters said they were frightened of probing the issue further because they feared losing their mother and that she would end up 'on her own and decrepit'. But in November 2009 their fears were fuelled when Sir George asked the woman's son if he would sign a do not resuscitate form for the patient- while telling the pensioner that it was in fact a do resuscitate form, it was alleged. Dr Deignan said: 'The registrant said his mother was hoping to go on a trip to Torquay and it was practice to sign a do not resuscitate form and that anyone who wanted to attend the trip had to sign one. 'Witness told the registrant that he needed time to think about it and left the house without signing the do not resuscitate form. Sir George denies the all but one of the allegations. He admits having further contact with Patient A after being warned not to . 'When the issue was raised to Patient A she explained that she had understood that she had been signing a do resuscitate form.' The hearing was also told that one of her daughters found her mother was giving Sir George money after finding two cheque stubs for a total of £2,500 in late 2009. The daughter usually co-signed her mother's cheques, but these did not have her signature. Dr Deignan said: 'Witness C will tell the panel that in 2009 she found a cheque stub for £2,000 that she had not written, and it did not say who the money should be paid out to. 'Witness C will inform the panel that she was aware that after her father died there was £13,000 in Patient A's home, but at the beginning of 2011 when witness C asked her mother if she could lend her cash to pay wages while she was away Patient A said she could only give her £5,500.' Alarmed, her daughters began secretly recording their mother's telephone calls in August 2009 and were left dismayed when they heard him tell their elderly mother: 'I love you'. Dr Deignan said one of the pensioner's daughters was so upset by the recording she 'was running around the house screaming.' adding that she had said 'it was just awful. I was so shocked it was almost like it stopped me breathing.' 'I phoned Witness C and said it was worse than I thought. I listened to the first tape but I couldn't listen to the other tapes, it made me cry. Mum sounds so distressed and upset.' The daughters said they agonised over the decision to tape their mother's calls but felt they had no other choice because their mother's interests were 'paramount'. Soon after hearing the recordings the daughters alerted bosses at the Institute he worked at about their concerns and Sir George was warned not to have any more contact with the pensioner. Sir George denies the all but one of the allegations. He admits having further contact with Patient A after being warned not to. He is a former assistant dean for the nursing faculty at Birmingham City University and a fellow of the Royal College of Nursing. In 2007, he was knighted for services to healthcare.

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . UPDATED: . 08:15 EST, 14 January 2012 . Jailed: Lorry driver Malcolm Simpson was given a six-year sentence following the double death crash . A lorry driver who was responsible for the deaths of two men in a motorway smash described the accident as 'just one of those things'. Philip Cawley and Thomas Southward were changing a tyre on the hard shoulder of the M6 at Sandbach in Cheshire when trucker Malcolm Simpson careered into them. The two were described as having 'no escape' when they were hit by the articulated lorry, which had first strayed into the third 'fast' lane - prohibited for heavy goods vehicles - and twice drifted on to the . hard shoulder before ploughing into the defenceless men. Simpson, of Selby in north Yorkshire, . was jailed for six years after a judge said he placed the security of . his load before public safety. The trucker, a lorry driver for nearly 30 years, showed no emotion as he was jailed at Chester Crown Court. The court heard how, in evidence, the defendant said he felt sorry for the losses to the victim’s families but described the accident as 'one of those things'. However, defending barrister . Simon LeBrocq said that Simpson had not intended for the the comment to sound callous and that he very much regretted what happened. Mr Cawley. 39, of Ashton in Makerfield, and Mr Southward, 69, of Haydock, St Helens, were were killed instantly in the horrifying accident on September 10, 2010. Sitting ducks: Philip Cawley (left) and Thomas Southward (right) 'stood no chance whatsoever' when they were hit by the lorry . The two men were both experienced lorry drivers and had been working for Mr Cawley's vehicle services company when a car they were towing suffered a puncture. They were described as 'sitting ducks' as they changed the tyre on the hard shoulder shortly before Simpson's lorry crashed into them. The collision was captured by a Highways Agency motorway camera, as well as the on-board camera of a VOSA vehicle which happened to be passing at the time. Another lorry driver told the how the accident was like . a scene from the film Final Destination, where he could see what was . going to happen but was powerless to stop it. Simpson, who has not driven since the accident and has been working in a care home, had denied falling asleep at the wheel and claimed he had simply not seen the two men. 'Like a scene from Final Destination': The horrifying crash was caught on CCTV (pictured) He told the court he could not remember what had happened and his defence team suggested he had suffered some kind of medical episode. After his unanimous conviction by the . jury, the Recorder of Chester, Judge Elgan Edwards said he could give no credit in sentence for a . guilty plea, for he had denied all the allegations against him and had . to be convicted by the jury. Records showed that in the previous . few days Simpson had taken a somewhat cavalier attitude to the . requirements to take proper rest breaks. That day he had been involved in at least one, if not two, earlier incidents of drifting on the motorway. Judge Edwards said: 'You should have . been warned and taken appropriate action instead of which you continued . driving and and ultimately you then drifted onto the hard shoulder and . killed two perfectly innocent men going about their job in a proper . manner.' Victims 'stood no chance whatsoever' The judge said the victims were extremely vulnerable, and they 'stood no chance whatsoever'. The defendant had said that his . employers did not like a valuable load to be parked up in a lay-by and . the judge said that he was quite satisfied he had put his job before . safety matters. It was that sort of thing which the legislation was intended to abate. He added: 'The public are entitled to . expect professional drivers of HGVs, which can cause enormous damage, . to behave responsibly. 'Professional drivers must behave responsible and behave reasonably and ensure that proper rest periods were taken.' Judge Edwards also commended the actions of another driver at the scene, who tried his best to cover up the bodies and preserve their dignity, waving traffic away from the collision. The judge praised Nicholas Medway for his public spirited actions and said that he had gone further than one would normally expect someone to do in such circumstances. Judge Edwards said the two concurrent six-year sentences were the most lenient he could pass, consistent with his public duty.","Philip Cawley and Thomas Southward 'stood no chance' when HGV hit them as they changed tyre .

"By . Ian Drury, James Chapman and Matt Chorley . PUBLISHED: . 10:37 EST, 23 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:59 EST, 23 May 2013 . David Cameron yesterday tore up an order banning troops from wearing their uniforms in public that was issued in the wake of the Woolwich attack. He is understood to have told Defence Secretary Philip Hammond he was ‘seriously dismayed’ at official guidance given to personnel in London following the murder. As the row raged in Whitehall, troops and their families posted pictures of themselves in full uniform online, in defiance of the ruling from the Ministry of Defence. Strength: Prime Minister David Cameron gave a statement in Downing Street, vowing that the terrorists will not divide Britain but make it stronger . Armed: Military personnel in uniform stand guard at Woolwich Barracks yesterday, where security has been tightened . Insisting that the ban be rescinded, . Mr Cameron told a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee in Whitehall: . ‘The best way to defeat terrorism is for everyone – including our brave . service personnel – to go about their lives as normal.’ The dressing down was a blow for Mr Hammond, who is understood to have agreed that the uniform ban should be implemented. Security had been tightened within . hours of the attack amid fears that other military personnel could be . targeted in ‘copycat’ strikes. Instructions issued to commanders said . that troops should be ‘advised to maintain a low public profile until . further information is received; uniforms should be concealed while in a . public place, particularly when travelling alone or from home to unit. Defiant: Soldiers walk outside Royal Artillery Barracks, Woolwich Headquarters, close to the scene where a soldier was murdered in John Wilson Street . Floral tributes, and a T-shirt, have been left outside the Royal Military Barracks, near the scene where a solider was brutally murdered in broad daylight . ‘Specifically in London District, . uniform is not to be worn outside units or when travelling to and from . units unless authorised at military one-star level or above.’ Boris . Johnson arrived at Downing Street for the Cobra meeting with a warning . that the Woolwich knife attack must not be blamed on British foreign . policy. 'It is completely . wrong to blame this killing on the religion of Islam, but it is also . equally wrong to try to draw any link between this murder and British . foreign policy or the actions of British forces who are risking their . lives abroad for the sake of freedom. 'The fault lies wholly and exclusively in the warped and deluded mindset of the people who did it. 'What we need now is, for the sake of the victim and the sake of his family, for those killers to be brought to justice. 'I think I want to pay particular tribute, not just to the work of the police and security services yesterday. 'But . also, above all, to the people of Woolwich, who showed such exemplary . courage and bravery in a very difficult situation indeed.' 'The . people of London should take their cue, from the behaviour of the . people of Woolwich yesterday, who showed such astonishing natural . courage in dealing with an appalling event, and who stood up to these . killers. 'I think that . that’s the spirit of London, and that’s what I would call upon people to . do today: go about their lives in the normal way.' But current and former servicemen . defied the ruling by posting pictures online. Former soldier Glenn Rees, . of Maesteg in Wales, was among those who posted a picture of himself in . uniform. He wrote on Facebook: ‘The . Government’s decision to ban military personnel wearing uniform in . public whilst investigations are being carried out is ridiculous! Backing down already! ‘Been out of the Forces for three . years to the day … Least I could do for this innocent soldier and his . family. Brothers Unite!!’ The heightened state of alert was a . throwback to the 1970s and 1980s, when military personnel were ordered . to wear civilian clothes on the streets because of the threat from the . IRA. In recent years, troops have been . encouraged to wear their uniforms in public. But jihadist websites have . urged Muslim extremists to target those in uniform as revenge for . British forces fighting in Afghanistan. Colonel Richard Kemp, a former . commander in Afghanistan, said he opposed the restrictions, explaining: . ‘As we saw in this case you don’t need to have somebody in uniform, you . just need to have someone who knows a bit about soldiers and does a bit . of observation in the vicinity of a barracks and can identify a soldier . very quickly.’ General Sir David Richards, the Chief of the Defence . Staff, also lent his support to Mr Cameron’s decision. He said he believed it was an . ‘isolated incident’, adding: ‘There is no reason at all why we should . not wear our uniforms with pride, but on a common sense basis.’ Ann Annis, 49, whose 22-year-old son . Simon died in a Taliban bomb blast in 2009, said: ‘It’s a sad reflection . of Britain when they’re being advised not to wear their uniforms but to . go out in civvies. Defiance: Two women soldiers walk along a path in Woolwich shortly after the murder in south-east London . ‘I don’t want them hurt, of course, . but they should be allowed to wear their tunics with pride. 'The best way to defeat terrorism is for everyone – including our brave service personnel – to go about their lives as normal' Prime Minister David Cameron . 'It used to . be that our soldiers in uniforms were applauded on the streets but now . the country has become too lily-livered.’ Sources close to the Defence Secretary . said the ban was part of a raft of ‘immediate and automatic reactive . security measures’ after the attack. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: . ‘Following a review of the situation this morning, a decision has been . taken to relax some of these temporary measures imposed yesterday.’ The Woolwich atrocity was an attack on the British way of life, David Cameron said yesterday. But, speaking outside Downing Street after chairing the crisis committee Cobra, he insisted the outrage would serve to unite different communities. ‘What happened in Woolwich yesterday has sickened us all,’ said the Prime Minister. ‘The people who did this were trying to divide us. They should know something like this will only bring us together, make us stronger.’ Mr Cameron said the attack was a betrayal of Islam and ‘solely and purely’ the responsibility of the accused. ‘This view is shared by every community in our country,’ he added. ‘This was not just an attack on Britain and on the British way of life; it was also a betrayal of Islam and of the Muslim communities who give so much to our country. There is nothing in Islam that justifies this truly dreadful act.’ The Prime Minister said Britain would be resolute in its ‘stand against violent extremism’. ‘We will never give in to terror or terrorism in any of its forms,’ he added. ‘We will defeat violent extremism by standing together, by backing our police and security services, and above all by challenging the poisonous narrative of extremism on which this violence feeds. Britain works with our international partners to make the world safe from terrorism – terrorism that has taken more Muslim lives than any other religion. It is an utter perversion of the truth to pretend anything different.’ President Barack Obama said: ‘The United States stands resolute with the United Kingdom, our ally and friend, against violent extremism and terror. ‘There can be absolutely no justification for such acts, and our thoughts and prayers are with the family of the victim, the police and security services responding to this horrific act and the communities they serve, and the British people.’ Baroness Warsi, minister for faith and communities, said she had been ‘incredibly impressed’ by the way in which British Muslim communities had ‘unreservedly and unitedly condemned’ the barbaric acts.","Military chiefs imposed automatic ban on uniforms outside bases .

The six-count grand jury indictment charges Hernandez with killing 27-year-old Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional football player from Boston who was dating the sister of Hernandez's girlfriend. Prosecutors claim that Hernandez, 23, orchestrated . Lloyd's killing because he was upset at him for talking to people . Hernandez had problems with at a nightclub days earlier. Hernandez and two other men, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, allegedly picked Lloyd up at his home . in Dorchester early on June 17 and then drove to . the industrial park. The body was found by a jogger later that day. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Charges: Aaron Hernandez, pictured smiling at his hearing today, has been indicted on a first-degree murder charge in the death of a semi-pro football player, Odin Lloyd, whose body was found near his home . In court: Hernandez, pictured in Attleboro, Massachusetts today, faces life behind bars if convicted . Nonchalant: Hernandez, 23, looked relaxed as he appeared in court, two months after his arrest . Hernandez, who was dropped by the . Patriots within hours of his arrest on June 26, could face life in . prison without parole if convicted. Hernandez appeared briefly in Attleboro District Court on Thursday for a previously scheduled probable-cause hearing and looked relaxed. Victim: The body of 27-year-old Odin Lloyd was found on June 17 about a mile from Hernandez's home . At one point he even mouthed the words 'I love you' to someone in the courtroom, the Boston Herald reported. The indictment also contains weapons counts, according to the Fall River division of Bristol County Superior Court. Hernandez . pleaded not guilty to murder and weapons charges in June, and he is . being held without bail at a county jail. His lawyers say the case . against him is circumstantial and they're confident he will be able to . clear his name. Shortly before Lloyd's death, authorities say, Lloyd sent his sister text messages. He asked if she had seen who he was with when he got into the car in Boston. Then he indicated who it was in a way that Lloyd's family said he knew his sister would understand. 'NFL,' he wrote. 'Just so you know.' Moments later, authorities say, Lloyd was dead after gunshots rang out in an unpaved construction area by a warehouse after he apparently got out of the car for what he thought was a bathroom break. Authorities have not said who fired the shots, but according to court documents, Ortiz told police in Florida that Wallace said it was Hernandez. Appearance: Hernandez is lead from a sheriff's van into a courthouse in Attleboro on Thursday . Supporters: People shout support for Hernandez as he returns to the van after the probable-cause hearing . Loss: A woman wears a button with a picture of Odin Lloyd as she listens during the court proceedings . Wallace has pleaded not guilty to a charge of accessory to murder after the fact. Ortiz has pleaded not guilty to a firearm charge. Both are being held in jail without bail. Authorities have said they haven't found the murder weapon, which they believe was a .45-caliber Glock pistol, but warrants released earlier this month suggested Hernandez may have asked his fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, to dispose of it. Investigators did recover a magazine for .45-caliber bullets in Hernandez's Hummer as well as ammunition of the same caliber inside a condo he rented in Franklin, Massachusetts. Authorities also recovered a shell casing . that matched those found at the homicide scene after tracking the . rental car Hernandez was in the night Lloyd died. Since then, Boston police have asked . police in Hernandez's hometown of Bristol, Connecticut for their help . with the probe into Lloyd's homicide as well as a 2012 double homicide . near a Boston nightclub. Questions: Warrants earlier this month claimed that Shayanna Jenkins, Hernandez's fiancee (pictured in court earlier this month), may have helped him dispose of the weapon that killed Odin . Allegations: . Carlos Ortiz, (center), is shown during a hearing in court in Bristol, . Connecticut in June. He faces a gun charge but has told authorities . that Hernandez confessed to the murder . A . Connecticut police lieutenant said authorities searched the home of . Hernandez's uncle, seizing an SUV sought in the double killing that had . been rented in Hernandez's name. Two . men died in the July 2012 shooting in Boston's South End, with . witnesses reporting that gunfire came from inside a gray SUV with Rhode . Island tags. Boston police . haven't reported any arrests in the deaths of Daniel Jorge Correia de . Abreu, 29, and Safiro Teixeira Furtado, 28, and won't comment on whether . Hernandez is a suspect. Hernandez is also facing civil litigation after a Connecticut man filed a lawsuit asserting the former player shot him in the face in February after they argued at a Miami strip club. Alexander Bradley, who says he lost an eye, told police at the time he didn't know who shot him. In July, a judge ordered him to appear before the Fall River, Massachusetts, grand jury hearing evidence against Hernandez in Lloyd's homicide.

Six-week-old Elizabeth and twin sister Victoria were on hand to witness parents Kyle Wiggins and Leighanne Crampton pick up their grades . During the 13 weeks leading up to their birth, Kyle and Leighanne had to go to hospital every day - severely damaging their attendance at school . The students have endured a stressful couple of months but that was not caused by the dreaded wait for results. The Park Community School pupils in Havant, Hampshire, who only discovered Leighanne was pregnant when she was four months gone, learnt their daughters' may not survive because of a dangerous foetal condition. The condition, called twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, occurs when one twin gets all the nutrients. It meant that during the 13 weeks leading up to their birth, Kyle and Leighanne had to go to hospital every day - severely damaging their attendance at school. When they were born, the twins had to stay in hospital for a further four weeks after being born by caesarean section at just 33 weeks. But they're now living with Leighanne's parents, brother and sister at home. Despite missing a lot of time off school, teachers were in no doubt that they would both do well . Pictured: Kyle Wiggins feeds twin Victoria whilst Leighanne Crampton, feeds twin Elizabeth. The babies suffered twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, which occurs when one twin gets all the nutrients . Leighanne said: 'It's amazing to have them home. 'I'm happy with my results but if I hadn't had so much drama I could've done even better! 'We had both planned our future after school and I had a place lined up to be an apprentice travel agent. 'I also had an interview for an accountancy apprenticeship when I found out I was pregnant. 'It was a real shock because I was already 16 weeks gone but a few weeks later the doctors told us to get ready to go to London because the twins had twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome.' Leighanne, known as Lilly, took eight GCSEs, scoring two Bs in geography and IT and a further six Cs. She also collected a distinction in a BTEC course in travelling and tourism and intends to start an apprenticeship as soon as she is able. Meanwhile, boyfriend Kyle took nine GCSEs, picking up two Bs and seven Cs, securing his place on an engineering apprenticeship. The students have endured a stressful couple of months but that was not caused by the dreaded wait for results . He said: 'I've always loved cars and been interested in how they work so an engineering apprenticeship was just the right thing. 'I was worried for a bit when we first found out Lilly was pregnant but I knew we would work our way round it. 'I want to get the best job I can to provide for Lilly and the kids. They are just perfect.' Despite missing a lot of time off school, teachers were in no doubt that they would both do well. Stuart Cavanagh, who is in charge of student progress, said: 'They're both very good students who have worked hard despite a rather complicated year. 'Both did well and they're very well adjusted pupils who are looking to carry on with their education and make the very best of their lives.' Elizabeth was the 'donor' twin which meant, in the womb, her sister was taking all of her nutrients too. She was born weighing 3lbs 12ozs and has a hole in her heart, which requires regular medical attention, but is otherwise healthy. Victoria was born weighing 4lb 12oz and is thriving.","Kyle Wiggins and Leighanne Crampton collected their GCSE grades with new twin daughters Elizabeth and Victoria .

A cruel farmer shot two innocent dogs with a bolt-gun and left them to die a slow and painful death, a court heard. Simon Tidswell, 46, came across the family pets after they escaped from their owner and were left with him for safekeeping. The farmer, who lives in Oxenhope, West Yorkshire, shot the dogs, Frank and Macy at point blank range, and left their bodies under a pile of wood in his barn, it was reported. Macy (left) and Frank (centre) escaped from the open boot of their owner's car and ran off before she could find them. They were found by a local man who left them in Simon Tidswell's care in the hope their owner would soon come for them . The dogs were found by John Hodgson who was out walking his own pet, and given to Tidswell to look after in March. Instead . the farmer, who claimed to be a trained slaughterman, killed the . animals, shooting them in such a way that inflicted a slow and painful . death. Police vet, . Simon Newby carried out a postmortem, concluding there was 'a very small . chance they were killed instantly', as Tidswell had missed the brain of . one dog and slightly damaged the other's when shooting them. His brutal killing of the animals has left their owner, Zoe Kerr devastated. She said: 'Tidswell's unforgivable killing of Macy and Frank has ripped a massive hole in our family. 'To have them taken from us in such cruel circumstances was devastating. 'The . fact that they had been caught and were held by a well-meaning member . of the public, but were then taken by Tidswell was heartbreaking.' Zoe Kerr is devastated after the loss of her two dogs who were killed in 'cold blood'. Her only pet now is Macy's pup, Dave who is a Husky cross . Ms Kerr recalled how the dogs, who were microchipped and wore collars, jumped out of her car and ran off, leaving Macy's pup, Dave behind. The 36 year-old hairdresser quickly formed a search party and contacted local residents, including Tidswell whose farm she visited, only to be told he hadn't seen the dogs. 'I was frantic and together with lots of friends and people from Young . Farmers I organised a search party and we covered about 90 per cent of . Oxenhope Moor and looked for them well after nightfall without success,' Ms Kerr said. The following morning, the wife of Mr Hodgson who had found the dogs, phoned her to let her know her husband had put them on a lead and left them in Tidswell's care. Ms Kerr then contacted the police who searched the run-down property in Pennine Hills and found the dogs' lifeless bodies under a heap of wood in the barn. The 46 year-old conceded two counts of criminal damage and admitted failing to ensure the needs of an animal were met before Bradford Magistrate's Court. He was sentenced to 12 weeks in jail and has been ordered to complete 120 hours of unpaid work in the community. His crimes have left Zoe and her four year-old daughter Esme who live in nearby Haworth, distraught. 'For weeks afterwards, my troubled . sleep was plagued with nightmares and dreadful images of what he'd done . to my pets and I constantly faced the thought of them being taken by . him, going willingly with him, and then being shot in the head with a . bolt gun when they had done nothing wrong. 'When . I called at his farm he said he'd not seen them. I'm heartbroken to . think that as he lied to me my two dogs were lying dead in his barn. 'What he'd done instead was tie them up in his barn and shoot them at point blank range with a bolt gun.' Ms Kerr said the man who found the dogs in the first place, Mr Hodgson, is devastated after leaving them with the evil farmer. 'I'm . a country type and understand that if my dogs had been worrying sheep, . the farmer would be fully within his rights to shoot them, but they had . not touched any lambs and were completely innocent. 'They were killed in cold blood and for no other reason than malice. 'I take full responsibility for them escaping and running away. I feel so guilty, it's killing me. 'Now I'm just left with Dave, who is Macy's pup.' Animal . rights group Caged, which is campaigning for bolt guns to be banned, . staged a demonstration outside the court and said Tidswell's sentence . was too lenient. Spokesperson . Rita James said: 'It's disgusting. It's absolutely saying to everyone . else out there you can use a bolt gun and you are going to walk free.' Tidswell refused to comment after the hearing.

Pony patches: A new class of pilots is choosing to wear a patch in reference to the kids show 'My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic' A new group of Air Force pilots are comfortable enough in their masculinity to wear a 'My Little Pony' patch on their uniforms. The patch was chosen by the 24 student pilots of class 14-05 at Vance Air Force Base - one of four centers in the U.S. where commissioned officers are trained to become professional pilots. Their patch is an allusion to the sub-culture of 'bronies', male fans of the children's show 'My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic'. The current show is a reboot of the 1980s cartoon and line of plastic pony toys. The new show has surprisingly spurned a sub-culture of male fans, and an increasing amount of these 'bronies' are members of the military. But . according to Vance Air Force Base spokesman 1st Lieuntenant Thomas . Barger, this class's patch was a joke and not reflective of their . appreciation for the show. 'It was kind of a fluke,' Lt Barger told Air Force Times. Lt . Barger explained that a student proposed the 'My Little Pilot: Flying . is Magic' design as a joke during the slideshow presentation of patch . options. 'That patch . made it all the way through the approval process and is even more ironic . since the class never really wanted it in the first place, ' Lt Barger . said. 'They thought it was so off the wall that it was hilarious. They . have embraced the irony and the humor of the patch an in so doing have . fostered closer ties with each other.' But . the patch is far from unusual. Class patches usually contain some . reference to current pop culture, like the game angry birds or the movie . Austin Powers. Past patches: Class patches are usually humorous and contain some reference to current pop culture. For example: a Pabst Blue Ribbon patch, left, and an Angry Birds patch, right . And that's exactly the point. 'We . train world-class pilots who will go on to defend out great nation. Fostering camaraderie, morale and unity on a regular basis and through . small means - like a tastefully humorous patch - enhances our ability to . complete the mission when working as a team is essential,' Lt Barger told Medium. But not all of the pilots-in-training were happy to wear the patch. One commenter on brony site Equestria Daily, who has a son in class 14-04, witnessed a few trainees unhappy with the design. 'There . was at least one non-brony who straight up refused to wear it and I . overheard another complaining to his mom about it,' the commenter wrote. 'But the fight instructor (who was a captain) was wearing it and he had . no problems with his masculinity.' These discontent pilots may be reluctant to wear a patch that connects them to the real group of military bronies. Passion: These military men call themselves 'Bronies' as they wear patches on their uniforms identifying themselves as fans of the show, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic . The show's fanbase among members of the military began about two years ago when the show first began to air. Nearly 9,000 people have 'liked' a Facebook page called 'Military Bronies.' The page highlights various members of the military in patrol situations while wearing the My Little Pony patch. There are variations of the patch that typically include a cloud with a red, yellow and blue lightning bolt. 'Worth protecting': The show geared toward young girls has had a fanbase among members of the military, which started about three years ago when the show first began to air . The design symbolizes a 'rainbow dash,' which is used on the show. Administrators of the Facebook page said today that they do not advocate for servicemen to use the patches, especially if it goes against the rules of the military. On the Facebook page, an administrator said: 'Regardless of how easy it is for others to claim this, we DO NOT promote wearing of unauthorized patches, badges or insignia on your uniform. 'We do not recommend you do ANYTHING that goes against the regulations of your branch of service.' Together: The phenomenon came to light as men in uniform joined the 4,000 fans gathered at the 2012 BronyCon. The most recent BronyCon in Baltimore, Maryland attracted 8,000 attendees . A spokeswoman for the Pentagon told FoxNews.com that the military does not support unauthorized patches on uniforms. One soldier, Ken 'Derpy' Catlin, defended the fanbase and its connection to the military. He said: 'You, the bronies, have taught me that there are things and people worth protecting; things bigger and more important than myself.' A National Guard member named Darius told Buzzfeed.com that he was amazed to see how welcoming other fans were at a brony convention. 'We barely made it up to the top steps and everyone outside was cheering for us,' he said. 'I started clapping because I figured if everyone else was clapping I’d do it too. Then my friend was like, ""no dude, they’re clapping for us.""' 'Cheering': Military members have said that their passion for My Little Pony has been received with great acceptance by others and has strengthened their beliefs in the military . The first BronyCon held in June 2011 and attracted only about 100 people who trickled into some . meeting rooms in Manhattan. But the fanbase has grown exponentially and the most recent BronyCon held in Baltimore, Maryland last weekend had an attendance of about 8,000. Ongoing: My Little Pony has been around longer than the start of its current show as Hasbro released the first toys in 1983, leading to television specials, a movie and a TV series . In 1983, Hasbro released the first My Little Pony toys, which became popular among young girls, leading to television specials, a movie and the first TV series that ran from 1986 to 1987. The brand stuck around through the years, languishing in relative anonymity. But all that changed when Hasbro hired animator Lauren Faust, who breathed new life into the My Little Pony concept by creating the Friendship is Magic series. Faust had worked on The Powerpuff Girls and Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends before dreaming up the land of Equestria, where My Little Pony characters like Twilight Sparkle, Apple Jack, Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie get go on exciting adventures.","The class patch for a new batch of Air Force pilots plays on the show 'My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic'

Counter terrorism police started a criminal investigation last night into thousands of secret intelligence files obtained by The Guardian newspaper. Scotland Yard said documents seized from David Miranda, partner of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, contained ‘highly sensitive material ... which could put lives at risk’. Carrying documents that could be useful to terrorists carries a maximum ten-year jail sentence under the controversial Terrorism Act 2000. Challenge: David Miranda, pictured with his partner Glenn Greenwald, has won a bid to stop the British authorities from using the data they seized from him at Heathrow on Sunday . Officers who questioned the . 28-year-old Brazilian for nearly nine hours at Heathrow have now begun . an international investigation into how he was carrying ‘tens of . thousands’ of pages of material including secret files leaked by ex-CIA . analyst Edward Snowden. He . was travelling en route from Berlin to Rio de Janeiro on Sunday, on a . flight paid for by The Guardian, when he was stopped by police. His . partner Mr Greenwald has written several stories based on the documents . leaked from the US National Security Agency. After . Mr Miranda’s detention it emerged that David Cameron had explicitly . authorised the destruction of computers at The Guardian offices which . are believed to have held sensitive details. Challenge: Mr Miranda's solicitor Gwendolen Morgan outside the High Court in London . Victory: Ms Morgan outside court following the awarding of an interim injunction . The . police investigation is likely to explore whether Mr Miranda and . journalists at The Guardian were in breach of the Terrorism Act 2000. The law states that a person is committing an offence if he or she . collects or makes a record of information likely to be useful to a . terrorist. Last night Scotland Yard remained tight-lipped over whether detectives would be taking in journalists for questioning. Speaking . at the Edinburgh International Book Festival, Guardian editor Alan . Rusbridger said he did not know if he would be investigated. ‘It looks . like they’re mounting a criminal investigation into persons unknown,’ he . said. Asked about the . investigation, he said: ‘I don’t know anything about it. All I know is . that they’ve said they’re threatening to prosecute someone.’ Controversy: The Guardian's computer components, including the motherboard and solid-state hard drive destroyed in the interests of national security . Earlier . in the day the High Court heard that the Metropolitan Police had taken . possession of ‘tens of thousands of pages of material’ from Mr Miranda’s . electronic equipment. Judges . ruled that the security services could examine the seized material for . national security purposes and investigate whether Mr Miranda is a . person who is or has been concerned with the commission, preparation or . instigation of acts of terrorism. Jonathan . Laidlaw, QC, representing the Met, said the data contains ‘highly . sensitive material the disclosure of which would be gravely injurious to . public safety’. He . said the investigation was being carried out by counter terrorism . officers, but declined to give further details. ‘I am not prepared to . alert defendants here or abroad about the criminal investigation that . has begun,’ he added. Mr . Miranda’s lawyers had sought an injunction to prevent access to the . data, arguing his detention was unlawful and threatened ‘journalistic . sources whose confidential information is contained in the material . seized’. Row: David Cameron asked Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood to contact the Guardian about the classified material handed over by Edward Snowden, which led to the destruction of hard drives . It has been confirmed that Theresa May (pictured) knew that Mr Miranda would be detained . They said he had . had nine items, including his laptop, mobile phone, memory cards and . DVDs, taken during his detention on Sunday. Speaking . after the case Gwendolen Morgan, from law firm Bindmans, said the . Government now has seven days to ‘prove there is a genuine threat to . national security’. She added that she knew ‘very little’ about the . criminal inquiries. Last . night a police spokesman said: ‘The Metropolitan Police Service is . pleased that the High Court has rejected an attempt to prevent further . examination of material seized during the detention of a man under . Schedule 7 at Heathrow Airport. ‘We . welcome the decision of the court which allows our examination of the . material – containing thousands of classified intelligence documents – . to continue in order to protect life and national security. ‘Initial . examination of material seized has identified highly sensitive . material, the disclosure of which could put lives at risk.’ A . Guardian spokesman said: ‘It remains our position that David Miranda . was involved in legitimate journalistic activity. We have no details of . any criminal inquiry launched today and have not had any contact with . the police regarding this matter.’ The . Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation has said he will examine . the use of anti-terror powers to detain Mr Miranda.

The NHS has spent £1.4 billion on redundancy packages for staff in the last three years with some receiving packages of more than £600,000, figures show. Some 2,299 bureacrats have been handed six-figure golden goodbyes since 2010 after their posts were axed under the Government’s health reforms. Yet as many as a fifth have already walked in to new jobs within the health service and thousands more are expected to follow over the coming months. Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham says 'the true cost of David Cameron's NHS re-organisation is slowly revealing itself' after figures showed £1.4billion has been spent on staff redundancies in the past three years . Labour’s shadow health secretary Andy Burnham accused the Government of ‘siphoning’ billions away from front line care to fund the lavish exit packages of executives. NHS staff typically receive one month’s pay for every year served although senior managers can usually negotiate far more lucrative exit packages. The highest is believed to have been awarded to Nicholas Hicks, the former director of health at the now defunct Milton Keynes Primary Care Trust, who received around £600,000 when his post was abolished in April. Under NHS rule, staff can be rehired and still take their redundancy package as long as they do not start their new job for one month. It is not known whether Mr Hicks has since been re-employed within the health service. The Government’s health reforms officially came into force in April and saw hundreds of Primary Care Trusts and Strategic Health Trusts abolished and replaced by GP-led organisations called . Andy Burnham said: ‘The true cost of David Cameron’s NHS re-organisation is slowly revealing itself. ‘At a time when the NHS needs every penny it can get, we have a Prime Minister handing out gold-plated, six-figure pay-offs to thousands of managers and P45s to thousands of nurses. ‘Billions have been siphoned out of the NHS front-line to pay for an unnecessary re-organisation no-one voted for and David Cameron personally promised would not happen. It is a colossal waste of money. ‘The money he has wasted on pay-outs for managers could instead have prevented the thousands of nurse redundancies we have seen on this Prime Minister’s watch. It will be galling for any nurses who have lost their jobs to see the sickening scale of these pay-outs.’ Only last week NHS figures showed that almost 5,000 nursing posts have been axed since the Coalition came to power in April 2010. Although the health service’s budget has been ring-fenced, hospitals and health trusts have been ordered by Whitehall to save billions from their budgets and many have resorted to shedding front line posts. Matthew Sinclair of the Taxpayers Alliance was quick to slam the new figures . Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the Taxpayer’s Alliance, said: ‘There is a severe danger that golden goodbyes for senior staff in the health service could undermine any savings the Government reforms could bring. ‘If there wasn’t a ring fence around health spending then may be NHS executives wouldn’t be so cavalier with their budgets by awarding such lavish payoffs.’ Figures obtained by Labour from the Department of Health’s annual accounts show that more than 32,000 managers have received redundancies totalling £1.4 billion. They included 330 pay-offs of more than £200,000, 513 of between £150,000 and £200,000 and 1456 of between £100,000 and £150,000. But in July a report by the National Audit Office pointed out that a fifth of the staff made redundant had already found new jobs within the health service. And with around 4,500 posts in the newly-created bodies still to be filled, many more are expected to follow suit. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Last year we started changes that put doctors and nurses in the driving seat as they are best placed to take decisions about care for their patients. ‘The changes made as a result of the reforms mean a huge net gain for the taxpayer. They will save £5.5 billion during this Parliament and £1.5 billion every year thereafter, to be reinvested back into patient care.’","More than 2,000 bureaucrats have received six-figure golden goodbyes since 2010 .

Child poverty is now a bigger problem than during the 1960s, a damning report to be published this week has found. The report was carried out by the National Children's Bureau and warns that Britain is at risk of becoming a place where 'children's lives are so polarised that rich and poor live in separate, parallel worlds.' It blames a 'failure of political will' has resulted in poorer children having fewer chances in life today. The report compares children's lives with data collected from a study called Born To Fail published in 1969. It found that around 3.6million children are now living in relative poverty today compared with 2million in the late 1960s. According to the report, a child from a disadvantage background is less likely to develop as quickly by the age of four than a child from a more affluent family. Children living in deprived areas are also more likely to be the victim of an unintentional injury or accident at home and are nine times less likely to have green spaces to play. While boys living in deprived areas are three times more likely to be obese than boys growing up in affluent areas compared with girls who are twice as likely to be obese. It also notes that 63 per cent of children living in poverty have at least one parent or carer who is working. The report reads: 'Today, although there have been some improvements, overall the situation appears to be no better, and in some respects has got worse.' The charity says that if Britain tried to be more like other European countries, there would be less children dying from unintentional injuries, 320,000 more teenagers would be in education or training and nearly 45,000 11-year-olds would not be obese. The report compares children's lives with data collected from a study called Born To Fail published in 1969 . The charity is calling on the government to do more to stop the widening gap between children living in poverty and children from more affluent families. The report says: 'The government made a commitment to protect pensioner benefits but there has been no equivalent commitment to protect children living in the poorest families or to tackle child poverty.' Dr Hilary Emery, chief executive of the National Children’s Bureau, said: 'Our analysis shows that despite some improvements, the inequality and disadvantage suffered by poorer children 50 years ago still persists today. 'There is a real risk that as a nation we are sleep walking into a world where children grow up in a state of social apartheid, with poor children destined to experience hardship and disadvantage just by accident of birth, and their more affluent peers unaware of their existence. 'All our children should have the opportunity to fulfil their potential regardless of their circumstances. We cannot afford to let them grow up in such an unequal ‘them and us’ society in which the talents of the next generation are wasted, leaving them cut adrift to become a costly burden to the economy rather than a productive asset. 'This is a critical moment of opportunity to tackle the child poverty and inequality that has been a permanent feature in our country for five decades. 'Government has a major role to play in leading the way to address this but there must also be a wider mobilisation of efforts and resources led by politicians from every party and involving charities, businesses and communities all playing a part in having greater expectations for every child.'","The report was carried out by leading charity National Children's Bureau .

Gastric operations should be the last resort, said Health Minister Simon Burns, but numbers are rising . Gastric band surgery, which is cheaper but less effective, is also being increasingly used. Some 1,316 operations were carried out in England in 2011/12 – twice as many as five years earlier, figures from the NHS Information Centre show. Many more operations would have been paid for privately.Gastric bypass operations typically cost the NHS between £8,000 and £14,000 per patient, while banding costs £5,000 to £7,000, meaning the NHS spent up to £85million on the operations last year. Experts attribute the rise to a greater acceptance of the safety and effectiveness of weight-loss surgery, and to growing numbers of people becoming hugely overweight. NHS guidelines say patients must have tried all other weight-loss methods and be dangerously obese, with a BMI, or body mass index, of 40-plus. To have a BMI of 40, a woman who is 5ft 4in would have to weigh just over 17 stone. Dr David Haslam, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘The gastric bypass is among the clinically effective and cost-effective procedures in the whole field of medicine and even the most cynical, fat-phobic taxpayer should welcome the rise.’ But Paul Sacher, co-founder of Mend, a group that provides free, healthy-lifestyle programmes for families, said: ‘It is extremely concerning to see the number of gastric bypass operations taking place in England is continuing to dramatically increase. 'It’s important that families get the help and support they need early on before their obesity reaches the severe stage.’ Previous research from Imperial College London suggest numbers have risen because more obese patients are aware surgery can help them. The British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society (BOMSS) said gastric bypass operations had proven to be the most effective surgery to ensure long-term weight loss. The society has now called on the Department of Health to guarantee patients have equal access to the treatment. Gastric Bypass . Weight-loss operations, sometimes called . 'bariatric surgery', work by restricting the amount of nutrients that . can be digested and absorbed by the intestine. Gastric banding involves reducing the size of the stomach with a band fitted around it, while a gastric bypass re-routes food to a small stomach pouch created by surgeons. A third, less frequently used procedure, removes a portion of the stomach. The figures for NHS hospitals in England show a total of 18,577 gastric bypass and 7,650 gastric band operations were carried out between April 2006 and March 2012. There were 433 surgical procedures to remove gastric bands over the same period. NHS figures also show 4,581 gastric band maintenance operations were completed between April 2009 and March 2012. Weight loss after a gastric bypass is usually more impressive than after a gastric band, according to the NHS website. Most people with a gastric band will lose around half their excess body weight, whereas the majority of patients with a gastric bypass will lose around two-thirds of the excess body weight. The risk of any sort of complication after a gastric band is around one in 10 compared to one in five for a gastric bypass. The risk of death shortly after a gastric band is around one in 200 compared to one in 100 for a gastric bypass. Weight loss surgery . Patients are required to take nutritional supplements for the rest of their lives following a gastric bypass procedure. BOMSS president Alberic Fiennes said: . 'There is compelling evidence that weight-loss surgery to treat the . most severely affected is one of the most clinically effective, safe and . cost effective treatments available. 'There are about 1.5 million such . adults in the UK. They face premature death, disease and disability . brought on as a direct result of their condition. 'These can be prevented, improved or . eliminated by surgery. While the increase in bariatric surgery is . welcomed by the BOMSS and the Royal College of Surgeons, we remain . concerned that there is unequal access to treatment across the UK. 'We therefore call on the Department . of Health to invest in a long term strategy to ensure that all patients . have equal access to this life-saving treatment.' Mr Fiennes added: 'Evidence suggests . that gastric bypass operations may be more effective in the long-term. It also has also been shown to bring about a direct and immediate . improvement in patients with type 2 diabetes, in addition to the . benefits of weight loss.' Health minister Simon Burns said: 'We want people to live healthier lives so they do not need to resort to surgery, but as a last resort, doctors can advise procedures like these are undertaken. 'We are working with charities, local government and industry to make it easier for people to make better choices to prevent obesity in the first place. 'This year a third of meals and takeaways served from popular high street chains will contain calorie information and over a million families are involved in our Change4Life campaign - helping people to eat well and move more.' Serious surgery: These is a 1 in 100 risk that a patient will die soon after having a gastric bypass .","18,577 gastric bypass and 7,650 gastric band operations were carried out between April 2006 and March 2012 .
NHS spent up to £81million on gastric bypasses and up to £10.5million on gastric bands last year .
Risk of complications are 1 in five for bypasses and 1 in 10 for bands ."
