"By . Pete Jenson . Barcelona will make Lionel Messi the world’s highest-paid player, with the four-time Ballon d'Or winner poised to earn more than £335,000 per week. That is the pledge of club president Josep Maria Bartomeu just two days after the Argentina star's hat-trick defeated Real Madrid and put Barca back in the title race. 'We all want Messi to be the best-paid player in the world and that is what we are working on,' said Bartomeu. 'Right now we are concentrating on the competitions we are in but it will happen soon. Centre of attention: Lionel Messi trains with his Barcelona team-mates on Tuesday afternoon . Top dog: Messi could become the highest-paid player in the world, ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo . High spirits: Ronaldo (right) and Karim Benzema (left) prepare for Real Madrid's game against Sevilla . Superstars: Messi is poised to earn more than Ronaldo (right) and world's most expensive player Gareth Bale . 'Nobody here wants to sell Messi. You cannot sell Leo. He arrived here when he was 13 and he is one of ours.' Barcelona made their first offer to Messi’s father and agent, Jorge, earlier this year. It is understood the offer, which included ending his entitlement to 100 per cent of his image rights, did not impress the player and led to a freezing of relations between club and record goalscorer. The situation reached crisis point in late 2013 when vice-president Javier Faus said: 'I don’t know why this ""senor"" needs another contract anyway because we improved his deal only six months ago.' Messi responded by saying Faus knew . 'nothing about football' and stories confirming that various clubs . including several from the Premier League had made, or would be willing . to make, offers to buy Messi began to surface. But the landscape has changed at Barcleona in recent weeks with the departure of Sandro Rosell. Magician: Messi scored a hat-trick against Real Madrid to sink Barcelona's rivals in El Clasico . Blow: Ronaldo (right) would become the second highest-paid player on the planet . Under control? Josep Maria Bartomeu is confident Messi will stay on at Barcelona . On top of the world: Gareth Bale already took Ronaldo's crown as the planet's most expensive player . New man Bartomeu is under pressure to deliver what the supporters want in his first six months in charge and top of that list is tying down Messi, who is currently signed until 2018. The deal, expected to be discussed when Jorge Messi sits down with Bartomeu before the April 16 Copa del Rey final, will add another year to the player’s commitment taking him to 2019 and will take him beyond Cristiano Ronaldo’s estimated €21million (£17.5m) net deal, which works out around £336,000 a week. What remains to be seen is if Barcelona are able to put Messi on a higher wage than Ronaldo while still allowing him 100 per cent of his image rights – a privilege Ronaldo does not enjoy at Real Madrid. Although the figure Ronaldo earns is €1m above Messi, Real Madrid take around 50 per cent of his image rights. History boy: Messi became the first ever Barca player to score a hat-trick at the Bernabeu on Sunday night . Poster boy: But Real Madrid retain around 50 per cent of Ronaldo's image rights . Messi’s badge kissing at the Bernabeu as he became the first Barcelona player ever to score a hat-trick in Real Madrid’s stadium has increased the desire to ensure the superstar stays. All this will further frustrate the clubs who would move if they believed Messi was not planning to stay at the Nou Camp – their only glimmer of hope is that the player is understood to be resisting any moves to increase his buy-out clause currently set at €250m (£208m). Not everyone in Barcelona believes Messi should be given a pay-rise. The editor of Barcelona paper La Vanguardia has said the player should be more grateful to the club. Speaking in a radio debate before the Clasico he said: 'If it was not for the club, Messi would measure 1.40 meters and wouldn’t even reach to hold-on on the metro or the bus. 'He would have fallen on the floor so a bit of gratitude please.' The comment, which was a reference to the growth hormone injections Barcelona paid for Messi to have when he arrived at the club aged 13, have infuriated Barcelona supporters.","Catalan giants set to offer Lionel Messi bumper deal before World Cup .

"By . Pete Jenson . Frustrated Cristiano Ronaldo let rip at Gareth Bale as Real Madrid slumped to their second defeat in four days and slipped behind Barcelona and Atletico Madrid in the La Liga title race . With Real trailing 2-1 in the closing moments at Sevilla, Ronaldo could not hide his frustration after £86million record signing Bale decided to take a free kick, instead of leaving it for the Portuguese forward, and lashed his effort over the bar. Ronaldo was caught by TV cameras aiming a verbal volley at Bale. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Real's Marcelo and Sevilla's Bacca reacting after the match .

Hands on hips: Ronaldo seems to be having a sulk after another damaging defeat for Real . It capped a dismal night for the . Welshman, who was off the pitch changing his boots, leaving Real . temporarily down to 10 men, as Carlos Bacca scored the winner in the 73rd . minute. Madrid's loss at the . Sanchez Pizjuan Stadium came four days after they squandered a chance to . effectively end Barcelona's title defence, with Lionel Messi out-duelling .

These consecutive losses came after Carlo Ancelotti's side had gone undefeated for 31 straight matches. 'We have to keep working, fighting and ask our fans for forgiveness,' said Madrid full back Marcelo. 'It's . tough to do what we did, to keep winning for so many games. We have . lost two games.

"By . Chris Wheeler . and Jack Gaughan . Will Moyes survive until the end of the season? Manchester United great Paul Scholes has delivered a grim assessment of his old club – and singled out £27.5million flop Marouane Fellaini for criticism. Fellaini was outclassed by David Silva, Fernandinho and Yaya Toure at Old Trafford on Tuesday night as United slumped to a humiliating 3-0 defeat in the Manchester derby in front of their own fans. The Belgian, whose only goal this season was for Everton against Stevenage in the Capital One Cup, was also lucky to escape a red card when referee Michael Oliver only booked him for blatantly thrusting a forearm into the face of Manchester City defender Pablo Zabaleta. VIDEO Scroll down to watch David Moyes talk about Manchester United's difficult season . Awful! Paul Scholes rounded on Marouane Fellaini after his display against Manchester City on Tuesday . Red card? The midfielder was lucky to escape severe punishment for this elbow on Pablo Zabaleta . The new Gary Neville? Scholes was in superb form as a pundit for Sky Sports at Old Trafford for the derby . Backing: Scholes, sat alongside Graeme Souness, claimed David Moyes deserves more time as manager . ‘He’s not been great, has he?’ said Scholes, one of the greatest midfielders of his generation. ‘You have to admit that. For a central midfielder at Manchester United for £27m, I’m expecting a few goals at least. ‘He did have problems with his wrist and I know he missed a lot of games but, for the money they paid for him, I’d be expecting a lot more, to be honest with you.' Asked if Fellaini should have been sent off, Scholes replied: 'Yes, without a shadow of a doubt. It's a proper bang into his jaw. How do you get away with that? I've no idea. The referee's stood five yards away.' Scholes was appearing as a Sky pundit for Tuesday’s game and agreed with his former Old Trafford team-mate Gary Neville that United are suffering from a lack of pace. Both seemed surprised that Fellaini was preferred to veteran Ryan Giggs, who gave a virtuoso performance against Olympiacos in the Champions League last week. Bad decision: Former United midfielder Scholes couldn't understand why Ryan Giggs wasn't selected . Difficult night: Wayne Rooney suffered from a lack of service as United struggled to get hold of the game . ‘Whenever we played we always had quick players playing with us,’ added Scholes. ‘Tonight there was Welbeck and Rooney who ran in behind a couple of times but didn’t get seen. ‘That’s when you need players like Ryan Giggs. He is the one who will pass the ball forward. He doesn’t care if he gives it away three or four times, he’ll still risk it. To be a Man United midfielder you need risk in your game. ‘It looks to me that there are a few areas that need addressing. Centre midfield, you could say they’ve been looking for quite a few years now and haven’t quite come up with the answer. ‘Going forward we’re alright. The quality of Van Persie and Rooney, Mata in his right position, I think we’re all right up there. It’s more midfield and defence where we need to look. ‘Defensively, Vidic is going and it looks like Rio and Evra could be going as well. That’s three of your back four gone. That’s another area he’s got to look after.’ Damning: Rio Ferdinand came in for criticism but United are bound to miss him if he is to leave the club . On his way: Central defender Nemanja Vidic is to sign for Italian giants Inter Milan at the end of the season . Scholes believes that United should stand by David Moyes as pressure begins to mount on the beleaguered boss again in the wake of another embarrassing home defeat. And he hinted that the club had let their new manager down last summer by not offering him greater support to add to the signing of Fellaini before Juan Mata arrived in January. ‘He’s nine months into the job and you have to stand by him,’ said Scholes. ‘He’s made a couple of signings that haven’t worked out yet as he would have liked. In the summer he’s going to need backing, there’s no doubt about that. ‘Was he backed as well as he could have been last summer? I’m not too sure. But this summer he has to be backed and I think he knows he needs players.' He does, however, indicate that the manager is making mistakes - particularly with Mata. 'He is a classic No 10,' said Scholes. 'Has he got to play in that position yet?' before adding his surprise at Antonio Valencia being overlooked for the game. 'I'm amazed that Valencia isn't playing,' he mused at half time. 'I would have loved to see him have a right go down that right hand side.' Don't sack him! Despite a horror run of results, Scholes believes United have to stick with Moyes . The former England midfielder, who made 718 appearances in a glittering career at United, admitted that it was hard to watch City demonstrate the gulf in class between the two clubs as they won at Old Trafford for the third time in a row. ‘City were far better than us,’ said Scholes. ‘You could tell which team were going for the league and which team were in seventh, it was that glaringly obvious. ‘City have got the best team, the best players, they play the best football, they’ve got goals everywhere. ‘In the first 10 minutes you thought maybe it could have been three or four. It could have been anything. 'Tonight I never believed we were going . to get back into the game - even at 1-0. I was never really confident we . were going to create chances and score goals. ‘In the second half we never got . going. We huffed and puffed without creating clear-cut chances. That was . always the way for us. We might have been two or three down but we . never felt we were beaten. Tonight I never really felt we were going to . get back into the game even at 1-0. ‘Tonight’s been difficult but I’m sure we’ll have our day again.’ Wizard: David Silva was a standout performer for City as he kept things ticking for Manuel Pellegrini's side . Looking ahead: Scholes doubts whether Manuel Pellegrini's side can win the Premier League title . Silva was electric for Manuel Pellegrini's side during the thumping win, and Scholes was understandably impressed: 'You have to be impressed with what he does. His touch… it’s almost glued to his left foot. Then he does the same with his right foot. Either foot he’ll take it and he can play a pass. 'He has a little bit of pace about him as well. He can manoeuvre the ball well, play people in and has a goal in him. The first 10 minutes he was unplayable.' But the 39-year-old was damning in his assessment of the first two goals. 'Does Fellaini stay with Silva?' he asked. 'No. I'm not sure what Phil Jones has seen there, he's created a big gap.' When dissecting the second, scored by Dzeko from a corner, Scholes added: 'The warning signs were there - it had happened three or four times. (Vincent) Kompany got in before. Rio Ferdinand won't be happy. Rio has stood off him there. You've got to stay tighter.'","Paul Scholes says Marouane Fellaini 'has not been great' for United .

"By . Jeff Powell . George Groves is threatening to pull out of the biggest fight in this country’s boxing history if any British officials are appointed for his re-match with Carl Froch. That ultimatum ignited the first war of words between these two sworn enemies, even as the first tranche of 60,000 Wembley tickets sold out within an hour of going online. That verbal exchange was followed by a shoving match as the pair posed for photographs at the Stadium, with Froch pushing Groves in the chest. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch the press conference . No love lost: Carl Froch and George Groves pose for the cameras on the side of the Wembley pitch . Look into my eyes: Froch refuses to make eye contact with Groves . Up close: Froch pushes Groves on the side of the Wembley pitch . Getting physical: Froch shoves Groves away during the pitch side photo call . Push off: Froch shoves Groves during the stare down . Stand off: Froch and Groves argue as tempers flare up . Step away: Froch and Groves are separated after a minor altercation . And the fight is still two months away. Froch took patriotic exception to Groves demanding that the referee and all three judges on May 31 are foreigners. The financial stakes are astonishingly high. What is now certain to become the first 80,000 boxing crowd on home soil will, alone, generate £6million. Sky are projecting one million pay-per-view buys, potentially worth £17m. Even if the TV audience falls short of that prediction, broadcasting rights in the US and another 100 countries world-wide will ensure that Froch-Groves II breaks the £20m barrier. Then, as promoter Eddie Hearn was able to joke as 1,000 internet ticket sales per minute justified his gamble of committing to Wembley even though England play a pre-World Cup match at the Stadium the night before: ‘We also have the ice cream sales.’ What the world is waiting for: Froch and Groves pose infront of the cameras after their press conference . [caption . Yet Groves insists he is prepared to . walk away from his first seven-figure pay night - Froch as champion gets . the lion’s share of at least £5m - if his demands are not met. He says: ‘One British official, no ring walk. Unless the ref and the judges are from abroad the fight won’t happen.’ Groves . has inserted a clause to that effect into his contract but Froch . counters: ‘This is a huge British fight and it makes a mockery of our . Board of Control to ask them to sanction the fight but not invite them . to the party. It’s insulting.’ The . first clash  ended in that controversy of a premature ninth round . stoppage by top British referee Howard Foster in favour of Froch, even . though Groves was ahead on the scorecards after inflicting a shock . round-one knock down. Groves argues now: ‘Given the long, . heated build up for this second fight I want neutral officials who don’t . live here so won’t be affected, either consciously or subconsciously, . by all the hype on TV and in the press.’ Mind games: Groves plays with a Rubik's Cube while Froch speaks to the press . Matchmaker: Promoter Eddie Hearn poses with both boxers . Says . Froch: ‘George is just worried about a backlash from British judges . after the way he has hung Howard Foster out to dry following the first . fight. But it’s not right. I have complete respect for the British . Boxing Board of Control and we have some of the finest, most . knowledgeable referees and judges in the world. Although the stoppage . was early Howard made an honest decision to protect George when I had . him in trouble. In America, the referees tend to let fighters keep . taking so much punishment that it becomes up to the corners to throw in . the towel.’ The IBF, . whose world super-middleweight title is the principle championship on . the line, have been asked provisionally by the British Board to include . at least one British judge. At . a meeting last week, Hearn asked if they would settle for the . appointment of a British supervisor, probably Board general secretary . Robert Smith who is on the roster of IBF officials. Hearn . adds: ‘It’s  situation we have to resolve in the coming weeks, as . George does have this condition in his contract. But I can’t believe he . would pull out of a fight of the magnitude even if the Board took . absolute exception.’ Record breakers: Tickets for Froch-Groves II sold out in an hour . Not playing the game: Froch refuses to look Groves in the eye after their press conference . Froch doubts it, too. Although Groves . may be less willing to compromise after Froch levered him away with two . hands to the chest at this, their first head-to-head meeting since their . November collision in November – after Carl’s brother Lee loudly . challenged him to an impromptu scrap. The latter incident took place during the media launch of the event, at Wembley, and of itself was laughed off by Groves. The . confrontation between the two boxers themselves came after Froch had . refused to engage with Groves in the traditional stare-down for . publicity pictures and then declined the proffered handshake, although . he did say: ‘Thank you, George.’ Both men had presented themselves initially as more calm, composed and respectful than in the build-up to their first fight. Then . came the difference of opinion about the officials, as well as barbs . about Groves having played with a Rubik cube while Froch was addressing . the TV cameras. Groves jibed: ‘Carl is such a simple puzzle to solve. I wanted a harder one.’ Froch reacted: ‘I bet he didn’t work it out. He’s thick. In one email he spelled pretence as pretense.’ Know your enemy: Groves talks to one of Froch's entourage . Each denied hating the other, although the animosity clearly lingers on. Groves said he would not want to spend time in . room with his rival unless he had to. Froch waved hand under his . challenger’s nose by way of repeating his familiar claim that Groves has . bad breath. So while the physical brush was more handbags than harmful, it was not a publicity stunt.Not that this event needs one. As . those 60,000 tickets flew out over the ether, Hearn was seeking talks . with the London Transport Authority to gain their approval for the sale . of another 20,000 seats. He . may have to agree to bring the timing of the first bell forward, to the . irritation of some overseas broadcasters, in the interests of safety as . the crowd go home at night. If . so, it would be a small price to pay for breaking the live gate record . of 70,000 set by Jack Peterson and Jack Doyle back in the mists of time. The . highest attendances claimed by Wembley are some 50,000 each for Henry . Cooper versus Cassius Clay and Frank Bruno versus Tim Witherspoon. The . biggest turn out hitherto this century is 56,000 for Ricky Hatton’s . fight with Juan Lazcano at his beloved Manchester City’s ground in 2008 – . and that record has gone already. Fingers crossed: Groves is hoping for a different outcome in the re-match . All smiles: Froch looks relaxed at the press conference . On one point the two boxers did agree. Both are hugely excited by being at the centre of such a momentous occasion. Groves said: ‘Everything happens for a reason, even that stonewall robbery in Manchester which has made this happen. I’m doubly thrilled because its in my home city. That’s  one round to me.’ Froch said: ‘This is the national stadium, not anyone’s local football ground. I feel humbled to be part of this. I’m going to enjoy this, and so should everyone else.’ Of course, each thinks he will win. Groves said: ‘Carl has been forced into taking a fight he didn’t want and after how badly I hurt him first time he knows he can’t win. If I decide to go for him early this will be like the old Leonard-Hearns classic, all over in three fantastic rounds.’ Froch said: ‘I had a bad night at the office in Manchester while George was the best he can ever be – but I still won. There will be no arguments after I knock him out here.’ The hype goes on.","Tickets sell out in just one hour, talks taking place to sell a further 20,000 .

"By . Sir Clive Woodward . There will be plenty of pats on the back for England after a convincing Six Nations campaign but now is actually the time to be very tough with each other. Stuart Lancaster’s team have taken huge strides forward over the past six weeks, both in the ambition of their attacking game and in the quality and skill of their execution. They, and especially Lancaster, deserve huge credit for their continued progress towards next year’s World Cup. But the brutal truth that they must all take on board is that England have finished second in the table for a third year running and it is not going to get any easier. Work to do: Stuart Lancaster and England have taken huge strides in this Six Nations, but they still only managed a second placed finish . Champions: Ireland capped Brian O'Driscoll's final championship with a memorable victory . At the weekend, with the trophy to play for, England were playing the poorest team of the tournament who were out on their feet. By half-time Italy were on the ropes but England lacked the killer instinct  to finish them off. This is now the next vital step in the development of this very talented team. There comes a point when the focus must move away from selection to how we are playing the game — and the coaches and players need to look at how to play the last quarter of matches. You need your best 15 players on the field during the most crucial period, but  England lost the Six Nations because of the way they handled the last five minutes against France and the final 15 against Italy. They could easily have scored three tries in the final 10 minutes against Italy. I still fear England are losing so much by changing key players in key moments and the substitution policy is the one area in which I really disagree with the coaching team. The fact remains England never have their best team on the pitch when the final whistle blows. Hauled off: Luther Burrell was substituted after just 53 minutes . Chance: England could have scored three tries in the final 10 minutes - but their strongest line-up was not on the field . I was stunned to see Luther Burrell brought off after 53 minutes. He was one of the outstanding players in the first half. He stays on his feet longer than Manu Tuilagi in contact and sucks in defenders before looking to offload. He was pumped up, playing out of his skin and he had earned the right to exploit those gaps against a tiring team. Players learn crucial things during a game and confidence grows, especially when they are so dominant. The defensive and attacking habits of your opposite man become clear during the heat of battle. Substitutes will add something individually but in terms of the collective you lose much of what you have been building. I would have just loved to see the starting 15 finish the match. If the only changes had been for injury, what would the score have been on Saturday? This game was all about winning the tournament, not about developing your squad. Pumped up: Burrell had an excellent first half . Total: England scored 52 points but it wasn't enough . Be under no illusions, New Zealand this summer is a huge step up. The RBS 6 Nations is a fantastic tournament, but the standard of rugby will not have the Southern Hemisphere teams quaking just yet —and certainly not the All Blacks. New Zealand still play the game a yard quicker — from the basic speed of passing in moving the ball away from contact to the speed of the back row getting over the ball at the breakdown. A lot of England’s players will have never played in New Zealand before and if you get caught in the headlights it can get very ugly very quickly. This is where England’s attitude is crucial and the likes of Owen Farrell, Mike Brown and Dylan Hartley are priceless. If you do not have a bit of that edge when you get off the plane down there it is guaranteed you will get smashed. Lancaster has a get-out-of-jail-free card with his first fixture because he is without players involved in the Premiership final but in their final two Tests England have an opportunity to make a real statement. England’s fitness still concerns me and we are some way short from the overall fitness of England’s players at the turn of the  millennium. When was the last time Hartley played 80 minutes? Individually, every player has to utterly commit to England with the ambition to ensure we arrive at the World Cup as the fittest and most powerful team in history. That must be worked on by players every day behind the scenes. Lying in wait: England face Dan Carter and the mighty New Zealand this summer . Needed: England need Ben Youngs to come back to his best and pressure Danny Care . That should also inspire players on the cusp of the squad or fighting to get back in. Somewhere back in Leicester, Ben Youngs will be seething, but England need him to get back to his best to pressure Danny Care. First-choice players need to  be under constant pressure to keep their place. This has been a  fantastic tournament for Care and Farrell. But you need pressure in all positions. France were one forward pass from handing the title to England and that trophy can transform the stature of a team. I was in a packed hotel bar in Rome on Saturday and English fans were screaming for France. I never thought I’d see that and I must confess to not being one of those! What would have happened if England had kicked off third on Saturday with an exact target to go for? Would the substitutions or the tactics have been different? Would they have played with more urgency in the last quarter? Would the mindset have changed? If the answer is yes, then that explains the next stage of the team’s development. A winning mentality is about being ruthless in achieving your targets. Congratulations to Ireland, I did not think they quite had the firepower to go to Paris and beat a desperate France, but what a  wonderfully deserving send-off for Brian O’Driscoll. In his final 12 months as a professional player he has won a Lions series and a Six Nations trophy. Wales have been a shadow of the team they were before the Lions tour but they will bounce back. They still have very good players and coaches and everyone in Wales needs to regroup behind Warren Gatland and Sam Warburton. Regroup: Wales are a shadow of their former selves and need to regroup behind Sam Warburton and Warren Gatland . Triple Crown — I didn’t even realise there was a trophy. It’s a nonsense. Tired legs — If a team or individual has tired legs, or needs ‘fresh legs’, they should not have started. Ball Carrier — Everyone carries a ball. A phrase created for unimaginative players who just smash into people.","Stuart Lancaster's men were good but England lacked the killer instinct to get the job done .

"By . Derek Lawrenson . Tiger Woods . admitted for the first time on Wednesday he was worried about his long-term . future. Rory McIlroy came up with a risque joke about England’s football team . that will no doubt leave a few over-sensitive souls feeling outraged. Some preview days are nothing more than . routine but that was certainly far from the case at the WGC-Cadillac . Championship. Let’s start with Woods and an interview . that was among the more revealing of his usually secretive career. On Sunday at . the Honda Classic he walked off the course with just five holes to complete . with a recurring back complaint. Stony faced: Tiger Woods in practice on Wednesday ahead of the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral . Sandman: Woods plays from a bunker ahead of his return to competitive action on Thursday . Concern: The world No 1 is suffering with a recurring back injury with just a month to go until the Masters . The world No 1 and this . week’s defending champion is planning to play in the first round but will . do so having hit nothing but the odd chip and putt at the totally revamped . Doral. Woods first started experiencing . spasms in his lower back last September. Back then he was curt when asked . whether there were any long-term implications but here he was more forthcoming. ‘A bad back is something that is no joke,’ said Woods. ‘When I’ve had my . injuries over the years, it always hurt after impact. So it’s fine, the ball . has gone, it’s going to hurt like hell but I can do my job. ‘But with the back it’s a totally different . deal, and that’s one of the things I’ve learned about this type of injury. On . Sunday I couldn’t twist and so couldn’t make a backswing and when it’s like . that there’s nothing you can do. So we’re going to have a proper look at it and . try to come up with something preventative but it’s a fact I don’t heal like I . used to do. I watch my kids bounce right back up after they fall down and I . think: ”Hey, I used to do that.”’ Woods came up with a nice line about meeting up . with his watching daughter Sam by the 13th green. ‘That was a very . interesting concept trying to explain to a six-year-old why you’ve just quit,’ he said. In the swing: Rory McIlroy hits a shot during a practice round prior to the Cadillac Championship . Ostentatious: Donald Trump  stands in front of the Tiger Woods Villa - where McIlroy is staying this week . Bouncing back: McIlroy blew a chance to win at the Honda Classic with a poor back nine last Sunday . Tiger wasn’t the only one with problems during . that amazing final round, of course. McIlroy threw away the event with a poor . back nine but you’d never have guessed from his ebullient mood. As for that line about England, he . was asked whether he had ever employed a psychologist in light of England using . one. After answering the question, a broad smile spread across his . face. ’I think It’s more than a psychologist that England need,’ he said. In Australia in December last year, McIlroy got . in a bit of bother with the internet trolls for replying, when asked whom he . would be supporting in the forthcoming Ashes Test series: ’Anyone but England.’ Perhaps anticipating the Twitter reaction on this occasion, . he added: ’Please don’t print that.’ A bit late for that given the interview was . broadcast live but it’s worth repeating: it was a joke, people. Luke-ing good: England's former world No 1 Donald hits an iron during a practice session . Familiar face: Open champion Phil Mickelson is also teeing it up again this week in Florida . Chip: Henrik Stenson of Sweden hones his short game in front of a lake showing off a Cadillac . It wasn’t his only good one, either. Some . of the $250million Donald Trump has spent on rebuilding this place has gone on . naming the refurbished blocks of villas after legends of the game. Wouldn’t you . know it, McIlroy is staying in the…Tiger Woods villa. ‘There’s pictures all over my room of him,’ said . McIlroy, laughing. ‘I sent him a message last night saying: “I can’t get away . from you. I can’t go to the bathroom without looking at you.”’ Travelling in style: Donald Trump's helicopter was at Doral ahead of the WGC-Cadillac Championship . Meet and greet: Woods and Trump shake hands on the eve of the WGC-Cadillac Champonship . Make yourself at home: (from left) Eric Trump, Donald Trump, Tiger Woods, Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr at the presentation of the key to the Tiger Woods Villa - where McIlroy will be staying this week . McIlroy admitted he was disappointed with . the way he played down the stretch on Sunday. ‘I wasn’t as committed to my . shots as I should have been but there were a lot of positives to take out of . the week,’ he insisted. ‘It was my third strokeplay tournament of the year and . the third time I have been in contention so if you keep doing that you’re going . to eventually walk through the door and win, and then when you get into the . habit of it, everything becomes a bit easier.’ Amidst the flurry of mistakes McIlroy made . coming home there was one truly outstanding blow on the 18th. When . nothing else would do, he produced a stunning 240 yard five wood shot on that . dangerous par-five that finished just 10 feet from the flag. ‘That might be the . best shot I have ever played under pressure,’ he said. It earned him a spot in . the four man play-off but he couldn’t capitalize, with American Russell Henley . snatching first prize. Woods’s participation means the world’s top 50 . are all present here among this elite field of 69 players. With a first prize of . a shade under £1million, any European victory will clearly have a huge bearing . on the race for places at the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles in September.","Tiger Woods gives revealing interview about his back injury .

"By . Matthew Hall . Oops! They did it again. Michael Jordan has been sued by yet another woman claiming basketball's greatest-ever player is the father of her baby. According to TMZ.com, the former Chicago Bulls star is being sued by a Georgia woman who claims Jordan fathered her daughter, born in 2010. The suit comes just months after a similar case against the basketball legend was tossed out of a Georgia court. Laquetta Theus, pictured here in a photograph from her Facebook profile, claims Michael Jordan is the father of her two-year-old child . Jordan, now 50, is reported to claim the suit is another case of a desperate woman seeking to leech cash from him. Acclaimed by the NBA and most fans as the greatest basketball player of all time, Jordan still holds huge earning power and is estimated to make a giant-sized $80 million per year even after quitting the game. The most-recent suit, filed by Laquetta Theus, alleges she gave birth to Juyana Rachelle Henderson in August 2010. Theus is claiming child support from Jordan. More...

You drop 10 million on your nice wedding ... that was nice but don’t you think it time that you support your daughter?' Jordan with wife Yvette Prieto in Las Vegas before their April wedding. The ex-basketballer is involved in his second paternity suit in 12 months . Jordan beat a similar suit earlier this year filed by another alleged 'baby momma'. Pamela Smith, who now runs a website selling her skills as a 'loveologist', claimed Jordan fathered her 17-year-old son and demanded cash from the icon. Smith's Twitter account, using the name 'Evette Smith', claims she is 'America's hottest love expert'. Pamela Smith unsuccessfully sued Jordan for paternity and is now a self-proclaimed 'love and sex expert' Jordan denied Smith's charge and his attorneys demanded a DNA test from Smith. Like Theus, the self-proclaimed love-and-sex expert lives in Georgia. At the time of the case, the ex-Bull called Smith's allegations 'a shameless, bad faith attempt to abuse the legal system.' The case was dropped after it was discovered public records showed the identity of the father of Smith's son had been confirmed in 2003. The paternity of the teen was . 'conclusively established' in divorce filings between Smith and her . ex-husband, Jordan’s attorney told the court at the time. The judge ordered Smith to pay $9,704 in costs to cover Jordan's legal bills. Reflecting the Smith case, Jordan has again filed a counter claim against Theus stating little baby Juyana is not his. Last April, Jordan married long-time girlfriend Yvette Prieto, a 34-year-old Cuban-American model, in a flamboyant ceremony in Palm Beach, Florida. The wedding is estimated to have cost $10 million with a 300-person star-packed guest list that included golfer Tiger Woods, Jordan's former teammate Scottie Pippen, and movie director Spike Lee. Music megastars Usher and Robin Thicke performed on the big night. Jordan, one of the most recognizable athletes in the world, won six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls and was named by Associated Press only second to baseballer Babe Ruth in their list of the greatest athletes of the 20th century. Jordan retired from professional basketball in 2003.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Ordering a hamburger when you’re trying to impress a date can lead to disaster. One bite and lashings of gherkins, sauce and salad will find themselves all over your face, hands and clothes. But now scientists have come up with the perfect way to hold a burger that could avoid this awkward scenario. Instead of the traditional method of holding a burger using thumbs on the bottom and fingers on the top, scientists claim you should use both thumbs and pinkies to hold the bottom of the burger (right) and the three middle fingers to hold it from the top (left) After four intensive months of research, scientists believe they have finally found the solution to holding a hamburger without causing a spillage. The secret is all in using the pinkie. Instead of the traditional method of holding a burger using thumbs on the bottom and fingers on the top, scientists claim you should use both thumbs and pinkies to hold the bottom of the burger. The remaining three middle fingers should be used to hold the top of the bun in place. This divides the burger into equal parts meaning that it can be held uniformly. Three researchers – experts in mechanics, engineering, and dentistry – spent four months coming up with the perfect solution. The study was organised by Japanese television show 'Honma Dekka!?' and involved a 3D scan of a burger to try and understand how the different elements worked together. Most people hold a burger using their thumbs on the bottom and fingers on the top. But the Japanese data revealed that this technique is completely wrong. Instead they found that using thumbs and the little fingers to hold the bottom, while using the middle three fingers on each hand to hold the top, would avoid spillages. This divides the burger into equal parts meaning that it can be held uniformly, according to a report in Kotaku. The scientist warned against holding on too tightly in case the bun is crushed and the contents spills out the back. Also, the dental expert suggested warming up the muscles in your mouth before eating a big hamburger by opening and closing it a few times. Something to try, perhaps, next time you’re attempting to impress your lunch companion.

"By . Jeff Powell . The first batch of 60,000 tickets for Froch v Groves II sold out inside an hour of going on sale and Wembley is heading for the biggest crowd in British boxing history. Promoter Eddie Hearn is seeking talks with Transport for London for approval to market a further 20,000 seats before the world super middleweight fight takes place on May 31.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A key element to attending any football game is getting to the stadium hours in advance to grill food and drink beer in the parking lot. But anyone attending the Super Bowl in New Jersey next year will have to go without the traditional, pre-game festivities - the Super Bowl Committee announced today that there will be no tailgating allowed at this year's big game. 'You will be allowed to have food in your car and have drink in your . car,' committee Chairman Al Kelly said at a news conference on Monday. 'And provided you're in the boundaries of a single . parking space, you'll be able to eat or drink right next to your car. However, you're not going to be able to take out a lounge chair, you're . not going to be able to take out a grill, and you're not going to be . able to take up more than one parking space. And it'll all be watched . very carefully.' No tailgating for you: The Super Bowl Committee has banned tailgating at next year's Super Bowl in New Jersey . But the tailgating buzzkill isn't the only rule the committee is imposing for the Super Bowl - how fans get to the February 2 game also will be regulated. The game is expected to draw an estimated 80,000 people. But the stadium will only allow about 13,000 individual parking spaces. The solution: the committee will charter buses to shuttle fans from nine locations throughout the region to the stadium - at $51 per person. And that's after fans have, in many cases, already shelled out thousands of dollars to attend the game. No parking: In addition to tailgating restrictions, the stadium will only offer 13,000 parking spots for an estimated 80,000 fans . And don't think about taking a cab or car service to the game - no vehicles will be allowed near the stadium on game day without a parking pass. 'Nobody's going to be dropped off by black car,' Kelly said. 'You can . have a black car, a green car, a white car, a red car as long as you . have parking, and the car needs to stay on the premises the entire . time.' So maybe you'll just park further from the stadium and walk, right? Wrong. 'You cannot walk to the Super Bowl,' Kelly said. 'You can get your hotel to drop you off at one of the New Jersey Transit locations or get the shuttle to take you to a Fan Express location, but you cannot walk.' Kelly said he expects about 75 percent of ticket holders will use public transportation to get to the game, and that the reduced parking capacity is the result of a larger security perimeter needed around the stadium for a game as high-profile as the Super Bowl. Super Bowl committee Chairman Al Kelly and other organizers have dubbed this year's game the 'public transportation Super Bowl' Hosting the Super Bowl in the New York City area is a rare occurrence and has required a lot of logistical planning by city, state and league officials regarding both transportation and security. It has been dubbed by organizers as 'the public transportation Super Bowl.' James Simpson, the commissioner of the New Jersey Department of . Transportation, said 'the department will suspend all construction before . the week of the game and planned to staff Super Bowl media day and game . day at the same level it does for a weather emergency' with the goal of keeping traffic on highways and bridges moving smoothly. A February blizzard - which isn't uncommon in the northeast - could potentially throw that plan off the rails. But it would make for an exciting game.","The Super Bowl committee also has set restrictions on how people get to the game .

"By . Jill Reilly . A Pakistani mother who gave birth to sextuplets last week is devastated after being told that two of her babies have died from infections. The woman gave birth to four girls and two boys at the hospital in the Bannu district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Doctors said the sextuplets and their mother, who has not been named, were healthy and in a stable condition after their birth on Friday. A Pakistani mother who gave birth to sextuplets last week is devastated after being told that two of her babies have died from infections . The woman gave birth to four girls and two boys at the hospital in the Bannu district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa . But today Abdur Rahman Wazir, the father of the infants, confirmed two girls had died due to a severe infection. Wazir told a local Pakistani newspaper: 'We had decided to celebrate the birth of six children but God took two of our babies from us.' The name of the mother has not been revealed owing to strict local customs, which restrict naming of females in public. Today Abdur Rahman Wazir, the father of the infants, confirmed two girls had died due to a severe infection . But Wazir, who is a tribesman from Datta Khel in Pakistan's volatile North Waziristan province, said the other four babies are 'doing fine'. The odds of having sextuplets are extremely low, with one occurring in every 4.5 million pregnancies. But many end in miscarriages and, even if the babies defy the odds, the mortality rate is high. In more than 90 per cent of sextuplet births, one or more will die before their first birthday. Wazir's wife had given birth to six babies, two boys and four girls at a private clinic in Bannu city. She had attended a clinic for a routine check-up, but later went into labour. The infants were then shifted to the Combined Military Hospital, where they were found to be underweight and subsequently put on incubators. However, doctors at the military hospital said the mother was healthy and in a stable condition. 'We are devastated by the fact that two infants could not make it. The other four babies are doing very well,' a gynaecologist told local reporters. 'We are still monitoring their condition. The mother is also recuperating very well. But she is in shock for having lost two babies.'

"By . Richard Marsden . Heather Mills has abandoned her attempt to qualify for the British  Paralympic skiing team following a row over her boot. Sir Paul McCartney’s former wife – who had her left leg amputated below the knee in 1993 after a road accident – was told she must wear a cover over her boot and prosthetic leg to comply with international rules. The 45-year-old had argued that it would result in ‘unnecessary weight’ and cause ‘intolerable pain’. Heather Mills with her silver World Cup medal earlier this year. She has abandoned her attempt to join the British paralympic team after being told the boot for her prosthetic leg does not meet regulations . She had hoped to compete at the games in Sochi, Russia, in March after winning a World Cup silver medal earlier this year. But . Sylvana Mestre, of the International Paralympic Committee, said the . former model would be disqualified if she did not comply with the . ruling. Miss Mills’ spokesman said: ‘We cannot believe she was told she . would be disqualified for not wearing cosmetic, non-functional buckles . on her ski boot. ‘We feel . very saddened that all her hard work, injury, struggles and the . overcoming of them, has come to her having to resign because of a . bureaucratic decision that would lead to further pain and injury. Mrs Mills, 45, was told she must wear a cover over her boot and prosthetic leg to meet international regulations - despite arguing it would result in 'unnecessary weight' and cause 'intolerable pain' ‘Although . her dreams and hopes for Sochi are now over, Heather hopes to one day . compete in winter sports when the IPC re-evaluates the unfair systems it . has in place.’ Despite . Mills’ World Cup skiing success, she struggled through her . qualification for the Paralympics – with problems including being . ‘ejected’ from her prosthetic leg when practising slalom. In the . summer, she had a new leg and boot design created by London Prosthetics . Centre to help reduce the problem. Mills’ management said that wearing the boot cover, which locks to her left . leg below the knee, causes a large amount of friction, painful . inflammation and blisters.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The U.S. government is tapping communications from all around the world using international undersea cables, it has been revealed. In another top-secret National Security Agency slide exposing the even wider reach of the government's intelligence programs, a crude map shows the extensive cable network that carries a huge amount of the world's voice and internet traffic from either side of North America and onto the rest of the globe. At the top of the slide in large letters the word 'Upstream' is written, with the description: 'Collection of communications on fiber cables and infrastructure as data flows past' and the code names Fairview, Stormbrew, Blarney and Oakstar. New slide: Another top-secret National Security Agency slide, pictured, obtained by The Washington Post, has exposed the government's surveillance of underwater cables . Underneath, 'PRISM' is written, showing the eavesdropping on cables runs in parallel with the spying on technology giants such as Google and Yahoo that was blown open by whistleblower Edward Snowden. An arrow on the left points to each with the caption, telling NSA staffers: 'You Should Use both.' The overall heading of the slide, published for the first time today by The Washington Post, is 'FAA 702 Operations,' which refers to a 2008 law that allowed collection on U.S. soil for foreign intelligence purposes of communications of foreigners thought to be overseas without the need to get a warrant from a court. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence told The Sunday Post that legally authorized data collection 'has been one of our most important tools for the protection of the nation's - and our allies' - security. Our use of these authorities has been properly classified to maximize the potential for effective collection against foreign terrorists and other adversaries.' Whistleblower: The tapping of cables extends from what NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden already made public about the use of PRISM . It added that the intelligence and law enforcement communities would continue to work will all members of Congress to ensure a proper balance is struck between privacy and protection for citizens. It is not known how many American's emails or phone calls have been monitored because they are communicating with a potential foreign target. The world's hundreds of undersea cables, many of which lie across the ocean floor, now carry 99 per cent of all intercontinental data including most international phone calls, The Post reports.","Another top-secret National Security Agency slide, published by The Washington Post, exposes the even wider reach of the government's intelligence programs .

"By . Wil Longbottom . UPDATED: . 18:03 EST, 16 February 2012 . Gruelling: Christopher Carlson, 45, is alleged to have hit, kicked and choked his three grandsons during long hikes in the Grand Canyon as temperatures soared to 108F . The eldest grandson of a man accused of child abuse testified today that he secretly asked another hiker to call 911 during a long, hot hike in the Grand Canyon last year. The boy said his vision and hearing became altered and mountains appeared to sway during the 19-mile hike on August 28, a day that saw temperatures soar to 108F. He also claimed he fell down several times because of cramping. Prosecutors alleged that Christopher Alan . Carlson, 45, subjected his three grandsons to a gruelling ordeal, choking . them and repeatedly beating them during hikes. The child told the Phoenix court: 'I needed medical attention and I was hurting and he was hitting and pushing me and calling me fat. 'I was scared and it was hard and I was all weak and tired and kind of hurt.' The child had previously said his grandfather hit him in the face, kicked him and his two brothers and deprived them of food and water during 'hikes from hell' in the Grand Canyon. Under questioning, the boy also said that Carlson, from Indianapolis, would pinch pressure points in their back that 'kinda hurt' during the hikes. The statements from the boy are the first he has made publicly about his grandfather, who faces six counts of felony child abuse. The 45-year-old has pleaded not guilty in the case and could face life in prison. A criminal complaint said Carlson put his grandsons - 12, nine and eight years old at the time - in circumstances 'likely to cause death or serious bodily injuries'. The two younger grandsons testified in federal court yesterday and earlier today. The middle grandson said earlier that Carlson discovered that the boys had hidden cauliflower, asparagus and fish in their van, but made them eat it even though the food had hair and other debris on it. Another time, the boy said Carlson made him eat broccoli that he had tried to flush down the toilet. Rugged: Carlson took his three grandsons on two 19-mile hikes through the Grand Canyon in August last year . However investigators have also said that . Carlson told them the boys were overweight and he thought hiking in the . Grand Canyon would get them into shape. Defense lawyer Jeffrey Williams portrayed Carlson as a health nut who had a firm hand and wanted to show the boys the world. After the long hike the boys were tired, hungry and thirsty, but Carlson only allowed them to eat healthy food like tofu, hummus and veggie burgers, Williams said. 'I suppose to an eight, nine or 12-year-old that might seem like child abuse if you like cheeseburgers, French fries and pizza,' he said. 'He wanted to get them from behind the TV, the games and fast food.' The youngest of the three brother testified that he experienced cramping, nausea and hunger during the miles-long treks. But he also told jurors that his grandfather took the boys on 'awesome' adventurous trips. Harsh: The boys were allegedly deprived of food and water during the exhausting hikes and were suffering from heat exposure when they were spotted by a ranger . Between the two hikes, Carlson took the . boys on a tour of the Hoover Dam, to rides atop the Stratosphere hotel . and a Criss Angel magic show in Las Vegas, as well as Disneyland in . California. He also spoke of trips to Mexico, . Belize, Honduras and across the western U.S. last summer with Carlson . and his two older brothers. The trips often included long hikes, . swimming and fishing in the ocean. Although investigators have said Carlson withheld food and water, the youngest boy testified that he and his brothers were allowed to drink water most of the time and snacked on celery, carrots, tofu and low-carb hummus during the hikes. The criminal complaint said that one brother feared one of his siblings would fall to his death because Carlson forced him to walk on the edge of the trail even though he was cramping and falling down. 'There's nothing life-threatening about a . blister. If these kids were abused they were abused by . kindness and all the fun and trips they took over the summer.' Defence lawyer, Jeffrey Williams . Another brother said that when he fell, Carlson picked him up by the throat and threw him to the ground, and another said Carlson had slammed his face into a rock. Investigators said the boys were covered in cuts, bruises and scars that backed up their stories. But Mr Williams told jurors yesterday the injuries 'are consistent with boys who are just normal boys'. 'There's nothing life-threatening about a blister,' he said. 'If these kids were abused they were abused by kindness and all the fun and trips they took over the summer.' A ranger with binoculars spotted the group during their 19-mile hike on August 28, the same day a man died on another trail from heat exposure. Extreme exercise: Warnings dot the Grand Canyon where Carlson made his grandsons hike for 19-miles in 108F . He reported seeing Carlson shoving the oldest boy and whipping him with a rolled-up t-shirt. Rangers fed the boys and gave them water after one showed symptoms of heat stroke and the other two had signs of heat exhaustion and dehydration. Under questioning from Williams, the boy said his grandfather was in a hurry on the August 28 hike to get to the top of the Grand Canyon so they could watch the sunset together. The prosecution in their opening statement said: 'These hikes became a life or death situation for these children at the hands of the person that was supposed to be protecting them.'","Prosecutors claim Christopher Carlson, 45, choked boys on trip ."

"By . Andrew Levy . More than a third of pupils at independent schools are now getting financial support to continue their studies . Bursaries at independent schools have soared in value by a fifth in three years as hard-up British parents struggle to pay soaring fees. More than a third of pupils at independent schools are now getting financial support to continue their studies. Means-tested awards have gone up by around £50 million since 2010 from £255million in 2010 to £303 million, including an increase of 6.7 per cent since last year. Education experts said the figures, from the Independent Schools Council, showed private schools were having to help even wealthy British parents to afford private education for their children. Instead they are becoming increasingly reliant on wealthy overseas students paying full fees. The numbers of foreign youngsters attending fee-paying schools rose by 1.4 per cent between 2012 and 2013 - around 365 extra children - as the number of British students or those resident in the UK, fell by around 0.4 per cent, down around 1,893 children. Chris McGovern, a former independent school headteacher and chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said even lawyers and bankers were complaining of being unable to meet fees that average £27,612 for boarders and £12,153 for day pupils. ‘The increase in fees has been dramatic in the past 20 years and there is pressure on public schools, particularly those that are away from centres of affluence,’ he said. ‘The system is healthy but it is becoming reliant on the influx of money and pupils from overseas.’ Britain’s 1,223 private schools - which have 508,000 pupils - now hand out £303 million each year in means-tested bursaries, defined by the Good Schools Guide as ‘for helping out the impoverished but deserving and those fallen on hard times’. Over two-fifths of parents who receive financial support have more than half the cost waived. Around one in 100 children are educated for free. A further £174 million is used to reduce fees for eligible pupils, including children of armed forces personnel and clergy. Another £145 million goes on scholarships. The hand-outs means 33.7 per cent of pupils now receive some form of financial support.In 2007, 31.5 per cent of pupils had help with their fees. Despite the awards, the number of pupils slid 0.3 per cent from last year among the 1,204 schools that took part in both censuses. Education experts said the figures, from the Independent Schools Council, showed private schools were having to help even wealthy British parents to afford private education for their children . Fees rose 3.9 per cent last year, according to the ISC annual census - the lowest increase for 20 years but still well above the rate of inflation. Pupil numbers also flatlined over the past 12 months, despite increasing numbers of foreign pupils sent by parents keen for their children to experience a British education. Pupil numbers have now fallen or stagnated in all but one of the last five years. The biggest decline between 2012 and 2013 was among boarders, with a 1.4 per cent drop. Some of the shortfall was made up by a 1.4 per cent increase in non-British pupils, pushing the total to nearly 26,000. More than a third are from the booming economies of China and Hong Kong. The number of Russian pupils has risen by more than a quarter (27.4 per cent) in the past year, while the numbers of Chinese pupils are up 5.4 per cent and Nigerian students up 16.3 per cent. Overall, there are now 25,805 non-British students with parents living overseas at UK fee-paying schools, up from 25,441 in 2012. Almost 30 independent schools now have branches abroad educating 19,000 children. ISC chairman Barnaby Lenon(CORR) said: ‘I am delighted that the numbers at independent schools have held up so well this year, despite the recession.’","Means-tested awards have gone up by around £50 million since 2010 .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Labour grandees were accused of showing contempt for the public last night after they dismissed calls for an EU referendum. Arch-Europhiles, some in the pay of Brussels, rejected calls for a vote as the House of Lords debated plans to enshrine in law David Cameron’s pledge to hold a referendum in 2017. Former European Commissioner Lord Mandelson, who will get a lucrative pension from Brussels at 65, said politicians should not entrust the public with an in-out vote on the EU as the outcome would be a lottery. Lord Mandelson, Labour's former Business Secretary, said Britain¿s EU membership is 'absolutely fundamental' and must not be put 'in the hands' of an unpredictable referendum . Lord Kinnock, whose family is reported to have received £10million in pay, perks and pension entitlements while he and his wife Glenys worked in Brussels, attacked the plans as an appeasement to Eurosceptics. They spoke in a seven-hour Lords debate on a Private Member’s Bill, introduced by Tory MP James Wharton, which sailed through the Commons after Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg declined to block it. But Labour and Liberal Democrat peers . yesterday launched a coordinated assault. The Bill passed its second . reading without a vote – the convention in the Lords – but critics are . now expected to table hundreds of amendments in a bid to derail it. The Bill was introduced into the Lords by . Tory Lord Dobbs, who said: ‘Nobody below the age of 60 has ever had a . chance to have a say on this issue. This Bill is needed and it is very . much wanted. ‘A referendum is about democracy. It is not about being in Europe, it about allowing people to decide their own future. It would be a brave man who denies them that choice – and an even braver unelected peer.’ Lord Dobbs, pictured with Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright, is missing the Golden Globes for the debate . House of Cards creator Lord Dobbs missed the Golden Globes to battle for an EU referendum. The . best-selling author of the acclaimed political thriller is leading . piloting the EU referendum Bill through the House of Lords. The . trilogy House of Cards featured scheming Chief Whip Francis Urquhart . plotting the downfall of his rivals in the Commons to become Prime . Minister. It became a hit . miniseries for the BBC in 1990s and last year was remade by the US with . Kevin Spacey playing central character, House Majority Whip Frank . Underwood. The series won three Emmys and this weekend is nominated for four Golden Globes including best TV series. However, . Lord Dobbs will not be in Beverley Hills for Sunday's ceremony, because . today's EU debate did not give him time to travel. Ahead . of the debate he said: 'I'm about to make the biggest speech of my life . (or at least since the one I made proposing to my wife). 'I . am the sponsor of the EU Referendum Bill that is designed to give . everyone a vote on our membership of the European Union at some point in . 2017. It's hugely important. It's time for the people to decide.' But Lord Mandelson told the BBC: ‘Membership of the EU is absolutely fundamental to British interests and therefore we should be very wary about putting our interests in the hands of a lottery.’ In the Lords, he said Mr Cameron had been ‘taken hostage by the militant tendency’ of the Tory party. When he left Brussels, Lord Mandelson received £234,000 ‘top-up’ salary payments and a £15,000 resettlement fee. Under the terms of his pension he has to continue to show a ‘duty of loyalty to the Communities’. The BBC was accused of ‘unbelievable bias’ over Europe yesterday after a presenter branded a referendum a ‘charade’ and suggested it would be ‘stupid’ to give the public a say. Radio 4 broadcaster Evan Davis was accused of repeatedly interrupting Tory Lord Dobbs on the Today show but let Labour’s Lord Mandelson twice speak for almost two minutes. Mr Davis also predicted a Labour victory in 2015 that made a Bill over the referendum pointless. Downing Street complained, but the BBC last night said it was ‘satisfied’ its coverage was fair and balanced. Peter Bone, Tory MP for Wellingborough, said: ‘Peter Mandelson thinks that the British people can’t be trusted. He believes the European political elites know best.’ Former mandarins and pro-EU politicians condemned the Bill in the Lords. Lord Kinnock said that, when elected Tory leader, Mr Cameron had pleaded with his party to stop ‘banging on’ about Europe. ‘Mr Cameron’s appeal to stop the “banging on” has been greeted daily by the war drums of the unyielding Europhobes inside, and UKIP outside, his party, and to the detriment of our country, he has pranced to their rhythm,’ Lord Kinnock said. But former Labour Foreign Secretary Lord Owen, who now sits as a crossbencher, said that while the Bill was a gimmick it was essential to placate the public. And former Tory Chancellors Lord Lamont and Lord Lawson said Britain’s future did not lie in the EU. The Bill must still go through committee, report and third reading stages in the Lords before returning to the Commons. Because it is a Private Member’s Bill, it  can be heard only during Friday sessions – the last of which in the Commons in this Parliamentary session is February 28 – but senior Tory sources say they will not let  it be killed off. Gosh, the Establishment Europhiles were worried. Cross, too. They had been asked to look at a Tory Bill for a referendum on the European Union. On a Friday! What a blazing affront. Fridays are for doing the crossword at home. Fridays are for martinis before lunch, canasta and filling in one’s parliamentary expenses claims. They certainly aren’t for discussing our possible departure from the greatest gravy boat of all time, the ultimate bateau de jus, le grand paquebot de sauce bearnaise, the European Union. David Cameron has ordered all Conservative MPs to back legislation paving the way for a referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union to take place by the end of 2017 . These pro-Brussels lordships considered the Bill both tyrannous and trifling. It was dangerous but it was also ‘otiose’. Yes. That was the word. ‘Otiose’. A very House of Lords word. Isn’t it a beaut’? It means ‘functionless, futile, superfluous’. So why do they complain about it? If something is truly otiose, it can be ignored. The foot-stamping protestations of a railway passenger left on the platform as the train pulls out of the station are otiose. Yet the Europhiles were not ignoring this Bill. Ooooh no. Queued up, they did, the former Foreign Office grandees, the failed MPs, the onetime MEPs and European Commission officials and quangoland worthies who nowadays fill the increasingly rotten Upper House, to moan like the Greek chorus in an amateur production of Aeschylus. Worried about the hoi polloi? Lord Mandelson was one of those leading the way against a referendum . ‘Otiose,’ said Spanish-flavoured Lord Garel-Jones (Con). ‘Otiose’ said Lord Oakeshott (Lib Dem). Lord Davies of Grantham, the ex-Tory MP who defected to Gordon Brown’s government (was a peerage part of the deal?) used words such as ‘squalid’ and ‘scandalous’. Lord Richard (Lab), once a grand fromage of the European Commission, was a living bifurcation of ennui and vexation, disdain and dismay brought together in the same vinaigrette bottle and given a brisk shaking. It did not help that someone had forgotten to put old Richard on the list of peers to speak. There was apparently much behind-the-scenes harrumphing. Then someone noticed that Lord Bichard’s name had been included by mistake, so maybe one of the clerks misread Richard’s handwriting and put down Bichard instead. The mistake was rectified. Lord Richard, who wasted a quarter of an hour at the start on a silly (I nearly said otiose) procedural point, complained that the House was being asked to rush the Bill. This was a line of argument used by other Europhiles. That absurd and actually unpleasant man Lord Foulkes (Lab WC Fields lookalike) gave a warning that he had cleared all his coming Fridays. This was a coded way of saying that he may try to talk out the Bill. Lord Strathclyde (Con), making his first speech since stepping down as Leader of the House, said it would be a truly bad idea for an unelected House to try to prevent the people of Britain having a vote on Europe. The Europhiles ignored him. Lord Wigley (Plaid Cymru), one of those who promised to subject the Bill to as much scrutiny as he could manage, said ‘I am as passionately pro-European as I am committed to Wales’. Given that Lord Wigley is reputed to sleep in a pair of pyjamas printed with the red dragon, and that his home’s loo chain may well ring ‘Land Of My Fathers’ every time it is yanked, this was quite a declaration. Defence: Lord Strathclyde, pictured, said the people shouldn't be denied a referendum - and was ignored . The Bill was put by its proposer, Lord Dobbs (Con), author of House of Cards. Labour’s Opposition was led by Lord Liddle, whose wife used to be No 3 at the BBC (she left with a stonking payout). Liddle was onetime Brussels bag carrier to Lord Mandelson. Mandy himself spoke, as did Lord Kinnock, another ex-EU Commissioner. What an acidic speech he gave, attacking Eurosceptics as ‘Europhobes’. Did we hear these Brussels pensioners declare their continuing financial interests? We did not. The best speech was from former Foreign Secretary Lord Owen (Crossbencher), who said that a referendum was now the ‘settled will’ of the people. But it is not the settled will of former Foreign Office wallahs such as Lord Hannay, who wanted foreigners in Britain to be given a vote in the referendum. Eh? The drawling, patronising Europhiles intend to fight and fight dirty. They hate the idea of giving hoi polloi their say. They may well block this Bill. But their stubbornness will only help David Cameron delineate positions and will only increase public anger with the EU – and this House of Lords. I started watching the debate uncertain how I might vote in a referendum. The more I listened to these imperious Europhiles, the more I leaned towards the exit.","Labour grandee warns EU membership must not be 'in the hands' of voters .

"By . James  Nye . Tragedy: Rebecca Ann Sedwick suffered terrible online bullying at the hands of a small group of girls even after she left her Florida Elementary School . A 12-year-old Florida girl was found dead on Tuesday morning after apparently jumping to her death from the top of an industrial cement silo because she was bullied remorselessly on social media. Last seen leaving her home on the way to school at 6.45 a.m. on Monday morning, Rebecca Ann Sedwick was discovered dead at an abandoned cement factory in Lakeland early on Tuesday. While police have not officially declared Rebecca's death suicide, her family fear she took her own life after year and a half of constant bullying which caused her to change her name on one of her social media handles to 'That Dead Girl'. Her mother, Tricia Norman told Fox 13 in Florida that she reported her daughter missing at 7 p.m. on Monday evening when she failed to return from school. She added that other girls had bullied her daughter so badly online at Crystal Lake Elementary School last year, that she pulled her daughter out to home school her for a while before sending her to Lawton Childs Middle Academy, where she seemed happy. Scroll Down for Video . Devastated: Tricia Norman (left) with her daughter Rebecca Ann Sedwick has spoken of her utter desolation at the news of her apparent suicide . However, Norman said that the group of five or six girls at Crystal Lake who bullied her on Facebook continued to torment the 12-year-old even after she had left. They would write that she was no good, ugly, stupid and 'that you should just go and kill yourself'. 'I guess for whatever reason, they just didn't like her,' said Tricia. Indeed, Norman said that she was so incensed by the bullying at Crystal Lake that she filed two complaints to the school. 'She has been bullied before and people had told her she needed to kill herself,' Sedwick’s sister, Summer Howard, said to The Ledger. 'But we all thought she was fine now. No one had known.' Half-a-Mile From Home: Rebecca was discovered at an abandoned cement factory near to her Lakeland, Florida, home . Lonely death: Rebecca Ann Sedwick's body was discovered at the base of this cement silo just a mile from her home . Tragically, Norman said that she was never informed that her daughter did not show up for class on Monday morning because of a problem with Lawton Chiles Middle Academy's automated system. In the hours after she was reported missing, deputies searching for her discovered her body at around 2.25 a.m. on the ground at a former Cemex cement site. Summer Howard said she told deputies that her sister had snuck into the site, around half a mile from their home, before and used to climb on the cement silos. Police forensic officers were seen on Tuesday afternoon at the top of one of the cement silos dusting for fingerprints. 'I don’t know what I’m doing,' Norman said to The Ledger. 'I don’t know what I’m supposed to do next. I just lost my world. 'My life is just never going to be the same, I’m missing a big part of it, a huge part of it.' Bullied: Rebecca was withdrawn from her elementary school for home-schooling in the aftermath of he cyberbullying being uncovered and her mother Tricia (right) said that she believes it to be a warning to all parents to be vigilant . Abuse: This is believed to be the Ask.Fm page of Rebecca Ann Sedwick - showing some examples of the attacks she suffered . The Polk Country Sheriff's Office revealed that Sedwick had been caught cutting herself and making comments about wanting to hurt herself before Monday, but Norman said she didn't know the cyber-bullying had resumed. 'She put on a perfect, happy face;she never told me,' Norman said to The Ledger. 'I never had a clue. I mean, she told me last year when she was being bullied but not this year and I have no idea why.' Norman said that the bullying at Crystal Lake became so bad earlier this year that her daughter was hospitalized with self-inflicted cuts on her arms and legs. 'When she was being bullied at Crystal Lake Middle, she used to come home every day and tell me how she wasn’t worth anything, that she was ugly, how she was stupid,' Norman said. 'And I said, ‘Baby what on earth would make you think that? You’re the most beautiful person I know and the smartest person I know.’ Struggling to deal with her sister's death, Howard said that even though she was close to Rebecca, she had no idea she was being bullied. 'She kept it all to herself,' Howard said. However, once police checked her cell phone they discovered that the bullying had not stopped, especially on Kik Messenger, Instagram and Ask.fm.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Nothing to fear. That's how a few of the first US athletes to arrive at the Sochi Games feel after getting their first look at an unprecedented security presence ringing the Olympics. With militant groups threatening to attack during the next few weeks, security and the safety of competitors and visitors to the coastal area and in the nearby mountains that will host the events has become both heightened and inescapable. Although the overwhelming forces - an estimated 100,000 police, agents and army troops are on hand - don't ensure there won't be any problems, the sheer numbers of security personnel have put some athletes at ease. Ring of steel: More than 100,000 Russian security personnel will be guarding the winter games in Sochi, Russia . Athletes and visitors will have to pass through security checkpoints in order to enter the venues for Olympic events . 'As far as safety over here, I'm looking at it from the standpoint of a soldier,' said U.S. bobsled member Dallas Robinson, who is also a sergeant in the Kentucky National Guard. 'A lot of our soldiers are in combat zones where there's hundreds of thousands of people who don't want them there, people that are headhunting. We're in an area where there's hundreds of thousands of people protecting us. 'I feel pretty safe.' So secure, in fact, that on Sunday Robinson and teammate Johnny Quinn ventured outside the athlete's village on bicycles and rode to the media center to get a better grasp of the immense security detail. 'We rode to the front door and circled around before four or five guards looked at us and finally said, ""Hey, you can't be here,""' Mr Robinson said. 'But they've been great. They've been respectful and very professional. 'We've had a lot of fun and I don't anticipate us being in any more harm's way than going down the mountain in a bobsled at 85 miles per hour.' In recent weeks, The US State Department warned Americans about traveling to Sochi and advised US athletes not to wear any team-issued uniform gear outside the venues, contending it could make them targets. Feeling safe: U.S. Men's Bobsleigh teammates Dallas Robinson - a soldier in the Kentucky National Guard - (left) and Johnny Quinn (right) said that after touring the Olympic compound, they both felt safe in Sochi . While American skeleton athlete John Daly is mindful of the advice and will be careful of his surroundings, the two-time Olympian is not going to hide his American pedigree. He intends to dress in the red, white and blue. 'I'm planning on wearing it out around here,' said Daly, from Smithtown, New York. ""Everyone back home kept saying, ""Oh, be careful and it's too bad you can't wear it."" But if they were here, they would realize how safe it is. 'It (security) is top notch. I don't think there's going to be an incident at all and if I didn't feel confident I wouldn't have my family come over. I'm glad they're here. I know they're safe and I've got full trust in Russia.' For many athletes, these early days in Russia are a chance to get acclimated to the change in climate and culture. There are new foods to sample at the 24-hour buffet, and it's a chance to make new friends from around the globe. Russian soldiers ride a chairlift above the Olympic downhill course at the Rosa Khutor alpine resort outside Sochi . But early Monday morning was devoted to a truly American tradition: watching the Super Bowl. Despite a nine-hour time difference, some members of the US contingent gathered in front of the TV to watch the Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos kick off at 3.30am local time. Well, not everyone. 'I didn't wake up (until) 6 o'clock to watch the last quarter and I was a little disappointed to come down and see the score,' said USA-1 bobsled driver Steven Holcomb, alluding to the Seahawks 43-8 blowout win. 'It was a little surprising.' Holcomb, a three-time Olympian and the defending gold medalist in four-man, hopes getting to Sochi early will put he and his teammates ahead of the field before they get to the track. 'I think right now we're at an advantage,' Holcomb said. 'We're getting used to the situation.' The US moguls team also deviated from past scripts, staying in the athletes village for the games, and reigning Olympic moguls champion Hannah Kearney said that's another advantage. From there, it's just a short trip for the skiers to the mountain and they can avoid an additional security check since they're already inside a secure area. Any way to be more relaxed helps, Kearney said. 'It's actually a little less stressful here. ... It's been wonderful,' Kearney said. 'Clearly, there have been a lot of questions about security, a lot of focus on it. I think with that it came in with some expectations that it would be different or more stressful, and it has not, which is great.'","100,000 Russian police officers, security agents and soldiers are in Sochi protecting the Olympic facilities .

Exotic yet easy to care for, it's no wonder Phalaenopsis are the country's most popular houseplant, accounting for a whopping 50 per cent of the market. You might imagine that these elegant plants - also known as moth orchids - are bred in steamily tropical climes before being imported to Britain, but actually, many of the orchids we buy are grown here. Even more surprisingly, they all start their life in a decidedly unglamorous test tube. A decade ago, orchids were an expensive treat: the only way to propagate them was by seed and it took years to bring an orchid to maturity. Phalaenopsis orchids at Double H Nurseries in Hampshire . All that changed with the invention of micropropagation, a cloning technique which allows a small section of flowering stem to be replicated in a laboratory. Suddenly orchids could be produced in just two years and, as prices plummeted, demand soared. Although there are thousands of different varieties of orchids, it's the Phalaenopsis, with their upright stems and open flowers, that we've fallen in love with. One of the big orchid growers in the UK is Double H Nurseries in Hampshire, which recently celebrated more than 50 years in business. It supplies plants to Marks & Spencer and Tesco, and as well as begonias, chrysanthemums and poinsettias, the company produces 1.5 million orchids a year. The Phalaenopsis, with their upright stems and open flowers, are the most popular breed of orchid. A giant glasshouse full of orchids in flower is a truly dazzling sight; wave after wave of white, pink, yellow, lime green and magenta, as far as the eye can see. These massed blooms have no scent, but that may change soon. 'There'll probably be a scented orchid on the market within ten years,' predicts Double H's commercial manager, Gary Shorland. 'The holy grail is a true red - that's probably five years away.' What about a blue orchid, I ask hopefully. 'Not within my lifetime,' Gary says, adding with a grimace, 'those blue ones you see in shops are dyed.' The company sources its young orchids from a laboratory in Germany. For the next year and a half the plants are grown on in the nursery: first in steamily hot temperatures where they get up to 20 hours of light; then, to encourage them into bloom, in a cooler glasshouse. Twenty-four hours after leaving the nursery, the orchids will be on sale in the shops. You can get orchids for under a tenner, but most of them sell for between £10 and £20. Phalaenopsis are popular all year round, but for Mother's Day sales go up five-fold. New and interesting orchids can sell for thousands  of pounds at auction to commercial growers, and in the next few years  we can expect to see lots of 'vintage-style' varieties - flowers in dusky pinks, or speckled with brown, or  with frilled edges. As Gary says,  'Phalaenopsis need hardly any care and they'll flower for up to three months, with new flowers opening every week. They're amazing - they really are the perfect indoor plant.'","Orchids are Britain's most popular house plant .

"By . Larisa Brown . When Weetabix last expanded their wholegrain product they went for chocolate chips and golden syrup. Now they are set to add green tea into the mix in a bid to appeal to the Chinese. The iconic cereal brand is hoping to crack the overseas market by adapting the traditional cereal to the Chinese preference for savoury tastes. Giles Turrell, chief executive of the Weetabix Food Company, said they were planning to experiment with a raft of different flavours, one of which would be the tea which originated in China. The iconic cereal brand is hoping to crack the overseas market by adapting the traditional cereal to the Chinese preference for savoury tastes . He said: ‘We’re having a think about what we’d add to Weetabix to make it savoury. ‘In the same way as we’ve added chocolate chips or golden syrup or banana to cereals here, you could add other savoury flavours, like green tea, sesame seeds, cranberries and other fruits.’ While the plans were still in their early stages, the research department in the UK is currently working with the flavour houses in China and consumer panels to test the flavours, he said. Within two years they are expecting to have adapted the range and have it selling on the foreign markets. Weetabix is being helped by its part-owners, the Bright Food Group, one of China’s biggest food manufacturers. While the plans were still in their early stages, the research department in the UK is currently working with the flavour houses in China and consumer panels to test the flavours . The company, which is based near Kettering in Northamptonshire, also owns Alpen, Ready Brek and Wheetos, as well as Barbaras in the US. Mr Turrell said Alpen could adapt well to Chinese tastes too ‘because it already has got oats and nuts, and multiple ingredients to which we can add savoury flavours'. He said their research had involved joining Chinese families for breakfast in their homes to understand their morning eating habits. He added: ‘A research company sets up a breakfast in consumer homes and we go and watch and ask questions. ‘Or we go on an accompanied shop to see what they buy and how they choose their food.’ Mr Turrell told the Daily Telegraph the results had not been that surprising. He added: ‘We have learned that they like savoury, not sweet, hot not cold, and fast because they are incredibly time-starved. ‘The analogy is that 10 years ago, coffee didn’t really exist as a habit in China – it was all tea. But now look at Starbucks or Costa and how successful they are.’ The cereal market in China is just £180 million, a mere fraction against the UK’ s £1.9 billion sales a year. In 2010, Weetabix claimed to have created the ‘holy grail’ of childrens’ breakfast time by introducing chocolate chips to their breakfast bars. They said Chocolate Weetabix had all the wholegrain goodness of regular Weetabix with just half the sugar of the average chocolate-flavoured breakfast cereal. In 2012 they added golden syrup to the equation, which again had the wholegrain content of their traditional product and half the usual sugar content of a sweetened cereal.","Cereal firm hoping to adapt Weetabix to Far Eastern tastes .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . It's news that may remove some of the guilt when quaffing wine at the Christmas party. Scientists have found that moderate alcohol consumption could bolster the immune system and potentially boost the body's ability to fight infections. The research could pave the way for potentially new ways of improving peoples’ ability to respond to vaccines and infections, benefiting vulnerable populations, such as the elderly for whom the flu vaccine, for example, has been found to be largely ineffective. U.S. scientists have found that moderate alcohol consumption, such as a glass of wine at dinner, could bolster people's immune systems and potentially boost our ability to fight infections . The study, conducted by an immunologist at the University of California, Riverside and published in the journal Vaccine, could also lead to a better understanding of how humans’ immune systems work. ‘It has been known for a long time that moderate alcohol consumption is associated with lower mortality,’ said Ilhem Messaoudi, lead author of the research paper and an associate professor of biomedical sciences at the university’s School of Medicine. ‘Our study, conducted on non-human primates, shows for the first time that voluntary moderate alcohol consumption boosts immune responses to vaccination,’ she said. To study the impact of alcohol consumption on the immune system, the researchers trained 12 Rhesus macaques to consume alcohol on their own accord. They first vaccinated the animals against small pox and then allowed them to access either four per cent ethanol, as well as water as an alternative fluid and food. To study the impact of alcohol consumption on the immune system, the researchers trained 12 Rhesus macaques (pictured) to consume alcohol on their own accord . The researchers then monitored the animals' daily alcohol consumption for 14 months and vaccinated the animals again seven months after the experiment began. The team found that over nine months after the animals began self-administering alcohol, their daily ethanol intake varied markedly among them. ‘Like humans, rhesus macaques showed highly variable drinking behaviour,’ Professor Messaoudi said. ‘Some animals drank large volumes of ethanol, while others drank in moderation.’ Animals that consumed more alcohol, averaged a blood ethanol concentration greater than the legal limit of 0.08 per cent and were therefore designated 'heavy drinkers.' Monkeys in the second group consumed less alcohol and typically had blood ethanol concentrations of between 0.02 and 0.04 per cent, making them 'moderate drinkers'. ‘Prior to consuming alcohol, all the animals showed comparable responses to vaccination,’ Professor Messaoudi said. The research could pave the way for potentially new ways of improving peoples' ability to respond to vaccines and infections . ‘Following exposure to ethanol, however, the animals showed markedly different responses after receiving the booster vaccine.’ The researchers found that as expected, the animals that drank the largest amounts of alcohol showed greatly diminished vaccine responses compared to the control group. But animals that drank moderate amounts of ethanol displayed enhanced vaccine responses. ‘These surprising findings indicate that some of the beneficial effects of moderate amounts of alcohol consumption may be manifested through boosting the body's immune system,’ Professor Messaoudi said. ‘This supports what has been widely believed for some time: moderate ethanol consumption results in a reduction in all causes of mortality, especially cardiovascular disease. 'As for excessive alcohol consumption, our study shows that it has a significant negative impact on health.’ Alcohol abuse kills 22,000 people prematurely in the UK, according to Pru Health and approximately 25,000 people in the U.S. annually. Around a third of men and a fifth of women in the UK admitted drinking over the weekly recommendations. ‘If you have a family history of alcohol . abuse, or are at risk, or have been an abuser in the past, we are not . recommending you go out and drink to improve your immune system,' Professor Messaoudi said. ‘But for the average person that has, say, a glass of wine with dinner, it does seem, in general, to improve heath and cardiovascular function in particular, and now we can add the immune system to that list. ‘Next, we plan to harness our observations made in this study to address bigger questions on the immune system, such as how can we boost our immune responses to vaccination, a particular challenge for our elderly.’","U.S. scientists have found for the first time that voluntary moderate alcohol consumption boosts immune responses to vaccination .

"By . Monty Don . PUBLISHED: . 17:30 EST, 28 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 17:30 EST, 28 March 2014 . My garden has evolved slowly over the past 20 years but about 15 years ago we made a decision, based upon the wet, grey winters, to create an elaborate and strong structure using mainly box - Buxus sempervirens. Box is one of our few native evergreens and has been used since Roman times as the perfect plant to train into a low, evergreen hedge that only needs clipping once a year to hold its shape well. It’s expensive to buy - so I began the process of raising thousands of plants from cuttings. Slowly, these became strong plants and the miles of box hedging began to create the vibrant structure I wanted, even in the middle of the darkest days of winter. Monty has had trouble with box blight that causes the interior of box plants to die back . Box is - was - famously tough and trouble-free. The plants I raised were - I believed - set to last for scores, even hundreds of years of unhindered growth. But two years ago I noticed one area had started to die back. Q. Will we get any fruit from our three-year-old peach tree this year? Richard Jarvis, CambsA. Peach trees usually fruit after three to five years. They need to be in well-drained, fertile soil in the sunniest position possible. Mulch liberally each spring with garden compost and water generously once a week. Do not prune other than to remove any dead or damaged branches. Q. The box cuttings I took last autumn and have kept in an unheated greenhouse still have no roots. What's wrong? Mrs S Horton, Isle of WightA. A timely question given my box problems. Cuttings taken last autumn will not show any growth until this spring. Leave them in the pots until September, by which time they should have formed roots. Carefully remove and plant them out. And watch out for box blight! Q. How do I pleach my hornbeam hedge? Mary Harris, WarksA. Do you really mean 'pleach' - a pleached hedge has bare trunks with the hedge raised up in the air - or 'lay'? A laid hedge should be about 3.3m (10ft) tall, with the trunks cut through until only flaps of bark remain, then woven between upright stakes. The plants of a pleached hedge should be placed at 2m (6ft 6in) intervals, then trained onto a wire or bamboo structure. Keep clipping the sides hard to encourage lateral growth, then tie this into the supporting structure. It takes about ten years to achieve a fully formed pleached hornbeam hedge. The green foliage was turning grey and brown and collapsing in a mouldy mess. Otherwise unaffected leaves were showing chocolate coloured stains. I knew at once that this was one of my worst nightmares - the dreaded box blight. There are two forms of box blight, Volutella buxi and Cylindrocladium buxicola, both fungi that cause the interior of box plants to die back. Both types of fungi need humid, warm conditions to thrive and the past few years have been perfect for their spread. V. buxi needs open wounds - like those created every time box is clipped - to infect the host plant, whereas C. buxicola can infect unwounded plants and is the more pernicious of the two, affecting quite woody stems as well as the foliage. The worst damage appears in August and September - and when it arrives the plants can die back in a matter of days. The best solution is to cut out all affected growth - and burn it. Gather up all fallen leaves and remove the top layer of mulch or soil that can harbour spores. From the first patch I noticed in September 2012 the blight has ripped through our box hedges, leaving the crisp green ravaged with bare, brown patches. Some of these will regrow but will almost certainly be hit again in a cycle that will eventually kill the plants. The crispness and the green is never again going to be re- created by these box plants. It is possible that all the box in the garden will be blighted, including the 64 box balls that I treasure dearly. We have some hedges of Buxus sempervirens ‘Handsworthiensis’ that have coarser, thicker leaves which are more resistant - but still get affected. So we are taking drastic action to try to limit the spread. Badly affected hedges are being dug up and burnt - the work of 15 years going up in flames. What do we do? Plants that are clearly untouched are being taken to a piece of land 30 miles away that has no box - so no blight - and placed in quarantine for a full calendar year. Any box that is not hedging is having the affected growth cut right back in the hope that the regrowth will be unaffected. The chances are slim but it is worth trying. We could replace the low box hedges with a substitute evergreen plant like Ilex crenata, euonymus, pittisporum or myrtle. None of these appeal to me and I am inclined to embrace the forced change and see it as a creative opportunity. However, the taller hedges - 1m (3ft) high and more - would look just as good in yew, which grows very well here and now is the perfect time to plant it. So one door closes - with a slam - but as ever in a garden, another opens.","Monty Don has spent 15 years growing an ornamental hedge .

More than 100 million burgers were eaten as the first meal of the day last year as the breakfast burger soars in popularity. When British people's breakfast eating habits were monitored, the study showed burger servings before 11 am are up more than six per cent since 2012. British people are turning their backs on the traditional breakfast and are instead opting to start the day with a burger . But despite its . growing popularity, bacon sandwiches remain the breakfast of . choice for British people eating on the go, with 268 million of them . eaten for breakfast last year. Just five years ago the breakfast burger only accounted for one in 16 burgers that were bought throughout the day. Now around one in 12 are bought as a morning meal with the trend for early morning burgers set to grow. The data comes from the latest research by the NPD Group, which studied what Britons are choosing for breakfast when they are away from home. The growing popularity of the breakfast burger means people are shunning traditional fare such as cereal, right. However, the bacon sandwich, left is still the nation's favourite . It also seems that children are driving . the breakfast burger trend, with adults accompanied by youngsters eating their way through more than 40 million of them as a start to the . day. Jack MacIntyre, UK foodservice account manager for the NPD Group, said: 'When people eat breakfast - perhaps on the way to work, or in the office, or as a treat at weekends - burgers are clearly growing in popularity. 'But the breakfast classics - servings of good old-fashioned bacon sandwiches, toast, eggs, sausage and baked beans - are unlikely to be toppled anytime soon. 'And, despite Britain's improving café culture, it doesn't look like continental breakfast favourites such as the croissant are going to sidetrack the appeal of the Great British breakfast.'

"By . Dan Bloom . Palace: The treehouse in Oxfordshire took a group of 25 people three years to build . An award-winning treehouse which teenagers spent three years building 85ft up a lime tree will be torn down over health and safety fears. The group of boys built the lofty eight-storey-high home with a front door, windows, a spiral staircase and a viewing platform in a farmer's field near the village of Lower Heyford, Oxfordshire. But the farmer said it must be torn down because he could be sued if someone fell off - and it is so entwined in branches, the whole tree will have to be felled. The five main builders of the treehouse, which was worked on by 25 youngsters, said they were 'gutted' at the demolition but understood why it had to happen. Dougie Haynes, Joe East, Buzz Burrell, Harry Court, Alden Conley and Ollie Cavey estimate 1,000 hours of work went into the hideout, which began modestly three years ago. Work escalated last summer as they scavenged for materials from skips and built upon the 45ft home they had already constructed with no more tools than nails and a hammer. Mr Haynes, 19, who hopes to study architecture at university, said: 'At the end of the day I will accept it but I will be pretty gutted about it as I put so much time into it. This summer could have been pretty awesome.' 'In about October we started building the top half and it coincided with the leaves falling off - that's when villagers started to notice it. 'I would say you have to be pretty reckless to ever fall or hurt yourself. We are always very careful with new people. Mr Haynes, who works at a shopping centre and with a carpenter, added: 'The worst injury I ever had there was I stood on a nail, that was when I was building it. I would not say it's dangerous at all.' The astonishing palace in the sky was entered into a competition on Facebook to find the nation's best treehouse, and scooped the top prize. The judges of the Blue Forest's Treehouse Competition praised it for being 'ludicrously high up' and reminded them of 'those halcyon days we all spent playing in a treehouse when we were younger'. Who'd live in a house like this? From left, Alden Conley, Harry Court and Dougie Haynes, who built the tree . A room with a view: The group built the 85ft home with nothing more than wood, nails and a hammer . Home comforts: They have even managed to haul a wicker sofa up into the tree - but the owner of the farm on which they built, Tim Taylor, fears he will be sued if someone falls to their death from the treetop home . They also said it felt homely and had 'a strong feeling of the personality of everyone that created and continues to enjoy this treehouse.' Farmer Tim Taylor said: 'I didn't know until it had been built. 'They would have been alright if they had stayed [at 40ft] but it's 80ft up. They went up above the canopy. 'Once I knew that, and people got on to me, I mentioned it to my insurance people and I dare not let it stay there. It's just too ridiculous. You can see it from everywhere. 'It's very unfortunate. If I could see a way to leave it there I would have done. 'But if someone falls and breaks something it will be my problem.' Leafy neighbourhood: The young men said villagers started to notice the home late in its construction . Treemendous: Dougie Haynes, left with friends Alden Conley and Harry Court, wants to be an architect . The leafy home may be impressive, but it is far from the only ultra-ambitious treehouse in the world. The dense forests of North America have several treetop homes which would not look out of place in fantasy novels. Many were built as pet projects by carpenters or run as boutique hotels. At Treehotel in rural northern Sweden, guests pay hundreds of pounds a night to stay in treehouses shaped like birds nests or made out of mirrors. Those who want to take their lives in their hands by enjoying the Oxfordshire treehouse do not have long, however - as it is thought it will be felled in just a few weeks.","A 25-strong group spent three years building palace in rural Oxfordshire .

"By . Ben Spencer . Parts of storm-battered Britain have suffered the greatest loss of trees in a generation, the National Trust has said. The worst-hit areas have suffered up to 15 storms over the last three months, losing thousands of trees that have stood for decades. This winter has been the wettest for 250 years, with a relentless series of vicious storms sweeping in from the Atlantic. Stourhead in Wiltshire lost 400 trees, including this 250-year-old oak planted by the man who created the landscaped garden . Winds of up to 40mph have blasted the nation’s coastlines since December, tearing across the country and creating untold devastation. The greatest losses have been among ancient oak, ash and beech trees, experts said, with damage to some woodlands the greatest since the Great Storm of 1987. But given the extent of the wild weather, which hit the western half of England, Wales and Northern Ireland particularly badly, losses could have been worse, the National Trust said. The charity has surveyed more than 50 of its sites, with many gardeners, rangers and foresters saying that the losses of trees has been the greatest since 1987. Killerton Estate in Devon suffered some of the biggest losses, with more than 500 trees blown over, including 20 that were significant to the estate’s landscaping. A 600 year old oak tree blown over by the storms at Woolbeding Garden in Sussex which Benjamin Disraeli called 'the greenest valley with the prettiest river in the world' Specimen trees have been badly damaged or blown over in gardens and parks, particularly in south-west England and Wales, but gardens outside the west have also suffered, with Tatton Park near Manchester, Nymans in Sussex and Scotney Castle in Kent all affected. Stourhead in Wiltshire lost 400 trees, including a 250-year-old oak planted by the man who created the landscaped garden. Historically important trees have been lost, including a rare black walnut at Hatfield Forest, which was the largest in Essex. Matthew Oates, the trust’s nature and wildlife specialist, described the lost ancient trees as ‘nature’s cathedrals’. One of the reasons for the extensive damage was the heavy rain which accompanied the storms, he said, creating waterlogged ground and increasing the chance they would be toppled. Lots of trees have come down on the south of the Brownsea Island in Poole Harbour with the south-easterly winds blowing in from the English Channel . Mr Oates said: ‘Too many old beech, oak and ash trees have been lost. These are important habitats, for bats, beetles, flies and fungi, though a whole series of species colonise and utilise them once they fall, and drive the rotting down process. ‘People love and need trees, and the loss of specimen trees in gardens and parks, and of ancient beeches and oaks in the woods and wider countryside, hurts us all and damages much wildlife. ‘We value and venerate these old sentinels and need to become increasingly aware of the power of the weather. ‘Increased storminess, and increased extreme weather events generally, are likely to stress trees further, especially veteran trees. We will have to think carefully about where we establish trees and what species we plant.’ The Woodland Trust, which looks after 1,000 woodland sites across the country, echoed the National Trust’s comments.

It's just a couple of miles from  Shepperton film studios - where movies such as The Third Man, The Omen, Alien and Shakespeare In Love were filmed - and Creek House has played its own part in showbiz history. The Canadian-born British TV personalities  Bernard Braden and his wife Barbara Kelly once owned the 19th Century, seven-bedroom mansion - which is now on the market for a guide price of £3 million. Bernard and Barbara were household names in the 1950s and 1960s. Bernard is best remembered for ITV's On The Braden Beat - a precursor to Esther Rantzen's That's Life - in which he showcased his acerbic wit. Creek House, Shepperton, bought for £650,000 by Mr Barry and Mrs Jane Wilkinson . Barbara is remembered for regular appearances on the hugely popular BBC Sunday night panel show What's My Line? In the couple's heyday, House & Garden magazine devoted eight pages to an 'at home' interview with them and their three children. The couple spent nine years at Creek House, in Surrey, where the garden leads down to Millbrook Creek, which flows into the Thames. In 1959 they sold the house to actor John Gregson and his wife Thea, who lived there with their six children. Gregson starred in 40 films, including Ealing comedies Whisky Galore! and The Lavender Hill Mob. But he is renowned for the Bafta-winning 1953 picture Genevieve, in which he starred alongside Kenneth More. He died aged 55 in 1975. Earlier, the pub down the road from . Creek House was a focus of Hollywood gossip, as it was where trysts . between Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor were conducted while Taylor . was still married to Eddie Fisher. 'The Gregsons held parties here where they played host to stars such as Peter O'Toole, Peter Ustinov and Vivien Leigh,' says current owner Barry Wilkinson, 74. 'We feel very dull in comparison,' says his wife Jane, 67. While the central part of the house is Georgian in style, there are sprawling Arts and Crafts and Victorian additions that the Wilkinsons believe were added by an early architect owner. These include a stunning room at the top of the house with stained-glass windows and a vaulted ceiling - now Barry's study. Former resident John Gregson in a scene from the 1949 film Whisky Galore! The Wilkinsons bought the house 16 years . ago from a dentist who had bought it from Thea Gregson. She had stayed . on in the house for several years after John's death. Thea is still alive and living in the Cotswolds and until recently made twice-yearly pilgrimages to Creek House. A devout Catholic, she built a small - and unconsecrated - chapel  in the grounds which still stands today on the acre of land across the creek which is included in the house sale. When the Wilkinsons bought it for £650,000, they had a teenage son and daughter and the house was in need of a lot of work. 'We were living in Woking and had no intention of moving, but a property magazine  came through the letterbox and we couldn't resist coming to have a look,' says Jane,  who used to run her own human resources consultancy. Three days later they had put  in an offer, despite their home not being on the market. The couple spent £250,000 rewiring, installing a new roof, ripping out the dated bathrooms and moving the kitchen from a small anteroom to the middle of the house, where it now looks over the garden down to the creek. They kept one part of the house as a self-contained cottage, which they now let out. The couple retained original features, such as the stunning oak panels in the drawing room, and replaced some of the broken sash windows and doors. They uncovered original fireplaces, which had been painted or boarded over, and restored some stained-glass windows. They had the garden redesigned and landscaped and renovated stone balustrades on the patio. 'I love to restore things - it was a labour of love,' says Barry, a former accountant who retired a year into the three-year project. We hired a builder to do the work for us but I was his apprentice and learnt a lot from him.' The warm, comfortable sitting room at Creek House . According to estate agent Russell Gooden of Jackson-Stops & Staff, Creek House is so unique that there is little to compare it to in the vicinity, although he explains it's not uncommon to pay a 35 to 40 per cent premium for a waterside property in Shepperton. He says prices in the area have been pushed up because of a lack of stock, adding: 'Traditionally, the beginning of the year is a time  to sell, but we haven't seen the usual influx. Mortgages are a little more difficult to get so perhaps people who want to move are unable to do so and a lot of people are still sitting on the fence.' Barry and Jane are now downsizing and plan to buy something smaller in the area. 'We feel very rooted here,' says Jane. 'Shepperton is very villagey and has a great sense of community. People tend to stay a long time.' Who do they expect to buy the house next? 'I've got an image of a young family who would really enjoy being at Creek House,' adds Jane.

But when it came to the final procedure, having her six front teeth replaced, the 20-year-old  was stunned to be told she might have to foot the bill because getting her smile back would count as a cosmetic procedure. The advertising assistant was left in a coma for a week after being hit by a car when she was cycling back from work in November last year. Alex Kerr, 20, from Milton Keynes lost six of her teeth in a cycling accident, before and after images are shown left to right.  Northampton General Hospital told Miss Kerr her teeth were not restored because the procedure isn't regarded as 'acute care' and she is waiting to see if payment for the £12,000 treatment will be approved .

She . is now facing an anxious wait to see if the NHS will approve  payment . for the treatment – and claims the only way to get it sooner would be to . fork out £12,000 of her own money. She . said: ‘I read in magazines all the time about people who have boob . jobs, nose jobs and other cosmetic surgery on the NHS because their . confidence needs boosting. ‘Yet nobody seems to understand how awful it is to have no front teeth at my age. ‘I . didn’t mean this to happen and I didn’t just go to the doctor and say I . had a lack of self-confidence and so needed some teeth. ‘I had been in an accident and you would think it would be a priority for them to help me.’ Miss Kerr, left, pictured with her boyfriend Daniel Few before the accident. She broke her pelvis, snapped her jaw and was in a coma for a week following the collision last November. Miss Kerr claims she has been unfairly treated, while the NHS prioritise boob jobs and tummy tucks . A private dentist has offered to perform the procedure for free, if Miss Kerr, pictured here with her friend Louise Cafey, will pay for the materials. Miss Kerr said she had been initially led to believe her treatment would be carried out for free, but was told it wouldn't be at a follow-up appointment . Miss .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Abercrombie and Fitch CEO Mike Jeffries may want to reconsider his plan to not market the company's threads to plus-sized patrons - because it seems the A and F brand could use all the business it can get. The company announced Friday its first quarter earnings, which fell drastically short of Wall Street's expectations - according to the company, its first-quarter sales in the U.S. fell by 17 percent, which many are crediting to offensive comments made by Jeffries in a 2006 interview that recently resurfaced. 'Cool kids': Abercrombie and Fitch CEO Mike Jeffries said in 2006 that a lot of people 'don't belong' in the retailer's clothes - they're only for 'cool kids' “In every school there are the cool and popular kids, and then there are the not-so-cool kids,” Jeffries said in a 2006 Salon article. “Candidly, we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don’t belong [in our clothes], and they can’t belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely.” The comments re-emerged - nearly six years later - in a Business Insider blog post explaining how Abercrombie and Fitch doesn't offer plu-sized clothes for women, and the exclusionary nature of Jeffries' comments has put the retailer in the cross-hairs of equality and anti-bullying groups. Over the last several weeks, protesters have been expressing their outrage over Jeffries' comments at Abercrombie and Fitch stores all over the country, as well as at the company's corporate headquarters in New Albany, Ohio. There currently is a Change.org petition circulating calling on Abercrombie and Fitch to 'stop telling teens they aren't beautiful; make clothes for teens of all sizes.' It currently has 72,455 signatures. 'FitchTheHomeless': Greg Karber protests Abercrombie's 'exclusionary' practices by handing out the company's clothes to homeless people . In one of the more creative demonstrations, a California man named Greg Karber started a campaign called 'FitchTheHomeless,' which consists of him handing out Abercrombie and Fitch clothing to homeless people. His campaign has been both praised and criticized, with critics saying it suggests that homeless people are inherently 'uncool and unattractive as it gets.' See video of Karber's campaign below . Since the uproar over his comments began, Jeffries has made multiple apologies that many have considered half-hearted. 'We want to reiterate that we sincerely regret and apologize for any offense caused by comments we have made in the past which are contrary to these values."" one apology says in part. 'Plus sized': Mike Jeffries would be appalled . In regards to his company's disappointing financial numbers, Jeffries claims in a statement to investors that 'the first quarter proved to be more difficult than expected on the . top-line due to more significant inventory shortage issues than . anticipated, added to by external pressures.' Abercrombie and Fitch's stock prices closed today down $4.35 to $50.02. In comparison, stock prices today for Aeropostale Inc. and Gap Inc. - two of Abercrombie and Fitch's biggest competitors - were down $1.72 and $.72, respectively.","Abercrombie and Fitch's first-quarter sales fell by 17 percent .

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Police have launched an investigation after a 15-year-old ‘child bride’ featured on Benefits Street. Neither producers nor Channel 4 contacted police or social services, despite filming the girl’s Romanian husband Stefan Stana admitting that he had flouted British law. He admitted on camera: ‘My wife is 15 and a half and I am 20. This scares people in England because she is a minor.’ 'This scares people': Stefan and Madalina on the second episode of Channel 4's Benefits Street . Only a few months later,  the teenager, thought to be called Madalina Balasa,  gave birth to a baby girl in a Birmingham hospital. Campaigners accused Channel 4 of turning a blind eye to underage marriage. But a spokesman for the broadcaster said: ‘There was no evidence of coercion or exploitation and the relationship appeared entirely genuine. 'The husband was clearly aware that there are differences in the law between countries and this was made clear in the programme.’ He added that informing the authorities would have compromised the trust the couple placed in documentary-makers Love Productions that allowed them to speak ‘openly, candidly and in confidence’. But Birmingham Council criticised the broadcaster for putting their programme ahead of the welfare of Madalina, who married Stefan in Romania. Investigation: Officers are 'keen to speak to' the couple, who no longer live on James Turner Street . ‘We would urge anyone who is aware of someone in a similar situation to contact the police or social services,’ said a spokesman. ‘Indeed, we would have expected the film company  to have done this.’ The NSPCC, Action for Children, Birmingham Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming and the Children’s Commissioner for England also expressed concerns. Police said: ‘We are investigating along with Birmingham Social Services.’ The couple no longer live in the street so officers are ‘keen to speak to her’ or anyone who knows her whereabouts.

"By . Jenny Hope . A new treatment could bring hope to thousands of shingles sufferers with long-term pain. Trials of the experimental drug EMA401 found it cut pain levels by at least 30 per cent for more than half of sufferers - some of whom had been in agony for years. Pain relief was experienced after just four weeks of taking two pills a day, according to a study published in The Lancet medical journal. A bout of shingles puts you at higher risk of having a stroke or heart attack years later, a study shows . British researchers behind the study hope the breakthrough will benefit patients with post-shingles pain, and many more with other intractable pain conditions. Because the drug works in a different way to conventional painkillers, it may be able to treat chronic nerve pain from diabetes, HIV, nerve injury and cancer chemotherapy. Shingles is caused by reactivation of the virus that causes chickenpox and affects 190,000 Britons each year, most of them aged over 50. After a case of chickenpox the virus is not eliminated but retreats to clusters of sensory nerve cells, usually near the spinal cord, where it remains in a dormant state. But, as immunity weakens with age or as a result of stress, the virus can reactivate, leading to a painful rash. For one in 10 patients, the permanent nerve damage caused by the virus results in post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), the medical term for post-shingles pain. This can be severely debilitating, causing burning, throbbing and stabbing pain which is difficult to treat. Pain relief was experienced after just four weeks of taking two pills a day, according to a study . Conventional painkilling agents often fail to work, and can have unpleasant or disabling side effects. The study involved 183 patients aged 22-89 years in six countries who had had PHN for at least six months. The study compared EMA401 with a placebo or dummy treatment, with participants taking two pills a day for four weeks. Altogether 58 per cent of participants taking the drug found it effective, reducing pain by at least 30 per cent by blocking pain pathways in a novel way. It did not cause any serious side effects. Study leader Professor Andrew Rice, from the Department of Surgery and Cancer at Imperial College London, said ‘Conventional painkillers don’t tend to help people with severe chronic neuropathic pain and most available treatments have modest efficacy and/or are limited by side effects. ‘We are therefore keen to find new ways of providing these people with some relief. ‘A positive trial like this in such a challenging condition as post-herpetic neuralgia, for a drug that acts in a new way, is unusual and very exciting. ‘We hope that the new drug will ultimately offer hope for patients who aren’t helped by current treatments.’ Prof Rice said neuropathic was caused by hyper-excitability of the nerves. He said ‘The drug is probably blocking the hyper-excitability associated with nerve damage.’ He said it would be taken long-term by patients, in the same way that arthritis patients need regular medication. Marian Nicholson from the Shingles Support Society said ‘This is a positive development and we very much welcome it. Research carried out so far seems to indicate that the treatment is safe, so we hope that new trials with higher doses can make it even more effective.’ She added ‘Shingles pain, or PHN mainly affects the elderly. It can render a patient’s final years an unendurable misery. Prompt treatment may help to prevent this, so we urge anyone who thinks they may have shingles to go to the doctor immediately.’ Spinifex Pharmaceuticals, the Australian based company which owns the drug, now plans a larger trial testing higher doses of the drug for longer periods of time. Prof Rice said ‘We are looking forward to seeing how EMA401 performs in a larger trial in people with post-herpetic neuralgia, where we will explore higher doses, and in trials where we will analyse its efficacy in other chronic pain conditions.‘Identifying the characteristics of the patients who do get good pain relief from EMA401 will also be an important avenue for research.’ Tom McCarthy, CEO of Spinifex Pharmaceuticals, said ‘There is a clear need for new treatments that bring patients pain relief with fewer side effects. ‘In addition to post-herpetic neuralgia, we see broad potential for EMA401 to treat a range of chronic painful conditions such as pain due to osteoarthritis and diabetes.’ Since September certain older people qualify for one-off vaccination against shingles on the NHS - those aged 70 or 79. Research last month found having shingles puts you at higher risk of having a stroke or heart attack years later, particularly when the attack occurs before the age of 40.","Trials of experimental drug EMA401 found it cut pain levels for half sufferers .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Winter flooding has wiped out 17,500 acres of cider orchards, growers warned yesterday. The downpours in the South mean many of the million apple trees planted across the country in the past ten years will be lost. Farmers face an agonising wait until May to see if the water has destroyed their livelihoods, or whether some of the fruit trees will defy the odds and blossom. Warning: A small orchard in Somerset which was swamped by the flooding event at the beginning of 2014 . Julian Temperley, one of Somerset's most famous growers, said it was hard to remain upbeat and described his 170 acres as 'touch and go'. 'We've had an appalling late December, January and February - trees over the whole of the South West have taken a hammering,' Julian, from Martock, Somerset, said. 'There's certainly a big worry about waterlogged trees - there will be a considerable number dying. We have one orchard that's been under a foot of water. I'm not certain if the trees will survive.' Just 14 days underwater can destroy an apple tree's root system, a time limit easily passed this winter. It is believed that a huge proportion of the UK's 17,300 acres of cider orchards may have been ruined by the rain and floods. Despite a fortnight of recent intermittent sunshine, which has seen some fruit trees blossom in earnest, - with fruit already set - growers have warned there is no guarantee of success. Trees in Somerset are reflected in flood water during the flooding event at the beginning of 2014 . There are around 480 cider-makers across the country and the traditional trade plays a crucial role in the UK's rural economy and communities . The crisis has prompted the National Association of Cider Makers to prepare for the worst, and issue a stark warning crops may not live up to expectations for the next few years. Paul Bartlett, chairman, said: 'We hope for the best though recognise that the potential impact could seriously affect the income of growers this season and for several years to come.' The devastation has worried companies such as Bulmers, the world's largest producer of cider, which takes 90 per cent of its apples from local orchards. Cider drinking in Britain is on the increase with around 1.5 billion pints downed each year . And the weather could spark a second year of worry for grower Kier Rogers, who last year lost hundreds of trees through groundwater flooding, after prolonged rain made drainage impossible. Mr Rogers, from Herefordshire, said: 'We've had surface water here since the end of December when it started raining - and that causes me great concern - I don't know what the long-term effects will be on the trees, and the damage we will see this year.' There are around 480 cider-makers across the country and the traditional trade plays a crucial role in the UK's rural economy and communities. Cider drinking in Britain is on the increase with around 1.5 billion pints downed each year. The industry is worth £3 billion and rising and cider and perry account for nine per cent of all alcohol consumed nationally. The picture paints a direct contrast to last year when the cider industry was toasting its best harvest in a decade. The weather over 2013 created ideal conditions for a tasty, bumper apple crop and led to a huge jump in profits. Just ten years ago the cider industry used 110,000 tonnes of UK-grown apples but now the figure has more than doubled to 250,000 tonnes.","Downpours mean apple trees across the country will be lost .

"By . Shari Miller . With litter strewn across the street and bin bags stacked high, James Turner Street was certainly the least likely candidate to win any prizes for looking pretty. But the Birmingham residents are hoping to turn that unsavoury reputation on its head by bidding for glory in this year's Britain in Bloom competition. Millions watched as James Turner Street in Winson Green, Birmingham, became the litter-strewn scene for the most controversial documentary on British TV. Digging in: Sue Godridge pictured with Councillor Chaman Lal, Scott Tidman  and Andrew Simons, hopes James Turner Street can win Britain in Bloom . No prizes here: James Turner Street was depicted as filled with litter in the Channel 4 series, Benefits Street . Swearing, drug taking, shoplifting and anti-social behaviour attracted hundreds of complaints and helped the five-part series make headlines around the world. In the second episode, filmed last year, viewers watched as rubbish was left to pile high in the road after the council's binmen refused to collect the waste because bags were opened by gangs searching for scrap metal. It was amid this battle of the bin bags that determined James Turner Street resident Sue Godrige boldly decided to enter her road in the Britain in Bloom contest. Now the 79-year-old is leading her neighbourhood's entry in this year's competition. The campaign was launched yesterday with a family-friendly Big Dig Day at the community garden on the grounds of Bishop Latimer United Church, situated behind James Turner Street. Several of Sue's neighbours turned out to support the event, but as they set to work there was no sign of some of the the documentary's biggest contributors, including White Dee, Black Dee, Fungi and young couple Mark and Becky. 'We're hoping to do a bit better than eighth place this year,' said Sue. 'Britain in Bloom is 50 this year so we're trying to make everything gold and will be growing lots of sunflowers.' Like many of the show's 'stars', Sue accused the Channel 4 documentary makers at Love Productions of 'cleverly editing' the series to make it more explosive and appealing to viewers. 'They did a lot filming here in the garden, but did not put it on TV, which was disappointing,' she said. 'It wasn't quite as eye-catching as some of the other scenes I suppose. 'They exaggerated it with all the cigarettes and tinnies in the street - some people said they (the film-makers) gave them to residents. 'The programme showed loads of people spilling out onto the street at night, but it's nothing like that.' Controversy: Benefits Street and its participants, including White Dee, sparked debate across the nation . The film-makers have insisted that the series was accurate and representative. They have also denied giving cigarettes and alcohol to encourage contributors to go before the cameras. The show portrayed James Turner Street and many of its inhabitants in a poor light, but Sue insisted a lot of good had come from it. She said: 'I had a laugh when I watched it. 'I think it's brought the community closer together. 'It also highlighted a lot of problems we had concerning scavengers taking rubbish out of the bin bags. 'Since then, the council have been on top of it and the waste collections have never been affected. 'It was no more damaging than if it had been filmed on any other street in any other major city. 'We've had hundreds of people come from all over to visit the street and have their picture taken with us. 'We have a very mixed community here and there's no problems with each other, which I think came across on the show. 'It's been good publicity on the whole.' Seeds for success: Residents of Winson Green Joy Bailey and Sonia Peyando get behind the competition . Sue said she did not begrudge White Dee, real name Deirdre Kelly, from appearing on other TV shows and writing in magazines. 'I keep saying to people that with all the TV appearances she's making she's likely to come off benefits soon,' she said. 'That's got to be good for everyone.' But Councillor Chaman Lal, who joined the Big Dig Day, said it was people like Sue who were the 'true heroes' of Benefits Street - and the Winson Green community. 'People talk about White Dee being the mother of the street, but these are the true heroes who give up their time, voluntarily, to enhance the area,' he said. 'Winson Green has had a lot of bad press, so it's time the area moved on and hopefully this Britain in Bloom campaign can help with that. 'Gardening is a recreational activity that is good for health and well-being, but also allows people to grow their own food which is important in the current economic climate.' The community garden is an integral part of Winson Green's Britain in Bloom scheme spearheaded by the Winson Green Neighbourhood Forum, the local church and ward councillors. The once-overgrown site has been transformed since 2009 into a pleasant green space thanks to a £20,000 injection from various partners and agencies. Changing the reputation: James Turner Street residents are bidding for first prize in the Britain in Bloom competition . It now contains a sensory garden, a woodland walkway, a wildlife pond, raised beds suitable for people with disabilities, and a poly tunnel for growing less hardy vegetables. Project leader Andrew Simons said some of the soil beds were being used by pupils from three local schools to grow fresh produce. He said: 'The area has received some negative press after Benefits Street, but the garden has already had such a positive impact on the community. 'It encourages people of all ages, abilities and backgrounds to gettogether and learn about natural systems and biodiversity. 'It provides physical health benefits by engaging people in outdoor activity and growing local food using organic methods. 'The creation of spaces within the garden for quiet reflection and relaxation also provides benefits for mental health and emotional wellbeing.' As part of the Britain in Bloom campaign, plant pots will be issued to local residents for them to paint, fill and hang outside their homes. Mr Simons added: 'We're asking people to sign up for a plant pot. 'It's all about resident participation, trying to get people to put their rubbish out on the right day and discard of garden waste properly.'","James Turner Street earned unsavoury reputation on Channel 4 series .

"By . Ian Drury . Two Al Qaeda terrorists who plotted to kill thousands of innocent people in bomb attacks in Britain are attempting to have their convictions quashed on human rights grounds. Extremists Salahuddin Amin and Rangzieb Ahmed, both British citizens, claim their trials were unfair because UK spies knew some of the information used against them was obtained during their torture by Pakistani security services. Their argument has previously been rejected by the UK courts. Salahuddin Amin, left, and Rangzieb Ahmed, right, both convicted terrorists, have launched an attempt to have their convictions quashed on human rights grounds .

Omar Khyam, 25, was found guilty by a jury at the Old Bailey of conspiracy to cause explosions likely to endanger life . Now the pair have been given a green . light to put their case to the European Court of Human Rights in a . last-ditch bid to be freed. If the case is not thrown out it will be the first time British terrorist convictions have been challenged in Strasbourg. It has provoked outrage because the . European Court would normally have declared the case inadmissible – as . it does 400,000 each year – because the claim hinges on a point of fact, . rather than one of law or procedure. Lawyers have criticised the rising influence of unelected judges over British sovereignty. Lord Carlile of Berriew, the . Government's former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said: . 'To have the European Court of Human Rights intervening in judgments of . fact – as opposed to judgments of law – really would be a new departure . and, in my view, a completely unacceptable departure.' If the Government fails to satisfy . judges that MI5 was not complicit in the torture, a full hearing will be . ordered which could force British courts to quash the convictions. The . legal bill will also be footed by the British taxpayer. Amin, 37, was jailed for life in 2007 . for his role in a plot to detonate a fertiliser bomb at Bluewater . shopping centre in Kent, or at London's Ministry of Sound nightclub. MI5 in London: British courts threw out the claim that MI5 were complicit in the torture of two Al-Qaeda terrorists . Documents claim his right to a fair . trial was breached because information against him was 'obtained through . the use of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment'. Ahmed, 37, who was born in Rochdale, . is the highest member of Al Qaeda to go on trial in Britain. Convicted . of 'directing terrorism', he had links with the 7/7 and 21/7 bomb . plotters.

Sue Banwell-Moore had returned from a trip to the Cape Verde islands, off the coast of Western Africa, with a friend when she found the brown 6in (15cm) long Chioninia lizard among her washing . Ms Banwell-Moore said after the initial shock, she realised 'Larry' must have stowed away in her suitcase and travelled all the way back to her house in Churchinford, near Taunton, Somerset . She said she has since grown rather fond of the lizard, . which she has named Larry. 'I got home on the Tuesday and it was snowy in the Blackdown . Hills, and we got back in the early hours of the morning so it wasn't until the . next day when I did a couple of loads of washing that I found him,' she said. 'I put the first lot out and then when I put the second lot . out on to the clothes horse to dry, I looked down and there was this lizard on . the floor. It was just sort of there. 'I did scream, I was just so shocked, I couldn't believe how . it had got there, on my floor, and was wondering if it was going to run all . around the room. 'I phoned my daughter and said ""I've got a lizard on my . floor"", and I was screaming and she was just screaming but with laughter. 'I touched it and it didn't move - it was very cold - and I . thought maybe it was dead.' After covering the lizard with a saucepan for her son to . pick up later, she took a 'little peek' and to her surprise found he had moved. Larry survived a few scrapes on his journey from Cape Verde, left, to Somerset, right . 'I thought ""Oh my God, he's alive"",' Ms Banwell-Moore said. 'My friend was around and he picked him up and held him in . his hand and he stroked him and he sort of came to life. 'We kept him all night in the box and kept the heating up . all night to keep him warm.' Ms Banwell-Moore said she was worried the lizard would not . make it through the night, but in the morning he seemed to be doing well. 'He put his little head up, like he was reacting to my . voice,' she said. 'I was just so pleased that he was doing well.' After the initial shock had passed, Ms Banwell-Moore said she . had fallen in love with Larry after realising just what the reptile had gone . through. Larry has now completed the last part of his journey - 25 miles from Churchinford to the Tropiquaria Wildlife Park in Watchet, Somerset, where he will spend the rest of his days . 'He had been in the hold of the aeroplane, through the . delicate cycle of my washing machine, he went through quite an ordeal, but he . is so sweet. 'I realised what the poor thing had been through, and I sort . of fell in love with him.' She added that while on the island of Sal - one of the most . northerly of the islands off the western coast of Africa - she had only ever . seen one lizard. 'It's very, very barren - beautiful beaches, but has very . little in the way of vegetation or wildlife,' Ms Banwell-Moore said. 'I only ever saw one lizard on the beach and that was the . day before I left and I was watching him and that was that.' Larry has now completed the last part of his journey - 25 . miles from Churchinford to the Tropiquaria Wildlife Park in Watchet, where he . will spend the rest of his days. The keepers at the park have been keeping a close eye on the . lizard after fears the washing powder could have affected his breathing. But the park's director Chris Moiser, who said since taking . over Tropiquaria four years ago he had wanted to move the collection in a . slightly more African direction, said he jumped at the chance of giving Larry a . new home. 'It is very rare - Cape Verde islands is one of those places . with native species found nowhere else in the world, it's so remote,' he said. 'We have it down to one of two species but to tell the . difference between these we need to carefully count some of the small facial . scales, which is rather difficult on a relatively small lizard, which moves at . speed.'","'Larry' the Chioninia lizard is enjoying his new life in Somerset .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . and Daily Mail Reporter . A former nanny for three adopted children Las Vegas police say were subjected to years of abuse and neglect can't understand what took so long for authorities to intervene, saying: 'The system is a disgrace.' Jan Finnegan has slammed the Clark County Department of Family Services following the 23-count indictment of child abuse and neglect charges laid against Dwight Solander, 50, and Janet Solander, 53, the adoptive parents of the three victims involved, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. Danielle Hinton, 21, the daughter of Janet Solander, has also been indicted, with all three adults arrested on March 20 after the children told authorities they were beaten with paint sticks, forced to take cold showers and dry themselves in front of a large fan and regularly prevented from using the bathroom. Adding to the alleged cruelty is the fact that Janet Solander is the author of a book called Foster Care: How to Fix this Corrupted System. The adoptive parents of the three girls, Janet . Solander, 53 (left), and Dwight Solander, 50 (right), face child abuse and neglect charges in a 23-count . indictment after being arrested in Las Vegas on Wednesday . Finnegan said she first reported her concerns about the way the children - aged between nine and 12 - were being to Family Services last year, after being hired to care for the girls in January and February 2013. 'They did nothing for a year,'  Finnegan said Monday. 'They did nothing. The system is a disgrace.' The three sisters were placed in foster care with the Solanders in 2010 and adopted in early 2011. The Solanders also took care of four foster children, who were removed Feb. 27 amid allegations of physical risk, authorities said. After the foster children were removed, Child Protective Services officials learned the three sisters had been sent to a boarding school in Florida. When case workers contacted the girls, they reported persistent abuse and said they feared their mother would kill them if they returned to Las Vegas, the report said. Investigators said the three girls were forced to sleep on boards without sheets, blankets or pillows out of fear they would wet the bed. The girls told authorities their adoptive parents would make them wear their soiled underwear on their head or would stuff them in their mouth if they had an accident, and they made them use catheters. Danielle Hinton, 21, Janet Solander's biological daughter, was also arrrested and has been charged with hitting the victims with a paint stick . Janet Solander imposed harsh punishments if the girls had a bathroom accident, sometimes withholding food from them for three days at a time, the girls told investigators. They also reported their mother doused them with ice water, and one girl had scars that apparently came from her mother pouring hot water on her. The mother also punished them with cold showers, pouring a pitcher of ice water of them and forcing them to dry off with a large fan, police said. Janet Solander's book, which was self-published, is heavy on strict discipline. Ironically, one chapter is called What Happens When You Are Accused of Abuse? The book also describes behavioral issues among foster children. 'The easiest and most defiant way for a child to vent is by urinating or defecating in his or her pants on the bed,' the book says. 'This is where the rage could start for foster parents.' Dwight Solander is accused of participating in the abuse, although he told investigators he only hit the girls with a wooden paint stick on one occasion. Hinton is also accused of hitting the girls with the stick, but she denied the claim in an interview with police. Practice what you preach: Janet Solander was charged with multiple counts of child abuse despite being a published foster care author . In May 2013, the Solanders unsuccessfully attempted to sue Finnegan for slander after the claims she made to Family Services. Finnegan, who replaced a previous nanny, said she at one point even confronted Dwight Solander about the plight of his adopted daughters. 'I tried to talk to him and ask him why they adopted these children,' she said. 'He just got very defensive and said he never had any children and his wife wanted him to have kids.' Finnegan said the Solanders had surveillance cameras throughoyt the home and the children were given a liquid diet. Police reports confirm that detail, noting that the girls had stomach problems because of the way they were treated. Police reports also show that in September 2013 — five months before removing the children — CPS staff snapped a photo of a bucket with a toilet seat on top of it and a photo of a board on the loft floor. The three adopted children were forced to sit on the bucket for hours, and sleep on the board, the police report said. Family Services has not commented on the five-month gap between when the photos were taken and when the children were removed from custody in late February. Finnegan plans to be at the preliminary hearing on April 8. The former nanny plans to be in the courtroom. 'I want to look them in the face,' she said. 'If you adopt a child, you should love a child like it's  your own.'","Dwight Solander, 50, and Janet Solander, 53, are facing a 23-count indictment of child abuse and neglect relating to three girls they fostered and eventually adopted .

"The mother of two children who were living periodically in a 5-by-10-foot unit at a New Jersey storage facility has been sentenced to probation. The 28-year-old Ewing woman received 4 years' probation under an agreement in which she agreed to plead guilty to child abuse and contempt charges. Johnson initially was charged with child endangerment after her sons, then ages 5 and 10, were found in the storage facility last April. Officers checked the facility after she was arrested for slashing her ex-boyfriend's tires. New woman: Johnson, 28, sporting a new look as she appeared in court yesterday, is now trying to regain custody of the sons, said domestic conflict caused her to lose her job and then the roof over her head at a time when she was also dealing with one son's severe ADHD . Last year: Sheena Johnson, 27, at an earlier court appearance was charged with child endangerment after her . young sons were found living in squalor in a storage unit . Johnson thanked the judge for giving her a second chance. Johnson, who is now trying to regain custody of the sons, said domestic conflict caused her to lose her job and then the roof over her head at a time when she was also dealing with one son’s severe ADHD. 'I am encouraged by your decisions and I think they are appropriate,' said Johnson, who appeared before the judge in a black suit with matching hose and heels. Johnson, who benefited from a community fund-raiser after her situation came to light, said she is now working with an agency trying to help other women in desperate situations. Her children remain in foster care. She gets supervised visits with them . and says she plans to regain custody as soon as possible. She was found along with her two young children living in a filthy five-by-ten-foot storage unit in New Jersey. Johnson . told a court last May she was so desperate, she had no other choice but . to move her sons into the sealed container with no running water or . electricity. Sheena Johnson and her two children, five and 10, were living in a 5-by-10-foot unit at a storage facility in New Jersey . The horrific discovery was made last April when Johnson was arrested for allegedly slashing her ex-boyfriend's tires. That's when she confessed to officers that her boys were in the storage unit on their own. Police found the children in deplorable conditions, sleeping on a bare mattress surrounded by garbage bags filled with clothes, a suitcase, a backpack and other items strewn around the locker. Johnson explained to the court she was forced to move into the storage unit after losing her job in December 2012 and breaking up with her fiance due to domestic abuse. She went to live with a relative who later pushed her out of the house and locked the door with her children inside during one argument, she told Mercer County Correction Center. She had to call police to get the door open and she then took the children and their few possessions and went to a hotel. After this, in February 2013, the family had been moving as transients from charity hotel to borrowed beds at friend’s houses, finding places to sleep for a few days at a time. But as money ran low and she was denied more benefits from the county, she said she simply ran out of options. The Homeless Hotline gave the family a room at the Mount’s Motel in Lawrence for three nights. The Extra Space Storage Facility in Ewing, near Trenton, New Jersey, where two boys were found living in a five-foot by ten-foot unit after their mother was arrested . After that, the nights in the storage locker began. 'It really hit me so hard, that I’m down at about the tree-root’s-bottom, and what can I do to make my kids’ life better this way. 'I didn’t see any clarity — our only option was to stay where our stuff is. 'We all hugged and we all slept on the same mattress when we were there. We made it. I didn’t make it seem as if it was the worst situation ever.' She said though it was cold, it wasn't freezing and she heaped blankets over the boys to keep them warm. She would eat in fast-food restaurants for breakfast and the boys would brush their teeth and wash up there. Sometimes they stayed at a friend's house and were able to have showers or watch TV. At the same time she was making sure her boys were going to school. It was over this that she and her ex-fiance argued after she asked him to give the youngest son a ride to school that morning. When he refused, she got angry and slashed his tires. Johnson had left the boys in the storage unit and told them she would be back soon. It was the last time she saw them. She also revealed in court that she has few friends in the area and grew up under drug-addicted parents. She was working by aged 14 and pregnant by 16. The boys, aged five and ten, were reportedly taken for check ups at the Capital Health Regional Medical Center (pictured) before being released in the care of social services . A unit that size at the Ewing location costs up to $70 a month, according to its website. A renter of another unit said he believed the family had been living there 'for months'. There is no heat inside the units and only the hallways are wired for electricity, he said. Flo Auletta, who owns a restaurant across the road from the storage company told the Trentonian that paramedics, code enforcement officials and social workers subsequently arrived on the scene. Ewing Mayor Bert Steinmann told the paper that the discovery had left him 'shocked and appalled' and said he had called the town's two other storage companies to check there was nothing similar occurring. 'I just wished the mother would have sought help instead of going down the route she took,' he added. 'There’s Homefront, the County’s Board of Social Services, Women’s Space — anything would have been better.'","Sheena Johnson given probabtion after her sons were found living alone in 'horrible conditions' in a cramped storage unit after she was arrested .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Guilty: Nichol Marie Phelps, 30, pictured, molested the student during a dance convention in Orlando in March 2012 . A female dance instructor from Cape Coral, Florida, has been convicted of sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl in her class. According to authorities, Nichol Marie Phelps, 30, molested the student during a dance convention in Orlando in March 2012. She was convicted Friday of two counts of lewd and lascivious battery and one count of attempted lewd and lascivious conduct in an Orange County court. In the months prior to the abuse, Phelps had been cultivating an increasingly sexual relationship with the teen, including telling her she was 'hot' and discussing performing sex acts on her. The victim told detectives she met Phelps when she started taking dance classes at the Universal Dance Academy in Port Charlotte at age 13. She said Phelps immediately 'took a liking to her and always singled her out,' according to the Orlando Sentinel. The even after the pupil left the academy, the contact with Phelps continued. According to the Sentinel, police found more than 550 phone calls and text messages between the two from January to June of 2012. The girl told investigators the married Phelps also talked about leaving her husband for her. But the talk turned to action in March 2012 when at a dance convention in Orlando the girl tried to consol Phelps, who was crying in a bathroom. A report obtained by the Sentinel states the instructor had become upset after arguing with a parent of another student. Instructor: The victim told detectives she met Phelps when she started taking dance classes at the Universal Dance Academy, pictured, in Port Charlotte at age 13 . The student said Phelps 'looked at her and asked why she was so hot and why did she have such strong feelings for her.' The woman then pinned her against the wall and kissed her, she said. The following day, when the two were loading equipment into Phelps' car inside the Hyatt garage at Orlando International Airport, the dance teacher told the teen to get into the back seat. She then proceeded to molest her, the police report states. Three months later, Universal Dance Academy fired Phelps after an 'emotional outburst' during a recital, the company's co-owner told police. She was arrested in October 2012 by authorities in Orange County.","Nichol Marie Phelps, from Cape Coral, Florida, was found guilty Friday of two counts of lewd and lascivious battery and one count of attempted lewd and lascivious conduct in an Orange County court .

"By . Joel Christie . Kwasi Enin has a very tough decision to make. On March 27, as tens of thousands of the country's university hopefuls similarly waited patiently at their computers for news - if any - that their applications were successful, the 17-year-old from Long Island, who had already been accepted early into Princeton, got into Brown. And then Columbia. And then Cornell, Yale and Dartmouth, too. 'I was like - this can't be happening!' Kwasi told Newsday. Scroll down for video . Now that's high achievement: Kwasi Enin, 17 a senior at William Floyd High School in Shirley, New York, applied to all eight Ivy League Universities - and was accepted by the lot . Harvard University - a private Ivy League research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts - has an acceptance rate of only 5.9 per cent, meaning only 2,023 of the 34,295 applicants will get in. They accepted Kwasi Enin . By 5pm, he had six Ivy League colleges offering him a place at their institutions, and then the toughest of them all, Harvard, sent the William Floyd High School student an email. The university has an acceptance rate of only 5.9 per cent - meaning only 2,023 of the 34,295 applicants will get in - and they wanted Kwasi. Cornell, similiarly, accepted only 14 per cent. So what makes Kwasi so desirable as a freshman? With an SAT score of 2,250 out of 2,400 - which places him in the 99th percentile for all students taking the exam - as a competitive shot putter he is also a star athlete. He also sings and plays viola for the school orchestra. Kwasi is a first generation American from Ghana. His parents, both nurses, moved to New York in the 1980s. His father, Ebenezer Enin, said Kwasi - who wants to study medicine - was raised to strive for excellence. 'He's an amazing kid. He's very humble.,' Mr Enin said. 'He's been trained to be a high achiever right from when he was a kid. 'We have been encouraging him to be an all-around student. So far, he has proved himself.' Kwasi Enin matriculated at William Floyd High School, a large school on Long Island, New York. His principal said that, from the start, it was clear he would succeed . According to USA Today, Kwasi's feat is extremely rare, with few students even able to apply to all eight Ivy Leagues, because each seeks different qualities in their students. 'My heart skipped a beat when he told me he was applying to all eight' says Nancy Winkler, the guidance counselor at William Floyd. In 29 years as a counselor, she says, she's never seen anything like this. 'It's a big deal when we have students apply to one or two Ivies. To get into one or two is huge. It was extraordinary.' Kwasi's success is the third big college announcement highlighting Black male excellence in recent weeks. Another success story: Avery Coffey, 17, a senior at D.C.'s prestigious Benjamin Banneker Academic High School, applied to five Ivy League schools and was accepted to all of them.

A New York-based Australian playboy is accused of embezzling over $7 million from his own mining company to fund ‘a high-class lifestyle for himself and his girlfriends,’ including private jets, a luxury yacht and a $171,000 Tiffany engagement ring for his Brazilian fiancée, a new lawsuit claims. Aaron Thomas, 26, was sacked as CEO of London-based Oakmont Trading Ltd earlier this year after the board accused him of squandering millions of company money to fund his extravagant lifestyle, according to a lawsuit filed by the company in the Manhattan Supreme Court on Monday. Thomas founded the company, which owns and operates a Brazilian iron ore mine, in 2010 and then proceeded to sell 74 percent of the company’s stock to investors, the suit states. Aaron Thomas is accused of embezzling over $7 million from London-based Oakmont Trading Ltd to fund 'a high-class lifestyle for himself and his girlfriends,' including private jets, a luxury yacht and $120,000-worth of designer watches . But Thomas’ playboy lifestyle, including paying $14,500 a month for a Manhattan apartment where he lived with his fiancée Thaiana Rodrigues, got the better of him and the company has launched legal action in both the UK and the US to recover an estimated $7m of company money. ‘While Thomas has made some disclosures as to the whereabouts of the misappropriated funds, a sum of around [$2.5 million] remains unaccounted for,’ the suit states. The lawsuit features numerous examples of Thomas’ decadent spending, reports the New York Post. He is alleged to have spent $91,000 of company funds on a trip to Las Vegas in May 2013. Another $121,500 was apparently spent on designer watches by Rolex, and Hubot, and he even paid for ‘many other flights taken by Thomas’s girlfriends, including Rodrigues, in 2012 and 2013,’ the suit states. Thomas is alleged to have spent $91,000 of company funds on a trip to Las Vegas in May 2013 .

"By . Joshua Gardner . A Connecticut woman who didn’t know she was pregnant gave birth to a baby boy weighing over nine pounds in her home’s driveway on Saturday. Jennifer Scollin of Seymour says she was feeling fine up until a few days before the birth, but even then she believed it was just stress at work or a bad stomach bug. She soon discovered the truth when her water broke and the baby came so fast that paramedics at the scene didn’t even have time to leave their parking place.

When she woke up Saturday in serious pain, she called Dillman and he rushed over from his nearby job. 'He was going to drive me to the hospital, but we had no chance to do that,' Scollin said. 'We didn't know at first it was a baby coming, but once we did, it happened fast.' They called 911 when they realized what was happening. Once the paramedics arrived, her labor was almost over. According to the CT Post, Scollin could barely walk out to their ambulance. The baby would arrive before it could even pull away. 'Two pushes and he was out,' she said. Cole Michael Thomas Dillman was born a healthy 9lbs, 3oz. The couple went to an area hospital, where Scollin remained for observation. Dillman called Scollin's parents Tom and Joanne as he returned home. 'We arrived minutes after the birth,' Tom Scollin told CT Post. 'I was alarmed, shocked to be told by my granddaughter that her mom had a baby boy.' The shock subsided with time and a little explanation from the equally surprised mom. 'My daughter said, ""Dad, I didn't know,""' he said. As many proud parents do, Dillman and Scollin proudly posted pictures of their new arrival on social media, where reactions weren't your 'congratulations.'

The FBI revealed on Tuesday it is investigating whether 'high-speed trading' companies, which use ultra-fast computers and complex algorithms to complete transactions, are guilty of insider trading.

The FBI investigation launched a year ago targets high-speed trading companies on Wall Street (Stock Image) The agency said its probe, called the . 'High-Speed Trading Initiative,' was launched about one year ago and is . still in the early stages, FBI officials told the Wall Street Journal.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Ronan Farrow has been a big success at nearly everything in his life so far, but ratings for his MSNBC talk show are apparently so bad that he is facing the possibility of being axed just a month after launch. Mia Farrow’s 26-year-old son was handed his own TV show, Ronan Farrow Daily, which premiered in late February in a blaze of publicity. Despite little prior experience, MSNBC had high hopes that Farrow will help them attract millennial viewers, something which hasn’t happened so far. Scroll down for video . Ratings for Ronan Farrow's MSNBC talk show are apparently so bad that he is facing the possibility of being axed just a month after launch . ‘He sort of stinks on TV,’ an MSNBC source told the Daily News. ‘He hasn’t turned out to be the superstar they were hoping for.’ The news network had hoped that Farrow, a Rhodes scholar who graduated college when he was 15 and went on to graduate from Yale and Oxford, would bring his 245,000 Twitter followers with him to television. ‘But that hasn’t happened,’ the source said. ‘Just because someone is a boy genius-turned-Twitter star doesn’t mean they deserve their own TV show.’ Last Wednesday, Farrow drew an average of about 312,000 total viewers and was 708th among all programming ranked by Nielsen, in both total viewers and the 18-to-49 age group advertisers covet. Things looked more positive in February for Farrow when he coveted a converted journalism award . Embarassingly it was beaten by the likes of an 8 a.m. repeat of Golden Girls on the Hallmark Channel. Farrow, who worked for the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Obama administration, has looked uncomfortable on camera and often stumbles over his words. MSNBC moved quickly to issue a denial: ‘This is simply not true. We’re happy with the debut of Ronan Farrow Daily and the show’s progress this first month. MSNBC will continue to support Ronan and his team as they develop and grow the program.’ But on his Twitter feed, Ronan appeared to be addressing his ratings slum when he recently tweeted: 'Waking up to another crushing day of not being Oprah.’ It was all so different back in February when he received a prestigious journalism award after a grand total of three hours of daytime television. Despite little prior experience, MSNBC had high hopes that Farrow will help them attract millennial viewers, something which hasn't happened so far . Farrow was handed The Cronkite Award for Excellence in Exploration and Journalism at a ceremony in New York. The honor is named for renowned American journalist Walter Cronkite, who presented the first award in 1984.

"By . James  Nye . A 51-year-old mother-of-five from Florida died when her Brazilian buttocks lift surgery went wrong having only gone through with the operation because a down-payment of $4,000 was non-refundable. Naples resident Maribel Cardona, died shortly after augmentation surgery performed at Vanity Cosmetic Center in Miami in July, according to the results of an autopsy published on Monday. Tragically, Cardona tried to cancel the procedure because of the risks involved but suffered cardiac arrest following a pulmonary embolism which developed shortly after her plastic surgery. Scroll down for video . Cosmetic: This Vanity Cosmetic Center in Miami - where 51-year-old Maribel Cardona died in July after complications arose following her Brazilian buttocks surgery . Brazilian buttock implants involve transfer of fat from one part of the body to another and embolisms are a risk when the tube used to boost the posterior pierces blood vessels, inserting fat particles into the bloodstream. Doctor: Anthony Hasan performed the surgery - he is a qualified dermatologist - although in Florida any registered medical professional can perform cosmetic surgery . Cardona's neighbor, Amy Spinelli, said that the mother learned of the clinic through a friend and wanted to go there because it was inexpensive. However, Spinelli said that Cardona's son was set-against the surgery and managed to persuade her to cancel it. But according to Cardona's son, the clinic said that the down payment of $4,000 for the surgery was not going to be returned to the Walmart cashier - so she went ahead with the surgery. The operation was performed by Anthony Hasan, who told the Miami Herald that approximately five minutes after the operation in July, he was told by the anesthesiologist that Cardona was conscious but her oxygen and blood pressure was too low. She did not respond to the treatment she was given for this and was taken to Kendal Regional Medical Center, where she passed away from a lung embolism, or blockage, caused by fatty tissue. Onelio Garcia, a professor at the University of Miami, certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery with 30-years experience, said that this should not have happened. Indeed, while Hasan is not certified as a plastic surgeon and is actually a dermatologist - in Florida it is legal for any doctor, regardless of their speciality to perform cosmetic surgery. Popular: Brazilian buttock lifts have grown in popularity in recent years - and Florida is one of the leading centers for the surgery . Hasan's online biography at Vanity says that he is a specialist in breast augmentation surgery, in addition to liposuction and tummy tucks. There does not appear to be any mention of buttock lifting expertise. The Miami doctor has said that Cardona is his first serious incident ever with a patient and that he has been operating on patients since 1999. In 2007, Hasan was sued for malpractice and reached a settlement with the patient. In addition to this, Hasan was on probation in July when he performed the surgery and had to be under the indirect supervision of a doctor. This was because he pleaded guilty to conspiring and cooperating to commit fraud and giving out a prescription medication,Viagra, with labels containing false information. Tragedy: Maribel Cardona passed away at the Kendall Regional Medical Center from a lung embolism . 'Those charges have nothing to do with the practice of surgery,' Hasan said in July. 'I lent my name to someone I trusted and he abused it.' Hasan said he does not have malpractice insurance due to its cost, he said. 'Like 95 percent of plastic surgeons.' 'I checked everything that had to be checked and, honestly, I don’t believe I could have done anything different,' the doctor said of Cardona’s surgery. Maribel Cardona is not the only patient who has had a medical emergency following buttock implant surgery at the Vanity center. In November, Linda Escanaverino was hospitalized for four days and needed a blood transfusion following her operation.","Maribel Cardona, 51, died of a lung embolism after surgery at the Vanity Cosmetic Center in Miami in July .

"By . Ashley Collman . The grieving families of the victims of the Washington mudslide need government funds to pay for funerals for their loved ones, Governor Jay Inslee said on Monday as he petitioned President Obama for more disaster relief. The deadly mudslide that swept way a rural community in Oso on March 22 - killing at least 24 people and destroying 30 homes - caused $10million in damage, the governor reported. President Obama previously declared the mudslide a federal emergency, but Inslee is now hoping to secure a major disaster declaration which will grant financial assistance to the community displaced by the natural disaster. Grief: Residents of Darrington pray during a church service at Saint John Mary Vianney Catholic Church. The Washington governor is petitioning the government for funds so families can afford funerals . Heartbroken: Oso fire department firefighter Mark Upthegrove, left, weeps after a moment of silence for those lost in the mudsilde on Saturday, while a weary searcher, right, bows his head at the site on Sunday . Inslee says 30 families need assistance with housing, personal and household goods after the slide destroyed $7million in structures and another $3million in contents. The request also seeks federal help to cover funeral expenses and mental health care programs for survivors, volunteers, community members and first responders on the scene. Meanwhile rescue teams, including . National Guard units back from Afghanistan, went into their ninth day . searching for remains in the half-square mile of muck. The remains of three bodies were . pulled from the mud on Monday, but they haven't been added to the death . toll yet as the medical examiner tries to identify the remains. Swept away: A mudslide ripped through the town of Oso, Washington on March 22 and rescuers continue to search for the more than a dozen still missing. The cliff that collapsed in the slide pictured above on Monday . Wading through the mud: Monday was dry and sunny which aided in the search. Remains of three bodies were pulled from the muck yesterday but haven't been added to the official death toll yet .

Above, a man digs through the mud by hand on Monday . Help us: Gov Inslee wants funding to help provide housing and other services to victims of the slide. Pictured speaking at a press conference on Sunday above . The death toll raised to 24 yesterday, up from 21 the day before. So far, 18 of the 24 remains have been identified by the medical examiners. Meanwhile, the list of missing has been narrowed down to 22 from 30. 'There's been an exhaustive effort by the detectives to narrow the list down to one that they feel comfortable releasing,' Snohomish county executive director Gary Haakenson said. 'These are 22 people whose loved ones . are grieving,' he said. 'We want to do all we can to find them and put . some closure in place for their families.' Complicating the process is the fact the bodies aren't always found in tact. Recovery team supervisor Steve Harris . said the force of the landslide was so strong that whole cars were . 'compacted down to about the size of a refrigerator, just smashed to the . point where you can hardly tell it was a vehicle.' In perspective: The slide site viewed from above . Lost forever? Authorities say they may never be able to find all of the missing trapped under the 60-80 feet of mud. The rescue effort pictured above on March 30 . Protection: Rescuers have been duct-taping their boots to their trousers to stop contamination from the toxic waste mixed in with the mud . No one has been pulled out of the mud alive since the day of the slide, when eight injured were rescued from the mud. Dog teams have been helping the rescuers but were given a break on Sunday due to exhaustion. Authorities say it may be impossible to account for everyone lost in the disaster. The decision to call off the search will be made by the joint incident command but a spokesman for Gov Inslee says 'there's a lot of work to be done yet'. But a sunny day Monday and forecasted dry whether should help the rescue process as teams can focus on searching instead of pumping water out of the mud field. This drying trend 'will help crews and rescue the risk of flooding and additional slides,' the county said in a statement. But even with the drying trend, officials are scared about the toxic contaminants that could spread disease into the local community. Helper: Rescue dog Tryon, muddied from the day's work, stands with his handler near the west side of the mudslide on Highway 530 near mile marker 37  in Arlington, Washington, on Sunday, March 30, 2014 . Wreckage: Assorted broken debris sits on a muddy suitcase pulled from the scene on Sunday . Officials say that sewage, propane, household solvents and other chemicals are mixed in with the muck, and rescuers have been taping their boots to their trousers to ward off exposure. 'We're worried about dysentery. We're worried about tetanus. We're worried about contamination,' local fire Lieutenant Richard Burke, a spokesman for the operation, told reporters visiting the disaster site. 'The last thing we want to do is take any of these contaminants out of here and take them into town, back to our families.' 'This is going to be a hazardous materials site for many years while we try to get this cleaned up,' Burke said. While rescuers continued to search through the mud on Monday for remains buried 60 to 80 feet below, some 300 gathered at the local Darrington Community Center to be cheered up with a visit from members of the Super Bowl-winning Seattle Seahawks and the city's Major League Soccer team, the Sounders.

"By . Ryan Gorman . A Texas mother claims she was hospitalized Saturday after finding a rancid mystery object inside a can of V8 Fusion that smelled and tasted ‘horrible.’ Crystal Rodriguez, 27, of Mercedes, says the smell and taste of the juice became unbearable, causing her to empty it and cut open the can to see what was rattling inside when she shook it – she found a shriveled up mystery object. Rodriguez told KGBT she became so sick the next day she had to go to a local hospital, doctors told her she was poisoned. Write caption here . ‘I opened it and when I took a drink out of it I spit it out because it tasted horrible,’ she told the station. The Texas mother has a V8 Fusion every single night, so do her children, but this is the first time she has had any issue with her favorite drink. The rancid smell and taste caused her to pour the juice out and what should have been an empty can rattled with a strange object when she shook it, she said. The concerned woman cut the can open and made the startling find. ‘[It] looks like a pork, the skin pork’s, just nastier,’ she recalled. ‘The bottom of it had like black, it looks like it has little eyes and a little mouth.’ Rodriguez spent the night tossing and turning in bed with an increasingly upset stomach until the pain became too much to handle, the nausea overpowering. Horrible: Rodriguez claims this rancid object led to her bacterial infection . Not expired: She said the juice smelled and tasted rancid despite the expiration date not having passed . Her favorite drink: The mother of five says she and her children drink V8 Fusion every day . ‘I just feel nauseous and my stomach grumbling,’ she said. ‘I hadn't really been able to eat any breakfast or anything for the same reason that I just want to vomit.’ Doctors told her she had a bacterial infection in her stomach, said Rodriguez, and she blames the tainted V8. They were befuddled by what she found in the can. Rodriguez said she contacted Campbell’s, the drink’s maker, and was told to mail in the bizarre find, and a Campbell's spokesperson told MailOnline a courier was dispatched to pick it up. The spokesperson also said no other similar cases have been reported, and that no other sicknesses have been blamed on the juice. The sickened woman doesn’t want anything from the company – not money or even a replacement for the drink. She just wants to know what was in her juice. The Campbell's spokesperson said testing on the object will determine what action is taken next.","The juice was not expired but smelled and tasted rancid, and Crystal Rodriguez claims it gave her a bacterial infection .

"By . Associated Press . In every region of America, white and Asian children are far better positioned for success than black, Latino and American Indian children, according to a new report appealing for urgent action to bridge this racial gap. Titled 'Race for Results,' the report is being released on Tuesday by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, which for decades has worked to improve child well-being in the United States. The foundation also produces annual 'Kids Count' reports, with reams of state-specific data, but these generally have not focused on race. The new report tackles the topic head-on, with charts and ratings that convey dramatic racial discrepancies. The report described the challenges facing black children as 'a national crisis' (Stock Image) At the core of the report is a newly devised index based on 12 indicators measuring a child's success from birth to adulthood. The indicators include reading and math proficiency, high school graduation data, teen birthrates, employment prospects, family income and education levels, and neighborhood poverty levels. Using a single composite score with a scale of one to 1,000, Asian children have the highest index score at 776, followed by white children at 704. 'Scores for Latino (404), American-Indian (387) and African-American (345) children are distressingly lower, and this pattern holds true in nearly every state,' said the report. African American students are the least likely to succeed, the study found . Patrick McCarthy, the Casey Foundation's president, said the findings are 'a call to action that requires serious and sustained attention from the private, nonprofit, philanthropic and government sectors to create equitable opportunities for children of color.' The report was based on data from 2012, including census figures tallying the number of U.S. children under 18 at 39 million whites, 17.6 million Latinos, 10.2 million blacks, 3.4 million of Asian descent, and 640,000 American Indians, as well as about 2.8 million children of two or more races. Under census definitions, Latinos can be of various racial groups. The report described the challenges facing African-American children as 'a national crisis.' For black children, the states with . the lowest scores were in the South and upper Midwest — with Wisconsin . at the bottom, followed closely by Mississippi and Michigan. The highest . scores were in states with relatively small black populations — Hawaii, . New Hampshire, Utah and Alaska. Outcomes varied for different . subgroups of Asian and Latino children. For example, in terms of family . income levels, children of Southeast Asian descent — Burmese, Hmong, . Laotian, Cambodian and Vietnamese — faced greater hurdles than children . whose families came from India, Japan, the Philippines and China. Among . Latinos, children of Mexican and Central American descent faced the . biggest barriers to success; those of Cuban and South American descent . fared better in the index. The state with the highest score for Latino children was Alaska, at 573. The lowest was Alabama, at 331. Only 25 states provided enough data to . compile scores for American Indian children. Their scores were highest . in Texas (631), Alabama (568), Florida (554) and Kansas (553), and . lowest in the upper Midwest, the Southwest and the Mountain States. The . score for Indian children in South Dakota — 185 — was the lowest of any . group in any state on the index. Some of South Dakota's Indian reservations are among the poorest nationwide, which contributes to high levels of domestic violence, alcoholism and drug abuse, fetal-alcohol syndrome, teen pregnancy and low graduation rates. The report found sharp differences in Indian children's outcomes based on tribal affiliation. For example, Apache children were far more likely than Choctaw children to live in economically struggling families. Among its recommendations, the report urged concerted efforts to collect and analyze race-specific data on child well-being that could be used to develop programs capable of bridging the racial gap. It said special emphasis should be placed on expanding job opportunities as children in the disadvantaged groups enter adulthood. 'Regardless of our own racial background or socio-economic position, we are inextricably interconnected as a society,' the report concluded. 'We must view all children in America as our own — and as key contributors to our nation's future.' The study created its own 1,000 point scoring system. Asian children scored the highest, followed by white, Latino, American Indian and African American .","A new report says Asian and white children in the U.S. are better positioned for success than Latino, American Indian and black children .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Two brothers today admitted their part in a £1.5million smash-and-grab raid on Selfridges in London by a gang masquerading as burka-wearing women. Sam Curtin, 24, and Connor Groake, 19, were members of a six-strong group who mingled with shoppers before smashing open display cabinets in the evening attack at the department store. They snatched 42 luxury watches before attempting to make their escape on a stolen moped, but were arrested after crashing the vehicle and being held by members of the public. Facing jail: Sam Curtin, left, 24, and his half brother Connor Groake, right, 19, were part of a six-strong group who mingled with shoppers before smashing open display cabinets in the raid at the Selfridges in London . Both pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit a robbery and aggravated vehicle taking - which relates to the moped they used in the raid - at Kingston Crown Court today. Police believe an estimated £1.5million worth of luxury goods were taken in the raid. In total, around 140 watches were stolen, made by designer brands including Hublot, Jaeger Le Coultre, Dreyfuss, Zenith, U-Boat, Raymond Weil, Blancpain, Frederique Constant, Burberry, Bremont, Baume & Mercier and Audemars Piguet. Forty-two of the stolen watches were recovered with their tags on in a holdall. However, a further £1million worth of watches are yet to be recovered. At an earlier hearing, the court heard how Curtin was trying to make his getaway with Groake, his half brother, on the scooter when it crashed on Charlotte Street, in central London's West End shopping district. After being stopped from running away by members of the public, he was detained by police officers. He was taken to hospital with a fractured leg and hobbled into court today on crutches, wearing a grey t-shirt and grey jogging bottoms. The court heard Groake, who was dressed in a blue t-shirt and jogging bottoms today, was riding the Vespa moped at the time of the crash and escaped uninjured, but was also stopped from escaping by passers-by. The rest of the gang remain at large. At today's hearing, Judge Nicholas Price QC said the incident was a 'matter of grave importance and seriousness'. Selfridge's robber Sam Curtin's broken leg is not being looked after properly in jail and has begun to smell bad, his lawyer claimed today. Gordon Johnston, representing Curtin, told the court how his client’s injuries were getting worse because of the lack of treatment he was getting at Wandsworth Prison. He said: 'The hospital has complained that he is not being treated in the way they expect and have warned that if his leg is not allowed to heal correctly it may have to be broken again. 'The wound smells and it needs attention.' Judge Price said: 'I am astonished to hear that if the hospital have required him to attend why he hasn’t done so. 'If he needs treatment and needs it urgently it must be done.' Members of the gang wore burkas - the full body cloak worn by some Muslim women to hide their bodies in public - to disguise themselves and the tools they were carrying as they mingled with customers at Selfridges on June 6, police said. The axe and sledge hammer-wielding raiders waited for an apparently pre-arranged moment to smash glass cabinets then filled their holdalls with the watches. They then fled using getaway vehicles including a moped, two motorbikes and a black BMW estate. But moments later Curtin and Groake crashed in Charlotte Street, at junction with Goodge Street. Police revealed the two motorbikes used in the robbery were later recovered by officers in Bolton Place, near the junction with Taunton Place, in Marylebone. The suspects were seen to run off in the direction of Russmore Road, where another vehicle may have been waiting. The black BMW was found in Cumberland Gardens, central London, the following day. At Curtin’s first appearance at Lavender Hill Magistrates’ Court in south London, Christian Wheeliker, prosecuting, said: 'This defendant was part of the Selfridges watch robbery where approximately £1.5million of watches were stolen by a gang of around 10 males. 'Six of them went into Selfridges wearing Burkas and produced axes and sledgehammers and smashed open the watch cabinets causing great fear to everyone else around, because this was a couple of days after the Woolwich incident and because of the get-up and the particular manner.' Devious: Members of the gang wore burkas - the full body cloak worn by some Muslim women - to disguise themselves and their tools as they mingled with customers at Selfridges on June 6, police said . Aftermath: The raiders waited for an apparently pre-arranged moment to smash the glass cabinets, fill their holdalls with the watches then flee in vehicles including a moped, two motorbikes and a black BMW estate . Detectives from the Met’s Flying Squad are still hunting the outstanding suspects and asking anyone who may have any information to come forward. They are also appealing to anyone who may have been offered one of the watches to get in contact with them. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Noyes, from the Flying Squad, said: 'The robbery took place whilst the store was full with shoppers and we still want to hear from anyone who was in or around Selfridges on Thursday June 6th who witnessed the robbery, or may have seen the men in the time running up to the robbery or as they made their escape. 'This robbery will have taken planning and preparation and there may be people who think they know who was responsible, police need to hear from them. 'Likewise I would urge anyone who took photos or video footage whilst the robbery was in progress or when the six fled the store to send them to us as this could greatly assist us with our investigation. 'It is also important that we hear from anyone who has been approached to buy a luxury watch to also get in contact.' Curtin and Groake, both from Islington, north London, will be sentenced later this month.","Sam Curtin and Connor Groake crashed as they tried to make their getaway .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Too young: Yuri Hirayama, 16, was killed in a fiery car crash along with his parents while traveling toward the Grand Canyon for a spring break vacation . A 16-year-old boy and his parents have been killed in a fiery car wreck involving a police pursuit in Arizona, which also left a little girl clinging to life. Stevenson High School sophomore Yuri Hirayama, his 9-year-old sister, Rinka, and their parents, Tomohiro and Sachiyo Hirayama, were driving from their home in Vernon Hills, Illinois, toward the Grand Canyon Friday evening when their spring break vacation came to an abrupt and tragic end. Police said just after 9pm, the family's 2014 black Chrysler van was struck by a maroon Ford pickup truck, which was being chased by the Navajo police Department along U.S. Route 160 west of Tuba City, Arizona. The vehicle carrying two people crossed the median on a two-lane road and struck the Hirayama's' van head-on. Arizona Department of Public Safety spokesman Raul Garcia said police went in pursuit of the pickup after it was spotted driving erratically in Tuba City 25 miles away, according to Chicago Tribune. At the time of the crash, the officers' vehicle was more than a mile behind due to traffic congestion. The collision caused the Ford pickup to burst into flames, killing its two occupants, who were not immediately named. The crash also killed three members of the Hirayama family on the spot. Nine-year-old Rinka survived the impact and was taken to a Phoenix hospital in critical condition. The child's grandparents are expected to fly in from Japan this week to be with her since the Hirayamas had no other relatives in the U.S, reported the Daily Herald. The family, who were originally from Japan, arrived in the U.S. from Holland last summer when Mr Hirayama, 50, accepted a job in the Vernon Hills area. New in town: Yuri enrolled in Stevenson High School in Lincolnshire, Illinois, at the beginning of the current school year a few months after his family arrived from Holland . Yuri Hirayama, 16, enrolled in Stevenson High School in Lincolnshire at the beginning of the current school year, becoming a member of the fencing program and a club for transfer students. The teenager was not fluent in English and was taking classes in the English Language Learning Program, according to school officials. ‘The recollections of Yuki were that he was a happy boy with a great disposition. Everyone was just getting to know him a little bit,’ school spokesman Jim Conrey told NBC Chicago. Yuri’s sister, Rinka, is a third-grader at Half Day School in Lincolnshire.","Tomohiro and Sachiyo Hirayama, and their son, Yuri, were killed on trip to Grand Canyon .

"By . Beth Stebner . The driver of a Maserati who was killed in a drive-by shooting on the Las Vegas strip on Thursday bragged about stashing a gun in his $120,000 Italian sports car. Kenneth Cherry, aka Kenny Clutch, was killed when men inside a black Range Rover opened fire on his car while he was sitting at a red light. He accelerated into the intersection and crashed into a taxi. Cab driver Michael Boldon and his passenger died when the taxi burst into flames. Family members said Boldon had recently moved to Las Vegas to take care of his ailing mother. Police say the shooting was the result of a fight that erupted in the nearby Aria Resort and Casino that escalated into violence. Scroll down for video .

Gunned down: Rapper Kenneth Cherry, aka Kenny Clutch, was killed in a drive-by shooting on the Las Vegas strip on Thursday . Law enforcement personnel investigate the scene of the mulit-vehicle accident on Las Vegas Boulevard . Despite initial reports that the chaos on the Strip was the result of a gunfight, authorities are now saying neither Cherry nor his passenger fired any shots and that the attack was a drive-by shooting. The gunmen, driving a Range Rover with black rims, tinted windows and a temporary paper license plate, are still at large. The shooting took place just two blocks from the spot where rapper Tupac Shakur was infamously gunned down in a drive-by shooting in 1992 on the Las Vegas Strip. Innocent: Cab driver Michael Boldon was killed along with his passenger when the Maserati slammed into his taxi . Cherry was only beginning his rap career when he was killed. He posted two videos on YouTube last year and each had gained only a few thousand views. In 'Stay Schemin,' he rapped about hiding a pistol in his Maserati. Police have no said whether Cherry was armed the night of the shooting. 'Maserati. Paid 120 for it. Stash box 'cuz you know I got that semi for it,' he sings. The gunfire broke about about 4:20am PST when at least one person in the Range Rover opened fire. Several people were inside the vehicle, according to police. Cherry's Maserati sped through the intersection and crashing into a taxi cab, which burst into flames. The driver of the Maserati, as well as the taxi driver and a passenger in the cab were killed in the fiery crash, police said. One witness said it was like a scene out of 'Die Hard.' Now authorities are trying to track down . the gunman, who remains at large after fleeing the scene. Officials say . the shooter remains armed and dangerous. In . a press conference this morning, Las Vegas Police Sgt. John Sheahan . said the attack was not a rolling gun battle as previously described, . saying that the cars were all stopped at a red light. Sgt. Sheahan said police have video from traffic cameras at the intersection where the shooting occurred on Thursday. At the scene: The taxi exploded during the pileup in Vegas . Fireball: Smoke and flames billow from the burning taxi cab at the intersection of Flamingo Dr and Las Vegas Boulevard . Charred: The charred wreckage of cars is seen this morning on Las Vegas Boulevard and Flamingo Avenue as police investigate Thursday morning's deadly events . The entire section of the Las Vegas Strip was roped off by police this morning as they continue their investigation . 'We have a lot of pieces to put together to establish a timeline as to why this confrontation occurred,' he said. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports that the high-speed gun battle could have started as a dispute at a nearby casino. LVMPD officials are still searching for the gunman and the high-end SUV after it fled the scene of the deadly accident. They said the SUV has black rims and tinted windows. The identities of the three victims have not yet been released, though it was revealed that the driver of the Maserati was male. Las Vegas Metro Police Capt. Chis Jones briefs reporters after the shooting; victims' identities have not yet been released . Crime scene: A crime scene analyst photographs a car in front of Caesars Palace hotel-casino . Las Vegas Metro officers investigate the site of the fatal shooting in an elaborate crime scene . Three other vehicles were involved in . the wreck, but Sgt John Sheahan said the SUV was gone before police arrived. Officer Jose Hernandez told MailOnline that police are now trying to locate the high-end SUV. ‘It has dealership-like paper plates on it, believed to be occupied by several black males,’ he said. ‘They are considered armed and dangerous.’ Tourists staying in high-rise hotels around the scene found police tape blocking access to the area around the intersection. Closures were expected to last most of the day, snarling traffic in the highly-popular tourist corridor. British tourist Mark Thompson, who was visiting from Manchester said that the scene was something straight out of an action movie. 'This doesn't happen where we come from, not on this scale,' he said. 'We get stabbings, and gang violence, but this is like something out of a movie. Like ""Die Hard"" or something.' Strip: Authorities say Harris shot at Cherry's Maserati from inside his black  Range Rover . Early reports stated that passengers in the Maserati exchanged gunfire with those in the Range Rover, but the information was later proved erroneous. The Maserati slammed into the taxi at the intersection of Flamingo and Las Vegas boulevards, causing the taxi burst into flames. At least three people were hospitalized, including a passenger from the Maserati. Police said that one of the Maserati passengers is being treated at a local hospital for gunshot wounds. LVMP spokesman Jose Hernandez said that at least two other people in the other crashed vehicles are being treated for moderate injuries. Mr Hernandez said that police are looking into the cause of the shooting. A tourist who witnessed the aftermath of the crash told KLAS-TV the burning taxi looked like a fireball. 'There was a loud bang, and I hear two other booms. I looked out my window at Caesars Palace...and could see the fireball,' he told the CNN affiliate.

"By . Jill Reilly . Los Angeles Angels hitting coach Don Baylor broke his right leg in a freak accident while catching Vladimir Guerrero's ceremonial first pitch Monday night. The 64-year-old squatted to catch Guerrero's off-target throw but as he moved his right leg bent back awkwardly and he couldn't move. Two team employees helped Baylor to the dugout, leaving the Angels in disbelief on the field at Angel Stadium. Baylor is a survivor of multiple myeloma, a cancer that attacks bone marrow and can increase the chance that the bones will break or fracture. Scroll down for video . Los Angeles Angels hitting coach Don Baylor broke his right leg in a freak accident while catching Vladimir Guerrero's ceremonial first pitch Monday night . Baylor, who joined the Angels' coaching staff in the offseason, had to be helped off the field. He was taken to a hospital and is scheduled to have surgery tonight on his right femur. The accident happened before the Angels' 10-3 loss to the Seattle Mariners. The 64-year-old squatted to catch Guerrero's Vladimir Guerrero's ceremonial first pitch Monday night . His right leg bent back awkwardly and he couldn't move as he made the catch . 'Our thoughts and prayers are with Don right now,' Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. 'Obviously it's a freak (injury). We'll see how it turns out.' 'It got me sick when I was warming up and hearing what happened in the dugout,' said Mike Trout, who hit a two-run homer in the first inning. Baylor was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2003, and he is active in fundraising efforts to combat the disease. The cancer can weaken bones all over and increase the chance that the bones will break or fracture, sometimes breaking from just a minor stress or injury. Two team employees helped Baylor to the dugout, leaving the Angels in disbelief on the field at Angel Stadium . The former manager of the Rockies and Cubs, he left the Arizona Diamondbacks in the offseason to return to Anaheim, where he played six seasons with the California Angels. He replaced Jim Eppard as the Angels' hitting coach last October. Los Angeles also hired assistant hitting coach Dave Hansen, who was the Mariners' hitting coach last season. Baylor and Guerrero are the only AL MVPs in Angels franchise history. Baylor won the award in 1979 during arguably the best season of his 19-year major league career with seven teams. Guerrero threw the ceremonial first pitch to celebrate his retirement with the Angels on a one-day contract.","The 64-year-old squatted to catch Guerrero's off-target throw .

"By . Joshua Gardner . A family brawl that broke out between neighbors in Oak Hill, Florida on Sunday ended with one man being bitten not just by a pit bull, but also by the dog's owner. Volusia County sheriffs say that Peter Lynch and his wife Kelly were on one side of the scuffle with their 60-year-old neighbor John Hendry, his daughter Jessica and their 1-year-old pit bull Ellie May on the other. By the end of it, the women were at each others throats down on the ground and both Mr. Hendry and Ellie May had sunk their teeth into Mr. Lynch's flesh. According to the News-Journal Online, it all began with the dog. Write caption here . Mr. Lynch, 52, claimed to police he was out playing basketball with his sons when the ball was stuck in a tree at the edge of the Hendry's property. When the boys went to retrieve it, they say Ellie May appeared and came charging at them aggressively. Mr. Lynch then kicked the canine and told the boys to run away. Responding to what she said were Ellie May's screams, Jessica Hendry, 29, approached Lynch and told him to back off her dog. Just when they fight: Hendry maintained to police that Ellie May was a good girl who only bit Lynch whenever the two neighbors fought (FILE PHOTO) According to the blow-by-blow police report, Hendry then struck Lynch in the head. As Lynch shoved the woman to the ground, two things happened: John Hendry emerged to defend his daughter and Kelly Lynch, 44, came from her home to come to her husband's aid. Mutual injuries described by police . indicate that the women scratched at one another and wrestled on the . ground as the two men came to blows, as well. Ellie May stood by, police say, and became progressively agitated. But before the dog could bite Lynch, Mr. Hendry allegedly did it for him. Ellie May followed suit and at one point Hendry's teeth were in Lynch's hand as the canine's were in his leg. After Lynch dislodged both attackers, he called 911. However, . notes the News-Journal, the dispatcher had to ask to speak to Mrs. Lynch after she was unable to understand the situation through Mr. Lynch's loud obscenities. 'I'm . bleeding to death,' he screamed as Mrs. Lynch took the phone and . explained that it was, in fact, the second time her husband had been . bitten by the dog. Police arrived to find all parties seething but none had serious injuries. 'The only time she’s ever bitten him is when he was fighting with me,' Hendry maintained. 'She’s a sweet dog. 'That . guy next door is always standing outside yelling at people who drive . by. He yells at his wife and his children. It’s terrible.' However, after questioning, it was the Hendrys who went to jail. John Hendry was charged with one count of battery causing bodily harm, while Jessica was charged with two. They were both out on bail by early Monday.",It was father and daughter versus husband and wife in the scuffle in Oak Hill on Sunday .
"By . Joel Christie . A 26-year-old Oklahoma student who did not know his girlfriend had adopted out his son has successfully won full-time custody of his child. Jeremiah Sampson, of Coweta, has officially been a full-time single dad since Christmas last year. However his battle to win back his son, three-year-old Hilkya, has taken three years and cost him almost everything he has. In 2008, Sampson was recruited to play running back and receiver for Pittsburg State, a small public university in southeast Kansas, where he met his girlfriend, Tulsa World reported. Worth the fight: Jeremiah Sampson, 26, now has full custody of his son, Hilkyah, 3 . 'I wasn't looking to settle down or anything like that,' he said. 'We both understood it wasn't serious.' In December 2009, after not seeing him for a few weeks, the girlfriend came to his house with an opened box of pregnancy tests and disappeared into the bathroom to take one, Sampson said. When she came out, she showed him the positive result. Sampson said they needed to go to a doctor but she refused, causing him to doubt her pregnancy. 'I really thought it was trickery,' he said. 'I thought it was all mind games.' The relationship ended and he heard nothing else about the pregnancy, Sampson said, until March 2010. His cellphone rang as he was walking out of class. A woman identified herself as a representative of an adoption agency. 'You've been alleged as a potential father,' she told him. Sampson asked for a paternity test. Jeremiah Sampson grew up in a family of eight children with a single mother, and said he feels strongly about the roles a father should play . 'If I'm the father I want it,' he said. ""The mother has already put the baby up for adoption,' the woman said. 'I don't want that,' Sampson insisted. 'It's not necessary. That doesn't need to happen.' In September 2010, Sampson was awaiting the birth of his child, and a few nights before the due date he stayed up all night texting his ex-girlfriend. She was complaining about contractions. At daybreak he drove two hours to Joplin, Missouri, to be with her, but when he got there she wasn't answering her phone. The hospital had no information. He drove to her house and her grandmother slammed the door in his face. Stunned, he sat in his car across the street. 'Sir,' a neighbor knocked on his window, 'is there anything I can do for you?' It took him three years, but Jeremiah Sampson was finally reunited with his son at Christmas, when he received full-time custody . Sampson explained the situation. 'Oh, honey,' she said. 'That baby was adopted three weeks ago.' Under the advice of a police officer, Sampson found an attorney. Sampson drove five hours to Rolla, Mo., once or twice a week for more than six months to challenge the adoption in court. His son now lived in Florida, but under orders from the judge, the adoptive parents brought the baby to Rolla when he was 6 months old. Sampson caught his first glimpse of him in the courthouse lobby, but the other parents quickly threw a towel over the baby's head. 'I saw how they looked at me - like I was the devil,' Sampson said. 'How can anybody hate me that much? I'm the father.' 'People complain about men who don't take responsibility for their children. 'Well, here I am, wanting to be a father to my son. An earlier photo of Jeremiah Sampson and his son, Hilkya, who he says was put up for adoption without his permission . 'And that makes me a bad guy?' The judge nullified the adoption in July 2011 and temporarily put the baby in state custody while giving Sampson visitation rights. Hilkyah, pronounced Hill-Kye-Yah, warmed up immediately to Sampson's attorney. But light-skinned with streaks of blonde in his hair, Hilkyah wouldn't come to his father, who's dark-skinned with shoulder-length dreadlocks. 'They say babies are color blind or don't notice any of that,' Sampson said. 'But I tell you, they do. They notice.' It didn't take long to bond, however. 'He has a lot of energy and reminds me a lot of myself,' Sampson said. He shared custody 50-50 with the birth mother until the day after Christmas last year, when a Missouri judge granted Sampson full custody with visitation from the mother. Sampson dropped out of college to pay for the three-year court battle. The custody battle of Jeremiah Sampson is similiar to the epic case of 'Baby Veronica', in which a biological father in Oklahoma was pitted against adoptive parents out of state in 2011 . He now works as a mental-health technician and plans to start nursing school this summer. His case resembles last year's monumental 'Baby Veronica' custody battle, pitting a biological father in Oklahoma against adoptive parents out of state. Veronica went to South Carolina for the first two years of her life before her father, Dusten Brown, won custody in 2011 and brought her back to Nowata, an hour north of Tulsa. Then Veronica's adoptive parents appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and, after a four-month standoff in various courtrooms across Oklahoma, took Veronica home to Charleston last September. Sampson is now suing the adoption agency for allegedly violating his parental rights by going ahead with the placement even after he objected.","Jeremiah Sampson was playing football for Pittsburg State University in Kansas in 2009 when he began dating a girl, who then fell pregnant .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Top talker: MSNBC host Chris Matthews has been selected as the commencement speaker for Ohio State University but many students feel slighted by the pick . Students at Ohio State University are outraged that MSNBC host Chris Matthews has been selected as their graduation speaker. 'The response from students is simply that we don’t know who this guy is, we don’t care about this guy,' student government president Taylor Stepp said. Students at the state school have spoken out after the announcement last week that Matthews will speak at their commencement ceremonies in May. Matthews has headlined a talk show since 1997- first Hardball With Chris Matthews which is now called The Chris Matthews Show. The school lauded Matthews, 68, in their press release announcing his selection by praising his 'remarkable depth of experience and has distinguished himself as a broadcast journalist, newspaper bureau chief, presidential speechwriter, congressional staffer and best-selling author'. The well-known Democrat has also written six books about politics, and even though the most recent book is about how bipartisanship thrived during the Reagan administration, some students have reportedly taken issue with his personal allegiances. 'The fact that Mr Matthews obviously has a very liberal leaning and he’s not even a public official was irksome to me,' Mr Stepp said to The Columbus Dispatch. Democratic process: In the past, students were able to weigh in with suggestions for who the graduation speaker should be but the university took that privilege away this year allegedly on account of speed . Matthews would be far from the most . prominent Democrat to speak to the students, as President Obama was . their commencement speaker last year. According . to the school, former presidents Ford, Bush Sr, Bush Jr and Clinton . have all spoken at earlier ceremonies, as well as Speaker of the House . John Boehner- a native Ohioan. Some of the backlash may be a result of the decision to change the selection process, taking the former input from students out of the equation. In the past, suggestions were given to . University officials after a search committee made up of school . professors and select students compiled a list of suggestions. Liberal leanings: Matthews would be far from the first Democrat to speak at the school, as their commencement speaker last year was President Obama . Big crowd: The massive football stadium filled up during the 2013 speech including many of the more than 57,000 enrolled students . This year, that search committee was disbanded. 'Because of time constraints and leadership changes during the past year, the decision was made to use a more streamlined approach to speaker selection for spring 2014 commencement,' university spokesman Gary Lewis told The Dispatch. Matthew's current speaking fee is unknown, but ThinkProgress reported that in 2005 he earned approximately $35,000 from one event that year.","The MSNBC host has been chosen by Ohio State officials to speak at graduation but students are mad because they didn't get to weigh in .

"By . Luke Garratt . Two festival goers were arrested at the annual Utah Festival of Colors in Spanish Folk, an event that is largely peaceful and strictly drug and alcohol free, for charges of drug dealing, disorderly conduct and criminal mischief. Cory Sutterfield, 18, of Sandy was arrested after allegedly throwing colored chalk at a Utah County sheriff's deputy who was managing traffic at the festival in Spanish Fork. Tanner McBride, also 18, of Herriman, was arrested for possession of marijuana, possession of prescription drugs and intent to sell drugs, as well as being caught with six teens under 18 in his car when an officer pulled him over for speeding. Cory Sutterfield, 18, of Sandy (left) and Tanner McBride, 18, of Herriman (right) who were arrested at the Utah Festival of Colors for charges including disorderly conduct, criminal mischief and drug dealing . Sutterfield was eventually caught not only because of disorderly conduct, but also because the police had a warrant out for his arrest. McBride had been caught with various drug paraphernalia, such as a marijuana grinder, a 'baggies containing a green leafy substance', prescription drugs and cash, according to a police report. The report from the arresting officer said: 'He told me that he had been selling marijuana at the festival.' McBride also faces charges of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, due to his involvement with under 18s. A reveler covered in colored corn starch during the 2014 Festival of Colors, Holi Celebration at the Krishna Temple in Spanish Fork, Utah . The festival, which took place in Spanish Fork, was attended by nearly 70,000 people, and is set up to commemorate Holi, an ancient Hindu celebration. Each year the participants celebrate the festival by throwing dyed corn starch and coloured chalk to signify the arrival of spring. In the Hindu religion, spring is a time for forgiveness and renewal. Priest of the Sri Sri Radha Krishna Temple in Spanish Fork, Caru Das, said: 'There's all that youthful energy that sometimes, in terms of religion, . we don't really offer an outlet to in a pure, constructive, . consciousness-raising way, to have a really great time.' The two teenagers were arrested at the event for drug offences and mischievous behavior at a festival which is supposed to be drug and alcohol free . Nearly 70,000 people attended the festival of colors, many of them being members of the Mormon community, as well as students from local universities . A large percentage of the people attending the festival were celebrating it peacefully, and a great deal of them were part of the young Latter-day Saint community. 'The young Latter-day Saint people resonate with it because they can . celebrate their spirituality in an atmosphere that's totally drug- and . alcohol-free, not totally, but that's our intent, and those arrests were . made because of our zero-tolerance policy for those things.' No one is permitted to throw colored starch inside the temple because it is considered sacred. Mr Das says Brigham Young University and Utah Valley University students go to the temple for their world religion and anthropology classes, and the temple also holds twice-weekly services and community events. The revelers use combinations of colored corn starch and colored chalk in the Hindu festival, which is celebrated around the world . The only things bringing down the event were the arrests, and the prospect of a massive clean up effort that would came after the event had finished . Despite the arrests, he called the festival a spiritual, and financial, success, and said that funds raised during the festival sustain the religious community and help the members take the festival to other cities. He said: 'When you throw the colors to the wind, you are throwing up your . resentments and you're looking toward a future that's so great, you need . sunglasses to face it.' After the festival came the massive clean up effort, where most of the participants were 'very helpful'.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . Last minute: 57-year-old Michelle Byrom was scheduled to be executed last Thursday but an appeals court has granted her a new trial . A death row inmate who prosecutors say recruited her son in a plot to kill her husband will get a new trial, the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled Monday in a rare order for a prisoner awaiting execution. Michelle Byrom, now 57, was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in 2000 in Tishomingo County in the killing of her husband, Edward 'Eddie' Byrom Sr., and for recruiting her son in the plot. Byrom Sr. was fatally shot on June 4, 1999, at the couple's home in Iuka. Byrom's attorneys say they have new evidence in the case, and Byrom now argues her son committed the slaying. She argues in court briefs that her son confessed in conversations with a forensic psychologist. She argues the statements were discussed with the trial judge but were never revealed to Michelle Byrom or her attorneys before her trial. She also says the psychologist was not allowed to testify about them. In the high court's two-page order, Justice Josiah D. Coleman said the original trial judge, Circuit Judge Thomas J. Gardner, will not preside over Byrom's re-trial. Coleman said the circuit court in Tishomingo County will assign another judge to the case. Scroll down for video . Let out early: Edward Byrom Jr, Michelle's son, was released from prison in 2013 even though he confessed on four different occasions to being the one to shoot his father . In the high court's two-page order, Justice Josiah D. Coleman said the original trial judge, Circuit Judge Thomas J. Gardner, will not preside over Byrom's re-trial. Coleman said the circuit court in Tishomingo County will assign another judge to the case. The high court did not elaborate on how it reached its decision. Coleman said, however, the high court's decision was 'extraordinary and extremely rare in the context of a petition for leave to pursue post-conviction relief.' Mississippi has one other woman on death row, but the state has not executed a woman since 1944. Death Row: Without the court's ruling, Byrom would have been the first woman put to death in Mississippi since 1944 . State Attorney General Jim Hood did not immediately respond to requests for comment. David . Voisin, a Jackson attorney working with Michelle Byrom's legal team, . said in a statement Monday that the decision gives Byrom ""a fair . opportunity to have her case heard in court. 'Michelle . suffered extreme sexual and physical abuse from an early age and . throughout her marriage. We are pleased that Ms. Byrom will now have the . opportunity to present the overwhelming evidence that she is innocent . of murder-for-hire,' Voisin said. State . and federal courts have in the past denied Byrom's arguments that she . should not be put to death because she was sexually and physically . abused by her husband. Hood . asked in February for the court to set Byrom's execution for this past . week. The Supreme Court denied that request last Thursday. Abused: Both 'Junior' (pictured left and right) and his mother were physically abused- and his mother was sexually- by their father before Junior shot him in a fit of rage . Prosecutors . said Michelle Byrom killed her husband of 20 years for money, and that . she planned to pay a hit man $15,000 with proceeds from the estate, . estimated at more than $350,000. In . a rare move, she asked Gardner, instead of the jury, to decide whether . she should serve life in prison or be put to death. Gardner sentenced . her to death. Eddie . Byrom Jr. testified against his mother during the trial as part of a . plea bargain. He later pleaded guilty to several charges in the . murder-for-hire scheme, including conspiracy to commit murder. Gardner . sentenced him to 50 years in prison with 20 years suspended. Joseph . Dale Gillis, who was described in court documents as the hit man, . pleaded guilty to lesser charges of conspiracy to commit capital murder . and accessory after the fact.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Facebook has released a county-by-county map of the United States that shows the baseball allegiances of Facebook users in every county in the entire country. The interesting graphic of the regional pockets of fandom reveals one thing: The New York Yankees are undeniably America's team. In just about every region of the county, there are pockets of fans loyal to the Bronx Bombers. In regions that don't have a nearby team - like Alaska and Hawaii - baseball fans seem to support the Yankees by default. Facebook's mapping of fans is not at all scientific - but it certainly is interesting to look at, and to see some of the anomalies of the often regional fan-bases. Opening Day: Facebook mapped the baseball allegiances of every American county - in black on the map, the Yankees appear to be America's Team . Pockets of Yankee fans can be found in almost every region of the country. One of the more surprising spots of Yankee fandom is a small county in Virginia that is surrounded by local favorites, the Baltimore Orioles and the Washington Nationals. In the center of the region is one lone county of Yankee fans. For the most part, regions are loyal to the team closest to them - people in Minnesota tend to be Twins fans, New Englanders almost exclusively support the Boston Red Sox and people in Washington state are Seattle Mariners fans. However, in certain states with more than one team, the mapping of fans can be a bit scattered - for example, California, Texas and Florida are divided into fans of each of their multiple teams, again it tends to be influenced by which team is geographically closest to each county. Boo: New York Mayor Bill de Blasio got booed as he threw out the first pitch at the New York Mets' home opener on Monday . Wrong team: New Yorkers overwhelmingly support the Yankees over the Mets, a sure sign Mayor de Blasio is extremely out of touch . New York also has multiple teams, but fans' allegiances seem to be only for the Bombers - the New York Mets are one of only three professional baseball teams to not carry a single U.S. county. The other teams without a spot on the map are the Oakland Athletics, who compete with their cross-bay rivals, the San Francisco Giants, and the Toronto Blue Jays, which is the only Major League Baseball organization not based in the U.S. The top five teams that carry the most counties are the Yankees with the one spot, followed by the Atlanta Braves, the Texas Rangers, the St. Louis Cardinals and the Minnesota Twins, respectively. The teams with the most number of fans based on 'likes' on Facebook are the Yankees, the Red Sox, the Chicago Cubs, the San Francisco Giants and the Texas Rangers, respectively. Padres: San Diego competes with four California teams for the state's baseball fans - and is losing (maybe its the uniforms) Beltway: The Baltimore Orioles are the favorite team of the Washington beltway, beating out the Washington Nationals for many of the region's fans .","Facebook created a county-by-county map showing the baseball allegiances of every county in the United States .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Saudi Arabian man injured in the Boston Marathon bombings has filed a defamation lawsuit against Glenn Beck after the conservative radio host accused him of being 'the money man' behind the fatal attack. The former Fox News host concocted a conspiracy theory following the April 2013 attack that connected Alhabri to al Qaeda and from there linked the idea to the Obama administration. Adding to the absurdity of Beck's claims that Abdulrahman Alharbi, 20, was a conspirator in the Boston bombings is the fact that Alharbi was a spectator at the race who was one of hundreds of people injured in the terrorist attack. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Conspiracy theory: Glenn Beck claimed that a Muslim victim of the Boston Marathon bombing was somehow behind the attack . Not involved: Abdulrahman Alharbi was investigated after the bombing and authorities quickly concluded he had nothing to do with the attack . Beck hinged his theory that Alharbi was . somehow responsible for the attack on the fact that he 'was set to be . deported under section 212 3B' for 'terrorist activities.' The radio host spent the next several days lobbing unfounded accusations against the young Saudi Arabian man, challenging anyone who didn't believe him to prove him wrong. Beck even suggested that President Obama was somehow involved in the attack after photos emerged of what appeared to be Michelle Obama visiting Alharbi in the hospital following the attack - as she did with dozens of the bombing victims. Beck's campaign to pin the attack on Alharbi was stalled when a former immigration official explained to him how a person would get the designation of 212 3B, and how his theory about Alharbi 'doesn't make sense.' After the appearance by former INS Special Agent Bob Trent seemed to discredit the majority of Beck's theory, the radio host went from talking about it every day to rarely mentioning it, apparently hoping his listeners would forget that it ever happened. One person who definitely didn't forget is Alharbi, who has named Beck and his companies, The Blaze Inc. and Mercury Radio Arts - as well as his radio syndicator, Premier Radio Networks - in the defamation lawsuit it filed in federal court. Tragic: Three people were killed during the bombing, as well as a police officer fatally shot by one of the suspected bombers . According to the suit, first obtained by Courthouse News, Beck 'repeatedly and falsely' identified Alharbi as having been an active participant in the attack. On April 21, less than a week after the attack, Beck went on his radio program and said, 'Let me just say this to those at the highest echelons of government, we know who this . Saudi national is, and it is in your best interest and the best interest . of integrity and trust for the people of United States of America – . it’s best coming from you, not coming from a news organization. It’s . best coming from you. You have until (April 22). We have information on . who this man is, (and) we know he is a very bad, bad, bad man.' Beck later identified this 'very bad, bad, bad man ' as Alharbi. After the April 15 bombing, authorities questioned Alharbi, who allowed officer to search his apartment. Authorities quickly determined that Alharbi had nothing to do with the bombing - other than having been injured in the attack. Alharbi was one of about 265 people injured during the April 15, 2013, blast th . But Beck's onslaught claiming he was a terrorist waged on - which led to harassment from those who those who believed Alharbi was responsible for the bombing.' According to the suit, since Beck made his claims that Alharbi was behind the terrorist attack, people have left the young Saudi messages calling him a 'murderer, child killer, and terrorist.' The harassment, Alharbi's attorneys say, was the direct result of Beck's unfounded claims that he was involved in the bombings. 'Those statements were made widely and publicly,' the suit claims. 'The . statements were false and did grave injury to the plaintiff.' Alharbi is seeking punitive damages for defamation with malice.","For several days after the Boston bombing, Conservative radio host Glenn Beck claimed he had proof that a 20-year-old Saudi national was the 'money man' for the attack .
Abdulrahman Alharbi, the man Beck claimed was responsible for the bombing, was actually injured in the attack .
Authorities investigated Alharbi and quickly determined he had nothing to do with the bombing .

"By . Associated Press . The United States is talking with Israel about releasing convicted spy Jonathan Pollard early from his life sentence as an incentive to the Israelis in the troubled Mideast peace negotiations, people familiar with the talks said Monday. Releasing Pollard, a thorn in U.S.-Israeli relations for three decades, would be an extraordinary step underscoring the urgency of U.S. peace efforts. Two people describing the talks cautioned that such a release - which would be a dramatic turnaround from previous refusals - was far from certain and that discussions with Israel on the matter were continuing. Both spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the talks on the record. In return for the release, the people close to the talks said, Israel would have to undertake significant concessions to the Palestinians in Middle East negotiations. Spy: This May 15, 1998 file photo shows Jonathan Pollard in Butner, North Carolina. An AP source says the US is talking with Israel about the early release of Pollard for concessions . Such concessions could include some kind of freeze on Israeli settlements in disputed territory, the release of Palestinian prisoners beyond those Israel has already agreed to free and a guarantee that Israel would stay at the negotiating table beyond an end-of-April deadline. Secretary of State John Kerry met for several hours late Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before sitting down with chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and another Palestinian official. Kerry was expected to meet again Tuesday morning with Netanyahu before flying to Brussels for NATO talks on Ukraine. U.S. defense and intelligence officials have consistently argued against releasing Pollard. Pollard, an American Jew, was a civilian intelligence analyst for the U.S. Navy when he gave thousands of classified documents to his Israeli handlers. The Israelis recruited him to pass along U.S. secrets including satellite photos and data on Soviet weaponry in the 1980s. He was arrested by FBI agents in Washington in 1985 after unsuccessfully seeking refuge at the Israeli Embassy in Washington. Meeting: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomes US Secretary of State John Kerry in Jerusalem on March 31, 2014. Kerry flew in to Tel Aviv on his latest mission to salvage peace talks after the Palestinians rejected an Israeli proposal for extending negotiations . He . pleaded guilty to leaking classified documents to Israel and received a . life sentence. President Barack Obama and his predecessors have refused . to release Pollard despite pleas from Israeli leaders. Apart from any negotiations in the meantime, Pollard could be released from prison on November 21, 2015 - 30 years after his arrest. He has been serving his sentence at a federal facility in Butner, North Carolina. White House spokesman Jay Carney on Monday declined to discuss any possible deal. 'He is a person who is convicted of espionage and is serving his sentence. I don't have any updates on his situation,' Carney told reporters at the White House. Ahead of his trip to the Middle East last March, Obama told Israeli television station Channel 2 that Pollard 'is an individual who committed a very serious crime here in the United States.' 'He's been serving his time,' Obama . said. 'I have no plans for releasing Jonathan Pollard immediately but . what I am going to be doing is to make sure that he, like every other . American who's been sentenced, is accorded the same kinds of review and . the same examination of the equities that any other individual would . provide.' The president . said at the time that he recognized the emotions involved in the . situation. But he added, 'As the president, my first obligation is to . observe the law here in the United States and to make sure that it's . applied consistently.' Negotiations: Secretary of State John Kerry is greeted by Saeb Erekat, Palestinian chief negotiator, and Palestinian Ambassador to Jordan Attallah Khairy, far right, outside the Palestinian Ambassadorís Residence in Amman, Jordan, Wednesday, March 26, 2014, where Kerry attended a meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on the Middle East peace talks . Various suggestions for deals for . Pollard's release have been floated over the years, and they were raised . again last week in the Israeli press. The long-running Middle East peace negotiations are snagged over several issues, including wither Israel will agree to release more than two dozen prisoners. They include 14 Arab Israelis whom Palestinian authorities consider to be heroes and freedom fighters. Israel considers them terrorists. Israel has already released three other groups of prisoners as part- of the peace negotiations that began last July. All had served lengthy terms for involvement in attacks on Israelis, and scenes of them returning to jubilant celebrations have angered the Israeli public. A fourth batch was scheduled to be released on March 29, and the delay has prompted Palestinian authorities to threaten to end the negotiations. Netanyahu has said he would present any additional release recommendations to his Cabinet - where approval is not guaranteed. Netanyahu's coalition is dominated by hard-liners who have been extremely critical of the previous releases. The final release is especially contentious because it is expected to include convicted murderers and Arab citizens of Israel. Carney . declined to offer details when asked about that prisoner release. 'This . is a complicated issue that is being worked through with the parties,' he said. Working for peace: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, points out members of his staff to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, at the Palestinian Ambassador's Residence in Amman, Jordan . Pollard is said to be in poor health. His case has become a rallying cry in Israel, where leaders say his nearly three decades in U.S. prison amounts to excessive punishment. Pollard enjoys widespread sympathy among Israelis, and Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders have routinely pressed Obama and other U.S. presidents for his pardon or release. Stiff opposition from the American military and intelligence community has deterred the White House. Intelligence officials have argued that his release would harm national security and that the U.S. must maintain a strong deterrent to allies by warning them of the consequences of spying on American soil. But there are signs that that resolve may be softening. In recent years, former secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and George Schultz, along with prominent figures such as Senator John McCain and former CIA Director R. James Woolsey, have all called for Pollard's release. Netanyahu has sought to link a Pollard release to peace talks before. During his first term as prime minister, Netanyahu pressed the issue as part of a 1998 interim deal with the Palestinians. President Bill Clinton rejected that request after fierce opposition from U.S. intelligence officials. Also during Netanyahu's first term, in the late 1990s, Pollard was granted Israeli citizenship. While Netanyahu was out of office, he visited Pollard in prison. In 2011, Netanyahu formally appealed to the U.S. for the release and made a personal plea to allow him to attend his father's funeral. The U.S. denied those requests.","Releasing Jonathan Pollard, a thorn in U.S.-Israeli relations for three decades, would be an extraordinary step underscoring the urgency of U.S. peace efforts .

"By . Associated Press . Authorities have arrested another leader of the vigilante 'self-defense' forces in western Mexico and accused him of participating in the killing of a rival mayor, the second such arrest in less than a month. The arrests come amid a broadening government crackdown on the vigilantes, who took up arms a year ago to fight the Knights Templar drug cartel. The groups became popular in many towns because they were able to kick out the cartel, whose gunmen had demanded extortion payments from local residents, farmers and businesses. But the vigilantes have brought their own form of lawlessness to largely agricultural Michoacan state, with rivalries, alleged thefts and possible links to a rival drug gang based in the neighboring state of Jalisco. Scroll down for video . Arrest: A vigilantes leader, Enrique Hernandez Salcedo, has been arrested in connection with the murder of the Mayor of Tanhuato, Gustavo Garibay, from the opposition National Action Party. The mayor is pictured lying next to his truck after he was killed outside his home on March 22, 2014 . The federal government envoy to Michoacan, Alfredo Castillo, said at a news conference Monday that the leader of the vigilante group in the town of Yurecuaro, Enrique Hernandez Salcedo, had been arrested for illegal weapons possession. Castillo said prosecutors were also planning to charge him with ordering the killing of the mayor of the nearby town of Tanhuato, Gustavo Garibay. Castillo alleged Hernandez Salcedo organized the March 22 killing of the mayor because Garibay 'was opposed to the presence of the self-defense forces in the town of Tanhuato.' He said authorities had previously detained 14 members of the Yurecuaro vigilante group under Hernandez Salcedo's command. Murder charge: Garibay, pictured, was shot as he was leaving his residence . Armed and dangerous: Men belonging to the Self-Defense Council of Michoacan engage in a firefight. The vigilantes say they are liberating territory in the 'Tierra Caliente' but they are becoming just as lawless . Five of those, including one who was . later found dead, allegedly participated in the killing of Garibay, . waiting for the mayor outside his house and attacking him as he emerged. Some of them implicated their leader in the crime, Castillo said. The town of Tanhuato was apparently strategic because it lies near Michoacan's border with Jalisco. Castillo said gangs would often kill people in Michoacan and take their bodies to Jalisco for burial in clandestine graves, though he did not say whether the vigilantes had been involved in those killings. Garibay was wounded in a similar attack in 2012, and his secretary was slain in February. The mayor was a member of the National Action Party of former President Felipe Calderon, a Michoacan native who began his military offensive against drug gangs in the state. Warfare: A wounded man belonging to the Self-Defense Council of Michacan is taken away during a firefight while trying to flush out alleged members of the Knights Templar drug cartel from the town of Nueva Italia, Mexico . Unrest: In this November 5 photo, villagers who are members of the local self-defense group gather to block a road in response to soldiers allegedly confiscating a handful of their weapons in Las Colonias, Mexico . The government had tolerated thousands of vigilantes toting assault rifles, until the March 11 arrest of vigilante leader Hipolito Mora on charges of having participated in the killings of two members of a rival vigilante faction. In the last week, Castillo said, federal and state authorities have arrested more than 50 members of the self-defense forces on various charges. There have been reports that some vigilantes are taking advantage of their position to loot properties abandoned by Knights Templar bosses. Estanislao Beltran, the spokesman for the vigilante movement, said he knew Hernandez Salcedo as a fellow self-defense leader, but said the movement would not cover up for anyone accused of crimes. 'Anybody who is guilty of something has to pay for it,' Beltran said.","A leader of the vigilante 'self-defense' forces in western Mexico has been arrested and accused of participating in the killing of a rival mayor .

"By . Ashley Collman . New York Mayor Bill de Blasio should have stayed at City Hall today instead of showing his face at Citi Field. The mayor threw the first pitch at the Mets opening day game but was booed by fans in the stadium twice, once when his name was announced and again when he took to the pitcher's mound. But the boos didn't have anything to do with de Blasio's performance.

Fans in the crowd said booing for politicians is common at Citi Field.

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated  Press Reporter . The Archbishop of Atlanta’s Roman Catholic Diocese has been put on the defensive after it was revealed he built a multimillion dollar mansion for himself using church funds. Archbishop Wilton Gregory’s $2.2million, 6,000-plus square foot palace has become a point of contention among parishioners saying it diverges from the example set by Pope Francis to live humbly. ‘They had an opportunity to be heroes, and I think it’s sad they they made a choice that is going to cause a lot of friction,’ parishioners Marci Maurer-Nunnery told CBS Atlanta. Scroll down for video . Palatial: The multimillion dollar mansion built for the Archbishop of Atlanta using church funds . The manse was built on land donated by the estate of an heir to the fortune earned by the author of Gone With The Wind, according to reports. The gift included millions of dollars, was worth $15million in total and was stipulated to be used for ‘general religious and charitable purposes.’ The archdiocese tore down the home originally on the property in Atlanta’s exclusive Buckhead neighbourhood and built the new home there over the past four years, a church spokesperson told WXIA. Neighbors include several professional athletes, CEOs and musicians. It was built using the proceeds from selling Gregory’s previous home, the spokesperson claimed, but that has not made it any less controversial. ‘The money could be better spent on parishes that don't have that money, for children who need help going to Catholic schools,’ Laura Mullins told CBS Atlanta. ‘We have to be very careful how we use our money to make sure that it's used in the most purposeful way for the least among us,’ she added to WXIA. Backpedaling: Archbishop Wilton Gregory has apologized and said he will live wherever parishioners want . Mullins is leading a group of outraged churchgoers protesting against the home, and apparently they’ve gotten through to Gregory. ‘I will live wherever my people want me to live,’ the embattled Archbishop told WXIA through a spokesperson, but he also penned an apology of sorts in a religious newsletter. ‘I am disappointed that, while my advisors (sic) and I were able to justify this project fiscally, logistically and practically, I personally failed to project the cost in terms of my own integrity and pastoral credibility,’ he wrote in the Georgia Bulletin. ‘I failed to consider the impact on the families throughout the Archdiocese who, though struggling to pay their mortgages, utilities, tuition and other bills, faithfully respond year after year to my pleas to assist with funding our ministries and services,’ he continued. On a mission: Pope Francis has made a point of living a more humble life than some of his predecessors, and even fired a German Bishop called the 'Bishop of Bling' The spokesperson insisted to WXIA that Gregory lives only in a small portion of the upstairs part of the home, and that it will be used mostly for entertaining and parish events, but parishioners are not buying it. ‘I have been a parishioner of Christ the King for 36 years, and I have never been invited to anything at the Archbishop's home,’ Mullins griped to WXIA. Pope Francis, since taking over the Catholic Church, has preached for humility, for members to be more charitable and to live more simple lives.

"By . Mia De Graaf . Some could spend all day walking among extinct, wild and giant animals in a natural history museum. But for this man, that doesn't quite cut it. Abraham Poincheval is going to climb inside the carcass of a grizzly bear - and stay there for 13 days. Isolation: Abraham Poincheval climbed into the grizzly bear at the Hunting and Wildlife Museum in Paris today . Crammed inside a space measuring just half a square metre, he will eat, drink, sleep and relieve himself while being filmed by two cameras. The project, Dans La Peau de l'Ours (Inside the Skin of the Bear), is a visual performance designed to make visitors to the Hunting and Wildlife Museum in Paris think about 'rebirth and the rite of passage'. Inspired by carcasses he encountered in the Alps, Mr Poincheval's bear is partly reconstructed to accommodate for his needs, and then covered by the original skin and fur. Director of the museum Claude D'Anphenaise is delighted by the exhibition, which started when Mr Poincheval climbed inside at 11am this morning. Mr D'Anphenaise told Mail Online: 'It is very interesting and our visitors are very excited. He has just half a square metre of space, and will only eat food a bear would such as insects and worms . For exercise, he has two rubber exercise bands and some space near his feet where he can stretch out . 'He had to work for a long time perfecting his menu to work out what could be kept in there, and working out a way he can get some exercise. 'He has to live in total isolation and be totally self-sufficient in a space not dissimilar from what an astronaut would experience in a rocket. It will be very very difficult for him. 'We have worked with him as well to come up with books for him to read while he is in there. 'Inside he has some more light-hearted books, a bit of escapism. On a table outside, we have a set of books relating to his experience like Walden by Thoreau. The abstract artist was inspired by carcasses he saw in the Alps, and wants visitors to think about rebirth . Necessities: Two of the legs will store water to sustain him until April 13, the other two will act as his toilet . 'Visitors can hold it up to the eyes, and he can read it from inside. 'It is very exciting.' Having excavated the bear structure, Mr Poincheval has filled up two of the legs with enough water to sustain him until April 13. The other two legs will be his toilet. Alongside a kettle, he has a selection of foods that a bear would eat, including dried fruits, insects, and worms. Claude D'Anphenaise, director of the museum, described Mr Poincheval as a man 'familiar with extreme situations' Visitors will be able to sit by Mr Poincheval and hold books to the bear's eyes which he can see through . The abstract artist, who has previously lived in a hole underground for a week, will spend the entire time sat semi-upright in a chair. For movement, he has rubber exercise bands and some room by his feet to stretch. Describing Mr Poincheval as a man 'familiar with extreme situations', Mr D'Anphenaise said: 'He has already attracted a crowd of people.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Half of workers in some areas are earning less than the so-called living wage, new research reveals. Unions warned working families were facing the biggest squeeze on their finances since Victorian times, with many not earning enough to live on. The living wage used by increasing numbers of employers pays £8.80 in London and £7.65 across the rest of the UK, but a new map reveals in many areas workers are paid much less. The research by the TUC reveals the areas were almost half of people earn less than the minimum wage of £8.80 in London and £7.65 across the rest of the UK . London Mayor Boris Johnson has been a leading supporter of the living wage, which is well above the government-set minimum wage which will hit £6.50 from October. A new analysis of wages by the TUC to mark the 15th anniversary of the introduction of the minium wage reveals how much pay levels vary across the country. Nationwide around 5million people earn less than the living wage. A league table of ‘black spots’ is stopped by Kingswood near Bristol where 48 per cent of people working are paid less than £7.65 an hour. Next on the list is Chingford and Woodford Green in North East London (43.4 per cent), Harrow West in North West London (42.4 per cent) and Sefton Central on Merseyside (40.4 per cent). The TUC said the picture was even worse for women, with more than half earning less than the living wage in Kingswood (56.1 per cent) and Bexleyheath and Crayford (51.3) per cent. TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady warned working families were facing the biggest squeeze on their finances since Victorian times, with many not earning enough to live on . TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘Extending the living wage is a vital way of tackling the growing problem of in-work poverty across Britain. ‘Working families are experiencing the biggest pressure on their living standards since Victorian times. ‘Pay has been squeezed at all levels below the boardroom and it’s costing our economy dear.’ While the minimum wage is the legal minimum firms must pay, employers choose to pay the higher living wage voluntarily. The rate is set independently and reviewed every year. The Tories, Labour and Lib Dems have all backed it. Miss O’Grady added: ‘The number of living wage employers is growing rapidly and unions are playing their part in encouraging more employers to sign up and pay it – but government must show equal initiative. ‘We need to see a far greater commitment to pay the living wage from government and employers, and modern wages councils which could set higher minimum rates in industries where employers can afford to pay their staff more.’ While some areas are dominated by low paid jobs, others pay well above the living wage. Just 5.6 per cent of people working in Poplar and Limehouse (East London) earn less than the living wage followed by 5.8 per cent in Runnymede and Weybridge (Surrey), 7.3 per cent in South Cambridgeshire and also 7.3 per cent in Islington South and Finsbury (North London). A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: ‘The Government continues to support employers that choose to pay the Living Wage. However, decisions on what wages are set at is for employees and employers to agree so long as it is above the National Minimum Wage (NMW). ‘Each year the NMW is recommended by the independent Low Pay Commission and this is set as the highest possible rate which will not damage employment prospects. ‘We have however asked them to look at how we could restore the real value of the NMW as the economy recovers. ‘Their new forward guidance gives us a much better understanding of how an economic recovery can be translated into faster and significant increases in the NMW for low paid workers, without costing jobs.'","Living wage is£8.80 in London and £7.65 across the rest of the country .

"By . Chris Pleasance . A pair of hungry egrets have taken the meaning of food fight to a whole new level after devouring a fish in mid-air. The hungry birds were photographed pecking each other after one of them caught a fish in Hungary, and the other decided to try and steal it. This funny fight was captured by Belgian psychologist Marc Costermans, 49, after he noticed the clash taking place at the Kiskunsagi National Park, Hungary. This pair of egrets have been pictured fighting over a fish in mid air in a national park in Hungary . Photographer Marc Costermans captured the images despite the tussle only lasting ten seconds . 'This winter most of the lake was frozen over, with only a little spot left for birds to catch fish,' says Marc, of Walhain, Belgium. 'Therefore the grey heron, great white egrets and the cormorants all had to come to the exact same spot if they wanted to get dinner. 'This caused a lot of fights between the birds, and at the moment I captured these images one bird had managed to catch a fish. A lake in the park had been frozen over all winter, with the exception of one spot where the birds were fishing . With so many birds competing for food in such as small space, Marc says there were regular food fights . 'Only he quickly had to then fight off all the other hungry birds who wanted to steal it from him for themselves.' Spending several hours at the national park, Marc captured the quick ten second fight between the birds from just a few meters away. Marc says: 'I've got a great response from my pictures with people thinking it's a funny series. In a different set of pictures a grey heron tackles and egret and tries to steal another fish from its beak . Marc says he hopes the photographs will cause people to look more closely at the birds around them . 'I want to show the beauty of nature through my photography. 'The best feedback I had received was from somebody who said to me that after seeing my photographs they now really look at the birds around them. 'I think this is the first step to positive things, because after seeing how beautiful nature can be people are more aware and are likely to respect it and preserve it.'","Egrets photographed fighting over dinner in Hungarian national park .

Jason Fallas, 20, and his sister Chelsea, 21, swore at bus driver Ingrid Cumberbatch before spitting in her face as she tried to call 999. Mrs Cumberbatch, 36, was forced to keep the spit on her face until police arrived so officers could swab it for DNA, a court was told. Jason, 20, and Chelsea Fallas, 21, swore at a female bus driver before spitting in her face, a court heard . The brother and sister walked free from court today, with Jason told to complete a 'positive thinking' workbook and Chelsea ordered to attend 'victim sympathy' meetings . The bus driver then had to undergo four hours of tests in A&E to determine whether she had contracted an infection, Llandudno Magistrates' heard. The siblings admitted common assault and threatening behaviour during the incident on January 25 at Penrhyn Bay near Llandudno, Wales. But the pair walked free from court after being ordered to go on 'victim empathy' sessions and complete a 'positive thinking' workbook. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said today: 'Sentencing in individual cases is a matter for the independent judiciary.' Ms Fallas was also given a 12-month community order while her brother given a four-month suspended sentence. Prosecutor James Neary told the court Mrs . Cumberbatch was driving her Arriva public bus from Rhyl, North Wales, . when the siblings got on the bus. Mr Neary said: 'During the journey . Chelsea appeared to be speaking angrily on her mobile phone. After 10 . minutes the bus stopped for a while to keep to the timetable.

'He was shouting and screaming. After Mrs Cumberbatch told him to get off he spat on her cheek, his face contorted with rage.' Mrs Cumberbatch, in a statement read to the court, said: 'Both got off the bus shouting and screaming. He came back again on the bus and spat again on my cheek.' The court heard how Mrs Cumberbatch was left feeling 'incredibly dirty' after the incident. She was told by police not to wipe the spittle off her face before they could take swabs for DNA. She was then taken to A&E and was subjected to four hours of tests in case she contracted an infection from the pair's spit. She told police nothing like this had ever happened to her in her six-year bus driving career and she was 'in disbelief' that people could behave that way. Elen Parry, defending, said the brother and sister had been returning from a visit to their father who was seriously ill in hospital and they were 'stressed and emotional'. She said 'red mist' had formed in their minds and they were now remorseful. Court chairman John Mortimer told the pair: 'Your actions were disgraceful. This isn't the sort of behaviour we expect in a civilised society.' Jason Fallas, of Llandudno, received a four months suspended jail term. He was ordered to attend 'victim empathy' sessions, complete 100 hours unpaid work, pay £200 compensation and £165 costs. Chelsea Fallas, also of Llandudno, was given a 'positive thinking' workbook to complete along with a twelve-month community order with 300 hours unpaid work.

"By . Sean O'hare . Denial: New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg denied plans for a home smoking ban . Anti-smoking police are set to patrol New York neighbourhoods and stop people smoking in their own homes, secret new documents reveal. Community groups will be sent out to convince landlords and tenants across the city to turn their private buildings into smoke-free zones, according to the documents seen by the New York  Post. The community groups would 'work with property managers, tenants, and others on adoption of voluntary smoke-free policies', the document says. In return for their work, each community group will collect a $10,000 bounty — paid for out of a Centers for Disease Control grant. The news comes one year after the city banned smoking in parks and beaches, despite promises by Mayor Bloomberg that there were no plans to extend a ban to apartment buildings. The document explains how neighbourhood contractors would help develop New York health department's agenda in tobacco, alcohol, exercise and diet. Contractors would improve community awareness and promote 'voluntary adoption  of smoke-free policies to reduce tobacco use and exposure to secondhand smoke'. Critics called the plan an affront to personal freedom and suspect that it has long been in the pipeline and waited for the public to get used to the public smoking ban before introducing one in homes. City politicians denied there was any such plan. Bloomberg spokesperson Samantha Levine said: 'The city is not banning smoking in private residences; as part of this federal grant, organizations can apply to fund projects that, among other things, educate the community on voluntary smoke-free housing policies. Ban: Landords will be able to change the wording on the lease and implement ban when lease comes up for renewal . Landlords interested in introducing a smoking ban need only change the wording on the lease once it comes up for renewal. Tenants would then have the choice of signing the new lease and accepting the terms or moving on. There are no laws prohibiting a landlord from banning smoking, according to real-estate lawyer Adam Leitman Bailey. Landlords need only change the language of the lease, and once it’s time to renew, the smoker can decide to move or stay. Landlord owners of condominiums would need a 66 per cent majority vote among their tenants in favour of a ban in order to implement it. Most restaurants in the city outlawed smoing in 1995, followed by bars and bar areas of restaurants in 2002. The document revelas that although the number of smokers in the city has . dropped,  850,000 adults and about 18,000 high school students still smoke.","Landlords to be persuaded to ban tenants smoking .

"By . Richard Spillett . Danielle Miles tried to set fire to Zorbas kebab shop in Saxmundham, Suffolk after she arrived late for an order . A furious mum who set fire to a kebab shop because it closed before she could get her chips has been jailed for 28 months. Danielle Miles, 26, rang Zorba's takeaway to order her late-night meal at 10pm after she’d been out drinking, a court heard yesterday. But the mum-of-three did not arrived to collect her food until nearly 11.20pm - minutes after the kebab shop closed. Ipswich Crown Court heard Miles then stood outside screaming 'I want my chips' and threatening to set the town centre takeaway shop alight. Godfried Duah, prosecuting, told the court  that Miles then pushed burning paper through the letterbox. Members of staff who lived at the kebab shop in Saxmundham, Suffolk, saw Miles laughing. Mr Duah said an employee rushed to put out the fire as she ran off. The incident caused £50 damage to the door on November 11, the court heard. Prosecutors said lives would have been put at risk if the fire had spread to neighbouring properties or if gas canisters near the front door had been ignited. Miles, of Saxmundham, admitted arson being reckless as to whether lives would be endangered and was jailed for 28 months. Workers at Zorba's kebas had to run to put out the fire, which caused £50 worth of damage . Roger Thomson, defending, said Miles has three children aged five and under and she deeply regretted what she had done. Mr Thomson said Miles had been drinking regularly and using cannabis but had cut down on both since launching the arson attack. He accepted Miles had set fire to the door and hurled abuse at workers inside as they watched her. 'It was done in their sight and there was no chance of it succeeding,' stressed Mr Thomson. He said Miles had been on medication for depression at the time. The kebab shop's owners have said they suffered from a spate of vandalism attacks from late-night drinkers. In January this year, they even offered a reward of 'kebabs for life' for information about who had vandalised their outlet in nearby Framlingham.","Danielle Miles arrived late after night of drinking and missed out on her order .

"By . Sophie Borland . Lord Warner warned yesterday that the NHS is so short on cash it may have to start charging patients, but new figures have reveal it wasted £48million on non-jobs . The NHS is spending £46million a year on non-jobs such as ‘play and communication workers’, ‘carbon managers’ and ‘car park environmental officers’, it has emerged. There are 1,229 staff in apparently unnecessary roles across the health service – on salaries as high as £90,000, an investigation has found. They include a part-time ‘arts in hospital co-ordinator’ at Dorset County hospitals on a £30,000 salary and a ‘green label development co-ordinator’ on £24,300 at Mid Cheshire NHS trust. Barts and the London hospital employs an ‘EU office director’ on £87,500 as well as an ‘energy and carbon manager’ on £35,500. Overall, the NHS is squandering £34million a year on PR staff, £3.5million on ‘green’ staff and £6.8million on equality and diversity staff. The revelations came on the day a former Labour minister warned that the health service is so short of cash it should start making patients pay a £10 monthly membership fee. Lord Warner, who previously advised Tony Blair on health reforms, yesterday also called for patients to be charged £20 a night for staying  in hospital. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, which obtained the figures from Freedom of Information requests said: ‘The NHS employs far too many people in jobs that do nothing to deliver frontline patient care.’ The highest paid non-job role is the communications director at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals on £92,300. Away from front line care the NHS spent £34million on PR and £6.8million on equality and diversity staff . And South London NHS trust – which was put into administration after racking up debts of £150million – still found the money to employ an ‘energising for excellence delivery lead’ on a £35,500 salary. The NHS has an annual budget of £106billion which, unlike other Government departments, has been protected from public spending cuts. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘There are now over 20,500 fewer managers, senior managers and admin staff, and nearly 14,500 more professionally qualified clinicians than there were in 2010.’","NHS employs 1,229 staff in non-job roles away from front line care .

"By . Jack Doyle . Public trust in the police has been severely shaken by recent corruption scandals, a major report warned yesterday. In a worrying assessment, Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary Tom Winsor said the public felt badly let down by the failure of officers to live up to expected standards of integrity. The Stephen Lawrence investigation, Hillsborough, Plebgate, revelations about undercover officers, the death of Ian Tomlinson during the G20 riots and other recent controversies have, he said, left the police damaged – despite ordinary bobbies being more honest than they were in the 1960s and 1970s. Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary Tom Winsor said the public felt badly let down by the failure of officers to live up to expected standards of integrity. File picture . In his 163-page assessment of the State of Policing in England and Wales, Mr Winsor concludes forces are: . But it is his conclusions around public trust in the police which will raise the most concern. He wrote: ‘Controversies and revelations of a serious and negative nature in relation to the conduct of some police officers, both past and present, have hurt public confidence in the police, and the morale of the very great majority of honest, hardworking, committed and brave police officers has suffered as a consequence.’ Andrew Mitchell: Victim of misconduct in Plebgate row . He added: ‘The police service has been damaged, but it is certainly not broken.’ Mr Winsor called on police leaders to ‘repair the damage which has been done’ with a commitment to the highest standards of professional conduct and to the vigorous and uncompromising establishment of the truth. Those who have violated the high standards that police officers should abide by deserve firm treatment, the report said. It said: ‘[The public’s] expectations are that police officers will adhere to standards of honesty and conduct which are appreciably higher than those demanded of most others. And it is in that respect that the public feel badly let down – and perhaps afraid – when police officers are exposed as having failed.’ Before he was appointed to head the HMIC, Mr Winsor wrote two reports proposing widespread and radical reforms of the police. Until then, policing workplace practices were ‘stale and discredited’ and some officers developed a sense that forces ‘deserved to be insulated from fundamental and searching review’, he concluded. The failure properly to combat the huge rise in cybercrime had handed the advantage to offenders and left the public at risk. ‘The internet opens a new portal in our homes to those who do us harm,’ he said. Mr Winsor pointed to burglary detection rates among forces as low as 15 per cent and also raised ‘real concerns’ about the handling of domestic abuse cases and car crime. And, he said, criminals have got off as a result of the sloppy writing of reports for the Crown Prosecution Service. Controversies such as the Stephen Lawrence (left) investigation and the death of Ian Tomlinson during the G20 riots (right) have affected public trust . Labour policing spokesman Jack Dromey said the report raised serious questions about the future of British policing. ‘Public trust in the police has been damaged by allegations of misconduct, failed investigations and cover-ups,’ Mr Dromey said. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Tom Winsor’s report rightly points out that recent allegations about misconduct have damaged but not broken public confidence in the police. The majority of police officers conduct themselves honestly.’","Stephen Lawrence, Hillsborough, and other controversies shake public trust .

"By . Rosie Taylor . and Sophie Borland . Continuing healthcare funding should be available to the families of those with degenerative diseases such as MS, Parkinson's and dementia, but many families are unaware they can claim . Tens of thousands of families are being denied vital NHS funding for the care of relatives with dementia and other debilitating illnesses, according to a damning report. Many are forced to sell their homes to pay for round-the-clock help – even though the health service should be picking up the bill. Other patients are dying before receiving any money from the bureaucratic system. Experts are now demanding an overhaul of the NHS continuing healthcare system. Some trusts have slashed their budgets to such an extent that funding is now nearly a quarter of what it was two years ago. A scathing report found the system is ‘not fit for purpose’ and fails ‘vulnerable people and their families at a time when they need the most support’. It claims few people are aware the funding is available or that they may be entitled to it. Charities including Parkinson’s UK, the MS Society, and Spinal Injuries Association, along with the Royal College of Nursing have today written to care and support minister Norman Lamb to demand an end to ‘illogical reassessments’ of progressively ill patients. NHS continuing healthcare is funding for patients who cannot live without medical help, such as those who are paralysed or in the final stages of a degenerative condition such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s. Alarmingly, the Government has no figures on the numbers eligible for such care, although 59,000 currently receive it. Charities have previously estimated another 60,000 should get the money but do not. But even this figure is likely to be an underestimate; there are 800,000 with Alzheimer’s and another 127,000 with Parkinson’s alone in the UK, although not all require 24-hour care. An inquiry by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Parkinson’s along with Parkinson’s UK found patients with long-term illnesses were being unfairly refused funding. Some trusts have slashed three quarters of their continuing healthcare budgets, while families of ill and vulnerable patients have had to sell their houses to pay for care . The inquiry’s Failing to Care report found they were subjected to endless  assessments and deferrals, meaning the application process dragged on for months or even years. Many gave up because the process had gone on for so long or their relative had died. Patients were assessed by a ‘tick-box’ list, and six in ten decisions were made without consulting a specialist in the patient’s condition. In one case a patient who had been deemed eligible for funding had it withdrawn after they became bed-bound – as assessors said this meant they were less likely to fall. In some cases families were quizzed about their finances instead of their relative’s care needs. Parkinson’s nurse Karen Guy told the inquiry: ‘The process is intimidating, humiliating, unfriendly, exhausting, degrading, aggressive, frustrating and adversarial.’ Steve Ford, of Parkinson’s UK, said: ‘It’s a disgrace that people are dying while waiting for the funding they’re entitled to.’ An NHS spokesman said it tries to ensure those eligible ‘receive appropriate care and support’. Leslie Goff's family were owed £18,000 for his care by their local health trust, but only got £4,000 after they agreed to strike a deal . When Leslie Goff’s health declined rapidly, he needed round-the-clock nursing care. The pensioner, then 82, was bed-bound with Parkinson’s and should have been entitled to NHS continuing healthcare. But his wife Doris and son David became locked in a battle with their health authority. In at least three cycles of assessments and meetings, they were repeatedly assured he was eligible, only to be told by separate panels that they needed to provide more information. All the while, Mrs Goff, who is now 78, was paying around £1,600 a month from the couple’s savings for her husband’s nursing home fees. Mr Goff died, aged 83, in March 2011 ‘without a penny’ having been provided by his local health authority in east London. Son David, 40, offered to abandon his claim for the full cost of care – around £18,000 – if they would pay for the final 12 weeks. ‘They agreed straight away,’ he said. The authority refunded the family just over £4,000.","Families of those with degenerative diseases can apply for care funding .

"By . Jason Groves . Opponent: MP Philip Davies fears that loving parents could be dragged to court on the say-so of estranged partners, nosy neighbours and disaffected children . A law to protect children from emotional abuse risks becoming a ‘charter for whining kids’, a Tory MP warned last night. Government sources yesterday confirmed that a so-called Cinderella Law introducing jail terms for parents who starve their children of love and affection will be included in the Queen’s Speech in June. Ministers said the move would ensure ‘emotional cruelty’ is treated with the same seriousness as physical abuse and children’s charities hailed it as a ‘monumental step forward’ for child protection. But critics said the law would be difficult to enforce – and warned that loving parents could be dragged to court on the say-so of estranged partners, nosy neighbours and disaffected children. The new offence would include doing anything that deliberately harms a child’s ‘physical intellectual, emotional, social or behavioural development’. Parents found guilty could face up to ten years in prison, the maximum term in child neglect cases. Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘No-one is going to condone the extreme levels of abuse that some children suffer. But there is a real danger that this becomes a charter for every kid whining and complaining about a bit of tough love from their parents. ‘I am sure it’s well-meaning, but we have seen in the past how easily these things get completely out of control with the result that perfectly decent parents, who love their kids and are trying to do their best, get dragged through the courts.’ He added: ‘Being a parent is a tough job and most people do their best – I don’t want to see them caught up by this. If the Government is going to go down this route then they are going to have to find pretty robust measures to protect ordinary, decent parents or they are going to create a monster.’ Jack Hart, of the Freedom Association, urged ministers to focus on helping parents rather than finding more ways to criminalise them. ‘This so-called Cinderella Law is yet another example of the state stepping in to criminalise parents where in fact education would be a far more powerful tool for combating harmful behaviour,’ he said. ‘Simply introducing swathes of new and hard-to-police legislation does not guarantee the right results. There should be a focus on helping parents who are having serious problems, not a rush to criminalise them.’ Changes to child neglect legislation would make 'emotional cruelty' a crime for the first time under what is being dubbed a 'Cinderella Law'. File picture . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg yesterday welcomed the proposals, saying current laws did not reflect the terrible impact on children of emotional abuse. But he acknowledged the need for ministers to strike the right balance to prevent intrusion into normal family life. Mr Clegg said: ‘You can’t micro-manage what goes on in the living room, in the family home, in the kitchen, in law. ‘But what you can do is make sure that where the state has to step in to stop maltreatment of children … that they reflect emotional and mental abuse just as much as more visible physical abuse.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg yesterday welcomed the proposals, saying current laws did not reflect the terrible impact on children of emotional abuse . Neglect is the most common reason for a child protection referral in the UK and emotional abuse is more common in these cases than physical abuse, according to the Department for Education. Former Tory children’s minister Tim Loughton backed the change in law and insisted it would not affect normal parenting. He said: ‘What we’re not talking about is somebody who shouts at their kid in the aisles at Tesco because they go off on one. ‘This has got to be sustained and deliberate emotional abuse and I think we need to be able to give the powers to social workers and others that we entrust with the protection of children in this country, so that when they see something they clearly think is systemic neglect of that child, ongoing neglect, they can intervene.’ A previous bid to change the law was blocked by ministers in February last year, with Justice Minister Damian Green arguing that it was not needed and that it was not clear ‘how a new offence would work in practice’. But following a concerted campaign by children’s charities Mr Green launched a consultation on the issue in the autumn. Sir Tony Hawkhead, chief executive of the charity Action for Children, said: ‘This is a monumental step forward for thousands of children who we know suffer from emotional abuse and countless others whose desperate situations have yet to come to light. ‘I’ve met children who have been scapegoated in their families, constantly humiliated and made to feel unloved. The impact is devastating and can lead to life-long mental health problems and, in some cases, suicide.’","'Emotional cruelty' could be crime under proposed child neglect legislation .

"By . Wills Robinson . Down under: Heston Blumenthal said his award-winning venue, the Fat Duck, would move to Australia next year, opening in Melbourne in February . Celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal is to move his landmark The Fat Duck restaurant more than 10,000 miles across the world. Billed by the restaurateur as 'the furthest migration of a duck', Blumenthal said his award-winning venue would move to Australia next year, opening in Melbourne in February. He said The Fat Duck would temporarily close its UK premises, in Bray, Berkshire - with staff and some of the furniture at the three-Michelin-starred restaurant moving around the world for six months. Speaking at a press conference, Blumenthal said: 'I'm going to shut The Fat Duck and bring it here to Melbourne. 'This is probably the furthest migration a duck - of any kind, let along a big fat duck - has made.' Blumenthal said the Australian venture would close after six months and he would return to the UK, with a new restaurant - Dinner by Heston Blumenthal. He said: 'This is not a pop-up restaurant, this is not a guest chef coming over and doing a few weeks or a period of time in somebody else's restaurant. 'We are going to pick up The Fat Duck, the whole team, and fly them over here. 'We're even going to pick up some of the bits of the restaurant - maybe the sign, maybe bits of the leather from the chairs - and incorporate it into the dining space in The Fat Duck.

A meal for two can cost around £190, and signature dishes include the Meat Fruit recipe - a chicken liver mousse made to look like a mandarin orange. Blumenthal shut The Fat Duck for two weeks in 2009 following an outbreak of the winter bug that left more than 500 people feeling sick.","Move has been billed by restraunteur as 'the furthest migration of a duck'

"By . Emma Lowe . Ken Hom, 64, intends to donate his global property estate to Action Against Hunger . He taught the British how to love Chinese food and acquired a multi-million pound fortune along the way. But celebrity chef Ken Hom yesterday revealed he would not be leaving his vast wealth as an inheritance upon his death – it will all go to charity. The 64-year-old former BBC star has invested in a number of properties around the world and said he now plans to leave his large estate to charity Action Against Hunger admitting because he started with nothing he does not understand why others should not do the same. Speaking about his finances at the weekend, Mr Hom said: ‘When I die, all my properties will be transferred to Action Against Hunger [which helps malnourished children around the world]. I don’t believe in inheritance. ‘I came into the world with nothing; nobody helped me. ‘One of the greatest things about making money is that I could support my mother. She quit her job at the age of 50 and then lived for another 41 years very comfortably. ‘My father died when I was only eight months old, so my mother brought me up and we were extremely poor. ‘We lived in Chinatown in Chicago and she worked in a factory making tinned Chinese food for the US Army. ‘We lived in two rooms and had to share a toilet with other tenants. I had so little food that I was tested for tapeworms by one school because I was so skinny.’ Motivated by experiences of being poor in his youth, Mr Hom’s first venture into shares was aged just 14 years old while he was working in his uncle’s restaurant washing pots and pans. He bought his first flat in California, aged 29, later selling it in 1998 for a profit of more than £150,000. The TV star, 64, does not have children and shot to fame in 1984 in the BBC series Ken Hom’s Chinese Cookery, he has written 20 books which together sold 1.7 million copies. He has also secured valuable merchandising deal with more than seven million Ken Hom-branded woks sold worldwide and his name on a range of Chinese food at Tesco. Ken Hom found fame in 1984 with Ken Hom's Chinese Cookery which was shown on the BBC . Today the businessman –who turned over more than £40,000 last year from book sales, merchandising deals and consultancy work – owns a flat in Paris worth £500,000 and a renovated 11th century period property in Toulouse. He also has a condominium in Bangkok with a swimming pool. In an interview with the Sunday Times, the TV cook admitted his most extravagant purchased was his investment in a wine cellar after a good year of book sales. The contents, which included £12,000 bottles of Louis Roederer Cristal 2000 champange, sold at auction for £130,000 a few years later. Touching on excessive incomes and the need to donate to charity, Mr Hom said: ‘I would like more incentives for people to give to charity. ‘People don’t need large amounts of money to live on — it’s obscene. Although I am a small fish in comparison, I admire Bill Gates and Warren Buffett for giving away their fortunes. ‘I give away about £30,000 a year to charity. I once donated £23,000 to the mentoring programme at Oxford Brookes University.’ Raised in America Mr Home began cooking as a child, and gave cookery lessons to fund his history of art degree at the University of California. In 2009 he was appointed an honorary OBE for services to culinary arts. His last TV series, Exploring China: A Culinary Adventure, appeared on BBC2 in 2012. Mr Hom holds an honorary doctorate at Oxford Brookes University.","Ken Hom found fame in 1984 with Chinese cookery series on BBC .

"By . Sean Poulter . The chances of Wayne Rooney and the rest of our boys winning the World Cup this summer are, to be realistic, not particularly high. Unlike the price of the new replica England shirt unveiled yesterday. Fans reacted with fury when they learned they must fork out £90 to wear the latest Three Lions design. Anger: England revealed its new kit with the short alone costing £90 for adults and £40 for children . 'Rip-off': There have been calls for a boycott of the shirt ten months after the last one came out . A parent wanting to get the full Nike kit – shirt, shorts and socks – for a 12-year-old would have to pay between £71 and £119. Hundreds . of supporters and some players took to Twitter to lambast Nike and the . Football Association over the prices. QPR's Joey Barton, who has played . for England, tweeted: '£90 for the new England shirt is taking the . mickey out of the fans. When will it stop? 'It's . literally a white sports top with an England badge on. Costs about £2 . to make in some sweatshop in the east. Appalling. Football again allows . commercialism to eat away at its soul. Something has got to give.' He . suggested ordinary fans are being priced out of following the national . game, adding: 'When will football/brands start to stop pricing them out. #workingmanssport.' Fans on Twitter called the high prices a rip-off and outrageous. The . kit – in both a white and a red away version – has been launched just . ten months after the shirts were last changed in May 2013. This appears . to be at odds with a long-standing convention to protect the pockets of . fans by changing the national team kit only every two years. Red alert: The England away kit for this summer's World Cup features fabric makers Nike says will keep players cool . DIY: There has been huge anger online with fans, including former striker Stan Collymore, passing on tips on how to make your own new shirt using older similar tops . Making a point: In lampooning the new shirt, accounts have shown people how to make something very similar . Nike . pointed out that as well as the £90 'match' shirt – designed for . adults, but which many children will want – it is also offering a . 'stadium' version. It has some small differences in design and materials . and costs £60 for adults and £42 for children, who also pay slightly . less for shorts and socks. But . ex-England player Stan Collymore, now a pundit, tweeted: 'A joke, just . make one please, £90 is a rip-off.' The row comes 11 years after the FA, . sports retailers and clubs were fined more than £16million for . colluding to inflate the price of shirts. All white: Rooney models the new home strip but there are grave concerns about the price by fans . Home: The white strip sports a v-neck collar is meant to be a nod to shirts of the past -  worn here proudly by captain Billy Wright for the 1954 World Cup . The . new £90 shirt is exactly the same as that to be worn by  England at the . World Cup in Brazil this summer. Nike claims the price is justified . because of the innovative cooling technology built into the kit to cope . with high temperatures. Nike . took over the lucrative England kit supply deal from Umbro last year . and is paying £25million a year to the FA which said it has no control . over the cost of shirts. An FA spokesman said: 'The FA is a . not-for-profit organisation that puts £100million back into the game . every year.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Pubs will stay open late for England games during this summer’s World Cup, despite warnings about the dangers of booze-fuelled violence. Home Secretary Theresa May said licensing hours would be extended for Roy Hodgson’s side taking on Italy from 11pm on June 14. Pubs and clubs could also see their opening times changed if England reaches the knock-out stages, in the face of opposition from police and town halls. Pubs will be able to stay open later for England Word Cup games in Rio, the Home Secretary Theresa May announced . Home Office minister Norman Baker rejected calls for pubs to stay open late to show the match against Italy. But Prime Minister David Cameron intervened and overruled him. The move is good news for England fans looking to celebrate the team’s victories or – as seems more likely - drown their sorrows in defeat during this summer’s tournament in Brazil. England’s two other group matches against Uruguay and Costa Rica kick off at 8pm and 5pm respectively, so will not benefit from the rule change. But if the team reach the knockout stages with 9pm kick offs the relaxation could come into play again in the event of extra time. In a written ministerial statement, Mrs May said: ‘The Government has consulted on whether to relax licensing hours nationally for England matches with late kick off times during the FIFA World Cup in June and July 2014. ‘Following this, the Government has decided to relax licensing hours nationally to mark England’s participation in the tournament. ‘The relaxation of licensing hours will relate to the sale of alcohol for consumption on the premises and the provision of late night refreshment in licensed premises in England, at specified dates and times only.’ The new Nike England strip was unveiled today, worn by (left to right) Steven Gerrard, Joe Hart, Wayne Rooney, Daniel Sturridge and Jack Wilshere . The Home Office previously rejected a request from the British Beer and Pub Association asking for an extension of licensing times to 1am for the Italy game. Mr Baker turned down the proposal, leaving pubs with the option of applying individually to local authorities for a licence extension through the temporary event notice system - at a cost of £21 each. But the Prime Minister ordered a rethink. Ministers have the power to relax the rules to mark an occasion of ‘exceptional international, national or local significance’, as was done for the Royal Wedding and Diamond Jubilee. In an effort to curb problem drinking, supermarkets and other shops will be barred from selling alcohol at below cost price from April 6 under new licensing restrictions brought in for the World Cup finals. The Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales, has argued the issue of which pubs can open late should be ‘determined locally’. Tony Page, LGA licensing spokesman, said: 'A World Cup summer is always an exciting time and councils understand that watching matches in a local pub is a key part of the whole experience. Councils also support moves that bring communities together and also help the local economy. 'However, licensing decisions should be taken locally. While councils will always look to grant extensions to well-run and responsible businesses, they need to be able to target their limited resources most effectively and protect residents living close to popular venues from unnecessary disruption. 'A blanket national relaxation means councils will not be able to plan ahead and minimise any disruption through sensible licensing restrictions but will instead have to react to issues as best they can.' Official Home Office documents point out that using the power during the World Cup could lead to ‘alcohol-related crime and disorder, public nuisance and risks to public safety.’","Drinking hours will be extended to as late as 1am for England matches .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A veteran of the D-Day landings has finally been honoured for his bravery, receiving six campaign medals 64 years after they were lost in the post. George Edwin Williams, 91, a former chief petty officer in the Royal Navy, served on a minesweeper at the Normandy landings. Enjoying hearing tales of his father's time serving in the war, the 91-year-old's son Stephen always questioned why his father had not received any medals. Honoured: War veteran George Edwin Williams has finally been honoured after six campaign medals marking his courage and bravery, serving in the D-Day landings, were lost in the post . Service: Mr Williams served as a chief petty officer in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, and saw service in the Atlantic and Pacific. He served on a minesweeper during the Normandy D-Day landings in June 1944 . After some research the solicitor discovered his father's bravery and courage should have been rewarded with six campaign medals. The Ministry of Defence had issued the honours in July 1950, but Mr Williams said they had never arrived at the family's home in East Ham, London. His son wrote to the MoD and was thrilled when officials agreed to reissue his father's medals. Mr Williams was presented with the honours during a surprise visit to the Royal Hospital School in Holbrook, near Ipswich in Suffolk. Captain Warren Bairstow CSC RAN, naval advisor to the Australian High Commission, pinned the 1939-1945 Star, the Atlantic Star, the Pacific Star, the France and Germany Clasp, the War Medal 1939/45 and the Defence Medal on his chest.

Proud: Mr Williams with his son Stephen, who discovered the medals had gone missing after questioning why his father had missed out on the honour . Mr Williams, of East Bergholt, Suffolk, said: 'It is amazing what you can find on the internet. He gave me the name of his ship and I managed to look up the ship's log. 'It confirmed all the stories he used to tell me and my brother when we were children. 't's a kind of closure. It's nice to honour people of that era. No matter how small their stature they were giants among men. How many of us could imagine doing it now?' His father, who now lives in Rayleigh, Essex, said: 'It's fantastic. I felt very proud. I will be telling more stories.' The veteran served on HMS Selkirk and the aircraft carrier HMS Vengeance. D-Day: Mr Williams was on board a minesweeper on the day of the Normandy landings in June 1944. Around 160,000 Allied troops landed on the beaches in northern France at the start of a campaign to drive German forces from France. The landings ultimately led to the defeat of the Nazis . In the Navy: During his career in the Royal Navy Mr Williams served aboard the aircraft carrier HMS Vengence. King George VI and the Queen Elizabeth are pictured aboard the vessel with Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret . Around 160,000 Allied troops landed on the beaches of Normandy on June 6, 1944, marking the start of a major offensive against the Germans which would end in the . There was an initial airbourne assault with 24,000 being parachuted into France before the sea landings began at dawn. British troops were dropped off on Gold and Sword beaches while their U.S. and Canadian comrades were tasked with taking Utah, Omaha and Juno beaches. Around 160,000 troops landed on the beaches of Normandy on June 6, 1944 to drive back the Nazi forces . Thousands of paratroopers and glider-borne troops were dropped in by planes behind enemy lines. Around 1,300 RAF planes were involved in the assault codenamed Operation Neptune, which started shortly after midnight under the command of General Bernard Montgomery. More than 7,000 ships and thousands of smaller vessels crossed the channel. The Normandy landings marked the beginning of Operation Overlord - the invasion of German-occupied Europe. Originally planned to take place on May 1, 1944, Operation Neptune was postponed for a month to allow time for the Allies to gather more troops and supplies. The timing was vital. The troops needed the right weather, a full moon and the correct tidal conditions to give the mission every chance of success. A deception plan - Operation Fortitude - was formed to ensure the destination of the landings was kept a secret. Commando troops coming ashore from landing craft on June 6, 1944 . The false plan highlighted Pas de Calais, much further east than the real target, as the drop spot.

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . A mother used her teenage son’s passport to fly from two UK airports. Elaine Willis, 49, was booked on a return Flybe flight from Manchester International Airport to Edinburgh.

A handful of airlines fly domestically, including EasyJet, Ryanair, bmibaby, British Airways and Virgin, who recently began a route between London and Edinburgh. Many ask for photographic ID at check-in gates for commercial reasons rather than security reasons. According to the Flybe website, a passenger must show one of the following forms of ID to fly domestically: . All passengers on Flybe international flights must be in possession of a valid passport and a valid visa if required. According to their website, Flybe insist passengers must present one of several forms of identification to board an aircraft for domestic travel.

They added there had not been a breach of security by letting Mrs Ellis on the flight. The mother said: ‘I got to the airport early to meet up with the girls for a weekend away to Edinburgh and it was only as we went through the security that I realised I had the wrong passport. ‘I was stood in the security queue when I just thought ‘did I pick up the right passport?’ ‘My face went white when I realised I only had Jamie’s passport and it went round the rest of the group like wildfire. ‘I rang my next door neighbours on each side and got one to scan over my passport as a text, but I realised he’d have no time to get it to the airport before the flight. ‘I decided not to risk telling them about the mix up and there was lots of angst on my part. ‘But I couldn’t believe it when they let me through - none of us thought for a minute that I would get through on a young boy’s passport. The checks were clearly very poor. ‘Once I got on the flight my neighbour passed my passport on to a teacher friend Alma Bell, who was flying up later in the day. ‘I thought then that I wouldn’t have a problem getting back, but on the return the girls suggested I see if it could happen twice.' A few days later, Mrs Willis attempted to return to Manchester using her son's passport. She said: ‘Amazingly on the Sunday out of Edinburgh exactly the same happened - nobody noticed that it wasn’t my passport. ‘It was even more unbelievable that I could do the same thing on the way back. It was absolutely astonishing. ‘In . the light of what has happened to the Malaysian Airlines it is clear . that security checks at airports have become much more lax and people . making the checks must be much more careful for the sake of everyone’s . safety.

"By . Suzannah Hills . A disgruntled mother  launched a hate campaign against a . primary school headteacher by spreading false rumours that he had . sexually abused her daughter has walked free from court. Teresa Hughes, 39, sent a 'garbled' hand-written letter to Phil Jackson and then bombarded the school with phone calls accusing him of trying to force her daughter out of the school. She then met another parent inside a nearby Tesco and pretended Mr Jackson had been suspended for touching her young daughter. Hughes, of Warndon Villages, Worcester, admitted one charge of harassment when she appeared at Worcester Magistrates Court earlier this month. But she was today spared jail when she was sentenced to a 12 month community order with supervision and ordered to complete 80 hours of unpaid work at the same court. Sentenced: Teresa Hughes, 39, pictured left, has walked free from Worcester magistrates court after pleading guilty to harassment of primary school headteacher Phil Jackson, pictured right . Hughes accused Mr Jackson of trying to force her daughter out of Lyppard Grange primary School in Worcester, Worcestershire . She was also ordered to pay £145 court costs and a £60 victim surcharge. District Judge Nigel Cadbury said: 'In some respects a garbled letter and some strange voicemail messages and a couple of conversations in a supermarket may not have been serious. 'But when you’re making false allegations against a headteacher it’s extremely serious because as we’ve heard it seriously affected that person’s private life, his reputation and the stress it caused in relation to his job. 'People in positions of responsibility are there and up there to be shot at and it’s a very easy target and the effect on those people when false allegations are made is extremely damaging. 'And that’s what’s serious about this case. You could have destroyed somebody’s career with untruths. 'I’m going to make a community order, you’ve come very very close to a suspended sentence. 'I think you must realise just how close you came to a suspended term of imprisonment.' The . court heard how the 'malicious unfounded allegations' caused Mr Jackson so much . stress that he likened it to being diagnosed with cancer. Hughes started the smear campaign following an incident in the school playground on June 11 last year. The court heard Mr Jackson was in the school playground welcoming . students into the school when Teresa Hughes' daughter approached him saying she wanted . to speak to him. Abuse: Hughes sent a hand-written letter to Mr Jackson before bombarding Lyppard Grange Primary School in Worcester with phone calls . Let go: Teresa Hughes, pictured leaving Worcester Magistrates Court on Monday, was ordered to carry out 80 hours of unpaid work . He said he would find her later and she went off but Hughes then went up to him two minutes later, raised both her arms in the air, and then walked away. On . the same day a letter arrived for the headteacher, who had been at the . school since 2009, which said that Hughes had felt used. The . court was told that Mr Jackson had found the letter confusing and . showed it to his deputy head, who told the governors about it and . contacted the local authority. Staff and governors sent a reply to Hughes after a meeting at the school two days later. But Hughes then . left ten rambling answerphone messages on the school phone between . 5.25pm on June 14 and 9.03pm on June 15. Some . said her daughter would not be returning to the school, while others . accused staff of trying to force her daughter to leave. In the voicemails, Hughes claimed they . were trying to get her daughter to leave the school and said she would . not let Mr Jackson 'get away with it'. The . mother then saw another parent in a supermarket and told him that Mr . Jackson, who had been at the school since 2009, had sexually assaulted . her daughter. Prosecutor Adrian Jones told the court: 'On June 18 Mr Rogers dropped his children off and walked to Tesco. 'He was aware of Miss Hughes because he has a daughter in the same class as her daughter. 'He was minding his own business when he saw Miss Hughes. He removed his headphones and noticed her daughter was with her. 'She said ""don’t tell anyone but Mr Jackson has been suspended"". 'He asked why to which she replied whispering ""for touching my daughter"". 'The defendant’s actions towards Mr Jackson caused him an amount of stress which he likens to when he was diagnosed with cancer.' Mark Lister, defending, said her . daughter, who no longer attends the school, had been taken into care as a . result of this case because of concerns for her 'emotional health'. He added: 'It involves a letter which was garbled. It’s also fair to say she left a number of telephone messages over one weekend. Again they are garbled. 'By far the most serious part is what she has said to people in the supermarket. 'Miss Hughes is not currently residing with her daughter or perhaps more accurately her daughter is not residing with her. 'Proceedings have been taken to remove her and she is currently staying with foster parents as a direct result of these allegations on the basis of emotional concerns for the daughter’s health. 'She acknowledges of course that her behaviour was wholly wrong.' District Judge Cadbury also decided not to put a restraining order in place banning Hughes from having any contact with Mr Jackson after the court heard she had avoided the headteacher ever since being arrested for the incident. Hughes refused to comment.","Theresa Hughes, 39, admitted harassing headteacher Phil Jackson .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . The long-awaited dredging of rivers on the Somerset Levels finally began today - three months after the area was hit by the worst floods in 250 years. Diggers began scooping silt from a 200-metre stretch of the River Parrett, near Burrowbridge, as the multi-million scheme got underway. Environment Agency (EA) engineers will clear around five miles of the river and the neighbouring River Tone in the programme - which is expected to take several months. Scroll down for video . Dredging began on the River Parrot, between Burrowbridge and Moorland today, three months after the area was hit by the worst flooding in 250 years . A digger works to remove silt on the River Parrett. Environment Agency engineers are to clear around five miles of the river in the £5.8million scheme . Furious locals blame a lack of dredging by the EA for the floods which destroyed their homes after the heaviest January rainfall on record. It is hoped the £5.8million dredging will improve the capacity of the rivers, which are currently operating at just 60 per cent, and reduce flooding in the future. Today's work is on a key part of the river which has been specially chosen because 'significant amounts' of silt have built up. Engineers used 22-tonne long reach excavators fitted with high-tech computers to help dredge the river to pre-determined profiles. It is hoped the dredging will improve the capacity of the rivers - which are operating at just 60 per cent due to the build-up of silt . More silt is removed for the bed of the River Parrett. The neighbouring River Tone will also be dredged . Smaller seven-tonne tracked dumpers removed the dredged material from the banks to disposal points. An amphibious excavator - one of just two in the UK - will work to remove silt from the more 'awkward' sections of the river in the coming days. The specialist equipment has been hired from private company Land and Water Plant. Director Richard Maclean said: 'Dredging the Parrett is no simple task and as such, it calls for some extremely specialist equipment. 'The amphibious excavator is truly amphibious. It is as happy working in a river as it is working on a marsh or next to watercourses. Those hit by the wet January weather blame the previous lack of dredging by the EA for the flooding. Today, one resident said the presence of diggers was a 'very welcome sight' Smaller tracked dumpers, pictured, removed the dredged material from the site today to disposal points . 'This machine is extremely rare and is able to work with ease in areas where conventional plant would either risk getting stuck or where it would be expensive and damaging to the local ecology to put in temporary roadways. 'It is anticipated it will be used for the more awkward sections of the River Parrett where more conventional plant cannot work.' Paul Leinster, chief executive of the Environment Agency, said yesterday marked an 'important milestone' in work to reduce the risk of flooding in the future. He added: 'We welcome the additional money from Government that has allowed us to undertake this further dredging. 'We are committed to dredging as part of the joint action plan, which includes other measures such as supporting farmers and making some temporary flood risk management measures permanent.' The start of the project was keenly watched by residents - many who are still unable to return to their wrecked homes. Gav Sadler, founding member of Flooding on the Levels Action Group (FLAG), welcomed the action but called for more 'transparency'. The equipment has been hired from private company Land and Water Plant. Its director said today the process of dredging would be 'no simple task' Mr Sadler, from nearby Moorland, said: 'It is a very encouraging sight, seeing the dredging on the river. 'It has been a long time coming. Hopefully some of our campaigning has led to that. We have got to remember that the 8km stretch they are working on is just the beginning. 'We would like to see all the rivers dredged. Another issue is we don't know the quality of the dredging they are going to do. 'They keep saying they are going to do a ""proper job"" and restore the rivers to the 1960s profile. We would like to see what they are reprofiling it to. 'We would like to see a little bit of transparency from the Environment Agency. This affects our lives, we want to make sure they do a proper job.' More silt is removed. The action today is part of a 20-year £100million plan - commissioned by Environment Secretary Owen Paterson - to ensure homes in the area are never flooded again . The dredging follows months of extreme weather. Earlier in the year, millions of tonnes of water were pumped off the Levels every day by 40 permanent and 25 temporary pumps. The Environment Agency has insisted that dredging would not have prevented the flood crisis. The action is just the start of a 20-year £100million plan - the Somerset Levels and Moors Flood Action Plan- to ensure their homes are never engulfed by murky flood waters ever again. It was commissioned by Environment Secretary Owen Paterson and includes a new tidal barrier and the raising key roads.","Diggers began removing silt from a 200-metre stretch of River Parrett .

"By . Tom Kelly . Susan Hackett, 68, was swept off her feet and trapped in the bitterly cold seawater for more than an hour . A woman drowned after being caught out by the rising tide as she walked her dogs on a beach. Susan Hackett, 68, was swept off her feet and trapped in the bitterly cold seawater for more than an hour. Her daughter Emma, who was with her on the Mother’s Day walk, also became trapped but was rescued by coastguards. It is thought the women were caught out when the tide came in very quickly at Cefn Sidan beach in Carmarthenshire, Wales. Mrs Hackett’s brother, Brian Marsh said: ‘Emma told me they had walked along that beach hundreds of times and the water had only come up to the top of their wellies. 'This time there was a huge surge that came up to their chests. They didn’t know where it came from.’ He said that the women, who had eight dogs with them, were not only trying to keep their footing, but also trying to help the animals swim. Walkers saw the women battling to stay above water and called for help, with a helicopter and two lifeboats arriving at the scene at about 5pm on Sunday. Mrs Hackett was airlifted to hospital but she could not be revived. Her daughter was lifted into an inshore lifeboat after one of the crew jumped in to keep her head above water. She was released from the West Wales General Hospital yesterday. Five of the dogs are thought to have drowned but three survived and are being looked after by a local vet. Swansea coastguard spokesman Marc Lancey said: ‘At the moment we’ve got spring tides – which means we have the highest of the high tides and the lowest of the low tides. ‘When we have a spring tide, the rate the tide comes in increases and so does the volume of water.’ An RNLI spokesman said crews were on the scene within five minutes of being called out. He added: ‘When the younger woman was back on land she confirmed she had been in the water for an hour. Her daughter Emma, who was with her on the Mother's Day walk, also became trapped but was rescued by coastguards. It is thought the women were caught out when the tide came in very quickly at Cefn Sidan beach in Carmarthenshire, Wales (pictured) Mrs Hackett's brother, Brian Marsh said that she and her daughter had walked along the beach hundreds of times, and the water had only come up to the top of their wellies . 'We were unaware of that when we launched.’ Despite the mild air temperature, the sea is still very cold and hypothermia would have set in quickly as the women tried to stay afloat. Mr Marsh said his sister was ‘very slight’ which is why they think she did not survive after an hour in the cold water. He added: ‘It is so very sad. This has been a huge shock to the family. We are all devastated.’ Mrs Hackett, who is believed to be a widow, moved to the village of Cynwyl Elfed, near Carmarthen, from Hertfordshire about ten years ago. Her new partner visited at weekends and was due to move to Wales next year when he retired. Residents said she was a quiet but popular woman who was known for her love of animals and the countryside. One villager said: ‘Everyone is very cut up about it – it is an awful tragedy for her family.’ An inquest will be opened later this week.","Susan Hackett, 68, trapped in cold seawater for more than an hour .

"By . Sam Webb . Accused: Brian Copsey, 59, allegedly stole £1,160,525 to spend on his wife and his children's school fees while he was finance director for a company run by residents to manage Bryanston Court in central London . An accountant swindled more than £1million from his neighbours at an exclusive West End apartment block to fund his 'extravagant' lifestyle, a court heard today. Brian Copsey, 59, allegedly stole £1,160,525 to spend on his wife and his children's school fees while he was finance director for Bryanston Court Management, a company run by residents to manage Bryanston Court in central London. Residents were left with nothing after the money 'simply disappeared into the ether' when the alleged fraud was uncovered. Copsey forged bank documents authorising money paid in service charges by residents to be paid to his own companies, bleeding the coffers dry in £100,000 lumps, it was alleged. Prosecutor Sarah Selby, told jurors at Southwark Crown Court today: 'The allegation against Mr Copsey is that over that period of time, a period of more than two and a half years, and whilst he was both the director and the finance chairman of a residents’ management company, that is for a block of flats called Bryanston Court where he lived, Mr Copsey dishonestly took that figure of just over £1million other residents’ money.' Residents at the luxury apartment block in George Street, Marble Arch, where an average flat costs £1.3 million, had built up a huge war chest for the maintenance and improvements. Ms Selby continued: 'He then used that sum of money for his own purposes, by paying for, the Crown says, his own extravagant lifestyle, by making payments to his wife and sons, and sons’ school fees, and by transferring a large amount to other companies and associates of his.' Copsey is charged with fraud by abuse of position and transferring money between different accounts for personal gain. He denies the charges. Ms Selby said: 'The initial fraud in count one is committed by Mr Copsey making numerous internet banking transfers. He removed a very large amount of money from the bank accounts held by the residents association. 'He was finance chairman of the residents association so he had effective control over the bank accounts and he transferred those funds of just over £1,000,000 into bank accounts held by two of his own companies.' The two firms were called Java Creek UK Ltd and Calisto Investments Ltd, and Copsey is also charged with transferring 'large amounts' of money which he spent on himself, his family and associates. The luxury apartment block in George Street, Marble Arch, where an average flat costs £1.3 million . Ms Selby continued: 'As a result of the offences, in fact, Mr Copsey cleared out entirely the bank accounts of that residents management company so that the other members were left with nothing. 'And when the offences were eventually discovered, and they were discovered at the end of 2011, Mr Copsey tried to claim to the other residents in the block that he had simply invested their money elsewhere, he said in order to obtain a better rate of interest and he claimed that he was therefore safely holding the money elsewhere and that he would return it to them the very next day.' Jurors heard how the accountant had taken up the role of finance chairman after his predecessor left the block in 2011. Before he took control the residents had saved up more than £2million which was being held by management company Lewis & Tucker. Jurors heard how the accountant had taken up the role of finance chairman after his predecessor left the block in 2011 . Unhappy that the company was holding such a large amount of their cash they chose to open a number of HSBC bank accounts and one investment account where they would hold the money themselves. As finance chairman Copsey had was responsible for running the association’s finances, with the operations apparently running smoothly for the first year. But on March 15 2010 he allegedly began to bleed the accounts of huge sums of money, beginning with £100,000 being paid to a company called Heritage, a firm run by a close associate. Just days later £30,000 arrived in Copsey’s own bank accounts, part of the money transferred to Heritage, it is claimed. Banking staff required two people to sign forms faxed in to release the funds. According to prosecutors Copsey forged the signature of one of his co-directors on the association in order to arrange the transfers. When police analysed his computer they found a digital copy of Henrietta Goldstein’s signature, along with copies of the transfer arrangements. She told police she had no idea about the payments, or knew anything about Heritage as it had never been used by the block. Wearing a navy suit, grey-haired Copsey spoke only to confirm his name when he appeared at Southwark Crown Court today. He was bailed on the condition resides at his home address and does not apply for travel documents or leave the country.

"By . Amanda Williams . Angela Douglas, 49, told police she wanted her frail 73-year-old mother to 'go to sleep' after watching her battle with emphysema, Plymouth Crown Court heard . A drunken woman smothered her sick and elderly mother with a pillow because she couldn’t stand to see her in pain, a court has heard. Angela Douglas, 49, told police she wanted the 73-year-old to 'go to sleep' after watching her battle emphysema, Plymouth Crown Court heard, . Douglas had been drinking heavily before deciding to suffocate her mother Anne Matthews, it was said. Mrs Matthews was a former smoker who suffered from breathing problems. She had suffered a heart attack - but was not terminally ill, jurors were told. The court was told that when when paramedics arrived to start CPR she allegedly told them: 'I don’t want you to do anything - she has been through enough.' Douglas admits killing her but denies murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Prosecutor Martin Meeke QC told jurors there was no question that Douglas suffocated her mother but it was their job to decide if it was murder or manslaughter. Mr Meeke told the court that Douglas visited her parents Anne and David, 72, in April last year with her partner Shane. She cooked the family Sunday lunch and had taken her mother tea and biscuits in bed before her partner and her father discovered her kneeling and crying over her unconscious mother. Mr Meeke said: 'On the 28 April last year the defendant decided to end her mother’s life. 'As her mother lay in bed, the defendant put a pillow over her mothers face and tried to suffocate her. 'Her mother must have struggled. She fell to the floor unconscious.' The court heard an ambulance was called but when paramedics entered her bedroom, Douglas told them: 'I don’t want you to do anything, she’s been through enough.' Asked if there was a ‘do not resuscitate agreement’ in place or an end of life care package, she replied: 'No there isn’t because my f****** family don’t agree with it. 'Can’t you let her go, can’t you leave her alone?' Paramedics managed to revive Mrs Matthews but she died at Plymouth’s Derriford hospital at around 2:30am the next day. Mr Meeke told the court that Douglas confessed to her partner that she had put a pillow over her mother’s face and killed her. She called the police herself within hours of the incident and was arrested. When questioned by officers, Douglas allegedly told them: 'I tried to kill my mother. I smothered her with a pillow. I love my mum, I can’t stand to see her like that.' Douglas said she didn’t know if she wanted her mother to die but she said she wanted her to 'go to sleep'. She said: 'I just lay down with her and stroked her. I think it’s cruel the way she’s been treated in and out of hospital. Douglas arrives at the Plymouth Magistrates' Court, Devon. She admits killing her but denies murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility . 'I just thought if I put a pillow over her face she would go to sleep. I don’t know whether I wanted her to die, I just wanted her to sleep. 'I then thought this isn’t good and I called the paramedic. I did push down and then thought ""what the f*** are you doing?"" and moved the pillow.' Doctors later found impressions on Mrs Matthews’ face consistent with having her glasses forced into her skin with a pillow. Mr Meeke told the court that ambulance workers thought Douglas was drunk as she was slurring her words. Douglas said she didn't know if she wanted her mother to die but she said she wanted her to 'go to sleep' Blood samples later revealed that she was as much as three-and-a-half times over the drink dive limit. Mr Meeke said: 'The defendant was a practised drinker. She could manage a couple, and sometimes three bottles of wine in an evening.' Douglas wept as the court heard how her mother, who had two other daughters, battled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She had been released from hospital a couple of weeks before her death before being visited at home by a social worker and an occupational therapist. Douglas, her mother’s principal carer, claims she was suffering from an abnormality of mental functioning which meant she didn’t know what she was doing. She claims to have had been suffering from an adjustment disorder as a consequence of failing to come to terms with her mother’s failing health . The trial continues.

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Dr Peter Rubin arrives at the hearing in Manchester today. It is alleged he slept with a patient in his consultation room before prescribing her the morning-after pill . A GP had sex with a patient in his consultation room before prescribing her the morning after pill, a tribunal heard today. Dr Peter Rubin invited the woman to the Woodlands Medical Centre, in Didcot, Oxfordshire, for 'non-clinical reasons', it is said. The pair had intercourse in the surgery on Christmas Eve 2007 before Dr Rubin told her: 'You had better take this or it will be just my luck you will be standing in an antenatal clinic.' The GP continued to send the woman - referred to as Patient A - . personal text messages for the next five years. She made a complaint when Dr Rubin forcibly tried . to remove her trousers and stared at her underwear during a consultation . in July 2012, it is alleged. The . shamed medic then begged Patient A to withdraw the complaint for the 'sake of . his child', the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service heard. Dr . Rubin is accused of misconduct at the fitness to practise hearing in . Manchester where he has admitted the relationship, but disputes some of . the patient's claims. He has . also confessed to asking a 21-year-old university student, referred to . as Patient B, to kiss him on the cheek after prescribing her the . contraceptive pill. The General Medical Council (GMC) allege his actions were sexually motivated, but Dr Rubin claims it was just his 'sense of humour'. The . GP, who was suspended in November 2012 and left the practice the . following month, could face being struck off the medical register. The hearing continues. The hearing was told how Dr Rubin bought Patient A a pricey Prada mobile . phone, treated her children to a Wii console and took her out for lunch . in Reading, Berkshire. Craig Sephton QC, opening the case for the GMC, said: 'On August 30, 2007, it was the day before Patient A's birthday, a parcel arrived unexpectedly at her home address and when she opened it, it was found to contain a Prada mobile phone, sim card and an unsigned birthday card. 'Unfortunately Patient A suffered a road traffic accident that very day and went to the GP surgery the next day where she saw Dr Rubin. 'Dr Rubin gave her a hug and in the course of the consultation he said 'Why is it that none of my patients wear nice underwear?' 'Patient A asked about the Prada phone and Dr Rubin said it was one of the most expensive on the market, but would not admit that he sent it at that stage.' The pair exchanged phone numbers and the medic began to send 'texts and photographs of an intimate nature,' the hearing was told. Several months later the woman brought her son to the surgery for blood tests and Dr Rubin asked what he wanted as a reward 'for being so brave', the panel heard. The boy said he wanted a Wii console and the medic brought the present around to her house just before Christmas. 'He arranged with Patient A that they would meet for lunch in Reading and he would pay for lunch,' said Mr Sephton. Dr Rubin is said to have prescribed the woman the contraception before saying: 'You had better take this or it will be just my luck you will be standing in an antenatal clinic' 'Dr Rubin told Patient A he was getting her a Christmas present and she decided she should get him a present and she went to the surgery on Christmas Eve,' he added. 'After the staff had gone home on Christmas Eve Dr Rubin and Patient A stayed behind in the surgery and there sexual intercourse took place. 'Dr Rubin gave Patient A a prescription for an antibiotic for a sore throat as she was supposed to be going to a carol concert and had to explain why she was late. 'This was a pretext. Of course she had no sore throat. He also gave her a prescription for the morning after pill and said 'you had better take this or it will be just my luck you will be standing in an antenatal clinic'.' The GMC say he later tried to conceal his motive behind giving her the medication when he added a false entry to her records saying it had been 'added by mistake'. 'The relationship between Patient A and Dr Rubin developed. He continued to send texts and photos of a personal nature,' Mr Sephton said. 'He visited her house during working hours and had intimate contact with her, meaning he fondled her,' he added. 'Patient A felt uncomfortable about the relationship from the start and put a stop to it. However, Dr Rubin continued to send texts on an occasional basis, again something he has admitted.' But the GP denies that he acted inappropriately during a consultation in July 2012 after Patient A fell off a horse. Mr Sephton said: 'She will tell you Dr Rubin tried to pull her trousers down while she was fighting to keep them up. He was telling her he wanted to check her groin although she could not see why. 'She will tell you he was staring at her underwear, her knickers.' He added: 'Eventually Patient A confided in one of the doctor's partners about what had happened and an investigation was started. 'Dr Rubin phoned Patient A and begged her to withdraw her complaint if not for his sake then for the sake of his child. 'This was a dishonest attempt to gag Patient A from making her complaint.' The hearing, which is expected to last for seven days, continues.

"By . Mark Duell . Britons woke up this morning to find their homes and cars covered in dust from the Sahara Desert. Unusual atmospheric conditions have blown up a sandstorm from Africa - and a thin layer of dust was seen today in areas of southern England including Cornwall and Greater London. The Met Office has forecast a ten out of ten level of air pollution for London for tomorrow and Wednesday, with warnings that the dust will this week cause one of the worst smogs of the year. Scroll down for video . Moving: The dust, shown in pink within the red circle, is carried within clouds, shown in red, to the UK, where it falls within rain showers . In need of a clean: Sahara dust on the Prime Minister's car outside 10 Downing Street in Westminster . Out of Africa: Andy Gunton's car (left) in Hastings, Sussex, and Steve Nash's vehicle (right) in Highworth, Wiltshire, were covered in Sahara dust today . Spotted: 'Dust rain' from the Sahara desert was seen today in Kensington, west London, among other areas . Up high: BBC Weather posted this photograph on Twitter of dust making it onto their rooftop camera at Broadcasting House in London . With such a high level of pollution . expected tomorrow, people with lung problems and the elderly have been . advised to avoid strenuous exercise - and healthy adults told to reduce . exertion outdoors. Steve Nash of Highworth, Wiltshire, was one of many drivers in the UK shocked when they found the residue on their vehicles today. The . 43-year-old said: ‘I'm quite interested in weather and I follow it all . the time, but I have never seen anything like this before. It happened . this afternoon. 'Most . of the cars in the street are also covered in the thin layer of sand. It's amazing when you think about how far it has come.’ From Africa to Britain: A sandstorm over Algeria last week saw sand launched high into the atmosphere . On the continent: Darren Millar's car covered in sand at his home in Le Dorat, western France, after rainfall which brought dust from the Sahara . Met Office forecaster Emma . Sharples . said: ‘This does happen - it has happened before. A 'coincidence of climatic and meteorological influences', according to experts, has led to Saharan sand being whirled high into the sky and whisked across Africa and mainland Europe before coming down. A sandstorm over Algeria last week saw sand launched high into the atmosphere. The Sahara is one of the largest deserts in the world - almost as big as China - and is often battered by strong winds. With the wind currently arriving here from the South/South-East, the conditions were in place to carry that sand over Cornwall. Then, light persistent rain yesterday brought it down to earth. When that rain dried, it left the sand as a visible residue on cars across Cornwall, London, western Wales and Ireland. This sort of weather event happens several times a year, particularly in the summer, according to forecasters. 'But you need the . combination of elements - the sandstorm in the Saharan region, the wind . from the South/South-East, and the right sort of rain. ‘You need a light rain, not too much - . just enough to bring it down and then when it dries out it leaves that . residue on cars. It's probably because the rain is not that heavy that . it does not get brought down and washed off straight away. Of course it . isn't dangerous. ‘The most it's going to be is an inconvenience to people who have it on their clean cars.’ Paul Hutcheon from the Met Office told . the London Evening Standard that this kind of weather event happens . ‘several times a year, particularly in summer when you get these big . dust storms in the western Sahara and the southerly winds to bring that . dust here’. April will kick off tomorrow with temperatures more than five degrees . warmer than average. The hottest day of the year so far is predicted tomorrow or Wednesday. Tomorrow could see a foggy start in central and southern . areas and dull and wet weather in Scotland. But the fog is soon expected to . clear bringing lots of sunshine and warm weather. Laura Young, of the Met Office, said today: ‘We are . expecting a warm week with temperatures at least five degrees above average. Forecast: Temperatures climbed to 20.9C (69.6F) in the South East yesterday and today is expected to be almost as hot. That is compared to Madrid, where it is set to be 14C (57F) and 18C (64F) in Ibiza . ‘We had the hottest day of the year . yesterday when it hit 20.9C in St James's Park in London and we could . see even higher tomorrow or Wednesday. At the moment the weekend is . looking like a mixture of sun and showers.’ 'Because the rain is not that heavy, it does not get brought down and washed off straight away' Emma Sharples, Met Office forecaster . Temperatures climbed to 20.9C (69.6F) in the South East yesterday and today is expected to be almost as hot. That is compared to Madrid, where it is set to be 14C (57F), and 18C (64F) in Ibiza. The sun is set to last all week, but it is expected to cool down before Saturday. The previous highest temperature so far this year was 20.5C (68.9F) in Gravesend, Kent, on March 9. In late March last year, Britain was shivering in snow and temperatures fell to minus 10C (14F). There were drifts as high as 4ft in the North and 20,000 homes lost power.","Unusual atmospheric conditions have blown up sandstorm from Africa .

"By . Charles Sale . Bookmakers Paddy Power will have to examine their flawed publicity strategy after a series of failed stunts caused widespread upset rather than generating interest. Their latest limp effort was hiring a second plane to follow the ‘Moyes out’ flypast over Old Trafford. It carried the message ‘Fergie back in 6-1’, which created little stir and wasn’t considered worthy of comment by United afterwards. This follows Paddy Power’s crass betting market on the Oscar Pistorius murder verdict and sending rainbow laces to football clubs trying to hitch cheap publicity on to the serious anti-homophobia issue. Flawed: Paddy Power flew a plane over Old Trafford home of Manchester United. The banner read 'Fergie Back in 6/1' and it was not well received . Good idea? Paddy Power sent out rainbow boot laces in partnership with gay rights charity Stonewall, to tackle homophobia in football . Tranmere manager Ronnie Moore, suspended . by his club after Sports Agenda revealed he was being investigated by . the FA for betting irregularities, has finally been charged, six weeks . later, for multiple breaches of Rule E8(b) in relation to betting in . competitions involving Tranmere. Paddy boast about having a ‘mischief department’ to dream up their tired ideas, with employee Harry Dromey, son of Labour frontbencher Harriet Harman, even having the title of ‘mischief champion’ on his business card. A spokesman said: ‘We do irritate people, but our ambition is to entertain and the United banner did well on social media, which is what we wanted. We will keep having fun when it works.’ The good news is that Paddy Power are not planning any ambush marketing during this week’s Grand National meeting. Malky Mackay’s £2.5million compensation case against Cardiff is expected to be heard by a Premier League managers’ arbitration tribunal in May if mediation fails. The League Managers Association believe Mackay, who was sacked for ‘imprudent and careless’ management, has a strong case as all his transfers were signed off by the chief executive. Strong case: Malky Mackay will have his case heard against Cardiff later in the year . Cardiff point especially to the failure of £8m striker Andreas Cornelius, who was sold back to FC Copenhagen for a £5m loss after 11 games without scoring. Cornelius is back among the goals.*************************************************The Football League’s annual jolly to Portugal for their summer meeting could be volatile, with a number of Championship teams furious that fines for breaching financial fair play are going to charity rather than being divided among law-abiding clubs. The League say clubs agreed the charity element when they accepted Premier League solidarity payments subsequent to the ballot on financial fair play. ECB’s inside edge ************************************************* . ECB's inside edge . Ashley Giles would be fortunate to be appointed full-time England coach this month, given his woeful record. Nevertheless the interview panel of ECB chief executive David Collier, cricket managing director Paul Downton and Gordon Lord, head of elite coaching development, are likely to favour an insider. Giles hasn’t shown any sign during 17 months in charge of the one-day and T20 sides that he is capable of improving England’s cricketers. But word inside Lord’s is that the ECB would be loath to pick a foreign coach after all the investment in national coaching programmes. Yet someone like Yorkshire’s Australian coach Jason Gillespie appears to have a lot more motivational flair than the wholly uninspiring Giles. Lucky: England coach Ashley Giles has not impressed with the Twenty20 side at the recent tournament . Barnsley may be fighting to avoid relegation from the Championship, but standards at Oakwell are still such that the Kuwaiti ownership group from Nottingham Forest were refused entry to the boardroom because they weren’t wearing ties. The Forest delegation had to go to the club shop to buy suitable neckwear before being allowed in. NBC have followed Manchester City personnel for 36 hours pre-match as part of their 36 series which will be broadcast by ITV on Tuesday. It’s no wonder the Premier League have embraced the arrival of the American network when NBC boss Mark Lazarus told club chairmen it would be a sign of success if they had to double their £200m rights contract in the next tender.

"By . Leon Watson . For 200 years the iconic Natural History Museum in London has put together one of the biggest and most diverse butterfly and moth collections in the world. And now it is putting its incredible collection on show in a special exhibition called Sensational Butterflies. Visitors will see all stages of the butterfly life-cycle in the special enclosure. They will experience the wildly varied environments in which butterflies live in North America, Africa and Asia as well as the heart of the Amazon rainforest in South America, where there are more butterfly species than anywhere else on Earth . Butterflies develop from an egg to a caterpillar before cocooning themselves inside a pupa. They finally emerge as winged adults and set about reproducing. However, butterflies don't survive for long as they cannot eat and can only drink through a straw-like mouth. While this entire cycle only takes 137 days for some species like Blue Morphos, arctic butterflies are believed to have a two-year life cycle. The exhibition, which opens on April 3, also includes two hatchery windows where butterflies will emerge from the pupae, as well as feeding tables.

Ms Zeng spent an hour lying motionless in a coffin decorated with flowers, clutching a Hello Kitty doll to her chest as origami doves hung above the casket. She paid a team of make-up artists who specialise in working on dead bodies to make her look realistic. A man dressed in military uniform stood guard over the 'corpse' as friends and family filed past the coffin during the ceremony in the city of Wuhan. Grief: Friends gathered to mourn for the 'deceased' - who is nonetheless still very much alive . Paying tribute: Friends dutifully filed past the young woman's coffin as she lay there for an hour . 'It struck me that people spend all that time and effort on someone when they are gone and they cannot appreciate it,' she said after the service. 'I wanted to see what people would think of me so I decided to hold my funeral while I could enjoy it.' After lying in state, Ms Zeng jumped out of the coffin and attended her wake, where she delivered a speech. Cute: Ms Zeng's coffine was decorated with flowers, origami birds and a Hello Kitty doll . While the decision to stage her own funeral may be considered bizarre by most, the adventurous woman insists she has no regrets about the experience.

"By . Martin Samuel - Sport . The unstoppable idiot has struck again. There is always a degree of fruitlessness when writing about Michel Platini’s ideas. They are always bad, always to the detriment of football, invariably self-preserving, yet for some reason irresistible. Platini, president of UEFA, is like a monster from a horror film, marching inexorably towards his victims. Nothing can stop him. Not bullets, not fire, not all the weaponry available to mankind; and too few in positions of influence are moved to oppose anyway. His latest plan, arguably his worst yet, was passed unanimously by UEFA’s member nations. The Football Association, the Germans, Dutch, Spanish, French, Italians, countries one might think could be trusted with the future of the international game, all acquiesced, meekly. VIDEO Scroll down to watch UEFA approve new Nations League tournament to replace friendlies . Idiot on board! Michel Platini's newfangled plans are to the severe detriment of  international football . Crazy idea: UEFA are to implement plans for a Nations League to act as further qualification for Euro 2020 . Unbelievable! The changes mean tiny nations like Gibraltar will have a genuine opportunity of qualifying . So, on he goes, lumbering, lurching from side to side, laying waste whatever is in his wake: the European Championship, the UEFA Cup, some of the finest, most competitive leagues in club football. Gone, all gone. Platini sees himself as the game’s great thinker and reformer. He isn’t. He is to football what myxomatosis was to Watership Down; what Dutch elm disease is to Dutch elms. He is the master of misrule, the creator of  mismatches and instigator of tedium, the man who put the World Cup in Qatar and a medal around the neck of Peter Kenyon at the Champions League final. It is hard to think of a more negative influence on the sport in the last 50 years. He inherited competitions that were the pinnacle of football expression, and has ruined them. Platini killed the greatest international football tournament in the world when he increased participation in the European Championship finals from 16 countries to 24. There are 54 member nations of UEFA, meaning it is now almost as hard to get knocked out of the qualification process as it is to go through. With as many as three teams progressing from some groups once the play-offs have taken place, the qualifying stage is dull beyond comprehension. UEFA took over the television rights but — as was predicted the moment the idea was floated — interest in these dead rubbers has flat-lined. Platini (right) has two choices. Admit the scheme was a terrible mistake and abandon it; or plough ahead, piling one bad idea on to another in a desperate bid to shore up interest, and add votes to his next election campaign. No prizes for guessing where this is heading. So here it is. The Nations League. A European Championship within a European Championship, converting friendly football into a mini-league pooled on ability with a sequence of fixtures too complex to consider. All you need to know for now is the bottom line. The winners of each of four divisions will get a wildcard entry to the 2020 European Championship finals. Asking for trouble: The UEFA president's plans are becoming increasingly more bizarre . Delight: Spain won Euro 2012 and will be favourites for the competition in two years' time in France . Strange move: Holland were among the nations to pass Platini's latest plans to overhaul the game . No worries: The Football Association didn't have a problem voting yes in line with other member nations . As the top groups are made up of the likes of Spain, Germany, Holland and Italy, one presumes that is not such a carrot. The major nations will be fairly confident of qualifying via the conventional route, considering all they have to do is finish top two, or maybe three, in a six-team group. Their friendly games will remain little more than, well, friendlies. For the rest, however, it is a lifeline. Another means of remaining ordinary and inadequate and yet still getting a place at the big boys’ table. Each division winner will claim a place, including the bottom one. Now guess who is going to the European Championship finals? Based on current co-efficient rankings, one of the following: Estonia, Georgia, Lithuania, Moldova, Latvia, Luxembourg, Cyprus, Kazakhstan, Malta, Liechtenstein, the Faroe Islands, Andorra, San Marino and Gibraltar. (That’s 14 votes the next time Platini seeks re-election, by the way. The man who brought the big one to Liechtenstein. What’s not to like?) The most recent qualification campaign, for the 2014 World Cup, saw all of those nations in action bar Gibraltar. In total they played 128 games and recorded 13 wins, eight of which involved games against each other. Only Malta’s victory in Armenia, Moldova’s in Montenegro, Cyprus’s win at home to Iceland, Luxembourg’s against Northern Ireland and Georgia’s victory over Belarus were against teams that are not in that dismal last division. The goal difference for the 14 countries was minus 235. And one of them will be going to the 2020 European Championship finals. To think that the tournament used to be . about excellence. To think that what we loved about it was that there . were no gentle looseners, no weak opponents and no chance to play your . way in; hit the ground running, or you were out. At the 2012 tournament, . the Czech Republic, Holland, Denmark, Republic of Ireland and Sweden . all lost first time out. Only the Czechs recovered to make it through. Just a single defeat was also enough to eliminate Russia, Poland and . Croatia. Up there with the best: England are likely to face Europe's top teams in the different format . No problem though? Even if England were to struggle, they'd still be able to qualify in the traditional way . Living in a different world? The changes are said to offer more competitive football instead of friendlies . Are you laughing at me? Platini's plans have been widely derided by the footballing community . Now 16 of 24 qualifiers will reach the final knockout stage and at least one match will involve a meeting with a team from Europe’s bottom 14. How can UEFA have allowed their marquee international competition to be skewed in this way? How have the national associations supported it? All they see is the money. The FA would not have looked beyond those lucrative friendlies at Wembley against Europe’s giants. Other countries do not attract significant crowds to non-competitive fixtures, and are desperate to find a means of making them interesting. They also buy into Platini’s guff that this gives friendly football credibility. In 2012, questioned on the expansion of the European Championship from . 16 to 24 teams, Martin Kallen, UEFA’s chief executive for the 2012 . edition, reeled off a list of names of great teams that were unable to . qualify under the old format. This included Lithuania, who had . somehow contrived to lose to Liechtenstein in the qualifying campaign. Lithuania are currently ranked 105th in the world, which makes them . pretty lousy, but also near the top of UEFA pool four, which runs from . 92nd-ranked Estonia to San Marino in 207th place (Gibraltar have no . ranking as yet). Lithuania would have a reasonable opportunity of . progressing under the 24-team format, rising to a very good chance once . the wildcard entry becomes active. A year ago, however, when I . questioned Platini on Kallen’s words he seemed unimpressed. ‘Why . Lithuania will qualify?’ he asked. I explained. I added that Kallen . counted Lithuania among the great teams who were missing out. ‘Martin . Kallen don’t know nothing about football,’ Platini pouted. Indeed not; . and he would appear to be in good company on that. Huge boost: Lithuania, ranked 105th in the world, will see their chances of progression rocket . UEFA’S new Nations League starts in 2018 and will pave the way for some of the world’s lowest-ranked sides to play at the Euro 2020 finals. HOW WILL IT WORK? The plan is for UEFA’S 54 member teams to be put into four divisions, each containing 12-14 teams. The top-ranked sides will be in Division A and the lowest in Division D. Each division will then be split into four pools of three or four teams. Matches will be played between September and November 2018. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? The winners of the individual pools will then go into their division’s semi-finals and then a final in June 2019. Winners of those finals will qualify for Euro 2020. Based on current world rankings, England would be in Division A with the likes of Spain, Germany and Italy. But Division D, which would get one qualifying place for Euro 2020, contains some of the world’s worst teams. Gibraltar are not a FIFA member and so currently have no world ranking. WHAT ABOUT REGULAR QUALIFICATION? The remaining 20 places for Euro 2020 will be decided via the usual qualifying groups in 2019. If teams qualify both ways, places will go to the team below them in their Nations League division. THE DIVISION D TEAMS (world ranking in brackets) Estonia (92), Georgia (99), Lithuania (105), Moldova (108), Latvia (113), Luxembourg (120), Cyprus (122), Kazakhstan (127), Malta (134), Liechtenstein (151), Faroe Islands (162), Andorra (199), San Marino (207), Gibraltar (N/A)","UEFA president Michel Platini is to implement new Nations League .

"By . Bianca London . From hand-cut fur pom poms to hooded fur gilets, Alexander McQueen's AW14 show was almost entirely made up of the controversial material putting it firmly back on the fashion map for the coming season. Behind the scenes, the fur industry . is fighting back, encouraged, it seems, by fashion's most influential - . such as Kate Moss and Rihanna - who trot out draped in the stuff. So is fur back in fashion and will we all be wearing it come autumn? Apparently so, if the latest figures released by the International . Fur Federation (IFF) are anything to go by. New statistics show that globally, the fur trade is worth £24bn - that's roughly the same as . the global Wi-Fi market - while sales of fur products are estimated at £21.52bn. Back in fashion: Fur, as seen everywhere on Alexander McQueen's AW14 catwalk, is a trade now worth £24bn . And who's to blame? The catwalks, according to Mark Oaten, the CEO of the IFF. 'It's easy to get caught up in . the emotions the business can generate, but the truth is that the fur . trade is an economic cornerstone in Europe and beyond. Much of the . fashion and increasingly the soft furnishings world relies on fur - and . will continue to do so for the foreseeable future,' he said. Speaking to The Telegraph about the news, PETA founder Ingrid E Newkirk said: 'Fur is so cheap these days that furriers have resorted to . paying designers and celebrities to use it, but its cheapness is . reflected in the world of Kardashian freebies and the shallowness of the . wearer.' Designer Sarah Burton, who came to . the attention of the wider public after designing the former Kate . Middleton's wedding dress, set the season's tone by sending . her models down the runway as fairy-tale heroines roaming a . make-believe forest with their fur-embellished gowns trailing behind . them. This is a stark contrast to the late . Eighties when celebrities queued up to express their horror at the . thought of so much as a mink-trimmed cuff. PETA . (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) was born and in 1994 five . supermodels posed nude to protest against wearing fur, along with the . slogan 'I'd rather go naked than wear fur.' This campaign has run and . run and was most recently fronted by Khloe Kardashian. Such . was public disgust, those who did venture out in a pelt were likely to . find themselves splattered with red paint (or a dead raccoon in Anna . Wintour's case). But these good intentions didn't last long and slowly, fur crept back into fashion. While a recent Times News . Service poll found that 95 per cent of British women say they . wouldn't wear fur, the new figures speak for themselves. Wrapping up warm: Supermodel of the moment Cara Delevingne can often be spotted wearing her fur-trimmed hood coat . Change of heart? Naomi Campbell once posed in favour of anti-fur but seems to have changed her mind . Remember when...? Cindy Crawford also seems to be an avid fan of fur goods despite once posing for PETA . Speaking about designers' use of fur, a PETA spokesperson said: 'Fashion designers should be forward-thinking innovators. In contrast, parading animal pelts down the catwalk is simply archaic. 'Stella McCartney, Calvin Klein, Simone Rocha, Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren, Lacoste and Diesel are just some of the designers that shun fur and instead work with luxurious, exciting, sophisticated, cruelty-free fabrics, from metals to spun acrylic and satin, and we hope to see Burton embrace new cutting-edge fabrics that don't bleed. In this day and age, there's absolutely no reason for animals to be killed for fashion.' 'I wonder how many animals had to die for . Rita Ora and Rihanna's wardrobes. They might be chart toppers, but . they're also barbarians' Fashion blogger Simon Glazin was appalled by what he saw on the recent catwalk. He said: 'I actually gasped out loud when I trawled through the catwalk shots from Sarah Burton’s latest McQueen adventure. Not out of joy, but of sheer horror at the amount of fur she decided to use. 'The collection is named ‘Beauty and the Beast’ – but I’m inclined to add an –ly onto the end of the latter. 'The mind boggles. Do these designers just turn a blind eye to the fur industry? Do they just think it happens to fall off the animals in a glorious, gift-giving way like apples dropping from their branches? 'I realise there are those customers who demand fur, who love to wrap themselves up in the stuff, but it’s down to the labels and editors (yes, you Anna Wintour!) to stop this happening. You can do glamour without skinning foxes and mink alive – just look to Stella McCartney or brilliant faux fur label, Shrimps. I imagine if these fashion houses decided to turn around imitation fur pieces too, they’d sell like hotcakes. Fur, fur, everywhere: The collection is named 'Beauty and the Beast' - but I'm inclined to add an -ly onto the end of the latter, says Simon Glazin . 'You can bet your bottom dollar that the Duchess of Cambridge won’t be seen in any furry Alexander McQueen creations, she might even stay clear of the label altogether now. And I wouldn’t blame her. Mr and Mrs Kim Kardashian love a bit of fur, and I wonder how many animals had to die for Rita Ora and Rihanna’s wardrobes. They might be chart toppers, but they’re also barbarians.' Celebrity stylist Alex Longmore added: 'Unfortunately, It does not surprise me one bit that there is fur on the McQueen catwalk. It's everywhere and is not just reserved for autumn. This SS14, Louis Vuitton have shaved mink dresses and the Fendi catwalk is full of fur - and that’s for the hot summer months! 'Gone are the days of supermodels posing for anti-fur campaigns with slogans such as ""I'd rather go naked than wear fur"". Once upon a time fur was deemed non-PC but now that rule has been totally sidelined. Fur seems to have been made not only fashionable but to be the ultimate in luxury by the design houses. Big fan: Rihanna has no qualms about her penchant for fur coats and often sports fur stoles too . Generation cruel? Liberty Ross, Kate Moss and Kim Kardashian have all been spotted wearing fur coats - even though Kim's sister Khloe is the face of PETA's anti-fur campaign . 'As a passionate animal lover, I find this very hard to stomach. I find it absolutely shocking that fur is being so accepted and is now trimmed on nearly every parka or winter coat you see on the high street. 'There are some seriously good faux fur available now, especially from Shrimps (sold on Avenue 32) which is the ultimate in cool and doesn’t hurt a soul. Of course it doesn’t help that celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, Kate Moss and Beyonce wear fur. 'If only they could see how it doesn’t need to be real to be on trend - see how good Laura Bailey and Fearne Cotton look - you can't even tell it isn't the real thing.' Encouragingly, several industry heavyweights all refuse to use fur in their collections. Stella McCartney is one designer for . whom pelts just don't pay, telling Grazia that: 'everything in my store . and every single garment and accessory that you see is cruelty free in . the sense that no animal has died to make anything in here.' And . she's not alone. Sir Philip Green's Arcadia Group, which includes . Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins, as well as All Saints, Vivienne . Westwood, Calvin Klein, H&M, Selfridges, Harvey Nichols and Liberty . have all pledged not to sell fur. Even prestigious Mayfair haunt and celebrity nightspot Mahiki has vowed to turn away anyone wearing fur at the door - proving that you can have a look that . kills without killing animals.

"By . Luke Garratt . Eating organic food does nothing to cut a woman's risk of cancer, a new study has found. Women who always ate organic fruit and vegetables over a period of nine years were no less likely to develop one of of 16 types of cancer than those who never ate that type of foods. In fact, scientists actually found there was a small increased risk of breast cancer in those who only ate organic, according to Oxford University's Million Women study. Organic foods have been found to not help in the fight against cancer . Many people turn to organic food because they believe it is healthier and because they want to avoid pesticide contamination, which many believe increases the cancer risk. But when researchers looked at cancers specifically linked to pesticides, such as breast cancer and soft tissue cancers, they found no evidence of increased risks. Many scientists who worked on the study believe any reduction or increase in the threat is probably the result of other factors. Researchers asked 600,000 women aged 50 or over whether they ate organic food and monitored their health for nine years. In total, around 50,000 of the women developed one of 16 of the most common cancers during the study period. The scientists conducted their study with 600,000 women over a period of nine years, examining how many women developed cancer in that time - and how many of those chose organic over non-organic . But a comparison between 180,000 women who never ate organic food and 45,000 who 'usually' or 'always' chose the products found no difference in the overall risk. A reduction in the risk of the blood cancer non-Hodgkin lymphoma was also linked to eating organic, but scientists said this could be due to other factors, or just chance. Professor Tim Key, a Cancer Research UK-funded scientist at Oxford University, said: 'In this large study of middle-aged women in the UK we found no evidence that a woman's overall cancer risk was decreased if she generally ate organic food. 'More research is needed to follow-up our findings of a possible reduction in risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.' There are concerns that widely used pesticides might increase cancer risk, but so far the evidence has been inconclusive. In addition to the scientific findings, the Food Standards Agency have previously said that eating organic food does not provide any significant nutritional benefit over non-organic food . Conventionally grown fruit and vegetables contain very small pesticide residues. The new findings appear in the British Journal of Cancer, which is owned by Cancer Research UK. Dr Claire Knight, the charity's health information manager, said: 'This study adds to the evidence that eating organically grown food doesn't lower your overall cancer risk. 'But if you're anxious about pesticide residues on fruit and vegetables, it's a good idea to wash them before eating. 'Scientists have estimated that over 9% of cancer cases in the UK may be linked to dietary factors, of which almost 5% are linked to not eating enough fruit and vegetables. 'So eating a well-balanced diet which is high in fruit and vegetables - whether conventionally grown or not - can help reduce your cancer risk.' Peter Melchett of the Soil Association told The Times the researchers were too quick to dismiss the idea that organic food is linked to non-Hodgkin lymphoma, saying pesticides can find their way into soils where organic foods grow. He said: 'They have a poor understanding of what pesticides are found in and how pesticides get into food.'","Organic food is the choice of many wanting to avoid pesticides .
Oxford University study says the food types have no impact on cancer .
Researchers also found no increased risk of cancers linked to pesticides .

"By . Emma Innes . Scientists believe they have found an alternative to surgery for women with the so-called 'breast cancer gene'. Angelina Jolie had a mastectomy after learning she had the faulty gene . When a woman is told she has the so-called ‘breast cancer gene’ she currently faces a stark choice – to have her breasts and ovaries removed or face the terrifyingly high risk of cancer. But now, researchers in Belfast believe they have come up with an alternative. The scientists say women with the BRCA1 gene mutation could use drugs, which are already available, to reduce their risk of the disease. In the UK, about one woman in every 1,000 has the BRCA1 mutation – the same gene fault that prompted Angelina Jolie to undergo a double mastectomy. These women have up to an 85 per cent chance of developing breast cancer and up to a 40 per cent chance of ovarian cancer. Until now, surgery to remove the breasts and ovaries has been their only option. However, researchers at Queen’s University, Belfast, now say drug treatments which lower levels of oestrogen could also reduce cancer risks. Their research revealed that there is a direct link between high levels of oestrogen and DNA damage, which causes cancer, in the breasts and ovaries. The scientists also found that the cells of women with the BRCA1 mutation cannot effectively fight the very high levels of oestrogen that exist in all women’s breasts and ovaries, leaving them vulnerable to DNA damage. Dr Kienan Savage, who led the research, said: ‘This discovery is very significant in the management of women with the BRCA1 gene mutation. ‘It’s the first really credible evidence that oestrogen is driving cancer in women with a BRCA1 gene mutation. ‘Because of this discovery, we now have the opportunity to propose an alternative treatment to surgery. ‘It also opens up the possibility of pausing treatment for a period in order for women to have children, if desired.’ Scientists say taking anti-oestrogen drugs could reduce the risk of cell damage, and therefore tumours, in people with the BRCA1 gene mutation. This is because these women's cells are unable to cope with high levels of the hormone. Angelina Jolie is pictured with partner, Brad Pitt . He added: ‘What also makes this exciting is that there are drugs already on the market which turn off oestrogen production. ‘In theory, we could use these drugs to chemically reduce oestrogen production in women which could negate the need for irreversible surgery.’ The researchers are currently seeking funding to launch clinical trials and hope to do so within 12 months. It is envisaged that, in the first instance, a small control trial will be carried out using a combination of two drugs on 12 women for a period of three months, using biopsy, blood and urine samples to track DNA damage.","Women with the BRCA1 mutation have up to an 85% risk of breast cancer .

The Queen, dressed in almost . top to toe in white, pulled a rope to remove a . large purple cloth that had been draped over the artwork and 400 people . watching from behind barriers gave a cheer. The . monarch's choice of outfit meant she matched the white blossom in bloom along the . The Long Walk, Windsor, and stood out amongst the vibrant daffodils. She wore a long coat over a dress in the same pale . shade and matching hat. She added some contrast to the outfit with black . gloves, handbag and shoes that matched the dark buttons on her coat. Prince Philip and Prince William, who looked to be sharing a joke during part of the proceedings, were also in attendance. It was one of a few times when the Duke of Cambridge has joined his grandmother and grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, at a public event.

The statue was created in bronze by sculptor Robert Rattray and is based on Daniel and Storm, two horses stabled at the Royal Mews. They are regularly used to draw the monarch's carriage during events ranging from Trooping the Colour to Royal Ascot. After the artist Mr Rattray had chatted to the Queen he said: 'I think she was pleased with it - I hope she was. We were talking about how it was made - it was made in sections - she was interested in the technicalities of the work.' The royal couple waved as they were driven to the venue .

The statue is based on Daniel and Storm, two horses stabled at the Royal Mews . The sculpture is a tribute from the people of Windsor who wanted to mark the 60th anniversary of the Queen's Coronation, celebrated last year, and commemorate the contribution Windsor Greys have made to the ceremonial life of the nation. After an appeal was started to raise money for the project William agreed to become its patron. The Duke of Cambridge today joked about his role in a project declaring he had his arm ""twisted"". William made the light-hearted quip after Rosemary Ussher, who led the appeal to raise funds for the project, told supporters and trustees that the Duke's support was ""a great morale booster"". Prince William looked dapper in a blue suit and lighter blue tie as he attended to support his grandmother without wife Kate and son Prince George. Yesterday, a picture was released on the Duchess of Cambridge's first Mother's Day showing the new parents with their eight-month-old and pet dog Lupo at their home in Kensington Palace.

"By . Bianca London . Beyonce, Cara Delevingne, Ellie Goulding and Rita Ora have many things in common: fame, fortune and fashion credentials. They also share a love of an up-and-coming streetwear design duo who, until now, were an unknown brother and sister crafting clothes from their University bedrooms. Meet Jaded London - the label set to take the nation's wardrobes by storm. Hot new designer: Jaded London is an urban streetwear brand loved by the likes of Rita Ora (left) and Ellie Goulding that is set for huge success . Jade and Grant Goulden founded Jaded London in the summer of 2013. Inspired by global street style from East London, LA and New York, the creators set about designing their own take on urban streetwear - and the A-listers can't get enough. In the past month, Cara, Ellie, Rita and even Beyonce have been spotted sporting the sibling's designs, something they find hard to comprehend. Speaking to FEMAIL about her overnight success, 25-year-old Jade said: 'I feel overwhelmed by the reaction the brand has had but it hasn’t quite sunk in yet especially when I see people walking down the street wearing Jaded London.' Speaking about the history of the brand, which is now stocked in high street mecca Topshop, Jade said: 'We set up Jaded London in the Summer of 2013. After two successful years working at ASOS I decided to use the business skills I had learned, and my commercial eye, to take a big risk and start my own label. A-list fan: Beyonce purchased one of Jade's tees during her trip to Topshop in London while on her Mrs Carter world tour . Brains behind the brand: Grant and Jade Goulden, who come from a fashion obsessed family, started the brand last summer . 'My family have worked in the fashion industry for three generations so I have grown up around the business and learnt the trade from my father. 'I saw the growth in the market for streetwear so decided to develop an exciting range for a young demographic. My brother Grant graduated university at the same time, he has a far better knowledge than me of men's fashion and trends so we decided to work together to develop a unisex brand. 'He looks after menswear, which is stocked in Topman and River Island and I look after womenswear sold in Topshop, Selfridges and Urban Outfitters; we have a great working relationship.' Jade, who describes the range as 'premium streetwear', says she was inspired by the catwalk trend for sports luxe, which was seen everywhere from Christopher Kane to Ashish. Urban cool: The range embraces the hot sports luxe trend and incorporates bright colours, bold prints and slouchy styles . Boys and girls: Grant looks after the menswear side, which is stocked at the likes of Topman, while Jade heads up the womenswear (left, shirt, £50, and, right, skirt, £40) 'We are developing a handwriting style where people can instantly recognise a Jaded London print,' she said. 'We don't just focus on streetwear, we also produce a lot of going out dresses and glam co-ords. Jaded is a reactive brand as we have a very quick supply chain so we continuously adapt to current trends. 'I think the sports luxe trend will stick around as even the big fashion houses like Chanel are using streetwear as a main focus to their fashion shows and collections.' The young designers are already looking to branch out and have their sights set on launching swimwear and festival rain macs this summer and would one day love to develop a Jaded perfume or make-up range. Famous fans: Ellie, who has been sporting a new signature style lately, is a huge fan of the brand, while Cara Delevingne has worn it too (right) Ambitious Jade - who managed to get her range into Topshop simply by 'emailing the buying team not thinking I would have a response at such an early stage' - said of her celebrity fans: 'Beyonce actually bought the Diamond crop sweat and the Honeycomb skirt herself when Topshop shut down the store for her. 'Ellie Goulding also purchased the Violet Swirl tee when shopping in Urban Outfitters. It is crazy to think they are buying the product for themselves rather than under a stylist's influence.' Jade, who would love to see Rihanna, Kayne West and Pharrel Williams wearing her designs, says you don't need to be an A-list to pull off her clothes, which are priced between £30-£65. 'We love seeing customers style the Jaded look themselves and posting pictures on Instagram. A lot of people are daring enough to wear the matching co-ords but others style with jeans and plainer tees,' she said.","Jaded London started by Jade and Grant Goulden .

"By . Emma Innes . Everyone knows that too much sunbathing can cause skin cancer. But now research suggests that, in moderation, sunbathing could actually be good for people’s health. A new study has revealed that it could prevent heart attacks. Sunbathing could reduce the risk of heart attacks, new research suggests . It shows that cardiovascular disease is more severe in patients deficient in vitamin D, known as the 'sunshine vitamin'. Although people are advised not to overdo it because of the risk of skin cancer, the latest finding backs up previous studies suggesting sunshine is good for the heart. In the largest analysis to date, vitamin D deficiency was identified in seven in ten patients undergoing coronary angiography - an imaging test used to see how blood flows through the arteries in the heart. It was associated with higher prevalence of coronary artery disease, with a 32 per cent higher occurrence in those with the lowest levels. There were also almost 20 per cent more severe cases affecting multiple vessels among those with less of the nutrient. A progressive increase in heart disease was found according to the severity of vitamin D deficiency. People who are deficient in the sunshine vitamin - vitamin D - are more likely to have severe coronary artery disease . Patients with the lowest levels of vitamin D had nearly double the rate of clogged arteries as those with normal levels. Cardiologist Dr Monica Verdoia, of Eastern Piedmont University in Novara, Italy, said: ‘Present results suggest vitamin D deficiency to be the cause rather than the consequence of hardening of the arteries. ‘Although evidence of benefits with vitamin D supplementation in cardiovascular outcomes are still lacking, strategies to raise natural vitamin D should probably be advised in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.’ Presenting her work to an American College of Cardiology meeting in Washington, she said vitamin D deficiency is an independent risk factor for heart disease. But it is still not clear whether adding vitamin D supplements may help reduce that risk. Her researchers evaluated amounts of the nutrient in 1,484 patients who were considered to have heart disease. The extent and severity of their heart disease was measured by a scanning procedure that determines the degree of artery blockage. Dr Verdoia said eating foods rich in vitamin D such as fish, cereal and eggs and moderate exercise outdoors should be advised in healthy people as well as those with heart disease. This is because the nutrient boosts the immune system as well as reducing inflammatory processes that lead to illness. The researchers estimate more than half of U.S. adults are vitamin D deficient, with the highest rates among African Americans and Hispanics. In the UK vitamin D deficiency is likely to affect at least half of white adults, up to 90 per cent of the multi ethnic population and a quarter of all children. Vitamin D is being studied for its possible connection to several diseases and health problems including diabetes, high blood pressure, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune conditions, bone disorders and some types of cancer.","Vitamin D could be good for heart health, a new study has revealed .

"By . Adam Crafton . So, here we are again. You may recognise it well, for it is just as we were last week. Another moment of respite, another blanket over the flames engulfing Old Trafford. Once more, the green shoots of recovery spring up and the lonely occasion creates a world of possibilities in the mind of David Moyes. It was all there again for the Manchester United manager on Saturday lunchtime. As insipid and anaemic as his side were against Liverpool and Manchester City, so they were incisive and cavalier here against Aston Villa. As the precocious teen Adnan Januzaj decorated this United victory with a glorious assist for Javier Hernandez late on, it almost felt an illusion that the talk of this past week had been that Moyes could be approaching the end game as Bayern Munich arrive at Old Trafford on Tuesday evening. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Moyes, the banner and Bayern's weekend highlights . Acknowledgment: Manchester United manager David Moyes applauds the crowd after beating Aston Villa . Certainly, this was far more like it from United. Juan Mata scored his first goal in a red jersey, Shinji Kagawa finally provided some indication as to what all the fuss is about and Wayne Rooney was immense yet again, looking every inch the United captain-in-waiting. At this moment in time, Wayne Rooney is Manchester United. United without Rooney would be like Gladiator without Russell Crowe. Rooney has rediscovered his love for the game, charging around, all muscle and deftness. At times, it seems he is on a personal mission to keep his manager on-board. Unfortunately, though, it is not on the basis of games at home to Aston Villa that David Moyes will be judged. Handsome victories over the lesser lights are taken as red in these parts, par for the course, one to tick off the list in the pursuit of grander occasions. Deadly: Wayne Rooney scored a double as United beat Villa 4-1 at Old Trafford on Saturday . At the very least, this was an afternoon of relief for David Moyes. This result stills some of the squalls around him and provided a timely riposte to the crass aeroplane stunt that undermined the vast majority of Manchester United supporters who have, for the most part, been generous in their backing of Moyes this season. Time, however, is devoured extraordinarily quickly in football these days and with the words 'Wrong One - Moyes Out' emblazoned in red letters across the Old Trafford skyline, this became a day of some significance for the United manager. There have been times this season when it has seemed as though United have turned so many corners that they have gone full circle and Saturday marked another of those 'Is this the day it all changes?' junctures for the imperilled United manager. Up in the air: A plane flew over Old Trafford displaying an anti-Moyes banner during the match . The problem for Manchester United under David Moyes is that their hot streaks last only until the next challenging fixture. The month of March has offered a fitting snapshot of United's curious season. A 3-0 win at West Bromwich Albion was followed by a 3-0 defeat at home to Liverpool. Optimism was garnered by victories over Olympiacos and West Ham but the air swiftly went out of the balloon with the midweek capitulation against Manchester City. Saturday yielded another of these rosier days but the next dose of reality is expected when Bayern Munich arrive at Old Trafford and there is little reason to expect that this fluctuating script will deviate any time soon. Support: Moyes received a hug from a United supporter as he arrived in the dugout ahead of the match . Following United under David Moyes has become a life of extremes and too often the air of renewal has proved deceptive. The David Moyes 'Hokey-Cokey' is starting to become a weekly occurrence in these parts. In, out, they shake him all about. For now, the rank-and-file have settled down and while the Stretford Enders wonder privately - and my, how they do - there was no voluble mutiny on this occasion. Winning helps, of course. From plane spotting to plain-sailing, this was a day of appeasement but these United supporters have seen enough false starts this season to be taken in by a victory over Aston Villa. In truth, Paul Lambert's side, just like Olympiacos ten days earlier, were generous opponents for a side teetering on the brink. Moyes will be only too aware that radical improvement is required if United are to challenge Bayern Munich in the Champions League. United's record in the defining matches this season has been appalling. In 13 matches against sides in the top nine of the Barclays Premier League, United have won just one. Tough test: German champions Bayern Munich are United's next opponents on Tuesday . Moyesâ€™ warning to Pep Guardiola's all-conquering team that â€˜Old Trafford is not an easy place to comeâ€™ is rather undermined by a home record that is equal to Norwich City and only one point better off than those of Hull City and Crystal Palace. The statistics are jaw-dropping. United have failed to win nine of their sixteen Premier League assignments at Old Trafford. Chelsea, Manchester City, Liverpool, Everton and Newcastle United have all kept clean sheets at Old Trafford and four of those teams won without reply. A cursory glance at the teams United have beaten in the Premier League this season only hastens the conclusion that United are little more than flat-track bullies: Swansea City, Crystal Palace, Sunderland, Stoke City, Fulham, Arsenal, Aston Villa, West Ham, Hull City, Norwich City, Cardiff City and West Bromwich Albion. Struggles: Moyes looked dejected as his side crashed to a 3-0 defeat at home to City on Tuesday . This United squad may be packed with serial winners but their manager appears to suffer from a conviction deficit disorder in the biggest games. The major holes in his CV are yet to be patched up. It is now 49 Premier League away games as the opposing manager at Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United that Moyes has failed to win a football match. There has been an apathy in these season-defining matches that goes against all we expect from a Manchester United team. Not only has the swagger disappeared but so too has that obstinacy, that refusal to wither, that rejection of defeat. United have fallen behind on sixteen occasions this season and only four times have they recovered to win. Watching on: Former manager Sir Alex Ferguson watches United beat Villa from the stands at Old Trafford . Against Bayern, United must recover their old identity, stop playing chess and as the ditty goes, excite the fans with 'football taught by Matt Busby'. Moyes' side must shed their inhibitions and display the kind of character and nerve that is considered mandatory by those who come through the turnstiles. Moyes talks wistfully of the plans he is busy formulating for the long-term at Old Trafford but he will know deep down that football is also about the here and now, the next 90 minutes. There may be a masterplan in place behind-the-scenes but for the time being, the supporters require one of those magical nights at Old Trafford to escape the despondency and to reconnect, however briefly, with the fluency and majesty of the Ferguson years. Tuesday against Bayern Munich would be a fine time to shine. Message: The Chosen One banner continues to hang at the Stretford End despite Moyes' recent woes .","One win in 13 against the top nine sides .
All very well beating Aston Villa but a Manchester United can never be judged on a victory over a mid-table side .
Moyes says 'Old Trafford is not an easy place to come' - United's home record equal to Norwich and Newcastle - failed to win nine of 16 .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . They say a brand can live or die by its name, and Alexandra Watkins, a San Francisco native and professional wordsmith, has found she has an unusual talent for finding just the right ones. The Californian-born former ad copywriter owns her own company, Eat My Words, whose clients pay her up to $50,000 a pop to come up with catchy new names for their products. Ms Watkins has generated thousands of names for snacks, software, sunscreen, social networking sites, sportswear, serums, and seafood (and that’s just the S’s!) for companies including Dunkin' Donuts, Disney, Microsoft and Proactiv. Word wizard: Alexandra Watkins, pictured, is paid up to $50,000 for coming up with names for products including snacks, sunscreen, social networking sites and serums . A former copywriter for Ogilvy, the ad agency giant responsible for clients including Google and Ikea to name but a few, Ms Watkins quit writing ads and 'turned in her corporate American Express card' nine years ago to start the company of her dreams, scoring her first major client via a Match.com date. So why are companies willing to pay so much for a few or even just one word? 'A name will last longer than any other investment you make in your business,' Ms Watkins tells MailOnline. 'It makes a critical first impression. Even more than your shoes.' Where the magic happens: Ms Watkins works out her colorful San Francisco office, pictured, and is renowned for creating catchy names that 'make you smile, not scratch your head' And she has a point. It may only be a . carbonated drink, but Coca-Cola, for example, is the number one most . recognized word in the world, second only to 'Hello'. And though many seasoned marketers agonize for months over what to name a new drink, burger or nail polish shade, Ms Watkins, whose prices start at $15,000, says: 'I can do it with my eyes closed,' before adding, 'Honestly, writers block has never happened to me.' It generally takes around three weeks of working with a client and bouncing ideas around before Eat My Words settles on the right name and cashes the hefty check, although Ms Watkins claims the perfect name can often hit her straight away. Food for thought: Most of the company's first clients were products that make people 'fat and drunk,' including Dunkin' Donuts . 'Even if we do think of the perfect name right off the bat, we still do a full exploration, just to be sure we are right,' she points out. The name for her own company came to her 'a flash,' she says, noting that many of her first clients were food and beverage companies. 'I started out naming things that make people fat and drunk,' she remarks, so Eat My Words seemed like a perfect fit. What's in a name? Ms Watkins, who also counts Proactiv as a client, claims she is enthusiastic 'even about the driest products' Ms Watkins explains that there are several common mistakes people make when naming their products. 'Names that aren't spelled the way they sound are frustrating for customers,' she says, 'As well as names that are meaningful to you but not your audience.' She gives poorly-conceived names including SmolkSignal, Xboni and Squrl as examples. As for products she has crowned with great names, there's I Have A Bean for a coffee company, Mixin' Vixen' for an all-female bar tending service, Stuff A Sock In It for a chain of laundromats and Hand Job for a male-friendly nail salon. Ms Watkins is unable to disclose some of . the more famous brands she has worked her magic with, including a . nationally recognized bacon cheeseburger, whose parent company would . perhaps rather not reveal where some of its brightest ideas came from. Around a quarter of her projects are made up of renaming existing products that are in need of a makeover. Ms Watkins recounts influencing a 25% jump in revenue for a hotel's wedding business, simply by changing up the 'ho-hum' names for their services to ones that are more 'emotionally engaging.' 'A name makes a critical first impression. Even more than your shoes.' The hotel's Rehearsal Dinner service is now Meet the Parents, their Post-Reception Bar Rental is now Last Call for Alcohol and their Post-Wedding Brunch is now aptly named Bloody Married. The word wizard, who works out of a jazzy office in San Francisco’s SoMa district, more reminiscent of a Disney house than a thriving marketing agency, claims she is always enthusiastic, 'even about the driest products' and, at the end of the day, operates by her philosophy that a name should 'make you smile, not scratch your head.' She is currently writing a book on naming called Hello, My Name is Awesome - How to Create Brand Names that Stick, for those who want great names but can't afford her services, which will be released in September.","Alexandra Watkins counts Dunkin' Donuts, Disney, Microsoft and Proactiv amongst her many clients ."
"By . Sean Poulter . People who download the appwill receive information on what outfit the model is wearing, the prices and how it might be teamed with accessories . Mannequins are to be fitted with beacons which allow them to ‘talk’ to the smartphones of shoppers. People who download the app for the service will receive information on their smartphone on just what outfit the model is wearing, the prices and how it might be teamed with accessories. Regular customers might be offered a personal discount on the dress on display by way of a loyalty reward, or they would be able to share the images with friends to get advice on whether to buy. While they can also store the information on their phone to think about it and buy later from the retailer’s website. The VMBeacon system has been developed by the British technology and design company Iconeme and is the latest evidence as to how technology and smartphones are changing the way people shop. The beacons installed inside the mannequins have a range of 100 metres and a battery life of three years and so can communicate with shoppers even when stores are closed. The idea of having a virtual conversation with mannequins has echoes of Dr Who, where the idea of shop dummies that come to life has featured several times over the decades. The theme was first used in episodes in 1970 when the doctor, who was played by Jon Pertwee, came up against the Autons or Nestenes. The episode caused great controversy at the time with complaints it was too frightening for children. Many fans will remember the character Rose, played by Billie Piper, being pursued by mannequins when the series was revived in 2005 and featured Christopher Eccleston as the doctor. The Iconeme founders are Jonathan Berlin and Adrian Coe, who together have over 50 years’ experience in the retail industry, working with famous name fashion chains.

Mr Berlin said: ‘A recent Google report revealed that 84per cent of smartphone shoppers use their devices to help them browse while in a store. The technology we have developed aims to tap into this trend and offers real value to both retailers and consumers. ‘The Internet of Things and beacon technology has been gaining momentum over the last few years but we are yet to see its practical and widespread use in retail outlets. Installing this technology in mannequins ensures it occupies a prime location and an ideal focus-point for shoppers, whether they are in the store itself or just passing by the window.’ Another British company has developed a similar technology called the PowaTag, which is a smart tag that is used in TV commercials, window displays and print advertisements. The shopper uses their smartphone to take a picture of the tag and an associated App then links to the store’s website to allow an instant purchase. The British tech firm Powa Technologies has already signed up 240 global brands from Adidas and Reebok, to Universal Music and the world’s second largest supermarket group, Carrefour.

"By . Mark Prigg . Amazon is set to unveil its plans for a TV set top box next week, it has been claimed. The firm has sent invites promising an 'updates on its video business' at an event in New York on 2nd April. It follows rumours to firm has been racing to beat Apple to the lucrative TV set top box market. Amazon.com founder and chief executive officer Jeff Bezos with the firm's Kindle tablets. It is set to announce a TV set top box next week. Amazon's invite to its TV event . The so-called 'Kindle TV' service has been discussed with at least three major media companies, according to reports. The service is expected to combine live TV with Amazon's existing Prime TV and film on demand service. Amazon already offers on-demand TV shows and movies free to customers who are members of Amazon's premium shipping service Prime, in both the UK and US. It is believed the service could use a low cost box similar to Roku's, or Apple's TV box, according to the Wall Street Journal. Earlier reports claim the set-top box is being developed by Amazon’s Lab126 division in Cupertino, close to Apple's campus, and is being run by Malachy Moynihan, a former vice president of emerging video products at Cisco who also worked for Apple. It comes as Amazon has been ramping up its video content. Amazon invested about $1 billion in content in 2013, according to Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Youssef Squali. Last year it introduced 14 televisions pilots, which it financed, and is now monitoring customer feedback to decide which ones to produce as full series. The Amazon shows included Alpha House, starring John Goodman, the Hollywood actor known for his roles in The Big Lebowski and Argo. Bill Murray, of Ghostbusters and Groundhog Day, also appears. Alpha house, starring John Goodman (second left) is one of Amazon's latest TV shows. The firm is expected to reveal a set top box next week. Roy Price, director of Amazon Studios, the unit that is creating the shows, said: ‘I think the distinction between a regular TV show and an online TV show will soon fade away. ‘It just makes sense that if you’re trying to decide what TV show to make, it might be a good idea to ask customers which one they like.’ Each pilot is available on Amazon Instant Video or Lovefilm for free, with viewer feedback deciding which show will get a full series order from the company. The company has also paid to secure exclusive streaming rights to hit shows such as Downton Abbey. The firm also recently acquired video studio Double Helix Games,. fuelling rumours the box could double as a games console.. Amazon already has its own studio, developing games for iOS and Android gadgets, and this acquisition suggests the firm is looking to expand this part of the business further. TechCrunch discovered leaked details about the acquisition earlier this week and Amazon has since confirmed it bought the company as part of its 'ongoing commitment to build innovative games for customers.' Following reports last week Amazon is working on games console, the retail giant, pictured, has fuelled these rumours by acquiring Double Helix Games. Amazon already has it own games studio and the acquisition suggests the firm is looking to expand this part of the business further . Double Helix Games was set up in 2007 following a merger between studios, The Collective and Shiny Entertainment. Previous to that the firms had been respectively building games since the mid-1990s. Recent titles produced by Double Helix Games include G.I Joe: The Rise of Cobra, and Silent Hill: Homecoming. The firm is based in Irvine, California and employs 75 people. Rumours about an impending games console were reported last week by gaming blog VG24/7. The 'gaming and entertainment device' is set to cost $300 (£180) and will run on Android. It is expected to go on sale later this year. Any games console Amazon makes will directly compete with the likes of Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft. The company is also starting from an established base of more than 200 million customers, and already has a strong software base, with its Amazon store, alongside hardware such as the Kindle e-reader, and the Kindle range of tablets. After selling games on its App Store, Amazon decided to set up its own studio called Amazon Games Studios in 2012. It . launched a Facebook game called Living Classics, which was pulled from . the site in October last year. Current games include flying game Air . Patriots, available for Apple and Android devices. If . Amazon doesn't launch a console, it could be looking to use Double . Helix's expertise to enhance the successes of this studio.

"By . David Mccormack . The grieving husband who paid for a young couple’s dinner last week because they reminded him of his recently deceased wife has modestly described his kindhearted act as really a 'selfish' gesture so he would feel better. Lee Ballantyne, who lost his wife of 43 years to cancer on December 30, was dining alone in Chico’s, an Italian restaurant in Barrie, Ontario, when he spotted the young couple - he hasn't revealed their name - who caused him to reminisce about the good times with his late wife Carol. Ballantyne, 65, told Mail Online that he has been ‘astonished’ by the overwhelming response to his actions last Tuesday night which he said he did to try and make himself feel better. Lee Ballantyne, the grieving husband who paid for a young couple's dinner last week in Barrie, Ontario, because they reminded him of his recently deceased wife Carol, has modestly described his kind-hearted act as a 'selfish' gesture so he would feel better . ‘I believe my gesture of paying the bill was selfish on my part. I wanted to feel good, and I did,’ he explained. Ballantyne was the only customer in the restaurant at the time when the couple came in and sat two tables away from him. He admits to conflicting emotions at seeing two people so clearly in love and enjoying each other’s company. ‘Watching them smile and chat as they studied the menu at first made me envious. 'But the longer I watched, the more I came to realize they are on the same journey as Carol and I experienced over the years. And they seem to be assured of many happy times along the way.’ As . well as paying for their meal, Lee wrote the couple a touching note on a napkin. Ballantyne was dining alone at Chico's, an Italian restaurant in Barrie, when he spotted the young couple who caused him to reminisce about the good times with his late wife . Carol Ballantyne, who was 62, died over the holidays after being diagnosed with lung cancer in September and a long battle with Lupus . ‘You don't know me, but my beautiful . wife of 43 years died last week. Tonight I dined alone for the first . time. You remind me of us many years ago. Please allow me to buy your . dinner. It will put a smile on Carol's face and make me happy... for . now,’ he wrote. The grateful young couple managed to track Ballantyne down via their waitress and called him later that night. Ballantyne has refused to reveal who they are, 'it's a private moment between us,' he has said. But he did reveal that they’ve promised to take him out to dinner to pay him back for his act of kindness. Tarik Topic, a bartender at Cicco’s, was working on the night when the 'private' moment occurred and told Mail Online that the woman cried when staff told them that Ballantye had picked up their tab. He described the mystery couple as being in their early 30s and said they had a young daughter, less than five-year-old, along with them. Initially Ballantye's waitress wasn’t sure what he wanted her to do but when he explained that it was a Pay It Forward courtesy all the staff felt ‘very touched by the heartfelt gesture’. Lee Ballantyne was grieving for his late wife Carol, but after seeing two young people so clearly in love at a local Italian restaurant he decided to pay their bill to feel better and so left them the note below... Ballantyne's oldest son Jason, 41, . recalls that his father has always been a generous tipper and that it is . one of the few things that ‘used to drive mum nuts.’ ‘He . would always look to give 25-30 percent and she would always tease him . and say “Maybe the service wasn’t that great,”’ recalls Jason who, along . with his wife and daughter, lives just minutes from his father in . Barrie. As the eldest son, Jason feels a . sense of responsibility to look out for his dad now that he is living . alone, but he has also told his father that he isn’t going to be calling . him all the time to check that he’s alright. ‘I’ve told him he has a standing invite any time he wants to come and see my family,’ said Jason. He . also said his father is coping as well as can be expected since his . wife Carol passed away last month, that he is keeping busy and has had . lots of support from colleagues and friends. Jason . told Mail Online that the family have been very encouraged by the . feedback they've received since news of his father touching gesture was . reported in the media - and that it is a fitting tribute to his mom, who . died last month. Happy family: Lee Ballantyne, pictured top right, with his late wife Carol, has three sons - including Jason, top left, and five grandchildren . ‘It . is nice that a lot of people now know about mom. She wasn’t a celebrity . or a politician, she lived a simple life, as a housewife and a mother. As I told my daughter this is how we keep her memory alive,’ he said. According to Jason, his mother labored most of her adult life with illness and endured more than 20 surgeries. ‘Carol had been . battling Lupus for five years and some other related health issues when . she was diagnosed with lung cancer in September,’ said husband Lee. ‘The . memory of the last three months is not one I care to dwell on. The . thing I remember the most is her fear of never seeing her family again.' The couple have three sons and five grandchildren. 'She died in my arms at Hospice Simcoe, an amazing place here in Barrie,’ said Lee. Jason recalls that despite his mother's illnesses, she was always more concerned about other family members. Carol and Lee Ballantyne were high school sweethearts who married in 1970, she was diagnosed with lung cancer last Sept and died on Dec 30 . Jason Ballantyne, pictured left as a baby and right in more recent times, said that his mother labored most of her adult life with illness and endured more than 20 surgeries . ‘Even with all these issues she would always ask “are you doing okay?”’ he said. Jason has battled mental illness much of his life and has been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Anxiety Disorder. In . the past he has been hospitalized because of his condition, but he is . currently working his way back to full health and said he is very happy . that his mom got to see him back in a healthy place before she died. ‘Even when I was a teenager and we didn’t understand what my problem was she never gave up on me,’ he said. His father Lee, a former journalist, has said he has been impressed by how their story has captured . people's imagination and encouraged them to read Jason's blog which . not only chronicles his mother's struggle with cancer, but his own with . depression. Carol Ballantyne died in her husband's arms at Hospice Simcoe in Barrie on Dec 30 . 'Since . all this happened, he has had over 5,000 hits. People are leaving . really positive comments about his efforts to overcome depression. 'The internet is an incredible place,' he wrote for Simcoe.com. Despite . the tragic loss of his beloved wife, Lee is trying hard to retain his . zest for life. ‘There's still life in this old dog, but it will be a lot . less fun without Carol at my side,’ he said. Carol, who was 62, died over the holidays after being diagnosed with lung cancer in September. In her obit, she was remembered as a ‘loving and nurturing mother and grandmother.’ She . and her husband had been high school sweethearts, who had married in . 1970 and gone on to have three sons and five grandchildren, ‘her pride . and joy’.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . It may not be the most glamorous of archaeological finds, but the discovery of 700-year-old stinking toilets has got experts excited. Human excrement described as being in ‘excellent condition’ has been found at the 14th century site, which features a number of special purpose-built barrel latrines. Amazingly, the medieval faeces inside them still smell pungent, despite having had centuries to mellow. Whiffy: Human excrement described as being in 'excellent condition' has been found at the 14th century site, which features a number of specially-purposed barrels used as toilets . The 700-year-old barrels were used as lavatories but were previously used to transport goods and store fish. The names of their owners, before they were transformed into makeshift toilets, can also be seen on them. Three barrels were stacked on top of one another to form a well. They were tied together and lined with clay, as well as having pipes at the bottom of them. It is not yet known whether the two toilets were attached to a house or acted as a public lavatory. It is hoped that the excrement will give scientists a better idea of what people ate in Denmark at the time and it is now being analysed by experts. The waste was found on an archaeological dig at Vilhelm Werners square in Odense on the island of Funen, according to The Copenhagen Post. Markings on the wooden barrels, one of which is pictured, include the owner's details and reveal that some of them were used to transport goods, as well as store fish . Archaeologists also found three barrels (pictured) stacked on top of one another that are thought to have been used as a basic well . The find is especially useful to experts . as the barrels were used for a different purpose before they were . transformed into toilets. Markings on the wooden barrels include the owner’s details and reveal that some of them were used to transport goods, as well as to store fish. Archaeologists also found three barrels stacked on top of one another that are thought to have been used as a basic well. They were tied together and packed with clay to make them waterproof, while a system of pipes at the bottom of the structure was also discovered. Excavation of the site is continuing and it is now the largest excavation in an urban area in Danish history. Odense is the country’s third largest city. People can visit the site and have a free tour of the excavations every Tuesday and Thursday, as well as popping into the archaeologist’ workshops. While the discovery is impressive, the toilets are some way off being the oldest ever discovered. The earliest examples of toilets and sewers date to 2,800 BC when lavatories were built into the outer walls of houses in parts of India and Pakistan. Ancient people built the toilets from bricks, some of which even had wooden seats and chutes to carry waste to drains and cesspits.","Human excrement described as being in ‘excellent condition’ has been found at the 14th century site .

The firms are set to work together in a bid to make Glass, Google's wearable computer, more fashionable. The pair are set to develop a new eyewear brand for the project - but promised it would include Raybans's fashion frames and Oakley's sports glasses. Scroll down for video . RayBan's famous aviators: the firm is now working with Google to develop a version with a wearable Glass computer built in . Next generation: Google Glass has revealed the new look of its high-tech device . 'We are thrilled to announce our partnership with Google, and are proud to be once again setting the pace in the eyewear industry,' said Andrea Guerra, Chief Executive Officer of Luxottica Group. 'We live in a world where technological innovation has dramatically changed the way in which we communicate and interact in everything that we do. 'More importantly, we have come to a point where we now have both a technology push and a consumer pull for wearable technology products and applications. 'We believe that a strategic partnership with a leading player like Google is the ideal platform for developing a new way forward in our industry and answering the evolving needs of consumers on a global scale.' Google has come under fire for the unfashionable look of Glass, although has developed its own frames for the system which allow prescription lenses. 'Luxottica has built an impressive history over the last 50 years designing, manufacturing and distributing some of the most successful and well-known brands in eyewear today,' said Google Vice President and head of Google X Astro Teller. 'We are thrilled to be partnering with them as we look to push Glass and the broader industry forward into the emerging smart eyewear market.' 'The first collection generated by this partnership will combine high-end technology with avant-garde design offering the best in style, quality and performance,' the firm's say. Stylish: The frames will be available in a range of colors and will work with prescription glasses . Those who currently own the device paid $1,500 to be part of the development process, exchanging ideas on improvements to the design and function in return for the coveted device. With the release of the second-generation, those already enrolled in the Google Explorer program  will be able to 'invite' three of their friends to the scheme, according to ABC News. Reaction to the new design was mixed, with some critics saying changes to the device looked bulky. However, the updates were welcomed by those who have a first-generation device, with comments on its Google + page commenting that the changes would improve user experience. One owner, Dawn Martin, commented: 'My glass has been useless for phone calls and nav because I can't hear it well enough ... yay for updates/upgrades!' Improved: The slightly bulkier design comes with a detachable ear piece to improve commands . Upgrade: Big Bang Theory's Kunal Nayyar wearing the Google Glass at the Emmys in September. Those with the earlier design will be able to swap their old device for the new one . Another fan of the device, Jeremiah Townsend, commented: 'Can't wait ... now that we'll be able to use them with prescription glasses, they'll be glued to my face.'﻿ . Others however complained that the device was still not widely available. However, the Google Explorer program has been praised for using a clever marketing model where people buy a product at its developmental stage so they can contribute to shaping its design. 'In essence Google has crowdfunded Glass and has shown big business how crowdfunding can be done. In essence it is a giant kickstarter campaign in all but name,' according to Forbes. It estimated that Google would have earned about $50 million during the development phase as well as enhancing the desirability of the product.","Luxottica will work with Google to create glasses using the technology .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . It may not look like a typical sundial, but this cube could help you tell the time without ever having to look at a clock. Inside the cryptic cube are hundreds of metal channels cut to exactly match the angle of the sun in the sky. As the sun hits the cube, the channels project dot-matrix style numbers onto a surface to mark the hours passing. The ‘Sun Cube’ is the brainchild of Toronto-based artist Daniel Voshart who recently shared his invention on Reddit. He describes how he spent a month making the laser-cut sundial for his father's birthday last July. Mr Voshart was inspired by solargraphs which are pinhole photographs, typically capturing the passage of the sun over days or even months. But don’t get rid of your clock just yet, as even Mr Voshart claims there are some major drawbacks to the design. Inside the cryptic cube are hundreds of metal channels cut to exactly match the angle of the sun .

Inside the cryptic cube are hundreds of metal channels cut to exactly match the angle of the sun. As the sun hits the cube, the channels project dot-matrix style numbers onto a surface to mark the hours passing. By mapping the angle of the sun in the sky each day, Daniel Voshart was able to input his data into a computer programme that used Boolean logic. The computer programme was able automatically subtract one shape from another shape to come up with the perfect design. For instance, Mr Voshart said it can only be used one month in the year and will only work within 100 miles of his father’s home. As well as this, it could only be used for 40 years because of the changing tilt in Earth's axis. ‘A friend wanted to [do] a Kickstarter for this, for the GE inventor series. I wouldn't let him I was like ""no, it's not interesting"",’ Mr Voshart told Placeholder Magazine. ‘It's an obscure toy that works in one part of the world. And it's a clock. It's inventing something that is actually worse than what exists on the market. A cereal box has more functionality’. Mr Voshart, however, is considering building a large scale sculptural version for the Burning Man festival in Nevada's Black Rock Desert.

"By . Mark Prigg . Netflix boss Reed Hastings has hit out at ISPs charging the firm because of the amount of traffic it generates. In February, Netflix struck a deal to pay Comcast for faster online delivery of its movies and TV shows through a practice known as interconnection, after customers complained about slow service. Hastings called interconnection fees an 'arbitrary tax' that the company would pay in certain cases to protect its customers' experience. Netflix boss Reed Hastings called interconnection fees an 'arbitrary tax' that the company would pay in certain cases to protect its customers' experience and said ISPs must give the firm free access . 'Instead, they must provide sufficient access to their network without charge,' Hastings wrote on the Netflix blog. He said free interconnection was key to ensuring 'net neutrality,' which requires that internet providers treat data from different content companies equally. He accused firms of bullying. 'Some big ISPs are extracting a toll because they can - they effectively control access to millions of consumers and are willing to sacrifice the interests of their own customers to press Netflix and others to pay,' he wrote in the blog post. 'Though they have the scale and power to do this, they should realize it is in their long term interest to back strong net neutrality. House of Cards with Kevin Spacey as Francis Underwood and Robin Wright as Clair Underwood. A Netflix original series, it has propelled the streaming service to expanding hugely. 'While in the short term Netflix will in cases reluctantly pay large ISPs to ensure a high quality member experience, we will continue to fight for the Internet the world needs and deserves.' Comcast is seeking approval from U.S. regulators for its proposed $45.2 billion purchase of Time Warner Cable Inc. Treatment of internet traffic is one issue expected to receive scrutiny during the government's review. Hastings said Comcast 'has been an industry leader in supporting weak net neutrality, and we hope they'll support strong net neutrality as well.' Comcast, in a statement from executive vice president David Cohen, said no other company had a 'stronger commitment to openness of the Internet.' The company is the only broadband provider currently bound by the government's net neutrality, or 'Open Internet,' rules. An appeals court struck down the rules in January, but Comcast committed to following them under an agreement with the government when it purchased NBC Universal. Cohen said those rules were not meant to cover interconnection arrangements. He added that providers like Netflix had always paid for interconnection and had 'ample options' to ensure that customers enjoyed optimal performance at a fair price.","Netflix struck a deal to pay Comcast for faster online delivery in February .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Apple may have the edge over Samsung when it comes to various features, but it lags far behind in battery life. However, a recent patent could be about to change all that. Apple's latest application details a system that tracks how a person users their phone using a variety of sensors, and then makes tailored power-saving changes accordingly. Apple's latest patent, pictured, details a system that tracks how a person users their phone, and makes various power-saving changes accordingly. Built-in sensors could detect changes in light and environment, for example. The device would then automatically close apps or alter screen brightness . The YotaPhone, launched last week, is the latest Android smartphone aimed at tackling the problem of poor battery life. It has a liquid crystal display on one side, and an electronic paper display on the other. These means users can use the e-ink display for everyday tasks, because it uses less battery. They can then use the crystal display for videos and games. Its makers claim the YotaPhone has between seven and 10 times the battery life of other smartphones. The device costs £419 and is only currently available in select European countries including the UK, Spain, Germany, France and Austria. For example, the patent explained that if the system detects a 'relatively dark environment' - such as when a user plays a video game - the system may dim the backlight of the display automatically. It could also decrease the amount of power being used by the central processing unit (CPU), while increasing the amount of energy needed to power the graphical processing unit (GPU) specifically needed for the game. To do this, the phone would monitor recharge and discharge cycles. Meanwhile, various sensors inside the phone, including the gyroscope, accelerometer, GPS, and Wi-Fi units, would detect changes in environment and movement. It would also collect data about how the user interacts with the device, for example, how many times they turn the screen on, how much time they spend using certain apps, and more. Elsewhere, if a user starts watching a movie on the device, 'the system can determine whether the battery can last for the duration of the movie based on the metadata of the movie.' For example, if the system detects when a user is playing games, pictured, the system may dim the backlight of the display. It could also decrease the amount of battery being used by the central processing unit (CPU), while increasing the amount needed to power the graphical processing unit (GPU) needed for the game . The system would also collect data about how the iPhone user interacts with the device. This includes how many times they turn the screen on, how much time they spend using certain apps, and more. Image of Apple's iOS 7 is pictured . If the phone detects that the remaining power capacity won't last that long, certain power management actions may be performed. These actions may include closing or limiting power to other apps - assuming the user is unlikely to use those applications while watching the film. The phone would monitor charge cycles, while sensors inside the phone, including the gyroscope, accelerometer, and GPS, would detect other changes, patent image pictured . The system may alternatively reduce the frame rate to reduce power consumption. Apple's patent explained the system could also work the other way - by giving more power at times when the user wants the phone to be more responsive. An example given in the patent involved the use of an eWallet app, such as Passbook.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Study found all the male and female owl monkeys that cared for the young were the infants' biological parents, suggesting the species never cheated . True monogamy is rare in the animal kingdom - even in species that appear to mate for life, tests have revealed cheating is common place. However, a new study by University of Pennsylvania has found Azara's owl monkeys, buck this trend because they are ‘unusually faithful.’ The investigation of 35 offspring born to 17 owl monkey pairs turned up no evidence of cheating, and the male and female monkeys that cared for the young were the infants' true biological parents. An additional analysis of 15 pair-living mammals found a strong connection between a species' faithfulness and how much of a role the males took in caring for their young. 'Our study is the first of any primate species, and only the fourth for a pair-living mammal, to show genetic monogamy, or real faithfulness, between partners,’ said study author Eduardo Fernandez-Duque, an associate professor in Penn Arts and Sciences' Department of Anthropology. ‘Paternal care in owl monkeys now makes sense. The males are making a huge investment in their own offspring.’ As part of the Owl Monkey Project, the Penn evolutionary anthropologists have been studying a population of primates in Argentina's Chaco region for 18 years. Previous research found male and female owl monkeys form strong pair-bonds and that males contribute significantly to raising young by carrying them on their bodies, playing with them and feeding them solid foods. Although the species was known to be socially monogamous, no one had tested whether the species was genetically monogamous - in other words, whether there were any cases of females reproducing with a male other than her mate, a behaviour known as ‘extra-pair paternity’. Researchers paired behavioural field observations with genetic tests to see whether the 'social' mothers and fathers of infant monkeys were the biological parents. By examining 14 different regions of the genome, the analysis strongly suggested owl monkeys were completely faithful, stock image pictured . To test this, the researchers paired behavioural field observations with genetic tests to see whether the ‘social’ mothers and fathers of infant monkeys were the biological parents. They collected samples from 128 individual monkeys living in 29 groups or as solitary ‘floaters.’ This set included genetic samples from 35 infants born to 17 reproducing pairs. By examining 14 different regions of the genome, the analysis strongly suggested that owl monkeys were completely faithful. Researchers found no evidence of extra-pair paternity. ‘In the 18 years of the Owl Monkey . Project, we never witnessed a little sneaky copulation with a neighbour, . or that one partner dashed off for some time,’ Fernandez-Duque said. ‘So . in that sense we were not very much surprised by our results. But true . genetic monogamy is very rare. We would not have been surprised if there . had been at least one non-pair infant, but there were none.’ According to researchers, no other robust study of primates has demonstrated genetic monogamy. It has been shown in only four other mammals, including coyotes, pictured left, and the California mouse, pictured right . Researchers paired behavioural field . observations with genetic tests to see whether the ‘social’ mothers and . fathers of infant monkeys were the biological parents. They collected samples from 128 individual owl monkeys living in 29 groups, or as solitary ‘floaters.’ This set included genetic samples from 35 infants born to 17 reproducing pairs. By . examining 14 different regions of the genome, the research team's . analysis strongly suggested that owl monkeys were completely faithful. They found no evidence of extra-pair paternity. Indeed, no other robust study of primates has demonstrated genetic monogamy. It has been shown in only four other mammal species, including coyotes and the California mouse. Because the researchers were interested in how genetic monogamy has evolved and the conditions under which it occurs, they went on to perform an analysis of 15 mammal species that have been shown to live in socially monogamous pairs and for which paternity studies have been conducted. In addition to the owl monkeys, this group included birds, rodents and canines. The results of this broader investigation found that species in which males contribute significantly to infant care were more likely to be genetically monogamous. They also found an association between the strength of the bond between mates - the percentage of time the male and female spent together - and low levels of extra-pair paternity, but this connection was not as strong. Though their results underline the presence of a connection between intense male care for young and faithfulness, the researchers say they cannot, yet, tell which condition gives rise to the other. ‘Male care is surely not the only . factor explaining genetic monogamy,’ co-author Maren Huck added. ‘Some of the species . that show male care have, due for example to their foraging habits, much . more opportunities for seeking extra-pair copulations than owl . monkeys.’ The team also . noted that being a good dad can also be a mating strategy in and of . itself; females might be attracted to males that appear to be good dads. The results of a broader investigation found other species in which males contribute significantly to infant care, in addition to owl monkeys, stock image pictured, were equally likely to be genetically monogamous. Being a good dad was a mating strategy, too, and females were attracted to males with strong parenting skills . These findings in the owl monkey and other species can begin to help explain the evolution of pair-bonds in another primate species: human beings. ‘Pair bonding, love if you want, is prevalent in all human societies, whereas fathering is much more variable,’ Fernandez-Duque continued. ‘The owl monkey story is suggesting that, under very specific ecological settings, this preference for each other leads to the pair spending a lot of time in close proximity, thus facilitating paternal care and increasing paternity certainty. Genetic monogamy is the result.’ The study will be published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences.","Researchers from Pennsylvania spent 18 years studying owl monkeys .

"By . Deni Kirkova . A besotted blind couple told today how they found love and got engaged - when their guide dogs became an item. Claire Johnson, 50, first fell for Mark Gaffey, 52, when her Labrador dog Venice got friendly with fellow guide dog Rodd at Guide Dog Training classes in Shrewsbury, Shropshire. The two dogs - both aged three - became inseparable and soon their owners, who are both registered blind, soon realised they were head over heels for each other too. Scroll down for video . Claire Johnson and Mark Gaffey from Hanford, Stoke-On-Trent, only lived a mile-and-a-half away from each other but had never met . After an 11 month whirlwind romance, the couple, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs., got engaged and will tie the knot next March - with their dogs acting as ring-bearers. Mark, who was blind from birth, first met Claire when she took her dog Venice to a two week Guide Dog Training course last March. He said: 'During the training our two dogs, Rodd and Venice, seemed to know something we didn't. 'They were always playing together and nuzzling up together. 'The trainers said that they were the love and romance of the course, and they brought us together. 'We could have easily missed one another by a week because it was a residential course and we just happened to be put on the same one. The dog owners, who are both registered blind, are preparing to tie the knot after an 11-month romance . The couple's dogs will be ring-bearers at their wedding next March . 'It's ironic we met there because we discovered that we only lived a mile-and-a-half away from each other but had never met. 'We were purely in the right place at the right time. 'I have never believed in fate, but it does seem like it was meant to be. 'Each time me and Claire met for lunch the time we spent chatting got longer and the waitresses were tapping their fingers waiting for us to leave. 'There was a connection from the word go. We chatted about anything and everything. 'I trusted in the luck I didn't seem to know existed. 'Now we joke that with every guide dog you get a free fiance. I love Claire's personality and her laugh is infectious. 'We've never had an argument, we just seem to click.' The couple's love-story was featured in the ITV show 'Me and My Guide Dog' broadcast last night. Claire, who lost her sight due to diabetes when she was 24, yesterday told how she made the first move when she invited Mark for coffee at the end of the two-week residential course. She said: 'We connected straight away. I remember Mark texting me saying ""If you'd let me I could make your world a lot happier"". 'It was a lovely surprise when he proposed the first time on Valentines' Day, but I got proposed to four times that day because he kept going down on one knee. 'I suppose I can never say I will forget the day I got engaged. 'And it wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for our dogs. 'Rodd and Venice sleep in the same bed and are as much a couple as me and Mark. 'They will be walking us down the aisle and be ring bearers. This wedding is down to them.' Claire and Mark will get married at Barlaston's Upper House hotel in March next year. Now we joke that with every guide dog you get a free fiance.

From pugs to pinchers and spaniels to samoyeds, one artist has created a dog family tree (pictured) that highlights the diversity of dogs and how breeds are interconnected . The chart features 181 dog breeds from tiny ‘toy’ animals like the pug and the fluffy pomeranian to working dogs like the Alaskan malamutes and family favourites such as golden retrievers and terriers. For example, the chart shows that a chihuahua – the smallest breed of dog that heralds from Mexico – can be easily linked to rottweilers, which are popularly known to make good – and sometimes ferocious – guard dogs. According to the chart, chihuahuas are . part of the toy group and are closely related to toy pinchers, which are . in turn linked to pinchers and then common guard dogs such as the rotweiller. In the similar way, the giant saint bernard is related to the little pug via the working dogs group, then common guard dogs group, followed by the pincher and toy pincer groups, which then link to the 'toy' dogs of which the pug is a member. From terriers to toys - such as pugs, pomeranians and shih tzus (pictured in this portion of the chart) - and mountain dogs to sight hounds, the dog family tree delineates almost every standard pure-breed dog so you can see how one dog is connected to another . It might seem incredible that dogs with . such different visible characteristics – from their size to their type . of hair – can be so different, but it is because all dogs are members of . the same species – Canis lupus familiaris. Their genetic code is relatively simple compared to other species and is therefore easily adaptable as drastic changes - such as the type of hair or ears – is controlled by a single genetic variation. The family tree makes it easy to see which dogs belong to the same ‘family’ groups. For instance, groups of dogs such as setters, pointers, spaniels and retrievers belong to the ‘sporting dogs’ group, as well as individual breeds including the vizsla and wirehaired pointing griffon.

Dalmatians are relatively closely related to a number of unlikely breeds. According to the chart, the spotty dogs are closely linked to the diminutive French bulldog and candy-floss like bichon frise. The ‘diagram of dogs’ is for sale as a limited edition print and Pop Chart Lab, the company selling it, said: ‘Dog lovers of every preference are sure to spot their favourite canine compadre in this pedigreed presentation of man's best friends - a taxonomical treat that's best in show.’ According to a study published earlier this year, dogs and wolves evolved from a common ancestor between 11,000 and 34,000 years ago. It might seem incredible that dogs with such different visible characteristics - from their size to their type of hair - can be so different, but it is because all dogs are members of the same species - Canis lupus familiaris. Some of the largest types of dogs fall in the 'working dogs' category, which is shown in this part of the dog family tree . U.S. scientists said that part of the genetic overlap observed between some modern dogs and wolves is the result of interbreeding after dog domestication and not a direct line of descent from one group of wolves. They believe their research reflects a more complicated history than the popular story that early farmers adopted a few docile, friendly wolves that later became our modern canine companions. Instead, the earliest dogs may have first lived among hunter-gatherer societies and adapted to agricultural life later, according to the study. Researchers from the University of Chicago said that dogs are more closely related to each other than to wolves, regardless of geographic origin as they do not descend from a single line of wolves. Some of the most popular dog breeds, including labradors and golden retrievers but it are shown in this portion of the chart, but it is easy to see how they are closely related to more 'exotic' breeds such as the vizsla . Dalmatians (pictured) are relatively closely related to a number of unlikely breeds, according to the chart. They are closely linked to the diminutive french bulldog and candy-floss like bichon frise . Every breed of dog is a member of exactly the same species - Canis lupus familiaris, regardless of its coat, shape or size. While some variation between breeds has occurred naturally, most of the very obvious differences are the direct result of human breeding. Many dogs nowadays are bred for their aesthetic qualities but in the past there were more practical motivations behind human intervention in the gene pool. Lots of dogs were raised to be the best possible hunters, such as the dachshund, which was bred to get in to badgers' setts with their low, narrow entrances - hence its name, which means 'badger dog' in German. One possible reason dogs are so easily adaptable is because changing their genetic code is relatively simple compared to many other species. In human genes, for example, nearly every characteristic is governed by a complex network of genes, which work in combination to display certain outcomes. But with dogs, many quite drastic changes, such as fur type and ear shape, are controlled by a single genetic variation. In fact, a huge research project called CanMap determined that every single biological difference affecting dogs' appearance is controlled by one of around 50 gene variations. This simplicity is partly a result of the human activity which has tinkered with canine biology for thousands of years, and has therefore picked out the characteristics most easily changed by simple genes.","Family tree highlights the diversity of dogs and how the pure breeds are interconnected .

"By . Sara Malm . Lipstick ban: Flight attendants on Turkish Airlines have been ordered not to wear red lipstick or nail polish in a move attacked as 'too religious' Female flight attendants at Turkey’s national airline have been banned from wearing red lipstick and nail polish, prompting renewed fears from secular Turks the country is becoming more Islamic. Turkish Airlines, Europe's fourth-biggest carrier, said the ban was aimed at keeping crews 'artless and well-groomed with makeup in pastel tones' because a natural look improved communication with passengers. But critics say it reflects the creeping influence of the government's Islamic values. The new rule will be imposed just one . year after the airline lifted its ban on headscarves among its staff. ‘This new guideline is totally down . to Turkish Airlines management's desire to shape the company to fit its . own political and ideological stance,’ Atilay Aycin, the president of Turkish Airlines' worker's union, said. ‘No one can deny that Turkey has become a more conservative, religious country.’ Turkey is 99 per cent Muslim, but the NATO state and European Union candidate has a secular constitution. There have been concerns in recent years that an increasingly wealthy but pious middle-class is emerging in Turkey that wants to practise its religion more freely. Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's ruling AK Party, which traces its roots to a banned Islamic party, has also come under strong pressure from grassroots supporters  to relax the state's control over the expression of religion. Such restrictions were aimed at reining in Islamism and improving women's rights, but effectively prevented many devout women from studying at university or taking government jobs. Mr Erdogan, whose wife Emine wears a headscarf, has previously said he is committed to secularism, but does not believe it should be at the expense of those who want to express their religious beliefs. Turkish Airlines cabin crew in 1974: The company saidn the ban on red lipstick and nail polish was brought in simply because staff no longer wear red uniforms and not for any religious reason . Conservative control: Turkish Airlines have been accused of imposing conservative Islamist views on their staff by preventing them from wearing the makeup of their choice . Turkish Airlines defended its new rule, . saying: 'As a consequence of our current cabin uniforms not including . red, dark pink, etc., the use of lipstick and nail polish in these . colours by our cabin crew impairs visual integrity,' It sent social networks into a frenzy, with many women posting pictures of . themselves with red lips in protest. One wrote: ‘Why not just ban stewardesses altogether so we can all breathe a sigh of relief?’ Some male Twitter users were indignant over the insinuation that red lipstick would induce a sexual frenzy. 'They are objecting to the lipstick and . nail polish that we have been using for years,' said Asli Gokmen, 30, a former Turkish Airlines' flight attendant who lost her job with more than 300 others last year . during a union protest. No current employees were available for comment. Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, whose wife Emine (pictured) wears a headscarf, said he is committed to secularism, but not at the expense of those who want to express their religious beliefs . Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said he is committed to secularism . Turkey has remained a secular consitution since the modernising reforms of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who threw religion out of public life in the 1920s and 1930s as he rebuilt Turkey from the ruins of the Ottoman Empire. The powerful military views itself as the ultimate guarantor of Turkey's secular order and has ousted four democratically elected governments in the past 50 years, most recently in 1997 when with public support it drove out a cabinet it viewed as too Islamist. The current government, led by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, is run by the Muslim AK party which has its roots in a banned Islamic movement. He is currently serving his third term as Prime Minister heading the conservative faith based Justice and Development Party, also known as the AK Party. He founded the AK Party in 2001 upon his release from prison where the former mayor of Istanbul, served ten months for reciting an illegal Islamist poem during a public address in the province of Siirt. As he was banned from public office following the speech including the poem, he could not become Prime Minister when the party won the general election in 2002, a ban which was lifted in 2003. However, under Erdogan’s leadership the country has relaxed restrictions on religious expression, including lifting the ban on head scarves in courts and schools. Turkish . Airlines passenger Ahmet Yerli, 33, said he did not think the new . guideline was a sign of creeping Islamisation but that the ban was still . ‘absurd.’ ‘I've never heard of a plane crashing because of a women's lipstick,’ he said before his flight. The company caused a stir earlier this year after mockups of a new Ottoman-style uniform were leaked online. The uniform for stewardesses, which . featured loose-fitting ankle-length dresses and fez-style hats, were . criticised for being too conservative and were branded 'a joke' by . Turkish designers, saying they misrepresented the country. 'The . clothes look like they belong to Kuwait or Saudi Arabian Airlines. However, they should reflect Turkey and Turkey is not this,' designer . Vural Gökçaylı told Hurriyet Daily News. In response to the critique, Turkish Airlines said the design was not the final product and the conservative uniform never materialised. Islam is the main religion in Turkey . with 99 per cent of the population identifying themselves as Muslim, . including those who define themselves as secular with a Muslim . background. Despite . this, the tradition of wearing a headscarf, a practice associated with . Islam which is followed by many Muslim women, is banned in a majority of . jobs in Turkey. Turkey's . constitution prohibits women working in the public sector, such as . lawyers, teachers, or anyone working on state premises, from covering . their head - a ban which and until 2008 also applied to university . students. In 2007 . Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, head of the moderately Islamic AK Party, . tried to lift the ban, but was stopped by Turkey's Constitutional Court . which ruled that removing the ban was against the founding principles of . the constitution. However, Prime Minister Erdogan, who won . the 2007 promising to scrap the ban, said last month he did not believe . constitutional change was needed to abolish the ban on headscarves in . the public sector.","Air hostesses on Turkish Airlines banned from wearing red lipstick .

'It was chucking it down with rain and Fergie pulled me aside and said “do me a favour, call the game off’,"" Gallagher told Sportlobster TV. 'I asked why and he said “there’s nowhere else to fit this game in and the Premier League will have to extend the season. We’ll have a better chance of winning the match and we’ll win the league at Old Trafford”. 'At half time United were losing 3-1 and the pitch was like a swimming pool. As we came off he said “I know we’re 3-1 down but please call it off, we could do with a hand here”. 'They managed to pull it back to 3-3 and in the last minute Dennis Irwin ran into the box and went down in front of the Stretford End and I only gave a goal kick. 'At full-time Fergie sprinted across the pitch and shouted at me furiously. My wife said, “Fergie had a right go at you about that penalty didn’t he”. Call it off? Ferguson wanted the game to be postponed while United were 3-1 down against Boro in 1997 . One up: Juninho (left) puts Middlesbrough in the lead but the North East side were unable to win . 'I told her he hadn’t mentioned the penalty. She asked why he came tearing across the pitch at me then. The truth is he ran over and asked me if I was going out to dinner that night. I said “no” and he asked “why are we leaving so early then?”.' Indeed, Ferguson's ability to squeeze every last second out of officials when his side were losing has since been highlighted. With United trailing at Old Trafford under their former boss, an average of 79 seconds extra was played in added time. Retired: But Gallagher has lifted the lid on Ferguson's hairdryer . Fury: Ferguson blasts Mike Dean during a clash with Newcastle on Boxing Day last season . However, this compares to just 40 seconds extra under his successor David Moyes. Gallagher went on to reveal the anxiety caused by not awarding key decisions to United. 'Years and years ago one of the referees had a heart monitor on during a match at Old Trafford,' he explained. 'They were assessing it and suddenly it jumped and went through the roof. They looked at the DVD and he’d just turned down a penalty in front of the Stretford End. The pressure is immense.'","Dermot Gallagher claims Sir Alex Ferguson asked him to call game off against Middlesbrough in 1997 .

"By . Matt Blake . A Chinese fish market was thrown into turmoil yesterday after a monger found a live and unexploded bomb inside the belly of a squid. The drama unfolded in a seafood bazaar in Guangdong province to the south of China as the unsuspecting fishmonger gutted the three-foot cephalopod for a customer. When he sank his knife into the tentacled sea-creature's soft flesh its blade struck something hard and metallic. Squidiotic thing to eat: The drama unfolded in a Chinese seafood bazaar like this one as the unsuspecting fishmonger gutted the three-foot cephalopod for a customer . He opened it up to find the eight-inch explosive that experts later revealed could have gone off at any moment. He called police instantly who arrived at the scene and took the ordinance away to perform a controlled explosion. It is yet unclear how the bomb found its . way inside the squid, although police said it may have been dropped by a . fighter plane and washed into the squid's feeding ground. They would . not reveal how old it was or whether it was of Chinese origin. 'This sort of squid lives close to the shore and normally makes a meal of small fish and prawns,' said the fishmonger, who gave his name only as Mr Huang to the local Guangzhou Daily newspaper. Squidden inside: The squid was caught in shallows off the coast of Jiaoling county in Guangdong province where squid like to hunt, mine-sweeping the sandy bed for bite-size sealife . 'Perhaps he thought the bomb was his . favourite food and gulped it down. He certainly had a big belly when he . was caught,' he added.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . The Winter Olympics is a chance for skiers and skaters to shine but scientists warn the event could be under threat from climate change. Just six of the previous Winter Olympics host cities will be cold enough to reliably host the games by the end of this century if global warming projections prove accurate, a team of international researchers have claimed. And this year’s host city, Sochi in Russia, is not among them. The competition could be heating up: With conservative climate projections, only 11 of the previous 19 sites could host the Games in the coming decades, according to a new study . Albertville, France - host of the 1992 games . Calgary, Canada - host of the 1988 games . Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy - 1956 . St.Mortiz, France -  1948 . Salt Lake City - U.S. - 2002 . Sapporo - Japan - 1972 . A new study from the University of Waterloo, Canada and the Management Centre Innsbruck, Austria, found that even with conservative climate projections, only 11 of the previous 19 sites could host the Games in the coming decades. ‘The cultural legacy of the world's celebration of winter sport is increasingly at risk,’ said Professor Daniel Scott, a Canada Research Chair in global tourism and lead author of the study. ‘Fewer and fewer traditional winter sports regions will be able to host a Olympic Winter Games in a warmer world.’ Just six of the previous Winter Olympics host cities will be cold enough to reliably host the games by the end of this century if global warming projections prove accurate and this year's host city, Sochi in Russia (pictured) is not among them . The researchers found that renowned sites, including Squaw Valley in the U.S. Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Germany, Vancouver in Canada and Sochi in Russia would no longer have climates suitable to reliably host the games by the middle of the 21st century. With additional warming projected for later decades of this century, as few as six former host locations would remain climatically suitable, they said. ‘This report clearly points out the challenges that lie ahead for the Olympics because of climate change,’ said Chris Steinkamp, executive director of Protect Our Winters, who was not involved with the study. With additional warming projected for later decades of this century, as few as six former host locations would remain climatically suitable. The bobsleigh run in La Plagne, Sacoie, France that was used for the Winter Olympics 1992 is pictured . Average February daytime temperature of Winter Games locations have risen . ‘It's particularly powerful to see how . past Olympic host cities could be impacted under a higher emission . scenario, so hopefully this will serve as a wake-up call to the IOC and . world leaders that major commitments to carbon reductions need to be . made.’ The need for weather risk management strategies by Olympic organisers has intensified as the average February daytime temperature of Winter Games locations has steadily increased – from 0.4°C at events held between 1920 and 1959, to 3.1°C for the Winter Olympics during the 1960s to 1990s. The average daytime temperature in February is predicted to rise to 7.8°C in the 21st century, ruining the prospect of snow in many cities. Dr Robert Steiger of the Management Centre Innsbruck, said: ‘Today it would be difficult to imagine successfully delivering the diverse games programme exclusively on natural ice and snow, as it was in the early decades of the Olympic Winter Games. Weather risk management will become even more important in the coming decades with average February temperatures in past Winter Olympic host locations expected to warm an additional 1.9 to 2.1°C by mid-century and 2.7 to 4.4°C in late century. The researchers found that renowned sites, including Squaw Valley in the U.S, Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Germany, Vancouver in Canada (pictured) and Sochi in Russia would no longer have climates suitable to reliably host the Games by the middle of the 21st century . The study found that poor weather is highlighted as one of the greatest challenges faced by Olympic organising committees. Weather affects the ability to prepare for the games and can directly impact outdoor opening and closing ceremonies, fairness of outdoor competitions, spectator comfort, transportation and visibility and timing of television broadcasts. The study also examined how technological advancements and strategies developed over several decades have been used to manage weather risk at the Winter Olympics. Technology like track and jump refrigeration, snowmaking and high-resolution weather forecasting are now critical components of staging a successful Winter Games. Average February daytime temperature of Winter Games locations has steadily increased from 0.4°C at events held between 1920 and 1959, to 3.1°C for the Winter Olympics during the 1960s to 1990. Eddie 'the eagle' Edwards is pictured at the 188 games in Calgary . ‘Despite technological advances, there are limits to what current weather risk management strategies can cope with,’ said Professor Scott. ‘By the middle of this century, these limits will be surpassed in some former Winter Olympic host regions.’ The study reveals that for some cities and regions interested in hosting a future Winter Olympics, the time to bid for the games might be sooner than later. The average daytime temperature in February is predicted to rise to 7.8°C in the 21st century, ruining the prospect of snow in many cities. Squaw Valley, California is one of the former Winter Olympics sites that might be too warm to play host to the games in the future .","Even with conservative climate projections, only 11 of the previous 19 sites could host the Games in the coming decades .

"By . Helen Pow . Marilyn Monroe called Jackie Kennedy at the White House and confessed she was having an affair with her husband, to which the First Lady responded 'that's great... I'll move out and you'll have all the problems,' according to an explosive new book. In 'These Few Precious Days: The Final Year of Jack with Jackie,' author Christopher Andersen claims Jackie 'knew everything' about Jack's cheating and turned a blind eye, but his relationship with Marilyn 'seemed to bother her the most.' And she was right to fear the bombshell actress, because Marilyn's sights were firmly set on becoming the President's second wife. Affair: A new book claims Marilyn Monroe, pictured with JFK, called Jackie Kennedy and confessed she was sleeping with the President . Marilyn, who long grappled with psychiatric and emotional problems as well as drugs and alcohol, was convinced JFK was about to leave Jackie for her, her friend Jeanne Carmen reportedly revealed. 'Can't you just see me,' she asked Carmen, 'as first lady?' According to excerpts of the book, published by The New York Post today, Peter Lawford claimed Marilyn called Jackie and told her she was sleeping with Jack, and that he'd allegedly promised to leave his family for her. 'Marilyn, you'll marry Jack, that's great,' Jackie responded, according to the account. 'And you'll move into the White House and you'll assume the responsibilities of first lady, and I'll move out and you'll have all the problems.' Revelations: The revelations are contained in the explosive book 'These Few Precious Days,' pictured . Andersen writes JFK's Air Force aide, General Godfrey McHugh, revealed early on that 'Jackie knew about his women' and her friend Ralph Martin agreed. 'You know, in the end Jackie knew everything. Every girl. She knew her rating, her accomplishments . . .' However, she didn't take his cheating lightly. Jack's close friend, George Smathers, said Jackie was 'damn mad' about his fooling around, but she was willing to look the other way as long as he was careful and didn't humiliate her. Jackie reportedly feared her own sexual inadequacies were pushing Jack into the arms of other women. Jackie knew: The book claims that Jackie, pictured left with JFK and daughter Caroline in 1960, knew about his affairs, but his relationship with Marilyn Monroe, right, concerned her most . But she complained of the President's love-making to her long-time confidant Dr. Frank Finnerty, claiming 'he just goes too fast and falls asleep.' Aside from the ladies, Andersen offers a fascinating insight into JFK's dependence on drugs. His physician Max Jacobson, known as Dr Feelgood, administered high-dosage amphetamine shots laced with steroids to the president on a regular basis, the book claims, and even the first lady. Dr. Max's four-times-weekly injections worried other physicians who believed they might react with the dozen or so other drugs Jack was taking for his other health woes. Gore Vidal reportedly said he was 'horrified' to learn Dr Feelgood was treating the President and, according to the book, told Jackie to 'Watch out' because 'Max drove several people mad.'","'These Few Precious Days: The Final Year of Jack with Jackie' claims the First Lady 'knew everything' about JFK's cheating .

"By . Taylor Auerbach . Two glamorous Australian socialites who escaped conviction for a 'cat fight' alleged to have taken place over stolen fashion accessories have taken to social media to voice - and sing - their relief. Gabriela Cevallos, a 30-year-old bikini model whose Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts are full of images of her clad in racy lingerie and straddling office chairs was found not guilty of assault. Her friend Bethany Heagney, 28, who describes herself as a Mormon, was also cleared when they appeared at Sydney's Downing Centre local court on Monday. Scroll down for video . Cringeworthy: The two best friends published a mocking rap video hours after their not guilty verdict . Their lengthy legal battle ended when magistrate Michael Barko found they acted in self-defence against former friend Jasmin Keomanivong outside a waterfront Sydney restaurant on May 5, 2012. Ms Keomanivong told police she was punched, kicked and had her hair pulled by the two dazzling best friends at the end of a fashion parade. But Sydney's Daily Telegraph reported magistrate Barko found the defendants to be 'more reliable and credible witnesses' and found the pair not guilty of three charges each. Within hours Ms Cevallos was on Instagram posting messages of joy and even taking digs at her would-be victim. 'THANK YOU! So happy with today's outcome. Also grateful to all my friends & family who have been there to support me @bethany_instagram #rideordie ...and all I have to say to Jasmine is #BYEFELICIA' she wrote alongside a picture of the quote 'Today I am thankful'. Friend and co-accused Bethany wrote 'Yes!!!' under the image before posting an video of the two driving around the streets of Sydney while rapping, making 'V' for victory signs with their fingers and cheering 'we made it baby'. Bikini babe: Gabriela Cevallos' social media accounts are full of saucy images . Colourful past: Bethany Heagney, who describes herself as a Mormon, once dated a convicted killer . The film clip - which shows Ms Cevallos sitting behind the wheel - was posted late on Monday night alongside the hashtags '#WeWon!' and '#YeahWeDid'. The brunette is a former girlfriend of South Sydney Rabbitohs rugby league star Sam Burgess. Bethany Heagney used to date twice-convicted killer Mustapha Dib. She told the court earlier: 'I was punched to the face ... I punched (Jasmin) back, I thought she was going to keep hitting me.' She also said Ms Keomanivong was being intimidating towards her best friend. 'I'm really relieved, the truth's come out, our name's been cleared, it's good,' she told Channel 7 after Monday's not guilty verdict. The trial has been the talk of the Sydney media and a source of gossip for the city's social circles for two years with the girls making headlines repeatedly for turning up to court in designer clothes and clutching Chanel handbags. New South Wales police didn't lay charges until three months after the bizarre fashion parade bust-up took place. Welcome relief: The glamorous best friends told reporters they were happy their names had been cleared . Not guilty: Magistrate Michael Barko was convinced the girls acted in self defence . During the trial it was found that the alleged victim's statements to investigators were riddled with errors. Summing up the real life courtroom drama, Ms Cevallos told her more than 40,000 Instagram followers: 'After 2 years of being accused of some serious allegations our names have finally been cleared.' Ms Cevallos, of Waterloo in Sydney's inner south, is listed as the owner of Mero Mero, a health food shop described online as 'a rapidly growing healthy fast food franchise business based in Australia, conceptualised to combat Australiaâ€™s growing obesity problem.' She formerly hosted shows on Australian pay TV network Fuel. Ms Heagney, a resident of the Sutherland Shire, is a mother-of-two and former marketing manager. When her then partner Mustapha Dib was jailed in 2012 for the  murder of pregnant woman Anita Vrzina she wrote on Facebook: 'I love you, I miss you so much baby.'

"By . Duncan Farmer . As Charles Dickens sat eating his picnic lunch among the gravestones of St James churchyard in the Kent village of Cooling, inspiration came to him for the opening scenes  of Great Expectations, in which the convict Magwitch meets orphan Pip. Many of the graves in the churchyard – six miles from Dickens’s former home in Rochester – mark the resting places of members of the family of Eliza Clay, a landowner’s widow who built nearby Cooling Court in 1700 and whose family owned it until 1930. Today, the beautiful three-storey, four-bedroom farmhouse sitting in grounds of one-and-a-half acres is owned by Stuart and Stephanie Hatton, who fell in love with it the moment they saw it. Dickensian manor:  In the three years since Stuart and Stephanie Hatton bought Cooling Court in Cooling, Kent, its value has jumped by more than a third, to £825,000 . ‘It was the only house we looked at when we decided to move from Buckinghamshire to Kent,’ says Stephanie, 31. ‘We were driving away from the viewing and I told Stuart to turn the car round, go back and tell the owner to sell it to no one else.’ They agreed to pay the £600,000 asking price and moved in within weeks. It proved a shrewd buy, and in the three years since they bought it, its value has jumped by more than a third, to £825,000, even though they have spent just £50,000 repointing the brickwork and improving the turning circle. They could have added more value  by turning the former servants’ quarters on the top floor into more bedrooms. The reason for the increase in value is the growing popularity of this corner of North Kent and the improvement in road and rail links to London and Paris, which is just two hours away. Trains from Ebbsfleet station take just 19 minutes to travel to St Pancras; the Bluewater shopping centre is 20 minutes away and trains from Rochester or Strood take less than an hour to reach London. ‘We can be at our office in East London in  45 minutes,’ says Stephanie, who, with Stuart, runs an agency providing off-screen ‘talent’, such as camera crews, directors and runners, to the film and television industry. Indoor space: The three-floor home has four bedrooms, but the old servants quarter could be refurbished into four more . She adds: ‘We’re only moving because we need to be nearer to my mother in Cambridgeshire, but a house like this there would cost well over £1 million.’ The house is quintessentially English. Its reflection is clear in the pond in the garden. The rooms are generously proportioned and plentiful, and the decor is tasteful. One of Cooling Court’s other attractions for the Hattons and their sons, Max, five, and three-year-old Zach, was its top floor – 1,400 square feet of space that used to contain servants’ bedrooms. ‘It hasn’t been lived  in for 100 years,’ says Stuart. ‘At the moment it’s stripped back to the plaster and has original oak floorboards and timbers. There’s room for four large bedrooms because it has the same footprint as the floor below.’ The next owners of the property might not need four new bedrooms as the existing accommodation offers plenty of space. The four first-floor bedrooms are all doubles, and on the ground floor is a large reception hall, two sitting rooms and a wide staircase. There is also a breakfast/dining room with an Aga – this room could be turned into a large kitchen to replace the smaller existing one. Inspiration: The village of Cooling inspired Charles Dickens for the opening scenes of Great Expectations. There is also an attached workshop, utility room and study. And it is no surprise to discover that the property has featured  on the TV househunting show Escape To  The Country. Outside, the gardens include  an orchard and enjoy views across the  Kent countryside. A marble plaque on an exterior wall of Cooling Court records Eliza Clay as its builder, and the village of Cooling itself is steeped in history. Its castle was built in the 14th Century and, although most of it is now in ruins, a house within is owned by Jools Holland, the television presenter and musician. In the opening chapter of Great Expectations, Dickens describes the churchyard where Pip’s parents are buried as a ‘bleak place, overgrown with nettles’. St James churchyard, however, epitomises the charm and tranquillity of the English countryside. ‘This part of Kent is becoming more and more desirable because you get a lot for your money,’ says Stuart, 34. ‘It’s a beautiful little village with a great traditional pub. We won’t get anything like this where we’re looking.’ Ironically, for some buyers, Cooling Court’s rural location may be a deterrent. ‘It is in a very quiet spot,’ says Martin Lawson, of the estate agency Fine and Country in West Malling, which is selling the house. ‘A lot of people either want to live in town or just outside. Cooling Court is a lot more remote.’ However, he adds: ‘We’ve had a lot of interest, even though it’s only just come on  the market.’ Fine & Country, 01732 222272 .","Three-storey farmhouse Cooling Court in Cooling, Kent, is on sale .

"By . Meghan Keneally . The U.S. military has spent $34million building a state-of-the-art building on a base in southern Afghanistan that no American soldiers will ever use. Military officials warned that the proposed building was an example of wasteful spending three years ago when the construction began but their warnings went unheeded and the contractors built the expansive two-story facility anyway. Now a special inspector general who is reviewing spending in Afghanistan has written a scathing letter to the Secretary of Defense saying that the building, which is in the compound of Camp Leatherneck, is symbolic of the overwhelming bureaucracy in the region. Seats to fill: The command and control facility at Camp Leatherneck in southern Afghanistan cost $34million . Ghost town: The two-story facility will now likely be demolished because American troops are being pulled out of the region, and it will be too expensive for the fledgling Afghan army to maintain . 'Unfortunately, it is unused, unoccupied, and presumably will never be used for its intended purpose,' John F. Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, wrote in a letter to Secretary Hagel. 'This is an example of what is wrong with military construction in general â€” once a project is started, it is very difficult to stop. 'One senior U.S. military official told me that this facility was designed for a military division that was never deployed and, subsequently, a decision was made not to construct the facility, but inexplicably the building construction started and is now complete.' In order to make it useable by anyone, communications equipment must still be bought and installed, which Mr Sopko estimates will cost $3million more. No plans to share: The facility, the briefing room of which is shown above, was deemed unnecessary by insiders three years ago when construction began three years ago but they went ahead anyway . Under investigation: A special inspector general is now looking into why construction on the building went ahead in spite of calls by military officers to save the money . 'I am deeply concerned that (U.S. Forces-Afghanistan) may be spending additional taxpayer dollars on a facility no one will ever use,' he wrote. The Washington Post reports that the 64,000-foot facility features spacious offices with unused furniture, powerful air conditioners and security systems up to the military's high standards. The problem, however, is that President Obama already announced the scheduled withdrawal of American troops from the war-ravaged country. As a result, experts and military leaders in the country view the building on Camp Leatherneck as a waste. 'What the hell were they thinking? There was never any justification to build something this fancy,' an unidentified two-star Army General told The Washington Post. Up in smoke: The facility on Camp Leatherneck is just one of a handful of multimillion dollar projects that are now left to rot in Afghanistan as American troops prepare to leave the region . The inspector general said that there are really just two possible prospects for the facility: it will be handed over to the Afghan army or demolished entirely. Obviously it would be better for the nascent national army to take advantage of the facility, but more problems lie there simply because it was built to high American standards with strong air conditioning units that require significant- and expensive- electricity, meaning the upkeep would be costly for the Afghans. On top of that, all of the electrical plugs were made for 110-volt machines that Americans use, as opposed to the 220-volt products used by locals, making it even likely that it will be demolished. The completion of the building just adds to the growing outrage over other multimillion dollar projects that have been commissioned throughout the region. Passing the torch: The Afghan army will take over some of the American bases when the U.S. troops leave but not all of them (Prime Minister David Cameron toured Camp Leatherneck in 2011) The Washington Post also cites two other controversial spending projects that have been tossed aside. The military spent $45million on a repair facility that was intended to fix armored vehicles, but now it is being used as a staging area to sort through military equipment due to be shipped out of the country. An even more glaring example of wasteful spending is the building the military poured more than $80million into in northern Afghanistan that they planned to use as an American consulate. After paying for the refurbishment and the 10-year lease, the facility was deemed too unsafe and a clear target for terrorist attacks, so it remains unused.","A two-story facility was built on Camp Leatherneck in southern Afghanistan in spite of official warnings that it was unnecessary .

"By . Bianca London . The children have opened their presents, the turkey is in the oven and the chatty relatives are gathered in the lounge but as the clock strikes 12.56pm on Christmas Day, our stress levels peak. The most stressful time on Christmas Day has been revealed as 12.56pm - just before lunch is served. Almost half of Brits (47 per cent) say preparing the turkey, vegetables, and all the trimmings is the most demanding task they face on December 25. Stress o'clock: A new study has revealed that 12.56pm is the most stressful time on Christmas Day - just before dinner is served . This is because of the difficulty of timing everything right (33 per cent), and coping with interfering relatives (16 per cent). Others are stressed by the effort required to chop, peel, baste, and mix (15 per cent), and struggling to squeeze everything in the oven (32 per cent). The pressure is heaped on by the amount of time put into making sure everything is perfect, found the new study. The average adult spends four hours 30 minutes preparing and cooking Christmas dinner. This is only slightly less than the four hours 36 minutes spent chatting, playing games, and watching television with family. Multitasking: Almost half of Brits say preparing the turkey, vegetables, and all the trimmings is the most demanding task they face on December 25 . And it is significantly more than the 38 minutes dedicated to unwrapping presents, and one hour 39 minutes sat at the dinner table. An eager one in ten amateur cooks spend six hours or more slaving over the stove, the poll of 2,000 people revealed. Furthermore, we first think about the meal on December 14 and then spend 14 hours worrying about it before preparations even start. The biggest annoyance with poorly made mains is cold food (27 per cent), watery gravy (26 per cent), and raw turkey (20 per cent). Tough meat also fails to impress. Men typically cook their first Christmas dinner at a later age than women, starting at 27 rather than 25. Was it worth it? An eager one in ten amateur cooks spend six hours or more slaving over the stove, the poll of 2,000 people revealed . They also admit they struggle to multitask, with 28 per cent saying it is what makes cooking stressful. One in seven people aged 55 and over, and 38 per cent of all men have never cooked a Christmas dinner - and only 35 per cent of men have made a Christmas cake. A spokesman from Magimix, who commissioned the survey, said: 'Christmas cooking is becoming a real source of stress for the nation, with 12.56pm the time we're tipping over the edge. 'It's understandable that people want the most important meal of the year to be perfect but many of us are putting unnecessary pressure on ourselves to impress family and friends.'","Half of Brits say preparing turkey and trimmings is most demanding task .

Many of his subjects were showbusiness friends who visited his luxurious beach house or his New York studio known as The Factory. Now the exhibit I'll Be Your Mirror will show superstars like John Lennon, Mick Jagger, Elizabeth Taylor, Madonna, Sting, Bruce Springsteen, Liza Minnelli, Diana Ross and Debbie Harry. These never-before-seen photographs of celebrities captured by Andy Warhol are about to become and exhibition. This 1979 picture shows John Lennon and the boyfriend of fashion designer Roy Halston Frowick, known as Halston . Icons: Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones and author William Burroughs, who wrote Naked Lunch and other seminal postmodern works . Warhol's shot of Lennon was taken in New York in 1979, a year before he was murdered, and shows the boyfriend of fashion designer Roy Halston Frowick, known as Halston, poking his tongue out behind the Beatle. Warhol also turned his artistic eye to capturing domestic items and hum-drum objects like a room service tray and, bizarrely, a row of toilet urinals. The body of work also includes a number of self-portraits, including one of him wearing a green jumper and eating a bowl of cornflakes. Warhol, who died in 1987, only ever made one print of each of his photos, so they are unique works of art. Broken heroes: New Jersey rock musician Bruce Springsteen caught in a candid moment. Right, Musician John 'Jellybean' Benitez and Madonna . Sting, formerly of The Police. Warhol, who died in 1987, only ever made one print of each of his photos, so they are unique works of art. He gave many of them to his long-time diarist, Pat Hackett, and they will now be exhibited and sold. They will go on general sale at the online art and antiqe dealers 1stdibs.com and will cost up to Â£5,000 pounds for a print. Miss Hackett said: 'Andy had an artist's eye and everything that he did he applied it to. 'He would see odd things that he would photograph, his skill was deciding what you want to photograph. Photography was something the next phase of his art career and was something that Andy was progressing with much more. 'I am selling these photos now because Andy died before he was able to present them to a wider public. They haven't been given the attention that Andy would have expected. Debbie Harry of Blondie.

Some of the prints being sold are owned by Warhol collector Jim Hedges, 45. Mr Hodges said: 'Warhol obsessively photographed different subjects. That was part of the genius of Andy Warhol. 'He conveyed in his art the highest of the highs, like show business people, and the lowest of the lows, like a urinal. This is fresh material and gives a new light on Andy Warhol's work.' The exhibition will open at the New York Design Center from September 3. Andy Warhol eating a giant bowl of Corn Flakes at The Factory (left).

"By . Lucy Crossley . Demand for homes is outstripping supply across the country as new figures show properties are only on the market for a matter of weeks, increasing fears of a housing price bubble. House sellers are achieving 96.2 per cent of their asking price typically, marking the highest proportion seen in a decade as buyers chase a scarce supply of homes. In London, sellers are getting around 99.3 per cent of their asking price and across every region the figure is above 93 per cent, pointing to further price rises, according to the report by property analyst Hometrack. House hunt: Demand for homes is outstripping supply across the country as new figures show properties are only on the market for a matter of weeks, increasing fears of a housing price bubble . The report for the month of March also revealed that across England and Wales, the length of time properties are typically spending on the market before being snapped up has dropped to just under eight weeks for the first time since 2007, while homes in London are taking just over two and a half weeks on average to sell. House prices increased by 0.6 per cent month-on-month in March, which is slightly down on a 0.7 per cent rise in February, although for the second month in a row half of postcodes across the country reported rising property values. Prices rose by 0.2 per cent in Yorkshire and Humberside and the North West, by 0.3 per cent in the West Midlands and the North East, by 0.4 per cent in the East Midlands, by 0.6 per cent in Wales, by 0.7 per cent in the South East and London and by 0.8 per cent in the South West and East Anglia. Richard Donnell, director of research at Hometrack, said that while there has been much talk of the impact on the housing market of the Government's Help to Buy scheme to help people with low mortgage deposits, overall sales supported by Help to Buy are 'relatively small'. Impact: Researchers say that while there has been much talk of the impact on the housing market of the Government's Help to Buy scheme, overall sales supported by Help to Buy are 'relatively small' 'The real driver of higher house prices is record low mortgage rates and strong demand from first-time buyers and investors who have no property to sell, which is compounding scarcity,' he said. 'With average mortgage rates currently at 3 per cent or lower, compared to over 5 per cent before the downturn, households have seen a significant boost to buying power.' Hometrack said the scale of the increases in the coming months will depend on the willingness of existing home owners and investors to bid up the price of housing. Toughened mortgage rules are set to come into force next month which will mean lenders have to make sure that people can not only afford their mortgage repayments now, but also when interest rates eventually start to rise. Time frame: The length of time properties are typically spending on the market before being snapped up has dropped to just under eight weeks for the first time since 2007 . However, Hometrack pointed out that cash buyers and investors, who account for up to two fifths of sales, will not be affected by these changes. Mr Donnell said: 'The gap between supply and demand has been extended for the last five months and points to further price rises in the months ahead.' Official house price figures released by the Office for National Statistics last week showed property values rising at 6.8 per cent annually – more than five times as fast as the ONS wages measure, which is up by 1.4 per cent. In the year to January, the average home went up £17,000 to £254,000, while wages rose by just £417. Separate figures from the Land Registry on Friday showed house prices across England and Wales rose by 5.3 per cent in the year to February but prices in London soared by 13.8 per cent.","Sellers are typically getting 96.2% of their asking price, according to report .

"By . Mark Duell . A mother of two preparing a Christmas stuffing mix in her kitchen got the shock of her life when she opened a bag of herbs from Tesco and a six-legged live praying mantis jumped out at her. Linda Hebditch, 53, of Poole, Dorset, was about to chop up some sage when she found the predatory insect scurrying amongst the leaves imported from Israel in the 30g packet that cost 80p. Mrs Hebditch and her son Ryan, 16, took the exotic creature to a pet shop where it was identified as the praying mantis - and insect experts believe it got into the bag before it was imported to the UK. Shocked: Linda Hebditch (left), 53, of Poole, Dorset, was about to chop up some sage when she found a praying mantis (bottom left & right) scurrying amongst the leaves imported from Israel in the 30g packet that cost 80p . Creepy: Mrs Hebditch and her son Ryan, 16, took the exotic creature to a pet shop where it was identified as the praying mantis - and insect experts believe it got into the bag before it was imported to the UK . Tesco staff have collected the packet and launched an investigation after it was bought at a store in Poole. But the mantis is still residing with Mrs Hebditch while the family decide what to do with it. She said: ‘It absolutely scared the socks off me, my legs just turned to jelly. I thought it was just a bit of bark among the leaves, but when I went to take it out of the bowl I saw a leg move and jumped. ‘The bag says the sage was imported from Israel so it has come on a long journey. I'm not sure what we are going to do with it. I don't want to keep it here, although I think my son Ryan is in two minds.’ ‘I don't believe in killing things, hopefully the pet store will take it. It was a massive shock for me, so it could have been really awful if a frail elderly person had opened it.’ Receipt: Tesco staff have collected the packet and launched an investigation after it was bought at a store in Poole. But the mantis is still residing with Mrs Hebditch while the family decide what to do with it . Complaint: Mrs Hebditch said it was a 'horrible thought' to consider that someone else who might have opened the packet 'could have just poured it all straight into a blender' without spotting the insect . The mantis, which is not dangerous to humans, is currently residing with the Hebditch family, who are still deciding what to do with it. Mantises, who feed on insects, are widespread around the world and can be found in both tropical and temperate regions. Often called the 'praying mantis' because of its folded forelegs which they use to trap prey, there are more than 2,400 different species. During mating, the female will often devour the male in an act known as sexual cannibalism. A Giant Rainforest Mantis is pictured above. Mrs Hebditch added that it was a . ‘horrible thought’ to consider that someone else who might have opened . the packet ‘could have just poured it all straight into a blender’ without spotting the insect. Wesley Norton, who runs the Southern Aquatics pet store where Mrs Hebditch took the mantis, said he sells about 10 of the insects every month to collectors who buy different types of species. He added: ‘Mrs Hebditch's mantis is ready to breed so it is worth about £25. 'If you buy it to breed though, it is often a one-off as the female sometimes eats the head of the male during mating.’ Mrs Hebditch, who lives with her husband Martyn and sons Matthew and Ryan, complained to Tesco after finding the insect in the bag. A Tesco spokesman said: ‘We expect our food to be of the highest quality and were really concerned to hear of this matter. One of our colleagues has collected the product from the customer so we can begin an urgent investigation with the supplier.’","Linda Hebditch, 53, of Poole, Dorset, bought the sage for 80p from Tesco .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Two women are accused of showing off more than their putting skills at a public golf course. Madison County Sheriff's Capt. Mike Dixon says investigators responded to complaints of lewd behaviour Monday at the Woodlands Golf Course in Alton, Illinois, and saw the women displaying their breasts. Now, authorities in Madison County have charged 45-year-old Shelly Lewis and 43-year-old Alicia Binford of O'Fallon, Missouri, with public indecency, a misdemeanour. Not par for the course: Alicia Binford was one of two women charged with public indecency after golfers spotted them repeatedly exposing their breasts . In the drink: Shelly Lewis was also arrested for her indecent behaviour . They each posted $100 cash bond. Capt. Dixon told MailOnline that officers received complaints that the two women were repeatedly exposing their breasts in a public area of the golf course. ‘They weren’t topless in general,’ he said, ‘but they were exposing their breasts – obviously there’s a neighbourhood there, there are children around as there’s a subdivision built on the course, so there were concerns.’ It was unclear whether the women themselves were golfing, or if they were just accompanying other golfters. He said that at the time of the arrests, ‘the officers didn’t witnesses Binford and Lewis golfing, they witnessed them pulling their shirts up.’ The incident is not a common one in Madison County. When asked whether this sort of thing happens frequently, Capt. Dixon responded: ‘I can’t remember ever having an incident like that in the past. Rub of the green: The Woodlands Golf Course in Alton, Illinois is a public facility . The yips: According to Madison County police, the course was rented out by a private party . ‘Individuals who go to the golf courses are somewhat reserved. 'At least I’ve never experienced that.’ He continued: ‘It’s a public course, it’s a very nice course. As I understand it, the course was rented out during the day by a private entity.’ The captain also confirmed that the two women are indeed wearing clothes in their mug shots. 'They're wearing halter-type tops,' he said. The Riverfront Times had a theory that the women were professionals, to which Capt. Dixon responded: ‘They’re not strippers, they’re golfers.’ Binford and Lewis couldn't be reached for comment Tuesday; Binford's home telephone number has been disconnected. Lewis hasn't returned a message left at her home.

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Alabama congressional hopeful Will Brooke blows holes into a copy of the Affordable Care Act with three different guns in a new campaign ad, saying he wants to 'see how much damage we can do to this copy of Obamacare.' Before resorting to a wood chipper decorated with a campaign sticker, the Republican candidate fires at the 1,000-page health insurance law with a .40 caliber Glock pistol, a .270 caliber Cooper rifle and an AR-15. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Let's do some damage': Will Brooke has some fun exercising his Second Amendment right to shred a paper copy of Obamacare with hot lead . President Barack Obama was elected to the White House -- twice -- by promising to implement Obamacare, and now many Republicans are running on the promise of blasting it to bits . Yes, it's an AR-15: the congressional hopeful in a red state uses the much-maligned high-power rifle to blast hole after hole into the stack of paper . The Daily Caller was first to report on the controversial campaign video, but Brooke isn't the first to put guns in a political campaign ad. West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin famously blew a hole in President Obama's favored 'cap and trade' climate change bill in an ad that helped get him win a 2012 special election after the death of Sen. Robert Byrd. Manchin's home state is the nation's second-largest coal producer, trailing only Wyoming. In Alabama, Brooke is trying to appeal to voters who prize the Second Amendment and also dislike Obamacare by a massive margin. He's running to replace the retiring Rep. Spencer Bachus. In the ad, he builds a custom wooden box to serve as a target holder before shooting three guns at it. None of them is able to penetrate the entire thick stack of paper. 'For those who have already been hurt by the law here in Alabama, it's anything but funny,' says Brooke of the increasingly controversial Obamacare scheme . The final insult: All 1,000-plus pages of the Affordable Care Act go into a wood chipper . Ultimately, he resorts to using a wood chipper to shred it, while saying that 'we'll have to resort to more extreme measures to get rid of Obamacare, and replace it with a market based solution.' In a statement after the ad appeared online, he said it 'shows that we can have fun with a serious subject, but for those who have already been hurt by the law here in Alabama, it’s anything but funny.' In the June 3 primary that will likely serve as a proxy for the general election in a bright red state, Brooke will face orthopedic surgeon Chad Mathis, Alabama Policy Institute founder Gary Palmer and State Rep. Paul DeMarco.","Alabama Republican distinguishes himself in a crowded primary field by firing three guns at the Affordable Care Act .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Woody Allen, who faced sexual abuse allegations from his adopted daughter last month, is back on the big screen playing a pimp. The actor-director stars in new movie Fading Gigolo as the owner of a failing New York bookshop who bizarrely finds himself organizing a threesome between his dermatologist, her friend and his employee Fioravante (played by the movie's writer-director John Turturro) for the price of $1,000. The film, which also stars Sharon Stone, Sofia Vergara, Vanessa Paradis and Liev Schreiber, is due to be released on April 18 at limited theaters in the U.S. Scroll down to watch the trailer . Woody Allen stars as a neurotic pimp in the movie Fading Gigolo due for release in the U.S. on April 18 . The role is surprising as it is rare for Allen to star in a movie that he has not written and directed. The sexually-charged film is likely to leave many movie-goers feeling uncomfortable following recently renewed allegations against Allen, 78, by his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow that he molested her when she was seven years old. Last month, Miss Farrow insisted she will not be 'silenced' by Allen and renewed her allegations in a New York Times blog. Woody Allen's adopted daughter Dylan Farrow has accused him of sexual abuse . She wrote: 'I was seven years old, Woody Allen took me by the hand and led me into a dim, closet-like attic on the second floor of our house. He told me to lay on my stomach and play with my brother’s electric train set. 'Then he sexually assaulted me. He talked to me while he did it, whispering that I was a good girl, that this was our secret, promising that we’d go to Paris and I’d be a star in his movies.' Woody went on to defend himself against the allegations, publicly denying being a child abuser and accusing his ex-partner Mia Farrow of being spiteful and malevolent via a letter published in the New York Times, which he said would be his 'final word' on the matter. In the letter he raised the findings . of a panel of experts used during the investigation into the claims, who . found no evidence of abuse. He . said: 'Of course, I did not molest Dylan. I loved her and hope one day . she will grasp how she has been cheated out of having a lov­ing father . and exploited by a moth­er more interested in her own fester­ing anger . than her daughter’s well-being.' Allen was never charged with child sex abuse. He insists that his former partner Mia Farrow 'implanted' false memories into Dylan's consciousness to pay him back for falling in love and marrying Farrow's adopted daughter Soon-Yi Previn. Mia and Woody were still together when he fell for Miss Previn, when he was 56 years old and she was around the age of 19. Allen's new film goes touches on familiar themes of his multitudinous projects including repressed sexuality, sexual perversions and late-in-life disappointments. There are jokes about his character's attempt at a threesome in the Seventies, failed sexual encounters and Vergara being a 'miracle of physics'. In one scene, Allen's character wanders a lingerie store admiring panties and suspenders while in another he openly ogles women in the park to bring home for his 'ho' Fioravante to have sex with. Fading Gigolo, with its cast of A-listers, is due for limited release in the U.S. on April 18 . Woody initially faced sexual abuse allegations over Dylan Farrow in 1992 during a custody battle with his former partner Mia Farrow, but they were later dropped without charge. Allen received his 24th Oscar nomination at this year's Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay for his 2013 film Blue Jasmine. The movie's lead actor Cate Blanchett received the Best Actress award for her role as narcissistic down-on-her-luck socialite Jasmine.

"By . Tara Brady . A new mother and her baby girl lay dead together alone for up to three weeks because no one tried to open their unlocked front door. Joanne Thomas, 27, was found with four-month-old Harper after neighbours, friends and a social worker all walked away from her home when she failed to answer. But an inquest heard that when police were finally called to the house they opened the unlocked front door straight away by simply trying the handle. A new mother and her baby girl lay dead together alone for up to three weeks after no one tried to open their unlocked front door . Miss Thomas and little Harper lived alone and mystery surrounds why they died. The pair were meant to be seen by social services to check on their progress after Miss Thomas separated from her partner. The inquest heard how mother and baby were said to be 'comfortable and happy' and were not a concern to health visitors. However, a social worker failed to see or hear from Miss Thomas after calling on her three separate times because they didn’t try to answer the door. Miss Thomas and little Harper lived alone and mystery surrounds the reasons surrounding their deaths . Neighbours became so concerned they stood on a bin to looking through a bedroom window which is when they made the horrific discovery. They immediately called police who opened the unlocked front door on arrival and walked straight into the house. Social worker Jamie Robins told the inquest: 'It was up to me to visit the family on a regular basis and address any support they needed. 'They were happy and comfortable - there was nothing to be concerned about.' Mr Robins said he visited Miss Thomas's home in Troedyrhiw near Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, three times in the weeks before they were discovered dead.

He said: 'I went back and explained to my line manager that the mother and child had not been seen for a number of weeks.' Mr Robins said he also sent letters to her home and tried to contact Miss Thomas's family. Her mother Iris Thomas said she visited her and her grandchild every weekend and last saw her four weeks before the discovery of their bodies. She said: 'I rang her the following Friday and she told me there was no need to come - that was the last time I ever spoke to her. 'We would text all the time but it was not unusual for Joanne not to speak or have contact with me for a week or 10 days.' Miss Thomas's sister Rachel Lewis said she last saw her while shopping with baby Harper in a push chair. She said: 'She said she wan’t feeling very well but there was no cause for concern. She was just looking a bit drained.' Aberdare coroners court was told Miss Thomas cancelled her appointment with a community health worker a month before she was discovered dead.

The inquest was told the cause of Miss Thomas and baby Harper’s deaths were a complete mystery. Police found a quantity of blood in the bedroom, on the banister and in a saucepan on the bedroom floor. But foul play was ruled out by police after a post-mortem examnination revealed Miss Thomas had been vomiting blood due to a stomach illness. Carbon monoxide poisoning was ruled out after tests were carried out on all the gas and heating appliances in the house and none were found to be faulty. Tragic: Joanne Thomas who was found dead with baby Harper at her home near Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales . Another mystery surrounding the deaths was revealed by baby Harper being found in a unsoiled nappy. Pathologist Dr Stephen Leadbetter said because of the lapse in time in discovering mother and daughter it was 'impossible' to give a medical cause of death. Detective Inspector Tudor Thomas, of South Wales Police, said: 'There was no one else involved, carbon monoxide was not involved, and it was not an overdose. 'I am unable to give a clear explanation of what caused Joannes death.' A young man holds his head in his hands as he leaves flowers and a teddy bear outside the house where the mother and baby were found and Joanne's mother Iris (right) with Harper . Glamorgan Valleys coroner Andrew Barkley said there was no evidence Joanne had taken her own life and foul play had been ruled out by the police. He described it as an unusual, upsetting and tragic case. Mr Barkley said: 'There was also no evidence that Harper was given any drugs prior to her death.'The cause of the deaths of Joanne and Harper are unascertained. Having considered all the possibilities there remains real doubt.' He recorded an open verdict on the deaths of mother and baby. After the hearing tearful sister Rachel said: 'We still don’t know how either of them died. 'It’s a tragedy and we don’t know how any of us are going to get over it.'","Joanne Thomas was found with baby Harper in Troedyrhiw, Wales .

"By . Associated Press . After a rescue worker called her animal clinic saying dogs had been extracted from the destruction left behind by a massive Washington mudslide, veterinary assistant Cassna Wemple and her colleagues raced to this small down near the debris field. They found one of the dogs at the fire station among a flurry of rescue workers and townspeople. Bonnie, an Australian shepherd, was wrapped in a comforter. She was muddy, and had a broken leg in a splint. One of Bonnie's owners had just died in the slide. The other had been pulled out. Rescued horses at the Darrington Rodeo Grounds when it opened last Thursday to care for animals in the aftermath of the mudslide . 'She was just very much in shock,' Wemple said. In this rural community north of Seattle, Wemple said it's common for residents to have plenty of animals, including pigs, horses, rabbits, chickens, dogs and cats. When the deadly slide struck March 22, beloved pets and livestock also perished. The full number of pets and livestock killed may never be known. Authorities also don't have a clear number of how many pets are missing or displaced by the slide, incident spokespeople have said. There are at least 37 horses displaced and at least 10 dogs that were missing, according to different animal services helping the recovery efforts. 'To know that their animals are lost and may or may not be found. It's heart breaking. It's heart breaking for the people and the animals,' said Dee Cordell of the Everett Animal Services. Wemple said rescue workers could hear horses crying from the debris hours after the slide, but because of the unsafe conditions, rescuers couldn't go in. For those animals that survived, the community and outsiders have rallied in support with donations. Bag after bag of food for dogs, cats and chickens have filled up the rodeo grounds outside Darrington, which is serving as a makeshift shelter. At last count, it totaled nearly 45,000 pounds. On Saturday alone, 27 tons of donated food from Purina arrived. People carry bags of feed for the rescued horses and ponies taken to the Darrington Rodeo grounds on March 27 in Washington . Lilianna Andrews's seven horses are now at the rodeo grounds. Their house wasn't buried in the mud, but the displaced earth formed a dam, backing up the Stillaguamish River into a lake that rose waist-high in the house and as high as 10 feet in the barn. 'We got them out before they got any water on them,' the 13-year-old said after helping unload hay at the rodeo grounds on Saturday. 'But they would have drowned. So we just had to evacuate them from the water, and they've been staying here ever since.' The Andrews were in Seattle when a friend called to check on their whereabouts. When they realized it wasn't just a small mudslide blocking the road, they hurried home. Their dog, cats and chickens are fine too, Andrews said, although they haven't been able to get in to feed the chickens. Tom Gent, and his dog Tiny, in Darrington where he is caring for animals displaced by the devastating mud slide in Snohomish County . Volunteers are also tending to 20 horses that belonged to Summer Raffo, a farrier who died in the slide. Wemple's clinic, Chuckanut Valley Veterinary, treated three dogs hurt from the slide. One of those dogs, named Blue, had to have one of his legs amputated last week. His owner is still hospitalized. The owner's daughter has visited the dog daily. 'He'll be happier in the long run. No more pain in that leg,' Wemple said. Bonnie's owner was Linda McPherson, a well-known retired librarian. She was in her living room reading newspapers with her husband, Gary 'Mac' McPherson, when the slide hit. She died. He lived. Bonnie has been kept at the clinic for rehabilitation. At night, one of the staffers takes her home. A memorial is planned for next week for Linda McPherson. Wemple said the staffer will bring the Australian shepherd to the memorial for a reunion with her surviving owner.","There are at least 37 horses displaced and at least 10 dogs that were missing following the deadly mudslide in Snohomish County .

"By . Candace Sutton In Malaysia . As a schoolboy, the captain of Flight MH370 was enigmatic, a bit of a mystery and regarded as a very bright young man. 'He was always on the ball and spent most of his time in the library,' Malaysian Airlines captain Abdul Manaf Hasan told the MailOnline. Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah is pictured in his science class photograph looking relaxed among a smiling group of young Malaysian students in the late 1970s, reported Metro news. Enigmatic and bookish: Manaf Hasan, a pilot friend of Flight MH370 Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, said he was a bit mysterious and spent most of his time in the library during his college days . Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah is said to have been left distraught by his wife's decision to move out of the family home in an upmarket Kuala Lumpur suburb . His name misspelled as 'Zahari', the future Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 captain wears a pair of long flared pants in a group of Year 11 science students in 1978 at Penang Free School in northern Malaysia. Zaharie had enrolled in the school - the oldest independent college in South East Asia - after passing the qualifying exam in the same year. School headmaster, Jalil Saad, who was two years ahead of Zaharie at the school, described him as 'well liked' and 'a book worm' who did not deserve accusations of terrorism in the wake of the disappearance of the plane he piloted. Zaharie was 'studious,' he said. The Penang Free School's senior administration assistant Ho Nean Chan said he and Zaharie had studied science alongside each other, and that 'he was a smart student.â€™ . Jalil Saad said all the school's 'old boys' were regarded 'as brothers' and had remained in touch with each other. Following the MH370 incident, the Penang Free School has held prayer meetings. 'We join the nation in grieving for the loss of all on board the jet liner,' Ho Nean Chan said. Captain Manaf said he did not know Captain Zaharie's 'personal  situation' but that he had been 'impeccable' and the missing pilot's fellow flight captains were dismayed by reports speculating about his potential as a terrorist or suicide bomber. 'None of us believe he has done it,' Capt Manaf said. 'I stand by my friend.' Ahmad Seth, Shah's youngest son, also came out in support of his father this week, saying he has 'ignored all the speculation' around his 53-year-old father since the plane mysteriously disappeared en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur 19 days ago. The 26-year-old said the family has yet to accept the official ruling that all 239 people on board are dead, insisting they will wait for physical evidence, as searches were today suspended when heavy rain, winds and low clouds forced aircraft to return to base. Ahmad Seth Zaharie with his sister Aishah Zaharie, left, and their mother, Faizah Khanum Mustafa Khan, says he knows his father 'better' and has ignored all the speculation about his role in the fate of MH370 . The 53-year-old pilot had been under suspicion after investigators discovered the simulator at his Kuala Lumpur home. Teams seized the equipment and took it apart piece by piece to look for clues as to what happened to missing flight MH370 . 'I've read everything online. But I've ignored all the speculation,' he told the New Strait Times. It comes amid reports that investigators now believe Captain Zaharie is solely responsible for the Malaysian Airline jet's demise and have dismissed the likelihood of mechanical failure or a hijacking. A high-ranking official told USA Today that Captain Zaharie's family is being scrutinized in the hope of shedding some light on the tragedy. A friend of the pilot has revealed Captain Zaharie was in 'no state of mind to be flying' and had been left distraught by his wife's decision to move out of the family home. â€˜He's one of the finest pilots around and I'm no medical expert, but with all that was happening in his life Zaharie was probably in no state of mind to be flying,â€™ he told the NZ Herald on the condition of anonymity. He said his friend's relationships were breaking down, adding it was possible Captain Zaharie took MH370 for a 'last joyride' in which he tried high-risk maneuvers he had perfected on his beloved home-made flight simulator. Aerial sweeps of the southern Indian Ocean for debris were suspended Thursday as adverse weather conditions forced the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) to recall 11 search aircraft to Perth. But five ships will remain in the 78,000-square-kilometre search area and continue to follow a new lead from French satellite images dated March 23 that showed 122 objects floating in the area more than 1,243miles off Australia's west coast. An aviation meteorologist told the MailOnline that deteriorating weather was expected to make life difficult for military and civilian search personnel, and warned further delays were expected in the coming days. A relative (centre) of a passenger aboard Malaysia Airlines MH370 enters a meeting room with volunteers from Malaysia (in blue vests) at the Lido Hotel in Beijing . Able Seaman Kurt Jackson keeps watch on the forecastle of the Royal Australian Navy ship HMAS Success during a search for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 . A U.S. Navy Poseidon P8 maritime surveillance aircraft is refuelled for flight just before being grounded at Perth International Airport . Republic of Korea Navy (ROKN) personnel unload a P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft at the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Base Pearce, before flying over the southern Indian Ocean to participate in the search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 . Aviation meteorologist Martin Babakhan said a front of warm air was moving into the cold search area, causing a thick, wall-like band of low cloud cover. 'When you have those sorts of front mixing in with the cooler temperatures from the ocean, the result is it creates high-level moisture - or 100 per cent humidity,' he told the MailOnline. 'Visibility is completely restricted for those aircraft out there. When these types of weather conditions occur at Sydney Airport, for example, the plane is switched into auto-pilot and GPS is used to land the plane automatically. 'You just can't do that out there over the ocean - it's a completely different environment. Even trying to fly underneath the cloud cover presents a safety risk, that's why they don't do it.' Mr Babakhan said the visibility issues would linger for approximately 24 hours before conditions begin to improve. He said AMSA would most likely call the ships back later Thursday as the swell becomes more aggressive in the search area. 'The waves will definitely start to get bigger as a result of the front moving through,' he said. 'We're talking about them ranging from three metres up to seven metres. 'It's very unlikely they will be able to find anything in those conditions until at least Saturday or Sunday.' French satellite images from March 23 have spotted 122 objects floating in a 155-square-mile area . Eleven aircraft and five ships were leading the recovery mission on Thursday, but they face a race against time as adverse weather conditions may again halt the search . The Malaysian Minister of Defence and acting Transport Minister Dato Seri Hishammuddin Hussein shows the pictures of the possible debris of the flight MH370 at a press conference . The location of potential objects related to the search of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 debris was shown by the Malaysian Remote Sensing Agency (MRSA) Malaysia's acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein revealed Wednesday that the news satellite images have dramatically narrowed the search zone, with the debris spotted across an area measuring just 155 square miles. Mr Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference that the images were captured by France-based Airbus Defense and Space on March 23. They are the fourth set of satellite images to show potential debris from Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 in a remote part of the Indian Ocean roughly 1,550 miles south west of Perth. The objects are believed to be solid and range from three to 75 feet long.","Captain Abdul Manaf Hasan told the MailOnline Zaharie Ahmad Shah spent most of his time in the library while attending Penang Free School .

"By . Lydia Warren . Virginia Senator Creigh Deeds today showed how he is continuing to heal four months after his son brutally stabbed him before killing himself at the family's home. But speaking at the National Press Club, the 56-year-old admitted that the red scars across his face have helped him remind fellow politicians of the importance of mental healthcare reform in his state. 'Nobody lost sight of our incredible . needs in the area of mental health, not this session when I was there . every day with scars and tears,' he told the crowd in Washington, D.C. 'I was red-eyed and red-faced â€“ that kept it in the forefront. My scars aren't going away.' Healing: Virginia State Senator Creigh Deeds speaks at the National Press Club in Washington on Monday showing the scars inflicted by his son, who had been turned away from psychiatric care the day before . Fighter: Deeds, pictured on Monday, is now pushing the Virginia legislature for mental health-care reform . Deeds was attacked by his 24-year-old son, Gus, on November 19 - just a day after he was turned away from state-run psychiatric care. Gus, a talented musician and top student at William and . Mary, was diagnosed as bipolar when he was 21, and last November his . father became worried he would kill himself. He gained a court . order to take his son to the emergency room to check him into a . psychiatric ward, but the court order expired after six hours. In that . time, staff had not been able to find him a bed. So instead, he was simply sent home with his father, which concerned Deeds. Deeds woke up the next day expecting his son to be upset, but he never could have imagined the violent scene that followed. Together: Gus, pictured left in 2009 with his father, had been diagnosed as bipolar when he was 21 . Close: Deeds' son Gus was a prominent fixture on his failed gubernatorial campaign in 2009, pictured . Rural: The attack took place in Deeds' Millboro, Virginia home, pictured. The senator was able to stumble to the road where he was found by a neighbor - but his son went back to the house and shot himself dead . 'I . got ready for work, and I went out to the barn to feed the horses, and . Gus was coming across the yard and... I said, ""Hey, bud, how'd you . sleep?""' he told CBS earlier this year. 'He said, ""Fine."" 'I turned my back and... had this feed thing in my hands and he was just on me... He got me twice.' In fact, Deeds suffered 10 stab wound, including those to his face. Following . the frenzied attack, Deeds stumbled into the road where he was found by . a neighbor and rushed to hospital. But his son returned to the house . and shot himself dead. Despite the attack, on Monday, Deeds fought back the tears as he said that he refused to blame his 'perfect son' for the incident. Determined: Deeds' scars are much more prominent as he appears outside the Senate Education and Health Subcommittee on Mental Health in January. He is fighting to improve mental health-care standards . Determined: On Monday, he said that the scars made it hard for lawmakers to forget the issue . 'In every sense of the word my son was my hero,' Deeds said, explaining how kind and smart his son was. 'I think what happened was a system failure.' He went on: 'Events last fall took my son, but I survived. I hope the result of my surviving is that my son will remembered for his living, not his dying,' he said, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. Since returning to work, Deeds has pushed through the implementation of an online registry showing available spaces in Virginia facilities. If a private facility bed canâ€™t be found, a hospital bed must . be. A four-year study of Virigina's mental health . system is also being carried out. Deeds also said there national issues need to be addressed, including medical confidentiality laws that prevented him from knowing the details of his son's diagnosis and treatment.","Deeds said in an appearance in D.C. on Monday that his scars have reminded politicians of the importance of mental health-care reform .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . The Department of Homeland Security released so-called 'criminal aliens' – people living in the U.S. illegally who have been convicted of crimes – at a record pace in 2013. Internal DHS documents obtained by the right-leaning Center for Immigration Studies show that last year the agency's Immigration and Customs Enforcement division encountered 722,000 potentially deportable illegal immigrants, but charged just 195,000 with immigration violations. And 68,000 of those who were released back in to the U.S. population already had criminal convictions that would warrant their expulsion from the country. But President Barack Obama's . preferred policy has favored 'prosecutorial discretion,' giving ICE . broad authority to pick and choose which aliens to keep and . which to cut loose. Coming home to roost? Immigration protesters like this group in Alabama have pushed for policy changes that give special treatment to illegal immigrants in a broad list of categories, inevitably letting countless genuine criminals slip through the cracks . President Barack Obama has presided over a policy shift that has given his Homeland Security agency 'prosecutorial discretion' in handling illegal immigrants, a policy many Republicans believe is intended to make citizenship options the only viable alternative . ICE keeps some of them in detention . facilities, but releases others who fit their 'discretion' guidelines . despite their criminal profiles. About 75 per cent of those detained by ICE in 2013 had already been convicted or criminal or immigration crimes serious enough to require them – by law – to remain in custody. Most of those criminal aliens found themselves in ICE's holding cells after local authorities jailed them pending trial for unrelated offenses. Many of those who were ultimately released never returned to face their immigration cases or other criminal charges, instead fleeing to other jurisdictions or back to their home countries. The Center for Immigration Studies report claims that '[a]ccording to ICE personnel, the vast gap between the number of encounters reported and the number of aliens put on the path to removal exists because officers are not permitted to file charges against aliens who do not fall into the administration’s narrowly defined criteria for enforcement, regardless of the criminal charges or the circumstances in which the alien was identified.' Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions, a frequent immigration hawk who opposes loosening policies and putting illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship, lashed out at the White House on Monday. 'The preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that immigration enforcement in America has collapsed,' Sessions said. 'Even those with criminal convictions are being released. DHS is a department in crisis. Secretary Johnson must reject the President’s demands to weaken enforcement further and tell him that his duty, and his officers’ duty, is to enforce the law – not break it.' He added a charge that the Obama administration has 'adopted a government policy that encourages new arrivals to enter illegally or overstay visas by advertising immunity from future enforcement.' Mexican nationals and people from other countries continue to cultivate new ways to sneak into the United States, often for work. This trio was spotted hiding in a storage compartment under the bed of a recreational vehicle. 'The preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that immigration enforcement in America has collapsed,' says Alabama Republican Senator Jeff Sessions . According to DHS, more than 870,000 illegal immigrants are on lists ordering their deportation, but have defied authorities by becoming fugitives. In one infamous case, Chicago police arrested Amado Espinoza-Ramirez, a Mexican national whose final charging sheet accused him of sexual assault involving a minor less than thirteen years old, sexual relations with a family member, and forcible sexual assault. Amado Espinoza-Ramirez still stands charged with multiple counts of child rape against a member of his own family. ICE let him go under a policy that affords preference to illegal immigrants who are responsible for the care of minor children. The 42 charges weren't all filed immediately, so a judge granted him a $100,000 bond. A friend bailed him out for $10,000, but ICE took custody. Seeing that he was officially a caregiver for a minor child – one of the categories of prosecutorial discretion in the White House's guidelines – the agency released him with a summons to appear in immigration court later. That minor was likely the young child Espinoza-Ramirez allegedly raped. He never returned to face his charges, either in criminal court or in immigration proceedings. The case of Cook County, Illinois is indicative of nationwide problems, but ICE agents face an extra hurdle there: Since Chicago declared itself a 'sanctuary' city in 2011, the Cook County jail has closed its doors to federal immigration authorities. The Daily Caller reported in 2012 that federal agents can no longer interview the county jail's inmates to determine whether they should be flagged for 'removal' – deportation i or other immigration proceedings. Saul Chavez, a Chicago-area illegal immigrant who with a drunk driving conviction already on his record, fled that year to avoid facing a felony charge of vehicular homicide. Charging documents showed that Chavez was drunk when he plowed his car into a 66-year-old man who was crossing the street, dragging him about two hundred feet. ICE placed a 'detainer' on Chavez after he was jailed, ordering his continued detention even if he made bail. But Cook County ignored the directive. When Chavez found enough money to post bond five months after his arrest, he walked out of the jail, never to return. Immigration officials have complained about a lack of bed space in detention facilities for the annual crush of detainees they process. But for the last three years, the Department of Homeland Security has consistently decreased the number of beds covered in its annual budget requests. The Center ofr Immigration Studies reported Monday that 'despite claims of a focus on public safety, the administration’s prosecutorial discretion criteria are allowing factors such as family relationships, political considerations, or attention from advocacy groups to trump criminal convictions as a factor leading to deportation.'","The Department of Homeland Security is letting illegal immigrants go in record numbers, including those already convicted of serious crimes .
A man accused of raping a child in his own family was released, apparently because of a policy of 'discretion' when suspects are child caregivers .
Another man facing vehicular homicide charges walked away because Chicago's county jail officials refused to let the feds interview him .
According to a new report, just 195,000 out of 722,000 illegal immigrants encountered by ICE were charged with immigration violations in 2013 ."

"By . Luke Garratt . The U.S. State Department has defended spending $400,000 on a life-size sculpture of a camel staring through the eye of an over-sized needle for its embassy in Pakistan, claiming that the price of the artwork was ‘reasonable’ and it reflected ‘the values of a predominantly Islamist country’. The work is by noted American artist . John Baldessari, and depicts a New Testament and Qur'an phrase about the . difficulty those who are wealthy have in entering heaven. The white fibreglass sculpture appropriately named 'Camel Contemplating Needle' costs more than 320 times what the average Pakistan citizen earns in a year. The white fibreglass sculpture . appropriately named 'Camel Contemplating Needle' costs more than 320 . times what the average Pakistan citizen earns in a year . The taxpayer expense for the camel was found on the contracting documents, which consisted of four pages justifying a 'sole source' procurement for the sculpture. It says: 'This artist's product is uniquely qualified. 'Public art which will be presented in the new embassy should reflect the values of a predominantly Islamist country.' The document justifies the use of artist John Baldessari in the four page contracting document by citing his Wikipedia entry, which said: 'John Anthony Baldessari (born June 17, 1931) is an American conceptual . artist known for his work featuring found photography and appropriated . images.' The U.S State Department's press spokeswoman, Christine Foushee, said: 'The proposed purchase comes from the department’s “Office of Art in . Embassies.” 'In new construction projects, a small part of the . total funds, about 0.5%, is spent on art purchases.' The statue, 'Camel Contemplating Needle' will be featured outside of the new U.S. embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan, which will replace the old embassy (pictured) Steven Beyer, of Beyer projects, the art dealer for the project, told BuzzFeed that the U.S. government reached out to his company. He said: 'They approached us. We were, of course, quite surprised. 'The $400,000 price tag is actually a very a reduced price for this . sculpture, there is an art market that makes these prices, . and this is one of the most prominent American artists. 'It depends on what part of the public you are in...if you go . to the museum and enjoy art and are moved by it, things cost what they . cost.'

"By . Martin Robinson . Row: This poster has been pulled by the students' union at the University of Kent after claims it legitimised rape . A students' union has been forced to pull down posters promoting its summer ball after complaints it encouraged the rape of vulnerable young women. Kent Union, based at the University of Kent, used an image of a female student alone in the dark with the caption: 'Someone will lose their friends' to sell tickets for its Party in the Car Park event in June. Critics said it suggested young women attending the event would be 'fair game'. The National Union of Students has called the poster 'disgusting' and it led to a campaign by students to have it . removed from the Canterbury campus. It has also emerged that the photo used was from last year's ball and put on the poster without the young woman's permission. The former student, named only as Kate, tweeted after seeing the poster: '@KentUnion So clearly I'm fair game . without those pesky protective friends. Love from: Girl In The Photo'. Student Bethany Taylor, 20, who is women's campaign officer for the Union said: 'When I first saw it, I was disgusted. I think it's really harrowing for women students in particular who may have been attacked or had a bad experience on campus. 'A lot of students, both male and female, find it quite disturbing. The picture was also used without the consent of the girl featured. It only shows her body, which objectifies her.' Upset: The young woman in the image, a former student, also criticised the campaign, which used a photo of her without her permission . Today the Union apologised to anyone it had offended. 'We would like to sincerely apologise to the students that have been offended by one of the posters we have designed to promote this yearâ€™s Party in the Car Park. It was never our intention for the poster and its message to be interpreted in this way,' a spokesman said. 'The concept behind our marketing of the event is to use real photographs taken last year combined with factual statements provided by students. 'We can confirm that the poster has been removed and will not be used within any further marketing. In the future we will check our designs with relevant people to ensure they cannot be interpreted in a different way'.","Kent Union pull poster after complaints from students and women's groups .

"EXCLUSIVE By . Hugo Gye . The BBC spends more than £20,000 a year on buying TV licences for its offices, MailOnline can reveal. The Corporation pays the money to outsourcing giant Capita, which then gives it back to the BBC to fund its programming. Campaigners described the situation as 'ridiculous', and called on the BBC to stop wasting resources by needlessly paying thousands of pounds to itself. Payments: The BBC spends more than £20,000 a year on the licence fee so employees can watch TV at work . Despite being the sole beneficiary of the licence fee, the BBC is still liable to pay the charge for all of its offices and studios which have televisions installed. The Corporation spent a total of £20,224.50 on the licence fee in the financial year 2012-13, according to data obtained through a Freedom of Information request. That figure does not include the BBC's commercial properties such as BBC Worldwide and UKTV. In addition, the Corporation admitted that separate departments may hold additional TV licences, but claimed that it would take too much work to find out how much they spent. A spokesman for the BBC told MailOnline: 'The BBC, in common with other large businesses, holds licences designed specifically for organisations with multiple sites and it pays the full licence fee for each of its sites.' Charge: The licence fee is collected by outsourcing firm Capita before being paid to the Corporation . The bill of £20,224.50 covers the cost of 139 individual licences, at a price of £145.50 each. Dia Chakravarty of the TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'This ridiculous situation means that licence fee payers are paying the BBC to pay the licence fee for their employees. 'It's yet another example of public sector inefficiency which leads to higher bills for hard-pressed taxpayers picking up the tab. The BBC should look into it urgently and end this practice.' Large organisations like the BBC are eligible to buy a 'company group TV licence', allowing them to pay for multiple premises under a single licence. The Corporation does not get a discount on the licence fee - the only purpose of which is to fund BBC television, radio and online services. Critics: BBC stars such as John Humphrys and Jeremy Paxman have spoken out against bureaucracy . The . television licence fee is at the centre of political debate about the . future of the BBC ahead of the expiry of the Corporation's current Royal . Charter in 2016. Some campaigners argue that it is unfair to levy a fee on all TV viewers which goes solely to one broadcaster. This . week, MPs voted to end the threat of jail for people who do not pay the . licence fee, meaning that in future fee-dodgers will only be subject to . a fine. Dozens of people are imprisoned every year for refusing to pay fines imposed by courts after they fail to buy a TV licence. When . the BBC's Royal Charter is renegotiated in two years' time, it could face . calls to share licence fee revenue with other broadcasters such as . Channel 4 or local news outlets. The cost of the licence fee has been frozen at £145.50 since 2011, with the BBC collecting a total of £3.7billion in 2012-13. The BBC is responsible for collecting . and administering the licence fee, but the job is contracted out to . Capita, Britain's largest outsourcing firm. Capita is paid up to £100million for . collecting payments from television viewers, and has been accused of . overly aggressive techniques, including sending threatening letters to . households even if they do not actually possess a TV. According to the BBC, the cost of collecting the fee amounts to 3.4 per cent of the total revenue paid in by viewers. The disclosure that the BBC spends thousands of pounds paying the licence fee, before being given the money back again, is likely to fuel the debate over the level of bureaucracy at the Corporation. Leading presenters such as Jeremy Paxman and John Humphrys have publicly lambasted the 'box-ticking' culture of the BBC, which has 23,000 employees and an annual budget of more than £5billion. Mr Humphrys suggested earlier this year that the Corporation should shrink by a third, adding: 'We could cut out layers of bureaucracy and still produce the news.' Mr Paxman, the host of Newsnight, was equally scathing when he gave evidence to an internal inquiry last year, saying of one department: 'I don't know what they do. I mean, they talk to each other, I suppose, as all these bloody people do.'","BBC spent £20,224.50 on the TV licence fee in 2012-13 .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Planning permission has been granted for a 100-seat dining room and facilities for business meetings at HMP Brixton . With its famous market and vibrant street-food, Brixton is a well established haunt for foodies from across London. From simple pizzas to meatballs in monkey gland sauce, food and flavours from around the world are available to tempt the taste buds. But one charity is about to open a eatery that will be unfamiliar to even the most seasoned gourmet: a restaurant in a prison. The Clink Charity has been given planning permission to convert the former Regency Roadhouse, which was the old Governor's house at Brixton Prison, into a 100-seat high quality diner. Prisoners will then be trained to serve customers, providing them with invaluable skills to help them become employable once they are released. Chris Moore, chief executive of The Clink Charity believes Brixton will cement the future for further Clink restaurants. He said: 'Brixton was the perfect site for our next restaurant. 'HMP . Brixton is undergoing a regeneration project and was looking for an . organisation to work with to develop the building into an opportunity . for rehabilitation. 'The central location lends itself to . securing support from local businesses and members of the public, . providing they are committed to The Clink's vision and once the . necessary security checks have been processed, providing real-life . experience for those prisoners who make it through the selection process . to join the programme.'

"By . Hugo Gye . A scandal-hit ambulance service has been criticised for spending nearly £250,000 on PR staff to defend its reputation. Dozens of patients have died in 'unexpected or avoidable' circumstances while being attended to by the East of England Ambulance Service. But last year, the trust spent £5,000 a week on five members of staff in its PR department, whose job is to respond to criticism and promote the service's image. Criticism: East of England Ambulance Service spent £250,000 on PR last year (file photo) The EEAST covers a population of 5.8million in Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Norfolk and Suffolk. It has been accused of poor performance, which may have contributed to patients' deaths, while a report this year found that its response times were unacceptably slow. The trust spent a total of £247,406 on staffing its PR operations, a sum which local MP Dan Poulter, who is also a GP, described as 'extraordinary'. 'What is particularly distressing about this is that the East of England Service has a track record of failing to invest in the right areas,' said Dr Poulter, MP for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich. '£250,000 could pay for 10 paramedics working on the ground, so they need to have a serious re-think about how they spend their money.' Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers' Alliance, added: 'It's a ludicrous amount of money. What people want is an effective and efficient ambulance service - not a highly-paid communications team spinning the news.' Victims: 14-year-old Elouise Keeling, left, and infant Bella Hellings, right, both died before an ambulance could arrive at the scene . A spokesman for the EEAST said: 'The communications team has already been reduced by more than £50,000 which will be put into front-line services and we are reviewing all of our support services. 'The communication team provide a vital reference point for patients, stakeholders and the media, raising awareness of the work of the ambulance service.' Earlier this year, NHS figures revealed that the trust had been implicated in 155 'serious incidents' since April 2010. Of those, 59 related to the unexpected or avoidable death of a patient - although the trust insisted that it was not responsible for the deaths. After the trust was publicly criticised by MPs at a Parliamentary hearing, five non-executive directors resigned and new plans to improve the service were put into place. A report in January concluded that the service had got better in some ways, but ruled that its response times were still unacceptably poor. Chief executive Anthony Marsh, who was hired in December, this week announced that more ambulances would be introduced and resources shifted from the back office to frontline services. The trust's total budget came to £226million during the fiscal year 2012/13. Tragic: Peter Nelson died from a brain haemorrhage as his parents waited for an ambulance . Peter Nelson, 26, died from a brain haemorrhage after an ambulance took two hours to reach his home. In . November, the 26-year-old collapsed in his bathroom in the village of .

They dialled . 999 at 11.15pm but an ambulance did not arrive until after 1am - taking more than six times longer than targets dictate. By the time he arrived at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, nothing could be done to save his life. In September, the East of England Ambulance Trust was branded chaotic by a coroner investigating the death of three-month-old Bella Hellings.

"By . Lucy Crossley . Many visitors see them as harmless symbols of eternal romance, but there is a growing campaign to stop lovers attaching padlocks engraved with their names to bridges in Paris. Since the early 2000s, couples have been leaving 'love locks' bearing their names or initials on a number of bridges across Europe, and throwing the key into the rivers as a sign of their devotion. However, with some of Paris's most picturesque routes over the Seine now covered in the padlocks, a campaign has started to ban the practice, amid fears that the weight of the locks could be putting some of the French capital's landmarks at risk. Bridge too far: The No Love Locks campaign has been set up to ban couples from leaving padlocks bearing their names or initials on bridges in Paris, such as the Pont des Arts (pictured) and throwing the keys into the Seine . Set up by two American ex-pats living in the city, the No Love Locks campaign is calling on the newly-elected mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, to outlaw love locks, which organisers describe as 'a plague on our city's historic bridges and sites'. An online petition set up by Lisa Anselmo and Lisa Taylor-Huff has garnered more than 1,900 signatures since it went live at the start of this month, with Parisians and tourists alike joining the calls for the locks to be banned. Among the bridges baring the weight of thousands of padlocks are the Pont des Arts, and the narrower Pont de l'Archevêché, where love locks started appearing in 2010 after padlocks were removed from the Pont des Arts by an art student for a sculpture. Ms Anselmo said she was prompted to start her campaign in November, after noticing that the Pont de l’Archevêché, which connects Notre Dame with the Quai de Montebello, had fallen prey to love locks. No love lost: Ms Anselmo started the campaign to ban the locks after noticing that the Pont de l¿Archevêché, which connects Notre Dame with the Quai de Montebello had fallen prey to love locks . 'It had been inundated by an infestation of locks, a dense metallic clump of “love,” that crept over the side of the bridge like a fungus,' she said on the campaign's blog. 'And the size of some locks was shocking—huge, some up to four inches across. Heavy bike locks had been attached to the bridge, seemingly to create an additional surface for hanging more locks since all the available meshing was used up. 'Graffiti had sprouted on the stone wall where locks were unable to be attached. People had taken to scratching messages in the paint on the railing. 'This wasn’t love. It felt like madness, like an invading army had seized the bridge. I’d known the Pont des Arts was falling prey to this mania, but now this bridge? I became like a crazy person. This was a bridge too far.' Writer and singer Ms Anselmo, who moved to Paris in 2012, was even more incensed to find that the Pont de l’Archevêché had been nicknamed 'Love Lock Bridge', and was being advertised as such to tourists, as well as on Google maps. 'It had been inundated by an infestation of locks, a dense metallic clump of ""love"" that crept over the side of the bridge like a fungus' Lisa Anselmo . After joining forces with writer Ms Taylor-Huff, she started the campaign and petition, calling on the Mayor of Paris, the 20 arrondissement mayors and the city council for a ban to be made law so the bridges can be returned to their 'original beauty and purpose'. They already have the backing of the mayor of the 6th arrondissement, Jean-Pierre Lecoq, who has described the locks as 'madness', and has expressed fears that a lock could fall onto a passing tourist boat travelling underneath one of the bridges, potentially injuring a passenger. Ms Anselmo and Ms Taylor-Huff say there are now approximately 700,000 of the locks in Paris, including some which have started appearing on lampposts, and estimate that the additional weight of the padlocks on each metre of grillwork would be around 300kg, or 660lbs. They say this is putting the structures at risk, with the Pont des Arts carrying an extra 93 tonnes of weight, and the Pont de l'Archevêché an extra 40 tonnes, as well as the locks becoming an eyesore. 'The Pont des Arts is just a little footbridge and is now holding 93 metric tonnes from the locks; regularly the grill work collapses,' Ms Anselmo told the Guardian. 'The city replaces it and two weeks later it fills up again. Sadly a ban seems to be the only way.' On lock down: Two years ago Dublin City Council removed padlocks from the Ha'penny Bridge over the River Liffey . Concerns have previously been raised over the locks, and in May 2010 the City Hall said that the locks could potentially cause problems for the preservation of Paris's heritage. The locks on the Pont des Arts vanished that same month, although they were later revealed to have been removed by a student at the city's École des Beaux-Arts. Police have also been known to patrol the bridge preventing couples from throwing keys into the river, while the city's official website notes the damage the locks can do - encouraging visitors to leave a digital 'e-love lock' as an alternative. The site says sections of railings have been weakened by the weight of the locks, and both grates and railings on some bridges have needed to be replaced. 'Paris claims the title of the capital of love and has hitherto shown a certain tolerance regarding padlocks,' it states. 'The City Hall keeps on top of the situation by ensuring the replacement of damaged railings. 'Nevertheless, if the tradition continues to grow in popularity and causes too much damage to the city’s monuments, solutions will be considered in a bid to address the problem without breaking the hearts of those who have sealed their undying love for each other to the Parisian bridges.' In Florence, Italy, officials took steps to remove all of the padlocks from the Ponte Vecchio to preserve the bridge, and love locks were banned on the Ponte Milvio in Rome after a lamppost on the bridge collapsed under the weight of the locks. Two years ago Dublin City Council removed padlocks from the Ha'penny Bridge over the River Liffey.","No Love Locks campaign wants padlocks banned from bridges in city .

The red box has been given a new lease of life after locals in Holwell, near Sherborne in Dorset decided it needed a makeover. Three-year-old Jessica Farrell posts a letter in Britain's oldest postbox, in Holwell, Dorset .

The weary looking postbox was stripped (right) in preparation for its respray . Chris Loder, West Dorset district councillor, asked Royal Mail to give the box some attention at the end of last year . The unusual octagonal design was commissioned in 1853 before it was made by John M Butt & Co, of Gloucester, just a year after roadside pillar boxes were first introduced. Chris Loder, West Dorset district councillor, asked Royal Mail to give the box some attention at the end of last year. He said: 'The Barnes Cross post box is an icon of the village with huge historical significance. 'It is unfortunate that Royal Mail has let the post box get into a poor state, but I was very pleased that it responded so promptly when I asked for it to be refurbished.' Roadside pillar boxes first appeared in 1852. Since then there have been hundreds of different varieties bearing the ciphers of six reigning monarchs. Up until standardisation in 1859 each area had a different designs for its postboxes. Locals including Sienna Caplen, four, can now enjoy sending their letters, admiring the newly-painted box . The postbox still bears the initials of Queen Victoria, who was on the throne when the box was first introduced in 1853 .","The red pillar box arrived in the Dorset village of Holwell in 1853 .

"By . Becky Barrow . Rise: Royal Mail is now worth £5.6billion, £2.3billion more than its initial value . Taxpayers had a raw deal from the sale of Royal Mail because it was priced too cheaply, the National Audit Office will say today. The Government’s spending watchdog said the controversial privatisation was ‘marked by deep caution, the price of which was borne by the taxpayer’. In October, the Royal Mail was floated on the stock market at a price of £3.3billion. Today it is worth £5.6billion – a gap of £2.3billion. On the first day of trading, about £750million ‘flowed to the new shareholders’ – mainly City investors who benefited from an instant 38 per cent share price rise. The NAO concludes: ‘The Department for Business could have achieved better value for the taxpayer.’ Last night Margaret Hodge MP, chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, accused the Department for Business of having ‘had no clue what it was doing’. Describing the sale as a ‘second-class performance’, she said: ‘It is clear to me the Department for Business under-sold the taxpayer when it privatised Royal Mail.’ But Business Minister Michael Fallon dismissed the criticism, saying: ‘Hindsight is a wonderful thing.’ He . added: ‘We were cautious to avoid the risk of this transaction falling . over. If we had put it on the market at a much higher price, we would . have been left with a fatally damaged Royal Mail.’ Today’s NAO report says the Government met its ‘primary objective’ of selling the postal giant before the election in May 2015. But it also lays bare the extent to . which the City hit the jackpot from the sale – and damningly concludes . the Government should cut its reliance on City advisers before any . future flotations. When the . shares went on the market, private investors were allowed to buy a . maximum of £750 worth, but an exclusive group of 16 of the City’s . biggest names were given ‘priority’ status and allowed to buy up to . £46million worth each. Criticism: Margaret Hodge MP, chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, accused Government of having 'no clue what it was doing' but Business Minister Michael Fallon said: 'Hindsight is a wonderful thing' When the Royal Mail floated . last year, Business Secretary Vince Cable said he was looking for . long-term stability from ‘the right kind of investor community’. As . a result, 16 of the City’s investment giants were singled out from the . 796 which wanted to buy shares and given favoured status. This . group was awarded a much larger tranche of shares – about £46million . worth each – while 506 received nothing and the rest between £600,000 . and £6million worth. But . few of the ‘priority’ investors – believed to include Legal & . General, Threadneedle, BlackRock, and Fidelity – have been as long-term . in their approach as Mr Cable had hoped. The NAO said: ‘Almost half of the shares allocated to them had been sold within weeks.’ In one example, Standard Life bought nearly 12million shares in October, but now owns just 118,480. Speaking to MPs in October, Business Secretary Vince Cable justified the arrangement by saying he wanted to attract ‘the right kind of investor community’, which was about ‘long-termism’. But today’s report reveals many of the ‘priority’ investors then rushed to sell their shares, making themselves a fortune as the share price rocketed from £3.30 to more than £6. Of the 16, six had sold 100 per cent of their shares ‘within the first few weeks of trading’, according to the NAO. Yesterday Mr Cable insisted: ‘Achieving the highest price possible at any cost and whatever the risk was never the aim of the sale. ‘The report concludes there was a real risk of a failed sale attached to pushing the price too high.’ Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said the Department for Business had been ‘very keen’ to sell Royal Mail in order to prevent the company becoming a burden on the taxpayer. But he added: ‘Its approach, however, was marked by deep caution, the price of which was borne by the taxpayer.’ In order to sell the business, the NAO said Royal Mail’s £8.6billion pension black hole had also been given to the taxpayer. While it has received £28.8billion of assets from the pension fund, it has also been left with £37.4billion of liabilities, which are the pension promises made to Royal Mail’s workers. Last year, it emerged that UBS, one of the banks which ran the sale on behalf of the Government, had considered increasing the price at which the shares would be offered from £3.30 to £3.50 just days before the flotation. But it then decided the move was too risky, and warned  Mr Cable against increasing the share price – advice which he followed. William Rucker, chief executive of Lazard, the investment bank which advised the Government on the sale, insisted it was the ‘maximum price achievable’ at the time. Mr Rucker said: ‘There was no clear ability to go above £3.30 at that particular time.’ Last night, Royal Mail shares were worth £5.63 each.

"By . Wills Robinson . The Middletons have developed into a family of entrepreneurs . They have set out to dominate the world of parties, baking and marshmallows. But for James his knack for business began at the tender age of 11, when he thought up a special way of picking gooseberries. Business: James Middleton (right) and Andy Bell with marshamllows from Boomf. The new venture uses Instagram images on the sweets . The Duchess of Cambridge's brother claims he 'made his cash' gathering the fruit after thinking up a technique which helped him avoid the prickles. The 26-year-old would spend the summer holidays working and said: . 'I was up at 5.30am to work as a fruit picker. I made my cash in . gooseberries — no one else wanted to do prickles, but I had a . technique.' Mr Middleton claimed he made £400 from the venture and spent it on an old car, even though he was too young to drive. And as he has grew into a businessman, he says his family's love of 'bunting' mean they are 'great' at hosting a soiree. He said: 'Celebrations are great fun. Bunting and this and that and the other.' In an interview with the Evening Standard, following the launch of his new marshmallow venture, Boomf, he also admitted his dyslexia was so severe he couldn't spell his own name. In January, it emerged Mr Middleton was the man behind a service offering to print your Instagram photographs on to the sweets, nine of which sell for £12. He launched the company with Andy Bell of Mint Digital (who used to place Instagrams on fridge magnets) and in three short months they have generated £100,000. The Duchess of Cambridge's younger brother says he had a special system for picking gooseberries when he was younger, so he didn't get 'prickled' Sweets: The Boomf edible marshmallows would come in boxes of nine and cost £12 . 'People are intrigued by them. Nobody’s ever seen this before', he said. In line with the growth of his business, he is sporting a new beard which he says has led to comments suggesting he looks like Tsar Nicholas II. For the past year, Middleton has been . in a relationship with the presenter Donna Air. 'Am I getting married? What a ridiculous question.' He then struggles to remember his girlfriend's age, questioning whether she is 33 or 34. Mr Middleton's first venture is alleged to have racked up debts of around £36,000.

"By . Damien Gayle . Thirteen retired or serving police officers have been identified as 'suspects' in the ongoing probe into the Hillsborough disaster, the police watchdog said today. Officials said 11 of them had already been quizzed under caution on suspicion of a range of offences including manslaughter, misconduct in a public office and perverting the course of justice. The other two will be interviewed very soon, said a spokesman for the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Liverpool fans are pulled to safety from the crush at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield that killed 96. Jurors have been warned an inquest into the tragic deaths could take up to a year . The spokesman said four of the 13 have been identified as suspects as part of both the IPCC's investigation and also Operation Resolve - the criminal investigation into the 1989 tragedy. The IPCC's inquiry - the biggest it has ever undertaken - covers the actions of the police in the aftermath of the crush at Hillsborough stadium, Sheffield, which left 96 Liverpool fans dead. It began after the commission reviewed the report of the Hillsborough Independent Panel, which uncovered a huge amount of new evidence about what happened during and after the tragedy. Allegations it is examining include those surrounding changes to police statements, the actions of officers after the disaster and the role of West Midlands Police, the force which investigated what happened at the time. Relatives of victims and survivors have long maintained that there was a police cover-up over the events that led to and surrounded the tragedy. Operation Resolve, under the command of assistant commissioner Jon Stoddart, retired chief constable of Durham Police, is a new, wider-ranging criminal investigation into Hillsborough. Thirteen retired or serving police officers have been identified as 'suspects' over the tragedy . A police officer gives first aid to a fan pulled from the crush. (There is no suggestion this officer is a suspect) The IPCC said it could not give any further information about the people who had been arrested and how many of them had been interviewed in relation to allegations of manslaughter. A coroner was told that the BBC has recently found an hour of unseen footage of the disaster which is now being considered by the legal teams. Pete Weatherby QC, representing 21 families, said: 'There is at least an hour of it. It is within the stadium at relevant times.' He said the BBC had previously said it had handed over everything it had but this footage had been recently found. No further details of the footage was given in court. The hearing was later adjourned after hearing legal argument around a range of issues including the 'pen portrait' statements each family will present to the inquest about their loved ones who died in 1989. Other aspects of the legal argument included the planned visit of the jury to the stadium in Sheffield and the disclosure of evidence to the various interested parties in the inquest.

"By . Ted Thornhill . Money worries: Clive Joy was once worth £69million but is now claiming to have 80,000 euros, or £65,000, left in the bank - and facing huge legal costs . An aviation tycoon and his wife embroiled in a multi-million pound divorce have been driven to fight over a £470,000 vintage Bentley, which each hopes will fund their huge legal bills. Clive Joy, 55, whose fortune was once put at £69million, is now ‘pleading poverty’ in defending a massive financial claim by the mother of his three children, Nichola Joy, a senior judge has heard. But Mrs Joy, 47, says he is claiming to be ‘penniless’ as ‘part of a dishonest strategy’ to reduce any financial award she may receive by hiding his fortune in an offshore trust. Now, they are fighting in the British courts over a 1928 4.5litre Bentley Tourer, valued at £472,000, which is parked at Chateau Tournefort, their palatial house in Provence. Martin Pointer QC, for Mr Joy, told Appeal Court judge Lord Justice Patten that the entrepreneur is caught in legal tangles on both sides of the channel – and his cash reserves have fallen to £66,000. The couple met in April 2001 and married five years later. Mrs Joy petitioned for divorce in July 2011, the court heard. A decree nisi was pronounced in June last year, but the divorce has yet to be finalised while the couple run up enormous legal bills squabbling over the partition of their assets. Zimbabwe-born Mr Joy attended university in England and has lived with his family for spells in the Caribbean and in France. He made his fortune through a phenomenally successful aircraft leasing firm. Mr Pointer said that Mr Joy moved the money made from this venture into a trust in 2002. Valuable: The couple are fighting over this model of Bentley - a 1928 Tourer (not actual car) His wife’s lawyers say he transferred . about £69million to the British Virgin Islands-based trust. But Mr . Pointer said the family’s living expenses were funded by drawing cash . from a bank loan, secured against the trust. As . of June last year, Mr Joy had withdrawn £18million in this way. Last . May, Mrs Joy got a worldwide order freezing £35million of her . ex-husband’s assets and Mr Pointer said that had ‘catastrophic . ramifications for this family’s finances’. Mr . Pointer said Mr Joy has since been unable to borrow against the trust’s . assets and it prompted the bank to order the £18million he withdrew be . repaid. When the freezing . order was lifted last November, Mr Pointer said the bank was ‘determined . not to reinstate the loan facility’ and continued to pursue payment of . the debt – leaving Mr Joy with £66,000 in cash. Clive Joy ran a successful aircraft leasing firm and is pictured here with Prince Faisal bin Al Hussein of Jordan (left) and Royal Jordanian Airlines Chief Executive Officer Samer Majali (centre), at the Paris Air Show in 2007 . Mr . Pointer said Mr Joy agreed last November that his lawyers could take a . legal charge over the Bentley as collateral for their fees. In . January, a High Court judge ordered the Bentley’s return to England so . that it could serve as security for Mrs Joy’s legal costs. But . Mr Joy is appealing against that ruling and Mr Pointer said he ‘really . is better off leaving the car where it is’ until that case is heard. He . added that the car is in any event currently subject to a French court . order, preventing its removal from the Chateau. Lord . Justice Patten ruled in favour of Mrs Joy, adding that he did not want . to make an order which makes it more difficult for the car to be freed . from the French court order.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Health minister Jane Ellison said anyone challenged to the extreme drinking game needs support to avoid giving in to peer pressure . Young people risk being bullied online if they ‘chicken out’ of a NekNomination drinking dare, the government has warned. Health minister Jane Ellison said anyone challenged to the extreme drinking game needs support to avoid giving in to peer pressure. After three deaths were linked to the internet craze which sees people dare each other to drink dangerous levels of booze, she said the government was advising against any involvement in the ‘potentially dangerous situation’. Latest figures show that in 2012 a total of 12 people in the twenties died from accidental alcohol poisoning. But the figure is expected to rise after the NekNominations craze took hold in Britain. Already this year three deaths have been linked to NekNominations. Bradley Eames, 20, apparently became the third British victim of the deadly crazy after filming himself downing nearly two pints of gin. The salesman, from Nottingham, was found dead in his home four days after filming the stunt. Police are understood to have watched the video as they investigate the tragedy. It followed the deaths of Stephen Brookes, 29, and Isaac Richardson, 20, died after completing similar NekNomination challenges. Miss Ellison said: ‘Reports of the popularity of the drinking game neknomination are a matter of concern. ‘The game's encouragement of participants to outdo each other with ever more reckless stunts brings with it significant risks of alcohol-related harm including acute intoxication, alcohol poisoning, accidents and injury.’ 400 people killed by accidental alcohol poisoning in 2012 . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . However the public health minister admitted that many young people could feel under pressure to take part once they are challenged. ‘There is the potential for cyber bullying of those who are seen to “chicken out”. ‘It has already cost lives and we would advise anyone against taking part in the game to avoid putting themselves in a potentially dangerous situation,’ she said in a written parliamentary answer. Public Health England has also issued advice through the FRANK drug information website aimed at young people. It warns: ‘Alcohol can reduce your inhibitions so you feel more confident but sometimes the situation can get out of hand. ‘Drinking sounds like fun but there is a dark side that we don't often talk about. The problem is that drinking too much alcohol on a single occasion can lead to alcohol poisoning which could put you in a coma or even kill you.’ Drink challenge: Bradley Eames, 20, is thought to have become the third British NekNominate victim. He died after downing two pints of gin. The footage was posted online . First victims: Stephen Brooks, 29, (left) who . died after downing a pint of vodka and Isaac Richardson, 20, (right) who . was the first person to die in Britain after taking part in a . NekNominate challenge . The NekNominate craze is thought to have originated in Perth, Australia, but thanks to social media it has since gone global. The hashtag 'neknominate' started trending in the UK in January 2013 and has since been growing in popularity around the world. The . concept of the game has been described by a user on Facebook as: 'Neck . your drink. Nominate another. Don't break the chain, don't be a d**k. The social drinking game for social media! #neknominate. Drink . Responsible'. The stunt is filmed then posted on the internet. One . popular video shows a bare-chested man emptying a bottle of beer down . the toilet before two friends lower him head-first into the porcelain . bowl to lap it up. Another extreme example featured a woman riding a horse into a supermarket and  downing a can of Pepsi. However, . the trend has taken a dark trend in recent weeks as reports have begun . to emerge of young men dying after drinking huge amounts of alcohol for a . dare. It added that if someone was nominated it ‘is a tricky one’. ‘You don’t want to look stupid in front of your friends but on the other you may carry out a dare that you later regret. ‘And remember what you post online can stay around for a long time and your future boss might not find it particular funny.’ Figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal that in 2012 a total of 8,367 deaths were linked to alcohol. Of these 396 were the result of accidental alcohol poisoning – the fourth highest cause of drink-related deaths. The ONS said: ‘Excessive alcohol consumption in a short period of time can have short term fatal consequences. ‘In fact, accidental alcohol poisoning (intoxication) was the fourth highest (396 deaths) alcohol-related cause of death in 2012, with over a third among those in their 40s.’ However NekNomination videos going viral online is expected to lead to an increase in 2014. The ONS added: ‘There has been speculation that the influence of social media drinking games may drive these figures up in the future particularly among younger people. ‘In 2012, there were 14 deaths among those in their 20s due to accidental alcohol poisoning, although it is not known whether these deaths were as a result of such games and any deaths occurring recently will not be included in these figures.’ Unlike other forms of alcohol-related death, which are caused by sustained consumption levels over a long period, drinking games can pose an immediate risk to life. ‘The effects of alcohol are almost immediate because it is absorbed faster than it is processed and eliminated from the body,’ the ONS said. ‘People may become very drowsy when intoxicated, they may breathe in their vomit, contract pneumonia or even die. Heavy drinking is also linked with low blood pressure, low blood sugar levels and heart attacks.’","NekNominate has gone round the world and been linked to three deaths .

Call centers received a record 2.5million calls in the week leading up to today's deadline, which is more than the 2.4million calls they received for the entire month of February. The wait time for those ringing the call center was so bad that one woman in Kansas City, Missouri came into a health services center crying because she used up all her pre-paid minutes on hold. Representatives at Swope Health Service helped that woman by letting her use the phone there. Enrollment officials at Swope also hired an extra security guard predicting more visitors, and according to the Wall Street Journal a few of the people in line did get 'belligerent' In Silver Springs, Maryland, hundreds of people queued up hours before the local health service center opened at 10am just to receive one of the 200 pink tickets to insure an appointment that day. By 10:30 all of the tickets were handed out and the rest of the people in line signed their name to receive an extension.

"By . Hugo Gye . Grieving relatives worried that their loved ones will not attract enough mourners at their funeral can now bump up the numbers by hiring 'professional sobbers'. A growing number of people are hiring out their services at £45 for a two-hour ceremony - and as well as attending the funeral they will weep and talk to friends of the deceased. The trend started in areas such as the Middle East and China, but the rise of multiculturalism has made it increasingly popular in the UK. Enterprising: A company based in Essex is hiring out professional mourners for £45 a go . Fake mourners, known as moirologists, are trained actors who specialise in the skill of appearing grief-stricken at public events. Before the funeral services, they are briefed about the life of the deceased so they can talk to other mourners as if they had genuinely known him or her. The unusual industry has become so popular that one Essex firm now has 20 staff on its books available for hire. Ian Robertson, the founder of Rent a Mourner in Braintree, admits the idea may be unfamiliar to the British, but predicts it will soon catch on. Trend: More and more British funerals are now involving professional mourners (file photo) 'We were actually inspired by the market growth in China,' he said. 'The Middle Eastern way is to provide wailers - crying women - as opposed to the quiet, dignified methods we use. 'It is growing in the UK - our bookings are up 50 per cent year on year.' 'Our staff will meet with the client beforehand and agree ""the story"", so our staff will either have known the deceased professionally or socially. They will be informed of the deceased's background, achievements, failures etc., so they can converse with other mourners with confidence.' The company says on its website: 'We are typically invited to help increase visitors to funerals where there may be a low turnout expected.

'It's still a niche market at the moment but demand for professional mourners is increasing year on year as more people from East Asian and Middle Eastern countries move to the UK, bringing their customs with them. 'The rise in popularity shows a cultural shift taking place in how we choose to pay our last respects and like with many other cultural imports, it's only a matter of time before it crosses over into mainstream culture.'

"By . Associated Press . It was revealed today that the piece needed to fix a defective ignition switch linked to 13 traffic deaths would have cost just 57 cents, according to documents submitted by General Motors to lawmakers investigating why the company took 10 years to recall cars with the flaw. CEO Mary Barra has testified in a congressional hearing today saying that she was disturbed by past GM comments that the cost of replacing defective switches in some cars was too high. 'I am deeply sorry,' Barra said at the beginning of the hearing. At a hearing Tuesday, members of a House subcommittee demanded answers from Barra about why the automaker used the switch in small cars such as the Chevrolet Cobalt and Saturn Ion even though it knew the part didn't meet GM's own specifications. Her job to defend: The newly-appointed CEO of GM, Mary Barra, was questioned about the decision to wait a decade before recalling millions of cars with a faulty part that were involved in up to 13 deaths . Looking for answers: Barra said that the company has ordered a wide-ranging investigation and she will know the answers to many of the committee's questions once that is completed . Colorado Representative Diana DeGette held up a switch for one of the cars and said a small spring inside it failed to provide enough force, causing car engines to turn off when they went over a bump. DeGette showed how easy it was for a light set of keys to move the ignition out of the ‘run’ position. That can cause the engine to stall and the driver to lose power steering and power brakes. ‘Documents provided by GM show that this unacceptable cost increase was only 57 cents,’ DeGette said. In her prepared statement, Barra said she doesn't know ‘why it took years for a safety defect to be announced,’ but ‘we will find out.’ Since February, GM has recalled 2.6 million cars over the faulty switch. The automaker said new switches should be available starting April 7. 'Too costly': Congresswoman Diana DeGette holds up an ignition switch that reportedly cost 57 cents per piece but GM heads previously said that a recall would be too expensive . Owners can ask dealers for a loaner car while waiting for the replacement part. Barra said GM has provided more than 13,000 loaner vehicles. GM has said that in 2005 company engineers proposed solutions to the switch problem but that the automaker concluded that none represented ‘an acceptable business case.’ In an exchange with Pennsylvania Representative Tim Murphy, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Barra acknowledged that the switch didn't meet the company's own specifications. Murphy also read from an e-mail exchange between GM employees and those at Delphi, which made the switch. One said that the Cobalt is ‘blowing up in their face in regards to the car turning off.’ Woman in charge: Barra, seen on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, has worked at GM since 1980, rising through the ranks before being appointed the company's first female CEO in December . Under oath: She announced that the company had retained the lawyer who helped lead the dispersement of claims for Boston Marathon and September 11 victims, to help address how GM should compensate the families of their victims . Murphy asked why, if the problem was so big, GM didn't replace all of them in cars already on the road. ‘Clearly there were a lot of things happening’ at that time, Barra said. Barra repeatedly said the answer to lawmakers' questions would be part of GM's internal investigation. She announced that the company had retained Kenneth Feinberg, the lawyer who helped lead the dispersement of claims for Boston Marathon and September 11 victims, to help address how GM should compensate the families of their victims. In his prepared remarks, David Friedman, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, pointed the finger at GM, saying the automaker had information last decade that could have led to a recall, but shared it only last month. Republican Congressman Fred Upton of Michigan, who serves as the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said GM and government regulators got complaints about the switches 10 years ago, and GM submitted reports to the agency. Heartbreaking: Congressmen who were doing the questioning throughout Tuesday's hearing repeatedly drew attention to the families of the victims who brought photos of their loved ones into the chambers . Victims: The safety defects related to  a faulty ignition switch has been linked to 13 deaths and dozen of crashes . Putting a name on the cause: The victims relatives decided to come as a collected force, calling themselves 'GM Recall Survivors' Committee member Representative Henry Waxman said that committee staff members found 133 warranty claims filed with GM over 10 years detailing customer complaints of sudden engine stalling when they drove over a bump or brushed keys with their knees. The claims were filed between June 2003 and June 2012. Waxman said that because GM didn't undertake a simple fix when it learned of the problem, ‘at least a dozen people have died in defective GM vehicles.’ Some current GM car owners and relatives of those who died in crashes were also in Washington seeking answers. The group attended the hearing after holding a news conference demanding action against GM and stiffer legislation. 2001: A report on the Saturn Ion, which was still in development, notes problems with the ignition switch, but says a design change solved the problems. February 2002: GM approves the ignition switch design, even though it was told by Delphi — the supplier — that initial tests showed the switch didn't meet GM's specifications. 2003: A service technician reports that a Saturn Ion stalled while driving, and that the weight of the owners' keys had worn down the ignition switch. Late 2004: The Saturn Ion's cousin, the 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt, goes on sale. GM learns of at least one crash where a Cobalt engine lost power after the driver inadvertently moved the key or steering column. GM engineers replicate the problem in test drives. An inquiry is opened within the company, but closes after potential solutions are rejected. February 2005: GM engineers meet to consider making changes to the ignition switch after stalling reports. But an engineer says the switch is ""very fragile"" and advises against changes. March 2005: The engineering manager of the Cobalt closes an investigation, saying an ignition switch fix would take too long and cost too much, and that ""none of the solutions represents an acceptable business case."" May 2005: A GM engineer proposes changing the design of the key so it won't tug the ignition switch downward. The solution is initially approved but later cancelled. July 29, 2005: Amber Marie Rose, 16, dies in a frontal crash in her 2005 Cobalt. A contractors hired by NHTSA found that the Cobalt's ignition had moved out of the ""run"" position and into the ""accessory"" position, which cut off power to power steering the air bags. September 2005: GM's legal staff opens a file on the Maryland crash. December 2005: GM tells dealers to inform owners of Cobalts to take excess items off their key chains so the key isn't pulled downward. Also, inserts placed on customers' keys can prevent the keys from shifting while in the ignition. The bulletin includes the 2005-2006 Chevrolet Cobalt, 2003-2006 Saturn Ion, 2006 Chevrolet HHR, 2006 Pontiac Solstice and the 2005-2006 Pontiac Pursuit, which was sold in Canada. Warranty records show that only 474 owners got those key inserts. April 2006: A GM engineer signs off on a redesign of the ignition switch. The new switch goes into cars from the 2007 model year and later. October 2006: GM updates the dealer bulletin to add vehicles from the 2007 model year. March 2007: A group of GM employees learn from NHTSA staff of the 2005 fatal crash. By the end of the year, GM has data on nine crashes — in four, the ignition had moved from the run position to the accessory position. August 2007: NHTSA contracts with Indiana University to study a 2006 Wisconsin crash in which two passengers died. The report finds the ignition in the 2005 Cobalt was in the accessory position and the air bags didn't deploy. September 2007: Chief of NHTSA's Defects Assessment Division proposes an investigation of air bags failing to deploy in the Cobalt and Ion. Two months later, a NHTSA panel decides not to open a formal investigation, saying that the air bags aren't failing at a higher rate than peer vehicles. 2009: GM decides to change the key's head from a ""slot"" design to a ""hole"" design to reduce downward force. The key is changed for the 2010 model year — the last year the Cobalt is sold. 2010: After a NHTSA investigation, GM agrees to repair power steering motors in a little more than 1 million 2005-2010 Chevrolet Cobalts and 2007-2010 Pontiac G5s. 2011: GM launches a new investigation into 2005-2007 Cobalts and the 2007 Pontiac G5 to determine why their air bags didn't deploy in crashes. 2012: GM widens the investigation, but it closes without reaching a conclusion.December 2013: Incoming CEO Mary Barra learns about the ignition switch defect. January 2014: A committee of GM executives approves a recall. February 13: GM recalls 780,000 compact cars, including Chevrolet Cobalts, Pontiac G5s and Pontiac Pursuits from the 2005-2007 model years. February 25: GM expands the recall to include Saturn Ions and three other vehicles. The recall now totals 1.6 million vehicles worldwide. March 5: NHTSA demands that GM turn over by April 3 documents showing when it found out about the ignition switch problem. Barra promises employees an ""unvarnished"" investigation into what happened. March 10: A House subcommittee says it will hold a hearing, eventually set for April 1, on the GM recalls. The Justice Department is also conducting a criminal probe. March 17: GM announces three new recalls of 1.5 million vehicles, as part of an effort to assure buyers that it's moving faster to fix safety defects. March 18: Barra apologizes for the deaths that occurred. She appoints a new global safety chief. March 28: GM expands the small car recall to include 971,000 vehicles from the 2008-2011 model years, which may have gotten the defective switches as replacement parts. March 31: GM recalls 1.5 million vehicles, including the 2010 Cobalt and the 2004-2007 Ion, because the electronic power-steering assist can suddenly stop working. April 1-2: Barra, NHTSA acting chief David Friedman to testify before Congressional committees. April 7: GM expects replacement switches to be available at dealerships. The company says the repairs could take until October.","Mary Barra told Congress today that she was disturbed by earlier statements from other GM execs who said it would be too costly to switch the faulty parts .

"By . Jennifer Smith . Tim Meek with daughters Amy (front), Ella (back), and wife Kerry. The family completed 100 outdoor activities in one year to avoid becoming too lazy . No one wants to put a draconian ban on their little ones watching the telly. But if you drag them off into enough forests and caves and along enough rivers it seems you get the same result. Tim . and Kerry Meek know, because that’s exactly what they did to their two . daughters after becoming concerned they might lose their childhood to . CBeebies. Rather than allow . the girls time to settle in front of the box, the couple set Amy, ten, . and Ella, eight, 100 outdoor challenges to complete. A . year on, they have just ticked off the last of them – sleeping in a . ‘tentsile’, a sort of cross between a hammock and a tent which is . suspended between two trees. The youngsters so enjoyed themselves they are now helping to draw up a fresh list of challenges for the next 12 months. Interestingly, they now only watch about three hours of television a week. Over . the past year the two sisters have been involved in activities as wide . ranging as making a rope swing, preparing and drinking nettle soup and . watching a meteor shower from a beach-side bivvy. Others . involved caving, kayaking and hiking – all come rain, shine or snow. Some of the challenges – which the Meeks estimate cost only £500 to . complete – were undertaken on days out from the family’s home in Arnold, . Nottinghamshire, at weekends; others during trips to Northumberland, . Scotland, Pembrokeshire, and the South West of England. Scroll down for video . Canoeing down a river was just one of the 100 outdoor activities undertaken by the girls and their parents who are both school teachers . The family taking part in a kayak safari. Mr and Mrs Meek didn't want their daughters to spend all their free time watching TV and playing video games . Snorkelling was one of many water activities the family undertook in coastal parts of the country such as Cornwall . Ella, whose favourite task was . ‘coasteering’, where rocky coastlines are traversed on foot and by . swimming, in Cornwall, said: ‘Our friends spend a lot of their free time . watching telly or playing on computer games in their bedrooms, luckily . we’ve had the chance to do something different.’ Mr . Meek, 44, a teacher at a special needs school, said: ‘We’re just . normal, everyday people and not adventurous ourselves, but as we saw our . kids growing up, we became more reflective as parents and wanted them . to grow up with balance in their lives. ‘I . think kids these days spend more time indoors than we did. They may do a . lot of activities, but they don’t necessarily have freedom to express . themselves or explore freely. ‘They are protected from risks which makes them very safe, but it makes them unable to take or to manage risks themselves. So as to avoid wrapping their daughters up in . cotton wool the parents encouraged them to take part in a variety of . activities they wouldn't normally do . Ella and Amy pictured while damming a river. The family only left the UK once as part of their adventures when they visisted the Eiffel Tower while on a holiday to France . Coasteering was eight-year-old Ella's favourite . activity, while the girls' mother Kerry enjoyed bivvy-bagging under the . stars on a beach . 'Of course, we always want Ella and Amy . to do things safely, but in most of the challenges there’s an element of . something could happen, they could graze themselves or trap a finger, . say. 'Now, if they fall over they tend to shrug it off. Our girls have taken on a role as ambassadors for adventure.’ The . girls’ social skills were also tested as one of the challenges was to . stand up in front of their school to give a talk, and support a charity. Both sisters were in the . Brownies when they were younger, but found it ‘a bit arts and crafty and . wanted something more rough and tumble’. The family have been invited to speak at a number of outdoor festivals and activities to encourage other families to do similar activities, such as a wild river swim . Climb a winter summit and skiing were among the tasks which the family took in their stride in all weather conditions . All of the 100 adventures cost the family less than £500 put together, including walking to tidal islands (pictured) and kayak safaris . Foraging for food and cooking for Kerry Meek on mother's day using just one pot were other challenges . The family is now planning a list of activities to take on next year, with the hope that other families will be inspired to do the same . Ella is now in the Cubs and Amy in the Scouts. Mrs Taylor, 39, a . primary school teacher, said: ‘It’s just about giving things a go and . trying things out.’ ‘My favourite activity was bivvy bagging . [where a waterproof cover is put over a sleeping bag so you can sleep . outdoors without a tent] as we got to sleep under the stars and saw a . meteor shower on a beach on the Norfolk coast. ‘I didn’t like the . idea at all at first but it was incredible.

"By . Tara Brady . Police were left baffled today after discovering a badly decomposed body in woodlands at a golf course. The mystery began when a woman dialled 999 to say her dog had emerged from trees at Meyrick Park, in Bournemouth, Dorset, with a human arm in its mouth. The discovery sparked a massive police search but while officers were at the scene a man approached them with two human leg bones in a plastic bag. The walker took police to the spot in . the woods where he found them but when they looked up they found more . human remains, believed to be a head, hanging from a tree. Grizzly: A man points police in the direction of where he found the human bones in Bournemouth . A large part of exclusive Meyrick Park, Bournemouth, was sealed as forensic officers using specialist tracker dogs, searched for any more human remains. However, their hunt was halted when a man aged in his 40s approached them clutching two more human bones in a clear plastic bag. He told them he had found them previously, in the same woods - and handed them over to police officers who put them in evidence bags. The man, who lives near the golf course but declined to give his name, said he had found the bones in the woods and had taken them home. However, he was now not sure he had done the right thing so did not want to comment further. The walker took police to the spot in the woods where he found them but when they looked up they found more human remains . A spokesman for Dorset Police said last night that officers had found 'additional human remains' in an inaccessible place, high up in a tree. 'They have been found high up in a tree. The remains have not yet been identified,' the spokesman added. It was believed all the bones relate to a person who hanged themselves in the top of the tree, possibly months ago. As the body decomposed, the bones fell to the ground. Discovery: A spokesman for Dorset Police said last night that officers had found 'additional human remains' Teams of police forensic experts with tracker dogs were today working in a large sealed off section of Meyrick Park golf course in Bournemouth, Dorset. A private ambulance was called to the scene to take the hand away to be examined at a hospital mortuary. The golf club remained open to players who were stopped from using just one hole by blue and white police tape. A spokesman for Dorset Police said a pathologist had confirmed the hand to be human, prompting a thorough search of the woodland with police sniffer dogs. 'It is being treated as unexplained and no arrests have been made,' said the spokesman. The golf club remained open to players who were stopped from using just one hole by blue and white police tape . She added that officers did not yet know whether it was an arm belonging to a man or a woman or how long it had been in the woodland. It was described as being in 'fairly advanced' stage of decomposition. The limb, which had been detached from just below the elbow, did not have any remnants of clothing or other type of covering on it, and had no distinguishing features. There were no rings on the fingers. Files on missing people were also being examined for clues about who the arm belonged to. The horrifying discovery was made yesterday afternoon. Police were left baffled today after discovering a badly decomposed body in woodlands at a golf course . 'At 1.06pm officers received a report that human remains had been found on the Bournemouth and Meyrick Park Golf Club,' said the police spokesman. 'Further analysis of the object has confirmed that the item is decomposed human tissue.' Residents living near to the golf course regularly walk their dogs on the land surrounding the holes and were stopped by the investigation. One walker, who did not want to be named, said: 'Everyone who walks up here has said it’s an arm or a hand. It’s not very nice, it’s sad to think it’s been in that woodland without anyone knowing.'","Police were called to Meyrick Park, in Bournemouth, at 1pm today .

"By . Laura Cox . The BBC has admitted programmes aired before the 9pm watershed are not always suitable for children. Under the corporation’s guidelines, programmes containing adult material such as nudity, swearing and violence should not be shown before this boundary. But the corporation’s governing body has now confessed, for what appears to be the first time, that not all programming shown an hour before the watershed is suitable for younger children - prompting experts to warn that this could signal the end of the 9pm threshold. Claim: Viewers of the popular soap Holby City, on at 8pm, 'would not have found the swearing unacceptable' The unexpected and damning admission was made by the BBC Trust following criticism from a viewer about sexually explicit swearing during the long-running and popular soap Holby City which is aired at 8pm. Rejecting the complaint that it was inappropriate for such language to be used before the watershed, the trust’s Editorial Standards Committee said in a report released yesterday that ‘regular viewers of this drama serial would not have found the use of the word ‘s***ging’ or the phrase ‘cut his b**** off’ unacceptable.’ It added: ‘Holby City starts an hour before the watershed, when viewers are aware that not all programming is suitable for younger children. ‘Parents and carers share responsibility with the broadcaster to decide what is suitable for children to view.’ The decision was made despite the BBC’s own editorial guidelines stating that programmes shown between 5.30am and 9pm must be suitable for children. Responding to the decision, Vivienne Pattison, of campaign group Media Watch, described the revelation as ‘shocking’ and ‘incredible’, while Miranda Suit, co-chair of charity Safermedia, warned that continual breaches of the watershed in this way would lead to a ‘public outcry’. Report: The unexpected and damning admission was made by the BBC Trust following criticism from a viewer about sexually explicit swearing during the long-running and popular soap Holby City which is aired at 8pm . Miss Pattison, 44, said the BBC Trust’s decision not to uphold the complaint meant parents could no longer trust that their children are safe from explicit material. The mother-of-two said: '’I’m really shocked that they have done this. According to their own broadcasting code the 9pm watershed signals the beginning of the transition towards more adult material so by this reckoning, what is it? 'I’m really shocked that they have done this. According to their own broadcasting code the 9pm watershed signals the beginning of the transition towards more adult material so by this reckoning, what is it?' Vivienne Pattison, Media Watch . 'Eight o’clock? Half past seven? Is that the beginning of the transition?’ Holby City, a BAFTA award-winning medical drama, is broadcast weekly on BBC 1 at 8pm. Offence was caused to a viewer during an episode aired in September last year which was watched by 4.66 million people, including about 186,000 children. During the programme a registrar says to a nurse: ‘You’re just s***ging her [referring to a consultant]. Actually forming a functioning relationship with a woman is like picking through a minefield.’ Later in the episode the consultant advises the registrar to ‘remind him that you have the power to cut his b**** off’ after a radiologist delays a patient’s X-Ray. The complainant, who has not been named, took offence to ‘such appallingly sexually explicit language’ and he contacted the BBC querying whether the language used in the programme would have been acceptable if it had been used by a schoolteacher. He stated: ‘I contend that parents and carers do not have dual standards and they expect high standards from their schools and their BBC.’ Appropriate viewing? The decision was made despite the BBC's own editorial guidelines stating that programmes shown between 5.30am and 9pm must be suitable for children (file picture) The Trust admitted there was ‘some sensitivity’ to the use of the word ‘s**g’ in pre-watershed viewing and referred to previous complaints from viewers. It also noted that some viewers may find the use of these particular words ‘offensive’ but said the language was fitting given the context of the scene and the ‘animosity’ between the two characters on the show. However, the Trust, which acts as the final arbiter of appeals within the corporation, concluded the programme had not breached guidelines. 'There are so many tens of thousands of parents who actually consider that the watershed is really helping them protect their children' Miranda Suit, Safermedia . Miss Pattison argued parents used the watershed as a guide to know what is and is not suitable for their children to watch. She said: ‘I’ve never seen Holby City but does that mean I cannot expect that my first time of watching it to be suitable for pre-watershed broadcast? It must be because it’s broadcast before nine o’clock.’ Mrs Suit, 59, whose charity is working to protect children from media harm, added: ‘There are so many tens of thousands of parents who actually consider that the watershed is really helping them protect their children. 'But if we’re going to see broadcasters themselves undermining that protection then I think we’ll have a real outcry.’ The complaint is not the first time that questions have been raised over the BBC and swearing. In 2009 viewers told a TV standards investigation that they were fed up with bad language. Under the new regime suggested, ironically, by the BBC Trust, the most offensive words will almost always be bleeped out or cut for another hour after the 9pm watershed on BBC 1.","Admission made by BBC Trust after criticism over 8pm show Holby City .

Jurors trying two defendants accused of murdering Antoin Akpom were told the victims of the blaze had no connection with him or his alleged killers. Abdul Hakim and Hussain Hussain deny murdering Mr Akpom, who was stabbed in Leicester around seven hours before the alleged arson attack which killed Shehnila Taufiq, her daughter Zainab, 19, and sons Bilal, 17, and Jamil, 15. Victim: Antoin Akpom, who was found stabbed in a Leicester street in September. A house just yards from the family home of one of his alleged killers burned down in the hours after the attack, killing four . Loss: The alleged arson attack killed Shehnila Taufiq, her daughter Zainab, 19, and sons Bilal, 17, and Jamil, 15 . A court sketch from Birmingham Crown Court showing Hussain Hussain, 19, (left) and Abdul Hakim ,19, (right). The two men have pleaded not guilty to murdering 20 year old football coach Antoin Akpom . Opening the Crown’s case against the two men, prosecutor Richard Latham QC said the Taufiqs’ home in Wood Hill, Leicester, was two doors away from an address occupied by Mr Hakim’s mother. Mr Akpom, 20, died in hospital after suffering a collapsed lung in Kent Street, Leicester, at about 5.30pm on September 12 last year. Aftermath:  The scene of the fatal blaze on Wood Hill, Leicester, which claimed the lives of four people . Explaining the background to the deaths to a jury at Stafford Crown Court, Mr Latham said: 'Mr Akpom was pronounced dead just before 7 o’clock that evening. 'At half past midnight that night - five-and-a-half hours after Akpom had died - there was an arson attack outside the front door of a family who lived in Leicester - but two doors away from Hakim’s mother’s home. 'The fire caused the deaths of the four occupants of the home.' Urging the jury not to speculate about evidence due to be heard at a separate trial connected to the fire, Mr Latham added: 'The tragedy was that the occupants had nothing to do with the incident in Kent Street, nothing to do with Akpom. 'Whoever did this - if it had anything to do with the stabbing - got the wrong house. 'Those alleged to be responsible for that fire will be tried by another jury in another Crown Court in a few weeks’ time. It has no bearing on what happened in Kent Street on the evening of September 12.' Mr Akpom was stabbed around half an hour after leaving a Leicester primary school where he helped to run a dance class. The father-of-one is alleged to have been attacked near a gym after a confrontation with Mr Hakim and Mr Hussain, who are both 19. It was apparent from the evidence in the case, Mr Latham said, that there was 'some sort of bad feeling' between Mr Akpom and Mr Hakim, which seemed to have been going on for about a year. During the Crown’s opening of the case, jurors were asked to view still images from CCTV cameras, including some showing Mr Akpom with his back to the camera after he had been stabbed. Mr Akpom was described by his friend Joe French as 'an all-round great guy and a great role model' Mr Akpom was stabbed around half an hour after leaving a Leicester primary school where he helped to run a dance class . Further images recorded on a passing bus showed Hussain and Hakim, of Wood Hill, Leicester, running from Kent Street towards Humberstone Road after the alleged murder. Mr Latham said it was accepted by the defence that both defendants were involved in the incident, but what they had done at the scene was in dispute. CCTV footage recovered from premises in the Kent Street area showed Mr Akpom getting out of the passenger seat of a Fiat Punto to confront his alleged killers. The Crown alleges Mr Hussain, of no fixed address, inflicted the fatal stab wound after punches were thrown by all three men during an altercation in the street. Outlining the evidence against the defendants, Mr Latham said CCTV images showed the moments immediately before and after the stabbing. Police teams carry out searches on Kent Street in Leicester, where Antoin Akpom was stabbed and later died in hospital . Outlining the evidence against the defendants, prosecutor Richard Latham said CCTV images showed the moments immediately before and after the stabbing . It is alleged that there was 'some sort of bad feeling' between Mr Akpom and Mr Hakim . Mr Latham told jurors that CCTV cameras had also captured the car Mr Akpom was travelling in as it approached the defendants, who were on foot in Kent Street. Describing the extent of the CCTV footage to the jury, Mr Latham added: 'Frustratingly, although there are several cameras, the precise place where the stabbing happened is not covered by a camera. 'Immediately before and seconds after (the stabbing) you will have images, but from the critical period where the stabbing occurred, there is no image.' Witness Joe French told the court he had been close friends with Mr Akpom since they were 12-years-old. He . described his friend, who he ran a coaching business with, as 'an . all-round great guy' who was 'a great friend and a great role model'. Mr French told the court he saw Mr Akpom running towards him moments after being stabbed. Mr French told the court he saw Mr Akpom running towards him moments after being stabbed. He said: 'He put his arm around me and I put my arm on his back and there was a lot of blood. I realised he had been stabbed' Giving . evidence, he said: 'He put his arm around me and I put my arm on his . back and there was a lot of blood. I realised he had been stabbed. 'I took my jacket off, took my top off and I held the blood in with my top and laid him down on the floor. 'I . was informed an ambulance had already been rang so I rang Amber, his . girlfriend, and told her Antoin had been hurt and to get to the gym. 'I threw my car keys to somebody and said ‘go and bring my car’ because I didn’t want to leave Antoin on the floor. 'I was going to take him to the hospital. As soon as the car was near, police had blocked the road off.' The court heard Mr Hakim and Mr Hussain travelled to London after the stabbing and arrived at an address in Enfield just before midnight on September 12. The pair then ordered two taxis using the name ‘Jonathan’ at lunchtime the next day and separated. A smashed window and charred debris from the fire. The house is less than a mile away from where Mr Akpom was stabbed . But Mr Hakim - who told the driver to take him to King’s Cross station - was arrested by a British Transport Police officer outside the drop off point for St Pancras railway station at 5.25pm on September 13. The court heard Mr Hussain asked to be taken to his mother’s address in London. He then went inside the house and returned to the taxi with a large brown envelope - which the driver said contained a large quality of cash believed to be between £3,000 and £4,000. The court heard he told the taxi driver he was wanted by police and said he was going abroad for a couple of months. Mr Hussain was taken to Stanstead Airport in the taxi and made his way to the EasyJet travel desk before asking for a flight to Amsterdam. But the jury were told he didn’t have a passport or travel visa on him so was told the only place he could travel to was Scotland. He dismissed that idea and stayed at a hotel in Ilford before paying £200 in cash to get a taxi to Cardiff in South Wales the next day. The court heard he was arrested by a police officer 16 days later in Cardiff on September 29. Both men gave no comment answers in police interviews but blamed each other for the stabbing in pre-prepared statements. The trial continues.

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . The Department of Defense is giving serious consideration to a move that would ban smoking on all military bases, and on naval ships around the world. 'I think we owe it to our people to review the military's tobacco sales policy,' Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told surprised reporters during a Monday briefing. The decision would stand in sharp contrast to iconic images of World War II doughboys and sailors at sea with cigarettes in their mouths, and Marines smoking celebratory cigars after successful missions. Sergeant First Class Carl Ingram (L) and Staff Sergeant Kirk Kirkendall (R) enjoyed these cigars sat a bar on the Camp Blackjack US Army based near Baghdad nearly 10 years ago, but the practice may go the way of the dodo . Thinking about it: Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel will consider a broad effort to ban the sale of tobacco on military bases and naval vessels . Smoking has been a permitted pleasure, albeit an unhealthy one, for servicemen and women for as long as there has been a U.S. military, but that's set to change as Senate Democrats make a political move . Five U.S. senators, all Democrats, are urging Navy Secretary Ray Mabus to take the idea seriously and make naval stations and ships the first step in a larger military-wide change. But at least one member of Congress, a Marine Corps veteran, is pushing back, calling it a 'personal decision' of fighting men and women. 'We urge you to do everything in your capacity to address this issue for our military men and women,' the five lawmakers wrote to Mabus on Monday, 'including moving forward with the proposal to stop the sale of tobacco aboard all naval bases and ships.' The letter was signed by Sens. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Tom Harkin of Iowa and Jack Reed of Rhode Island. Citing a 2009 Defense Department report that estimated a $1.9 billion smoking-related cost in health expenses and lost productivity, they said the initiative would 'renew emphasis on the health of our dedicated sailors and Marines as well as provide for increased combat readiness.' Rep. Duncan Hunter, a California Republican who joined the U.S. Marine Corps after the 9/11 terror attacks and served tours in Iraq in Afghanistan, objected. 'Overall, removing tobacco sales is perceived more as a political decision, intended to make a point, than it is a decision that supports our sailors and Marines – regardless of personal feelings on the individual and legal use of tobacco products,' he wrote to Mabus. In its quest to maximize military readiness, Hunter said in his letter, 'the Navy should wo . Smoking breaks are common on Army bases, but some want the practice killed off because it sends the message that smoking is acceptable . Times change: In 1950, US troops in South Korea were often pictured with American-made cigarettes hanging from their mouths . rry less about intruding on the personal decision-making of these same sailors and Marines.' Smoking rates have declined among active duty military personnel in recent years, due in part to an existing safety-related tobacco ban on submarines, and the Pentagon's provision of smoking-cessation services for soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines who want to kick the habit. But in 2011, social scientists at the University of California San Francisco found that more than 30 percent of U.S. troops are smokers, compared to 20 percent of American civilians. Naval bases ended a program in 2012 that offered cigarette discounts to on-base personnel. Navy base commissaries also no longer sell tobacco. But the Post Exchanges run by the military – the famed 'Px's – derive 4.5 per cent of all their  sales from tobacco. In the Army and Air Force, that figure is 6 per cent. Overall, the Pentagon reaps a $100 million windfall every year from tobacco profits, money that funds recreation programs on military bases and family support programs. A March 14 Pentagon called for '[s]tructural reforms in how and where we allow tobacco purchases to be made, as well as the need to consider tobacco-free installations,' saying they were 'matters that require our near-term attention. The memo came from Acting Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Jessica Wright, and Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Dr. Jonathan Woodson. 'The prominence of tobacco products in retail outlets and permission for smoking breaks while on duty sustain the perception that we are not serious about reducing the use of tobacco,' they wrote. Any decision about forbidding tobacco sales on military bases and ships would have to be made at the highest levels of the Pentagon. Technically possible, but difficult: Soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines could still smoke, but they'll have to find another ay to buy cigarettes and cigars . Nudge: Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, is leading a group of five liberal senators who want the Navy to ban sales of smokes as a first step toward a tobacco-free military . Smoke-free workplace? The USS Carl Vinson, wshown leaving San Diego in 2013, would be among hundreds of naval ships where no one could buy cigarettes . Mabus told the paper last week that 'we demand that sailors and Marines be incredibly fit. We know tobacco hurts that fitness. We know the cost of health care far exceeds any profits we could possibly make selling that.' He wrote in a 2012 memo that '[t]obacco use is the most avoidable public health hazard in the Navy and Marine Corps.' That followed a 2009 Pentagon statement, issued early in the Obama administration, saying for the first time that it 'supports a smoke-free military and believes it is achievable.' Representatives of Philip Morris International, a major cigarette producer, and a spokesman for the Cigar Rights of America lobby group, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","Liberal senators want Pentagon 'to stop the sale of tobacco aboard all naval bases and ships'

"By . Chris Pleasance . Lynette Williams, 54, has blasted police for not properly investigating her daughter's killer in 2008 when he tried to strangle another girl . The mother of murdered Georgia Williams has slammed the police watchdog’s decision not to probe why her attacker was let off for trying to strangle another teenage girl five years before killing her daughter. In 2008 Jamie Reynolds was reported to police when he tried to strangle a girl after luring her back to his house on the pretext of a photo shoot, but was let off with a caution. Now Lynette Williams, 52, says her daughter could still be alive if officers had properly investigated that crime. Reynolds, 23, became the 50th person in the UK to be sentenced to life in prison after killing Georgia in Wellington, Shrops., on May 26 last year. Mrs Williams said: 'In 2008, Reynolds basically mirrored an attack that he committed on Georgia, in that he lured a girl round on the pretext of helping him out with a project and then there was a violent attack where he attempted to strangle her. 'Thankfully she managed to escape, but it has traumatised her and it has totally changed her life. 'As parents, we feel that had it been investigated properly, we wouldn’t be in this situation. 'Obviously the young girl that was attacked has put in a complaint as she feels she wasn’t dealt with properly at that time and ever since - she was interviewed initially, then that was it she had no other contact with the police. Reynolds, 23 (left), was cautioned by police in 2008 after trying to strangle a girl he had lured to his house on the pretext of a photo shoot. In December last year, he used a similar method to kill Georgia Williams, 17 (right) Reynolds was jailed for life in December last year after the judge heard he had the potential to go on and become a serial killer. He is only the 50th person in UK history to be given such a sentence . 'I did get very angry with the police because I felt that if they had dealt with it properly in 2008 everyone would have known about his past, they would have known what he was like with girls. 'Obviously, I wouldn’t have let Georgia anywhere near him.' Mrs Williams added that Reynolds’ stepfather had gone to the police with disturbing photographs he found on the boy's computer, but the police never acted on it. The photos were of two girls with nooses superimposed around their necks and a image depicting pornographic scenes of a man raping, strangling and killing a girl, she said. She said that photos of Georgia’s older sister, Scarlett, were also found on his hard drives. She added: 'I want the police to change how they view these attacks, I want police officers investigated properly, which is why I want the IPCC to do it, not another force.' West Mercia Police said it had referred its handling of previous incidents involving Reynolds to the IPCC in January. A spokesman said: 'On Friday 14 March the IPCC informed us that their recommendation was that such an investigation should be managed locally by West Mercia Police. 'We take the concerns around these previous incidents very seriously and following the outcome of our referral to the IPCC we are reviewing their recommendation and how this investigation will progress.' Today the police watchdog, the IPCC, has said it will not investigate Reynolds' earlier offence, and has instead referred it back to West Merica police for an internal investigation (pictured, Georgia with Reynolds) IPCC Commissioner Derrick Campbell said: 'I have had the opportunity to look at the request made to us concerning the conduct of the police in relation to this case. 'After careful consideration, I have decided that the public interest is best served by West Mercia Police demonstrating that they are capable of conducting an open, fair and transparent investigation into this matter. 'If there are any findings of misconduct following their investigation, then one would expect suitable action to be taken. 'Following a local investigation the complainants will, if dissatisfied with the investigation, have a right of appeal to the IPCC and if necessary the IPCC will be able to direct further investigation.' A separate independent review is also being conducted into various agencies’ involvement with Reynolds before the murder. Georgia’s body was found in woodland off the Nant-y-Garth Pass in north Wales days after she went missing from her home in Wellington, Shrops., on May 26. Reynolds lured Georgia to his house for a photo shoot, persuaded her to climb on a box and put her head in a noose for a picture, then kicked the box away, hanging her . School friend Reynolds was subsequently jailed for life for her brutal murder in December last year after Birmingham Crown Court heard he had the potential to go on to be a serial killer. The twisted shop worker lured the 17-year-old to his home where he hanged her from a noose before performing sexual acts on her dead body. He even set up a homemade gallows made from an upturned red recycling box beneath a rope which was attached to the loft hatch. After taking a series of innocent pictures of the teenager, Reynolds persuaded her to stand on the box with the rope around her neck. He then bound Georgia’s hands together before kicking the box away causing the pretty teenage RAF cadet to asphyxiate. After she died, Reynolds - who hoarded hardcore ‘snuff’ movies featuring sexual killings - stripped Georgia and abused her lifeless body. At the time Mr Williams, 55, spoke about how he and his wife were receiving counselling to help them cope with Georgia’s death. After hanging her, Reynolds took pictures of Georgia's body before carrying out a sexual assault . 2008: Jamie Reynolds, then 17, is reported to police after luring a girl back to his house with an offer of a photo shoot before trying to strangle her. He is let off with a caution. Later, Reynolds' stepfather goes to the police with pictures from the boy's hard drive. They feature girls with nooses superimposed around their necks and pornographic images of a man raping and strangling a girl to death. No action is taken. Sunday May 26 2013: Georgia is last seen by her parents at 7.30pm as she leaves the family home in Wellington, Shropshire. She tells them she is going to stay with friends. In fact she went to Reynolds' home where he persuaded her to climb onto a box and place her head in a noose for a picture, before kicking the box away and hanging her. He then took several pictures of her dead body, both clothed and unclothed, before carrying out a sexual assault. Tuesday May 28: Georgia is reported missing by her parents after it emerges she has not stayed with friends. Police arrive in the morning to a semi-detached house in Avondale Road, Wellington, and, according to a neighbour, break down the door to get inside. Neighbours say a Jamie Reynolds lives at the address with his parents. Wednesday May 29: Reynolds is arrested in a budget hotel in Glasgow city centre by officers from Police Scotland on suspicion of kidnapping Georgia. They also seize a Toyota van which Reynolds used to transport Georgia's body to woodlands where he dumped it, before heading north. CCTV will later show he visited an Odeon cinema in Wrexham while her body was still inside. Thursday May 30: West Mercia Police say the suspect has been arrested on suspicion of murder following 'developments in the investigation'. They stress that Georgia has still not been found. Friday May 31: Police confirm it came to light yesterday that Georgia died at an address in Wellington, Telford. The body of a young female found in woodland on the Nant-y-Grath pass, in north Wales, is believed to be linked to Georgia's disappearance. It is later confirmed to be the teenager. Jamie Reynolds, 22, is charged with her murder. December 2: Reynolds pleads guilty to murder at Stafford Crown Court . Mr Justice Wilkie remands Reynolds in custody until December 19 pending further psychiatric reports. December 19: Reynolds is handed a full life sentence for Georgia's murder after the judge hears he had the potential to go on and become a serial killer. He is only the 50th person in British legal history to be given such a sentence. In court it emerges that Reynolds began hunting for clips of women being strangled six years before the attack. When he was arrested police found 16,800 images and 72 videos of extreme pornography on his computer. It is also revealed that he subscribed to the same 'snuff' website as Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins, featuring videos of murder pornography. April 2nd 2014: Lynette Williams, Georgia's mother, blasts police for failing to properly investigate his earlier crime, saying their daughter's murder could have been prevented.","Georgia Williams was hanged by Jamie Reynolds in May last year .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Quitting the European Union would leave Britain could no longer call itself ‘Great’, the French foreign minister. Laurent Fabius claimed any move to by the UK to sever ties with Brussels would leave the country diminished on the world stage as ‘Small Britain’. The extraordinary intervention came as Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage prepared to go head to head in their second live TV debate on Britain’s membership of the EU. French foreign minister Laurent Fabius claimed the UK would be reduced to Small Britain if it left the European Union . David Cameron has promised to claw back powers from Brussels before staging an in-out referendum by the end of 2o17. The Tory pledge was designed to head off the threat posed by Mr Farage’s Ukip, which wants Britain to leave the EU altogether. Mr Cameron has sought to build alliances with Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands. But socialist France has insisted reform is not a priority. Mr Fabius, the French Foreign Minister in Francois Hollande’s government , claimed Britain would be diminished if it was outside the EU. He was speaking at a conference in Berlin with his colleagues from German and Poland. Asked if he thought Britain would still be a full member of the EU in five years' time, he replied: ‘If it is not, it will not be Great Britain but Small Britain.’ UKIP Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall: 'It is not EU membership that makes Britain a great country. Indeed, our prospects have been harmed by the EU's political union which has made us less prosperous and less democratic. 'Outside of the EU we could be a Great Britain with a global outlook, able to negotiate our own trade deals.' David Cameron, who today met Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, has promised to hold an in-out referendum by 2017 . The remarks are likely to fuel tensions between London and Paris. When Mr Hollande visisted Britain in January, he insisted giving the British people a say on leaving the European Union was 'not urgent' and would do little to assist Mr Cameron's push for reform. Speaking at a press conference alongside Mr Cameron, the French President said: 'France would like the UK to remain within in the EU. France would like to have a more effective European which can attain the objectives which we consider to be essential: growth, employment, energy and of course the capacity to bring in techniques for tomorrow and protect our population.' But he rejected the Mr Cameron's plea for urgent action to renegotiate the power Brussels currently wields: 'France would like the Eurozone to be better co-ordinated, better integrated. And if there are going to be amendments of the text we don’t think for the time being that they are urgent. 'We feel that revising the Treaty is not a priority for the time being.' Tomorrow night Ukip leader Mr Farage and Lib Dem Mr Clegg will take part in the second live TV debate on Britain’s EU membership. Ahead of the clash at 7pm on BBC2, a MailOnline poll revealed 38 per cent of people think Mr Farage is a ‘danger to Britain’ while just 18 per cent said Mr Clegg 'tells the truth’. Tom Mludzinski, head of political . polling at ComRes, said: 'While there is little good news for either . leader here, Nick Clegg should be the more worried. 'After . nearly four years as Deputy Prime Minister he has failed to convince . the British public he is more Prime Ministerial than a leader of a Party . with no MPs. However there is also a warning for Nigel Farage that many . see him as a danger to Britain.' 'One of the most striking difference . came when voters were asked which of the two leaders they most . considered to be ’a bit sleazy’.","Socialist minister claims leaving EU would make country 'Small Britain'

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . and Mark Duell . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's first child is set to push Prince Harry into fourth place in the line of succession to the throne - even if they have a girl. Prince William and Kate's child would move into third place, become more important than Harry and not be subject to the centuries-old law of primogeniture, which puts male heirs ahead of women. He or she will leapfrog Harry by being be the first born of first-in-line Prince Charles's first son. Scroll down for video . Happily married: Only 20 months after the couple were married they are now expecting a baby. The baby will become monarch, regardless of whether it is a boy or a girl . It is anticipated that Harry and . Pippa Middleton could be asked to be the child's godparents, if the . royal couple follow the tradition appointing the best man and maid of . honour from their wedding. The baby will be third in line to the throne regardless of gender after Prime Minister David Cameron agreed a deal with other Commonwealth countries to change the rules on  the royal line of succession which means male heirs will no longer be given priority. This means that in the 15 other countries where the Queen is head of state the rules must be changed. It had been feared there could be a constitutional crisis if the Royal couple had a baby girl before the law was changed. But today's announcement that the . Duchess of Cambridge is expecting the couple's first child - third in line to the throne - has come after the deal was agreed. In . October 2011, David Cameron announced that the 16 Commonwealth . countries where the Queen is head of state had agreed to give female . royals the same rights of succession as their brothers. 'Put . simply, if the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were to have a little . girl, that girl would one day be our queen,” Mr Cameron said. Under . the ancient rules of male primogeniture, first born royal daughters in . direct line to the throne were leapfrogged by their younger male . siblings. The principle was criticised and widely viewed as outdated and discriminatory. The current law of male primogeniture only allows Elizabeth II to be queen because she did not have any brothers. Moves towards constitutional change gathered pace in the wake of the Duke and Duchess’s wedding in April 2011 in anticipation they would produce an offspring. Mr Cameron had previously warned it would take time due to on-going negotiations with the Commonwealth countries where the Queen is also head of state, but at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in October 2011 he confirmed the changes would go ahead. Downing Street said any attempt to alter the law would be a 'difficult and complex matter', with parallel legislation needed in all such Commonwealth nations. It will also involve amendments to some of Britain’s key constitutional documents, such as the Bill of Rights and Coronation Oath Act of 1688, the 1701 Act of Settlement and the 1706 Act of Union with Scotland. Proposed legislation will refer to the descendants of the current Prince of Wales, meaning that William’s first child would follow him in the line of succession, whether a girl or a boy. However, the current generation of royals will not be affected. It will not be retrospective - meaning the Princess Royal will not jump ahead of her younger brothers the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex. Ministers have made clear the changes will apply from October 28, 2011 – the date of the Commonwealth summit where the countries agreed the plans. So close: The Duchess of Cambridge, (centre), Prince William (right) and Prince Harry (left) wave as they pass the Houses of Parliament during the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant in June . The change needs to be legislated for . in the Commonwealth nations of the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, . Jamaica, Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Grenada, Belize, St . Christopher and Nevis, St Lucia, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, St . Vincent and the Grenadines and Papua New Guinea. But this is regarded as assured. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg told the Commons in May: 'If the birds and bees were to deliver that blessing to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and indeed the nation, then that little girl would be covered by the provisions of these changes of the rules of succession because they operate from the time of the declaration of the Commonwealth summit last October. 'It is very important to remember that the rules are de facto in place, even though they have yet to be implemented through legislation in the way that I have described.' The changes mean that, for all descendants of the Prince of Wales, younger sons will no longer take precedence over an elder daughter in the line of succession. Members of the Royal Family who marry a Roman Catholic will also in future be able to succeed to the Crown. And an ancient and unused rule saying . descendants of George II are supposed to gain the consent of the . monarch to marry will only apply to the first six people in the line of . succession. The law was brought in following the . Glorious Revolution – when a Dutch invasion helped overthrow a Papist . king – so that a Catholic could never sit on our throne again. It . also means that the Princess Royal, the Queen’s second born, is just . tenth in line to the throne behind her younger brothers Andrew (fourth) and Edward (seventh). The 15 other countries where Elizabeth II is queen are Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Jamaica, Barbados, the Bahamas, Grenada, Papua New Guinea, the Soloman Islands, Tuvalu, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Belize, Antigua and Barbuda, and St Kitts and Nevis. Queen Elizabeth II, who celebrated 60 years on the throne this year, was only able to become queen because  she did not have any brothers . The Commonwealth leaders also agreed . to overturn the 1701 Act of Settlement, which means that only the . Protestant heirs of the Electress Sophia of Hanover, granddaughter of . James I, can become king or queen. The . Queen hailed the deal on changing the rules as the 53 Commonwealth . countries met last year, saying she wanted the theme of allowing women . to play a full part to last for years. She said: 'The theme this year is Women As Agents of Change. 'It . reminds us of the potential in our societies that is yet to be fully . unlocked and it encourages us to find ways to allow all girls and women . to play their full part. 'We . must continue to strive in our own countries and across the . Commonwealth together to promote that theme in a lasting way beyond this . year.' Her comments were taken as a sign that the Queen approves of the reform. The Commonwealth is a looser group of 53 countries, of which the Queen is the head. Happy: Princess Anne, who presented Afghanistan Operational Service Medals to soldiers from The King's Royal Hussars at Aliwal Barracks in Tidworth today, is currently 10th in line - but would become 11th . Mr Cameron had criticised the existing rules as ’out-dated’ and in need of change. It was also agreed that the barrier to the heir to the throne marrying a Catholic will also be removed, but that it would not affect the position of the Anglican Church as the established Church. The Queen and future monarchs will be Anglicans and Supreme Governor of the Church of England.An ancient rule meaning that all descendants of George II are supposed to require the consent of the monarch before they can marry will also be abolished. The UK government must now introduce legislation to change the 1701 Act of Settlement, the Bill of Rights 1688, the Coronation Oath Act 1688 and the Royal Marriages Act 1772. The new rules on the line of succession were agreed by David Cameron gestures at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Australia last year . But because the rule will be backdated and it will be many years before a female heir will be close to the throne, the government says the change isn't urgent. Government sources have stressed that the new rule will apply only to heirs born after October 2011.Princess Anne, the Princess Royal, would still be placed below her two younger brothers, the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex. Had the rule been in force before, British history would have been very different. Constitutional experts say that in 1509 Margaret Tudor would have taken the throne instead of Henry VIII, and as a result Elizabeth I would never have been Queen. It would also have meant Queen Victoria would have been succeeded by her daughter, Princess Victoria, the Princess Royal, in 1901, and not King Edward VII. When she died just a few months later, her son Kaiser Wilhelm II would have ascended the throne – something which could have prevented the First World War. It is said the Queen of England now would have been the completely unknown Princess Marie Cecile of Prussia. Most European monarchies have already established an equal law of succession - it is in force in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Now only Spain, Liechtenstein and Monaco are left with the old system.","Commonwealth countries have agreed changes to line of succession rules .

"By . Ashley Collman . My fight with Bode: Olympic skier Bode Miller's ex-girlfriend Sara McKenna wrote an emotional essay detailing their bitter custody battle over son Sam . When Sara McKenna learned that her boyfriend Bode Miller didn't want to raise their son together, the two went their seperate ways. The Olympic skier went on to marry Volleyball player Morgan Beck and Mckenna, a former Marine, moved from her home in California to New York to continue her college education. But just two weeks after her son Sam was born, McKenna learned that Miller had filed for custody in California and last September she temporarily lost custody of the boy who went to live with Miller. In an essay for Cosmopolitan magazine, McKenna details the emotional turmoil she went through when she was forced to separate from Sam whom Miller and his new wife started calling 'Nathaniel'. McKenna was working as a firefighter in San Diego when she met Miller through a matchmaker and the two started dating. Three months into their relationship, McKenna learned she was pregnant but when she told Miller he was less than enthused. 'I . told him I wanted to keep the baby. I said he could be involved if he . wanted to and that I would love it if he did. If he didn't want any part . of it, I said that I was going to do it on my own,' McKenna wrote in an . essay for Cosmopolitan. 'I left in tears.' Knowing . that she couldn't continue to balance working as a firefighter and being a . single mother, McKenna decided to move to New York to attend . prestigious Columbia University on the G.I. Bill. Plus sign: McKenna was excited when she tweeted this picture of her positive pregnancy test, but Miller ended up being less-than-enthused at the prospect of fatherhood . When McKenna found out that Miller didn't want to raise their son together she decided to move to New York to finish her education. The Olympic skier went on to marry volleyball player Morgan Beck. Pictured above after his bronze-medal win at the Sochi games . Husband and wife: Miller married Beck (pictured above at Sochi in February) in October 2012 and the two lost a child in a miscarriage the following January . Heroic woman: McKenna is a former Marine who was working as a firefighter when she was set up with Miller through a matchmaker . In . addition to Columbia being a highly-competitive school, McKenna chose . the New York City school because there were breast-feeding rooms on . campus and family networks that would help her to raise Sam. A month before she moved, McKenna texted Miller to let him know her plans but she says he never responded. She was seven-months-pregnant when she arrived in New York and took up her studies one month later. Son . Samuel Bode Miller-McKenna was born on February 23, 2013 and she filed for . temporary custody of the child three days later. But . when Sam was just two weeks old, McKenna learned that her ex-boyfriend . and filed for custody of the child despite never expressing any interest . in being the boy's father. Miller and wife Morgan had also experienced a . miscarriage that January. Chang of heart: When Sam was just two weeks old, McKenna found out that Miller filed for custody of their son in California - sending the papers to her San Diego address where she was no longer living. Father and son pictured together in a shot on Morgan Miller's Instagram . Separated: In September, McKenna lost custody of Sam to Miller and the boy went to live with his skier dad and step-mom in California. Sam and step-mom pictured above . Miller . sent the custody papers to her home in San Diego, despite knowing she . didn't live there, and that set off a complex multi-state custody . battle. Eventually . the case was sent back to California and on September 4, a judge gave . Miller full-custody of Sam calling McKenna's move to New York . 'irresponsible' and 'irreprehensible'. After losing Sam, McKenna's life turned into a 'nightmare' and she quit school and her job. But . she soon realized that being 'catatonic wasn't helping matters'. And . she re-enrolled and continued her studies while relentlessly pursuing a . way to get Sam back for good. All . the while McKenna tracked her son's life with Miller on her ex and his . new wife's social media profiles and noticed they were calling him . 'Nathaniel'. 'I . would look for photos of Sam on Instagram and Twitter and saw that Bode . was calling him Nathaniel. That was really heartbreaking. Our son’s . name is Samuel Bode Miller-McKenna. Calling him anything else is just . confusing. 'There were also tons of photos of Bode’s wife holding Sam like he was her baby. That was very hard to bear,' McKenna added. New name: Miller and his new wife Morgan started calling Sam 'Nathaniel' as evidenced by the baby shower pictures Mrs Miller posted on her Instagram . Step-mom: McKenna says she followed her son's life with her ex on Instagram and found the pictures of Morgan Miller treating Sam like she was his mother 'very hard to bear'. Above a shot of Sam and Morgan on her Instagram . The next time McKenna saw her son was at a court hearing on November 25 where she won back custody of Sam. 'I . was sitting in court when I heard Sam’s sweet little voice down the . hall. As soon as I saw him, I reached out and said, “I missed you!” He . put his arms out for me and said, “Mama!” We still had to deal with a . court hearing that day, but I didn’t care. I could breathe again. I was . whole. The next day was my birthday. I woke up next to Sam, and he . started giggling — that was the best present I’ve ever received in my . life,' she said. McKenna is back living in New York and hopes to work out stable life for Sam where he can see both of his parents. 'That's all I want for our son,' she wrote. The . experience of losing her son has also inspired her studies as she is . now pursuing a law degree to help others in her position.

"An electrician whose blunders led to a young mother being electrocuted and killed while mopping up leaking water in her kitchen has avoided jail and been fined just £1,000. Neil Hoult, 53, signed off the faulty wiring which caused Emma Shaw to receive a huge 230-volt electric shock when water poured into her kitchen. Tragic Ms Shaw, 22, was battling to stop her home being flooded after her boiler leaked on December 14, 2007. Neil Hoult, left, who signed off the electrical work, has been found guilty of breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act after mum-of-one Emma Shaw was electrocuted . Tragic Ms Shaw was found by her boyfriend, Andrew Cross, after dying yards from where her son was playing . The mum-of-one was trying to turn off her stopcock but suffered a 'catastrophic' shock while her one-year-old son Brayden played in the living room nearby. Her body was discovered by her boyfriend Andrew Cross when he returned to their flat off Grafton Road in West Bromwich, West Midands. Mr Cross, 32, had rushed back from work after Ms Shaw sent him frantic text messages about the damaged pipe, saying: ‘the electrics were sparking’. A court heard the supermarket worker’s death was caused by a catalogue of blunders by 'negligent' electricians who worked on the 'inadequate' boiler. The block of one and two bedroom flats had been built less than two years earlier in 2006 and a company called Anchor Electrical and Building Services were responsible for all the insulations in the building. Electrician's mate Christopher Tomkins carried out electrical insulation tests in the flat where Miss Shaw lived on March 8, 2006. Ms Shaw's mother, Diane Potter, right, has said she is 'very disappointed' by Hoult's £1,000 fine . The work at Ms Shaw's flat on Grafton Road, West Bromwich was approved the year before her fatal accident . Tomkins, 52, who worked for Anchor, said the circuits were safe and also signed a document to say he had exercised reasonable care. His work was then confirmed as accurate by qualified supervisor Neil Hoult, 53, who agreed the electrical circuits were problem-free. Tomkins and Hoult, both from Rowley Regis, West Midlands, went on trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court last month accused of breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. Hoult was found guilty of the charge on Friday while co-accused Tomkins was cleared by a jury. But Hoult avoided jail yesterday and was instead ordered to pay a £1,000 fine - the only penalty available under the Act. Passing sentence, Judge Michael Dudley explained law set out he could only fix an amount the defendant could afford to pay within 12 months, which is why it 'may seem light'. Ms Shaw's family say they have been unable to grieve during the six years it has taken for the case to come to court . Flowers left at the building, which was built less than two years before the tragic death in 2007 . The judge told Hoult: 'You have been convicted of a grave breach of duty. 'The testing of electrical circuits is absolutely vital. You were responsible for the failures in checking paperwork. 'Because of your failures and those of others who created this situation, you failed to detect a metal stud frame behind a plaster board at the house was live for a period of some 18 months. 'There was a leak in the boiler, the water soaked the carpet and that too became live and led to the inevitable death of Emma Shaw. 'I accept there are a number of other individuals who are as culpable as you.' The court heard that during the construction of the flat a screw used to attach plasterboard to the metal frame in the wall in the store cupboard penetrated a cable causing it to become live. As a result of the blunder, when Miss Shaw’s boiler leaked, the puddle of water in her store cupboard crept under the skirting board and touched the frame - meaning it was also live. Ms Shaw, who worked in a local Asda, was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics. After the case, Ms Shaw's angry mum Diane Potter, 49, described the sentence as a 'joke' outside court. She said: 'I am so very disappointed. It just does not seem right to fine someone only £1,000 for such a terrible thing. 'That is a very small price to pay for a death.  It has been over six years since I lost Emma and I haven’t really been able to grieve.  But now at last I have closure.'","Emma Shaw, 22, was electrocuted and died when her kitchen flooded in 2007 .

"By . Harriet Arkell . MEP Nikki Sinclaire, 45, says she was raped as she walked through central London at night . Britain's first sex-change parliamentarian has told how she became a lesbian after she was raped. Former UKIP MEP Nikki Sinclaire, 45, was born a boy but had gender reassignment surgery on the NHS 18 years ago. Today she revealed how four years after the operation, just as she was beginning to find women attractive, she was raped by a man, and subsequently realised she was a lesbian. Miss Sinclaire, MEP for the West Midlands, founded a new party, We Demand A Referendum Now, campaigning for a referendum on British membership of the European Union, after she was ejected from UKIP after a row over policy. The ambitious politician now hopes to become Britain's first transsexual MP. Today she told The Sun how she was the victim of a brutal assault in central London, which she described as  'the most horrendous experience of my life', and one which contributed to her realising she was a lesbian. In a revealing interview with the paper, Miss Sinclaire said she was walking home along a busy road in central London shortly before midnight when someone gripped her arm and kicked her leg, knocking her over. She said: 'I gasped, overbalanced and landed painfully with a suffocating weight on top of me.' After the attack, which she said left her feeling vulnerable despite being brought up in the capital, she went with a nurse friend to a hospital in Dartford, Kent, where DNA samples were taken and medics photographed her bruised body. Because the attack happened in 1999, before the 2004 change in the law that recognised transsexual people's new genders, the rape was only classified as an assault. Miss Sinclaire said that she had begun to feel attracted to women shortly before the attack, and had her first sexual experience with a woman with a lesbian she met playing pool in Liverpool. She said she put the 'scary' idea that she might be attracted to women out of her mind, but said the rape made her 'very anti-men', and contributed to her realising she was a lesbian soon afterwards. Now the anti-EU politician, who intends to become an MP and cabinet minister, has a long-term female partner who shuns publicity.  They do not live together but have been in a relationship since 2006. She said her fellow UKIP politicians had been very accepting of her sexuality, whereas she had encountered the most homophobia from Liberal Democrats. Miss Sinclaire said yesterday she had been 'overwhelmed by all the support' she had received after revealing in the Sun on Sunday that she had had gender reassignment surgery at the age of 23. Her new book, Never Give Up, tells how until now only her family and close friends were aware of her past. Campaign: Miss Sinclaire, fourth from the left, joins other MPs and MEPs in delivering a 100,000 name petition for a referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union to 10 Downing Street in London . The book's foreword said: 'There was . one great secret that Nikki never shared with anyone other than her . family and close friends. 'Hers is a powerful personal story. Yet she insists it is only one facet of her life, and though it . tormented her childhood and teenage years, it is one that no longer . dominates her or her future. It adds: 'As the first ""sex change"" parliamentarian in Britain, Nikki Sinclaire has made history. 'But she is likely to be far happier, in the future, being known less as a statistic than for her conviction politics.' Miss Sinclaire is keen that her . revelations do not overshadow her politicial ambition, and has . commissioned a poll to see whether voters minded if a candidate was . transsexual.  It showed that two-thirds of people said it would make no . difference to how they voted and fewer than 10 per cent said it would . make them much less likely to favour a candidate. In her autobiography Never Give Up, Miss Sinclaire also writes about her determination for an EU referendum . 'I don't want my past to overshadow it and believe my constituents will continue to support me,' she said. Miss Sinclaire, who suffered from depression throughout her teenager years, said she 'knew she was different'  before undergoing gender reassignment surgery at the age of 23. The politician was arrested by West Midlands Police in February last year as part of a probe into allowances and expenses. However, Miss Sinclaire denies the allegations and remains on bail. Never Give Up, published by Junius Press, is released on November 25.","Nikki Sinclaire, 45, tells of 'horrendous' attack by a man in central London .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Breach: Julie Griffiths, pictured yesterday outside court, has been fined for launching a noisy 45-minute rant at her husband . A wife from hell who was given an Asbo for shouting at her own husband so loudly it kept her neighbours awake has been fined for breaching the order. Julie Griffiths, 45, was hauled before a court and ordered to pay £270 after a blistering 45-minute rant at her husband for buying the wrong type of scratch card. Griffiths is banned from making loud noises which can be heard by those who live either side of her terraced house in Talke, Staffordshire, but breached the conditions when she lost her temper with her 65-year-old husband, Norman. Neighbours have been complaining about her outbursts since 1999, and it was around thirteen years before she received her Asbo in December 2012. She has been in court once before after a noisy argument last year. She appeared before magistrates at the North Staffordshire Justice Centre, who heard that Griffiths sent her husband to the newsagents to buy a lottery scratch card on March 9. But when he returned to their home she flew into a lengthy rage for because he had not bought the one she wanted. Prosecutor Steve Knowles said residents living near their £75,000 home became concerned when they heard Griffiths shouting. He said: 'Neighbours living near to the mid-terrace property confirmed that they heard Julie Griffiths screaming, shouting and swearing and later banging on the walls at her home. 'They say it went on for about 45 minutes. One of the neighbours used his mobile phone to record the noise and Griffiths’ voice was getting louder and louder. 'Griffiths was interviewed and said she was aware of the Asbo which had been imposed. She confirmed she had an argument with her husband who had gone out to get a lottery ticket. 'Griffiths said that the ticket was wrong and that had made her angry. She admitted that she was shouting and screaming and was aware that this was a breach.' Rant: Griffiths, pictured in 2012 around the time of her ASBO being issued, breached her order last year as well . Night-shift worker Griffiths was originally handed a five-year Asbo in December 2012 after noise monitoring equipment was installed to measure the volume of her shouting. The ruling prohibits her from creating noise audible to neighbouring properties, shouting, screaming or banging on internal doors and communicating with certain neighbours. But she breached it just four months later it was imposed when she argued with Norman last April. Yesterday she admitted breaching the order for a second time. Alan Dawson, defending, said: 'The circumstances are that Julie Griffiths lives in a terrace with her husband of 25 years. Unlucky neighbours: People have been complaining about the noise Griffiths made since 1999 . 'She has an Asbo but during this day in particular, there is an argument at the address and it’s as simple as that. 'There is no intention by this lady to encroach on the neighbours, she confined the argument to the house, she was not out on the streets, but the neighbours could hear it. 'Her husband said he slammed the door when he left the room and that was not her. Griffiths admitted the offence and accepts what she has done. 'She has lived at the address for 26 years and it is only quite recently that these issues have been reported. This is a lady who wants to get on with her life and keep herself to herself, but there is going to be some escape of noise in relation to her neighbours.' Magistrates told Griffiths that breaching an Asbo was a serious offence but agreed to be lenient on this occasion. She was fined £165 and ordered to pay £105 in court costs. She must also attend anger management classes. Griffiths, who was escorted from court by two police officers, refused to comment after the hearing. Julie Griffiths's rants will be nothing new to her long-suffering neighbours, who have been complaining about her for more than a decade. She was first given a noise abatement order in 1999, and was fined £500 for a breach which was recorded in 2010. Over the next two years the situation became especially dire, and the local council eventually installed noise monitoring equipment in 2012. Between July and October of that year, Griffiths breached her noise abatement order an incredible 47 times. Neighbours revealed that she has been banned from family events thanks to her short temper. After receiving her Asbo in December 2012, it was just four months until she was back in court for breaching the order. She was then fined £750 and ordered to pay costs of £85. Irate neighbours eventually revealed the contents of her furious rants, in which she orders the long-suffering Norman Griffiths out of the house. In . one from the morning of August 27 2012, she can be heard shouting: 'Get . out if you want a fag. Go! You’re not smoking in bed, I said get out if . you want a fag! Get out if you want a fag! Get your shoes on and get out . if you want a fag. Now get out.’ Griffiths then continues her . rant, screeching: ‘Not gone yet, can’t hear the door, get your shoes on . and get out, otherwise you’ll know about it. Get out, Do I have to say it . again.’ In another she tell her husband: 'Don't worry Norman, I'm just about sick of you!' Further clips show she is aware of being recorded, but continues regardless. She says: 'Stop ignoring me, you are. I am being recorded by them next door now thanks to you.''They are recording every day. Because of you  I keep f*****g up.'","Julie Griffiths, 45, was given an Asbo in 2012 because of furious ranting .

"By . Joel Christie . It's been served up as both masterful for taking attention off the breakdown of her 10-year marriage, and moronic for its new-age pretentiousness. But the psychotherapist who created the concept of 'conscious uncoupling' - two words being hailed the 'term of 2014' after Gwyneth Paltrow used it to announce her 'friendly divorce' to Coldplay frontman Chris Martin - said she has never met or worked with the actress. However Katherine Woodward Thomas, who is also a yoga teacher, said the Iron Man star may have been one of her many anonymous online students, with a five-week Conscious Uncoupling course having been available for two years at a cost of $297. Paltrow was undeniably aware of the true meaning of the term last week when she announced her divorce on her website, Goop, in an attempt to establish their separation as amicable, Thomas said. Scroll down for video . Write caption here . Causing a stir: The way in which Gwyneth Paltrow chose to announce her separation from husband of 10 years, Chris Martin, created all kinds of controversy, with critics calling her pretentious and trying to make it seem her divorce was more special than others . Officially uncoupled: Paltrow met Martin backstage at a Coldplay concert in October 2002 and the pair were married in December 2003. They have now separated but will continue to 'co-parent' their two children . 'No (I haven't met Gwyneth) but I teach online courses and I never really know who is taking the courses or not,' she told TODAY on Monday. 'The company that produces my courses is very careful to protect the anonymitiy of the clients that come in. 'I think most of us are pretty familiar with an antagonistic, angry process with ending a relationship, but it doesn't have to be this way. 'So a concious uncoupling is a breakup that is characterized by goodwill, by generosity and by respect. 'It leaves both parties feeling both parties feeling valued and appreciated for all that is shared. 'Its about two people striving to reduce the damage to themselves and theiry children, if there are children involved.' Thomas went on to thank the couple for using their own journey to help and inform others. 'They took their time of personal heartache and they used it to really introduce an end to relationships that is healthy and less contensious,' she said. Psychotherapist Katherine Woodward wrote a seven-week guide to finding one's true love but, after her marriage broke down, was compelled to write about handling divorce with ease, which she called Conscious Uncoupling . Thomas told The New York Times that she first found out Paltrow had used her term when she opened her laptop last week to a flood of emails about the two-year-old phrase. However she was also quick to establish that 'Concious Uncoupling' - which she has transformed into a business - was first coined by a friend. Thomas had written a book about a seven-week formula that could attract 'the love of your life', based on her own relationship with her then-husband. However when the marriage ended in divorce, she felt compelled to write a follow-up. She was discussing divorce one day with a filmmaker friend, who came up with the 'concious uncoupling' term on the spot. Thomas calls this her 'eureka moment', and immediately rushed to purchase the URL, eventually creating a workshop on the phrase. Still together: Despite announcing their separation, Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow spent the weekend vacationing in the Bahamas with their two children. On Friday night they were seen out with friends at a restaurant . Paltrow and Martin, meanwhile, seem to be keeping good on their uncoupling promise. The estranged couple are currently on vacation together, along with their children Apple, 9, and Moses, 7, on the Bahamian island of Eleuthera. The two enjoyed a parents-night-out on Friday at a beachfront restaurant with friendss and were seen sharing laughs.","Psychotherapist and yoga teacher Katherine Woodward Thomas, 56, said she developed a concept called 'conscious uncoupling' following the breakdown of her marriage .

"By . Debbi Marco . Watching the neighbours stroll past my house always makes me smile. Why? Because I can tell how jealous they are. For I know they will be observing the latest costly improvements to our four-bedroom, three-storey property and furiously calculating how much it would take to do the same to their far more inferior homes. The answer? Not far off £200,000. My husband Matt, 32, a sports sponsorship manager, and I have spent the past four years pouring all of our savings into making sure ours is the best house on our street — because I wanted ours to be one that people stopped, stared and pointed at, for all the right reasons. Pride: Debbi Marco outside her home (on the left) on which she spent £200,000 in home improvements . Improvement: The value of Debbi's house has increased by £350,000 following the extensive renovation work . We live in Richmond, Surrey, and our home — with its superior size, beautifully manicured garden and gleaming cream exterior — is head and shoulders above any others on our suburban street. The improvements may have cost us £189,000 in the end, but it’s been worth it just to see the look on our neighbours’ faces. Last week, a survey revealed that 31 per cent of Brits admit, like us, to carrying out home improvements just to ensure their property is the envy of the neighbourhood. Even when we bought our home for £305,000 in 2009, I made sure we invested in the shabby corner plot because I knew that it had the most potential. We had inherited some money and were keen to buy somewhere that would be a good long-term investment — at least, that was my husband’s main motivation. Secretly, I couldn’t bear to be the anonymous owner  of a distinctly average property, indistinguishable from the rest. I wanted to live in the most talked-about house in the area. But it wasn’t going to be easy on our relatively small budget. At first, all we could find were formulaic cottages which would be impossible to improve and enlarge. Then finally, after scouring property websites for months, I found the perfect project. Before: The old-fashioned kitchen needed to be ripped out and completely remodelled . After: Debbi's kitchen now includes state-of-the-art fittings and the latest, most expensive appliances . It was, at the time, a . scruffy-looking three-bedroom semi on a noisy main road. There had been . so little interest in it that the asking price had dropped by £100,000 . in just six months. Clearly, . the other buyers had been underwhelmed by the worn Seventies carpets, . nicotine stains on the once-cream walls and faded flock wallpaper. Plus . the only toilet was in the kitchen. But I had my eye on bigger things. I . had dreams of property grandeur. For . a start, this house was on a corner plot, which meant there would be . scope for a double-storey side extension. There was a 60sq ft garden . which could easily take it and the roof was the perfect height to add a . loft conversion. Subject of . course to planning permission, this unloved property could be . transformed from an ugly duckling of a house into a beautiful swan-like . home. Maybe not quite a  mansion of Beckham proportions, but certainly . something to be proud of. Old fashioned: The house was in a dingy state and was full of retro furniture when the old owner lived there . Chic: The kitchen and sitting room have been totally revamped with modern furniture and pale walls . So we set the wheels in motion and . offered even less than the much-reduced asking price. 'It’s not really . what we were after,' I told the seller. 'It needs a total refurb and the . damp is horrendous.' The seller caved and our offer of £305,000 was . accepted. We moved in and lived in squalor for . 12 months while we sorted out all the paperwork. During this time I . could sense the local sniggers. Our house was shabby and unloved — just . what were we thinking, buying something that nobody wanted? 'You’ll . need a lot of paint to make that look nice,' nodded one neighbour as he . strolled past to collect his morning paper. But I knew I’d prove him . wrong. I hadn’t spent the last year watching back-to-back episodes of . Property Ladder and Grand Designs for nothing. It . took three months for our house to be almost demolished and re-built. Builders stripped the house back to the brickwork, took the roof off, . the windows and doors came out and the side and back of the house were . knocked off. By now I was three months pregnant . with our son Sam, now two, so we moved into a friend’s flat round the . corner to escape the dust, dirt and constant drilling. As . new foundations were dug and reams of scaffolding erected the . neighbours started to gawp. Even the roof tiles were removed leaving the . wooden beams exposed to  the sky. Elegant: Once a poky boxroom, the master bedroom, which has its own ensuite bathroom, is now a pretty, soothing place to sleep . Grotty: The exterior needed a serious paint job but not as much as the dingy interior . 'It’s . going to be big,' speculated one neighbour as she walked past, stopping . at my gate to admire the building site. 'Huge,' I confirmed, enjoying . her obvious envy. As well . as the double-storey extension to the back of the house, brand new . walls, windows and roof, we extended our tiny galley kitchen to over . 300sq ft of bespoke German-designed sleek modernity. I exploded with pride every time I looked at my luxury Rangemaster oven and freestanding Samsung double-door refrigerator. Our . tiny box room became the master bedroom with over £3,000 worth of . fitted wardrobes and a luxury en-suite bathroom. No expense was spared . on our walk-in Grohe shower with a monsoon showerhead and Duravit . bathroom suite. We had . real £2,000 oak flooring laid that covered the ground floor and a plush . wool striped carpet up the stairs and in each of the three huge . bedrooms. Spacious: The huge garden was one of the reasons why Debbi and Matt thought the house had potential . Suddenly, we were . the talk of the street. Whenever I opened the door to put the rubbish . out, passers-by would crane their necks to get a glimpse inside. Neighbours would stop us on the . street and make hints about how nice it would be to come round so they . could ‘admire’ the work. And we were always happy to oblige. What would . be the point of doing £150,000 worth of renovation if we weren’t going . to show it off? I’d even . turn on the lights  and leave the curtains open at night just so our . neighbours could get a glimpse into our fabulous home. At . Christmas we were invited to an exclusive drinks soiree held by the . most established residents on the street. Only a chosen few locals were . invited and there was no guessing why we had been awarded our place. The . neighbours couldn’t stop themselves asking for every detail of our . house renovation. 'Didn’t you go crazy having to deal with all those . builders?' one of them asked pointedly. 'Your . house has been the talk of the playground,' another commented. 'We all . thought you were mad buying that house, but now . . .' she trailed off. 'Well, if anyone doubted me, they’re now eating their words,' I replied haughtily. Of COURSE, it’s not been without sacrifices. We’ve blown all our savings on the house and forgone luxury holidays for wet and windy trips to the Isle of Wight. Not . to mention builders, plumbers and electricians stampeding through our . house. Plus it wasn’t easy being pregnant throughout the renovations — . my swirling hormones would get in the way of choosing the best bathroom . tiles. But still I wasn’t happy. I wanted to do a loft extension, so persuaded my husband to take out a £40,000 loan at the beginning of this year. The neighbours were incredulous when the second lot of scaffolding went up. 'More work?' they  asked. 'Surely there’s nothing left to do?' The bitter tone in their voices rather pleased me. I loved the fact we were keeping tongues wagging.Now we own the only four-bedroom house on the street and the other properties — a mixture of semi-detached houses and terraced railway properties — are shabby and poky in comparison. Plus we’ve increased our house price by £350,000. One of our neighbours has just put their house up for sale and I couldn’t help but wonder whether it was because they were upset about being overshadowed by us. One of my friends went to look around and came away saying: 'Of course, we could never buy it because any improvements we made would never be as good as yours.' I smiled silently, knowing she was absolutely right.","Debbi Marco bought her house in a run-down, near derelict state .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Election defeat in 2015 could spell the end of the Labour party, its biggest union donor warned today. Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, said Ed Miliband was heading for catastrophe if he offered a ‘pale shade of austerity’ to voters at the general election. And he threatened to withdraw millions of pounds in funding to Labour if it fails to draw up a radical, left-wing manifesto. Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite, said Ed Miliband was heading for catastrophe if he offered a ¿pale shade of austerity¿ to voters at the general election . Unite has given almost £11million to Labour since Mr Miliband became leader in 2010, some 27 per cent of all donations received. Speaking to a press gallery lunch today, Mr McCluskey told journalists it is ‘grumble time’ in the Labour party, with senior figures split between offering radical change and ‘shrinking the offer’ to limp over 35 per cent of the vote. He said: ‘I can envisage a debate taking place if Labour lost the election next May. I fear for the future of the Labour party and so these are serious debates. At this point in time in our history we have to kind of consider all of those issues, at the moment, though that’s not on our agenda.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband is warned without a radical policy offer he will be defeated in 2015 . He called for more powerful unions, a £1.50 . increase in the minimum wage and referenda on returning the railways . and energy companies to public ownership. Insisting . he makes ‘no apology for Unite being engaged in political life’, Mr . McCluskey hinted that he could switch support to a new workers’ party if . Labour stumbled. He claimed . that with the economy growing but the future still uncertaing, David . Cameron could replicate US President Barack Obama by comnvicng the . electorate to stick with what they know. Mr . McCluskey said: ‘It is grumble time at the moment going on in the . [Labour party]. People are getting slightly uneasy that there is not a . cohesive vision. My understanding is that it is being worked on. ‘I am confident that what will emerge is a platform to take to the British electorate. I hope that it will be an alternative. ‘If it’s a pale shade of austerity then I believe Labour will be defeated at the next election. ‘Obama went to the electorate and said stick with me. That is exactly what the Prime Minister will be doing. ‘I believe the British electorate are of a mind unless there is a real alternative to say you know what, we best stick with the devil we know. ‘Ed’s challenge is - I hope he will pick this up sooner rather than later - is to prove he is on the side of ordinary people.’ There has been growing dissent in senior Labour circles about the lack of direction. Election co-ordinate Douglas Alexander has been briefed against as 'impossible' to work with while shadow chancellor Ed Balls is accused of blocking radical - expensive - reforms. Mr McCluskey appeared dismissive of Labour election coordinator Douglas Alexander (left), who has been accused of failing to secure a victory for Mr Miliband . Scottish voters could back independence if they think the Tories will win the 2015 general election, Len McLuskey warned. Unite has not taken sides in September's referendum campaign, as this would split the union - some 40 per cent of whose Scottish members voted SNP in 2011. Labour's poll lead has slumped to just one point in recent days. Mr McCluskey suggested that the prospect of a second term as Prime Minister for Mr Cameron could be enough to propel Scotland's voters into the Yes camp. The Unite boss said: 'Remember we are talking about a nation that has kicked the Tories out of Scotland - there's only one (Conservative) Westminster MP up in Scotland. 'If, come September, the opinion polls down here are demonstrating that perhaps the Tories might get back into power, then that might have an influence on which way the Scottish people vote. 'They may take the view ""I'm not putting up with another five years of Tory policies, we may as well vote for independence and take our chance now"".' Mr McCluskey went on: ‘Miliband has . got to give hope to people. He has got to demonstrate that he will do . something different in power. ‘At . the moment  in the Labour party there is an argument going on between . those who want a transformative programme and those who want to shrink . the offer. ‘If we do that we . will lose. But if we put forward hope then I believe that Labour will . get back into power. The quicker he does that the better.’ In . a stark warning to Mr Miliband, he insisted that Unite’s rules state it . can only fund the Labour party – but that could change. ‘Can . I ever envisage a rules conference voting to disaffiliate from Labour? I . can, I can, and that’s a challenge to Ed Miliband because I believe the . Labour party is at a crossroads, this is a watershed. ‘Labour . consistently has to demonstrate that it is our voice, we created it. At . the beginning of the last century, ordinary working people sat down tto . create a party of labour so that we had a voice in the political arena. ‘Is . Labour still that voice? I’m hoping the answer to that is yes, but we . are at a stage in politics at the moment where just bumbling along in . the old ways is not going to happen any more.’ Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Len McCluskey is still calling the shots on Labour’s candidates, policies, and their whole future as a party. Today, he demanded more spending, more borrowing, and more taxes – exactly the same old Labour policies that got us into a mess in the first place. 'What’s more, he threatened to cut off the money if he didn’t get his way. Ed Miliband is a puppet on Len McCluskey’s string: shoved around by the trade union bosses who pay Labour’s bills. And it’s hardworking people who would pay the price for that, with fewer jobs and a less secure economy. ‘Ed Miliband is simply too weak to stand up to Len McCluskey, which means he would be too weak to run the country.’","Unite general secretary Len McCluskey warns he could withdraw cash .

"By . Martin Robinson . Paedophile: Michael Brignull has been jailed for 11 years but the mother of one of his victims refused to believe that her child was abused . A mother has spoken of her shame after she refused to believe her daughter was abused until police showed her a photograph of her being attacked by a paedophile now in jail for his sex crimes. Michael Brignull, 60, was a described as a 'surrogate grandfather' to the young woman but it later emerged he abused her throughout her childhood. He is is starting an 11-year prison sentence after he was convicted of possessing child pornography and a string of attacks including two attempted rapes. The girl's mother, 43, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said his crimes 'ripped her family apart' because they had known Brignull for 27 years. 'We were so close Mick used to come to our house for Christmas dinner and my children used to stay with him for school holidays,' she said. 'He was a surrogate grandfather to them.' The victim, now aged 17, was at her brother's 18th birthday party, when she told a family friend she was being abused by Brignull, of Thorney Bay Caravan Park, Canvey, Essex. Her mother said: 'My first reaction was ""oh my God, she is a bloody liar"". I thought she was jealous her brother was getting all the attention because it was his 18th. I 110 per cent did not believe her.' The next day the mother confronted her then 16-year-old daughter. She said: 'I said to her ""put your coat on, we are going to the police station"". She was hysterical and refused to go. Then a few days later she wrote me a letter explaining what Mick had done to her. 'She said she didn't want to talk about it, so I wrote her a letter back. We carried on like that. Writing letters back and forwards to eachother. 'Then I took the letters to the police.' Terrible: The victim, now aged 17, was at her brother's 18th birthday party, when she told a family friend she was being abused by Brignull, of Thorney Bay Caravan Park, Canvey, Essex (pictured) In March 2012, Essex Police officers went to the family's home. The woman said: 'They produced a cropped picture they had found on Mick's laptop. It was a picture of my daughter being abused. 'I was devastated I had not believed her and this could go on without me ever suspecting. I kept saying over and over, 'this cannot be true'. It is believed the victim was abused for much of her childhood. The victim's mother added: 'I found out later my daughter didn't want to tell me what was happening because she didn't want to upset me. 'This has ripped our family apart and to my shame I didn't believe my little girl.' The victim has since moved away from Essex with her family. Police described Brignull as a 'dangerous man who wormed his way in to a family'. Investigating officer, Det Con Mark Matthews, from Essex Police, said Brignull was someone who 'threatened the safety of others'. Det Con Matthews, said: 'He is a dangerous man who wormed his way into this family and then abused his position . of trust over a prolonged period of time.'","Michael Brignull, 60, of Canvey, Essex, has been jailed for 11 years .

"By . Jill Reilly . The patient claimed GP Peter Rubin was 'forceful and persistent' as he persuaded her to have sex . A mother broke down in tears today as she told a court of the moment she 'froze' as she was seduced by her doctor in his surgery on Christmas Eve. The patient, in her 40s, claimed 53-year old married GP Peter Rubin was 'forceful and persistant' as he persuaded her to have sex after they were left alone together. Afterwards he prescribed her with the morning-after pill saying: 'You should take this because it will be just my luck we will be in an anti-natal clinic.' At a medical tribunal the woman - a mother of two - who had gone to the surgery to swap Christmas presents with Rubin ahead of a carol concert said: 'I didn’t go there for that sort of encounter. I went to exchange presents. 'He kept persisting and in the end he got his way. He had sex with me. I wasn’t participating. He was very strong and forceful.' The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service was told the sexual encounter occurred during a five year 'improper relationship' Rubin had with the woman known as Patient A whose relationship with her partner was on the rocks. The Manchester hearing was told he was doctor to Patient A’s family at the Woodlands Medical Centre in Didcot, Oxfordshire. But trouble began when she began seeking treatment from him in July 2007 after suffering injuries in a horse-riding accident in which she fell out of the carriage of her pony and trap. She said: 'I probably should have gone to A & E but I had to pick my child up from school and didn’t want any risk of going to hospital so got an appointment at the local surgery. 'I had mild concussion and severe bruises throughout my body. I saw Dr Rubin and I had time before the appointment to clean myself up. 'I purposely wore green khaki trousers . I could lift up so I could show him my knee without having to lift . anything up. I don’t like removing items and because it was a male . doctor my instinct was that I would wear loose fitting clothing. 'I think my injuries were more severe than he realised. He asked to remove my trousers and I said ‘no’ and he respected that.' Rubin later bumped into Patient A in a Tesco store and he gave her his personal mobile number 'in case she needed anything'. The patient, in her 40s, claimed afterwards he prescribed her with the morning-after pill saying: 'You should take this because it will be just my luck we will be in an anti-natal clinic' The next month she suffered whiplash injury in a car accident whilst she was taking an Italian girl who had been staying with her to Heathrow Airport. The following day it was a birthday and she received a Prada phone in a parcel which was opened by her boyfriend. She then went to see Rubin for a consultation about her injuries. 'My suspicions were the was phone was possibly from Dr Rubin,' said Patient A. 'I don’t celebrate birthdays and he had made comments about my phone that I couldn’t send photos with texts. Very few people knew it was my birthday. 'I wasn’t in a great position and felt quite rough so he gave me a hug. 'I didn’t return the hug and that’s when he made comments saying 'why doesn’t any of his patients wear nice underwear' which I found very strange.’ 'I do clearly remember him getting out a bag which contained several SIM cards and he said take some of these. 'He said he was given a lot because he was a good client. I set the phone up and at some stage we must have exchanged numbers and that’s when the texts started.' At Christmas 2007 Rubin bought her children a Wii console as a ‘reward’ for a son being brave during a blood test. The pair had lunch together and later he told Patient A he was getting her a Christmas present. She decided that she should buy him a present in return and she went to the surgery on Christmas Eve only to have intercourse with him. Rubin then prescribed her with antiobiotics for a sore throat to give her an excuse for not being at the carol concert. Patient A said: 'We went to the staff room an he said the cleaners were still cleaning then we went down to his room. 'I didn’t feel at all comfortable. We were the only two people in the surgery. There was low lighting and at that stage he made passes towards me. I froze. 'Afterwards he said he had to do something on the computer before I could go. I already had a prescription for antibiotics then he gave me the morning after pill. 'He later apologised for what happened on Xmas eve. He described himself as a bastard and said he always put himself first. ‘ . 'He told me he was close to leaving his wife and I was made to feel like the guilty part of it. I did in a certain way forgive him. 'He made about three of four visits to my home during the day time. I knew it was wrong. There was one time he was around the kitchen table and started fondling me and another occasion he wanted to see my bedroom and take me upstairs. 'That was when he hit his head on the beam which I had warned him about. 'Finally I was strong enough to say no. There were messages that go on to 2012. He would be silent then he would get in touch. One time was that he had a pony and trap to sell and wanted my help. 'In 2012 he passed me when I was on my horse and said something like ‘nice bum’ and I text back saying I had a problem with my knee and he gave me an appointment. 'I purposely wore loose trousers which would roll up so he could see my knee. I was with my daughter and the first thing he asked was that I got on the bed and took my trousers off which I refused to do. 'He insisted that he wanted them off so I started battling with him trying to pull them off and me keeping them on. My daughter asked if I was alright. 'I asked why he needed to take them down and he said he needed to feel my groin area. He was trying forcefully to get them down. 'In the end he stuck his hands down my trousers. I said he hadn’t even looked at my knee and he said he would give me antibiotics.' Patient A later confided in one of her partners about what had happened and an investigation started. It emerged Rubin altering records to say the emergency contraception had been ‘added by mistake’ to cover up his tracks. He urged Patient A to withdraw her complaint because he feared being thrown out of his home by his wife. Dr Rubin was suspended in November 2012. It emerged he had admitted asking a 21-year-old female university student to kiss him and allowing her to do it during a consultation on June 17 2012 - but denies it was sexually motivated and insists it was ‘for a joke’. The tribunal continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","GP Peter Rubin, 53, was 'forceful and persistent' claimed the woman .

"By . Lizzie Parry . A dental nurse poisoned her boss's coffee with mercury after being disciplined for leaving a patient in the chair while she went out for lunch, a court has heard. Ravinder Kaur, 35, allegedly spiked Laura Knowles’ hot drink with the metal used to make fillings in an act of ‘spite and revenge’. Ms Knowles panicked and went as 'white as a ghost', in front of her colleagues at the Shams Moopen Dental Practice in Shefford, Bedfordshire, Blackfriars Crown Court heard. Trial: Dental nurse Ravinder Kaur (left) is accused of poisoning her boss Laura Knowles' (right) coffee with capsules of the metal mercury. It is said the 35-year-old acted out of 'spite and revenge' The practice manager was taken to hospital, after complaining stomach cramps after downing the noxious drink. Prosecutor Laura Blackband told the court: ‘The Crown’s case is that Ms Kaur, acting out of spite or revenge, took a capsule or a number of capsules of mercury, and tipped it into a mug and handed the cup of coffee to Ms Knowles to drink. ‘Ms Knowles sipped the coffee halfway through when she realised something wasn’t right with it. ‘She tipped it and threw it away in the sink and saw it was mercury at the bottom. ‘Her reaction was panic - she thought she had been poisoned. ‘She went straight to the hospital suffering stomach cramps, some stomach pain, but luckily no long term effects.' In the days before the incident Kaur had been disciplined for leaving a patient in a dental chair while she took her lunch break, the court was told. There had been several ‘disagreements with colleagues’ and the dental nurse had been involved in a tribunal two months before she allegedly spiked her boss’s drink. Laura Knowles was rushed to hospital with cramps. Kaur had twice been warned by bosses at Bedfordshire practice . Kaur, 35, allegedly spiked Laura Knowles' hot drink with the metal used to make fillings in an act of 'spite and revenge' Alleged incident: The alleged poisoning took place at the Shams Moopen Dental Practice in Shefford, Bedfordshire (pictured) ‘Ms Kaur turned up for work at 8.45am and offered to make everyone a cup of tea or coffee,’ said Ms Blackband. ‘Six people were on the premises at the time - two of them were Ms Kaur and Ms Knowles - and Ms Kaur went round asking if everyone wanted a cup. ‘Only Ms Knowles accepted - for a cup of coffee’. Kaur took a ‘very long time’ to make the drink and that when she returned she told workmates she had to change the water in the kettle, the court heard. After Ms Knowles took gulped down half of the coffee she ran to the sink in the staffroom and poured the remainder of the drink away. Jurors heard the liquid appeared to be much darker than coffee and also contained small pieces of metal. Ms Blackband said Kaur, who had worked at the practice since November 2011, was experienced in using mercury and knew of the potentially deadly effects if swallowed. Kaur from Bedford denies administering a noxious substance with intent to annoy, injure or aggrieve. The trial continues.

"By . Luke Garratt . A photographer has captured stunning aerial images of mountain-tops and sprawling deserts across Iran, India and Pakistan, that look like images of distant planets seen from space. Paul Williams, who is a director and producer for the BBC Natural History Unit, books window seats on airplanes especially for his hobby. The 34-year-old from Rotherham, who has worked on a range of TV series including 'Britain Goes Wild', 'Life in Cold Blood', 'Life' and 'How Earth Made Us', travelled around the region capturing aerial shots of deserts, mountains and even sweeping fires. BBC director and producer and part-time photographer Paul Williams has taken the stunning images of sprawling deserts across Iran, India and Pakistan - pictured is the Elberz Mountains in South Iran . Mr Williams said: 'I first read about the famous Salt Desert of Iran when I was a student 15 years ago, so when I realised that my recent flight back from Australia flew directly over this spectacular landscape I booked a window seat and hoped for a clear day.' He was not disappointed, and decided to explore the spectacular views beneath him. Around 300 kilometres east-southeast of Tehran lies Iran Dasht-e Kavir, also known as the Great Salt Desert. Mr Williams' remarkable photographs of the sprawling Salt Desert capture the beauty and detail of the landscape. Further images of the Elburz Mountains in South Iran - a massive mountain range stretching from Azerbaijan and Armenia stretching to the south Caspian sea . A view of an eroded salt dome in Kavir Desert, north Iran - the full name of which is Dasht-e Kavir, because of the nature of the material in the flats. 'Dasht' literally means 'salt' in Persian . A river winding its way through the mountains of south Pakistan, an area known for its appearances in local legend. Many highly religious people still make trips to the mountains for spiritual pilgrimages . Mr Williams didn't only take pictures of the uninhabited areas, also capturing built up areas like north west India, where smoke can be seen rising from fires in the area . 'Many of my images look like sliced onions or giant eyes, others look like racing tracks,' he said. 'From the air it is a mesmerising landscape of parallel and concentric lines which resemble the rings of Jupiter, on the ground it is one of the hottest and driest places on earth.' Most would assume that the Great Salt Desert has been bone-dry since the beginning of time. But experts believe that tens of millions of years ago a salt-rich ocean flowed through this area, surrounding a micro continent that is now central Iran. River channels at the foot of mountains in south west Pakistan - an area rife with new and emerging rivers and streams that flow across the mountain ranges . This image seems more like a vivid painting or image from another planet, but instead it shows the mountains of south west Pakistan meets the coast of the Arabian sea at Ormara Tehsil . An eroded salt dome in the Kavir Desert of north Iran - Mr Williams believes that he has uncovered new features of the area that have not been documented . An arial view of the eroded salt dome in the Kavir Desert in northern Iran - taken from directly above . Mr Williams explains that the evaporation of the ocean left behind a layer of salt up to 7 kilometres thick. Due to its low density as layers of younger rock buried the salt, it began to push upwards, shaping the younger rock into domes. Mr Williams said: 'Wind and rain continue to wear away the top of the domes to expose them in cross-section, like slicing an onion, to reveal geological works of art that are particularly striking when seen from the air.' He finds many interesting sights and objects within his photography and believes he stumbled across a mysterious base in the Salt Desert in Iran. In this image of the desert in Iran, a base can be seen in the topmost corner of the picture - Williams believes this base could be unmarked or lost, due to the fact that it does not appear on any official records or maps in areas with the same coordinates . This image of the Kavir Desert in Iran looks more like an image of the planet Jupiter seen through a telescope, showing how otherworldly some desert areas can look from above . The images of the Kavir Desert were taken over the course of many trips, and are part of Williams' hobby, which is booking trips on planes going over the desert and taking pictures out of the window . The photographer said: 'One of my photos shows a road going straight across the patterns and another (in the top left hand corner) shows some sort of base in the desert, possibly military. I've found most of the sites on Google Earth and I have GPS coordinates but I can't find this base anywhere.' He says he is certain, that based on the geology, rock markings, and the route of his plane that the coordinates on Google Maps are 34.935538, 54.436137. But Google Maps do not appear to show the base he uncovered in his photograph . The snow-covered mountains of southern Iran, where a small village on the sides of a major road snaking its way through the mountain pass can be seen on the right of the picture . Pail Williams, 34, has produced and directed many BBC travel documentaries and has been working on these images as a hobby for years - booking passage on planes in order to take his pictures . Mr Williams also travelled to South Iran to photograph the snow-coated Elburz Mountains. He captured a particularly striking photo with a clear line marking where the snow begins, and similarly to the Salt Desert, the magic of the Elburz Mountains lies in their exquisite detail. The white snow trickling down the dusty-pink mountain creates a pattern similar to the structure of veins. His aerial shots of the rocky, mountains in South Pakistan show exposed layers of an anticline and ancient folded rock formed by mountain building processes.","34-year-old Paul Williams is a producer for the BBC Natural History Unit, and takes the aerial pictures as a hobby .

"By . Harriet Arkell And Leon Watson . Murdered: Jane McRae, 55, died after her husband, Kenneth, 52, smashed a perfume bottle into her head in their home in Rowley Regis, West Midlands . This is the woman who was bludgeoned to death in bed by her husband before he killed himself over fears their home was blighted by Japanese knotweed. An inquest heard how nature-lover Jane McRae, 55, was battered by her husband Kenneth, 52, with a bottle of perfume as she lay in their bed, suffering fatal head injuries. In a suicide note, he said he killed his wife because the balance of his mind had been 'disturbed' by knotweed at their home in Rowley Regis, West Midlands. He wrote: 'I believe I was not an evil . man, until the balance of my mind was disturbed by the fact there is a . patch of Japanese knotweed which has been growing over our boundary . fence on the Rowley Regis Golf Course.' The doctor claimed golf course managers had been made aware of the problem but nothing had been done. After . trying to curb the weed's growth unsuccessfully, he said the risk of . structural damage and legal battles 'led to my growing madness.' He added: 'Jane and I were a very private couple, we chose to have no real friends, just enjoying each other. 'But the despair has got so bad that . today I have killed her, as I did not want her to be alone without an . income when I killed myself.' Today the couple's adopted son, photographer Mark McRae, said he did not know what drove his adoptive father to the crime. The 27-year-old told the Express and Star: 'The police told me about the note, but I spoke to a neighbour and knotweed has not been an issue noticed. I have also lived here since August, and it has not been a problem. 'I donâ€™t understand it, no-one understands it. They had a successful life, they had money â€“ something else could have been going on.' An . inquest at Smethwick Council house ruled Dr McRae, who worked at Solvay . chemicals plant three miles away in Langley, unlawfully killed his wife . before committing suicide. A police investigation found she may . have lain dead in bed on the second floor of the three-storey house for . up to a week. Dr McRae had been found with injuries on the first floor . of the home.

Neighbours also later claimed the area had suffered from knotweed before homes were built on the site. Mr . Balmain said: 'This is clearly a tragedy. They appeared for whatever . reason to keep themselves to themselves, they were perfectly entitled to . do that. 'The impression is Mr McRae was possibly becoming paranoid, there is no direct evidence of that of course.' He . had got a responsible job as a lab technician, his own home free from . mortgage. It appears he became obsessed with Japanese Knotweed in the . vicinity, which was not even on his property. Street: A neighbour of the McRaes in Rowley Regis said they were a 'reclusive but very devoted' couple . 'It . is perfectly clear he chose to kill his wife. It is difficult to . understand what was going on in Mr McRae's mind. For whatever reason he . killed his wife and then himself.' The . court heard the couple were estranged from their family and had not . even spoken to their adopted son, Mark McRae, for over a decade. Their . family declined to comment after the hearing. A neighbour of the McRaes' described the couple as 'reclusive but very devoted'. Avril Cowdell, 70, said: 'I have lived opposite them for years and I've never seen a visitor go into their house. 'They . were reclusive but seemed very devoted to each other.  Jane was very . friendly - she would cross the street to say hello to me if she saw me . out walking my dog, and was a lovely lady.' She said the only note of discord she noticed between the couple was that Mrs McRae loved the house and said she would never leave it, while she told neighbours her husband was worried about knotweed and wanted to sell up. 'He wanted to sell and she didn't,' she said.  'She said: ""I'll never move from here - I love it.""1 . Kenneth McRae, 52, battered his wife with a bottle of perfume as she lay in their bed, causing fatal head injuries . The neighbour continued: 'Jane said she had OCD [obsessive compulsive disorder], and was always out sweeping the front path, dusting and cleaning. 'Once she even repainted the whole house - she said she had to go to the doctor as she had repetitive strain injury from emulsioning every room.' Mrs Cowdell said that while Mrs McRae, whom she described as a nature lover, was originally from Birmingham, her husband came from Scotland, and the couple frequently went there for weekends away. She added: 'I never saw them arguing.  They seemed very happy, although the husband would never say hello to me or anyone else.' She said they had adopted a son, who is now a photographer, when he was around three, and he lived with them until he was about 17, and their relationship apparently cooled. Mrs McRae had a keen in interest in the environment, the neighbour said, while her husband, who had a PhD in a science discipline, worked night shifts at a local laboratory and often had trouble catching up on his sleep during the day.  She also said he was a keen runner, going out for up to one and a half hours at a time.","Kenneth McRae, 52, battered partner Jane, 55, as she lay in their bed .

"By . Hugo Gye . An architect stabbed his wife to death before blowing up his own house, killing himself and his mother-in-law, an inquest heard yesterday. A few days earlier, Hassan Rafie had warned his wife Mahnaz: 'You leave me, I will kill you and kill myself - if I can't have you no one else can.' He then tampered with a gas meter in order to trigger an explosion and fire which killed his mother-in-law Dolleh Mohanaei, who was in an upstairs bedroom at the couple's house in Bolton, Greater Manchester. Home: Hassan Rafie killed his wife Mahnaz and her mother at the couple's home in Bolton, pictured . Family: The couple's sons Ommid, left, and Arash, right, were praised by the coroner at the inquest . Firefighters found the body of Mrs Rafie, 48, lying next to that of her husband, 49, in the kitchen of their home as gas leaked from the meter on December 9 last year. Mrs Mohanaei, 74, who had been staying with the couple while awaiting treatment for lung cancer, was found collapsed and was taken to hospital, where she was later pronounced dead. Bolton Coroners Court heard that Mrs Rafie died from four stab wounds to the chest, consistent with a serrated 17cm bladed hunting knife that was found in the kitchen, while Mr Rafie and Mrs Monahaei both died from burns and smoke inhalation. The couple, who were originally from Iran, were due to celebrate their silver wedding anniversary, and had two sons - Ommid, a newly qualified doctor, and medical student Arash. However, the inquest was told that the couple's marriage had broken down and Mr Rafie became 'controlling', checking his wife's phone. Fire: Mr Rafie caused an explosion by starting a gas leak, killing himself and his mother-in-law . In a . WhatsApp message to a friend two days before her death, Mrs Rafie wrote: . 'Hassan kept crying so I left him to it. I had to tell him that me and . him are finished. He kept telling me to stay.' The . friend added that Mr Rafie had been speaking to his mother-in-law to . try and save his marriage, and had told his wife: 'If I can't have you, . no one else can'. Another . friend told the police that Mrs Rafie had told her over the phone that . her husband had said: 'You leave me, I will kill you and kill myself.' A . forensic pathologist told the inquest that Mrs Rafie suffered injuries . inflicted with 'significant force', with two stab wounds penetrating her . lung, one 12cm deep between her ribs and another penetrating through . her liver. The . inquest heard evidence that a trail of petrol was found on the floor, . while the charred remains of a petrol can and a cigarette lighter were . also recovered. Duncan . Thorpe if Greater Manchester Police said: 'We didn't find any evidence . of any third-party involvement. It became apparent from speaking to a . number of friends and family, the relationship between Mahnaz and Hassan . had deteriorated. 'From . a diary we read, what it appeared was that going back as far as 2010, . there were some problems within the marriage. Mr Rafie's own father had . died, he was dealing with an inheritance claim over in Iran. 'He . was out of the country for some considerable time, it may have put . pressure on the relationship. We have spoke to two main witnesses who . were friends with Mrs Rafie and they gave further information into the . state of the relationship. 'What . came out was Mr Rafie was quite controlling with Mrs Rafie, he would . monitor her when on the phone, check her phone for texts. That was the . picture that came out to us, culminated with a number of texts leading . up to December 9.' Break-up: The couple had been married for nearly 25 years but their relationship was apparently troubled . He added that the investigation also found indications that she had been trying to get in touch with a solicitor with a view to getting a divorce. Mr Thorpe said he believed Mr Rafie - who had recently bought diesel, petrol and two petrol cans - was to blame for the tragedy. The couple's son Ommid insisted it would have been possible for a intruder to break in and subsequently leave the house, even though the doors were locked from the inside, and added that his father needed the fuel to restore his garden. Dr Rafie said: 'Having been given back the laptop, I think there is significant information which shows reflections of my father's mental state. 'My point is, my dad had multiple searches, cancer trials, he had been looking at funeral arrangements. I think that's significant, that he was in a normal frame of mind. 'He had emailed his dentist about gum treatment. He was addressing his affairs. The summary I take away from it was normal, someone forward planning and looking into future decisions at that time.' But Gary Jarvis, of Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, dismissed the suggestion that a third party could have been involved. 'If someone had done that they would never had time to shut and lock the door, there would have been an explosion,' he said. 'It would have been impossible to leave. Someone in the kitchen produced a naked flame to ignite the vapours.' Coroner Jennifer Leeming ruled that Mrs Rafie and her mother were unlawfully killed, whilst an open verdict was recorded into the death of Mr Rafie. She told the family: 'I have been more than impressed by the courage and dignity shown by yourself and your family. It is not easy coming to an inquest and this has been one of the hardest ones. 'You have approached these proceedings as a family with the utmost courage and dignity.'","Hassan Rafie threatened wife Mahnaz in bid to stop break-up of marriage .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . FCA chief executive Martin Wheatley said firms offering loans to people who can never afford to repay their debts must 'improve their standards or leave the industry' The financial industry ‘lost its moral compass’, the head of the new City watchdog said today as he warned payday lenders to clean up their act or face being shut down. The Financial Conduct Authority suggested a quarter of payday lenders could be put out of business as it took charge of the £200 billion consumer credit market. Chief executive Martin Wheatley said firms offering loans to people who can never afford to repay their debts must ‘improve their standards or leave the industry’. Citizens Advice today warned that a payday loan has become a ‘debt sentence’ for many trapped by irresponsible lenders. Under the new rules payday lenders will be banned from making repeated raids on customers’ bank accounts to fund their debts. Compulsory checks will also have to be carried out to make sure people can afford to repay loans before they are offered. Mr Wheatley told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘Our concern has been that parts of this industry, not all, loan without doing any affordability checks and then loading costs onto people who simply cannot pay, and that's the part of the industry that we really want to take out, we want them to improve their standards or leave the industry. ‘We've said that up to a quarter could leave, I think the industry itself has estimated figures much higher than that, we'll have to see. ‘We'd like firms to rise to our standards, but if they can't then we'd like them to leave the industry, it's very straightforward.’ Payday lenders will also have to provide financial health warnings online and link to free debt help from today. And the FCA is to consult on capping the total cost of a loan, to stop charges spiralling out of control. Under the plans, a payday loan firm will be able to attempt to try raid a borrower's account using a recurring payment known as a continuous payment authority (CPA) twice. In future payday lenders will have to provide financial health warnings online and link to free debt help . Mr Wheatley defended the decision not to scrap the powers altogether, insisting payday lenders offer a service used by hundreds of thousands of people. ‘The difficulty with this industry is that consumers in the UK use this product, it's not a question that it's a complete rip off, people use it and have valid reasons for wanting short-term access to money. Martin Wheatley, FCA . ‘Over Christmas, the Money Advice figures said a million people planned to access these sort of services, so one of the difficult questions for us is how we balance the fact that some people use and value this service against the fact that some people are abusing the delivery of it.’ He insisted that the FCA had a ‘proportionate and balanced response’. But Citizens Advice warned lenders have not kept promises to freeze interest rates, warn about the cost of extending loans and offer free debt advice to customers struggling to repay their debts. Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said: ‘A payday loan has become a debt sentence for many of our clients due to irresponsible practices by lenders. ‘Consumers who are looking for a bit of money to tide them over need a fair and competitive market to engage with not one that seeks to exploit them. ‘The stern warning and tough rules from the FCA need to be followed with strong enforcement action.  Lenders found to breaking the rules and harming consumers should be immediately thrown out of the market.’","Financial Conduct Authority oversees £200billion consumer credit market .

"By . Luke Garratt . A bride who was kidnapped and forced to marry an older man eventually escaped captivity, and after finding true love after 35 years, decided to celebrate by permanently wearing her wedding dress, and has done so for the last ten years. Xiang Junfeng, 47, from Jimo in the Shandong province of China, is otherwise known as 'sister wedding gowns' by locals because of her tendency to wear her wedding gowns all year round. When she was 18, Mrs Junfeng was kidnapped from her hometown and sold to a remote village to be the wife of an elderly man, but after 15 years in captivity, she found the courage to run away. Xiang Junfeng wears one of her four wedding gowns all year round, and has done for the last 10 years, regardless of whether she is at home or outside doing farm work . She was originally sold to a man in . Linyi, in China's Shandong province, but she claims the man almost used . her like a slave, forcing her to work in the fields. She later escaped, running to a village in Liujiazhuang village in Jimo city in Shandong province were she was helped by a local woman. This woman eventually introduced Mrs Junfeng to her brother, Zhu Zhengliang, who she married in 2004. Before the big day she bought one dress, and later made three others, so she could rotate them and always be wearing one for each of the four seasons. She said: 'I bought one and made the other three.' Mrs Junfeng has four wedding dresses, one of which she bought and the rest of which she made, so she would have one for each season . Mrs Junfeng was kidnapped when she was 20 and made to marry an older man, later being made to work in the fields as a labourer for her 'abusive' husband, and claims she was treated more like a prisoner than a wife . After she met and married her husband, he helped rehabilitate her to everyday life. She said: 'I had only ever known a violent and abusive man and I avoided men until I . met my new partner who brought me truly out of my shell, and treated me . so differently. 'I couldn’t believe it when he asked me to marry him. 'My . wedding day was the happiest day of my life and I never wanted it to . end, and that was when I decided I wanted to not only keep wearing my . wedding dress, but actually bought four other wedding dresses as well. 'We . felt comfortable with each other, so we have been together since then. I . am very happy now, as my husband is very good to me.' Mrs Junfeng claims the only thing that upsets her is that she can't officially register her new marriage because her details are lost from when she was kidnapped - but the police have pledged to help her with the situation . The only thing that upsets Xiang is that she can't register her marriage . officially because she doesn't have the correct paperwork because of . her first marriage. However, the local police station said they are . thinking of helping Xiang become registered. She said that locals regarded her as strange because of her obsession . with the wedding dresses especially when she is working in the fields . but added: 'I don’t even have any other clothes. But she said the main thing was that it didn’t disturb her husband, who knew that it made her happy . She said: 'I don’t care what . people say about me. My wedding dresses are part of my life and I will . continue to wear them regardless.' While sometimes faced with strange looks because of her bizarre dress sense, she says she doesn't care as long as her husband doesn't mind, because it makes her happy .","Xiang Junfeng, 47, from Jimo, China, was kidnapped at the age of 18 .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Selfies have become ubiquitous over the past few years, with everyone from pop stars to the president of the United States jumping on the bandwagon - but turns out the photo craze is at least a century old. Writer and photograph Tom Byron has shared with the Internet community a handful of 'selfies' taken by his great-grandfather dating back to 1909. Responding to a question about the best selfis on the social media site Quora late last month, Byron posted a trio of sepia-tone snapshots from the turn of the last century showing his ancestor, Joseph Byron Clayton, posing alone and with a group of friends while holding a bulky camera in his hands. World's greatest selfie: Photographer and writer Tom Byron shared this 'selfie' his great-grandfather, Joseph Byron Clayton, took back in 1909 . Group photo: Byron Clayotn's century-old self-portraits depicting him and his impeccably dressed mustached friends, look slightly distorted, like reflections in a fun-house mirror . Unlike today's compact smartphones and slender tablets, taking a selfie a hundred years ago was a complicated task that required the photographer to hold a large, boxy apparatus in front of him. The resulting images appeared disordered and out of proportion, similar to a reflection in a fun-house mirror. In the prints aged by time, Mr Byron Clayton, a bespectacled, moustachioed gentleman, is depicted smiling for the camera in his hand alongside his friends all dressed in impeccable suits and bowler hats, with a fedora or two thrown in the mix. Mr Byron, a retiree from Marietta, Georgia, explained on Quora that he comes from a long line of shutterbugs beginning with his great-great-grandfather, James Clayton, who opened his first photo studio in London in mid-1800s. The history of the Byron family as it is laid out on Ancestry.com is a fascinating one. Born in 1802 in Nottingham, England, James Clayton started out as a small-time businessman running a successful basket making company with his wife. No iPhone? No problem: Taking a selfie a hundred years ago, with no smartphone or tablet in sight, was a complicated task that required the photographer to hold a boxy apparatus in front of him . Around 1857, he decided to open his first photography studio, possibly inspired by his younger brother, Walter, who got into the picture-taking business a year before. When his son, Joseph Byron Clayton, was in his teens in the early 1860s, he joined his father as a studio assistant. But a few years later, Joseph took a job with a London photographer by the name of Sanderson and later bought him out. In the late 1860s, the budding entrepreneur was convicted of receiving stolen goods and sentenced to 12 months of hard labor. Shutterbugs: Tom Byron comes from a long line of photographers, beginning with his great-great-grandfather, James Byron, who opened a studio in 1857 in England; these are some of the business cards used by his ancestors over the years . Once freed, Byron Clayton resumed his career in photography and married a coal miner's daughter named Julia Lewin, who bore him six children. By mid 1880s, Byron Claytonâ€™s company had fallen on hard times. Facing a possible bankruptcy, the businessman, his wife and oldest daughter picked up and immigrated to New York in hopes of a fresh start. For a year Byron Clayton practiced as a freelance press photographer for the Illustrated American, among other publications, before breaking into stage photography. His son Percy followed in his footsteps, but eventually moved to Edmonton, Canada, where he established a photographic business with his brother-in-law. Family trait: Tom Byron seemingly inherited from his great-grandfather not only a passion for photography, but also a penchant for facial hair . Life well lived: Byron, pictured here with his wife of 27 years, earned multiple college degrees and went on to a successful career in photography before retiring in 2010 . The family business faltered during World War I, forcing Percy to move back to New York, where he again joined forces with his father, establishing a studio specializing in ship photography. Joseph Byron Clayton died in 1923, after which Percy Byron took over the Byron Company and continued to run it successfully until the middle of World War II, when business experienced a downturn and the company closed for good in October 1942. Tom Byron, a married father of three, who earned several college degrees in economics, followed in his ancestorsâ€™ footsteps, working as a photographer until 2010, when he retired.","Tom Byron shared on Quora three 'selfies' his great-grandfather James Byron Clayton took in 1909 .

"By . Suzannah Hills . CCTV: This 13-year-old teenager slapped a 52-year-old female fishmonger around the face with a sea bream . A 13-year-old girl who slapped a fishmonger in the face with a large sea bream has been let go by police after she apologised. The teenager was captured smiling on CCTV moments before the bizarre fish-slapping incident at an Asda store in Accrington, Lancashire, in February. Police officers released the the camera footage in the hopes of tracing the person responsible and the attacker has now been identified as a 13-year-old girl. But Lancashire Police today admitted the girl has been let go with a slap on the wrist after she wrote a letter of apology to the 52-year-old staff member. In a statement Lancashire police said: 'Following the appeal that we released, a 13-year-old girl has been spoken to by officers and has taken part in a community resolution whereby she has sent the victim a letter of apology. 'The matter has therefore been resolved and is now closed. There will be no more police involvement.' The 52-year-old victim was working on the Asda fish counter when the teenager approached her stall and asked about what was for sale. Without warning, the girl suddenly picked up a bream which was on ice and slapped the shocked worker with it before running out of the store. The victim believes the incident was being filmed on a mobile phone by a man stood nearby who also ran from the scene when challenged. Scene: Police let the teenager off after she wrote a letter of apology to the victim of the attack at Asda store in Accrington, Lancashire . The attacker was initially described as being Irish and aged between 15 and 18 with blonde, shoulder-length untidy hair. Police described the prank as 'completely unacceptable'. The incident is an odd echo of . sketches by Monty Python's Flying Circus - one of which featured a man . in military uniform dancing on a canal towpath while slapping another . man with a fish. His fun . is brought to an abrupt halt when the second man pulls out an enormous . specimen and uses it to hit his aggressor around the head, knocking him . into the water. Fish and hits: The woman was hit in the face with a bream, which can grow to 40cm long (file photo) The incident also has more serious echoes of 'happy slapping', a craze which took hold for a few years in the early 2000s when mobile phones were first equipped with video cameras. Mostly performed by teenagers, the pranks involved slapping or hitting someone while being filmed and then uploading the footage to the internet. Some took the prank too far and in 2008 a 15-year-old girl, who was too young to be named, was sentenced to a two-year detention and training order after filming an attack on 29-year-old victim Gavin Waterhouse, who later died. No laughing matter: The incident is reminiscent of the fish slapping dance in a sketch by Monty Python .","Shocked female victim, 52, was working behind an Asda fish counter .

"By . Nick Pisa . An Italian newspaper owned by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi has caused controversy by printing a front page headline which said 'Fourth Reich' above a picture of German chancellor Angela Merkel. The picture in newspaper Il Giornale also showed Chancellor Merkel raising her right arm in salute, a gesture associated with the Nazi salute used by Hitler's followers. The article, which was published on Friday, has heightened a bitter war of words between Italy and Germany over the handling of the ongoing Euro crisis. War of words: An Italian newspaper owned by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi has caused controversy by printing a front page headline which said 'Fourth Reich' above a picture of German chancellor Angela Merkel . The angry article attacked tough talking Chancellor Merkel saying that her intransigence had brought 'us and Europe to its knees' adding that 'Italy is no longer in Europe but in the Fourth Reich.' It went on to say: 'In the First Reich, Germany also wanted the title Emperor of Rome and in the next two they used their own means again against the states of Europe, two world wars and millions of dead, obviously this was not enough to quieten German egomania. 'Once again it has surfaced but this time not with the use of cannon, this time it's the Euro. 'The Germans believe it's theirs and we have to submit, surrender, hand ourselves over to the new Kaiser Angela Merkel who wants to rule in our own house.' It is not the first time that Il Giornale has been at the centre of controversy with Germany - two months ago after Italy beat Germany in the Euro 2012 semi final they printed a picture of Chancellor Merkel below the headline: 'Ciao, ciao culona' which translates as 'Bye bye lard arse.' Last year it was alleged that . Berlusconi, who stepped down as prime minister last November, had been . taped calling the German leader 'culona' although he has insisted they . had a good working relationship and are still in touch - claims which . have been denied in Berlin. The picture in newspaper Il Giornale - owned by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi , left, also showed Chancellor Merkel, right, raising her right arm in salute, a gesture associated with Hitler's followers . Germany has been at loggerheads with Italy over the handling of the ongoing Eurozone crisis and accusing Rome of not doing enough to get its finances in order to resolve the single currency problem which has been dragging on for two years. Newspapers in Germany have repeatedly attacked the southern European economies of Greece, Spain and Italy for their poor performances and bail outs offered to them. Il Giornale has repeatedly accused current Italian technocrat prime minister Mario Monti, of not doing enough to stand up to Germany, comparing him to Neville Chamberlain who famously declared in 1938 he had 'secured peace in our time' after holding talks with Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler only for war to break out the following year. Criticism: Il Giornale has repeatedly accused current Italian technocrat prime minister Mario Monti, pictured, of not doing enough to stand up to Germany . In an interview with Germany weekly news magazine Der Spiegel, Monti called on Chancellor Merkel to show greater flexibility on how the European Union tackles the eurozone crisis and suggested there could be a backlash if this does not occur. Chancellor Merkel has repeatedly argued that the only way to restore confidence in the under-fire single currency in the long term is for eurozone countries to show budget discipline and concede sovereignty to achieve greater fiscal integration. But Monti said that 'more flexibility' had to be given to eurozone countries who are trying to put their economic houses in order for Italy's current policy of rigour and tough economic reforms to 'have a future'. He added that he had told Chancellor Merkel he was very worried about 'the growing resentment in the Italian parliament against Europe, against the euro and against the Germans'. Monti also added that leaders should not let themselves be tied down by the domestic agendas of their national parliaments in EU negotiations and said: 'If governments let themselves be bound completely by the decisions of their parliaments without maintaining their own scope for negotiation, Europe is more likely to break up than it is to see closer integration.' But within hours of the interview Chancellor Merkel and German MPs hit back at Monti. Georg Streiter, a spokesman for the German leader, said: 'The chancellor's opinion is that we in Germany have always done well with the right balance between parliamentary support and the participation of parliament.'
