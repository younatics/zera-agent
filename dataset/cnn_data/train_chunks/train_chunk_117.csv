"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel declared a Friday test of its Arrow weapon system a ""major milestone"" in the development of a system to defend against medium range missiles that could be fired from countries like Iran. In a statement the Israeli Defense Ministry said the test ""provides confidence in operational Israeli capabilities to defeat the developing ballistic missile threat."" The successful test of the joint American and Israeli weapon system was held over the Mediterranean Sea Friday morning and sought to track a simulated incoming ballistic missile via radar and pass the information back to what is known as the battle management controller. The Defense Ministry described the test as a ""target-only tracking exercise,"" meaning the missile was not intercepted. The ministry said the test demonstrated that the Arrow Weapon System and the U.S. Ballistic Missile Defense System could successfully work together in what it termed ""interoperability."" U.S. Missile Defense Agency personnel participated in the test, the ministry said. The missile defense test comes amid fevered speculation that Israel may soon launch a unilateral attack against Iran's nuclear program, though Israeli defense officials said the timing of Friday's exercise were planned a year in advance and was not connected to recent events. Both countries were supposed to hold a massive joint missile defense exercise in April, but the drills were postponed until the second half of the year with both sides citing technical reasons. Israel and the United States have been jointly developing the multi-billion dollar Arrow missile defense system since 1986. The goal of the project is to provide Israel with a defense for medium range missiles fired toward it from the region.","Israel declares test a ""major milestone"" in development of anti-missile system .

"(CNN) -- Syrian security forces have summarily executed at least 101 people, including civilians, since late 2011 in attacks on cities and towns, Human Rights Watch said in a report released Monday. The report ""documents the involvement of Syrian forces and pro-government shabeeha militias in summary and extrajudicial executions of defecting soldiers, opposition fighters and opposition supporters, as well as civilians who appeared to have had no part in the confrontation with the authorities other than being residents of opposition strongholds,"" according to the human rights organization. The 25-page report, ""In Cold Blood: Summary Executions by Syrian Security Forces and Pro-Goverment Militias,"" was based on more than 30 interviews with witnesses to the executions, Human Rights Watch said. While it was not possible to verify the exact numbers of victims of such executions, the organization said it had documented 12 cases in Idlib and Homs governorates involving at least 101 victims since December 2011. Human Rights Watch said it had received reports of other incidents, but only included in its report incidents where eyewitnesses were interviewed. ""At least 85 victims were described by witnesses as residents who did not take part in the fighting, including women and children,"" the report said. ""In a desperate attempt to crush the uprising, Syrian forces have executed people in cold blood, civilians and opposition fighters alike,"" said Ole Solvang, emergencies researcher at Human Rights Watch. ""They are doing it in broad daylight and in front of witnesses, evidently not concerned about any accountability for their crimes."" International human rights law ""unequivocally prohibits summary and extrajudicial executions,"" the organization said. Many of the reported executions took place last month. On March 11 and 12, for instance, 47 people -- mostly women and children -- were killed in three neighborhoods in the city of Homs, the report said. Also March 11, 13 men were killed at the Bilal mosque in Idlib, according to Human Rights Watch. And on March 3, 25 men were executed during a search and arrest operation in the Sultaniya neighborhood in the city of Homs. ""In these cases, Syrian security forces, operating alone or together with pro-government shabeeha militias, captured and executed people who were trying to escape as the army took over their towns, shot or stabbed people in their homes as they entered the captured towns, or executed detained residents while conducting house searches,"" the report said. One resident of Homs' hard-hit Baba Amr neighborhood, identified in the report as ""Louai,"" a pseudonym, reported his brother and four of his neighbors were executed on March 2. The army first entered his neighbors' house, he said, dragged the four men outside, and killed them with knives in front of their families. The soldiers then entered Louai's house and shot at him and his brother as they raised their hands, he reported. Louai was injured and his brother was killed. In addition, at least 16 opposition fighters were shot at point-blank range by Syrian forces after they had been captured or wounded. The report raises ""concerns that the army had adopted a policy, official or unofficial, of executing opposition fighters,"" Human Rights Watch said. In one case in Idlib governorate, an opposition fighter, his leg injured by machine-gun fire, ""was lying on the street and we could not rescue him, as the army was firing and shooting at our position,"" a second fighter told Human Rights Watch. ""He was twisting with pain and couldn't escape. ""Then a tank approached; around 15 soldiers in military uniforms surrounded our comrade and started insulting him and kicking him,"" the anonymous fighter said. ""They were shouting to us that we should surrender or they would kill him. Then they put a black cloth around his eyes, handcuffed him and one of them finished him with an (assault rifle). When they left, we buried him in the graveyard in the village."" Other witnesses reported finding bodies that appeared to have been sexually violated, and some said they had heard accounts of women being raped in towns taken under the army's control, according to the report. The organization called on the United Nations Security Council ""to ensure that any UN mission mandated to supervise the six-point plan brokered by the UN-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan would be in a position to document such crimes."" The Security Council should refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court, Human Rights Watch said. It appeared doubtful Monday whether the Syrian government would follow through on its pledge to withdraw troops from cities nationwide. The Syrian Foreign Ministry said Sunday it would not commit to pulling forces only to have ""armed terrorist groups"" attack. The Syrian government has consistently blamed violence in the country on ""armed terrorist groups."" But U.N. and other world leaders have said the government is lethally cracking down on dissidents seeking true democracy and an ouster of President Bashar al-Assad, whose family has ruled Syria for 42 years.","The Human Rights Watch report is based on interviews with eyewitnesses .

"(CNN) -- A TV series' 100th episode signifies success and, in most cases, a profitable afterlife in syndication. Shows like ""Seinfeld"" and ""Friends"" coasted past their centenary episodes, leaving fans wanting more. But it's not just ratings juggernauts that reach the milestone. Sometimes networks and viewers just don't know when to let go. ""Gossip Girl's"" climactic 100th episode aired on Monday, reminding dedicated fans why they've held on for so long, and, by the same token, alerting former viewers of the show's protracted life. ""They can trot out a cake with 100 candles on it, but let's be honest, ('Gossip Girl's') ratings have been terrible for years,"" said Matt Whitfield, the features editor at Yahoo. The CW drama hasn't attracted more than 1.5 million viewers during its Monday night timeslot since the fifth season kicked off in September. During its first season, which premiered in 2007, episodes of ""Gossip Girl"" routinely garnered more than 2 million viewers -- a feat for the younger-skewing network. And despite disappointing ratings, ""Gossip Girl"" executive producer Stephanie Savage told The Hollywood Reporter that they're not writing a series finale anytime soon. ""The actors' contracts expire at the end of next season, so that feels like probably an organic ending point,"" Savage said. If budding movie stars Blake Lively and Leighton Meester can't deliver ratings, there's a problem, Whitfield said. Perhaps it's because the series, based on Cecily von Ziegesar's novels of the same name, isn't playing hard to get. ""Gossip Girl"" doesn't need 24 episodes each season, Whitfield said. Networks can learn from the model employed by HBO's ""Game of Thrones"" and AMC's ""The Walking Dead,"" he added. They need to minimize the number of episodes airing each season. ""Some shows only need to last three seasons,"" he said. ""And some shows only need to have 10 episodes per season. Users can handle that, but the networks can't."" The show's creator, Josh Schwartz, has taken heat for this in the past. His Fox drama ""The O.C."" lasted four seasons -- just short of the 100-episode mark -- before getting canceled in 2007. Many viewers have argued that ""The O.C.'s"" jumping point occurred when Mischa Barton's character was killed off at the end of season 3. Of course, it's easy for a high quality show that's won a ton of awards, like ""The Sopranos,"" to go out on top, Whitfield said, adding, ""Other shows on network TV will try and wring out every dollar ... they possibly can. It's always happened that way."" Take, for example, ABC's ""Desperate Housewives"" and ""House"" on Fox, he said. At one point, both shows dominated ratings and awards shows. Now, with both programs currently in the midst of their eighth seasons, viewership has greatly diminished. After hitting a ratings rough patch last season, ABC's ""Grey's Anatomy,"" on the other hand, is currently experiencing a resurgence in its eighth season. Many primetime soaps experience hills and valleys, Whitfield said. Unfortunately for ""Gossip Girl,"" the next hill might be out of reach. ""To wait five seasons before marrying Blair off and announcing who Gossip Girl is, you've missed the boat,"" he said. ""They were starting to throw in these gimmicks too late in the game."" But The CW, Schwartz and Savage have another trick up their sleeves. They're working to bring ""Sex and the City"" prequel ""The Carrie Diaries"" to the small screen. Whitfield says only the really great shows will make it to syndication and last there. ""Will and Grace"" and ""Law and Order: Special Victims Unit,"" he said, ""will forever be in syndication because people still tune into them."" A show like ""Gossip Girl,"" he added -- not so much. ""There are too many options on TV. ... And with people flipping around the Internet ... Ratings have been dropping across the board,"" he said. ""There are shiny, bright new things out there to try.""","""Seinfeld"" and ""Friends"" coasted past 100 episodes, leaving fans wanting more .

"(CNN) -- For years it has been dominated by women, but now luxury fashion is kicking off its high heels and slipping into something more masculine as it strides through the economic downturn. The market for male fashion is growing twice as fast as that for women, according to Antoine Arnault, son of one of Europe's richest men and board member of luxury group LVMH. The uptick in male customers is credited with keeping the industry buoyant while Europe slides toward recession. Last year menswear spending grew 14% globally, according to consultancy firm Bain & Company. ""The luxury industry has always been a little bit counter-cyclical,"" Arnault says. ""There's no real strategy behind it, I just feel it's a time where quality and craft is of the utmost importance."" Arnault heads up luxury fashion label Berluti -- part of the LVMH group which includes brands such as Louis Vuitton and Moet & Chandon -- and has overseen its recent expansion into menswear. Berluti is targeting the top end of the market, with shoes that can take their craftsman in Italy about 20 hours to make. Arnault describes the ""Berluti man"" as ""one and unique. First of all, he travels a lot. He can be Chinese, but he often comes to Paris, he often goes to New York. It is global."" Being part of LVMH's empire gives Berluti financial support and the backing of experienced hands, Arnault says. ""LVMH senior management come to see us very often to see how things are evolving, see what we're developing and to give us advice,"" he says. This nurturing environment will ensure a long future for the brand, according to Arnault. ""Think about at Microsoft and Apple, they are the most important brands today, are you sure that in 100 years these companies will still exist? You can't be sure of that,"" he says. ""Our brands, Louis Vuitton, Krug, Dom Perignon... Berluti will almost for sure still exist in 100 years, and that's thanks to the fact that we're all together and we're nourishing each other's positive sides,"" he adds.

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI arrived in Cuba's southeastern city of Santiago de Cuba on Monday, delivering Mass before throngs of Cubans in only the second papal visit in the island's history. He was greeted upon his arrival by Cuban President Raul Castro and the nation's clergy, including Cuban Cardinal Jaime Ortega. With a red carpet rolled out to meet the pope's airplane, Castro walked beside the pontiff to a pair of large wooden chairs. A brass band played Cuba's national anthem and other tunes as they stood together, while artillery rounds were fired off nearby in celebration. Benedict told the audience that he seeks to emphasize ""the importance of faith,"" highlighting the need for good relations between the church and the Marxist state. Castro welcomed Benedict, saying his country has endeavored for peace and justice, but noted that even ""14 years after John Paul's visit,"" the U.S. economic embargo against Cuba persists. Clad all in white, Benedict walked with Castro, who was dressed in a dark suit, and greeted other state officials and clergy. Crowds of flag-waving Cubans lined the street on which Benedict's motorcade traveled, as Cuban state television captured both ground and aerial footage of the trip. Later Monday evening, Benedict delivered Mass in the city's square, drawing huge crowds as legions of musicians playing wind and string instruments performed during pauses in his sermon, supported by what appeared to be concert-grade sound systems. The visit marks the next-to-last leg of a two-country tour the pope has used to both spread the Catholic faith and address political issues in the region. His first stop was in Mexico, where he denounced violence in that country brought by the ongoing drug wars. Benedict also blasted Cuba's Marxist political system Friday, saying it ""no longer corresponds to reality."" The pope's comment, delivered to reporters aboard a flight from Rome to Mexico, sparked widespread speculation as to what he would say when he addresses the Cuban people directly. The island nation's foreign minister, Bruno Rodriguez, responding to the comment, said his government considers ""the exchange of ideas useful"" and is still perfecting its system. The pope is scheduled to meet again with Castro and Ortega in Havana, along with the president's family, which could include Fidel Castro, who stepped down from power in 2006 after battling illness. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez also arrived on the island Saturday, according to Cuban state television, which reported he is there to undergo further radiation treatment for cancer. It is not clear whether Benedict will meet Chavez. Benedict, 84, is due to fly to the Cuban capital on Tuesday, and preside over a Mass in Havana's Revolution Plaza on the following day. Large crowds are expected. Preparations for the visit have included fresh coats of paint splashed across buildings and posters announcing the pope's arrival tacked on city structures. The trip is timed to the 400th anniversary of Our Lady of Charity, Cuba's patron saint, but uncertainty looms over what will be said, with whom the pope will meet and what the visit will mean for Cubans. ""For me, I'm very happy he's coming,"" said Juana DeArmas, a shopkeeper in the capital's Old Havana neighborhood. ""I was here when (Pope) John Paul came, and there were always plenty of tourists that followed."" The visit is seen as a possible tourism boost to the island's cash-strapped economy as many residents seek to make use of a series of recent free market reforms that have slowly swelled the number of private businesses in the country. Fourteen years earlier, a much different Fidel Castro greeted a much different pontiff when thousands were introduced to Pope John Paul II, who made the historic first papal trip to Cuba in 1998. Having been invited by then-President Fidel Castro, John Paul famously urged the country ""to open to the world, and the world to open to Cuba."" ""There was a kind of love affair between John Paul and Latin America,"" said CNN Senior Vatican Analyst John Allen. ""It just isn't the same with Pope Benedict."" In Mexico, an archbishop called on worshippers to stop making comparisons between Benedict and the former pope, who drew massive crowds across Latin America and visited every country in the region before he died in 2005. In Cuba, though John Paul helped warm church-government relations, the nation's ties with religion have remained complicated. Decades earlier, Castro's Communist revolution sought to stamp out religious influence in Cuba, confiscating church property and expelling religious workers, some of whom had supported anti-Castro forces. The country was officially atheist until the 1990s, when the constitution was amended and references to atheism were replaced with secularism. Christmas was recognized as a holiday at that time and Communist Party members were permitted to openly practice their faith, if they had one. Church officials now say the island is about 60% Catholic, though few openly practice. Still, religious access to state television and the administering of religious schools remain largely restricted, which could be a point of emphasis during the pontiff's trip, observers say. ""These papal visits can have an impact,"" Allen said. ""They can kind of jar things lose. And it seems that under Raul, Cuba is taking baby steps toward normalization."" But many on the island seem skeptical that the trip will yield lasting results. While the country's Roman Catholic Church has often been lauded for its role in recent reforms, it has also received heavy criticism for appearing too cozy with the government. Rights group say the nation has largely emptied its jails of political prisoners, and yet it continues to harass the country's activists.","NEW: Pope Benedict XVI delivers mass in Santiago de Cuba .

"CareerBuilder.com) -- Jobs offering work-from-home options and flexible hours are sought by workers ranging from parents who want to be there when the kids get home from school to employees tired of daily commutes. But what types of occupations offer this type of arrangement? More fields than you may think. Below, meet all kinds of people who are living outside the 9-to-5 cubicle. Communications . While authors up all night to get their vision into words have been around for ages, computers and mobile phones have opened up that lifestyle to others. Copywriters, editors, researchers, translators and even public relations directors can use their laptops and cell phones to work virtually anywhere at any time. Technology has created new communications positions, too. Lisa Gordon of Needham, Massachusetts, is co-founder of Catcher in the Sky, a business that develops applications for the iPhone. ""Both my partner and I are moms of elementary-school-aged children, so flexibility is a must,"" Gordon says. ""I have chosen to work for myself and to be accountable only to my partner. We drive each other to do our best and are also understanding of family needs that arise."" James Larson works as a social media assistant for The Corporate Educator, a company in Wallingford, Connecticut. ""Essentially, my position is to maximize the presence of our business on various media outlets,"" Larson says. ""I respond to blogs, interact with customers and am even beginning to develop sales leads as well."" Sales . Speaking of sales, this field has a wealth of potentially flexible positions: telemarketers, Avon ladies, eBay shop owners, real estate agents and insurance company representatives, to name a few. ""I manage the domestic and international sales for a lumber manufacturing company headquartered in Charlottesville, Virginia"" says Bo Hammond, a vice president with Coastal Lumber Co. ""With technology, remote access and smart phones, my hours are flexible. Work from home is accepted. The motivation is to get the job done. For my specific job, that is being accessible, whether in the office or remotely."" Support services . Getting things done is the bottom line for many companies, so typists, transcribers, data entry workers and payroll organizers are often free to work on-site or off -- as long as they complete assignments. Charles Viagas of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, sets his own hours as an independent contractor with LiveOps, a virtual call center company that enables workers to take customer service calls at their home. The arrangement allows him to schedule hours around his wife's job and to be an active caretaker for his two young children. Education . College professors often have been able to pick the times they teach, and online schools have taken this freedom even further. Other flexible positions include substitute teachers, textbook developers and tutors. As an educational consultant, Sara Lise Raff of New York City performs a variety of duties. ""I am basically a freelancer who has clients that range from individuals (usually parents) to not-for-profits to schools,"" Raff says. ""I am generally asked to write curriculums, help with educational grant applications, create and facilitate workshops, evaluate and hire staff and act as a sounding board. I love what I do and can usually create a convenient schedule that allows me to be around for my three kids most of the time."" Artists and designers . Sculptors, painters, jewelry makers, graphic designers, photographers, illustrators and cartoonists are among the creative professionals who often enjoy job flexibility. One such artist is Steven Kubien of Ajax, Ontario. He is a full-time wood-turner who creates everything from pepper grinders to cremation urns for Green Leaf Wood Studio. He also is a stay-at-home dad who schedules his studio time around his family. Barbara McCandless is employed by Closet Factory in Virginia Beach, Virginia. ""I design and sell custom storage of all kinds -- closets, home offices, wall units, entertainment centers, kitchen pantries, laundry rooms and garage systems,"" McCandless says. ""Each month I submit a calendar on which I indicate my availability to take design appointments. I work full time, but I am free to X-out times that I need for personal appointments, vacations, etc."" One last art for consideration: comedy. ""You won't find a more flexible job than that of a comedian,"" says Dan Nainan, who left his job as a senior computer engineer to pursue his dream. ""Our actual scheduled work takes perhaps less than one hour a day, and the rest of the time is spent marketing our product and improving it.

"(CNN) -- Nearly 4,500 American soldiers lost and 32,000 wounded. A trillion dollars of borrowed money to remove Saddam Hussein and create an Iraq that would not only be safe from possessing weapons of mass destruction but also friendly toward the United States. These are the United States' heavy sacrifices in blood and treasure. One can be forgiven for expecting some Iraqi support for U.S. foreign policy aims in the region. On Monday, the Iranian-backed prime minister of Iraq, Nuri al-Maliki, met with President Barack Obama at the White House to express his thanks for liberating Iraq from Hussein and discuss next steps. The frosty news conference afterward told us that all was not well. Tense, lacking in warmth and smiles and with public disagreement about Iraq's neighbor, Syria, the appearance did not reflect a productive meeting. As the United States formally ends the almost nine-year war and nears the end of its troop withdrawal, there is still much at stake -- and it's not the relatively tiny Iraqi nation of 30 million people, but U.S. influence and foreign policy objectives in the region. The Iraqi prime minister knows that his country, particularly his armed forces, is not yet ready to contain the probable outbreak of sectarian violence. And he wants U.S. financial expertise in developing Iraq's private sector. He made no secret of wanting greater U.S. assistance on both fronts. Iraq, under al-Maliki, is keen to receive U.S. help in countering terrorism and developing its economy. It seems perfectly legitimate, therefore, for the United States to express its own expectations from Iraq. But what is the Iraqi response? First, ending, or more precisely, containing the Arab-Israeli conflict is a top priority of the U.S. in the Middle East. Iraq's support here would help bolster the U.S. position. Moreover, Iraq could financially help Palestinian activists committed to a two-state solution. But while Egypt, Jordan and Turkey recognize Israel, Iraq continues to refuse to do so. Second, the U.S. and Turkey have, mistakenly in my view, called for Syria's president, Basher al-Assad, to resign. But Iraq has defied the United States and supported the Assad regime. When Hussein killed Iraqi Shias, al-Maliki and others called for U.S. support for removing the Iraqi dictator. But the same logic does not seem to apply for al-Maliki and Iraq today. Forced to choose between the U.S. line and Iran's support for Damascus, Iraq opted for aligning with the mullahs in Tehran. Third, Iraq is seen as an outsider among Arab nations in the region today because of its political ties to Iran. Under Hussein, Iraq was a buffer against spreading Iran's religious and revolutionary fervor. U.S. attempts to isolate Iran and build regional support against Iran's nuclear weapons program are repeatedly scuppered by Iraq's failure to support such efforts, much less lead it. In contrast, Saudi Arabia (for different reasons) has been willing to support U.S. initiatives to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear warhead. With U.S. military and political presence inside Iraq coming to an end and with the passage of time, Baghdad will become ever closer to Tehran. Those who argue that the large and well-resourced U.S. embassy in Iraq will ensure that Baghdad is kept in check fail to remember that Tehran, too, once had a powerful U.S. embassy. Unless political will in Iraq exists to align with the United States, U.S. civilian contractors and a large embassy, much like in Pakistan, cannot create allies. Al-Maliki's comments at the White House, the trajectory of his government and the failure of the Obama administration to steer Iraq away from Iran raises these important questions for the United States: . What does Iran offer that the United States cannot? If after so much sacrifice, the United States cannot create an ally in Iraq, then is it realistic to expect that U.S. involvement in other nations (Syria, for example) will create U.S.-friendly regimes? Most importantly, what is it about U.S. foreign policy aims that make them so toxic for Iraq? If U.S. foreign policy is so detached from the lived reality of the Arab world, is it time to reformulate policy so that they can be accepted by those for whom the United States sacrificed so much? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ed Husain.","Ed Husain: U.S. spent vast blood and treasure on ousting Saddam Hussein, building Iraq ties .
He says when Nuri al-Maliki, Barack Obama met to formally end war, things were tense .
He says Iraq still wants U.S. help aid but avoids U.S. foreign policy aims, has ties to Iran .

"(CNN) -- A Mississippi judge Wednesday evening issued a temporary injunction forbidding the release of any more prisoners pardoned or given clemency by outgoing Gov. Haley Barbour, whose actions created an uproar. The pardons include four convicted murderers and a convicted armed robber who were released Sunday. The five now must contact prison officials on a daily basis as their fate is adjudicated. The pardons are ""a slap in the face to everyone in law enforcement and Gov. Barbour should be ashamed,"" said state Attorney General Jim Hood. The process of releasing 21 other inmates has been halted, said Hood, who sought the court order. A court hearing on the matter will be held January 23. Hood said Barbour violated Mississippi's Constitution because the pardon requests for many inmates were not published 30 days before they were granted, as required. ""He's tried to rule the state like Boss Hogg and he didn't think the law applied to him,"" Hood told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night, referring to a character in the 1980s TV series ""The Dukes of Hazzard."" ""These families are afraid out here,"" Hood said of relatives of crime victims. Hinds County Circuit Court Judge Tomie Green issued the injunction, saying it appeared some pardons, including those for the four murderers, did not meet the 30-day requirement. Any inmates released in the future must meet the standard, Green ruled. On his way out the door, the Republican governor approved full pardons for nearly 200 people, including 14 convicted murderers, according to documents the Mississippi secretary of state's office released Tuesday. The four murderers who received full pardons last week -- David Gatlin, Joseph Ozment, Charles Hooker and Anthony McCray -- were cited in Green's order. They were all serving life sentences and worked as inmate trusties at the governor's mansion, said Suzanne Singletary, spokeswoman for the Mississippi Department of Corrections. Trusties are inmates who can receive additional rights through good behavior. Hood told ""AC360"" it's possible that those who didn't meet the 30-days requirement may have to return to prison and complete their sentences. Barbour said Wednesday that some people misunderstand the clemency process and believe that most of the individuals were still jailed. ""Approximately 90 percent of these individuals were no longer in custody, and a majority of them had been out for years,"" he said in a statement. ""The pardons were intended to allow them to find gainful employment or acquire professional licenses as well as hunt and vote. My decision about clemency was based upon the recommendation of the Parole Board in more than 90 percent of the cases,"" Barbour wrote. ""The 26 people released from custody due to clemency is just slightly more than one-tenth of 1 percent of those incarcerated."" Half of the people who were released were placed on indefinite suspension ""due to (chronic) medical reasons because their health care expenses were costing the state so much money,"" Barbour said. Hood said he is questioning the release of many of the 175 individuals who received full pardons. Barbour's full pardon of Gatlin has intensified fears that the man will try ""to finish what he started,"" one of his surviving victims said. ""I feel like my safety is in jeopardy,"" Randy Walker, who was shot and wounded by Gatlin, said Wednesday. ""I wonder if he's going to finish what he's started."" Gatlin walked into a trailer in 1993 where his estranged wife, Tammy Ellis, lived and shot her in the head as she held her 6-week-old baby in her arms. Walker, the woman's friend, survived a gunshot wound to the head. Gatlin was convicted of murder, aggravated assault and burglary of a residence. Speaking in an interview with CNN's Soledad O'Brien, Walker and Tiffany Ellis Brewer, Tammy's sister, expressed concerns about the release and fears that Gatlin may intend to target them. ""I'm married and have a family again,"" Walker said. ""I feel the safety for them is an issue. Anybody that might be with me at the time that he decides to do something would be in jeopardy."" Gatlin's pardon also raised concerns from John Kitchens, the prosecutor who saw him sent to prison. ""Haley Barbour is insane for granting a pardon to this criminal,"" said Kitchens, who is now in private practice. Brewer said Barbour -- who left office this week -- hasn't responded to questions about the pardon. ""He will not comment on anything. We have no answers as to why he has done this. I would like to think he did not have all of the facts of the case, if he did have all the facts,"" she said. ""Apparently, we haven't had a really good man for our governor."" Barbour's successor, Phil Bryant, was inaugurated Tuesday. Brewer shared the fears of those families watching convicted killers of their loved ones get blanket pardons and go free. ""I'm sure that they feel basically the same way as Randy and I do. We're both fearful for our lives, our families' lives, and we will live with this for the rest of our lives,"" she said. Gatlin's whereabouts were unknown late Wednesday. Barbour, who served eight years in office, had previously granted full pardons to three other convicted killers in 2008. Another three were awarded conditional or indefinite releases during his time in office -- meaning the governor, in total, granted reprieves to 20 convicted murderers, the documents showed. Since the conservative governor took office in 2004, 222 people were granted clemency for a wide variety of crimes. Those who have been granted full pardons include shoplifters, rapists, burglars and embezzlers. There were also a number who were found guilty of either manslaughter or homicide, who were given unconditional pardons. CNN's Ed Lavandera, Rich Phillips, Vivian Kuo and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","Attorney general likens Barbour to ""Boss Hogg""

"Editor's note: Leonard Pitts Jr., a columnist for The Miami Herald, won the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for commentary and is the author of a new novel, ""Before I Forget"" and ""Becoming Dad: Black Men and the Journey to Fatherhood."" Leonard Pitts says we know what it takes to improve the performance of African-American students. (CNN) -- Back in 1972, on an episode of ""All in the Family,"" Gloria posed the following riddle to Archie and Meathead. Father and son go driving. There's an accident. The father is killed instantly, the son is rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery. The surgeon walks in, takes one look at the patient and says, ""I can't operate on this boy. He's my son."" The answer to the apparent paradox eluded Archie, Meathead and the guys down at Kelsey's bar for the balance of the half hour. They floated theories involving stepfathers, sons-in-law, priests, adoptions and returns from the dead. All of which Archie apparently found more believable than the true answer which was, of course, that the surgeon was the boy's mother. ""If that's the answer,"" he spouted, ""that's the dumbest riddle I ever hoid!"" Thirty-seven years later it is, perhaps, difficult to appreciate why this riddle ever was a riddle, how so apparent an answer could have stymied Archie, Meathead and, I would wager, the vast majority of the viewing audience. The riddle speaks volumes not just about how the world has changed in four decades, but also about how unconscious expectations can blind us to the obvious. In 1972, one expected a man when one heard the word ""surgeon."" Much as, in 2009, one expects a white kid when one hears the word ""scholar."" People will deny this, will say all the right and politic things. But the disclaimers will be as thin and transparent as Saran Wrap. Black, white and otherwise, we are all socialized by the same forces and all carry, by and large, the same unconscious assumptions. One of which is that a certain level of achievement is black and another is white. This is what you are hearing when a black kid speaks standard English and another black kid chides him for ""talking white."" This is what George W. Bush was alluding to when he decried ""the soft bigotry of low expectations."" And this is what we need to address forthrightly if we ever hope to close the so-called achievement gap that looms between black kids and white ones. In 2007 and 2008, I traveled the country for a series of columns called ""What Works,"" aimed at profiling programs that addressed that gap. I traveled between big programs and small ones, from the Harlem Children's Zone, which encompasses 90 square blocks of holistic education, family counseling, medical care and tutoring in New York City, to the Freedom Project in Sunflower County, Mississippi, which offers field trips, martial arts and academic enrichment in a rural county where the median income is $25,000 a year and the teen pregnancy rate is said to be 25 percent. I toured Self Enhancement Inc. in Portland, Oregon, a KIPP (Knowledge is Power Program) School in Gaston, North Carolina, the East Lake Foundation in Atlanta, Georgia, and many others. In all these places, I saw black kids -- well-spoken, clean-cut and noon-sun bright -- making a lie out of other peoples' expectations. Over the course of 13 months, common themes began to emerge whenever I would ask why kids such as these were doing such wondrous work in these places and substandard work elsewhere. We have more power to fire bad teachers and reward good ones, they said. We require parental involvement. We have a longer school day and a longer school year. We mentor children that need it. We counsel children and families that need it. We are invested in them and make sure they know it. Most of all, they spoke of the simple power of expectation: making it a conscious point to look for greatness in black kids in whom people had not thought to look for it before. What I came to understand in those interviews is that we already know the secret to improving academic performance for African-American children. What is missing is the will to do so. And that, I think, is because where they are concerned, we have other expectations. I asked Geoffrey Canada, founder of the Harlem Children's Zone, how he justifies asking for money to uplift poor kids in Harlem. His response struck me: ""Someone's yelling at me because I'm spending $3,500 a year on `Alfred.' 'Alfred' is 8. OK, Alfred turns 18. No one thinks anything about locking him up for 10 years at $60,000 a year."" But then, we expect Alfred to be locked up, don't we? Expect it so blithely that we will not challenge the expectation even when it works against our own economic self-interest. Canada, after all, presents a rather stark choice: invest a smaller amount early and produce a citizen who pays taxes and contributes to the system or pay a much larger amount later for the upkeep of a citizen who consumes tax monies and contributes nothing. That we consistently choose the latter says something about how we assess the educability, the salvageability, of African-American kids. Thirteen months of interviewing young scholars left me more impatient than ever with a culture that writes off black kids because they are black kids. Somewhere between the 13-year-old in rural Mississippi who wants to go to Harvard and the second-graders in Harlem studying Vincent Van Gogh, I ceased being surprised and started being angry that what I saw was still the exception and not the rule. Everywhere I went, there were black kids excelling. And at some point, you say to yourself: well, of course. What did you expect?

"(CNN) -- IBM recently released its annual 5 in 5 list, in which the technology company tries to predict emerging trends and technologies that will transform our lives over the next five years. No. 4 on this year's list concerned mobile technology. Specifically, IBM says that, thanks to mobile technology, the digital divide will soon cease to exist. In a video, IBM put it this way: ""In our global society, the wealth of economies are decided by the level of access to information. And in five years, the gap between information haves and have-nots will cease to exist due to the advent of mobile technology."" The digital divide (a term that refers to the gap between people who do and don't have high-speed Internet access) is an increasingly important issue for the nation, the economy and the world. Without Internet access, it's getting harder to apply for jobs, get an education, stay in touch with friends and family -- and keep up with news that affects your life. Still, it will probably take much longer than five years -- if ever -- for significant inequities in access to digital information and services to disappear entirely. The digital divide may look quite different in five years, but it will probably still be with us. Here's why: . Mobile phones can help close the digital divide, but using the Internet on a phone has some drawbacks. That's a point Kathryn Zickhur makes in an upcoming report on the digital divide for the Pew Internet and American Life project. ""Mobile Internet users experience the Internet differently because they have a small screen and often slower data connections. But they tend to always have their device with them -- which means they can constant access to information,"" she said. ""So mobile net users might not be able to engage with certain online services as easily as they could on a laptop computer, but they do have more ubiquitous access."" According to Pew, once consumers acquired a wireless device, they start using the Internet more actively -- especially to connect with others. People go online from their phones not just to get information, but to share and create -- even more than before. Pew also found that a substantial portion of U.S. adults are choosing smartphones over computers for Internet access. Young adults (aged 18-29), blacks and Hispanics, people who never attended college, and those with an annual household income of less than $30,000 are not only more likely than the average American to use smartphones -- they're also especially likely use their phone as their main way to get online. Furthermore, about a third of Americans who mostly go online from their phones don't have high-speed broadband internet access at home. Then there's the problem of who does or does not have high-speed Internet access. What constitutes ""fast enough"" online access is a moving target as technology and online services evolve. As I wrote earlier, even in developed nations like the United States, not everyone with a mobile device will have access to -- or more importantly, be able to afford -- robust mobile devices and fast (4G speeds or above) wireless data networks. A couple of years ago 3G qualified as ""wireless broadband,"" but as U.S. carriers roll out faster 4G networks, increasingly having only 3G access may leave you on the wrong side of the digital divide. In order to get faster 4G network access on your mobile device, you'll need a 4G compatible phone and a 4G data plan. These cost consumers more than simpler handsets and slower networks. However, Paul Bloom, IBM's chief technology officer for telco research, did note a few intriguing mobile trends that could help lessen the digital divide in the next five years. One of these is ""peer-to-peer access"" -- in which mobile devices can connect directly with each other, rather than though cable or phone companies. This could provide more Internet access to more people, at least within a fairly small geographic location. ""If you have bandwidth that you're not using, someone else who needs additional bandwidth communicates with you to get that additional access,"" wrote Bloom. In addition to redistributing existing Internet access, peer-to-peer networking technologies (such as near field communications or Bluetooth) can allow people to set up their own local independent miniature Internet -- a technique called ""mesh networking."" Earlier this year protesters in Egypt set up mesh networks to get around government-imposed blackouts of Internet and phone access. Bloom also noted the growing role of ""machine-to-machine communications,"" which could allow cell phones and other mobile devices to connect people to useful services. ""People won't initiate communication for information,"" he predicted. ""For example, your mobile phone will have access to your electronic health care records while also monitoring your vitals, such as blood pressure, in real time. A system could notify and connect you to a doctor if your blood pressure is out of a normal range."" In the next five years we will undoubtedly see lots more wearable mobile devices (such as the new Jawbone UP health monitor) and communication-enabled ""smarter objects"" in our environment (such as smart appliances). Over time, these extra points of data and communication will also interact with phones (even simpler, cheaper phones) to play some role in diminishing the digital divide. But we won't get there in five short years. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","IBM says mobile technology will close the digital divide .

"Paris (CNN) -- Turkey is fuming over French legislation that would criminalize any public denial of what the bill calls the Armenian genocide last century in Ottoman Turkey. ""We are reviewing our relations with France,"" Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after the French National Assembly passed the so-called Armenian genocide bill. ""We will take our measures phase by phase depending on France's behavior from now on. Erdogan said Turkey is recalling its Paris ambassador for consultations to Ankara, is canceling bilateral visits, and won't cooperate with France in joint projects within the European Union. ""We are stopping all kinds of political consultations with France. We are canceling bilateral military activities and joint exercises from now on. We are canceling the permission granted annually for all military overflights, landings and take-offs. We are starting permission process for every military flight individually. From today on, we are rejecting the permission requests of military ships to visit ports. We will not attend and held the bilateral Turkey-France joint economic and trade partnership committee meeting that was planned for January 2012 under the co-chairmanship of the economy ministers of the two countries,"" Erdogan said. ""I am underlining this. This is the first phase."" The bill -- applauded by Armenians -- must now be voted on by the country's senate. Erdogan said he hopes the French Senate will vote down the bill. ""New measures will come to the agenda depending on the progress of the bill in France and we will apply them with determination without any hesitation."" Armenian groups and many scholars argue that starting in 1915, Turks committed genocide, when more than a million ethnic Armenians were massacred in the waning days of the Ottoman Empire. But modern-day Turkey officially denies that a genocide took place, arguing instead that hundreds of thousands of Armenian Christians and Muslim Turks died in intercommunal violence around the bloody battlefields of World War I. The genocide debate is an annual source of tension between Turkey and the United States, two NATO military allies. The White House annually beats back efforts in Congress to pass a resolution which would formally recognize the 1915 massacre of Armenians as genocide. ""The issue should be researched not by politicians, but by historians,"" Turkish Parliament Speaker Cemil Cicek said. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told Turkish lawmakers Thursday that Turkey is a friend and ally of France and strives to maintain a dialogue. Armenia's foreign minister, Edward Nalbandian, hailed the move, saying France ""reconfirmed its high place of being the cradle of human rights and once again proved its commitment to universal human values."" ""The French people showed that human rights are highest value, and today by adopting this bill,"" he said, indicating that crimes against humanity have no statute of limitations and deserve condemnation. According to official Turkish statistics, the volume of trade between Turkey and France from January to the end of October this year was more than $13.5 billion.

"(CNN) -- Hours after raucous University of Kentucky students torched cars and couches after their men's basketball team advanced to the NCAA championship, the Wildcats' coach said that he understood fans' passion but was ""disappointed"" by some of their actions. ""The state of Kentucky is so connected to this program. It's the commonwealth's team,"" coach John Calipari told reporters Sunday. ""They go overboard sometimes."" Top-seeded Kentucky wrapped up its 69-61 win over in-state rival Louisville on Saturday night, in the first of two semifinal games in the NCAA tourney widely known as March Madness. The victory spurred hundreds of Wildcat backers to exit bars, restaurants and residences in the school's hometown of Lexington and flood the streets, many of them raising their fists and screaming for joy. SI.com: Kansas star looks to redeem himself . Members of the city police force watched the revelry, including celebrating students who partied around several cars and couches that had been lit on fire, said police Lt. Mark Brand. Video from the scene, from CNN affiliate WLEX, showed flames rising into the sky as fire trucks attempted to navigate through the crowd. At least one car could be seen overturned, and the University of Kentucky's Twitter feed noted reports of ""several criminal incidents"" and the temporary closure of a number of roads. Brand, from the Lexington police, said that authorities weren't able to get the situation along one road, State Street, fully under control until nearly 1 a.m. -- some four hours after the Wildcats' game ended. Some students were arrested, but police did not reveal the number. Brand did say that at least one person suffered a minor injury, a scraped knee. Calipari defended Kentucky's fans during a press conference in New Orleans, where his team is preparing to face the University of Kansas in the finals on Monday night. The Wildcats, who entered the tourney as the nation's consensus No. 1 team, are favored going into the showdown, according to oddsmakers. The coach said that, while they fervently support their team and might rejoice in its victories, Kentucky supporters would never show up an opponent. ""Our fans are the classiest,"" Calipari said, adding that they'd never ""storm the court"" as some do after a big win. ""They're not vicious to the opponent. They're not that way.""

"(CNN) -- A frequently overlooked place of farms, friendly towns and relatively few people is, for now, the epicenter of U.S. politics. The place is Iowa. The question is Why-owa? The answer is a quaint and quirky institution known as the Iowa caucuses -- an unusual, old-fashioned evening of talking about the candidates running for president and then voting on them. Separate caucuses are held across Iowa as neighbors debate the pros and cons of candidates with each other before they vote among themselves, and that result then gets totted up with the other caucuses statewide to decide the winner. The U.S. presidential campaign has been under way for months as Republicans decide who they want to run against the presumed Democrat candidate, the incumbent President Barack Obama. Candidates have spoken at rallies, debated each other on TV and opinion polls are released at least weekly. But the Iowa caucuses, to be held on Tuesday January 3, are the first time anyone will actually vote. ""The Iowa caucuses are really like nothing else in American politics,"" said CNN Political Editor Paul Steinhauser. ""I mean, imagine a cold winter night, sub-freezing temperatures. It takes a lot for a person to come out to their local school, the local church and take part for about two hours in a caucus. You've really got to be into the process."" Americans have long chosen their presidential candidates sequentially state by state. Most states hold what they call 'primaries' -- primary elections -- to choose delegates to attend national conventions later in the year that formally select the Democratic and Republican party nominees. This year, all attention so far has been on the fight to become the Republican nominee because Obama is expected to be the Democratic candidate. To a casual visitor the primaries look a lot like any election, with the familiar routines of voters, ballot boxes and booths. But Iowa caucuses are different and the rules vary in the roughly 1,800 state precincts that hold them. There isn't necessarily a secret ballot; sometimes there's no ballot at all. After everyone gets a chance to express their opinions, the vote can be on paper, with a show of hands or, for Democrats, just by congregating into groups corresponding to the different candidates and seeing who has the biggest group. It's a particular kind of politics with a long past. The caucuses date back in different forms more than 150 years. But they never attracted much attention until the 1970s when Iowa moved its caucuses ahead of the first primary and decided to stage them all on the same evening. The media started paying attention and candidates learned that a strong showing could generate headlines nationwide. Even so, winning Iowa doesn't predict much because with just three million people, the state is so small, so rural, so white and, these days, so affluent. Its agriculture-based economy is doing well enough to be spared the worst of America's economic downturn. A recent New York Times/CBS News poll found that nearly 90 percent of likely caucus-goers described their financial situation as good. The Times says that's about 20 points higher than the average nationwide. So maybe it's no surprise that, looking back over the decades, the most popular candidates in Iowa don't tend to get their party's nomination or the presidency. To be fair, Iowa did do better than usual last time: it was half right. On the Republican side, Mike Huckabee won his party's caucuses in 2008, but he didn't win the Republican nomination and he's not the president today. The Democratic caucuses that year were more telling. Barack Obama did win them, the start of a long and surprising campaign that ended in the White House. So does Iowa matter? Historian Hugh Winebrenner writes at IowaPolitics.Com that it does because America's media say it does. ""Iowa is first,"" Winebrenner notes. The ""caucuses provide early evidence -- hard news -- on the progress of the presidential race. This is the perception of Iowa's role, and it is therefore the reality..."" But there is more to the reality. Even if Iowa doesn't add much to the process, it does subtract. After the Iowa caucuses the most successful or determined candidates will stay in the race and head to the northeastern state of New Hampshire for its primary, the first in the nation, on January 10. The others tend to start heading home. This year, the Republican race is so unsettled, with so many candidates trading the top spots in public opinion polls, that Iowa could be unusually close and confusing. And quirky. You can count on quirky.","After months of debates and rallies Iowa is the first state where people actually get to vote for a candidate .
The state holds caucuses where communities debate each candidate's merits before voting, sometimes with a show of hands .
Iowa's status as first to vote means it is watched closely although it does not always pick the eventual winner .

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo scored a late penalty to give 10-man Real Madrid a 1-1 draw in the second ""El Clasico"" of the Spanish season on Saturday that left Barcelona on course for a third successive La Liga title. Lionel Messi equaled the record of 49 goals in a Spanish season with a penalty six minutes after halftime, with Real defender Raul Albiol sent off for dragging down David Villa. Real, thrashed 5-0 in the Catalan capital in November, fought back despite the numerical disadvantage and leveled with nine minutes to play after Marcelo was fouled by Barca fullback Daniel Alves. The result left the visitors eight points clear at the top of the table with six games to play, ahead of Wednesday's Copa Del Rey final between the two teams in Valencia. Marvelous Mourinho record falls -- but will it ever be beaten? They will also meet in the semifinals of the European Champions League, with the first leg in Madrid on April 27 and the return on May 3. ""A draw at the Bernabeu is a good result and I am happy with how we played, although maybe we could have done better at 1-0,"" Barca coach Pep Guardiola told AFP after dropping his first points in six league games against Real since taking over the role in 2008. ""I don't think we are league champions (yet) as we have to play against teams that are still fighting for their lives."" Jose Mourinho, wary of a repeat of his worst defeat as a club coach, started with a defensive line-up as Pepe was pushed forward into a three-man midfield alongside Xavi Alonso and Sami Khedira to combat Barcelona's attacking potency. Villa appealed in vain for a penalty in the 26th minute after going down under the challenge of goalkeeper Iker Casillas, and it was Real who went closest to scoring first as defender Adriano had to clear Ronaldo's header from a corner off the line just before halftime. The Portugal forward hit the base of Victor Valdes' post with a dipping freekick five minutes after the interval, but Real went behind straight away when Albiol hauled down Villa in the box after first appearing to handle the ball. Messi record as Barcelona reach semis . Messi stepped up to score his first goal against one of Mourinho's teams and match the mark set by legendary Hungarian Ferenc Puskas in the 1959-60 season -- his 30th league goal in just 29 games. Mourinho shuffled his cards by bringing on attacking midfielder Mesut Ozil for striker Karim Benzema, and Barca lost captain Carles Puyol to a hamstring injury before Xavi shaved the top of Casillas' bar with a swirling shot. The influential Puyol had returned after three months out with a knee injury, but is now in doubt for the remaining three Clasicos. Real refused to give in, and the introduction of striker Emmanuel Adebayor helped spark a series of attacks that could have brought more reward than just Ronaldo's penalty after Alves brought down his fellow Brazilian. He sent Valdes the wrong way for his 41st goal this season, 29 of them in La Liga, to set up a tense finish with even the usually calm Messi losing his cool. Khedira had the chance to snatch an 89th-minute winner but the Germany international shot low at Valdes, and Barcelona held on in four minutes of time added on. Valencia consolidated third place with a 3-0 win at bottom club Almeria earlier on Saturday, closing the gap on Real to 13 points. Striker Roberto Soldado scored his seventh goal in three games, heading his 13th this season to open the scoring six minutes after halftime from Jeremy Mathieu's cross. Lithuanian defender Marius Stankevicius doubled the lead from close range on 66, and midfielder Jordi Alba wrapped it up with a volley 10 minutes from time. The win put Unai Emery's team nine points clear of fourth-placed Villarreal, who host third-bottom Real Zaragoza on Monday. Fifth-placed Sevilla suffered a shock 1-0 defeat at Getafe, who moved four points away from the relegation zone after ending a run of nine league games without a win. Venezuelan striker Miku scored the only goal with 14 minutes to play to give the Madrid-based team some breathing space. Malaga moved out of the bottom three on goal difference above Zaragoza with a much-needed 3-0 victory at home to 10th-placed Mallorca. Uruguayan striker Sebastian Fernandez opened the scoring in the 26th minute before Brazilian forward scored a goal in each half to boost coach Manuel Pellegrini, who at this stage last season was still in charge of Real Madrid.","Barcelona maintain eight-point lead in Spain after 1-1 draw away to rivals Real Madrid .

"(CNN) -- World No. 2 Rafael Nadal battled from behind to win another epic encounter with his great rival Roger Federer on Thursday and earn a place in the Australian Open final. The Spaniard triumphed 6-7 (5-7) 6-2 7-6 (7-5) 6-4 in three hours and 42 minutes as he set up a clash with either defending champion Novak Djokovic or British fourth seed Andy Murray, who meet in Friday's second semifinal. Nadal, seeking his 11th grand slam title, extended his winning record over Swiss third seed Federer to 18-9 -- and 8-2 in major tournaments. Federer, who has a record 16 grand slam titles to his name, saved a match point but was unable to repeat the form that had seen the 30-year-old not drop a set in his previous five matches in Melbourne. It capped a remarkable turnaround in fortunes for Nadal, who feared that he might not be fit to start the tournament. ""Sunday afternoon, 24 hours to play my first match, I was in my room crying because I believed I didn't have the chance to play in Melbourne,"" he told reporters. ""Two weeks later I am here in the finals, so it is a dream for me because I had very bad expectations 24 hours before the first match, and now two weeks later I am playing well. I am in the final. ""It's a fantastic victory for me. I'm very, very happy playing against the greatest in history in semifinals, in a big match on Rod Laver Arena. It's one of the victories that's going to stay in my mind forever."" Federer has not beaten Nadal at a grand slam tournament since Wimbledon in 2007 but the Swiss took the opening set on a tiebreak. Nadal, who lost six finals to Djokovic last year and his No. 1 ranking, responded with a determination that he seems to reserve for matches against his friend and longtime foe. ""We have had good matches over the years,"" Federer said. ""I enjoy playing him. The crowd really gets into it, which is nice. We have a lot of respect for each other, which is good, too, I think. ""We also play well against each other. I always think he plays a bit better against me than against other players, but that's good for him."" Even an extended break for Australia Day fireworks in the second set could not halt the 25-year-old Nadal's momentum, as he won 11 points in a row. ""It's not helpful, that's for sure,"" Federer said. ""I probably don't want to say I would have lost the set anyway, but I was down in the score.

"Miami (CNN) -- The death of Trayvon Martin is an undeniable tragedy. People are outraged, and rightly so, because a young, unarmed teenager lost his life. The incident has brought Florida's ""stand your ground"" law into sharp focus in the center of a media and legal firestorm. The shooting of Martin was not something that the Florida Legislature anticipated would happen when it enacted the law in 2005. When the law was pushed through the legislature, its supporters, including the National Rifle Association, proclaimed it as necessary to give law-abiding citizens the ability to protect themselves. The law expanded an individual's legal right to use force, including deadly force, in self-defense. And it allows it in any place, not just in one's home, without fear of civil or criminal consequences when the individual has a ""reasonable"" fear of death or great bodily harm. The National Rifle Association lobbied hard for the law in Florida, which passed the House and Senate with almost no opposition. Based on its resounding success in Florida, the NRA lobbied for similar legislation in many other states. The vast majority of these acts also passed. One cannot entirely fault the NRA for supporting the bill. Simply put, it's good for business. As people are encouraged to purchase and use firearms to protect themselves, presumably more guns are purchased and more individuals join the association. However, it's becoming increasingly clear that the ramifications of the law are murky. In hindsight, it's easy to say the Florida Legislature should have been troubled by the law when it was introduced in the state. And that more attention should have been paid to law enforcement officers and prosecutors who strongly opposed it. Now, these people's fears have proved to be well-founded. For police and prosecutors, the law causes confusion as to when prosecution is appropriate. The statute has led to many nonprosecutions after investigations -- it is hard to find that a person did not act in self-defense when the person that was being defended against cannot refute the allegations, i.e., dead men don't talk. Many blame the present lack of prosecution in the Martin case on the law. George Zimmerman's belief in his right to use a firearm in self-defense against Martin is difficult to dispute. And legally, the police cannot simply arrest and prosecute him for Martin's death. So the question remains: Is the law working for the residents of Florida and other states? The answer depends on your perspective. More cases result in no prosecution because of the law, and the law has led to a variety of wins for defendants on motions to dismiss before a trial by jury. Potential defendants and their attorneys undoubtedly see this as a positive change and certainly there are instances where the use of force in self-defense is warranted. But this expanded right to self-defense comes at a price -- more individuals are likely to use deadly force because they feel protected by the law, and more innocent people who may have been in the wrong place at the wrong time are likely to die or be seriously injured as a result. Trayvon Martin's death highlights the potential deficiencies and problematic aspects of the law. Let's hope it will force the Florida Legislature and legal system to face these difficult gray areas in what perhaps seemed like a straightforward law when it was passed. Regardless of how the facts of the Martin case play out, lawmakers and the public that elects them should consider whether the law is a benefit to all citizens. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Zachary L. Weaver.","Florida's 'stand your ground' law permit citizens to use force in self-defense .

"Editor's note: Business Insider is contributing a series of columns to CNN.com that challenge commonly held beliefs about the tech world. (Business Insider)  -- Apple's iPad tablet isn't just for geeks, yuppies, and rich people. It's also for grandparents. That may not be the target audience you're thinking of for a $500 piece of high-tech metal and glass. But it actually makes sense. Why is that? First and foremost, the iPad is incredibly simple to use, and easy to learn. (After more than 100 days of owning one, I love it.) For older people, or especially for inexperienced computer users, that's very helpful. Because the iPad is just a 10-inch touch panel, all you need to think about and interact with is what's on the screen. There are no hidden menus to have to learn about, or buttons to think about. There's no need to master double-clicking or right-clicking. You just touch what you want. So while there is some learning curve for the iPad, it should be much easier than trying to figure out the intricacies of Windows or even a Mac. And the touch-based user interface should seem very intuitive. There isn't anything much simpler than just touching what you want from the screen. Second, the iPad is easy for the sort of stuff we imagine our grandparents would want to do with it: Reading the web, e-books with large-as-you-want-it text, magazine articles, and email; looking at photographs and videos; filling out crossword puzzles; and writing short messages. Some of these apps are built in; others can be downloaded quickly and easily from the iPad app store. The iPad is admittedly not very good for writing longer e-mails, but that's where an optional wireless keyboard or keyboard dock could be helpful. And it's not designed (yet) for printing stuff, but there are some work-arounds available, depending on what sort of printer you have, what you want to print, or if you want to go through a computer to print. Lastly, the iPad is a great tool for grandparents for the same reason candy is -- their grandkids love it! Consider what my colleague Henry Blodget has written at Business Insider, under the title ""HELP! My Kids Are Addicted To My iPad."" He says, ""We got an iPad because we thought it might provide more peace and quiet during a long trip. And it did. Sometimes. When they weren't fighting over it."" He adds, ""A month after we bought it, the iPad has become so central to our household that we have to hide it. And in relatively short order, to preserve my family harmony, I'm probably going to have to buy two more of the damn things."" So if there's one way to be the most popular grandparents in the family, it's by keeping an iPad in the living room, stocked with kids' games, e-books, and the Netflix app for movies and TV shows. (Or, when it's cheaper in a few years, an iPad in every room.) If I were a kid now, I'd love going over to grandma and grandpa's house to play with their iPad -- just as I loved going to my grandparents' house in the '90s because they had cable and MTV, and we didn't at home. Apple's device is set to be one of the most desired gifts this holiday season. Its mainstream appeal -- to all age groups and levels of tech-savviness, even grandparents -- is a big reason why.

"(CNN) -- A month after defending the health care law, the Obama administration again confronted the buzz saw of skeptical Supreme Court justices on Wednesday -- this time on immigration. But come November, Republicans may very well be on the losing end of the argument. As has been widely reported, oral arguments regarding Arizona's SB 1070 illegal immigration law began with an unusual interruption: Chief Justice John Roberts broke in during U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli's opening comments to ask assertively, ""No part of your argument has to do with racial or ethnic profiling, does it?"" And, while it is difficult to predict how the justices will rule, Justice Sonia Sotomayor signaled the tough road ahead when she said of the administration's argument, ""You can see it's not selling very well."" But in the court of public opinion, Arizona's SB 1070 law has stirred the fastest-growing electorate in the nation: Latino voters, who made up 7.4% of all voters in 2008. Republicans are in serious trouble. Co-authored by one of Mitt Romney's informal advisers, signed into law by Republican Gov. Jan Brewer, and touted by Romney endorsers, SB 1070 is the gum sticking to the presumptive nominee's general election shoes. And President Obama knows it. In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Obama said, ""I don't think that their nominee is going to be able to suddenly say, 'Everything I've said for the last six months, I didn't mean.' "" The mind-boggling part is that Romney knew branding himself as an anti-immigrant firebrand was going to present a problem in the general election. But instead of moderating his approach -- as Republican strategists implored -- he doubled down. Guided by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who is co-author of SB 1070, Romney endorsed the concept of ""self-deportation"" of undocumented immigrants while trying to talk about the Latino community's economic needs. He went even further by saying he would halt lawsuits against SB 1070 ""on day one"" of his presidency -- surely agitating thousands of Latino voters in Arizona in the process. No voter is going to listen to Romney's economic message if he wants the voter's mother to ""self-deport."" Political common knowledge suggests the Republican candidate needs at least 40% of the Latino vote in order to hang drapes at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. In fact, Latino, Asian and other new immigrant voters may well provide the margin of victory in Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Florida, North Carolina and Virginia. What's a candidate for president to do? Regardless of the Supreme Court's decision, the Obama re-election campaign would like to believe SB 1070 opens the floodgates for the madre of all get-out-the-vote efforts. But leading an administration that has detained and deported a record 1.2 million people, the president has a trust deficit of his own. Obama needs to use the powers granted to the executive branch to fully implement new guidelines that prioritize immigration enforcement resources. The only way he can make up for Democrats' inability to deliver immigration reform is to take decisive action and continue to deport people here illegally who mean to do us harm -- but stop deporting landscapers, nannies and their hardworking families. Clearly, Romney has the bigger challenge. He cannot smile and nod his way out of this problem, as he tried to do at a recent meeting with Hispanics in the Phoenix area. To a former University of Arizona president's question about the DREAM Act, Romney responded, ""Thank you. Appreciate it, thank you."" To earn anywhere near a winning percentage of Latino votes, Romney must redirect citizens' frustration with the broken immigration system away from SB 1070 and its copycats, and join Republicans such as Jeb Bush, John McCain and Lindsey Graham, all of whom have called for immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship for the undocumented. For political cover, Romney can look to a growing alliance of conservative faith, business and law enforcement leaders working together across the country to forge a new consensus on immigrants and America. If Republicans fail to appreciate the anger and frustration of new American voters and their allies who want pragmatic immigration solutions, a different buzz saw -- one of electoral justice -- will decide their fate come November. And it will not be pretty. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ali Noorani.","The Supreme Court heard oral arguments about Arizona's immigration law .
Ali Noorani: Arizona's law matters to the fastest growing electorate, Latino voters .

"(Financial Times) -- The Bank of Japan announced further easing measures on Friday, as economic data suggested slowing growth and persistent deflationary forces in the world's third-largest economy. The BoJ increased the scale of its key asset-purchasing programme by Y5tn ($61.7bn) to Y70tn, while adjusting the terms to allow it to buy more government debt, and with longer maturities. It also kept interest rates at between zero and 0.1 per cent. Before the announcement market expectations had been building that the BoJ would underline its commitment to the ""powerful monetary easing"" as it was described by governor Masaaki Shirakawa during a trip to the US last week. Politicians within Japan have also been urging the BoJ to do more to fight the nation's chronic state of mild deflation, threatening to strip the bank of its independence should it fail to act aggressively. Analysts noted, however, that Friday's move was at the low end of expectations of an additional Y5tn to Y10tn of easing. ""While it is positive that the BoJ acted, it is not sufficient to recover its long-lost credibility as an inflation-fighter,"" said Takuji Okubo, chief Japan economist at Société Générale. Economic data on Friday supported the case for continuing loose policy. Industrial production rose a less-than-expected 1 per cent in March from February, while manufacturers said they planned to cut output by as much as 4.1 per cent in May. While consumer price inflation numbers were a little brighter, with the headline nationwide index rising 0.5 per cent year-on-year, core CPI in Tokyo (excluding food and energy) fell by 1 per cent in April from a year earlier, deteriorating from -0.9 per cent in March. This ""chilly set of data"" showed that manufacturers are still cautious on the outlook for exports, leaving Japan reliant on buoyant domestic demand as its main source of growth this year, said Mr Okubo. In February the central bank surprised markets by adding Y10tn to its asset-purchasing programme while adopting a firmer goal for inflation of 1 per cent, touching off a fall in the yen. Since then, though, the BoJ has kept its settings largely unchanged. In March the board expanded the terms of a special lending facility set up in June 2010, while earlier this month it confirmed details of a new Y1tn lending facility, denominated in US dollars, which it announced in March. Meanwhile, the yen has resumed its strengthening trend. In the past month it has gained against every other G10 currency. One hour after the announcement on Friday the yen was 0.4 per cent weaker at 81.23 against the dollar, while the Nikkei 225 stock average gained 0.3 per cent. ""Not moving [on Friday] was not an option,"" said Shogo Fujita, chief Japanese bond strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Tokyo. © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .","The BoJ increased the scale of its key asset-purchasing programme by Y5tn to Y70tn.

"(CNN) -- The United States is sailing back into the Asia-Pacific region, but initial euphoria is being tempered by the dangerous realities of the work left to be done. Like a new college student heading off to school, it is increasingly apparent that gaining admission was the easy part: To graduate requires a full commitment, and there are a number of hurdles along the way. Already, tough decisions are being made with respect to the United States' global defense strategy, which now recognizes that costly wars with little economic return are no longer viable. Yet while the United States increasingly seeks to obtain a greater share of the Asia Pacific's economic growth, it similarly sees its military presence in the region as critical for maintaining security. Barack Obama reaffirmed this strategy at the Pentagon on Thursday, stating that ""budget reductions will not come at the expense of this critical region."" Importantly, the United States' strong military and diplomatic re-engagement with Asia-Pacific countries, particularly those in Southeast Asia, has not fallen on deaf ears in China. Sharing his concerns with respect to increasing international influence on domestic affairs, Hu Jintao warned in a January 1 statement, ""Hostile international powers are strengthening their efforts to Westernize and divide us."" Adding to the tension of the United States' newfound strategy are the political transitions that will, or are likely to occur, in 2012. The U.S. presidential election, presidential leadership change in China and South Korea, and now the volatile political transition in North Korea will encourage tough rhetoric from politicians with respect to international relations in order to appease constituencies. Strong words present a serious challenge to stability in the Asia-Pacific, particularly as the United States ramps up its military presence. The starting point in the run-up to the United States' East Asian convocation was Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's October 11 article, ""America's Pacific Century,"" published in Foreign Policy. She identified five areas for re-engaging the region, including bilateral security, deepening working relationships, multilateralism, trade and finally, human rights and democracy. The areas Clinton outlined for re-engagement are also important to Asia-Pacific states, and particularly the relatively small Southeast Asian nations. Yet while trade relations with the United States are vital for sustaining Southeast Asia's significant economic growth, the greatest gains from increased cooperation with America will come in the form of military protection. Across the region, governments are increasingly concerned with China's military might, as much as they are happy with China's economic investments. Teaming with the United States is a sensible insurance policy. But the United States' increased military presence in the region, which will include marines in Australia, naval ships in Singapore and increased military cooperation with the Philippines and Vietnam, while having the potential to lend stability, also raises the stakes as to what could go wrong. Now, more than ever, with impending political change on both sides of the Pacific, politicians are keen to assert themselves as strong on defense and as advocates of their respective national interests. One instance in which heightened regional tensions are especially evident is with the increasingly frequent spats over energy reserves in the South China Sea, an area recognized by the Philippines as the ""West Philippine Sea"" and by Vietnam as the ""East Sea."" The lack of consensus with respect to a name for the same body of water evidences how possessive governments are of this energy-rich area. Regarding their maritime claims, Philippines Secretary for Foreign Affairs Albert Del Rosario stated in December that the United States is increasingly willing to assist the Philippines' efforts to develop a ""minimum credible defense posture"" with respect to the disputed territories. However, recent and planned U.S. military actions in the Asia-Pacific could be construed by China as exceeding a ""minimum,"" and incidents such as one in October 2011, in which a Philippines naval vessel bumped into a Chinese fishing boat alleged to be encroaching on the former's territorial waters, now have a greater potential to escalate. Ultimately America needs to recognize and respect the accomplishments China has achieved in its own backyard, in spite of the country's shortfalls in winning over the trust of its neighbors. After directing its attention largely elsewhere for most of the last decade, America has pragmatically recognized that its own long-term security, whether at home or abroad, is tied closely to the Asia-Pacific region's economic progress. East Asian countries have shown they are willing to offer the United States opportunities for investment in return for security assistance. But without effective dialogue with China in particular, the risk of military escalation is much more real. The United States just exited one costly war and is ramping down another; it therefore needs to ensure it doesn't lose sight of its economic priorities in the Asia-Pacific, and the best way to do this is through more effective dialogue with China with regard to its military intentions. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew Billo.","America is rightly focusing on Asia but it must recognize the risks, says Andre Billo .
He says Asian nations fear China's power but appreciate its investments .
U.S. is seen by these countries as a security counterweight to China, he says .

"(CNN) -- British challenger Dereck Chisora has risked the wrath of WBC heavyweight champion Vitali Klitschko by slapping his opponent at the weigh-in ahead of their title fight on Saturday. Underdog Chisora struck Ukrainian Klitschko as the two went face-to-face after they had taken to the scales 24 hours prior to their bout in Munich. A stunned Klitschko took a step back after Chisora's slap before both fighters' entourages became involved in a brief scuffle. The 40-year-old, who has a record of 43 wins from 45 fights, vowed to take revenge on Chisora when the two square off in Germany. ""I'll be hitting him back tomorrow, in the ring,"" Klitschko told reporters. '""He's not all there. Dereck is full of nervousness and I feel he is afraid, otherwise he would not have jumped back like he did. ""He hit me not like a boxer but like a woman, with an open hand. If he wants to fight properly, he must do that with his fists."" Chisora pulled a similarly controversial stunt when he planted a kiss on Derek Baker before their fight in 2010. He then knocked Baker out in the second round of their bout. The 28-year-old has twice been scheduled to Klitschko only for the champion to pull out both times with injury. He has won 15 of his 17 professional fights and is a former British heavyweight champion. Vitali's brother Wladimir currently holds four heavyweight belts and beat another British heavyweight, David Haye, in his last fight. Wladimir is due to fight former cruiserweight world champion, Jean-Marc Mormeck, from France, on March 3.","British fighter Dereck Chisora slaps Vitali Klitschko at weigh-in ahead of their fight .

"Charlottesville, Virginia (CNN) -- Jury selection in the trial of a University of Virginia lacrosse player who is accused of fatally beating his ex-girlfriend got off to a slow start Monday. Many who were questioned were dismissed because they said they already knew too much about the case, were emotionally invested and did not believe they could be fair and impartial jurors. George Huguely faces charges including first-degree murder in the May 2010 death of Yeardley Love, a 22-year-old senior who was also a lacrosse player. Early Monday, he appeared in court and pleaded not guilty. Love's mother wiped away tears as the charges were read. Police were initially called to Love's off-campus Charlottesville apartment by a roommate who reported ""a possible alcohol overdose,"" said Police Chief Tim Longo at the time. ""It was quickly apparent to them this young lady was the victim of something far worse,"" Longo said. A medical examiner ruled that blunt force trauma killed Love, and authorities allege Huguely caused it during an altercation. ""George Huguely admitted on May 3, 2010, that he was involved in an altercation with Yeardly Love and that during the course of the altercation he shook Love and her head repeatedly hit the wall,"" Charlottesville Police Detective Lisa Reeves wrote in a sworn statement used to obtain a search warrant in the case. Love had ""a large bruise on the right side of her face which appears to have been caused by blunt force trauma,"" according to the document. She was found face-down in a pool of blood. Love and Huguely played on their school's highly ranked lacrosse teams. Huguely admitted to kicking open the door to Love's bedroom after he found her apartment door unlocked, according to the detective's affidavit. He also admitted he took her computer from her apartment, Reeves wrote. It was later found by police after Huguely told them where he disposed of it, she said. Huguely's lawyers contend Love's death was a ""tragic"" accident. ""George Huguely only learned that Yeardley Love had died when he was told that by a detective,"" attorney Rhonda Quagliana told reporters soon after Huguely's arrest. Ahead of Monday's trial, a crush of reporters descended on the college town. ""It's attention to a trial by the national media that we haven't seen here before,"" university spokesman Ric Barrick told CNN affiliate WJZ. The trial is expected to last two weeks.","NEW: George Huguely pleads not guilty .

"(CNN) -- Thursday night's Republican presidential debate in Jacksonville, Florida, sponsored by CNN, will be one of more than 20 such encounters in the past nine months. Beltway conventional wisdom says there have been too many debates. With a slight too-cool-for-school groan and accompanying eye-roll, the argument goes like this: The debates have taken up too much time for the candidates and their campaigns; they distract from retail campaigning and fundraising; they give the media too much of a role in the voters' vetting process. But I take a different view: The debates have been a valuable addition to this election cycle. And two-thirds of South Carolina primary voters seem to agree, saying that the debates played an important role in helping them make up their minds. Expensive television ads, in contrast, seem to have lost some power of persuasion. This is a good thing -- the debates have imposed an unprecedented degree of transparency and accountability on this GOP presidential race. On a debate stage, standing side by side with their competitors, candidates have not been able to entirely hide behind huge sums of money, super PACs, or television ads. They have been judged by the voters based on their working knowledge of policy and their ability to think and speak on their feet. It is a good test of presidential mettle -- and character is revealed as well as intellect over the course of the debates. No one can say that the debates haven't had an impact. Tim Pawlenty probably regrets his premature decision to get out of the race after the Iowa Straw Poll. But it was his failure to repeat a clever line about ""Obamney Care"" to Mitt Romney's face that caused many voters and donors to conclude that he didn't have the toughness to take on the top job. Rick Perry entered the campaign in August as the savior conservatives were looking for, fulfilling a litmus test checklist of fiscal and social conservative positions that seemed to also resonate with the tea party. In his Texas re-election effort, Perry had stopped talking to editorial boards as part of a pushback on ""media elites"" -- but he couldn't avoid the debates. And once in them, he couldn't avoid his propensity to stumble over his own tongue. A few epic brain freezes later, Perry's reputation as a political heavyweight was done. Newt Gingrich's rise to top-two status is almost entirely due to strong debate performances, balancing Republican red-meat rhetoric with thoughtful policy prescriptions. Yes, it's true that some his best moments have come when he defiantly pushed back on questions and got the audience loudly on his side, but that was a measure of his ability to connect with voters by voicing their frustrations. He rose from the political dead not with money or organization, but with what he carried into the debates. Mitt Romney succeeded in gliding through the first dozen debates as the de facto front-runner, as other candidates seemed reluctant to take him on hard. He consequently was able to focus his attacks on President Obama -- a strategy that served him well for a while, by reminding the Republican base that at least they had one thing in common with Mitt Romney: a dislike bordering on disrespect for the president. But it was the insistence from other candidates during the debates that Romney release his tax returns that made the Cayman Islands and the ""carried interest"" tax provision subjects of interest during the campaign. And Ron Paul and Rick Santorum's debate performances have enabled them to attract new supporters, speaking their respective truths to mass audiences they might not have otherwise reached. To top it off, these debates have been widely watched -- by more than 50 million Americans to date. That's voting with your eyeballs. And even if this presidential campaign has occasionally come too close to resembling a reality show, at least there is a core civic component beneath the conflict. The substance from the debates has driven the campaign news cycle. I understand that for campaign managers and some candidates, a schedule of debate after debate is a hassle that cuts into their fundraising time. They have to study up and learn policy, realizing that they'll get called out for repeating the kind of bumper-sticker lies they routinely get away with as part of their stump speech. But it's also the best chance to get their message to the widest number of people -- and that's what campaigns at their core are about. The fact that there is a risk involved in debates just reflects the real stakes of the race for the most powerful job on earth. Tuesday night's debate will be the last one for almost a month. February has a few scattered caucuses and primaries, but the next real prize is Super Tuesday in early March. And I expect that voters will miss the debates and the clarifying role they can play. Front-runners will want to avoid the accountability and scrutiny they provide, but it's a vital chance for voters to judge the candidates directly, adding light to the heat of the presidential primary gauntlet.

"London (CNN) -- British Home Secretary Theresa May sat down with officials from the social media industry Thursday, her office said, as the government considers trying to ban people from social networking during or after crises. But the government ""did not seek any additional powers to close down social media networks,"" the Home Office said. Twitter, Facebook, and BlackBerry maker Research in Motion all declined to say beforehand what position they would take at the meeting. Top police officers and other government officials were also present for the meeting, which follows riots that swept England earlier this month. Prime Minister David Cameron suggested limits on social networking in the wake of the unrest. He told Parliament August 11 that ""when people are using social media for violence, we need to stop them."" Thursday's meeting was about ""whether and how we should be able to stop people communicating via these websites and services when we know they are plotting violence, disorder and criminality,"" the Home Office said in a statement prior to the discussion. ""Social networking is not a cause of the recent disturbances but a means of enabling criminals to communicate,"" it said. ""We are working with the police to see what action can be taken to prevent access to those services by customers identified as perpetrators of disorder or other criminal action,"" the ministry said. Police and politicians have pointed to social networking sites, such as Twitter and Facebook, as well as mobile messaging services like BlackBerry's, as tools used to organize looting and violence. Two men have been sent to prison for posts on Facebook urging people to riot in northwest England. Cheshire Police named them as Jordan Blackshaw, 20, and Perry Sutcliffe-Keenan, 22, when they were sentenced last week. Neither of their Facebook posts resulted in any rioting, a Cheshire Police spokeswoman said. In handing down the sentence at Chester Crown Court, Judge Elgan Edwards said he hoped the sentence would serve as a deterrent to others. Cheshire Police Assistant Chief Constable Phil Thompson said ""technology was used to spread incitement and bring people together to commit acts of criminality,"" making it ""easy to understand the four-year sentences that were handed down in court."" The unrest, which was sparked by the shooting of a man in London August 6, led to widespread looting and damage. Five deaths have been linked to the violence. The Association of Chief Police Offices sent a representative to Thursday's meeting, it confirmed, but declined to give any other details, saying it was a private meeting. The group has not taken a position on whether people should be barred from social networking. London's Metropolitan Police also declined to say what its position would be at the meeting.

"London (CNN) -- Energy giant Total was trying Wednesday to contain a gas leak that forced the evacuation of a platform off the coast of Scotland. A union representing workers on the rig warned there was an ""urgent need"" to stop the leak, which began Sunday. ""If the gas cloud somehow finds an ignition source, we could be looking at complete destruction,"" said Jake Molloy, an official with the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers. ""This is an unprecedented situation and we really are in the realms of the unknown,"" Molloy said of the leak from the Elgin platform in the North Sea, about 150 miles (240 km) east of the Scottish city of Aberdeen. But oceanographer Simon Boxall said the risk of explosion may not be as high as initially feared. ""Initially the risk of explosion was seen as being very high. There were reports coming through of a large gas cloud enveloping the whole rig,"" he told CNN. But the fact that there has been no blast when the flare on the gas rig is still burning ""obviously contradicts the idea that there was a very high risk of explosion,"" he said. ""Perhaps the quantity of gas is not that great as first thought,"" he said. For the moment, the wind seems to be blowing the gas cloud away from the flare on the Elgin rig. Nearly 240 workers were taken off the rig as the problem developed Sunday, Total said in a statement. ""Investigations are ongoing to analyze the causes and to determine the remediation of the gas leak,"" the company said. Total confirmed there was a ""sheen on the water in the vicinity of the platform,"" but said there was no indication of environmental damage. There have been no injuries, the company said. Steve Todd, national shipping secretary for the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, said that while the workers were safely evacuated, they are being kept in the dark about what happened. More information is needed on what measures are being taken to prevent such a leak occurring again, he told CNN, speaking from Brussels, Belgium. ""We really need reassurances before anyone is put back out there that the danger has been cleared up altogether,"" he said. Shell partially evacuated two of its nearby platforms, Shearwater and Hans Deul, as a ""purely precautionary"" measure, it said. The Shearwater crew was reduced from 90 to 38, and the Hans Deul crew is in the process of being reduced from 106 to 38. Drilling was suspended on the Hans Deul rig, Shell UK said. The Elgin leak has echoes of the BP Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico, but there are significant differences. The Elgin is in significantly shallower water, which could make problems easier to fix, but it is leaking gas, rather than oil. Gas catches fire much more easily. ""This is nothing on the scale of the Gulf spill two years ago,"" Boxall said. ""This is a relatively light spill. The gas itself is dispersing quite rapidly."" But there is one parallel, he pointed out. ""Ironically, it sounds as if, just like with the Deepwater Horizon, they were closing off a well and somewhere along the line something went wrong,"" he said. ""The hope is that there is so little gas pressure in there that it will just blow itself out,"" he said of the Elgin spill. Failing that, Total may have to dig a bypass well to close off the leak from another angle, as BP did with the Gulf spill, he said. Any effect on the environment is likely to be strictly local, he predicted. Total's share price fell 7% Tuesday on news of the leak, but market analyst firm Jeffries International said Wednesday that it thought the market had overreacted. The company's value continued to fall on Wednesday, but not as sharply. It was down about 1% from the day before as of Wednesday afternoon in France, where it is traded. The North Sea was the scene of the world's worst offshore rig disaster, the Piper Alpha explosion, which killed 167 people in 1988.","NEW: Workers need to know what happened before anyone returns to the rig -- union leader .

"Washington (CNN) -- A member of the U.S. military assigned to the White House Communications Agency is under investigation in connection with alleged misconduct in Colombia, bringing to 12 the total number of military personnel being reviewed, officials said Monday. One Defense Department official said the military member admitted to his leadership that he was involved in misconduct ""of some kind"" while in Colombia for the recent Summit of the Americas attended by President Barack Obama. The agency is a non-White House office that provides the president with secure communications while he travels. It is staffed by members of the military who report through the Defense Information Systems Agency. A total of 24 people -- 12 Secret Service members and 12 U.S. military members -- are under investigation in the alleged prostitution scandal that occurred before Obama arrived in Cartagena on April 13. The controversy has embarrassed the nearly 150-year-old Secret Service, which protects the president and other top officials and investigates criminal activity, and raised questions about a possible security breach immediately preceding Obama's visit. Six Secret Service members have left their jobs in the wake of the incident in Cartagena, and one employee ""has been cleared of serious misconduct but will face administrative action,"" the Secret Service said. Five other Secret Service employees are on administrative leave and have had their security clearances temporarily revoked. In addition, the U.S. military is investigating 12 of its own service members for alleged misconduct. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Monday that security clearances have been suspended for all U.S. military personnel involved in the incident in Cartagena, and he repeated his vow that anyone found to have violated regulations would be punished. ""We expect our people wherever they are, whether they're in Colombia or any other country or in the United States, to behave at the highest standards of conduct,"" Panetta said during a visit to the Colombian capital Bogota. ""That's what we expect. And so we will wait for the investigation that is currently taking place."" At the White House, Press Secretary Jay Carney said Monday that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by White House staff or advance team members. When asked about the possibility of White House Communications Agency staff members being involved, Carney pointed out that they are members of the military. ""To make clear, the Secret Service is investigating specific allegations of misconduct by members of the Secret Service. The Defense Department is investigating specific allegations of misconduct by members of the military,"" he said. ""There have been no specific, credible allegations of misconduct by anyone on the White House advance team or the White House staff. ""Nevertheless, out of due diligence, the White House counsel's office has conducted a review of the White House advance team, and in concluding that review, came to the conclusion that there's no indication that any member of the White House advance team engaged in any improper conduct or behavior."" That drew the attention of Sen. Charles Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. In a letter to the counsel's office, Grassley noted that he had asked Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan whether any White House advance staff had been involved and hadn't had an answer back by Monday. Grassley asked for answers to 14 questions, including details of how the White House review was conducted, whether any White House staffers had ""overnight guests"" and whether any additional room charges were incurred. Also Monday, a source familiar with the investigation said that one of the Secret Service agents linked to the prostitution scandal brought a woman back to the Hilton Cartagena, the same hotel where Obama later stayed, five days before the president's arrival. The source was not certain whether money exchanged hands or whether the Secret Service member simply brought a woman he met -- a foreign national -- to the Hilton. According to the source, the incident appeared to be separate from the one a few nights later that caused 11 other Secret Service members to be sent home for alleged heavy drinking and consorting with prostitutes. Based on the investigation, there is no evidence that the women realized the Secret Service personnel were with the agency, the source said. Investigators have interviewed the prostitutes and other women involved. ""It doesn't appear these women knew who the heck they were,"" the source said. Meanwhile, House Homeland Security Chairman Peter King said he expects more Secret Service members to be forced out soon. ""I am very certain that within the next day or so, you're going to see a number of people leaving the Secret Service,"" said King, R-New York. King, as well as the other source familiar with the investigation, said polygraph tests administered to the Secret Service members helped get information to force out six of them. According to King, the 11 Secret Service members originally under investigation were all given drug tests, which came back negative. From the start, Sullivan told legislators how outraged he was about the scandal, promising a broad and comprehensive investigation. Most legislators seemed comfortable with the way the Secret Service has reacted to the scandal. However, both the House and Senate Homeland Security Committee chairmen are now conducting their own investigations and will probably hold hearings in coming weeks. The 11 Secret Service employees accused of consorting with prostitutes arrived earlier the same day as a part of the ""jump team"" that flies in on military transport planes with vehicles in the president's motorcade. According to sources, the alleged prostitutes -- the youngest of whom were in their early 20s -- signed in at the Cartagena hotel where Secret Service members apparently stayed, flashing their local ID cards. One of these women allegedly was later involved in a dispute about how much she was to be paid for the night, which brought the entire incident to light and sparked controversy in the United States and Colombia. That woman has been identified as Dania Suarez, whose neighbors described her as a 24-year-old single mother who studies English. Suarez hasn't been seen in the neighborhood since the controversy erupted, though a visitor took suitcases from the house recently, they said. While soliciting prostitution is in most cases legal for adults in Colombia, military law bars service members from patronizing prostitutes, engaging in conduct unbecoming an officer or, for enlisted personnel, conduct ""prejudicial to good order and discipline."" It is also considered a breach of the Secret Service's conduct code, government sources said. CNN's Drew Griffin and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","NEW: Panetta says service members must meet the ""highest standards of conduct""

"(CNN)  -- The Bahrain Grand Prix will not go ahead after organizers said Friday that they had abandoned plans to re-schedule the race later this year. Bahrain were to host the opening race of the 2011 Formula One season on March 13, but it was postponed on February 21 after civil unrest in the gulf kingdom. Last week, the World Motor Sport Council re-instated the race and gave it a provisional date of October 30. The decision drew widespread criticism and former FIA president Max Mosley told CNN Tuesday that he would be ""astonished"" if the race proceeded. Red Bull driver Mark Webber also weighed in, telling his official website:""I'll be highly surprised if the Bahrain Grand Prix goes ahead this year."" The Formula One Teams Association also confirmed to CNN Tuesday that they had written to world governing body the FIA, Formula One commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone and the Bahrain International Circuit to express their views on the issue. The Bahrain circuit's chairman Zayed R Alzayani confirmed their decision in a statement on their official website Friday. It read: ""Whilst Bahrain would have been delighted to see the grand prix progress on October 30th in-line with the World Motor Sport Council's decision, it has been made clear that this fixture cannot progress and we fully respect that decision. ""Bahrain has absolutely no desire to see a race which would further extend the calendar season detract from the enjoyment of F1 for either drivers, teams or supporters,"" he said. The inaugural Indian Grand Prix, scheduled for the October 30 slot at a new circuit on the outskirts of New Delhi, was set to be pushed back to December but can now go ahead on its original date. About 30 people have died during protests in Bahrain, according to figures from the government, opposition figures and human rights groups. Opposition and human rights groups say the government has detained more than 1,000 people. A state of emergency was lifted last week and Bahrain Grand Prix organizers remain hopeful that they can stage a race in 2011. ""We look forward to welcoming teams, their drivers and supporters back to Bahrain next year,"" read the statement.","Bahrain Grand Prix organizers abandon plans to stage a race this year .

"(CNN) -- On a recent visit to Barcelona, Spain, my local translator, who told me he was becoming increasingly interested in physics as he listened to my responses to reporters' questions, commented that he couldn't believe the biggest advances in my field will come not from America but from Europe -- for him, an unexpected turn. The Large Hadron Collider, the enormous machine that collides protons to study matter at higher energies and shorter distances than ever is in Europe (near Geneva, Switzerland) and not in America, where most important particle physics discoveries have taken place in the past. The European community has remained steadfastly supportive of this international enterprise and, unlike America of late, recognizes the importance of maintaining its scientific commitments. If current political discussions are any indication, America is in danger not only of losing scientific leadership but also of losing respect for the scientific method itself. This is at a time when the type of clear and rational thinking that science teaches us is more relevant than ever. Given the challenging problems we face today, our country needs to embrace the scientific values that have served us so well. Much of our economy, from the ever-tinier and more powerful products of our electronics industry to the most cost-effective manufacturing processes to the latest marketing and advertising tactics, has emerged from scientific advances and reasoning. So have many sensible government policies and programs, even if they are often also politically compromised. Science features prominently in many current debates, including those over climate change, searches for alternative energy sources and progress in medical care. But other issues that aren't strictly scientific also involve the big numbers and complicated interwoven decisions for which scientific thinking can help. Yes science is difficult and some people feel disempowered by how much we need to understand. But so are such challenges as establishing stability in the Middle East, fixing the economy, restoring job growth and ensuring financial stability. The scientific method lets us see how various policies have fared elsewhere (through observation and experiment) and in other cases we can anticipate the expected results of various policies. Of course political factors enter, too, in policy debates in which actual scientific facts don't necessarily dominate the decision-making process. But in all cases, having a logical framework with which to move forward makes sense. Science gives us a systematic way of incorporating what we know and don't know into a consistent logical framework. It doesn't say we know all the answers, but it does tell us the likelihood of particular outcomes and how well we can trust our predictions. At particle colliders, we know that if certain theories are correct, certain particles should appear a given fraction of the time and we can determine how many collisions we would need for a signal of new phenomena to emerge. When we decide on regulations, we have to estimate the likely cost of damages and the likely benefits of providing new rules. Scientists carefully consider the questions we ask, the uncertainties in our assumptions and the precision of our results. Even though science can be good for all of us, scientific issues in America have taken on political overtones. As Jon Stewart asked me on the Daily Show, why do people resist science and why are scientists accused of working for the Democrats, or either party for that matter? The answer I gave then is probably indeed one way to understand the problem. Science is difficult in many cases. The shortcut to presenting reasoned arguments is to present the conclusions of scientists rather than the detailed logic and reasoning that went into their decisions. Debates become ""he said, she said"" (actually more often ""he said, he said""). Not only does this distort the balance of what people really think --- rarely do both opinions carry equal weight -- but even worse, personalizing the arguments becomes a shortcut for describing the issues themselves. That leaves science and facts open to politicization that presenting actual facts can potentially avert. Part of being a good scientist is the ability to find answerable questions, hopefully ones that shed light on larger, more difficult problems. I recently heard a leading economist compare financial crises to avalanches, the idea being that avalanches are the result of small pressures building up to massive instabilities that are difficult to predict. A scientist who worries about avalanches (or any mountain guide worth their fee) would know the indicators of avalanches, the slope and type of snow, and would furthermore know how to check for danger before heading down a slope. They would also recognize a slope that is likely to fail, even if they can't say exactly when. In the case of markets, a scientific way of thinking would also involve trying to find indicators of problems and tests that predict (based on experimental data) when situations are likely to get out of hand. Scientists don't just throw up their hands and say a problem is too difficult. They look for inroads, while at the same time acknowledging the potential limitations of their results. Though scientists rely on expert opinions, the opinion of any scientist, no matter how important, ultimately has to be verified through facts. Everyone who is interested is free to examine data or evaluate ideas. A promising direction or an objection to existing suggestions will ultimately be heard. The key currency in science is reputation. Scientists know they have to pay attention to both good ideas and to objections, because science is unforgiving. Golden parachutes don't exist. Presented with mounting debt and budget shortfalls, we now hear proposals to cut America's investment in education, infrastructure, science and technology. But that is like dealing with a water shortage by cutting the roots out of trees. Yes the water is more obviously needed for the dry brittle branches, but nothing will survive if we cut off the source. I'm encouraged in an odd sort of way by the e-mails I get and the interviews I've had with people whose political affiliations are at opposite poles from mine. Despite what we might hear and what politicians might say, science is not just the domain of a liberal elite. It's encouraging to get mail from someone who is hopeful his daughters learn science, even if he subsequently put me on his tea party mailing list. Science and the scientific method are part of progress. With science we don't always know where results will take us. No one knew electricity would change the face of the planet when it was discovered or that quantum mechanics would lead to the electronics revolution. But a scientifically advanced society values progress and education, and is prepared to think rationally about the issues we face. The arguments might be more subtle and some people might be resistant at first. But if policymakers show they believe what scientific results say, even those who are skeptical or afraid might come around. They shouldn't be ashamed of employing science, they should be proud of it. And the electorate, if they are concerned about our future, should start demanding they do so.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Eight Ferraris, three Mercedes-Benz cars and a Lamborghini have crashed in a massive -- and very expensive -- 14-vehicle accident in southwestern Japan. The wreck took place Sunday on Chugoku Expressway in Shimonoseki, according to Yamaguchi prefectural police. One of the Ferraris skidded and collided into the central divider, setting off a chain-reaction crash. Police said some of the drivers belonged to a group of luxury car enthusiasts from Kyushu island who had gathered to tour the area together. While most of the 14 vehicles -- which also included two Toyotas -- were traveling in the same direction, a Mercedes CL600 headed in the opposite direction was hit by flying parts from the other side of the expressway. Ten drivers were hospitalized, but no one was seriously injured, police said. Witnesses told CNN affiliate TV Asahi that they saw a car speeding on the road, which was wet from recent rain.","The 14-vehicle crash also includes 3 Mercedes-Benz cars and 2 Toyotas .

"(CNN) -- The Bahrain Grand Prix has been reinstated to the 2011 Formula One calendar after unrest in the Gulf kingdom forced its cancellation earlier in the year, officials announced Friday. The race, which had been scheduled to be the opening race of the elite motorsport season on March 13, was canceled in February. The Bahraini crown prince informed F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone of the decision by telephone after days of violent clashes. Australia subsequently hosted the opening event two weeks later than scheduled. The race in Bahrain is now scheduled for October 28-30, meaning that the inaugural Indian Grand Prix will be shifted from that date to become the final race of the season after Brazil (November 25-27). The Indian event will now take place on December 9-11, according to the official F1 web site. Should F1 take the risk of racing in Bahrain? ""This is welcome news for all of Bahrain,"" chairman of the host circuit Zayed R. Alzayani said in a statement Friday. ""As a country we have faced a difficult time, but stability has returned; with businesses operating close to normal, the State of National Safety lifted and countries removing travel restrictions. ""Collectively, we are in the process of addressing issues of national and international concern, and learning lessons from the recent past. By the time the Grand Prix arrives we will be able to remind the world about Bahrain at its best."" Alzayani said the race ""attracts 100,000 visitors, supports 3,000 jobs and generates around $500 million of economic benefit. Its positive effect will be felt throughout the country."" Ecclestone's Formula One Management and motorsport's world governing body, the FIA, confirmed the announcement on Friday. FIA president Jean Todt and vice-president Carlos Garcia visited Bahrain on Tuesday to assess the situation, meeting government and motor racing officials as well as as other national and international organizations including the National Institute of Human Rights. ""It should be noted that the recent announcement by the King of Bahrain has established a political dialogue and reconciliation process,"" the FIA said in a statement on its web site. ""After considering all the factors and taking into consideration all stakeholders' concerns, the World Motor Sport Council (WMSC) unanimously agreed to reinstate the Bahrain Grand Prix."" However, the news has been cautiously received by leading team Red Bull, which won both driver and manufacturer world titles last season and is again on top in 2011 with Sebastian Vettel a dominant force on the grid. ""Red Bull Racing has acknowledged the FIA World Motor Sport Council's decision to go ahead with the 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix,"" the Britain-based Austrian team said in a statement. ""We will go through the correct channels and discuss this decision within the appropriate forum with the other F1 teams and our fellow FOTA members."" Red Bull has been targeted by activist group Avaaz, which launched an online petition asking the team and the 11 others in F1 to boycott Bahrain. ""Formula One's decision is a kick in the teeth for the Bahraini people,"" campaign director Alex Wilks said in quotes reported by the UK Press Association, which said former F1 world champion Damon Hill was among the 340,000-plus signatories. The Bahrain Center for Human Rights also expressed its anger at the FIA's decision, and warned that there would be further protests on the day of the race. ""They have taken the decision on the day two people were buried today: one woman who died from shock from a sound bomb, and one man who died today after being attacked in March,"" its president Nabeel Rajab told CNN. ""That F1 took this decision without thinking about the human rights in this country, this shows to many organizations that their interests have more value to them than humanity. ""From our side we will see how on that day we will get the whole world to know what is happening here. Already there are pages on Facebook calling it (the day of the grand prix) a Day of Rage. ""I will urge all the drivers, journalists, everyone, to stay in solidarity with us by not going to this event. This will be the sport of the oppressor's regime. A huge number of the staff of F1 Bahrain has been detained, jailed and tortured. None of this is reported."" On Wednesday, Bahrain lifted the state of emergency laws that had facilitated the restriction of political leaders and journalists, but at the same time the government continued its crackdown on the country's major Shiite political opposition movement and stifled the latest street protests. It filed charges against four top opposition leaders in a move that could weaken the country's Al Wefaq party, according to two opposition sources. This came as King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa appealed for dialogue, saying that talks with opposition groups are scheduled to begin in July. The lifting of the emergency laws, imposed in mid-March, is thought to be an effort to signal an end to months of civil unrest stemming from the Arab Spring, a wave of anti-government demonstrations that started in Tunisia and have since roiled several countries in the Middle East and North Africa, including Egypt, Syria, Yemen and Bahrain. But the announcement by the country's Information Affairs Authority followed one from the justice ministry the day before warning against ""any type of activities that could affect the security or harm the national peace and safety."" Still, Alzayani on Friday said: ""The Bahrain Grand Prix has always been a source of national pride and it is an event than transcends politics. Not only does it receive strong support from the Government, but also from all major parties in Bahrain, including our largest opposition group, Al Wefaq, who yesterday endorsed both the BIC and motor-racing in Bahrain.""","Race, scheduled to launch the F1 season, was canceled in February over unrest .

"(CNN) -- Blaming the moon is a popular pastime. Police say crime rates go up during a full moon, nurses claim birth rates go up, authors set werewolves and vampires loose upon the land, and people think craziness abounds -- witness the word ""lunatic,"" which derives from ""luna,"" the Latin word for moon. None of this moon-linked strangeness has ever stood up to serious scrutiny. But now a team of astronomers at Texas State University-San Marcos has suggested that the moon can be blamed for the sinking of the Titanic on its maiden voyage 100 years ago. How the moon caused icebergs to litter the Titanic's path, on April 14, 1912, is really a story about the Earth's tides. What we now know about where icebergs originate and how they travel could have informed the Titanic's crew and perhaps avoided tragedy. But at the time, this science was in its infancy. The Titanic's captain did not expect icebergs to be a problem -- rarely did ice travel so far south into the Atlantic. Yet contemporaneous warnings from other ships suggested there were an unusual number of icebergs. Passengers reported seeing ice floes, lookouts spotted ice and sounded warnings, and other ships in the area reported fields of ice near the disaster site. Here's where astronomy comes in: Three months earlier, on January 4, 1912, the closest approach of the moon to the Earth in 1,400 years occurred within one day of the Earth's closest approach to the sun (which occurs once per year), all within minutes of a full moon, meaning the sun was perfectly aligned on the other side of the Earth (this happens every couple of weeks). The odds of all three events occurring at once are, well, astronomical. This lineup had to have caused unusually high tides in the North Atlantic. Tides are caused mostly by the differential pull of the moon's gravity on the Earth. The pull is strongest on the near side and weakest on the far side, since the strength of gravity, as Isaac Newton told us four centuries ago, falls as the square of the distance between the two massive objects -- in this case, the Earth and the moon. That is, the moon pulls hardest on the Earth's oceans on the side facing the moon, making a bulge of water (high tide). It pulls less hard on the Earth, but even less hard on the water on the far side, so a watery bulge forms on the far side as well -- a high tide roughly 12 hours out of synch. The overall strength of the moon's gravity, as well as its differential (tidal) effect, is greatest when the moon is closest to the Earth, as on January 4, 1912. Now consider the sun. It is much more massive than the moon or Earth but also much farther away. The absolute pull of the sun's gravity is far greater than the pull of the moon -- that's why we're orbiting the sun, after all, rather than the moon -- but the sun does not exert much of a tidal force on the Earth (that is, a stronger force on the Earth's near side than its far side) because, compared to the distance between the sun and Earth, the Earth's size is miniscule. Try this analogy (thanks to Veritasium.com): if the Earth were the size of a basketball, the moon would be a tennis ball about 24 feet away, and the Sun would be like a house nearly two miles away. To the sun, the Earth is a tiny speck: its diameter is less than 0.01% of the Earth-sun distance. But the size of the Earth is a few percent of the distance to the moon, which translates to about a 7% stronger gravitational pull on the near side of the Earth than the far side. That's why the moon dominates the Earth's tides. Still, when the sun lines up perfectly on the opposite side of the Earth from the moon, as it did on January 4, 1912, it increases the tidal effect slightly. And the fact that the sun and moon were particularly close to the Earth at precisely the same time -- well, that made the tidal bulges even bigger. What does this have to do with icebergs? The University of Texas scientists pointed out that normally, icebergs move south from Greenland in fits and starts, frequently grounding in the shallow waters off Labrador and Newfoundland. But unusually high tides in January 1912 meant the icebergs didn't get stuck. Instead, they kept moving south, arriving in much greater numbers than usual in the path of the Titanic. Maybe the Titanic's captain had reason to believe reports of excessive ice were wrong -- such conditions were, after all, not the norm. But he didn't reckon on the inexorable pull of gravity from Earth's nearest celestial neighbor. This is the real lunar influence on our lives: gravity and tides, not werewolves and pregnant women. One thing this new theory predicts: There should be records of exceptionally high tides near Newfoundland and Labrador in January 1912. This is the hallmark of a proper theory: it makes predictions that can then be tested. So, history buffs, marine historians, tell us: Does this theory hold water? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Meg Urry.","A study by astronomers says the moon's position may have had a role in Titanic sinking .
Meg Urry: An unusual lineup of the Earth, sun, moon in January 1912 would have boosted tide .
She says higher tides could have floated icebergs into the route of the oceanliner .
Urry: If theory is true, there should be evidence of extreme high tide ."
"(CNN) -- Colombian rebels are prepared to release 10 hostages on Monday and Wednesday, officials said. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, had announced the impending release of the 10 -- the last of the government hostages they hold -- in February, and since then has been negotiating details of the release. Monday and Wednesday have been designated as the two days for the hostage releases, said Jordi Raich, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross delegation. ""We know the families and the loved ones of all these people have been waiting for so long: 12, 13, 14 years, and now is a very difficult moment, a moment of nervousness,"" he said. ""Our main message to them is to be patient for two or three more days because this is an extremely complex operation where many people are involved and the key point of it all is to do it in a safe way, security is an extremely important to us."" Brazilian helicopters will arrive in Colombia on Sunday and will be used in the operation, he said. Support from the Red Cross will not end with the reuniting of the hostages with their families, Raich said. Psychological support, both for the families and the hostages who have been captive in the jungle for more than a decade, is very important, he said. The story doesn't end with the hostages' release because ""after so many years of separation, there is still a lot to do to help them overcome the trauma of this period of time that they have not been together, without news, to help them reintegrating into society,"" he said. The leftist rebels have been at war with the Colombian government since the 1960s. While severely weakened in recent years, the group has continued to carry out kidnappings and attack security forces. In February, the FARC announced that it was releasing the hostages, and would stop kidnapping civilians for money. It did not address the fate of its civilian captives, nor did the group renounce kidnapping for political purposes. CNN's Luisa Calad and journalist Toby Muse contributed to this report.","The FARC announced in February that it would release 10 hostages .
The 10 are the last of the goverment hostages held by FARC .
Monday and Wednesday have been set as the dates for their release .

"(CNN) -- Juventus maintained a three-point lead at the top of Serie A with a convincing 4-0 win at Novara on Sunday to stay on course for a first league title in nine years. Two goals from Mirko Vucinic and one a piece for Marco Borriello and Arturo Vidal earned Juventus their eighth straight win and takes their league tally to 77 points with three matches remaining. ""Three days ago Novara beat Lazio so we knew it wouldn't be easy but we got the early goal and we kept our concentration right until the end,"" Juventus coach, Antonio Conte said. ""We are getting closer and we are the masters of our own destiny. The squad has gone from strength to strength, driven by a great desire for success,"" Conte added. Novara, meanwhile, remain mired in relegation troubles -- second-from bottom and still eight points adrift of safety. Juventus' nearest rivals AC Milan kept up the pressure with a 4-1 at Siena. Antonio Cassano opened the scoring in the 26th minute -- his first goal since returning from heart surgery in November -- with Zlatan Ibrahimovic netting three minutes later. Albanian striker Erjon Bogdani halved the deficit for Siena in the 83rd minute but Milan made sure of three points with two late goals. The first came from Antonio Nocerino in the 89th minute before Ibrahimovic bagged his second of the game and his 26th league goal of the season. Milan coach Massimiliano Allegri has not yet given up hope of the Rossoneri regaining the title they won 12 months ago. ""We will try to push until the end but if they finish ahead of us then they deserve to win. We don't want to be finish many points behind Juventus. In two years we've won a league and a Super Cup and been competitive in the Champions League,"" Allegri said. Fifth-placed Inter Milan beat already relegated Cesena 2-1 in the San Siro to draw level on 55 points with Napoli and Lazio as the three teams battle for the third Champions League place. Luca Ceccarelli put Cesena ahead in the 57th minute but Nigerian midfielder Joel Obi equalized two minutes later before substitute Mauro Zarate scored the Nerazzurri's winner in the 72nd minute. In other matches, mid-table Atalanta climbed to ninth with a 2-0 win over 16th-placed Fiorentina. Genoa remain one place and one point above the relegation zone after a 3-2 defeat at Bologna. Third-from-bottom Lecce also lost going down 2-1 at home to Parma.","Juventus beat 4-0 to remain three points clear at the top of Serie A .

"(CNN) -- I met Whitney Houston after the debut of her first self-titled album on Arista Records. She was poised, graceful and strong. She was also sweet and laughed easily. This seems unremarkable today other than the fact that strong women were not exactly well-supported in those days in the music business. As in other professions when a female artist was successful, she was often accused of being demanding and diva-like even when all she sought was the same respect or artistic license that men of their stature received. So Whitney's decency was noticed and her joy for singing was infectious. Her mother, Cissy Houston, hovered and I suspect had a lot to do with her staying grounded for as long as she did. Whitney's voice soared. When she sang, our emotions rose and fell with her projection. Her articulation of lyrics combined with a smoothness in her timbre created one of the greatest musical voices of all time. As with many famous people, the celebrity she achieved came with public attention beyond imagination -- and some of it wasn't always very kind. She was criticized after her first two albums for not being ""black enough."" Her ballads were attacked for lacking rhythm. Clive Davis, her mentor and executive producer, was accused of trying to keep her ""white."" It was all nonsense of course, but I am certain it was painful. I vividly recall sitting next to a star who once had fame approximating Whitney's but whose revenues were clearly on the downswing, speaking loudly to the rest of her table about how awful and lucky Whitney was and how she didn't deserve her fame. Gene Seymour: Whitney Houston, special from the start . The jealously and vitriol were significant. At the same time, the adulation of her fans around the world was huge. Expectations for her were very high. As an African-American global superstar, she made a real difference in so many important causes. She lent her stature to the anti-apartheid movement, to the response to the AIDS crisis and to the need for better educational opportunities for young black men and women. But no matter what she did, people always wanted more -- as we do of all stars. The public demand facing our celebrities is unrelenting. Of course, I don't know what drove her to drugs in the beginning, but drowning out the intensity around her was surely one of the side effects she came to depend upon. And of course, then there is addiction. As experts know, no matter how much consciousness you develop about your drug habit and no matter how much you want to quit, the chemical attraction is incredibly powerful and beckons over and over again. When sobriety makes apparent the reality of a disappointing showing at the box office, a failed new single or a harsh critical review, the failure that most of us bear in private is splashed on every media page in the world for all to see. For some artists, their talent is a precious gift, and they honor it by loving and taking care of themselves. For others, it becomes a burden. My favorite Whitney song is ""The Greatest Love of All,"" a rousing anthem to learning to love yourself. It breaks my heart that the woman who inspired so much pride with this song suffered so much from her own demons. Like Billie Holiday, Judy Garland, Elvis and others before her, that inner voice of doubt that we all feel sometimes just could never keep up with the public adulation. And so the only answer in the moment that makes sense is to drown out the external praise and dull the doubt with drugs and alcohol. By many accounts from those close to her, she understood the dangers even as she was too often powerless to change. And she raised a wonderful daughter despite her troubles. That says so much about her determination to beat her addiction. I wish that our intense media culture allowed more space for celebrating the positives about people while they are alive and struggling. Whitney Houston's music legacy will be an inspiration to young artists for years to come. Without taking one thing away from her amazing talent and my total and complete admiration for her career, I hope her troubled life in the spotlight will also serve as the right warning as well.

"(CNN) -- The exiled leader of the Palestinian Islamic faction Hamas met with Jordan's King Abdullah II on Sunday in his first official trip to Jordan since his expulsion in 1999. In a statement issued by Hamas, Khaled Meshaal expressed his appreciation to the king for supporting Palestinians. ""Any future meetings between Hamas and Jordan open a new page between the two sides and serve the Palestinian cause,"" said Meshaal, who announced earlier this month that he would not seek another term as president of the movement's governing body. The meeting comes as Abdullah is making a high-profile attempt to broker new peace talks in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Hamas, which the United States and the European Union consider a terrorist organization, controls the Palestinian territory of Gaza and refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist. Meshaal met with Abdullah and the crown prince of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, Jordan's state news agency Petra reported. Abdullah reaffirmed his support for a Palestinian state based on the borders drawn before the 1967 Middle East war, ""with East Jerusalem as its capital,"" Petra reported. Israel claims all of Jerusalem as its own capital, and its ultimate status is one of the most contentious points in the talks. But Abdullah also called negotiations ""the sole means to regain Palestinian rights,"" a stance Israel and the United States have supported as Palestinian leaders seek recognition of an independent Palestine at the United Nations. And Petra said Meshaal called the meetings ""a new opening"" after 12 years, stating Hamas respected ""Jordan's security, stability and interests."" Jordan kicked the leadership of Hamas out of the country in 1999 after accusing it of breaking a deal to restrict its activity to politics. The movement has maintained a headquarters in Syria's capital Damascus since then, receiving financial and military support from the governments of Hafez al-Assad and his successor, his son Bashar. But Hamas has been distancing itself from its long-time patron as Syria battles a 10-month-old popular uprising against al-Assad. Hamas personnel and their families have left Syria in recent weeks, and Ismail Haniya, the Hamas leader in Gaza, did not stop in Damascus during a recent regional trip. Abdullah, meanwhile, told CNN during a recent visit to Washington that he was stepping up to try to restart the stalled Israeli-Palestinian talks. He said his message to President Barack Obama was, ""It's up to us to do the heavy lifting ... We can't always have to fall back on the United States to do everything."" But Israel and the Palestinian Authority, which controls the West Bank, spent Sunday blaming each other for the latest lack of progress. Speaking at the start of his weekly Cabinet meeting, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Palestinians ""refused to even discuss Israel's security needs with us"" in the most recent contacts in Amman. ""Signs are not particularly good,"" Netanyahu said in comments released by his office. ""But I hope that they will come to their senses and continue with the talks in order for us to advance to true negotiations."" But Palestinians have blamed Israel's ongoing construction of settlements in the West Bank, on land the Palestinians consider part of their future state, for the impasse. Senior Palestinian negotiator Mohammad Shtayeh told CNN that the Palestinians presented Israel, Jordan and members of the Mideast Quartet powers with a written document on security and border issues, ""and the Israeli side did not present anything in writing as the Quartet requested."" ""The Amman talks were about creating a conducive environment for any future talks,"" Shtayeh said. ""But, unfortunately, Israel did not accept to freeze settlement construction, which we consider as destroying confidence measures and an illegal and provocative act which led to the collapse of the talks."" Shtayeh said the Palestinian leadership ""will consult with the Arab countries as will re-evaluate the situation with King of Jordan, and upon all of these consultations we will reach a decision on where to go.""","Khaled Meshaal meets with King Abdullah II in Amman .

"(CNN) -- An Oklahoma judge entered not guilty pleas Monday for two men accused of killing three people in a shooting spree in a predominately African-American neighborhood in Tulsa this month, according to an attorney for one of the suspects. Jake England and Alvin Watts face murder and hate crime charges in connection with the April 6 shootings that also left two people wounded. They appeared before a judge via a video link from jail to hear the charges against them, said Clark Brewster, England's attorney. Neither of the men, who are being held without bond, spoke. Watts was assigned a public defender, Brewster said. A preliminary hearing was scheduled for May 30. Authorities say England and Watts went into a largely African-American section of Tulsa shortly after midnight and gunned down apparent strangers at four locations. Two men and one woman died after being shot in the chest, while two others were shot and survived. All the shooting victims are black. Police have identified Watts and England as white, though a probable cause affidavit released Friday noted England was co-owner of a truck that had Cherokee Nation license plates. England confessed to shooting three people, while Watts admitted to police that he shot the other two, both of them fatally, according to police documents. On Friday, Tulsa County District Attorney Tim Harris filed, against both men, three counts of first-degree murder tied to the deaths of Bobby Clark, 54, Dannaer Fields, 49, and William Terrell Allen, 31. They also face two counts of shooting with intent to kill related to the two people who were wounded, according to the press release from the district attorney's office. In addition, the men face five counts of malicious harassment. The district attorney notes that, according to Oklahoma law, that charge infers that a person has acted ""maliciously and with the specific intent to intimidate or harass another person because of that person's race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin or disability."" The charge is equivalent to a hate crime under Oklahoma law, according to Partners Against Hate, a joint project of the Anti-Defamation League, the Leadership Conference Education Fund and the Center for Preventing Hate nonprofit groups. If found guilty on the murder charges, England and Watts could be sentenced to death or to life in prison. The maximum sentence for each charge of shooting with intent to kill is life in prison. First Assistant District Attorney Doug Drummond said in a press release that the prosecution is likely to decide whether to seek the death penalty after the preliminary hearing is complete. CNN's Carma Hassan contributed to this report.","Jake England and Alvin Watts face murder and hate crime charges .

"(CNN) -- Formula One legend Michael Schumacher has admitted his relief after visiting stricken Ferrari driver Felipe Massa in hospital. Michael Schumacher will make a dramatic return to Formula One as a replacement for Felipe Massa. The seven-time world champion has agreed to come out of retirement to replace Massa in the short term following the Brazilian's freak accident in Hungary which left him fighting for his life. The 40-year-old had not previously had the time to visit Massa, last year's world championship runner-up, as he has been undergoing medical tests and getting up to speed for his eagerly-anticipated racing return by practicing in a 2007 Ferrari. He told his personal Web site that he felt better after actually seeing Massa -- who is managed by Nicolas Todt, son of former Ferrari team boss Jean -- at Budapest's AEK hospital. ""Good that I finally made it to see Felipe, I feel better now. Even if I was in close contact with him via Nicolas and Jean and informed about everything, it still is better to see it with your own eyes,"" Schumacher said on Saturday. ""I am surprised at his extreme positive condition, as the accident was only one week ago. We sat together for around three hours and were chatting with each other. I really feel relieved now.""   Felipe Massa's crash in pictures. » . Schumacher said that he was tired and sore after Friday's sessions in the old Ferrari -- he is not allowed to drive a current model due to the testing ban this season. ""I have to say that today I feel muscles I was not even aware anymore that they exist,"" he said. ""But then it was clear that you cannot test for a day after such a lot of time without feeling anything, and I am curious to see what will happen in the coming days."" Massa is expected to return home on Monday, just nine days after fracturing his skull in a freak accident during qualifying at the Hungarian Grand Prix. He is continuing to make a good recovery after having emergency surgery for life-threatening injuries he sustained after being struck full on the helmet by a suspension spring that had fallen off the Brawn of fellow Brazilian Rubens Barrichello. He was knocked unconscious and his car hurtled into a tire barrier at 200kph in the final qualifying for Sunday's race which was won by Lewis Hamilton, who pipped Massa to the world title last season. Operated on at the AEK military hospital in Budapest, Massa spent two days in a medically-induced coma, but since coming around has improved rapidly. His personal doctor, Dino Altmann, told reporters Friday that Massa had made rapid strides. ""He is doing very well, and we have already decided to go back home on Monday to Sao Paulo."" Altmann said he would complete his recuperation at home rather than returning to Europe. ""He is to continue his recovery and return to racing as soon as possible, that's the plan,"" added Altmann. Early fears that Massa may have lost some sight in his left eye as a result of the accident appear to have receded, but he will be replaced at the European Grand Prix in Valencia in three weeks' time by Schumacher.","NEW: Michael Schumacher is relieved after visiting Felipe Massa in hospital .

"(CNN) -- Another musical titan whose soaring voice ruled the charts for decades has fallen. Whitney Houston joins an august list of the departed since Michael Jackson's death nearly three years ago. ""First there was MJ, then there was Heavy D and now Whitney,"" said Shaun Jones, 47, of Titusville, Florida, adding that he jumped out of bed in disbelief when he heard news of Houston's death. Rapper Heavy D died last year, as did Nick Ashford, who was one half of the Motown duo Ashford and Simpson. And in late 2010, singer Mary Christine Brockert, better known by her stage name Teena Marie, died in her sleep. ""It's shocking ... all these people are legends. A lot of them are dying too young. It's crazy."" Pop icons such as Houston enjoyed staggering success through the 1980s and into the 1990s, and served as role models to a generation of singers today. Announcements about their deaths are always almost followed by tributes from younger pop stars acknowledging how much influence they've had on their careers. ""Icons from that era stood out,"" Jones said. ""They had distinct voices -- I can always tell when a song is by Whitney -- they made music back then."" Houston was a ""hero for Gen X black girls,"" said CNN iReporter Tessa Jackson of New Orleans. She said when she was ""a black teenager going to a predominantly white high school in California, Whitney was my style icon and hero ... She made me and other girls like me feel like we didn't have to be blonde and blue-eyed to be beautiful and admired. I wish she knew how much she did for my and my friends' self-esteem."" Stunned celebrities who gathered for pre-Grammy festivities in Los Angeles expressed their shock Saturday night as fans worldwide paid tribute to the singer whose music spanned borders and generations. ""I remember dedicating some Whitney songs while writing letters to girls in my high school,"" said Mark Keith Muhumuza, who lives in Kampala, Uganda. The 26-year-old said his favorites included ""The Greatest Love of All"" and ""I Will Always Love You,"" which topped the Billboard Hot 100 for the second-longest reign in the chart's history. Houston's decorated music career included smash hits such as ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody,"" six Grammys and a slew of Billboard and American Music Awards. She also appeared in movies such as ""Bodyguard"" and ""The Preacher's Wife."" ""She was fresh, her music just drove everybody to want to dance,"" Jones said. ""We all knew she was gonna be somebody -- I can't believe she's gone."" While she ruled as the queen of pop in the 1990s, a rocky personal life tainted her skyrocketing success. Her marriage to Bobby Brown and their tumultuous years were marred by allegations of drug abuse and domestic violence. The pair starred in a reality show, ""Being Bobby Brown,"" an unflattering look at their challenges as a couple. ""Despite her personal setbacks, I never stopped believing in Whitney,"" Jones said. ""It hurt me, and I'm sure it hurt a lot of fans. ... But she was trying to turn her life around. People always remember the bad things, but I am going to remember her for the good things."" Like Jones, her fans say they will focus on her legacy as a singer and the happy memories she brought to their childhoods. ""I can still remember riding with my sister as a teenager and first hearing, 'I Will Always Love You' on the radio. It was the most beautiful song that I had ever heard. It was breathtaking,"" said Traci Nichols of Bowie, Maryland. ""Whenever I had a bad moment, I would play Whitney's CDs and sing along with them, and then, I would immediately feel better. I still do this because her music continues to uplift me."" She had a mesmerizing voice and a perfect poise, Nichols said, a trait that made fans feel connected to her. ""When I was a kid, she was the one I wished I could be -- supremely talented, gorgeous, amazing effortless performances, and she looked like she was having so much fun,"" said Marina Nelson, a San Francisco resident. It's a shame she didn't have a happier life while her music provided the soundtrack for so many fun times when I was growing up."" Nichols plans to do her part to ensure that despite Houston's untimely death, her legacy will live on. Come Monday, she will discuss the legendary singer's appeal with her 11th-grade students.","NEW: Houston was a ""hero for Gen X black girls,"" one fan says .

"(CNN) -- When Apple pulls the veil off of its newest store on Friday, New Yorkers will get their first glimpse at the classical architecture-meets-computers retail space inside Grand Central Terminal. Behind a temporary black facade, which has teased commuters for weeks with ""arriving soon"" messages, Apple has been negotiating aggressively and stealthily with contractors and government agencies to quickly secure a favorable deal. The Grand Central outlet is just one of several high-profile stores the company has been readying with characteristic covertness. Interviews with nearly two dozen people involved in the development of upcoming and recently opened U.S. Apple Stores, including the one in Grand Central, provide a look at Apple's unusually furtive way of doing business. These people say Apple sometimes employs uncommon legal tactics, refuses to name itself in public documents and hearings, and has sworn city government officials to secrecy. Apple's shrewd negotiating tactics are well known in other parts of its business. Nondisclosure agreements are strictly enforced with employees, contractors and partners, and punishment for disloyalty is swift and unforgiving. For example, employees who leak internal memos may be fired as soon as they are discovered. When prototype iPhones were lost in bars in two consecutive years, police officers searched the homes of people suspected of possessing them. But retail chains, especially those that sell electronics, aren't typically associated with controversy. And retail industry executives say Apple's demands for absolute secrecy in its store-development process are peculiar and unjustified. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment for this story. 'Apple is not typical' As buzz grew about work on a Grand Central Apple Store, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which controls the station, spurned many interview requests -- even months after the store was unveiled at a public meeting in July. A New York Times editorial published in August lamented that procuring any details about the project ""was like trying to uncover a state secret."" When reached by phone in October, MTA spokeswoman Marjorie Anders told CNN in response to a question about the soon-to-open Apple Store, ""We're not talking about that."" Why? ""Because Apple doesn't want us to."" Is this typical? ""No, but Apple is not typical,"" Anders said. Further questions, she said, would need to be submitted in a formal Freedom of Information request, a government process that can take months to yield documents. Grand Central is a historic landmark, meaning each project must go through an approval process. Apple asked for its architects to deal directly with New York's State Historic Preservation Office -- a role that's supposed to be handled by the MTA -- so the process was completed promptly, said Beth Cumming, a director for New York's State Historic Preservation Office. Similar maneuvers are being used at other stores. Officials in Berkeley, California, referred questions about a new Apple Store to the city's formal public-records division. They offered two brief reports, one of which Apple did not list its name on. ""We generally don't talk about our customers,"" said Berkeley spokeswoman Mary Kay Clunies-Ross in a phone interview in September. ""We're obviously glad that Apple is here and hope they will stay for a long time."" At a shopping mall in the Seattle suburb of Bellevue, Washington, where Apple already has a store, the computer company is opening a new one on the floor above, where clothing and jewelry stores used to be, according to public documents. The current Apple Store is near a Microsoft Store, which opened last year and has more floor space. Continuing the high-stakes game of one-upmanship, the new Apple Store is even larger, and from the balcony in front, customers can look down on Microsoft's shop. There have been whispers about this brewing battle just miles from Microsoft's headquarters, but people involved in the project are not authorized to speak publicly about it. Jennifer Leavitt, an executive for Kemper Development Company, the Bellevue Collection mall developer, declined to comment. The mysterious black barricade around the store's large perimeter says only that a new store is coming in the spring of next year. Apple leverages success in retail . Apple Stores were conceived as a way for Apple to promote its entire smorgasbord of products and to control their presentation. Typically sleek and minimalistic with uncluttered display counters and no cash registers, each store is a representation of the Apple brand. First opened in 2001, the stores have risen as a financial anomaly in the struggling physical-retail industry. In just a decade, Apple has opened 357 stores worldwide. In the U.S., its shops generate by far the highest sales per square foot -- a coveted statistic in retail -- with $5,626 on average, according to industry research firm RetailSails. In a recent financial disclosure, Apple said it plans to spend about $900 million for retail facilities next year. ""Apple has enormous momentum, and nowhere is that more evident than in our retail stores,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said during the first few minutes of an October news conference to unveil the iPhone 4S. ""We will continue to invest in more and more stores, and raise the bar in retail."" In that speech, Cook emphasized Apple's growth in China. The Shanghai store that opened last year is a breathtaking glass cylinder. While in its planning phases, the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs personally convinced the developer of the surrounding plaza to revise its own construction plans to make the Apple Store the centerpiece, the New York Times reported. For that October article, architect Peter Bohlin spoke in depth with the Times about his work designing Apple Stores. He mentioned that he is working on several stores that will look like the one on New York's Upper West Side, which has a tall glass entrance that stretches up to an all-glass ceiling. But when CNN reached out to Bohlin for comment shortly after the Times report, a spokeswoman for his firm, Bohlin Cywinski Jackson, said, ""Apple has requested that we refrain from granting any additional interviews."" In many cases, Apple's secrecy and strong-arm negotiating has paid off. The increasingly mighty company has managed to secure leases without standard revenue-sharing provisions and has flown through some lengthy public-approval systems. But that may have backfired last week, when the Grand Central Apple Store found its way into the spotlight for reasons other than its attractive layout. Thomas DiNapoli, the state's comptroller, announced that his office would expedite an audit of the MTA's lease with Apple. Audits are common and can take at least two months, but DiNapoli moved up the review in response to a New York Post report about Apple being the only retailer in Grand Central that won't be paying a percentage of sales to the cash-strapped MTA, a comptroller official said. MTA spokesman Aaron Donovan cited Apple's corporate policy, which says it will not cut revenue-sharing agreements for stores. What MTA got out of the deal is Apple's willingness to pay $5 million to buy out a struggling restaurant's lease for that space, and the company's agreement not to significantly modify the station's historic architecture, he said. The new Apple Store, which employs 315 people, will inevitably drive new shoppers to neighboring retailers and to the MTA, which takes a percentage from everyone else's sales, Donovan said. Apple's negotiators, along with most retail executives, are well aware of that fact. No doubt it was a powerful bargaining token.","Details behind Apple's launching of its retail stores reveal a furtive way of doing business .

"(CNN) -- One of a small number of women who have filled a void by becoming police chiefs in violence-torn Mexico was gunned down Monday, authorities said. Hermila Garcia, 38, became the top cop in the town of Meoqui just two months ago. Gunmen attacked her as she drove to work by herself, authorities said. Garcia was one of a handful of women who have taken leadership roles in police departments in cities and towns where men have stayed away because of fear. One of the most high-profile women to take such an assignment is 20-year-old Marisol Valles Garcia, a student who became police chief of Praxedis G. Guerrero, also in the state of Chihuahua. Hermila Garcia was a lawyer by profession and was single with no children. Violence in Chihuahua is due to struggles between rival drug cartels over lucrative smuggling routes, as well as police operations against the cartels. Journalist Edgar Roman contributed to this report for CNN.","Hermila Garcia had been police chief for two months .

"(CNN) -- This week's special unveiling the top Grammy nominations was a 60-minute encapsulation of the year in music: There was Lady Gaga, of course, a Nicki Minaj sighting, a glimpse of Katy Perry and another of Bruno Mars. But the five-letter name on everyone's lips was Adele, the British singer who picked up six nominations and managed to steal the show without even being there. Screaming commenced when her name was mentioned, Entertainment Weekly reports, and the love was so widespread, her competition joined in. ""She's the coolest, most down-to-earth woman, and of course she has a voice like an angel and her album is incredible,"" Bruno Mars, who's also up for six Grammys and is vying for album of the year with the singer, told CNN. Thinking about that, he joked, ""Damn it, why am I up against Adele?!"" Country singer Jason Aldean expressed his sympathies for ""anybody who has to go up against Adele."" He admitted, ""I was actually hoping that if we did get a nomination, it wouldn't be any category with her in it."" (His hopes came true: Aldean is up for best country solo performance, best country duo/group performance and best country album honors.) The 23-year-old Adele has had a banner year since releasing her second album, ""21,"" in February, and her singles ""Rolling In the Deep"" and ""Someone Like You"" have been impossible to escape. (She's had to cancel her remaining 2011 appearances to have throat-related surgery but is expected to make a full recovery.) But does her success make her unbeatable? If not, then pretty close to it, industry observers say. Spin magazine's editor-in-chief, Steve Kandell, said he is fairly convinced. The Grammys can surprise you, he said, but Adele is a unique artist. Whereas some of her competitors may incite arguments about talent, ""with Adele, you just have a singer, in the very classic sense,"" Kandell said. ""She may not be your favorite, but you can't deny that she's good at what she does."" Frankly, he's expecting the young star ""to win everything that isn't nailed down. ... Every now and then there's a juggernaut that's the perfect mix of huge commercial success (the album recently went quadruple platinum) and critical acceptance."" That's not to diminish the talents and achievements of the other players who are also in the running, said Bill Werde, Billboard's editorial director, but rather to view ""21"" as a different beast. ""Kanye (West) put out a really good album; Kanye and Jay-Z put out a really good album; Bruno Mars has emerged as a really powerful songwriter; and Katy Perry this year set Billboard chart records. It's been a phenomenal year for music,"" Werde said. And yet, ""When you talk about Adele's year, it's hard to make the case, from a recorded music perspective, that anyone else is even in the same arena,"" he continued. ""What the Grammy voters tend to love are albums that are both critically successful and commercially successful, and she is an arrow in the heart of that bull's-eye this year. ... It's like Adele and everyone else when it comes to sales, and at the same time, she did it with an album that's incredible."" To top it off, added MTV Hive's managing editor, Jessica Robertson, she's got the back story: ""This album ('21') was born from heartache; she was lovelorn. She's an unlikely pop star in the first place, and then she goes on with this amazing voice to triumph,"" Robertson said. Basically, she's ""served on a Grammy platter."" Of course, there are no guarantees. Robertson said she sees the Foo Fighters bringing some heat for the industry darling in the album of the year category, and Werde noted that Grammy predictions are hit-or-miss. ""To be honest, I'm expecting it to be a big night for Adele,"" Werde said. ""(But) it's in the voters' hands, and if I've learned one thing about predicting Grammy votes over the last 10 years, it's that no one is particularly good at it."" Interestingly enough, the artist consistently mentioned as the one who could have stepped on Adele's toes for album of the year is none other than Kanye West, who wasn't even nominated in that category. The 34-year-old rapper received seven nominations, including a song of the year nod for ""All of the Lights,"" a category in which he'll face Adele's ""Rolling In the Deep."" But it was the album of the year miss for West's ""My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy"" that left many incredulous. ""Kanye certainly deserved an album of the year nomination, and I was pretty surprised that he didn't,"" Robertson said. ""I think if anyone could beat Adele in that category, it would be Kanye, or at least rival her. But he didn't really have the momentum with this album as with previous albums, and certainly not in comparison to Adele's '21.' "" (Robertson also has a theory that West may have split the vote by also putting out another critically recognized album with Jay-Z, ""Watch the Throne."") If West had been nominated, said Spin's Kandell, the race for the album of the year honor would've been a tight one. As it stands though, he said, ""If I'm another nominee, I'm happy to be there.""","Industry observers says British singer Adele may be the one to beat at the Grammys .

"Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland (CNN) -- Senior Airman Aaron Becker repairs medical equipment at a clinic for wounded soldiers at Andrews Air Force Base. Co-workers say he is always giving to others, but they also say Becker's a friend in need. A colleague recently submitted his name to a nonprofit military support group to help his family get around. The nomination paid off Monday as Becker and his wife, Mercy, were handed the keys to a late-model SUV, just in time to get ready for their baby, a girl expected in June. The donation comes from the group Operation Homefront, which generates and allocates financial support and other assistance for military families. The couple lives in military housing near the base in the Maryland suburbs outside of Washington, where getting around without a car isn't all that easy. ""There are things you have to do that aren't on the base,"" Becker said, ""so it's needed. Even getting my wife to her appointments at the hospital and everything else, it's something that, at seven months pregnant, she doesn't really want to walk all the way to the hospital."" Jim Knotts, president of Operation Homefront, said the vehicle came from a government contractor fleet service, which donated it with plenty of mileage remaining to do someone else some good. Becker and his wife rose to the top of the beneficiary list after officials pointed to his efforts maintaining the medical equipment used to treat wounded warriors coming home from battlefields in Afghanistan and Iraq. Knotts said, ""In this case, this is a great example of an airman who is just doing a superb job for his country. He and his wife just starting out, they're gonna have their first baby, they don't have a vehicle, they live just off the base, so they need the vehicle to take care of the baby.""","Pair lives outside of Washington, where getting around without a car isn't easy .

"(CNN) -- Top-level female football in the U.S. was dealt a severe blow on Monday when it was announced the 2012 Women's Professional Soccer (WPS) season had been suspended. The league only began in 2009, but an expensive legal dispute with a former franchise owner has driven the board of governors to halt the five-team competition. The announcement came just 24 hours after the U.S. national women's team had beaten Canada 4-0 to win the North and Central American qualifying tournament for the 2012 Olympics Games in London. ""We are proud of what the league has accomplished in the first three seasons,"" Thomas Hofstetter, owner of the New Jersey-based Sky Blues FC, who won the 2009 WPS playoffs, said in a statement. ""But we do recognize the necessity to resolve our existing legal and operational issues so that we can continue to support and grow WPS the right way. ""This was a very difficult decision, but one we as owners feel is the best business decision for the league at this time."" The legal dispute which has forced the league to take this step is with Dan Borislow, the owner of the Florida-based magicJack franchise. Borislow brought the Washington Freedom team in 2011 before relocating it to Boca Raton and renaming the franchise after his communications company. He repeatedly clashed with WPS over a number of issues, including the size of the magicJack's stadium and reportedly failing to pay player wages. WPS took the decision on October 27 2011 to ""terminate"" the franchise, which had U.S. national team stars such as goalkeeper Hope Solo and striker Abby Wambach on its roster.

"New Haven, Connecticut (CNN) -- A judge in New Haven sentenced a 31-year-old man to death Friday for his role in a deadly home invasion that killed a woman and her two daughters in 2007. Jurors convicted Joshua Komisarjevsky in October on six capital felony charges. The 12-member jury had recommended death by lethal injection on each of the counts. ""The task of sentencing another human being to death is the most sober and somber experience a judge can have,"" said Superior Court Judge Jon Blue. Komisarjevsky responded Friday, saying that he ""came into this trial angry and defiant."" It's a ""surreal experience to be condemned to die,"" he said. ""Our apathetic pursuits trampled the innocent."" He said, ""I did not rape. I did not pour that gas or light that fire."" ""I will never find peace again and my soul is torn,"" Komisarjevsky added. The family of his victims left the courtroom before Komisarjevsky spoke. Richard Hawke, in a victim's statement prior to the sentencing, said the killings of his daughter and granddaughters had left him ""half-past dead."" ""They offered to give you everything you asked for, you didn't have to take their lives,"" he told Komisarjevsky. ""You will from now on be known as a prison number in the book of death. You are now in God's hands."" The man convicted of being Komisarjevsky's accomplice, Steven Hayes, was sentenced to death in 2010. Juries convicted the pair on charges that they beat and tied up Dr. William Petit Jr., raped and strangled his wife, molested one of their daughters and set the house on fire before trying to flee. Petit is the sole survivor of the attack that killed his wife and two daughters. ""I lost my family and my home,"" said Petit. ""My wife, my friend, my partner. I miss our late night chats and our partnership in raising the girls."" Before assaulting and killing Jennifer Hawke-Petit, Hayes forced her to go to a bank and withdraw $15,000 from an account after finding evidence that the account held between $20,000 and $30,000, authorities said. The two daughters, who were both tied to their beds, died of smoke inhalation, while William Petit managed to escape from the basement, where he had been held. Hayes had been charged with third-degree burglary in 2003 and sentenced to five years in prison. He was released three years later to a halfway house, where he met Komisarjevsky. Komisarjevsky's attorneys had asked for leniency, arguing that he had no prior history of violence, was abused as a child and had been committed to a mental hospital for depression.","A judge sentences Joshua Komisarjevsky to death .

"(CNN) -- Beef from Brazil is on Iranian dinner tables. An Iranian-built hospital treats patients near Bolivia's capital. Iranian-funded factories dot the Venezuelan countryside. Iran has forged hundreds of agreements with Latin American nations and pledged billions of dollars to fund them. More deals could be in store this week as Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad embarks on a trip that starts in Venezuela on Sunday and includes stops in Nicaragua, Cuba and Ecuador. Well before the Iranian leader's arrival in Caracas, his plans for a Latin America tour grabbed global attention as tensions grow between many Western powers and Iran over the nation's nuclear program. ""As the regime feels increasing pressure, it is desperate for friends and flailing around in interesting places to find new friends,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters Friday. But analysts say Ahmadinejad's visit is the latest step in a longstanding, calculated effort to shore up support in the region. As Iran strives to improve its image, get around stiffening sanctions, dampen America's global influence and secure a stronger foothold in the United States' backyard, relationships with Latin American countries have become increasingly important. Iran's state-run Press TV described cooperation with Latin American nations as one of the ""top priorities of the Islamic Republic's foreign policy"" in a recent article about this week's trip. ""Iran has an extremely active diplomatic move afoot,"" said Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs in Washington. 'Cultural ties' Last month, a film portraying the life of Mary and the birth of Jesus from an Islamic point of view beamed out over international airwaves -- in Spanish. The movie was the first program aired on HispanTV, according to a report in the Tehran Times. And the target audience was thousands of miles away from the government-sponsored broadcasting hub in Iran's capital. At a ceremony marking the station's official launch last month, HispanTV's managers said the new Spanish network aims to paint a true picture of Iran and link the Islamic republic with Latin America. Other Spanish-language channels are ""not independent and only serve the interest of the United States and certain allies,"" said Mohammed Sarafraz, director of Iranian broadcasting's world service, according to Press TV. ""It's all about cultural ties between Iran and the Spanish-speaking community,"" network manager Ali Ejaredar told a Press TV reporter. Online previews of upcoming programming include videos showing scenic stretches of the Iranian countryside, bustling marketplaces and Persian calligraphy. An analyst on one program criticizes Western imperialism, saying ""five countries cannot decide the destiny of the world."" A guest on another show slams U.S. immigration laws. Spanish-language headlines on the network's website last week described Israeli spies, foreign intervention in Syria, a report that Japan plans to ""disobey"" U.S. sanctions against Iran and an allegation that airport security screening machines in the United States cause death. Stephen Johnson, who directs the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, compared Iran's efforts to use the media to improve its image abroad to the U.S.-government-funded Voice of America radio network. ""They're taking a page out of our playbook,"" he said. Despite Iran's overtures, there are still rifts to overcome, Johnson said. Some high-profile missteps have accompanied Iran's increasing forays into Latin America, he said. A requirement that female employees wear the hijab at an Iran-funded hospital in El Alto, Bolivia, drew criticism from local officials. Uruguay's foreign minister condemned statements by an Iranian ambassador who told reporters in the South American country that figures saying that millions died in the Holocaust were false. Last year, Iran received the lowest ranking out of nine countries in the Latinobarometro public opinion survey, based on interviews of more than 20,000 residents in 18 Latin American countries (not including Cuba). Only 25% of those surveyed said they viewed Iran as ""good"" or ""very good,"" while 72% said they viewed the United States positively. ""I think with Iran, it's a question of trust as to what are they up to, and what are their nuclear objectives,"" Johnson said. Ahmadinejad's 'direct, personal role' Experts say Iran has been building relations in Latin America for decades. Cuba was one of the first countries to recognize Iran's government after the 1979 revolution. Fidel Castro made his first official visit to Iran in 2001. But efforts to forge new business deals and bolster diplomatic efforts have intensified since Ahmadinejad's tenure as president began in 2005. ""He's presided over a really significant expansion of Iranian ties across Latin America. ... Ahmadinejad himself has played a very direct, personal role in that process,"" said Steven Heydemann, who researched Iran's alliances as part of his work as senior adviser for Middle East initiatives at the United States Institute of Peace. And it's no coincidence that Venezuela will be Ahmadinejad's first stop on his trip to the region -- his sixth as president. Despite their cultural differences, the two nations have found significant common ground: both are among the world's top crude oil exporters, and their leaders have become strong allies united by a fierce opposition to what they view as U.S. imperialism. Even as he announced last week that Ahmadinejad's visit would go ahead as scheduled, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez slammed the United States, saying that ""tensions in the Persian Gulf have been growing in recent hours because of Yankee pressures,"" state-run VTV reported. British warship to deploy to Persian Gulf . Venezuela and Iran already have signed more than 270 accords, including trade deals, construction projects, car and tractor factories, energy initiatives and banking programs. Flights began traveling between Caracas and Tehran as the relationship blossomed. In addition to the numerous deals with Iran under his government, the Venezuelan president has helped the Islamic republic forge relationships with other members of the Bolivarian Alliance of the Americas, an eight-nation regional bloc Chavez founded. Ahmadinejad's visit comes as those countries continue efforts to craft regional trade and political deals without Washington's influence. ""The countries of Latin America are saying to the world that they have sovereignty and independence. They are not subordinate to the dictates of the international polices of the United States,"" said Nicmer Evans, a political science professor at the Central University of Venezuela in Caracas. And now, with the specter of increased U.S. and European sanctions looming, Iran has an even deeper need to reach out, he said. ""The visit by Ahmadinejad to Venezuela and the rest of the countries reinforces on Iran's part that they are not isolated. They are demonstrating it publicly,"" Evans said. On a practical level, analysts say Iran is likely looking for financial options. ""It's clear that Iran is being really hammered by the sanctions, and I think that what they're really looking for in Latin America is to develop ways to blunt the effects of the sanctions, particularly with the establishment of financial institutions that will allow them to move their money,"" said Doug Farah, a senior fellow at the International Assessment and Strategy Center. Washington's worries . But when it comes to Iran, the U.S. State Department says there is no room for new deals. ""We are making absolutely clear to countries around the world that now is not the time to be deepening ties -- not security ties, not economic ties -- with Iran,"" Nuland, the department's spokeswoman, told reporters Friday. Officials in the United States and other Western nations have ratcheted up sanctions against Iran several times since a November report by the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency said the Iranian government was developing the technology needed to build a nuclear weapon. Last month, U.S. President Barack Obama announced sanctions against Iran's central bank. Iran: Nuclear reactor is weeks from operating at full capacity . Several Venezuelan institutions have also faced U.S. sanctions for dealings with Iran. Venezuela's state oil company, PdVSA, faced U.S. sanctions last year over fuel shipments to Iran. And the U.S. Department of the Treasury sanctioned an Iranian-owned bank in Caracas in 2008. Some U.S. government officials and Washington analysts allege that Iran could be using new business relationships and energy deals with Latin American countries as a cover for more illicit projects, such as training Hezbollah militants and developing nuclear weapons. ""Iran and its Bolivarian allies (Venezuela, Bolivia, Nicaragua and Ecuador) in Latin America are systematically engaged in a pattern of financial behavior, recruitment exercises and business activities that are not economically rational and could be used for the movement and/or production of (weapons of mass destruction) and the furthering of Iran's stated aim of avoiding international sanctions on its nuclear program,"" Farah wrote in a May 2011 report for the U.S. Defense Department. Latin American leaders have repeatedly stressed that any partnerships with Iran have peaceful purposes. Venezuelan officials made light of U.S. worries in a government statement describing one new Venezuela-Iran partnership in 2008: ""atomic"" bicycles made at a new national factory. ""The bicycles are known as 'atomic,' in an ironic sense, as a response to the United States' constant attacks of Venezuela for its exchanges with Iran and the supposed transfer of uranium from our country to the Islamic nation,"" Venezuela's information ministry said in a statement accompanied by photos of Chavez riding one of the bikes outside the factory. Smoke and mirrors? The realities of the relationships between Iran and its Latin American allies are difficult to decipher, analysts say, because despite the large number of agreements trumpeted, information about the projects is often hard to come by. ""Half of them evaporate. They simply are forgotten. They don't become operational,"" said Birns of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs. Heydemann, of the United States Institute of Peace, said some of the deals may be ""smoke and mirrors."" ""There's often a lot less happening than the volume of activity would lead you to believe. But it is the case that we have seen these substantial increases in trade relations. ... That's not an illusion,"" he said. With so many unanswered questions, U.S. officials will be keeping a close eye on this week's trip, said Johnson, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""It's not an existential threat to the United States,"" he said, ""but Iran's activities (in Latin America) are something that they're watching because of what they could develop into, not because of what they necessarily are today. There's a lot we don't know about them."" Journalist Osmary Hernandez in Caracas and CNN's Gustavo Gonzalez and Arthur Brice in Atlanta contributed to this report.","President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad begins a four-nation Latin America tour .

"Seoul (CNN) -- It took two teenage suicide cases due to school bullying last year in South Korea for people to notice something was very wrong. The students lived in different cities and went to different schools, but both jumped to their deaths after saying they could not take the pain of being bullied any longer. Over the last few weeks, the country's media has been filled with reports about tragic cases of school bullying. This week, two more students from the same class reportedly took their own lives -- one was the victim of bullying, the other a powerless friend who had stood by and watched the abuse. Experts say the cases highlight how desperately many South Korean teenagers need a means to escape the bullying as well as a way to cope. Park Han-wool, a 17-year-old high-school student, said he has been bullied for the past six years. He has been isolated from other classmates, beaten during school trips and locked up in the classroom. ""I wanted to tell people about it. I did tell my parents, but they didn't take it seriously thinking it was an issue between friends,"" he said. The bullying became so bad that Park tried to jump from his school building in front of his teachers, but he was stopped by the police. He is now involved in creating a music video with other teenagers to raise awareness of school bullying, an issue he says that was not taken seriously until recently. The tools of bullying vary from forcing victims to run errands and steal, to sexual assault, confinement and gang beatings. With reports of other incidents of teenage violence n schools, including the assault of teachers and rape of younger students, many South Koreans are asking, ""what is wrong with our kids?"" The answer, according to some analysts, lies within the hyper-competitive nature of South Korean society. As the country continues to enjoy success economically, Korean students are being pushed into an environment of competition to succeed. ""At school, students don't see their peers as friends but as competition and believe that they need to beat others,"" said Dr. Bae Joo-mi, a specialist at the Korea Youth Counseling Institute. In a classroom environment in which students are forced to prove themselves, those who fall behind in grades turn to other means to show they are more powerful, taking on the role of the aggressor, Bae explained. The family support system also fails many adolescents. ""The parents heavily invest in raising their children to be successful and skillful in various fields, but when it comes to raising them to be moral and have healthy personalities I think there has been a lack of interest,"" Bae said. Schools and teachers have been criticized for turning the other way in bullying cases and trying to cover it up. Local governments have gone into a frenzy of drafting up new measures to hold bullies accountable and prevent school violence. Experts such as Bae believe it may take more than simply increasing monitoring of school violence. What students need is a healthier environment to learn more social skills and know how to deal with their problems, they say. A survey conducted in 2010 by the Foundation for Preventing Youth Violence, a counseling center established more than 15 years ago, indicated that more than 20% of those surveyed said they had been bullied. Of those victims, more than 30% said they felt suicidal due to bullying. The same group said last year that the number of counseling cases of students seeking help from suicidal feelings doubled from the previous year. The concern is that students have not been able to learn how to find solutions to their problems in a rigid educational environment and are now turning to suicide as their last resort. Counseling groups urge the government and schools to step up and punish those accountable, while keeping the victims safe from harm.","South Korea's media has been filled with reports about tragic cases of school bullying .

"(CNN) -- Jakadrien Turner's lies last year to authorities in Texas -- including adopting an alter ego and claiming she was from Colombia -- set off a harrowing journey that, according to posts on a Facebook page featuring photographs of her, she seemed to later regret. By Friday, the troubled teenager was finally back in the United States, after being arrested and then deported to a country that she'd never been in before. It was a months-long escapade that has her family asking questions about how she got to the South American nation and what happened to her while there. Jakadrien's journey began April 2, 2011, in a Houston, Texas, shopping mall where the 15-year-old was arrested for shoplifting a white shirt, black vest and jeans. It was a petty crime that turned out to be the first step in her changing her identity. Houston police, according to documents obtained by CNN, show that Turner told authorities that her name was 21-year-old Tika Lanay Cortez and that she was a citizen of Colombia. She listed her address as a home just north of downtown Houston. A judge assigned Houston attorney William McLellan to represent the woman then known as Tika Cortez on the misdemeanor theft charge. The case was resolved in one day, after she pleaded guilty and was sentenced to time served. She was then handed over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Deported Texas teen arrives back in U.S. McLellan said he never saw any signs that his client was a teenage runaway from Dallas, and not from Colombia as she indicated. ""She didn't make any attempts and cry out that I'm not an illegal immigrant or anything like that,"" McLellan told CNN. ""You would remember someone saying that's not me."" The lawyer said, eight months later, he now believes ""she knew what she was doing"" -- even if he is hard-pressed to explain why. Whatever her thinking, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents say Jakadrien Turner continued to play the role of ""Tika Cortez"" during the next two months. Federal immigration officials say they're ""still investigating this matter in order to expeditiously determine the facts of this case."" The attorney representing the Turner family said that the U.S. government is to blame, not the girl, for her deportation. ""I don't buy that she had the wherewithal to be able to bamboozle the government,"" Ray Jackson says. ""You know, kids are scared when they get around authorities. ... To think that you could bamboozle them to create a new identity, it just doesn't make sense."" A U.S. immigration official -- who was not able to speak for attribution, because the investigation is ongoing -- said that that the girl then known as Tika Cortez waived her right to an immigration attorney and did not fight deportation proceedings. According to U.S. immigration officials, they'd never come across anyone by the name Tika Cortez. Her fingerprints did not match anyone in law enforcement databases, nor was there a match for the name Jakadrien Turner. And the background check ""revealed no information to invalidate her claims,"" the officials said. Colombian government officials then interviewed Jakadrien and issued her the needed travel documents and ""full Colombian citizenship,"" according to the U.S. immigration officials. That meant that, six months after running away from her Dallas home, the 15-year-old girl was on her way to Colombia -- for the first time in her life. She arrived in Bogota on May 23, according to the Colombian government. What exactly happened, once she arrived in the South American nation, is unclear. Dana Ames has been advising the Turner family in the search for Jakadrien for almost a year in her capacity as the director of the United Response Search and Rescue Team, a non-profit agency that helps families find missing loved ones. She and members of Jakadrien's family say that various internet postings they discovered show that two Colombian men befriended the runaway teenager and they spent a lot of time together during her time in Houston. ""So you think it's a coincidence she came up with a Colombian name and said she was from Colombia?"" said Ames. ""Otherwise she is absolutely the smartest, most creative 15-year-old child I know of. I can't wrap my brain around the idea that she did this all on her own."" After arriving in Colombia, a Facebook page and Twitter feed arose tied to someone using her adopted moniker, Tika Cortez. If the postings were indeed written by the runaway teen, they offer a glimpse into the tormented troubles of a lost teenager. The writer claims to be from Bridgetown, Barbados, and studied at Texas Southern University, neither of which are true of Jakadrien Turner. The writings also indicate that their author spent some time working in a telephone call center and as a maid in Bogota. But the most dominant theme of the Facebook posts, which went up between June and November of last year, is that the person identified as Tika Cortez is ""BORED AS HELL."" The writer also talks about smoking marijuana and being part of tortured and volatile relationships. A couple of times, the writer references her life back in the United States including: . -- On May 25: ""back home in Colombia got deported. .. really missed everyone in Houston..."" -- On August 12: ""well was in jail, now I'm free man am still feel like I'm loke up in this country..."" -- And on June 30: ""I'm having to many problems in mi life, just found out I can't even go bak to the states in another 5 years..."" Only once does the writer appear to cryptically allude to the journey that landed her in Colombia. That came on a July 28 Facebook post that reads, ""I'm f**king tired I just want a f**king time machine, and rewind all the bull**it I did wrong man OMG.. I'm never going to be happy here."" The tone is far different in a more recent post from October, one month before Colombian authorities took Jakadrien into custody. It includes a series of pictures uploaded under the banner, ""familia, me happy 4 once in the mountains."" For Jakadrien Turner's grandmother, who spent months monitoring these Facebook postings, this was difficult to read. Still, she told CNN that, despite it all, she is grateful that her granddaughter is alive. ""I always feared she would be killed,"" Lorene Turner said. Now, the teenage girl is back home in Texas -- alive in a place she hasn't been in over a year, near her family.","Jakadrien Turner told police that she was from Colombia after being arrested .

"London (CNN) -- The editors of Rupert Murdoch's News of the World tabloid knew that their reporters were hacking phones in search of stories, former News of the World journalist Paul McMullan testified Tuesday. He named Andy Coulson, who went on to become an adviser to British Prime Minister David Cameron, and Rebekah Brooks, a Murdoch protege, as editors who were aware of the practice. Coulson resigned as editor of the tabloid in 2007 when one of his reporters went to prison for hacking the voice mails of Prince William's staff, and he later became Cameron's communications director. Coulson has always denied knowing about phone hacking, saying he quit the paper because he was ultimately responsible for the actions of his staff. McMullan was testifying before the Leveson Inquiry, a probe Cameron established in the face of public anger at the news that the News of the World hacked the phone of 13-year-old murder victim Milly Dowler. The Leveson Inquiry has been hearing from high-profile figures for more than a week. McMullan said phone hacking was widespread at the tabloid and described being caught out himself while trying to hack David Beckham's phone. The soccer star shocked him by answering the phone before McMullan could dial the code to access his voice mail, forcing the journalist to hang up quickly, he said. He argued that the public was complicit in the country's tabloid culture, saying newspapers publish stories about stars because ""there is a taste for it, there is a market for it."" Celebrities also use the tabloid press to increase their exposure, he said, describing how model Katie Price, better known as Jordan, gave him the finger through a window. He snapped a picture of her, thinking, ""Thanks, love,"" and sold it for 2,000 pounds ($3,100). ""She knew exactly what she was doing,"" he said. He also defended the tabloids' methods as part of a free society, saying he would not want to live in a country where only the secret services were able to hack phones. His defense of the tabloids came a day after singer Charlotte Church blasted the News of the World tabloid for its decision to publish a lurid story about her father having an affair while her mother was getting treatment for mental illness. ""They knew how vulnerable she was and still printed a story like that, which is just horrific,"" she said. The former child star also spoke of her anger at finding out her phone may have been hacked by a private investigator working for the Rupert Murdoch tabloid. The investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, had details of her phone and those of her parents, friends and former boyfriends, Church said police had told her. Mulcaire went to prison for hacking royal staff voice mails along with News of the World royal correspondent Clive Goodman. Celebrities who have already testified before the inquiry include ""Harry Potter"" author J.K. Rowling and ""G.I. Joe"" actress Sienna Miller, who both complained of being hounded by paparazzi. Actor Hugh Grant also appeared before the panel, and he implied that police leaked information to the tabloid press. He also accused the Mail on Sunday of hacking. Police investigating phone hacking by journalists say that about 5,800 people, including celebrities, crime victims, politicians and members of the royal family, were targets of the practice by journalists in search of stories. It involves illegally eavesdropping on voice mail by entering a PIN to access messages remotely.","NEW: Paul McMullan says the public and celebrities are complicit in tabloid culture .

"London (CNN) -- A powerful British media group is fighting new accusations that it illegally got information on members of the royal family and top politicians, after a lawmaker accused it of hacking. Police have information that ""strongly suggests"" that a private investigator targeted royals, lawmakers and high-level terrorist informers on behalf of Rupert Murdoch's News International, Labour lawmaker Tom Watson said in Parliament Wednesday. British media said the targets included former Prime Minister Tony Blair and Kate Middleton when she was dating Prince William, the second in line to the throne. They married in April. Buckingham Palace and Prince William's office at Clarence House both declined to comment. But London's Metropolitan Police told CNN Thursday it ""has received a number of allegations regarding breach of privacy.... These allegations are currently being considered."" News International rejected the accusation. ""With regards to Tom Watson's specific allegations, we believe these are wholly inaccurate,"" the company told CNN Thursday, adding that it was cooperating with ongoing police investigations into phone hacking and had not been asked about the work of the private investigator Watson named in Parliament. But it said it was ""well documented"" that the investigator ""worked for a whole variety of newspaper groups."" Murdoch's media group, which owns the Sunday tabloid News of the World, has already apologized to a number of celebrities and offered them compensation after admitting it had their phones hacked. Actress Sienna Miller was among the victims, a British court ruling in June confirmed. A News of the World royal correspondent and a private investigator were sent to prison in 2007 for hacking into the voice mails of members of the royal staff. But Watson named a different investigator Wednesday, undercutting the long-standing News International claim that the practice of phone hacking was not widespread. The Metropolitan Police are conducting an investigation called Operating Weeting into the accusations of hacking by British media. They said Thursday the allegations they have received this year are ""outside the remit of Operation Weeting."" But Prime Minister David Cameron said Thursday that a ""police inquiry does not need terms of reference"" and that police are ""free to investigate the evidence and take that wherever it leads them."" Murdoch's media empire encompasses the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post, Fox News and Harper Collins publishers, as well as the Times and the Sun newspapers in London. CNN's Richard Allen Greene, Carol Jordan and Bharati Naik contributed to this report.","A British lawmaker accuses News International of more hacking of royals and politicians .

"(CNN) -- Russian steel, Ukrainian maize, tea from India, palm oil from Malaysia -- myriad products are shipped through the Gulf emirates. Iran wants and needs them all. But in the last few months, the growing web of U.S. and European sanctions has begun to paralyze its ability to import and export key products. Multiple banking, shipping and trade sources tell CNN that Iran is struggling to import staples and export crude oil as its access to the global financial system is curbed. As a result, inflation is rising and shortages of basic products are growing. Take Iran's huge appetite for steel. Normally, it imports about 300,000 tons of steel products a month from Russia alone, mainly for infrastructure and construction. ""Now it's zero. It really is that bad,"" said Katya Ourakova, who follows the Russian steel industry for Platts Steel Business Briefing. Ourakova says that Russia, the main exporter of steel to Iran, has been exploring ways to get round the financing problems. In December, she said, ""Russian and Iranian trade envoys were discussing a ruble scheme, but so far nothing has been finalized."" Most trade with Iran relies on letters of credit, and those are now routinely denied by banks anxious not to incur the wrath of the U.S. Treasury. A commercial source in Iran says one South Korean metals company canceled letters of credit following the latest sanctions by Europe and the United States. It is now considering barter: steel for chemicals. Imports of Ukrainian maize are also caught in the financing squeeze. Trade sources say thousands of tons are stuck in limbo between Ukrainian and Iranian ports, unloaded for lack of payment because Iranian importers cannot obtain letters of credit. Iran usually needs to import about 3.5 million tons of maize a year, according to figures from the International Grains Council, but commodity traders report a sharp drop in shipments. There is no shortage of money in Iran. Export revenues have been buoyed by high oil prices, according to the International Monetary Fund. And by Gulf standards, Iran has a diverse economy. The problem is financing, and the fear of being tainted by association with Iran's central bank or other financial entities. The scope of United States sanctions is sweeping. Those signed into law at the end of 2011 ""require the President to block the property and interests in property subject to U.S. jurisdiction of all Iranian financial institutions, including the Central Bank of Iran ('CBI'). It also aims to reduce Iranian oil revenues and discourage transactions with the CBI by providing for sanctions on foreign financial institutions that knowingly conduct or facilitate certain significant financial transactions with the CBI."" Few want to touch Iranian crude . A source familiar with the U.S. sanctions strategy says banks have been made aware of the potential price of doing business with Iran -- even indirectly. In addition to the sanctions, the U.S. Treasury Department has named Iran as a center of money laundering. It's not just banks. International shipping companies are now much more reluctant to call at Iranian ports or unload Iranian oil. A European Union ban on imports of oil from Iran comes into effect in July, but the signing of new contracts was banned on January 23. In the U.S., legislation in Congress would ban from U.S. ports any ship that has called at an Iranian port in the preceding 180 days. One of the world's major operators, Moller-Maersk, has already suspended tanker deals with Iran. Intertanko, an organization representing many of the world's independent tanker owners, told CNN: ""We are advising our members to comply with all sanctions at all times."" The consortium Tankers International, which has 45 of the largest crude carriers in its pool, decided that in view of the EU measures and ""other factors, including the inability of owners to maintain insurance cover while trading in Iran, Tankers International will no longer have any vessels ... trade to Iran."" ""Teekay Tankers strictly complies with all sanctions and is not calling at Iran,"" said Bruce Chan, CEO of Teekay, another major shipper. Picking up Iranian crude ""is like getting leprosy,"" one shipping executive said. This month, at least two cargoes of Iranian crude were sitting at the Sidi Kerir terminal in Egypt, but no one wanted to handle them for fear of falling foul of European sanctions, according to the leading industry publication Platts. The International Energy Agency confirmed to CNN that in its latest Oil Market Report to clients, it has warned that ""confusion over the likely implementation of U.S. and European financial sanctions is causing marine insurers and ship-owners to be doubly cautious over the provision of [insurance] cover and the routes sailed."" Confusion over sanctions . Platts reports that Asian buyers of Iranian crude are struggling to find vessels willing to call at Iranian ports because of the lack of insurance cover, but it quotes industry sources as saying that Indian and Chinese owners ""have no issues"" with loading Iranian crude. Perhaps most damaging to the Iranian economy is the sharp decline in trade across the Gulf from Oman and Dubai. Banks in the Gulf emirates have begun to halt the financing of exports to Iran. About 8,000 Iranian-owned trading firms have a presence in Dubai, and the United Arab Emirates as a whole re-exported about $9 billion in goods to Iran in the first nine months of last year, according to figures from UAE authorities. But without letters of credit, that volume has fallen sharply in recent months. Imports of everything from machinery to rice are affected, even though sanctions don't apply directly to such products. Morteza Masoumzadeh, director of the Iranian Business Council based in Dubai, told CNN last month that traders were going out of business, starved of finance. They've also been hurt by the rapid depreciation of the Iranian rial, now valued at ""17,000 rials when their calculations were based on 10,000 rials to the dollar,"" Masoumzadeh says. Pending U.S. legislation may further turn the screw. A bill that passed the U.S. Senate Banking Committee this month would ban any foreign bank from handling transactions by Iranian oil companies and would seek to block Iranian access to the system that enables international banking transactions. SWIFT action . That system is called SWIFT, or the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. Based in Belgium, it enables nearly 10,000 banks and financial institutions worldwide to do business. The bill would direct the U.S. Treasury to put pressure on the banks that own SWIFT to exclude Iranian entities. The Senate bill has to be reconciled with a similar measure that has passed the House of Representatives. The Iranian economy can withstand sanctions, economic analysts say. Iran had foreign exchange reserves of about $80 billion in 2009, according to the IMF, and does not carry huge debt. In addition, countries like China and India see an opportunity in continuing to trade with Iran. India plans to send a large trade delegation to Tehran later this month, insisting that it need only abide by U.N.-approved sanctions against Iran. In recent years, Iranian banks have successfully moved away from the dollar to finance trade and turned instead to the euro. Now, as sanctions multiply, that source is also drying up. Iranian businesses will need time to develop alternative trading mechanisms, such as barter agreements or settling contracts in currencies such as the South Korean won or Indian rupee. And the effect of sanctions could be enough to push the economy from modest growth (currently 2.5% according to the IMF) into recession, economic forecasters say. One example is the shortage of steel, which is forcing domestic prices higher in Iran and threatening the country's ambitious plans to build its own steel industry. ""Iran wants to produce 45 million tons of crude steel by 2015 -- by building eight or nine plants. But they can't finish construction of these plants, which themselves demand a lot of steel to build,"" said Ourakova, the Russian steel industry specialist. Emily Smith, Leone Lakhani and Anna Lisa Stone contributed to this report.","Iran is struggling to import staples and export crude oil, other key products .

"(CNN) -- For a recovering addict, reveling at a party or having pills in your room can be seen as a sign you are in control, having successfully defeated your demons -- or just as likely, experts say, a sign of weakness that could lead to a dangerous, if not deadly, outcome. On any given day, an estimated 23.5 million Americans need help to overcome chronic substance abuse, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration. By her own admission, Whitney Houston once was one of them -- until her still unexplained death last Saturday in her Beverly Hills, California, hotel room. Funeral for Whitney Houston set for Saturday . She had admitted in the past having done marijuana and cocaine, spoke about her mother staging an intervention for her and made several trips to rehab. Yet more recently, many of her friends contended that Houston's spirits, and her health, seemed good. Authorities have not yet ruled on why the iconic singer died. The Los Angeles County coroner's office has downplayed the suspicion that drugs played a major role. Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter said Monday that ""not many prescription bottles"" were found in the singer's Beverly Hilton hotel room after her death. The amount of medications recovered by investigators was less than usually present in deaths attributed to overdoses, Winter said. Singer Kelly Price told CNN that ""Whitney was partying, she was happy ... maybe a little tipsy because she had champagne"" at an event two nights before she died. Mixing pills and drinking can be a ""bad, bad combo,"" former musician, admitted junkie and now addiction specialist Bob Forrest said. Whether or not substance abuse had anything to do with the songstress's death, her well-chronicled struggles with drugs are a part of her story, just as they were a part of her life. LZ Granderson: Death sad, but no shock . What is addiction, what it can do to people, and what can be done about it? The good news, say experts, is that addicts can get better. To do so, one critical element is having self-awareness -- understanding the roots of one's problems, and often pain, plus knowing what environmental or personal triggers might set off a relapse. Another is control, by being strong enough to resist temptations and to accept one's vulnerabilities. And a third factor is vigilance, given that addiction is a relentless and unforgiving condition, for which any slip-up can be potentially fatal. ""It is incurable, but it's treatable,"" said William Cope Moyers, a vice president of the Minnesota-based Hazelden treatment center. ""(But) recovery is only possible if the addict or alcoholic is part of the solution."" Having himself gone to rehab four times in one five-year stretch, Moyers -- a former journalist who worked at CNN in the early 1990s -- stressed that for a Whitney Houston or other recovering addict, willpower alone does not work. Nor is recovery as simple as deciding, from here on out, to say no to drugs or alcohol. He also disputes the notion that addiction ""is a reflection of a bad upbringing ... or a lack of faith."" Reverend: The Whitney I knew . Yet an addict must believe he has a problem. While it is more straightforward to tell a patient that a tumor is malignant, a doctor is often more hard-pressed to tell someone they have a serious addiction -- even though it can be deadly, like cancer -- said Dr. Morteza Khaleghi, founder of the Creative Care Malibu center. And rarely is that first step the last one, addiction-recovery experts say. Relapses, and repeated visits to rehab centers and treatment programs, are common for addicts before it sinks in how grave their problems are and what they can do about them -- unless the addiction kills them first. Houston herself admitted in a 2009 interview with Oprah Winfrey that she once ""did (her) 30 days"" in one rehab facility, got out, and yet her drug use continued. She said she was finally convinced to get serious about her recovery when her mother, renowned gospel singer Cissy Houston, came to her door with a sheriff and a ""court injunction,"" saying, ""You do it my way or we're not going to do this at all."" Whitney Houston: A mother, a daughter, a friend . Aside from any physical challenges, overcoming addiction is hard work mentally and emotionally. And if you let down your guard, warns interventionist and ""How to Help the One You Love"" author Brad Lamm, it can come back with a vengeance -- as bad, if not worse, than before. That's why specialists say it is so imperative that an addict know what places, situations, smells are more likely to set him or her back. They generally recommend that those who have been hooked before -- on whatever substance -- avoid situations like a raging party or raucous club scene, as well as that they take pains to limit their exposure to prescription drugs or alcohol. ""Relapse is just around the corner, but it's your responsibility as a recovering person to know all your trigger points,"" said Khaleghi. The Creative Care executive director, for one, says that relinquishing some control and admitting your limitations -- including what you can handle and cannot, at least without help -- is critical to success. Singer Kim Burrell said about her good friend that Houston was ""strong"" and ""smart as a whip,"" yet hesitant to let anyone else make decisions for her. ""She was her own woman, she made her own choices, and she was adamant about that,"" said Burrell. It is inevitable, and in many ways essential, that addicts at some point draw up their own boundaries. Experts say it is not necessary or logical for them to carry on feeling like they are trapped in a bubble, adding it is important that they eventually take ownership of their lives and their problems. Still, for those with an addictive history, making those decisions comes with great risk. ""Each person gets to decide what their own baseline is,"" said Lamm. ""And it changes for different people, at different times. But it's really a slippery slope, especially if you start taking any drug (including alcohol) again.""","Before her death, Whitney Houston had a history of substance abuse issues .

"London (CNN) -- Rupert Murdoch launched a new British tabloid Sunday to replace his disgraced News of the World, seven months after the best-selling Sunday paper was shut down over a phone-hacking and bribery scandal. The ""new"" newspaper isn't entirely new -- it's a Sunday edition of Murdoch's Sun tabloid, which had been a six-day-a-week paper until now. Its leading editorial on launch day took a defensive tone in discussing the closure of the News of the World. ""The Sun has been a tremendous force for good,"" its editors insisted. ""It is worth reminding our readers, and detractors, of that as we publish our historic first Sunday edition."" The parent company of both tabloids, News International, ""closed our sister paper the News of the World over the phone hacking scandal. Since then some of our own journalists have been arrested, though not charged, over allegations of payments to public officials for stories,"" the editors said. ""We believe those individuals are innocent until proven guilty,"" they said. The first edition of the Sunday tabloid sets a tone like that of its weekday sister, leading with the story of a television presenter's difficult childbirth and putting a scantily-clad picture of singer Kelly Rowland on page three -- a slot occupied by topless models during the week. Nelson Mandela's hospitalization at the age of 93 makes page 8, under the headline ""Nelson Tum Op"" and above a picture of actress Kate Winslet in a low-cut dress accepting an acting prize. Under Murdoch, News of the World specialized in undercover investigations and salacious stories that earned it the nickname ""News of the Screws."" But revelations last year that it had paid for the hacking of voice mail messages to murder and terrorism victims and fallen troops, as well as celebrities and politicians, forced the paper to close. Police are running three separate investigations -- into phone hacking, e-mail hacking, and police bribery -- and two parliamentary committees and an independent inquiry are also probing British press practices. Murdoch testified before one of the panels of lawmakers last year, calling it the ""most humble day of his life."" A former spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron, ex-News of the World editor Andy Coulson, is among those arrested. No one has been charged. The Sunday Sun launched with a print run of 3 million, far more than any daily newspaper sells in Britain, but well below the 4.75 million sales for the last issue of News of the World, according to its publisher. News of the World was 168 years old and among the best-selling newspapers in the world when it closed.","The Sun on Sunday launches after News of the World closed in disgrace .

"(CNN) -- Two pool employees and their supervisor were forced to resign on Wednesday after a woman's body went undetected in a public Massachusetts pool for four days in June until her body floated to the top. The Vietnam Veteran's Swimming Pool manager and assistant manager -- as well as the Southeast Regional Director of the state Department of Conservation and Recreation, have resigned -- according to a statement released by Edward Lambert, the agency's commissioner. Lambert requested they leave their posts because of ""poor decision making and failure to follow (department) pool protocols."" The resignations come in the wake of an investigation into the drowning of Marie Joseph, 36, on June 26. Joseph's body wasn't discovered until the evening of June 30 by teenagers at the pool in Fall River. ""This tragic event leaves heavy hearts in an agency that prides itself on its ability to provide high quality, safe, recreational opportunities for the residents of the Commonwealth,"" Lambert said in a statement. ""We hope that, as an agency, we will continue to work to restore and maintain the public's confidence in our ability to fulfill the mission expected of us by the Governor and residents who visit our facilities."" After Joseph's body was discovered, Lambert ordered the pool closed and appointed a team of officials to investigate her death. The pool's staff as well as the district manager who oversees the pool all were put on administrative leave. The investigation determined that poor water clarity was the primary factor that kept lifeguards from being aware of the drowning and finding Joseph after her death. In fact, the 12-foot-deep pool was so cloudy that it should not have opened the day she drowned, authorities said. Joseph had gone to the pool on Sunday with a 9-year-old neighbor and his family. She collided with the boy while the pair went down a pool slide, said Bristol County District Attorney's spokesman Gregg Miliote. After the collision, the boy surfaced but the woman did not, he said. It was not clear what happened after the collision or whether the boy and his family sought Joseph's whereabouts when they left the pool. A decomposing body can take a couple of days before it becomes buoyant, Miliote added. The investigation is ongoing and the Vietnam Veteran's pool will remain closed, according to Lambert's statement. In the meantime, DCR officials have closed several waterslides throughout the state and imposed new restrictions at public pools. Authorities plan to enact a new water clarity test at pools throughout Massachusetts which requires that a five-inch black disc placed at the bottom of the pool is visible at all times. The state will also require that the ""pool checks"" normally performed by lifeguards from the pool deck include an underwater check as well. CNN's Katie Silver contributed to this report.","Two Massachusetts pool employees and their supervisor are ordered to resign .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. government confirmed Friday the arrest of a U.S. citizen in Syria, a State Department official said. Consular access has not been provided, said the official, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation. Abdelkader Chaar, 22, is thought to have been arrested in Aleppo, Syria, on January 8. Chaar was born in Syracuse, New York, moved to Aleppo with his parents when he was a boy and is currently a medical student at Aleppo University, his uncle said. His family has not been told why he was arrested, said Sam Chaar, who spoke to CNN from Arizona. His family has been in contact with the U.S. Embassy in Damascus and has reached out to Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, the elder Chaar said. News of the arrest surfaced as anti-government ferment raged in the country. Protesters on Friday focused their attention on political prisoners and demanded the release of detainees. At least 10 people were slain in clashes Friday, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an opposition activist group. For more than 10 months, Syria has been in the throes of an anti-government public uprising and a brutal security crackdown against protesters. The United Nations last month estimated well over 5,000 deaths have occurred since mid-March. Opposition groups estimate more than 6,000 people have died. Also, the Arab League is considering an extension of its monitoring mission to see if the government is adhering to an agreement to end the violence. The Arab League has called on President Bashar al-Assad's regime to stop violence against civilians, free political detainees, remove tanks and weapons from cities and allow outsiders, including the international news media, to travel freely around Syria. CNN's Jeremy Ryan contributed to this report.","NEW: Consular access has not been provided, a State Department official says .

"(CNN) -- The Secret Service scandal has all the elements of a salacious story: Sex, alcohol, national security, politics, exotic tropical settings and sex -- or did I already mention sex? But beyond the breathless coverage and oh-so-shocked commentary lie some serious repercussions. The scandal originated in the Colombian city of Cartagena when an agent allegedly refused to pay a local woman the agreed fee of $800 for her sexual services at the historic white-arched hotel where American taxpayers paid for him to sleep while traveling on official duty. Colombia has asked the White House to issue an official apology for tarnishing the country's image. The city of Cartagena, the country's top tourist destination, is a UNESCO world heritage site. Its residents are bristling under the harsh and damaging spotlight. But the government's demand comes in a political year, with President Obama facing criticism that he's too quick to apologize for America. Obama should not apologize. Instead, he should do something much more important, much more useful for all concerned, including the American people. He should take this opportunity to begin taking Latin America seriously. It is sadly symbolic that we now hear about Latin America -- Colombia, and perhaps El Salvador and Argentina -- as places where official representatives of the U.S. government may have crossed the line. The incident and the coverage are emblematic of a low regard for the region. Obama had traveled to Cartagena to attend a Summit of the Americas, a gathering of some 30 presidents and an opportunity for the U.S. to strengthen ties and renew a position of leadership in partnerships with its neighbors. The summit, as it happens, was a disaster for the U.S. Washington emerged isolated and unable to produce any positive results. But, of course, few people in the U.S. noticed, because the news focused on sex, prostitutes and vodka. The U.S. has been ignoring Latin America, at its own peril, while other powers are capitalizing on the region's renaissance. And it's not just the Obama administration. Remember when President George W. Bush declared, ""the U.S. has no more important relationship in the world"" than the one with Mexico? He said it on September 7, 2001. Four days later, on 9/11, Mexico fell off the agenda. But while Washington has remained focused on admittedly urgent problems elsewhere, not everyone else has neglected Latin America. Not long ago, Washington was the region's undisputed top trading partner. Since then, China has moved in. And Beijing has made inroads precisely at the time when Latin America is emerging as a key global player. Also making inroads in Latin America, incidentally, is Iran. China's trade with most countries in Latin America has skyrocketed. Beijing has become Brazil's top economic partner, just as Brazil has emerged as the world's sixth-largest economy, bigger than the UK., Russia or Canada. Washington, meanwhile, delayed and played politics with a free trade agreement with Colombia it signed six years ago. The pact finally goes into effect on May 15. On May 15, Obama should take action. That's the day when the president should announce a new initiative to overhaul America's relations with Colombia and the rest of Latin America. Obama should announce plans to promote trade and tourism, so that people North and South will learn about the other and erase dated stereotypes while spurring prosperity. He should convene a commission to explore innovative ways to combat drug cartels, an urgent issue for the region. And he should leverage America's huge Latino population to link the two sides and highlight a common history. If Obama fails to do this, then Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, should take the lead. Because overhauling relations with Latin America -- improving trade ties, developing stronger person-to-person bonds, coordinating diplomatic and international policies -- will benefit both sides, and it will also earn votes to the candidate who champions the approach. Colombia, as it happens, is the perfect place for Washington's pivot. Time magazine carries a cover story called ""The Colombian Comeback"" on the most recent international edition, featuring a full-page photograph of Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos. That's because Colombia has truly performed a miracle, emerging from half a century of armed conflict and horrific violence to a position of strong economic growth. The Colombian economy grew 6% last year, and it is on track to surpass Argentina to become the second-largest economy in South America. Colombia has recently become a major oil producer. OPEC members are trying to entice it to join the oil cartel. Colombia still has many serious problems, including violence and a great deal of poverty, but it has remained committed to democracy and free markets. Its capital city Bogota is America's best friend in South America. But as in all neglected love affairs, the two have been growing apart. Santos has repaired damaged relations with Venezuela and others in the region. He said that Colombia sees itself as ""a bridge"" between Washington and all of Latin America, including countries with which it does not have good relations. As the American public continues to learn details of the Secret Service scandal -- and you can bet the coverage will not soon die down -- Obama has an opportunity to turn this scandal to everyone's advantage. Don't apologize. Instead, make up for America's failings by changing course. Increase a push for trade so that the U.S. and Latin America can benefit from stronger economic ties and building a hemispheric bloc that makes North and South, together, stronger on the global stage. It will help both sides, and it will also help on Election Day. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","After the Secret Service scandal, Colombia asked President Obama to apologize .

"(CNN) -- The voice is what you end up missing the most. If you've ever had a friend who has meant the world to you, and the friend has died, you'll find yourself half hoping to hear the voice even years after the friend has gone. I have a feeling that there are more than a few of you reading these words today who know exactly what I mean. So it can hit you like a small miracle when, against all odds, the voice of your friend returns. Jack Roth was my best friend from the time we were 5 years old. He died in 2004 at the age of 57; a man who was not a smoker, he nonetheless was cut down by lung cancer. For all those years, from the time we were boys, we never stopped talking to each other, about big things and small. There is not a week that goes by when I don't want to talk with him again. On the cusp of every new summer for the last five years, Jack's wife, his daughter and we who were his friends have held a charity race in his memory through the streets of the central Ohio town where we grew up: the streets he loved. We did it again this year, on a warm and gorgeous Sunday. But there was an additional kind of warmth this year because, in a pair of ways none of us could have predicted, Jack's voice was there with us again. A fellow named Gary Bender discovered an audiotape. When we were all 12 years old, Gary, it seemed, was a member of the audio/visual club at our junior high school. He ran the public address system at assemblies. It turns out that he recorded reel-to-reel tapes during the presentations. Now living in California, he was going through some old boxes recently and found a tape on which boys and girls were being nominated for class offices. Jack had not been nominated. But he placed into nomination for president a boy named Gary Herwald. And now, almost six years after Jack's death, here was Jack's voice in a way I barely remembered it. Nervous, proud, high-pitched, the voice of a 12-year-old standing on a wooden stage: . ""Mr. Stolzenberg, members of the faculty, and the student body ... As you know, I represent Gary Allen Herwald ... Gary has fine leadership abilities ... Gary is kind to all people he encounters, whether it is on the playground, classroom, or athletic field. ..."" The last time I heard Jack's voice, he was dying. The voice was so weak, struggling for air, filled with sadness that he was leaving his wife and daughter behind. So to hear the voice of Jack when life was new, for him and for all of us ... well, I listened to that tape over and over again. My oldest friend, rediscovered. And then I found another version of his voice. Unbeknownst to me, Jack, even in his final months, was writing letters of gratitude to those who had treated him thoughtfully. One of the people to whom he wrote was a man named Gary Zimmerman (I know -- a lot of Garys in this tale), who lives in New York. I had never met Gary Zimmerman, but he sent me a copy of the letter Jack had written to him on October 16, 2004, barely two months before he died. It was pure Jack, full of care: . ""Oh, Gary. That's so kind of you. I just can't tell you what it means to my family and me to know of your feelings for us. Although my life continues to become more difficult and it's harder to see a future that resembles anything like normalcy, I pray that someday we will once again find peace and good health. God bless you for your prayers. ..."" Thus it was with those newly found voices in my ear -- the spoken voice of Jack at 12, trying so hard to do a good job at the nominating assembly, the written voice of Jack at 57, using some of his dwindling energy to send his thanks to a man who had been nice to his family and him -- that I arrived in Ohio for this year's race in his honor. Gary Herwald -- that same Gary Herwald who, half a century ago, Jack had nominated for class president -- had come to town, too, to run in Jack's race. He picked me up and we rode over to the starting line together. When Jack and I were young, there were five of us who were best friends. We called ourselves ABCDJ -- Allen, Bob, Chuck, Dan, Jack. In the town where we lived, there is a community plaza upon which residents and former residents are invited to purchase bricks with their names carved into the surface. Before Jack died, he purchased a brick. But he didn't have his name carved into it. Instead he had those five initials inscribed: ABCDJ. He told me he did it just so there was ""something to show that we were once here."" On race day, I walked to where the brick is. I think I can just about find it with my eyes closed. I looked down at it, and for a moment I did in fact close my eyes and heard again his voice when he was young, his voice when he was dying. If you are lucky, and I know that some of you are, you can do the same thing as you think about your own best friends who now are gone. In the ways that matter, their voices are always present; they have a way of finding you just when you need them the most. Like friendship itself, the voices never die. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: Often it's the voice of a friend that you miss the most .

"(CNN) -- When Butler plays Duke for the national championship of college basketball Monday night, you can count on two things with absolute certainty: . 1. The television ratings for CBS will fall somewhere within the range of really impressive to enormous. 2. You will see commercials featuring famous professional athletes, doing their best to persuade you to purchase the products they are endorsing. Which brings us to a seldom-questioned oddity about contemporary life: . What do you think would happen if there was a highly publicized court case, and the defense lawyer asked the jury to acquit the defendant because of the emotional testimony of an eyewitness -- and the prosecutor announced that the witness had been paid a huge fee by the defense? Would the the jury have any faith in the witness? The witness' testimony would, with good reason, be considered worthless. Or: . How would you feel if you read an ecstatic movie review that made you want to run right down to the theater and buy a ticket -- and then it was reported that the reviewer had received a large check from the movie studio to make sure he gave the film a rave? You'd want your money back. You'd realize that the review meant less than nothing. The reviewer's opinion of the movie was based not on genuinely admiring it, but on being paid to make you think it was good. If it turned out that the critic was taking money to say he liked certain films, his days as a reviewer would be over. And it wouldn't matter if he swore to you that he truly enjoyed the movie, and that the money had nothing to do with it. What if a friend told you that you should go to an allegedly wonderful restaurant, and then you found out that he or she was being paid by the owner to send people there? Chances are that your enthusiasm would wane -- both for the restaurant, and for the friend. This is all elementary. If someone accepts cash in exchange for offering a positive evaluation of something, then the evaluation must be tossed out. It's worse than meaningless. Yet in the arena of celebrity endorsements -- most notably, endorsements by prominent athletes -- not only is the public's disbelief suspended, but people don't seem to particularly care that the recommendation is bought and paid for. When I have tried over the years to make the case for the inherent undependability of these endorsements, people have said that yes, of course, that position is correct -- but that it doesn't matter. When celebrities are paid to say they like something, studies show, it generally translates into increased sales for the companies that hire them. Thus, when a stellar basketball player comes out of college, there is great speculation surrounding the question of what shoe company he will sell his name to, and at what price. Bidding wars develop, and escalate; often the competition is reported in the press, and the winning shoe company celebrates like a presidential candidate who has just found out he has passed the magic number of votes in the Electoral College. Same thing with soft-drink bottlers and energy-bar manufacturers and pain-relief purveyors. The companies know that nothing sells with the public -- and particularly the young male segment of the public -- like a smiling word of affirmation from a top-tier athlete. So one company raises its offer, to be topped by a competing company, to be topped again until there is only one company remaining. And that is when the athlete proclaims to the skies that this is the shoe/soda pop/anti-inflammatory strip that he loves best. You can't blame the athletes for taking the money. Who wouldn't? But at least once in a while, the rest of us may want to step back to consider that this is the kind of recommendation we should trust the least. And that conversely, in a sensible world, the only recommendations in which we should have any faith would be the ones for which athletes and celebrities were paid nothing at all. Not that such an endorsement would ever happen. Try to imagine a commercial that looks like this: . An internationally renowned basketball star is shown in a perfectly framed piece of film footage. He is lighted heroically; he glides down the court, slams home a dunk, turns to the camera and says: . ""I couldn't have done it without my [insert brand name of shoe or energy drink]. And the funny thing is, they told me that they couldn't pay me any money for this commercial. [Brand name of competing shoe or competing energy drink] offered me $40 million over 10 years to tell you that I like their [shoe or energy drink], but the fact is I like this [shoe or energy drink] better. That's why I'm telling you to buy it -- because I buy it, too, and with my own money."" The athlete would likely be declared clinically insane. The world doesn't work that way.

"(CNN) -- The phone-hacking scandal engulfing Rupert Murdoch's media empire intensified in the United States on Wednesday as three senators and a congressman urged federal authorities to investigate whether one of Murdoch's U.S.-based companies may have violated anti-bribery and other laws. A fourth senator told CNN he was considering launching his own investigation into the scandal. Sens. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, and Barbara Boxer, D-California, sent letters to Attorney General Eric Holder asking Holder to look into concerns that News Corp. -- the parent company of Fox News -- violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, known as the FCPA. The law, enacted in 1977, makes it illegal for a U.S. person or company to pay foreign officials to obtain or retain business. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, also wrote to Holder, asking him to examine whether journalists working for Murdoch may have tapped into the phones of the victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Rep. Peter T. King, R-New York, asked FBI Director Robert Mueller to investigate that possibility. Their concerns appear to be traceable to a story published Wednesday by the Mirror, a British tabloid that includes a section it describes as ""gossip gone toxic."" The newspaper cited ""a source"" who referred to a former police officer who now works as a private investigator. ""The investigator is used by a lot of journalists in America and he recently told me that he was asked to hack into the 9/11 victims' private phone data,"" the investigator reportedly told the newspaper. ""He said that the journalists asked him to access records showing the calls that had been made to and from the mobile phones belonging to the victims and their relatives. ""His presumption was that they wanted the information so they could hack into the relevant voice mails, just like has been shown they have done in the UK. The PI said he had to turn the job down. He knew how insensitive such research would be, and how bad it would look. ""The investigator said the journalists seemed particularly interested in getting the phone records belonging to the British victims of the attacks."" News of the World, a 168-year-old British newspaper owned by Murdoch, folded Sunday in the wake of accusations that its reporters illegally eavesdropped on the phone messages of murder and terrorist victims, politicians and celebrities. Police in the United Kingdom have identified almost 4,000 potential targets of phone hacking. There also were reports that reporters may have bribed law enforcement officers. ""The limited information already reported in this case raises serious questions about the legality of the conduct of News Corp. and its subsidiaries under the FCPA,"" Lautenberg wrote. Potential liability flows from journalists at News of the World to its parent, News International, to its parent, News Corp., which is a publicly held company in the United States. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-West Virginia, told CNN Tuesday he may start his own investigation. ""My bet is we'll find some criminal stuff,"" Rockefeller said. ""This is going to be a huge issue."" Rockefeller said he is also concerned about whether journalists tapped into the phones of the 9/11 victims. The Justice Department confirmed Wednesday receipt of letters from Rockefeller, Boxer and Lautenberg. ""We are reviewing the letters,"" said Justice Department spokesperson Laura Sweeney, who declined further comment. Relatives of the victims of the terrorist attacks expressed outrage Wednesday over the possibility they may have been hacking victims. What they went through is ""heartfelt stuff, and it shouldn't be out there for all to see unless the family approves,"" said Jim Riches, a retired New York Fire Department deputy chief who lost a son in the attacks. ""Until we get some accountability, they're just going to keep doing it,"" Riches said. ""It's completely unethical, unprofessional and basically criminal."" Sally Regenhard, who also lost a son in the attacks, called it ""very horrifying that privacy and personal security could be violated in such an egregious manner."" ""This is a big issue and I think it needs to be dealt with head-on,"" she said. ""No one is above the law. ... I want to see real action."" Despite the closure of News of the World, News International still owns The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times in Britain. News Corp. encompasses not only Fox News, but also The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and Harper Collins publishers. ""There does seem to be a basis for a U.S. investigation at this point,"" said Mike Koehler, a professor of business law at Butler University in Indianapolis, in a telephone interview Monday with CNN about whether U.S. law might apply to the hacking scandal in Britain. Mark Rasch, a former Justice Department cybercrimes prosecutor, told CNN a federal investigation ""is certainly appropriate to determine what the facts are."" ""It doesn't matter if the intended victims in the U.S. were Americans or British,"" he said. ""If I hire a (private investigator) to break into the records of people in New York, it doesn't make a difference."" But attorney Richard Cassin, who helps clients comply with the FCPA, said he believes a prosecution is unlikely. ""The chances are very slim unless the payments we know about turn out to be the tip of the iceberg,"" he said. Cassin argued that U.S. authorities are likely to trust the British legal system -- older than America itself -- to handle the case. U.S. authorities usually go after cases that are not being prosecuted elsewhere and in which widespread, systematic bribery can be proved, he said. News Corp., he noted, does not fit the bill. The biggest case for an FCPA violation to date involved the German company Siemens AG, which paid $1.36 billion in bribes to foreign officials working on projects including the United Nations' oil-for-food program in Iraq and others in Nigeria, Bangladesh, China, Russia and Vietnam. The company paid $800 million in fines and penalties for the FCPA violation. But the United States took on that case partly because Germany did not prosecute Siemens, Cassin said, for what amounted to widespread bribery. Were a U.S. case against News Corp. to arise, the potential implications for the Murdoch media empire would be numerous -- and none of them are good, Koehler said. An investigation would most certainly attempt to answer the question of how widespread bribes were within News Corp. Were other employees -- all over the world, for that matter -- making similar payments? The FCPA stipulates that U.S.-listed companies, their employees or agents may not make bribes to foreign officials. A second portion of the law applies to accounting requirements for public companies, said Don Zarin, author of ""Doing Business Under The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act"" and a partner with the Washington-based law firm of Holland & Knight. ""They have to keep books and records in reasonable detail that reflect the transactions,"" he said. So, if a bribe was made and not properly noted, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department could each have a case, Zarin said. A telephone call or an e-mail from an editor in London to his or her boss in New York could prove key, he said. ""If you send an e-mail to the boss saying, 'I'm going to pay $10,000 to police officers for this information,' that would provide the jurisdictional basis or potential liability on the part of possibly the British employees,"" Zarin said. If any employee of News Corp., which is listed in the United States, knew about and authorized such a payment, ""they could have potential exposure,"" he said. And if Murdoch -- the 80-year-old Australian-born head of News Corp. who became a U.S. citizen in 1985 -- knew what was going on and authorized it, even implicitly, ""he could have some potential exposure,"" Zarin said. The penalties can be severe, including jail time and fines, he said. And ignorance confers no protection. ""The SEC has brought cases against U.S. companies who had no knowledge of what foreign subsidiaries were doing, but had misbooked it,"" he said, adding that the SEC blamed the companies for not having set up the internal controls that would have caught the illegal behavior. A Justice spokeswoman said she could not comment on the possibility of the department's involvement. If the charges wind up being nothing more than civil accounting violations, the SEC would handle the case and Justice would not become involved, said James Tillen, coordinator of the FCPA Practice Group at Miller and Chevalier, a Washington-based law firm specializing in international regulatory issues, tax and litigation. That would still carry a major risk to those involved. ""The SEC has a lot of bite in significant fines, penalties, prohibiting people from serving as officers in public companies,"" he said. ""That can derail a career quickly."" But a criminal prosecution by federal prosecutors would be the most to fear, since it would carry the potential of jail time, Tillen said. SEC fines can range up to $25 million per violation in such cases, but totals regularly exceed $100 million because the agency can force the company to disgorge ill-gotten gains. The Justice Department can impose a criminal fine on individuals of up to $100,000 and five years in prison for each count on a bribery charge, he said. Multiple counts could lead to higher fines and sequential prison terms. But fines are typically pegged to how much a company or an individual gained as a result of the crime, Tillen said. That can be easy to figure out when the subject is a contract, but any case involving Murdoch's empire might present more of a challenge. ""How many more newspapers did you sell?"" he asked.

"London (CNN) -- Two key executives in Rupert Murdoch's media empire resigned Friday, and their former boss added public relations muscle as he began a series of apologies in the phone-hacking scandal. Out are Rebekah Brooks, chief executive of News International, and her predecessor in the job, Les Hinton, who most recently served as chief executive of Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal. Hinton wrote Murdoch that he had seen reports of actual and alleged misconduct when he was executive chairman of News International, which operated the now-defunct News of the World. ""The pain caused to innocent people is unimaginable,"" Hinton said in a letter provided by Dow Jones. ""That I was ignorant of what apparently happened is irrelevant and in the circumstances I feel it is proper for me to resign from News Corp., and apologize to those hurt by the actions of the News of the World."" For his part, Murdoch began a campaign of contrition and reform Friday, apologizing to the family of a murdered British teenager whose voicemail allegedly was hacked by staffers of News of the World. ""As the founder of the company, I was appalled to find out what happened,"" Murdoch said after speaking with relatives of Milly Dowler, 13, who went missing and was later found dead. ""Of course I apologized."" Murdoch will offer a broader apology to those whose privacy may have been violated by journalists in an ad that is to appear in newspapers Saturday. Police in the United Kingdom have identified almost 4,000 potential targets of phone hacking. There were also allegations that News Corp. reporters may have bribed law enforcement officers. Some of the claims Brooks faces relate to the News of the World's alleged hacking, while she was editor, into Dowler's mobile phone account. Staffers were accused of intercepting messages in search of news. They then allegedly deleted messages to keep Dowler's mailbox from filling up, giving her family and friends false hope that the schoolgirl was still alive. The family's attorney, Mark Lewis, said the family will seek ""legal remedies"" after their ordeal. ""They were suffering private grief,"" Lewis said. ""People were intruding into it."" Murdoch appeared humble and sincere during the meeting, Lewis added. ""He apologized many times."" Murdoch's News of the World, a 168-year-old tabloid that was Britain's biggest Sunday newspaper, folded over the weekend in the wake of accusations that its reporters illegally eavesdropped on the phone messages of murder and terrorism victims, politicians and celebrities. ""We are sorry for the serious wrongdoing that occurred,"" Murdoch will say in Saturday's ad. ""We are deeply sorry for the hurt suffered by the individuals affected."" ""The News of the World was in the business of holding others to account. It failed when it came to itself,"" according to text of the ad provided by News International, which will also express regret for not acting more quickly ""to sort things out."" Murdoch will say in the ad that he realizes that apologizing is not enough and he pledges concrete action. British Prime Minister David Cameron has been among those publicly decrying the hacking, blasting Murdoch's company Wednesday as he launched a high-powered investigation into the nation's press. Yet he has his own ties to the scandal, given his relationship with Andy Coulson. Coulson quit as News of the World editor in 2007, after his former royal editor and a private detective were convicted of conspiracy to hack into royals' voicemails. But even while offering his resignation, he claimed to be unaware of the crimes and he was not charged at the time. Months later, Coulson joined up with Cameron, then the Conservative Party leader. After last year's election, Cameron rose to prime minister -- and took Coulson with him, as his communications director. Coulson worked from Downing Street through January, when he resigned as Cameron's spokesman when the scandal blew up afresh. Cameron hosted Coulson overnight in March at Chequers, the prime minister's country estate, a Downing Street source said Friday. The aim of the invite, added the source, was to thank his former communications director for his work on Cameron's behalf. Then, earlier this month, Coulson was himself arrested in connection with claims of phone hacking and corruption dating to his days as the News of the World editor. After the arrest, the prime minister took full responsibility for hiring Coulson. But while not denying this personal connection, Cameron has maintained public pressure against News Corp. This is just one of a flurry of dizzying developments related to the scandal in recent days. News Corp., which has been at the center of the storm, has hired the firm Edelman to handle its public relations and prominent U.S. attorney Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. to help navigate. One brick to fall Friday was Brooks, who had been under pressure to step down. A chief executive of News International, she was News of the World editor at the time of some of the most serious allegations against the newspaper. ""As chief executive of the company, I feel a deep sense of responsibility for the people we have hurt, and I want to reiterate how sorry I am for what we now know to have taken place,"" Brooks said in a statement through News International. ""I have believed that the right and responsible action has been to lead us through the heat of the crisis. However, my desire to remain on the bridge has made me a focal point of the debate."" She said that the focus on her is ""detracting attention"" from endeavors to fix the problems and that her resignation gives her more time to fight the allegations against her. Cameron believes that Brooks' resignation was the right decision, a Downing Street spokesman said. Opposition Labour leader Ed Miliband said he was pleased she had ""finally taken responsibility for the terrible events that happened on her watch, like the hacking of Milly Dowler's phone."" Former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, who says police now tell him his phone was hacked 44 times, also welcomed Brooks' resignation. ""She seems to be the center of all of it, and yet she keeps saying 'Not me' -- that seems to be the common line at News International,"" he said, adding that her resignation is ""a decent step towards getting better and decent reporting in this country."" Prescott described Murdoch as a ""spider in the middle of this web"" and said it was ""about time we took him on rather than running away from him."" Campaign group Hacked Off, which has been calling for a full inquiry into alleged phone hacking by News of the World, said: ""The key issue is not however whether Rebekah Brooks is in work, but whether she lied to Parliament, told the full truth to the police or was engaged in a massive cover-up. That is what we want. The victims want to know."" James Murdoch, Rupert's son and chairman of News International, thanked Brooks for ""her 22 years of service to the company"" and said he understood her decision to resign. ""She has been one of the outstanding editors of her generation and she can be proud of many accomplishments as an executive. We support her as she takes this step to clear her name,"" he said in a statement. ""We will follow this up in the future with communications about the actions we have taken to address the wrongdoing that occurred,"" he said. A day before she resigned, Brooks agreed to attend a hearing before British lawmakers Tuesday into the phone-hacking scandal. However, she said her answers might be limited by ongoing police and judicial inquiries. James and Rupert Murdoch confirmed late Thursday that they would also appear at the July 19 hearing before the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, after initially declining to attend. In Friday's statement, James Murdoch said he and his father would speak to the committee ""directly about our determination to put things right. The company has made mistakes. It is not only receiving appropriate scrutiny, but is also responding to unfair attacks by setting the record straight."" Tom Mockridge will replace Brooks, News Corp. said Friday. Mockridge is a former newspaper journalist who has been the chief executive of Sky Italia since 2003. Murdoch said Mockridge is an ""outstanding executive with unrivalled experience across our journalism and television businesses."" Meanwhile, the FBI is investigating News Corp. after a report that employees or associates may have tried to hack into phone conversations and voice mail of September 11 survivors, victims and their families. Murdoch's News Corp. encompasses Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and Harper Collins publishers in the United States. News International -- a British subsidiary of News Corp. -- owns the Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times in Britain.

"London (CNN) -- Police have arrested the man believed to be at the center of a security alert Friday that closed a major shopping street in central London, a police spokesman said. After the arrest, officers searched the building on Tottenham Court Road to make sure it was safe, the Metropolitan Police said. No hostages have been identified, police said. ""After contact with our specialist police negotiators the man came out of the building, and was arrested,"" Commander Mak Chishty said in a written statement. ""He is now in police custody. ""Items were thrown from the window onto the street below,"" Chishty added. ""We were concerned that he may have explosive materials or flammable liquids with him. Our immediate concern was for the safety of the people inside the building and for the general public in the vicinity. ""During the course of the incident a number of people who were inside the building left peacefully,"" he said. Earlier unconfirmed eyewitness reports suggested the man might have had some kind of canister attached to his body and had threatened to explode it. A Metropolitan Police spokesman earlier told CNN the police did not know if the man, age 49, was armed. Officers carrying some kind of weapons -- it is not clear whether they were live firearms or stun guns -- were sent to the scene. Police do not commonly carry firearms in Britain. A vehicle labeled ""police explosive search dogs"" also arrived and dogs could be seen on the closed-off street. A 300-meter (980-foot) cordon was put in place on Tottenham Court Road, London's Metropolitan Police said. The police declined to confirm reports that a sniper was positioned on a nearby roof. The alarm was first raised around noon, with reports of a man causing a disturbance and throwing objects from an upper floor window. Police said electrical equipment was among the items tossed to the street below. Unconfirmed eyewitness reports suggest the man entered an office building housing an employment agency. The man, who appeared to be unstable, had some kind of canister strapped to him and threatened to blow it up, the witnesses said. A police spokesman confirmed the force had received reports from the public suggesting the man had canisters attached to him but said officers could not confirm that themselves. A tweet from the Metropolitan Police said: ""There are no reported injuries and it's unclear if other people in the building."" A number of buildings in the area have been evacuated and half a dozen ambulances are at the scene. They have not yet been put to use. The incident caused major disruption on a street usually busy with traffic, shoppers and local workers on their lunch break. ""We advise people to keep clear of the area due to congestion,"" the police said via Twitter. Warren Street Underground station has been closed at the request of the police, Transport for London said. Goodge Street Underground station, which was closed because of the alert, was reopened shortly after the arrest. Buildings used by students at University College London and a big London hospital are in the area. The alert comes three months ahead of the Olympic Games in London, when a major security operation will be in place. CNN's Raja Razek, Nic Robertson and Claudia Rebaza contributed to this report.","NEW: ""After contact with our specialist police negotiators the man came out,"" police say .

"(CNN) -- It is true many Iraqis celebrated the fall of Saddam Hussein but few expected they would be held hostage to policies over which they -- the Iraqi people -- had no say but for which they would still have to pay the price. It is nearly impossible to put into words what this nation has gone through, the bloodshed, the psychological impact of living nine years of war -- a war that isn't over yet. Nahla al-Nadawi, like tens of thousands of other Iraqis, knows the bitter cold feel of death too well. ""I have the courage to say that I was happy when the Americans arrived, but then I have hundreds of questions,"" Nahla says. ""Why did the Americans make so many mistakes? Was it out of ignorance about Iraq or was it deliberate?"" ""The Americans are leaving us fragile. They haven't even planted the seeds that would give us hope that we are heading towards democracy, rule of law and civil society,"" she says. Her husband, Mohammed, was killed in a bombing back in 2007. He was a doctor, and the couple had returned to Iraq following the fall of Saddam Hussein because they felt their country needed them. There were 10 bodies, charred and melted together at the morgue that day in April. Nahla had to identify the man she calls the love of her life from a pin in his knee. ""Suddenly this scorched thing is the same thing that used to be a beating heart, standing next to you in life,"" she told us, pain etched across her face. Those steps towards the hospital morgue played out over and over again in her mind. ""I remember a blue colored sheet covering something. At one end the pigtails of a little girl with red ribbons, on the other a tiny foot. The sheet was drenched in blood. At that moment I forgot why I was standing there, I was crying for all those other people,"" she says. Looking at photos from 2007 Nahla says it's as if she was wearing a cloak of death. Life back then became black and white. Now its bursting with color again, but inside she says she still carries the pain. Her nine-year-old son Ussayid is her source of happiness. He's autistic, but just this year transferred from a special needs school into a regular one. But even he can't escape the pervasiveness of death. Every morning he recites a list of people who died and how, starting with his father. She says: ""And when he draws, he draws a cloud and rain and then paints over it all with black,"" Nahla says. ""This child who seems happy on the surface carries a darkness inside because of the death of his father, the death of so many of our friends. ""I love people, I love them so much. If I have someone in the car with me, as soon as they leave, I put my hand down to feel the heat left by their body, to feel life."" Standing next to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki last week, President Barack Obama congratulated the Iraqi leader. ""The prime minister leads Iraq's most inclusive government yet,"" he said. In his address to troops at Fort Bragg, Obama heralded the end of the war as a ""moment of success."" But success is hardly a word most Iraqis, even those who rabidly opposed Saddam Hussein, would associate with the U.S. war in Iraq. One is hard pressed to find a family that hasn't lost a loved one be it to American bombs, attacks by al Qaeda and other insurgent groups, or the sectarian bloodletting that tore this nation apart. The majority of the Iraqi population is still struggling to come to terms with the rampant violence that shattered entire communities and turned neighbor on neighbor as streets they once used to laugh and share jokes in turned into battlefields. The Iraqi government began to show signs of crumbling even before the last U.S. soldier left Iraqi soil. The Iraqiya bloc headed by former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi announced Saturday that it was suspending its participation in parliament because of a lack of power-sharing. The bloc accuses Prime Minister al-Maliki of consolidating power. Al-Maliki still holds full control over the security portfolio which includes the ministries of defense and interior. Furthermore, since the end of October the Iraqi security forces have rounded up hundreds of people it accuses of being Ba'athists and terrorists. Iraqiya says the majority of those people are its members or supporters and charges that al-Maliki is simply taking out his opponents one by one. Ali al-Mussawi, media adviser to the prime minister, told CNN Saturday that the government had confessions linking Tareq al-Hashimi, the Sunni vice president and a member of Iraqiya, to bombings. But no more information was made public and no arrest warrant was issued, amid warnings that such a move would certainly thrust the country towards yet another violent abyss. A few days earlier, another ranking Sunni, Deputy Prime Minister Saleh al-Mutlaq, told CNN that al-Maliki was nothing less than a dictator himself adding: ""Al-Maliki is playing a game between Iran and the U.S.. There will be a day when the U.S. realizes that they were deceived by al-Maliki and they will regret that."" According to Iraqi state TV, al-Maliki -- who heads the rival predominantly Shia bloc -- is asking parliament for a no confidence vote to remove al-Mutlaq from power. The Iraqi people continue to be the victim of both their own country's policies and those of the country -- America -- that directly or indirectly promised them a better life after Saddam Hussein. Mona Adnan, 29, moans as she lies in bed in her dark room. She can no longer get up on her own. ""I just want my leg, I don't want anything else,"" she sobs as her elderly father wipes the tears off her face. ""I don't even have money for medication. My family is poor, we have to pay rent, my mother and father are sick."" Mona used to work just outside her home selling hot sugary tea. She was the sole breadwinner for her impoverished family but a month ago a bomb ripped through the marketplace blowing off one of her legs. There are hundreds of thousands of war wounded, and according to the Ministry of Health, about 25 percent of them are amputees. ""What did this girl do to deserve this?"" her father laments, tears welling in his eyes. ""What has she done, what? Her whole future is gone."" The war may be over, but only for America. In the moments after the last American convoy departed from Iraq, one of our Iraqi colleagues, echoing a thought we'd heard time and time again, said: ""We thank the U.S. for getting rid of Saddam, but not for anything that happened afterwards.""","While the war is over for America, Iraq must deal with a country still racked by violence .
Iraqis must heal the scars left by nine years of war that left more than 100,000 dead .
The Iraqi government has shown signs of crumbling even before the last U.S. soldier left ."
"London (CNN) -- Three men convicted in a London gang shooting that left a little girl paralyzed were sentenced to life in prison Thursday, the Metropolitan Police said. The plight of Thusha Kamaleswaran, whose last carefree moments before she was caught in the crossfire last year were captured on surveillance video, touched many hearts in the United Kingdom. Now six, she remains in a wheelchair and will need care for the rest of her life, her parents say. The three men convicted, Anthony McCalla, Kazeem Kolawole and Nathaniel Grant, were all given life sentences by the court in London. The judge ordered that Grant serve a minimum of 17 years in prison, and McCalla and Kolawole a minimum of 14 years, before they are eligible for parole. The surveillance video used in their conviction last month showed Thusha, then a shy five-year-old with pigtails, dancing happily in the aisles of her uncle's small store in Stockwell, southwest London. Moments later, she was knocked down by a bullet to the chest fired through the store's open door by the three men as they pursued members of a rival gang. A statement given to the court by Thusha's mother, Sharmilla Kamaleswaran, spells out the impact the tragedy has had on the family. ""I cannot begin to explain the shock that I felt at the time of the shooting. We were at the shop as a family enjoying seeing relatives. The children were happy, running up and down the shop, playing and dancing. Seconds later I had to see Thusha lying on the floor, crying, telling me she couldn't feel her legs."" The ordeal has continued with her daughter's surgeries and her daily struggle with pain, Sharmilla Kamaleswaran said. ""To see her lying in a hospital bed just took all of my heart away. My other children were crying. They couldn't understand why this had happened. I cannot think of a worse time in my life,"" she said. A year later, Thusha's younger sister prays every day for her sister to ""get up and walk as before,"" their mother said. Meanwhile, Thusha's dreams of becoming a dancer and musician have evaporated. ""It is hard for all at home to see an innocent child who had been hopping around like a little rabbit, playing with her siblings and friends, now paralyzed for life,"" Sharmilla Kamaleswaran said. The three men convicted at the Old Bailey court were tracked down after detectives viewed more than 700 hours of closed-circuit footage seized from more than 150 cameras, the police said. A 35-year-old man, Roshan Selvakumar, was also struck in the March 2011 attack as he shopped for groceries. He has bullet fragments still lodged in his head that cannot safely be removed. ""The images of Thusha dancing happily in the Stockwell Food and Wine are images that many of us will struggle to erase from our memories,"" said Det. Supt. Gordon Allison. ""Today, McCalla, Kolawole and Grant will have many years in prison to reflect on the damage they caused to an innocent five-year-old girl and her family but also Roshan and the community that is London as a whole."" Several Metropolitan Police officers who worked on the case are undertaking a charity trek to raise money for Thusha's care later this year and have already raised more than $207,000 in donations, he said.","Three men convicted of a shooting that paralyzed a 5-year-old girl are given life sentences .

"(CNN) -- Although the war in Bosnia began on April 6,1992, my involvement in the conflict didn't start until July 23, when CNN photojournalist Margaret Moth was shot by a sniper and nearly killed. I was part of a CNN team sent in to replace my wounded colleague and spent more than two years covering the story. Last week, the 20th anniversary of the conflict, I returned to Sarajevo for a reunion of journalists who covered the war. While Margaret was being medivaced to a hospital in London, I arrived in the Bosnian capital on a United Nations flight from Zagreb, Croatia. When I landed I saw another U.N. aircraft unloading on the tarmac nearby. It had a delegation from Belgrade that included Yugoslavian Prime Minister Milan Panic. He was attempting to find ways to end the war. Many crews were covering Panic's trip, including one from ABC. I recognized reporter Sam Donaldson and producer David Kaplan. I'd known both of them while covering presidential trips during the Reagan Administration. While I was busy collecting my gear, Donaldson and a cameraman got into an armored U.N. transport with Panic and headed into the city. The vehicle was too small to include Kaplan, but a few minutes later another television crew offered him a ride into Sarajevo in their 'soft-skinned' van, with TV written in black tape across the back. Kaplan jumped in but did not have a bullet-resistant vest, so he was seated between two other journalists who were wearing protective gear. Moments after leaving the airport a shot rang out. A sniper had hit the van between the letters T and V. The bullet went through the tailgate into the rear seat and killed Kaplan. This tragic scene was the first of many memories I would collect during a war that would last nearly four years. Last year, a couple of veteran reporters having drinks at a bar decided to mark the 20th anniversary of the Siege of Sarajevo with a reunion of war journalists. Since I had spent nearly two and a half years on the ground during the war, I was invited. I had no idea what to expect. I hadn't been back to the war-ravaged city since the Dayton accords were signed in 1995, officially ending the conflict. This time I flew into the airport on a commercially scheduled airline, not a military transport. The military aircraft, U.N. workers, and tons of relief supplies present for the longest humanitarian airlift in history had faded into the past. Instead of loading into an armored car, I secured a local taxi to drive into the city. I thought about the countless times our team would confront the challenges of the dreaded airport road and was happy no one had to worry about it any more. I also thought about David Kaplan and his family. I always rolled tape while traveling the lengthy stretch of road from the airport into the city. I wanted a visual record in case I got hit. I decided to record the trip again, so I could compare images from then and now. The abandoned tank, disabled early in the war, was no longer on the side of the road. Instead, the street was lined with small shops and businesses. Some of the buildings were still scarred by the intense fighting that occurred, but now pedestrians walked up and down the busy thoroughfare. When snipers were present, we used to drive as fast as the armored car was capable of going. This time, thankfully, there was so much traffic on the road that the trip seemed to take forever. I enjoyed every minute of it. Inside the city there were new large apartment block, shopping malls and a renovated tram system filled with riders. What was the biggest change I saw? How about a drive-thru McDonalds on a former snipers' alley! Some people might have a problem with an American fast food restaurant in the heart of Sarajevo but the folks working there expressed pleasure at just having a job. On the way to the Holiday Inn, which was the main gathering place for the international press corps during the siege, both sides of the street were crowded with families walking under a warm afternoon sun. Along the way there were also stark reminders of the war. The Rainbow Hotel, where U.N. personnel once lived, was a burned out shell. It was near there where Margaret was shot. As I arrived at the Holiday Inn I was pleased to see it had been renovated to how it looked before the war. Built as a host hotel for the 1984 Winter Olympics, the Holiday Inn was heavily damaged by artillery and tank shells. It had been a focal point for sniper and small arms fire. Rocket propelled grenades had routinely hit the hotel's exterior walls. Now, the windows were intact, electricity and water restored. We no longer had to cross no-mans-land from back roads into the underground garage to avoid snipers. As I entered the lobby I soon noticed one thing hadn't changed. Everywhere I looked I saw the same hotel staff that we bonded with during the war. They were all older, of course, but looked a lot healthier and seemed truly happy to reconnect with the returning journalists. Broad smiles and misty eyes preceded huge hugs as former friendships were recalled. I felt like I had never left. For the anniversary of the start of the war the city of Sarajevo decided to memorialize the occasion by lining up 11,541 red chairs in rows, filling the main street in the city center. Each empty chair represented a man, woman or child who was killed during the 44 month siege. When I heard about the project it didn't have much of an impact on me. When I saw it, I was overwhelmed. The empty seats went on and on, around the corner and off into the distance. Red banners with white numbers, 11,541, were attached to poles along the route on both sides of the street. In the section dedicated to children there were about 1,600 smaller chairs. Friends and relatives carefully and reverently placed flowers, stuffed animals and mementos on the empty seats as a light rain fell. Towards the end of the service a choir, filled with children's voices, sang the anti-war standard, ""Give Peace a Chance."" Even some of my most battle-hardened war journalist friends admitted the moisture on their faces didn't come from the rain. It's a lot easier to rebuild structures than heal ethnic divides magnified by atrocities of war but I am hopeful Sarajevo and Bosnia are heading in the right direction.","CNN photojournalist David Rust returned to Bosnia for the first time since the war .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal are used to meeting in grand slam finals, but the dominance of Novak Djokovic in 2011 means the two great rivals will feature in the same half of the draw for the first time in seven years at the Australian Open. The former world No. 1s, who have clashed in eight title deciders, could meet in the semifinals of the tennis season's opening major, which begins in Melbourne on Monday. Federer, seeking to extend his record of 16 grand slam titles, will start against a qualifier, as will Nadal -- bidding for his 11th elite crown. Defending champion Djokovic, however, will start out against Italy's 108th-ranked Paolo Lorenzi as he starts a campaign that could see him meet last year's runner-up Andy Murray in the last four. Fourth seed Murray, who lost to Federer in the 2010 final, begins against American 19-year-old Ryan Harrison, ranked 84th. In the women's draw, world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki is top seed for the sixth grand slam in a row. The Dane, who is yet to win one of the four grand slams, starts off against Australia's Anastasia Rodionova. Second seed Petra Kvitova, who could move to the top of the world rankings in Melbourne, has been drawn to face world No. 84 Vera Dushevina of Russia. Sixth seed Samantha Stosur, who became Australia's first winner of a women's grand slam singles title in 31 years at the 2011 U.S. Open, will play Romania's 60th-ranked Sorana Cirstea.

"(CNN) -- The Nigerian contender to head the World Bank, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, said Wednesday she is ready to lead from day one and would make it a nimbler, more responsive organization. Okonjo-Iweala told CNN's Richard Quest she was the best candidate for the job because of her 25 years working at the bank and her time as Nigerian finance minister. This has given her experience on both sides of the table, she said, and means she could hit the ground running. ""You don't want to spend six months, a year, learning how the institution functions before you can lead -- I can lead from the word go,"" she said, speaking from Delhi, India. President Barack Obama on Friday presented Dr. Jim Yong Kim, the president of Dartmouth College, as the U.S. nominee for the role. While the World Bank's influence is felt most directly in the developing world, an American has always headed the bank. The organization expects to pick the new president by its spring meeting in the week of April 16. Okonjo-Iweala said she welcomed the competition posed by Kim, whose background is in medicine, not economics or business as has been the case with most previous World Bank presidents. ""I am not daunted ... because the shareholders of the World Bank promised a fair, merit-based, open and competitive process,"" she said. Okonjo-Iweala, a Harvard-educated economist and former senior World Bank official, said her role as head of the Nigerian finance ministry had provided a valuable practical grounding. ""This is not theory you are dealing with, it's fact, it's experience, it's real world, 'how do we make a policy decision that will help millions of poor people today?' -- so that gives me a lot,"" she said. She said her chief aim if picked to lead the bank would be to make it a faster and nimbler organization, able to respond swiftly to problems in developing countries. The bank should also focus on promoting growth in developing nations to create jobs, especially for young people, she said. ""I've never met a poor person who didn't want the dignity of a job -- if they have a job, they can take care of their health problems, their education problems,"" she said. As World Bank leader, she would also give the emerging market nations a voice on the global stage, Okonjo-Iweala said, and reflect a changing world where those countries are increasingly contributing to growth. She was nominated by South Africa and has the support of other African nations. Antonio Ocampo, formerly the finance minister of Colombia, has also been nominated. Kim, a Korean American, has previously served as a senior official at the World Health Organization. The World Bank was created along with the International Monetary Fund in 1944 to help the Allied powers shape the post-World War II economic order. It now includes 187 member states, offering loans and grants as well as technical expertise for development projects around the world. Under a tacit agreement in place since their inception, an American has always led the World Bank while a European has been in charge of the IMF. The World Bank and the IMF get funding from their members, also known as shareholders, and it is this funding that is the basis for voting power on the organizations' boards. The board will vote on the new leader for the bank, but it is widely assumed that the U.S. nominee will be the one confirmed by the full body. As the largest contributor to the World Bank and the IMF, the United States has the most voting shares on their boards at roughly 16%. The United States and Europe together have roughly half these shares, and have long been able to impose their will in matters of leadership.","Nigerian Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala is Africa's choice for the top job at the World Bank .

"(CNN) -- A group of Portuguese-speaking countries condemned a coup that has roiled the tiny nation of Guinea-Bissau, plunging the African country into more chaos after nearly four decades of instability. Foreign ministers from the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries group discussed the coup at a gathering in Lisbon, Portugal, on Saturday. Guinea-Bissau is a member of the group, which also includes Portugal, Angola, Mozambique and Brazil. Coups and coup attempts are common in Guinea-Bissau since it won its independence from Portugal in 1974. In the latest coup, soldiers took Acting President Raimundo Pereira and Prime Minister Carlos Gomes Jr. into custody Thursday night, sparking international condemnation. Both leaders are well and alive, said Daba Naualna, a spokesman for the army's chief of staff. He said a group called the military command was behind the arrests, though it was unclear who its members are. Leaders of the nation's armed forces have taken control of the nation to ensure stability, according to the spokesman. ""The (army chief of staff) thinks, for the sake of the country, that power cannot fall into the streets and decided to have (the military) play its part in seeking solutions with the political class to resolve this crisis,"" he said. Military leaders have said they have no desire to ""stay in power"" and have asked political parties to send ideas on what to do next by Sunday, the spokesman said. A meeting is expected to take place Sunday to discuss the proposals. World leaders condemned the coup, which occurred just before the second round of a presidential election set for April 29. The African Union, the United Nations and the United States called for a return to civilian rule and demanded the release of the leaders. U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the United States was ""deeply concerned"" about the safety of residents. ""We urge all parties to put down their weapons, release government leaders immediately, and restore the legitimate civilian leadership,"" Toner said. ""We remain deeply concerned about the safety of the country's interim president, senior figures, and others who may be put in harm's way because of these actions,"" the White House said in a statement. In a statement, the military command said the revolt was in response to a ""secret deal"" between the government and Angola. This ""deal"" was drawn up to allow Angolan troops in the country to attack Guinea-Bissau's military, a communique from the group said. This group says the acting president and the prime minister signed the deal and also accuses the African Union -- whose rotating presidency is currently held by Angola -- of supporting intervention by Angolan forces. Guinea-Bissau's history has been marked by several military coups, and these conflicts have ravaged its infrastructure and economy, leaving it among the poorest in the world. The nation's first round of voting in a presidential election was held in March, and campaigning for the second round was about to begin. The election was prompted by the death of the incumbent Malam Bacai Sanha in January after a long illness. Residences of the prime minister and some government ministers were looted, witnesses said. Public media outlets are under the control of the army and are regularly broadcasting statements from the military, witnesses said Friday. Angola, also a former Portuguese colony, issued a statement last week saying it would unilaterally withdraw its troops. A number of Angolan troops are in the country to help reform the country's armed forces, Angola said. Sanha had become president in September 2009 after the assassination of his predecessor. Despite his coming to power in what international observers deemed a fair and peaceful election, his tenure was marked by turmoil among the country's military and political leadership. To date, no democratically elected president of the country has served a full, five-year term. CNN's Marilia Brocchetto, Umaro Djau, Kim Chakanetsa and David McKenzie and contributed to this report.","An international group says it rejects any government announced by the coup leaders .

"(CNN) -- I want to translate the Web into every major language: every webpage, every video, and, yes, even Justin Bieber's tweets. With its content split up into hundreds of languages -- and with over 50% of it in English -- most of the Web is inaccessible to most people in the world. This problem is pressing, now more than ever, with millions of people from China, Russia, Latin America and other quickly developing regions entering the Web. In this TED talk, I introduce my new project, called Duolingo, which aims at breaking the language barrier, and thus making the Web truly ""world wide."" We have all seen how systems such as Google Translate are improving every day at translating the gist of things written in other languages. Unfortunately, they are not yet accurate enough for my purpose: Even when what they spit out is intelligible, it's so badly written that I can't read more than a few lines before getting a headache. This is why you don't see machine-translated articles on CNN. With Duolingo, our goal is to encourage people, like you and me, to translate the Web into their native languages. Now, with billions and billions of pages on the Web, this can't be done with just a few volunteers, nor can we afford to pay professional translators. When Severin Hacker and I started Duolingo, we realized we needed a way to entice millions of people to help translate the Web. However, coordinating millions of contributors to translate language presents two major hurdles. First, finding enough people who are bilingual enough to help with translation is difficult. Second, motivating them to do it for free makes this next to impossible. The idea behind Duolingo is to kill two birds with one stone by solving both of these problems simultaneously. We accomplish this by transforming language translation into something that anyone can do -- not just bilinguals -- and that millions of people want to do: learning a foreign language. It is estimated that over one billion people worldwide are learning a foreign language, with millions doing so using computer programs. With Duolingo, people learn a foreign language while simultaneously translating text. When you learn on Duolingo, the website gives you exercises tailored specifically to you that teach you every aspect of the new language. You may be asked to translate a sentence, to pronounce or listen to a phrase, or to describe what you see in an image. Some of the sentences you translate come from real websites. By having multiple students translate each sentence, and then choosing the best one, Duolingo produces translations that are as accurate as those from professional language translators. Because you create valuable translations as a side effect, learning on Duolingo is 100% free: no ads, no hidden fees, no subscriptions. Duolingo entails a new business model that allows anyone online, regardless of socioeconomic status, to have access to education. For example, the leading language-learning software sells for over $500, which is beyond the means of the majority of the world's population. If language education is offered free of charge in exchange for students' performing useful tasks, those who cannot afford to pay with money pay with their time -- time that would have been spent learning anyway. This is how I want to translate the Web. Now go on and sign up for Duolingo.

"Juba, South Sudan (CNN) -- Clashes erupted Monday on the volatile border between Sudan and South Sudan in the run-up to a planned meeting between the nations' presidents as part of a troubled peace process. South Sudan army spokesman Philip Aguer accused Khartoum of launching aerial bombing raids on troops in Jaw, a border area where their armies have clashed previously. He said Sudanese ground forces attacked a southern base near the Heglig oil field. ""They repelled the attack, they pursued them to Heglig. The SPLA is controlling part of Heglig,"" he said, referring to South Sudan's army. Sudan denied that its air force bombed Jaw, and said the border clashes near Heglig were ""minor"". Part of Heglig is disputed, along with much of the 1,200-mile border. Sudan President Omar al-Bashir is scheduled to travel to the southern capital on April 3 to meet with his counterpart, South Sudan President Salva Kiir, and sign a deal on border demarcation. Under that agreement, the countries would establish a joint committee and technical team to mark the border. Another agreement would guarantee the rights of citizens from each country living on either side of the border. The accords are considered landmark achievements, reached after eight months of negotiations that began after South Sudan broke away from Sudan and declared independence July 9. The split, which came after two decades of civil war, left a raft of unresolved issues, including how much the landlocked south should pay to transport its oil through a pipeline running across Sudan. South Sudan shut down oil production in late January after accusing its northern neighbor of stealing $815 million of its oil. Sudan said it confiscated the crude to make up for unpaid fees to use the pipeline and processing facilities in its territory. Pagan Amum, the south's chief negotiator, said the border and citizenship agreements could open the way to a deal to resume oil production. Both countries are suffering economically since the shutdown began. Upon independence, South Sudan took three-quarters of the formerly united country's oil reserves, and oil accounted for 98% of the new state's revenues. Monday's border clashes cast doubt on whether either country would honor any agreements. During talks mediated by the African Union, the countries also signed a nonaggression pact on February 10 aimed at bringing peace to the border region. Aside from clashes between government forces, both countries accuse each other of supporting militia or rebel forces in their territories. On Thursday, U.S. State Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland urged South Sudan to cease military support for rebels fighting the Khartoum government in Blue Nile state and Southern Kordofan state, where Monday's clashes occurred. Southern officials have repeatedly denied providing support to the rebels. Nuland also demanded that Khartoum ""end aerial bombardments of civilian areas."" The war has already sent more than 100,000 refugees across the border into South Sudan, and the United States and United Nations have warned that hundreds more could follow, fleeing hunger and violence.","Presidents of South Sudan, Sudan to meet April 3 .

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams avenged her 2011 U.S. Open final defeat to Samantha Stosur with a straight-sets win over the Australian sixth seed to reach the last eight of the WTA tournament in Miami Monday. Williams went into the final at Flushing Meadows last year as a hot favorite to add to her tally of 13 grand titles, but was swept aside by a super-charged display from her opponent who was claiming her first. Neither has enjoyed much success since, with Stosur's form falling away and Williams sidelined by injuries. But the former world No. 1 is returning to her best at a hard-court tournament she has won five times, seeing off Stosur 7-5 6-3 in one hour 45 minutes in their last-16 match. The American converted four of 13 break-point opportunities to go 5-3 career against Stosur. The two-time Miami runner-up will next play Caroline Wozniacki, who beat Belgian 23rd seed Yanina Wickmayer 7-6 (8-6) 6-0.

The Australian Open champion trailed 6-1 4-0 against Dominika Cibulkova before defeating the Slovakian 16th seed in three sets -- their last five meetings have gone the distance, with Azarenka winning four to be 7-1 overall. ""It kinda felt like she closed her eyes and just went for everything, and me, I couldn't open my eyes. I was blinded a little bit,"" Azarenka said after winning 1-6 7-6 (9-7) 7-5. ""But my coach came to the court, kicked me a little bit that I had to at least try to change something, because it was like a snowball, and I kept rolling with the same match and wasn't adjusting. In the end I was trying to change something. But it was more about fighting in my heart today rather than any other shot."" The Belorussian will next play French seventh seed Marion Bartoli, who beat Russian No. 22 Maria Kirilenko 6-1 6-2..

"(CNN) -- With just 3,700 residents in Red Bud, Illinois, Denise Metzger is using the process of elimination to guess who bought a lottery ticket now worth $218 million at her convenience store last month. ""We're watching to figure out who hasn't been coming in,"" Metzger, manager of the Moto Mart, said Tuesday. ""If they got the ticket and are making themselves scarce, that's what we've been paying attention to."" The Mega Millions mystery winner's identity will be revealed by Illinois lottery officials at the Red Bud Village Hall by Wednesday morning. Mayor Tim Lowry sees the decision by the winner to have the announcement in his southern Illinois town as evidence it's a Red Bud resident. ""Not knowing who it is, it seems like they want to make a splash in Red Bud,"" Lowry said. It probably didn't help that the drawing happened on the eve of April Fools' weekend, leading some locals to joke on Facebook and the sidewalk that they had the winning ticket. It kicked off more than two weeks of speculation around town and online. Michigan winner charged with welfare fraud . Red Bud locals commenting on a message board thread threw out several names of suspected winners. ""Names are just going around, we just need to wait and see when they come forward. Congrats to whoever it was!"" one poster wrote. ""I really don't care who won. I really don't want to know, It wasn't me so I could care less!!!"" said another. ""I just hope it is someone that needs the money,"" another commenter said. Moto Mart, which has seen a two-fold rise in lottery ticket sales, also seems to be gossip central for lottery rumors. One rumor floating there is that someone ordered 12 new Camaros from the local Chevrolet dealership, Metzger said. ""That's a big rumor. I had a big laugh about that one."" The sales manager at Weir Chevrolet Buick GMC shot down that gossip. ""They were Corvettes,"" said Brandon Liefer. ""I'm just messing with you,"" Liefer added, clarifying that he has no clue who the new millionaire might be and they've not ordered new cars. The mayor said the ""windfall of money"" could be a boostfor his farming community's economy, but a person ""can only buy so many groceries."" The winner may find it tough to stay in a small town like Red Bud and avoid having their privacy invaded, he said. Two other winning tickets were sold for the March 30 drawing that had a record $656 million pre-tax payout. Maryland and Kansas allowed their winners to remain unnamed, but Illinois requires them to come forward publicly. The man and two women who shared ownership of the winning ticket in Maryland are public school employees who are known only as the ""Three Amigos."" The elementary school teacher, a special education teacher, and an administrative worker said they plan to keep their fortune a secret -- and keep working. Metzger and her nine employees at Moto Mart collected their own payoff for selling the winning ticket. Their company gave them $50,000 to share from the $500,000 bonus paid to the store by the Illinois Lottery.","The $218 million winner will be announced in Red Bud, Illinois, Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- The United Kingdom said Saturday it plans to send a warship to the Persian Gulf, a move that follows Western criticism of Iranian threats to close the Strait of Hormuz. The UK Ministry of Defense described the deployment of the HMS Daring as ""long-planned"" and ""entirely routine."" The destroyer will replace a frigate stationed in the area, it said. Still, in the past two weeks both U.S. and British defense officials have denounced any move by Iran to close the strait, the only outlet from the Persian Gulf and a key trade route for oil. Iran threatened in late December to block the strait if sanctions were imposed on its oil exports. France, Britain, and Germany have all proposed such sanctions to punish Iran for lack of cooperation on its nuclear program. The strait is a critical shipping lane, through which 17 million barrels of oil passed per day in 2011, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency. Analysis: Saber-rattling in Strait of Hormuz . Rear Adm. Ali Fadavi, of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, said last month the world could not last 24 hours without Persian Gulf oil, and that Iran is capable of closing the strait. ""Today, out of the 1,300 billion barrels of oil in the world, 800 billion barrels are in the Persian Gulf,"" Fadavi told Iran's Press TV. The U.S. Navy said the threat to block the strait is unacceptable, as the flow of goods and services is vital not only to the region but to the world. ""Anyone who threatens to disrupt freedom of navigation in an international strait is clearly outside the community of nations; any disruption will not be tolerated,"" Cmdr. Amy Derrick Frost, spokeswoman for the U.S. 5th Fleet based in Bahrain, said at the time. Earlier this week, Britain's secretary of state for defense, Philip Hammond, warned that any Iranian attempt to close the strait would be illegal and unsuccessful. ""Disruption to the flow of oil through Straits of Hormuz would threaten regional and global economic growth,"" Hammond said in a speech in Washington on Thursday. State media said Friday that Iran plans to conduct military drills in the strait in February under the name ""The Great Prophet."" An IRGC commander told Press TV the drills would be different from previous ones, though just how wasn't clear. Iran launched a 10-day drill in the strait in late December. Physically closing the strait would require means that likely are not available to Iran, said Professor Jean-Paul Rodrigue of Hofstra University. ""At best, Iran can posture and potentially disrupt traffic for a short duration,"" said Rodrigue, who specializes in global trade and maritime transportation issues. Frost said Navy ""maintains a robust presence in the region to deter or counter destabilizing activities,"" and works to allow commercial shipping to operate freely.","NEW: The UK plans to send a warship to the Persian Gulf .

"Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- A Norwegian court ordered Anders Behring Breivik, charged with killing 77 people last July, to undergo a month-long psychiatric evaluation as experts seek to determine his mental state ahead of a trial. Breivik is accused of killing eight people in a bomb attack in Oslo and 69 more in a gun rampage on nearby Utoya Island on July 22. It was the deadliest attack on Norwegian soil since World War II. Two court-appointed psychiatric experts recommended that Breivik should spend four weeks under 24-hour psychiatric monitoring so the court can get the fullest possible picture of his behavior, according to court documents released Friday. He should be kept away from other patients but will still have to interact with psychiatric staff, the documents say. The observation will be carried out in facilities at Ila Prison, where he is being held. Breivik has said he will not cooperate with the two psychiatric experts, which underlines the need for constant observation, the court documents said. The two experts were appointed last month to evaluate his mental state after the court requested a second opinion because of the importance of the question of his sanity to Breivik's trial. In November, prosecutors said psychiatrists had determined Breivik was paranoid and schizophrenic at the time of the attacks and during 13 interviews experts conducted with him afterward. Breivik has pleaded not guilty, though he has admitted carrying out the attacks, the judge handling his case said previously. It may not be possible for him to be sentenced to the maximum punishment for the crimes if he's deemed insane. A court ruled Monday that Breivik can legally be kept in custody until his trial starts in April. Breivik reiterated some of his extremist views during Monday's hearing, which began with him entering with a smile and offering up a raised, clenched-fist salute. Breivik says nobody could believe that he was insane, and describes questions about his mental condition as ridiculous, his lawyer, Geir Lippestad, told the court. Breivik claims the shooting rampage was a matter of self-defense, meant to save Norway from being taken over by multicultural forces and to prevent ethnic cleansing of Norwegians, Lippestad said. Authorities have described him as a right-wing Christian extremist. A 1,500-page manifesto attributed to Breivik posted on the Internet is critical of Muslim immigration and European liberalism, including Norway's Labour Party. The victims on Utoya Island were among 700 mostly young people attending a Labour Party camp on the island. Breivik's trial is scheduled to begin April 16 and is expected to last 10 weeks. Journalist Olav Mellingsaeter in Oslo contributed to this report.","Breivik will be kept under 24-hour observation by mental health experts, a court rules .

One year ago, he barely made it into his basement as a massive tornado with winds up to 200 mph picked up his home, churned it into pieces and threw it all over his Forest Lake neighborhood. ""It sucked the air out of the room, like someone trying to beat on the door violently to get in, and then 60 seconds later, it was the quietest quiet you never heard,"" he said. Limmroth emerged unscathed and watched as the mammoth storm continued its rampage through Tuscaloosa on April 27, 2011. The twister stayed on the ground for about six minutes, officials say. Fifty-three people were killed in the city that day. ""It smelled like you had been inside a lumber mill: fresh cut from the houses that were destroyed, plus the trees that were just literally cut in half,"" Limmroth said. ""It was truly eerie."" Mother-daughter team helps raise money for Tuscaloosa . The twister was part of a severe storm system that ripped through the South and Midwest that day, killing at least 327 people. It was one of the deadliest tornado outbreaks in U.S. history. Alabama was the hardest-hit state, and Tuscaloosa was the bull's-eye of the storm. More than 5,000 homes in the city alone were damaged or destroyed, and hundreds of businesses in the area were also affected, according the West Alabama Chamber of Commerce. The storm cut a six-mile-long path through the city, destroying or damaging about 12% of it, Tuscaloosa officials say. The tornado left behind enough debris to fill the University of Alabama's football stadium five times, Mayor Walt Maddox said. On Friday, members of the Tuscaloosa community came together to remember those they lost at a remembrance ceremony held at the university. Bells tolled 53 times to honor each of the city's tornado victims. The names of the dead were read aloud and pictures of them flashed on a screen -- happy glimpses into lives cut short. The Tuscaloosa tornado was later given a rating of EF4, the second-most powerful on the Enhanced Fujita Scale, meaning it had wind speeds between 166 and 200 mph. Today, a year later, a huge weed-filled lot now sits where one Tuscaloosa neighborhood used to be -- part of the huge mile-wide swath that the tornado cut through town at McFarland Boulevard and 15th Street. Right next to that lot is Evan Smith's newly rebuilt Krispy Kreme doughnut shop. ""I'm no weatherman, but I think we're standing in the dead center eye,"" Smith said. This week, plumbers finished their work on the site of his new shop. He hopes to be back in business in the next three months. ""As bad as disasters are, a lot of people benefit from them, from easier loans, lower loans and stuff like that,"" Smith said. ""But as far as me and this business, I'm not better off until I get the doors open again."" Tuscaloosa's recovery is more about rebuilding all the homes and businesses obliterated by last year's tornado, according to the city's mayor. ""It's about restoring lives,"" Maddox said. ""It's about ensuring what happened here is more meaningful than just six miles of total destruction across our city. It's about building back in such a way that people are going to have confidence that we're going to have a better tomorrow."" ""The message is this: We are coming back,"" Tuscaloosa County Probate Judge Hardy McCollum said during the Friday ceremony. Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley also spoke, vowing to stay committed to the rebuilding efforts. ""As we observe today's anniversary, let us look ahead to the work that remains to be done for the people of Alabama,"" he said. ""We've made a lot of progress in the last year. We still have a long way to go."" Today, a construction crew is putting the finishing touches on Gary Limmroth's new home, which has a poured concrete safe room. He hopes to sleep in his new place in July. ""It takes a while to figure out how do you want to build back, how do you want to do it. Do you want to come back? There were a lot of people across the lake that have decided they just can't take it. They couldn't be here, the constant reminder every day of seeing it.""","NEW: Bells toll to remember the tornado victims .

"(CNN) -- Five things learned from Sunday's GOP debate: . Everybody gets their follow-up . There's been a lot of grousing about the back-to-back debate schedule but, in fact, the candidates seemed to relish the chance to follow up on their performances Saturday night. Both Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich were panned for failing to land a blow on Mitt Romney Saturday. That changed within the opening minutes of Monday's match-up, with both candidates moving aggressively against Romney right out of the gate. Meanwhile, Jon Huntsman had clearly been thinking about Romney's Saturday criticism of his service as ambassador to China under President Barack Obama. Huntsman took the opportunity to respond Sunday. ""I was criticized last night by Gov. Romney for putting my country first,"" he said. ""I will always put my country first. I think that's important."" The one candidate clearly put to a disadvantage by the opportunity to fix Saturday night's mistakes: Romney, the longtime front-runner who skated through the first debate untouched and who is hoping to maintain the status quo days before New Hampshire voters head to the polls. Looking ahead to the general election? As in Saturday's debate, gay rights once again played a role in this one. Rick Santorum -- a man who has run on a predominantly social values platform -- offered perhaps his strongest statement of homosexual support to date, saying he would not repudiate a son who told him he was gay. He was careful, however, not to say that he would fight for gay individuals, instead saying he would be an advocate for ""every person in America"" and would make sure people are treated with ""respect and dignity."" ""That does not mean that I would agree with certain things that the gay community would like to do to change laws, with respect to marriage, with respect to adoption and things like that,"" he said. On the same topic, Mitt Romney said he has hired gay staffers in the past and would never discriminate against gays or attempt to take away their rights. Are these two men looking ahead to a general election, where strong social conservative values may not play as well on a national scale? Perhaps. Over the past few years the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) rights movement has made strides, and many question whether someone who is not pro-LGBT could win a general election in the United States in 2012. That said, social issues played a big role in Iowa, and will do so again in South Carolina. Santorum's answer may have been a good middle-of-the-road response, and a reminder of a phrase often used by Christian conservatives: love the sinner, not the sin. That may be a message to which conservative voters in the upcoming state of South Carolina can relate. Dealing with Democrats . Calls for bipartisanship at a GOP presidential debate? Could it be? Both former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney touted their records of working with Democrats to hammer out legislative deals. Gingrich, who is best know for battling President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, highlighted that he struck deals with the Democratic president, even though he wanted to make him ""a one-term president."" And Romney noted that when he was running Massachusetts, the state legislature was 85% Democratic, but that he found ""common ground,"" adding that he's proven that he can ""work with Republicans and Democrats who are willing to work together."" Rick Santorum touted his ability to gain support among voters of both parties in his former Pennsylvania district, and Huntsman said serving one's country should always trump party loyalty. But before candidates can work on uniting the party, they will have to triumph over their rivals as the bruising GOP primary plays out this winter. Huntsman's last stand? Since former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman is placing all his chips on a strong finish in New Hampshire's Tuesday primary, this weekend's two presidential debates were his last, best chance to make his case for the GOP nomination. Saturday's lukewarm performance by Huntsman, who has failed to gain much traction in the polls, was followed by a stronger delivery on Sunday morning. After coming under attack Saturday night by bitter rival Mitt Romney for his service as U.S. ambassador to China during the first two years of President Barack Obama's term, Huntsman Sunday strongly defended his time in Beijing. But he also highlighted his fiscal plans as in tune with conservative Republican principles. And in a state where independent voters could determine who wins the primary, Huntsman made his pitch, saying ""the American people are tired of the partisan division. They have had enough. And I say, we've had enough, and we have to change our direction in terms of coming together as Americans first and foremost and finding solutions to our problems."" No one taking super PAC high road . Gingrich finally had his face-off with Romney over super PAC ads that have been a negative undercurrent in the 2012 race. Both candidates ignored a question Sunday about whether they would agree to urge super PACs supporting their candidacy to take down negative advertisements. It became clear, as long as the claims in the influential ads are factually accurate, neither Gingrich nor Romney is above letting the groups do their mudslinging for them. Gingrich, the former speaker who has been the target of a majority of the negative super PAC ads, endorsed an upcoming movie-length spot about Romney and his work with venture capital firm Bain Capital. ""I agree with (Romney), it takes broad shoulders to run. If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen,"" Gingrich said. ""When the 27-and-a-half minute movie comes out, I hope it's accurate. I can say publicly I hope that the super PAC runs an accurate movie about Bain."" Gingrich also took aim at the front-runner for dishing ""pious baloney"" about his political history and reasons for launching a White House bid. ""I realize the red light doesn't mean anything to you because you're the front-runner,"" Gingrich said. ""But can we drop a little bit of the pious baloney?"" And Romney chided Gingrich for his campaign trail rhetoric. ""Mr. Speaker, I wouldn't say some of the things you've called me in public,"" Romney said. ""I think that's just over the top."" CNN's Paul Steinhauser, Shannon Travis, Shawna Shepherd, Rachel Streitfeld and Chris Welch contributed to this report.","The candidates seem to relish a chance to follow up on Saturday's debate .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's trip to Cartagena, Colombia, will be historic from the moment Air Force One touches down Friday. His weekend visit will mark the longest time a U.S. president will have spent in that country, where security concerns had limited previous presidential trips. During his visit for the sixth Summit of the Americas, the president plans to focus on the economy, trade, energy and regional security. He's also expected to highlight some of the democratic and social reforms in the region. In a speech Friday in Tampa, Florida, en route to Cartagena, Obama announced a new program that the White House is calling the Small Business Network of the Americas, which he said would help businesses get financing and counseling on how to access new markets south of the U.S. border. ""This initiative is going to help our small business. Latino-owned businesses,"" he said. ""Women-owned businesses. African-American-owned businesses."" But the agenda may be driven by other concerns that have been debated by the Latin American leaders long before they arrived for the summit. Cuba, which is not a member of the Organization of American States, is not invited to join the 34 other leaders. ""This is a point of contention,"" said Ted Piccone, a Brookings Institution senior fellow who specializes in U.S.-Latin American relations. ""There is a lot of disagreement about the U.S. policy toward Cuba. ... Cuba doesn't have a democratically elected government and therefore doesn't meet the criteria,"" he said. But that didn't stop Ecuador's leftist President Rafael Correa from stoking the fire to get Cuban leader Raul Castro a seat at the table. Correa threatened to put together a boycott with other leaders in the Bolivian Alliance (Venezuela, Bolivia and Nicaragua), which led to intense diplomacy behind the scenes. Inviting Castro would have certainly caused problems for Obama, especially in an election year. During the previous summit three years ago in Port of Spain, Trinidad, Obama had an uncomfortable encounter with Hugo Chavez, when the Venezuelan leader handed him a book critical of the United States and Europe. Colombian officials were clearly aware of the potential fallout in this case, so the country's foreign minister was dispatched to Cuba. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos himself then flew to Cuba to meet with Castro. Those meetings effectively ended the dispute, but Ecuador's Correa was angry. He fired off a letter to Santos criticizing the veto of Cuba's participation as ""intolerable."" Then he boycotted the summit, even though the other leaders who had supported his appeal confirmed they would attend. Piccone, of the Brookings Institution, said some leaders in the region are frustrated with what they view as a leftover Cold War attitude in the United States toward Cuba, and they are pushing for changes. ""My concern is that if it is fixed at the cost of abandoning the democratic rules of the group, that would too high a price to pay,"" Piccone said. The high price being paid in the drug war across Latin America is also fueling a debate. At a recent meeting at the White House with the leaders of Mexico and Canada, Obama was blunt about the ongoing threat in a region where some of the leaders believe the drug war is failing. ""Beyond our borders, these cartels and traffickers pose an extraordinary threat to our Central American neighbors,"" Obama said. One possible solution that some of those neighbors discussed is decriminalizing drugs. But on a recent trip to Mexico, a country that has been ravaged by drug-related violence, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden rejected that idea. ""There is no possibility that the Obama-Biden administration will change its policy on legalization,"" he said. While this debate won't dominate the discussions at the summit, it could make headlines. National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor told CNN, ""It's likely the issue will come up, and we welcome the discussion. However, our policy is different,"" he said. The unscripted moments are likely to be the most interesting at the summit as there is no significant agreement expected on any of the major issues. CNN's Rafael Romo contributed to this report .","President Obama is making the longest U.S. presidential visit to Colombia .

"(CNN) -- A Florida highway patrolman who ordered the opening of an interstate highway, despite dense fog and smoke from a nearby brush fire, had not received any formal training on opening or closing roads and was not aware of the agency's relevant policy or procedures, according to an investigation into the deadly January crashes that left 11 people dead. Lt. John Gourley ordered the road reopened when conditions improved on Interstate 75 because he considered it dangerous not to, he told investigators, according to a state report released Thursday. Gourley cited the potential for secondary crashes as a result of prolonged road closures based on his prior experience as a reason for the decision. Despite reservations expressed by Sgt. Bruce Simmons, who said he was worried about allowing traffic to resume too soon, Gourley proceeded with the reopening. ""I'm concerned that another cloud might roll through and then we got to go through all this again,"" said Simmons, according to the report. ""That's why we need to go ahead get DOT (the Florida Department of Transportation) to get signs and assets in place if we need to shut down where we did, we can do it,"" Gourley responded. ""Keep monitoring it but right at this point, I see no reason to keep it closed."" The report said troopers did not act with criminal intent but also ""failed to adequately communicate critical information amongst themselves regarding the fire on Paynes Prairie."" Gourley was not immediately available for comment. The report also blamed the agency for failing ""to adequately create and implement effective guidelines"" for its troopers to follow when dealing with poor visibility on roadways. And those training measures in place were considered ""ineffective and poorly memorialized,"" it said. After Gourley reopened the highway, there were not adequate resources dedicated to monitor subsequent road conditions, the report found. About 20 minutes before the fatal crashes, Trooper Steven Downing reported seeing dense smoke less than a mile east of Interstate 75, where the vehicle accidents would occur. But ""no immediate measures were taken"" to monitor the conditions in that area following his report, it added. Downing later responded to a nearby crash that involved six vehicles, which occurred near Gainesville. The National Weather Service had warned that patchy smoke and fog may have been present in the area. Lidiane Carmo, 15, was injured and lost most of her family in the I-75 pileup. The teen's case drew widespread attention after church members said she was an illegal immigrant from Brazil, and they were afraid she could face deportation. But federal officials said in February that she would be allowed to stay in the country.","A January crash on Interstate 75 in Florida left 11 people dead .

"(CNN) -- The National Weather Service has confirmed 59 tornadoes from a weekend outbreak of storms that killed six people. ""The Storm Prediction Center estimates the total will be around 75 when all surveys are complete,"" the weather service website said. There were initial reports of 135 tornadoes -- spread across Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas and Oklahoma -- from the sprawling storm system that ripped across the Plains and Midwest on Saturday. A much smaller outbreak was reported Sunday. At the time, the weather service said a final confirmed count would only come after officials had a chance to fan out across the states and determine how many of the reports were indeed tornadoes. All of the fatalities were in Woodward, Oklahoma, a community of about 12,000 people, about 85 miles west of Enid. At least 29 people were injured, officials said. The weather service said the town was hit by an EF-3 tornado, packing winds of up to 165 mph. It destroyed 89 homes and 12 businesses, according to City Manager Alan Riffel. Officials credited early warning systems elsewhere in the region with preventing more fatalities. Advisories from the system were issued two days in advance, rather than just hours, and were ""remarkably accurate,"" said Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback. ""People took it very seriously."" CNN's Rob Marciano reported from Oklahoma and Maria P. White from Atlanta.","Confirmed tornadoes are expected to be around 75 .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Your smartphone might help retailers to be smarter about your purchasing habits and even let them send you targeted discounts while you shop. Mobile marketing is an essential tool for the retailer in the next two years, said Gary Schwartz, the CEO of Impact Mobile, a mobile-tech firm. He said nearly half of all cell phones in use today are smartphones, the kind necessary for mobile marketing. In two years, that figure will jump to 70%, he said. You can register with a retailer and sign up for alerts, text messages or other notifications about special offers and sales. The retailer then can keep tabs on your shopping and spending habits and lure you into their stores. Schwartz said it's quite possible that smartphones will help boost sales and in doing so, help lift the economy. ""If they're used in a smart way, it will absolutely drive sales,"" he said. The Gap, along with its other brands Old Navy and Banana Republic, is one of the companies taking advantage of mobile marketing. ""Basically we send them offers as they shop,"" said Amy Carr, the Gap's senior director of customer relationship marketing. The Gap brands have teamed up with Visa on a smartphone app, ""Gap Mobile4U."" ""So Gap/Visa's technology allows you to see where the customers are shopping, and we can [provide] offers or discounts telling them what's going on in the store when we see that they are close to stores or inside malls shopping,"" she said. Digital marketing consultant Zachary Cohen refers to the technology that links stores directly with potential shoppers as the ""Wild West."" ""There are no rules, there are no protocols,"" said Cohen. ""The law is very fuzzy on it, because the government can't legislate things that they barely understand."" Cohen worries about smartphone spam and digital junk mail invading your most personal of personal devices. But Carr said that when it comes to this technology, the industry will most likely regulate itself. Carr said it's too dangerous for retailers to risk angering potential customers with unwanted messages that eat up texting minutes and battery life. After all, sign-up is still voluntary. Shopper David Thomason in Los Angeles said he doesn't like retailers knowing his whereabouts. ""They're privy to too much information,"" he said. ""It's invasive."" Several other shoppers outside an Old Navy store in Los Angeles also said they would not take advantage of the technology. But there are plenty of other people who have signed up for it. And according to Carr, it is working. ""We can see that this has a high take rate, so we know the customer is responding to it,"" she said. She declined to cite sales figures. The technology is still in the development phase, Carr said, but the company has models, which include unique sales codes, that it can use to measure success.","Half of all cell phones in U.S. are smartphones, needed for mobile marketing .

"Washington (CNN) -- Federal officials and the nation's 15,000 air traffic controllers announced Wednesday they are extending an existing work contract for another four years. Controllers will get the same pay raise given to other federal government employees instead of independently negotiating raises, the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Air Traffic Controllers Association said. The announcement, coming six months before the expiration of the existing contract, suggests improved relations between management and labor. It appears both sides wanted to avoid the bruising battles that characterized some previous negotiations. Under the contract extension, work rules will remain the same, the FAA said. And the controllers will get the same raises the president and Congress authorize for other federal employees. The current contract was enacted in 2009 and was to expire on October 1. But the extension, which did not require a vote of the union's members, will prolong the agreement until July 1, 2016. In a joint statement, Acting FAA Administrator Michael Huerta and National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Paul Rinaldi said the extension serves both organizations. ""This contract extension will provide stability for our work force; ensure continued collaboration to transform the air traffic system through NextGen , delivering more on-time and fuel-efficient flights; and continue to provide the safest air transportation system in the world."" NextGen is the satellite-based navigation system that currently is being phased in to replace the existing ground-based radar system. Contract negotiations between the FAA and its controllers historically have been fractious. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan fired striking controllers, leading to the decertification of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, or PATCO. And, after contract talks broke down in 2005, the union worked for more than three years under a contract imposed by President George W. Bush and Congress.","The agreement avoids the fractious negotiation process of previous contract talks .

"Washington (CNN) -- Reinforcing identity and learning more about who we are: That's the theme of ""American Stories,"" a new exhibit now open at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington. ""There are so many stories in American history,"" says museum curator Bonnie Lilienfeld. ""We tell big stories here about the foundation of this country. But we also tell individual stories."" From large swaths of America's past to the tales of everyday Americans, the exhibit features more than 100 objects tracing history from the 1620 arrival of the pilgrims in Plymouth, Massachusetts, to the 2008 presidential election. A slave ship manifest is one new Smithsonian acquisition that will be on display. ""The public hasn't even seen this yet,"" says Lilienfeld. ""We all have a sense of the fact that slaves worked in fields and as domestic workers,"" but Lilienfeld adds that there are items on display that show that people forced into slavery were also painters, sculptors and poets. Another item that dates back to America's beginnings is a suit once worn by founding father Benjamin Franklin. ""It's from the 18th century ... the fabric is very fragile,"" says Lilenfeld. Technology in our society is ever-changing. The people behind the exhibit are well aware of that, but they say it's important to note how that foundation was first laid down. A section of the first transatlantic telegraph cable is a testament to some of those early innovations. ""Innovation is a big theme in this exhibit,"" said Lilienfeld. ""One of the things we thought was really interesting was to talk about objects that everybody knows."" Evidence of that comes in the form of the first iPod ever to hit the market as well as an old Apple II computer. Entertainment also takes the spotlight. The red ruby slippers Dorothy wore as she skipped down the yellow brick road in ""The Wizard of Oz"" are on display. And the sports portion wouldn't be complete without something from ""The Greatest."" ""Muhammad Ali's gloves are here,"" said Lilienfeld. ""We all know Muhammad Ali ... float like a butterfly and sting like a bee."" You will even find Kermit the Frog seated and smiling. Museum officials realize that many visitors may be drawn to cultural touchstones like Dorothy's red ruby slippers or Ali's boxing gloves, but the hope is that visitors will also take time to learn or relearn more about America's early days. ""I think one of the main things we want visitors to walk away with is that they're part of American history,"" says Lilienfeld.","A new Smithsonian exhibit features American stories, large and small .

"(CNN) -- The long-term strategy behind America's military repositioning in Asia is gradually revealing itself. A series of moves over the past six months will set the stage for rebalancing U.S. naval, air and ground forces in the region. In November, the United States announced a permanent rotation of Marines through Australia, the stationing of up to four ships in Singapore, and expanded military exercises with the Philippines. The White House also pledged that it would protect its Asia-Pacific military forces from upcoming defense budget cuts. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda's visit to Washington this week came after an announcement about American forces in Japan. Some 9,000 Marines will be transferred from Okinawa, the prefecture that hosts the majority of U.S. forces in Japan, to three other sites: Guam, Hawaii, and -- on rotating training deployments -- Australia. The deal broke the gridlock that had been holding up a reduction of U.S. troops in Okinawa. A mutual decision not to resolve the thorny issue of a replacement facility for Marine aviation stationed at Futenma eased the way, as did the Japanese agreement to pay more than a third of the $8.6 billion cost of the move. Okinawa is part of the long Ryukyu Island chain that acts as a natural barrier between the East China Sea and the Western Pacific. U.S. forces have been stationed there since the Battle of Okinawa, the largest Pacific amphibious assault in World War II. The United States retained possession of Okinawa until 1972, by which time U.S. forces had ensconced themselves in a series of military installations. In 1995, the rape of a 12-year-old Japanese girl by three U.S. servicemen sparked a furor over the vast military presence in Okinawa. The inability to make good on a 15-year-old agreement to reduce the U.S. presence and hand back more than 20% of the land occupied by troops and to substantially reduce U.S. forces has been an open wound in an otherwise robust alliance with Japan. The new deal should soothe but not solve local tensions. U.S. forces demonstrated their value in responding to last year's massive earthquake and tsunami, and they remain ready to deal with a range of potential near-term threats. But the transfer of Marines from Okinawa is the latest element giving definition to a long-term strategy to preserve regional order and U.S. influence throughout Asia. These gradual changes are happening amid a variety of key debates: within the United States, about the necessity and affordability of a strong presence in Asia; within China about whether America's ""return to Asia"" is aimed at containing growing Chinese power; and within the region over the durability of America's commitment to underwriting order in the Asia-Pacific region. There are good reasons for retaining but dispersing U.S. military forces throughout the region. First, the Asia-Pacific region is of growing global importance economically and politically, a long-term trend that has made it a rising priority for U.S. administrations since the end of the Cold War. There is indeed a desire to preserve a favorable balance of military power so as to deter and accommodate a re-emerging China; yet the retention of U.S. forces in the region is not designed to curb Chinese growth. U.S. and Japanese leaders label this as dealing with ""uncertainty."" It hedges against a variety of contingencies, from conflict with North Korea to natural disasters, while also reassuring allies, engaging a larger number of regional partners, and allowing the United States to be a force for stability within an evolving regional order. Second, these changes emerge from a longstanding need for better management of the U.S.-Japan alliance. To reduce the political if not the financial costs of stationing forces in Japan, the United States must lighten the burden on local populations, especially in Okinawa. A closer integration of U.S. and Japanese forces is likewise under way. China portrays the U.S.-Japan alliance as a Cold War relic incompatible with expanding cooperation with China; but most regional neighbors see it as a reassuring bellwether of stability. Third, the U.S. rebalancing redistributes forces from a few, fixed bases that are increasingly vulnerable to such emerging potential threats as China's missile, cyber and space capabilities, and maritime and air forces. Retaining the III Marine Expeditionary Force headquarters and some forces in Okinawa, the United States is shifting two Marine Air-Ground Task Forces (each comprising about 2,500 troops) to an emerging strategic hub in Guam, rotating another through Darwin, Australia, and basing supporting elements in Hawaii. These forces are more resilient because they are more difficult to target, yet well poised to maneuver together in the event of a crisis. In short, the shifting of U.S. forces in the Asia-Pacific region is designed to deter conflict, respond to contingencies, reassure allies and partners, and shape an evolving regional order, including cooperation on humanitarian assistance and disaster response. Japan, once called an ""unsinkable aircraft carrier,"" remains critical to U.S. basing strategy in the Asia-Pacific. Some 30,000 U.S. forces will remain based in Japan, about the same number as in Korea. The number is higher if you count U.S. forces afloat. But as prosperous Japan and South Korea assume more responsibilities for their defense, the United States has a strategic, fiscal, and operational need to redistribute its assets. The growing importance of islands, from Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands to Hawaii and other islands that will be used for prepositioning and training, helps build flexibility in the American Pacific strategy. Various Obama administration officials place an emphasis on America as a ""resident power"" of the region rather than a foreign presence. But many in the region welcome U.S. military presence precisely because it hails from a distant great power capable of underwriting peace in a region riven by historical conflicts, territorial disputes, resource competition, and disparate values. The emerging U.S. basing strategy is designed to build on America's long-standing presence while ensuring that its stabilizing power remains welcome for decades to come.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Osama bin Laden spent years on the run in Pakistan after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, moving from one safe house to another and fathering four children, at least one of whom was born in a government hospital, his youngest widow has told Pakistani investigators. A deposition taken from the widow, identified by police as Amal Ahmed Abdul Fateh, gives the clearest picture yet of bin Laden's life while international forces hunted him. ""While we may never be able to corroborate every detail, generally speaking, bin Laden's wife's account seems plausible, and it confirms some previously held theories on where the al-Qaeda leader was hiding over the years,"" a U.S. official said about the widow's account. The world's most wanted man remained free until U.S. Navy SEALs killed him during a raid on his compound in Abbottabad in May 2011. Fateh and two other widows of bin Laden's -- identified by U.S. officials as Khairiah Sabar and Siham Sabar -- have been in Pakistani custody since the raid. Pakistani authorities have started legal proceedings against the widows, alleging forgery and illegal entrance into Pakistan. A source familiar with the widows' case told CNN the three women will be charged Monday with living illegally in Pakistan. If convicted, they could face a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. The source said the Yemeni government has expressed readiness to let Fateh return home. Saudi Arabia, where the other two women are from, has been more resistant. In the January 19 police report, first published by the Pakistani newspaper Dawn and obtained Friday by CNN, Fateh said she had always wanted to marry a mujahed, or holy warrior. When word of plans for her arranged marriage to bin Laden came in 2000, she flew to Pakistan, crossed the Afghanistan border at Quetta and went to Kandahar. She said she did not recall exactly when, but she was married before the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. She lived with bin Laden and his two other wives until the attacks. The family ""scattered"" after that, she told police. She said she returned to the southern port city of Karachi with her eldest daughter, Safia, and stayed in a flat for eight or nine months. She said that ""all the things were arranged by some Pakistani family and Saad,"" bin Laden's eldest son. They moved six or seven times in Karachi before she reunited with bin Laden in the border city of Peshawar. They moved to the Swat Valley, living in two houses over an eight- or nine-month period. Next, they shifted to Haripur, also in northern Pakistan. Fateh's daughter Aasia was born there in 2003 and son Ibrahim the next year. Fateh said she stayed in a hospital on both occasions. They settled in Abbottabad in 2005 and stayed there for six years before bin Laden was killed. Fateh had two more children in Abbottabad -- daughter Zainab was born in 2006 and son Hussain in 2008. Fateh said two families, whom she called the Ibrahim and Abrar families, stayed with them while they were in Swat, Haripur and Abbottabad, and ""everything was arranged by them."" She said some members of those two families were killed in the raid, as was bin Laden's 20-year-old son, Khalid. She told police she never applied for a visa during her stay in Pakistan. CNN asked Pakistani officials in Washington, in e-mails and over the phone, whether they had any knowledge of Fateh's movements and got no response. CNN's Brian Todd, Peter Bergen and Tim Lister contributed to this report.","Osama bin Laden's family ""scattered"" after the 9/11 attacks, widow tells police .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- The Tibetan government-in-exile has called on the international community to take action to halt violence in western China that has reportedly killed several Tibetans and left others wounded. ""The Central Tibetan Administration urges the international community to not remain passive before the current situation,"" Lobsang Sangay, the head of the government-in-exile, said in a statement Tuesday. ""It is high time for it to intervene to prevent further bloodshed."" Clashes between Tibetan protesters and Chinese authorities occurred in recent days in Ganzi Prefecture, a mountainous area west of Sichuan Province. The unrest comes after a string of self-immolations by Tibetan protesters in recent months and with the approach of the anniversary of an uprising against Chinese rule, which has been a flash point in the past. The United States, which recognizes Tibet as an autonomous region of China, expressed concern about the situation. ""We are seriously concerned by reports of violence continuing, heightened tensions in the Tibetan area of China, including reports that security forces in Sichuan Province have been opening fire on protesters, killing some and injuring others,"" Victoria Nuland, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, said Tuesday. The Chinese government and international groups advocating Tibetan rights have offered differing versions of events this week in Ganzi, which Tibetans call Kardze. China has accused the rights groups of trying to ""distort the truth"" about the violence through ""ill-intentioned hype."" The first clashes took place Monday in Luhuo County, known as Drango by Tibetans. Citing witnesses, rights groups like Free Tibet and the International Campaign for Tibet say that thousands of Tibetans had marched on government offices before the police opened fire into the unarmed crowd, killing two or three protesters and injuring dozens. The reports, which could not be independently verified, contrasted with the account given by the Chinese state news agency. A group of people, some with knives, damaged stores along a main street before throwing stones at the police and destroying two police vehicles and two ambulances, according to Xinhua news agency. The violence left one of the marchers dead and four wounded, as well as five police officers wounded, according to the news agency. It did not mention the use of guns by the authorities. Then on Tuesday, violence reportedly erupted in Seda County, which Tibetans call Serthar. Tibetan advocacy groups said that the Chinese security forces had shot dead between two and five protesters. There was no immediate reaction from the Chinese authorities on the reports of violence in Seda. ""How long and how many tragic deaths are necessary before the world takes a firm moral stand?"" said Sangay, who took over from the Dalai Lama last year as the political head of the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamsala, India. ""Silence from the world community sends a clear message to China that its repressive and violent measures to handle tensions in Tibetan areas are acceptable."" The United States said it was keeping the pressure on China over the issue. The violence comes ahead of the Tibetan New Year on February 22 amid high tensions following more than a dozen self-immolations by Tibetans in the past year. For a fifth straight year, China will close Tibet to foreign tourists again this year from the Tibetan New Year festival until the anniversary of a deadly anti-government riot among Tibetans in March, according to regional travel agents.

"London (CNN) -- Wearing a pink dress and red cardigan, her long hair in pigtails, 5-year-old Thusha Kamaleswaran skips and twirls in the aisle of her uncle's small London store. These are the last dance steps she will take. Surveillance video from the store, used in the conviction of three men Monday, shows Thusha swept up by panicked people and moments later lying on the shop floor, unable to get up. She was knocked down by a bullet to the chest fired through the store's open door by three men as they pursued members of a rival gang. The gunshot has left Thusha, now 6, paralyzed and still under hospital care a year later. The little girl's heart stopped twice in the night after she was shot, and she was only saved by emergency surgery in the store and later at a hospital, London's Metropolitan Police said. Her pretty face smiles shyly from the covers of several national newspapers Tuesday, her story one that has touched the nation. ""Gunned down as she danced"" and ""Senseless"" read headlines in The Sun and the Daily Mirror. Thusha is not the only innocent bystander to bear the scars of what police say was crossfire from a south London gang feud. Fragments of bullet remain inside 35-year-old Roshan Selvakumar's head after he was hit in the face as he shopped for groceries. The fragments cannot safely be removed, police say. The three men convicted, Anthony McCalla, Kazeem Kolawole and Nathaniel Grant, were tracked down after detectives viewed more than 700 hours of closed-circuit footage seized from more than 150 cameras, the police said. One grainy video clip shows McCalla mimicking a ride-by shooting as he cycles down a street minutes before the attack. Another reveals Kolawole dumping the gray top he wore on the night of the shooting in a trash can. All three were found guilty Monday on charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and attempted murder in the shooting in March 2011. They are due to be sentenced at the Old Bailey court in London on April 19. Thusha's parents, who agreed that the heartbreaking footage of their daughter's final moments of carefree dance should be released for the first time Monday, paid tribute to the emergency workers who saved her life. ""We are very happy justice has been done,"" they said. Detective Superintendent Gordon Allison said both Thusha -- whom he described as just ""a baby"" -- and Selvakumar were ""innocent victims caught up in McCalla, Grant and Kolawole's intent on committing violence that night."" All three had chosen to take part in gang crime, he said, adding: ""The shooting caused widespread shock and disbelief but they have never shown any remorse for their actions."" At the start of this year, changes were made to the way the Metropolitan Police tackles gang crime, he said, and there have been 500 arrests since February. The issue of gang violence gained national prominence when London and other cities were shaken by several days of rioting last summer. In London, 19% of those arrested were reported to be affiliated with a gang, according to a Home Office study published in October. CNN's Bharati Naik contributed to this report.","5-year-old girl was left permanently paralyzed by the shooting .

"(CNN) -- Train commuters in major cities worldwide will get a little cheeky Sunday as part of the annual No Pants Subway Ride that ... well ... is exactly what it says. Pranksters will converge at train stations decked out in shirts, shoes and no pants. The only requirement is to act nonchalant -- read, listen to your iPod, chat with your fellow riders -- as you go about your normal business without any pants. After the rides, participants will flood to pre-determined bars for cocktails and chatter. And no. No pants there, either. Dozens of major cities including London, New York, Washington, Mexico City and Tel Aviv, will take part in the rides, according to organizers Improv Everywhere. Improv Everywhere started the No Pants Subway Ride in New York 10 years ago, according to its website. The New York City-based group boasts of causing ""scenes of chaos and joy"" usually involving socially awkward or unusual situations. Its goal is to elicit laughs, and it has no political agenda. Other popular pranks have included sending hundreds of participants to a beach wearing black tuxedos and evening gowns, and flooding a Best Buy store with members dressed exactly like the staff.","NEW: The goal is to elicit laughs; the group has no political agenda .

"(CNN) -- An American cruise line has said it ""deeply regrets"" the deaths of two Panamanian fishermen amid claims that one of its cruise ships failed to help their stranded boat. Princess Cruises said passengers on the Star Princess apparently alerted a crew member to the disabled fishing boat in March, but initial indications are that the captain was never told. Later that month, the Ecuadorian navy rescued the only survivor of what was meant to be an overnight fishing trip, 18-year-old Adrian Vasquez, after 28 days adrift. Since then, pressure has grown on the cruise line from local and international media to explain why it failed to help. Broadcaster NPR first reported the claim by three passengers, all bird-watchers, that they had spotted the castaways and told cruise ship staff but had seen no action taken. A reporter with the Panama-Guide.com website confirmed with Vasquez that he and his two friends, who at that point were still alive, had tried to attract the attention of the passing cruise ship. Princess Cruises ""deeply regrets that two Panamanian men perished at sea,"" its statement Thursday said. ""The preliminary results of our investigation have shown that there appeared to be a breakdown in communication in relaying the passenger's concern. Neither Captain Edward Perrin nor the officer of the watch were notified,"" it said. ""Understandably, Captain Perrin is devastated that he is being accused of knowingly turning his back on people in distress."" If Perrin had received the information, he would have been able to respond appropriately, the company said. ""We all understand that it is our responsibility and also the law of the sea to provide assistance to any vessel in distress, and it is not an uncommon occurrence for our ships to be involved in a rescue at sea,"" it said. Its ships have been involved in more than 30 rescues in the past decade, Princess Cruises added. The story of Vasquez's miraculous survival gained international coverage when he was picked up north of the GalÃ¡pagos Islands. The alert was first raised by Vasquez's parents after he and his two friends, Oropeces Betancourt, 24, and Fernando Osorio, 16, failed to return as expected to the town of Rio Hato, Panama. Local fishermen and then the Panamanian navy joined the search, sending ships and airplanes to look for the trio, to no avail. For nearly a month, their fate remained a mystery. But on March 21, fishermen spotted the boat, named the Fifty Cents, adrift nearly 600 miles from where it had launched. After being alerted by the fishermen, the Ecuadorian navy rescued Vazquez. Rear Adm. Freddy Garcia Calle said Vasquez showed ""severe signs of dehydration and lack of nutrition"" when he was found. He said the survivor had thrown his friends' bodies into the ocean ""because they had become badly decomposed."" Vasquez's mother, Nilsa de la Cruz, told CNN last month that she was overjoyed to have her son back. ""After 28 days of anguish, after praying to God that he be found alive ... this is indeed a miracle,"" de la Cruz said. She said her son told her the February 24 fishing trip had started out well. The three caught plenty of fish. But the boat's engine died without warning and, with no tools and scant navigational experience, there was little the trio could do, de la Cruz told CNN. Soon, currents had swept their boat out into the Pacific, far from the coast. De la Cruz said the three ate raw fish and drank rainwater. They had already been adrift for two weeks when passengers on the Star Princess apparently spotted their tiny boat as the fishermen waved for help. CNN's Rafael Romo contributed to this report.","Princess Cruises is investigating what happened after passengers raised the alert .

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- A plane carrying Madagascar's ousted leader Marc Ravalomanana was turned away from Madagascan airspace Saturday as he tried to return from exile, his spokesman and the airline said. Ravalomanana, who had been in South Africa in exile, took off from Johannesburg Saturday morning in what was his second bid to return to his home country. But Ravalomanana's spokesman Patrick Gearing, in South Africa, told CNN that the civil aviation authorities on the Indian Ocean island had closed the airspace, refusing the plane permission to land. By Saturday afternoon the plane -- and Ravalomanana -- were back in South Africa, said Gearing. Ravalomanana was ousted in March 2009 through a coup backed by the military, which handed power to current President Andry Rajoelina, the youthful former mayor of Antananarivo. Shortly before boarding his flight to the capital, Antananarivo, Ravalomanana said that he had just spoken with the Madagascan Prime Minister Omer Beriziky, who told him ""everything was OK."" Speaking before the flight took off, Gearing said: ""He has no control over what will happen to him when he arrives but he is prepared to face whatever comes his way."" Ravalomanana's previous unsuccessful effort to return last year came to an end in Johannesburg, when the airline he was using was told it wouldn't be allowed to land if he was on board. Madagascar is in the process of implementing a peace agreement facilitated by a regional body, the South African Development Community. Gearing says Ravalomanana met with South Africa's President Jacob Zuma Friday to thank him for letting him stay following his ouster. U.S. and South African diplomatic sources tell CNN his return would be catastrophic for any peace process going forward. CNN's Pierre Meilhan contributed to this report.","NEW: Marc Ravalomanana's plane has arrived in South Africa after being turned away .

"(CNN) -- John Cossman's friends call him cancer's iron man. He's had more than 90 radiation treatments and 200 chemo treatments since being diagnosed with head and neck cancer eight years ago. The cancer has spread to his right lung, his right arm and his brain. Four years ago, he ran out of treatment options -- every available form of chemo had been used. If he wanted to live, he'd have to enter clinical trials. ""How long do I have here?"" he asked his doctor. ""With treatment, two years,"" the doctor responded. ""Without treatment, six months."" Now, Cossman, 61, is sitting in a doctor's office, ready to undergo a CT scan that will determine if his cancer is being kept in check. He's on his fourth clinical trial. Three times, he's heard bad news. He tries not to think about that as he slides into the giant machine that envelopes his body. He thinks instead of his wife and 13-year-old daughter, adopted from China. Life offers too much to give in. ""I will know when there's not a whole helluva lot of time left. And I don't feel that way right now. ... If what I'm doing can help somebody down the line, then it's worthwhile."" Holding disease at bay . Cossman is one of 16 patients with progressive forms of cancer currently taking part in a study of a developmental drug by the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Cerulean Pharma. The company hopes to add another 20 patients to the trial in laboratories in Arizona, California and New Mexico. The test drug is in the second phase of a three-phase process that takes years before the Food and Drug Administration even considers whether to bring the drug to market. Cossman is one of the tens of thousands of people worldwide enrolled in drug trials. According to ClinicalTrials.gov, there are more than 96,500 trials under way in 174 countries. Cossman learned of drug trials through his oncologist --""otherwise, I'd know nothing about them."" He wants to make others ""aware of head and neck cancer, and that clinical trials are available,"" he says. ""People need to be aware, though, that they are rolling the dice."" In this case, the chemotherapy drug, known as CRLX101, is placed inside nanoparticles -- tiny particles just slightly bigger than molecules -- that are delivered intravenously every two weeks to patients. The hope is that the nanoparticles target the cancer and release chemotherapy inside the tumors while shielding healthy tissue from the toxicity of chemo, says Oliver Fetzer, the president and CEO of Cerulean. By doing that, the drug homes in on the tumors and, at the same time, patients can maintain a decent quality of life. ""You want to see how long you can actually hold the disease at bay,"" Fetzer says. Adds John Ryan, Cerulean's chief medical officer: ""The true measure of success in oncology is extending the length of time someone stays alive."" Yet this drug is far from market. The FDA can put a stop to a clinical trial at any moment if unexpected safety issues arise. ""We keep in touch with the FDA constantly throughout the clinical trial,"" Ryan says. ""There's a constant interchange with the FDA, particularly with respect to the safety of the drug and anything unexpected."" It takes about nine years for an oncology drug to go through the necessary clinical studies to FDA approval, said Dr. Kenneth Kaitin, director of The Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, an independent nonprofit research group. According to a 2007 study by the center, a drug company spends about $1.3 billion per approved product, a figure that includes costs of failed test drugs. When the test drug is for cancer, the patients have very aggressive forms. Success is often measured in small steps. ""What you're normally looking at in this patient population, if you can keep it at bay for two months, you are actually doing quite well, because the patients are so far along"" with cancer, says Fetzer. ""It's a rule of thumb at best, because every disease is different, every patient is different."" 'I went through every type of chemo' It started with a lump in his throat eight years ago. Cossman thought it would go away. His doctor diagnosed it as head and neck cancer -- a surprise to Cossman because he's never been a heavy drinker or smoker. He underwent 36 radiation and chemo treatments over 2½ months. He survived on a feeding tube for six months. The next three years would be cancer free. But in June 2005, a tumor popped up in his right lower lung. Chemo and radiation began again. The tumor was eliminated, yet a spot showed up again about a year later. ""You get to a point where they can't radiate the lung any more."" He still has breathing problems from the radiation to his lung. One chemo treatment clogged up his tear ducts. Another created a rash all over his body. ""By June 2006,"" he says, ""I went through every type of chemo that's been approved for head and neck cancer. The chemo would either stop working or the side effects would be more detrimental to my health."" His option: Die or enter clinical trials. The first study kept his tumors -- by that time he had four -- in check for about five months. To remain in a trial, tumor growth has to be limited to 20 percent. A scan showed 22 percent growth. ""You can't immediately go from one study to another. You have to be washed out for 30 days of chemicals and radiation."" In his second study, he developed a tumor on his right arm. He soon was having vision problems and started losing his hair. The man who had already endured so much was diagnosed with a brain tumor. In December, he underwent surgery to remove it. His third study earlier this year did not work. ""You hold your breath, hoping that it's working. Then, when the CT scan comes back and it shows the tumors are growing, it's really frustrating."" ""Do I get depressed? Yes. But do I want to give up? No,"" he says. So Cossman entered his fourth study this summer, the trial by Cerulean Pharma. Fighting on . Dressed in a medical gown, Cossman awaits the CT scan. He's gently glided into the large tube. The tests take just a few minutes. He doesn't look for sympathy. He has no complaints about what he's been dealt. In fact, he celebrates life because ""it's been good to me."" His little girl was 5 when he was diagnosed. She's now 13. He says far too few cancer patients who could be eligible for trials are aware of them. He wants others who are suffering to be more proactive -- to ask their doctors about all their options. Slowly, he emerges from his CT scan. The waiting for results begins. He heads home. He tries not to get his hopes up. His phone rings after a few hours.  On the other end of the line, his doctor delivers the best news he's had in more than a year. His cancer has grown at a rate of 11 percent, enough to remain on the study. Yet the good news is only temporary. A few weeks later, blood shows up in Cossman's bladder and a new tumor is found on his back. His doctor advises getting him off the study. Cossman hopes to enter a new one soon. ""You're always on a roller-coaster when you have cancer. You have some successes and a lot of failures."" Does he still have the fight to live? ""Definitely,"" he says. CNN's Jarrett Bellini contributed to this report.","John Cossman has been battling cancer for eight years .

"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Sri Lanka's National Olympic Committee has finalized the list of its athletes who will represent the nation at the forthcoming Olympic Games to be held at the Chinese capital, Beijing, this year. Thilini Jayasinghe, shown here in 2006, will compete in badminton for Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan team of three men and four women includes athletic sensation Susanthika Jayasinghe; javelin thrower Nadeeka Lakmali; badminton player Thilini Jayasinghe; shooter E.M. Senanayake; and boxer Anuruddha Ratnayake. In addition, the NOC has included Mayumi Raheem and Daniel Lee for the swimming events. This time, too, Sri Lanka is pinning hopes on veteran athlete Susanthika Jayasinghe, who will be competing at the Olympics in the women's 100-meter and 200-meter events. Although she stands at No. 31 in the IAAF rankings list for the 100-meter sprint, it does not exhibit her true potential. Her best performance in the 100-meter this year was 11.24 seconds, recorded at the Doha-Qatar Super Grand Prix last month. Susanthika's pet event is the women's 200 meters, for which she won the bronze at the Sydney Olympics, eight years ago. According to the IAAF rankings, she stands at No. 8 in the 200-meter rankings. Her best time in 200 meters for this year is 22.73 seconds, recorded at the Carson Adidas Track Classic last month. The other person to watch is boxer Anuruddha Ratnayake. The flyweight boxer is the first Sri Lankan boxer to be featured in the Olympics in 40 years. Sri Lanka was last represented in boxing at the Mexico City games held in 1968. The Sri Lankan media has already begun a huge ""Go for Gold"" campaign to motivate Ratnayake to bring Sri Lanka its first Olympic medal in boxing in its 60 years of connection with the world's greatest sports show. Another Sri Lankan is making history at this year's Olympics; Thilini Jayasinghe, who becomes the first Sri Lankan women's badminton player ever to represent Sri Lanka at the Olympics. The Sri Lankan public, as well as the athletes, appear not to be happy with the way authorities have committed the necessary support for the athletes in preparation for the Olympics. However, many are of the belief that either Susanthika or Anuruddha will bring honor to their motherland at the Beijing Olympics.","Seven athletes will compete for Sri Lanka at the Beijing Olympics .

"(CNN) -- Mohammed Merah had plenty of stamps in his passport, according to French intelligence officials. He traveled through at least seven Middle Eastern and central Asian countries on his way to Afghanistan in 2010. It was a meandering journey that might have been a metaphor for a young man in search of a purpose and identity. But it's also clear that by then he had been exposed to a variety of jihadist influences. The 23-year-old Frenchman was shot dead last Thursday after being cornered by police in Toulouse. By then he had murdered seven people in a series of gun attacks. As more details emerge about his short and troubled life, French security services are examining family and local influences on Merah, as well as trying to establish who he may have met during that trip to Afghanistan and another two-month visit to Pakistan in 2011. Merah certainly never made any attempt to disguise his travels. While in Pakistan in October of last year, he even contacted a French intelligence official who wanted to interview him about his previous journey, saying he was there to look for a wife. ""As soon as I get back, I will contact you,"" he told his contact, according to Bernard Squarcini, the head of DRCI -- France's domestic security service. After being hospitalized with hepatitis upon his return, Merah eventually sat down with French investigators, bringing a USB drive with photographs of what he said was his touristic journey across the regon. But as the standoff unfolded in Toulouse last week, Merah told a very different story -- boasting to French police that he had been trained by al Qaeda in Waziristan, the tribal area of Pakistan where many European jihadists have gone. Merah said he had been trained by a solo instructor rather than in a camp because he would have stood out as a French speaker. But he also said there were other French militants in Waziristan, according to Squarcini. He also claimed that ""brothers in Pakistan"" had supplied him with funds, helping him buy what he said were 20,000 euros (about $26,600) worth of weapons for his attacks. French police believe it is more likely he raised the funds through a series of temporary jobs and petty crime. But who, if anyone, trained Merah? Was his rambling confession during the siege the invention of a young man with what his attorney calls signs of a ""dual personality?"" Or did his skill as a gunman suggest training somewhere? ""He's a Janus, two-faced. You have to go back to his broken childhood and psychiatric troubles. To carry out what he did smacks more of a medical problem and fantasy than a simple jihadist trajectory,"" Squarcini told the newspaper, Le Monde. The Long Way to Kandahar . Merah's 2010 odyssey included Cairo, where his brother Abdelkader then lived, as well as Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and even Israel, where according to French officials he was briefly detained and relieved of a knife by police. Israeli officials have not confirmed he was there. French officials say Merah entered Afghanistan in the fall of 2010 through its northern border with Tajikistan, and traveled south to the Taliban heartland in Kandahar. That's when he first appeared on French security services' radar, according to Squarcini, who told Le Monde that Merah was detained at a roadblock while traveling with a group of Afghans in November 2010. He was transferred to American custody and put on a plane back to Kabul, returning to France on December 5, 2010. French officials have not publicly disclosed any evidence that Merah developed ties to al Qaeda or other terrorist outfits during his two trips. Nor has any ""proof of mission"" video yet surfaced featuring Merah, though such releases have sometimes taken many months. However, Richard Barrett, the coordinator of the U.N. Sanctions Committee on al Qaeda and the Taliban, told CNN there were indications that Merah appeared to have had contacts with militants in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region. And Le Monde cited security sources as saying that he may have been in touch with the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. Is it possible that in just a few weeks in Pakistan Merah could have become a trained jihadist? There are precedents. Adis Medunjanin, an American citizen of Bosnian descent who goes on trial next month for an al Qaeda bomb plot against New York in 2009, spent only one month in Pakistan. According to his alleged co-conspirators Najibullah Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay, the trio connected with al Qaeda and were trained and directed to launch a plot against the United States. Zazi and Ahmedzay have pleaded guilty to the plot. A document found on an alleged Austrian al Qaeda operative in Berlin last year, which German authorities believe was written by a senior al Qaeda figure, recommended that foreign fighters should be trained quickly and sent back to their home countries to enhance the group's ability to target the West regularly, according to Yassin Musharbash, a reporter with Germany's Die Zeit newspaper. A family with jihadist connections . Merah's path to radicalism remains murky but appears to have been influenced by family connections. His mother is married to Sabri Essid, a member of a Toulouse network that tried to recruit fighters to join al Qaeda in Iraq. Essid was convicted in a French court in 2009 after being detained in Syria in 2006 where he was running an al Qaeda safe house. According to French security officials, Merah tried to visit his stepfather in prison in 2008 and sent him money. His brother Abdelkader was also suspected of involvement in the same network but not charged. He has now been charged with complicity in the recent spate of murders. A senior Belgian counterterrorism official has told CNN that Abdelkader Merah first came to their notice during a joint investigation in 2008 with French police into a Brussels, Belgium-based jihadist recruitment network. The network was sending Belgian and French militants to Cairo en route to join militants in Iraq -- and may also have connected Europeans to jihadist groups in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region. While living in Cairo, Abdelkader Merah was associated with militants, said the official, but the investigation did not result in charges against him. Investigators are now looking more closely at the time Mohammed Merah spent with his brother in Egypt. It is also possible that Mohammed Merah became radicalized while serving a 21-month prison sentence for theft in France. He told police during the standoff that he had learned the Quran while in jail. At some point, Merah appears to have developed connections with Forsane Alizza, a pro-al Qaeda group in France with a cluster of followers in Toulouse. The group was outlawed in January 2012 for encouraging French citizens to travel to Afghanistan to fight jihad. According to an analysis by the International Centre for the Study of Radicalization, the group has between 30 and 100 full-fledged members and several thousand online followers. Following the ban, its leader Mohamed Achamlane warned ""armed struggle is possible"" should French society become more hostile to Islam. A central Asian connection? The only -- unlikely -- claim of responsibility for Merah's gun attacks so far has come from a recently-formed central Asian terror group -- Jund al Khilafah (JaK). ""One of the knights of Islam, our brother Yusuf al-Firansi (the Frenchman), we ask Allah to accept him, went out in an operation that shook the foundations of Zio-Crusaderdom,"" according to an online posting from the group translation by the SITE Intelligence Group. Some counterterrorism officials are skeptical of the claim. ""It seems highly opportunistic,"" said Barrett, the coordinator of the U.N. Sanctions Committee on al Qaeda and the Taliban. Jacob Zenn, a Jamestown Foundation analyst who has researched JaK, told CNN the group has a track record of quickly and credibly claiming responsibility for attacks in Kazakhstan since its founding in September 2011. ""JaK has a history of making very relevant and current statements,"" typically within 48 hours, Zenn told CNN. The group, he said, had accurately provided information about attacks, before that information became publicly available. While the group is believed responsible for several attacks against security forces in 2011 including the country's first suicide bombing and gun and grenade attacks, it has yet to launch an attack in Kazakhstan this year. Zenn said JaK's apparent claim of responsibility posted Thursday was in similar form to others posted by the group. But he cautioned that an attack in France would be a completely new territory for the group, which had no known track record of attracting Western operatives. Last fall JaK claimed responsibility for several attacks across Kazakhstan, including a failed bombing in October in Atyrau -- an oil town near the banks of the Caspian Sea. Zenn believes it is possible that a crackdown by security services in Kazakhstan has driven more of its members to the relative safe haven of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region. He says it's possible that Merah encountered jihadists on his journey through central Asia. However, JaK was not publicly known when Merah was in the region. The JaK footprint in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region is likely small, Zenn said. ""There are reports of no more than 30 of their members being in FATA (the tribal territories of Pakistan) and it's possible they've become integrated with a larger group like the IMU (the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan),"" he told CNN. The IMU, although not directly responsible for terrorist plots against the West, appears to have forged close ties with al Qaeda and the Pakistan Taliban in recent years, according to Western counterterrorism officials. A significant number of German militants have joined its ranks, including several implicated in an al Qaeda plot to attack Europe in late 2010. As far as is known, Merah made no reference to any central Asian group during his standoff with authorities.","French authorities are probing Mohammed Merah's background .

"Syria/ United Nations (CNN) -- As diplomats at the United Nations slammed Syria, violence continued to rage on the ground and residents wondered out loud what the implications of total war might be. ""Everyone we've been talking to ... believes that the country is heading towards, or already is in, a full-blown war, and recovering from that is going to be incredibly challenging,"" said CNN's Arwa Damon, who reported from inside Syria early Tuesday. She spoke from an opposition safe house, describing a near constant flow of people and information. CNN is not disclosing her exact location because of concerns for her safety. ""What a lot of people are realizing and accepting at this stage is that this is going to be bloody battle -- that more lives are going to be lost,"" said Damon. She reported from Syria one day after the U.N. high commissioner for human rights said she is outraged by the country's ""ongoing onslaught"" on its citizens. Navi Pillay spoke before the U.N. General Assembly, which could issue a formal condemnation of the Syrian regime. Her harsh comments prompted an angry defense from Syria's ambassador, who complained of an ""unprecedented"" media and political campaign to incite the opposition in his country. As they spoke, some Syrian towns and cities came under fresh attack with soldiers going door to door rounding up civilians, rolling their tanks through towns, or continuing their shelling of neighborhoods, according to activists and residents. More than 680 people died last week in Syria, most of whom were killed in Homs, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists. On Monday, 30 civilians -- including two children -- were killed in violence, the LCC said. Most were in the areas of Homs and Idlib. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported a funeral was held for 19 soldiers and officers killed by terrorists throughout the country. CNN cannot independently confirm details of the events in Syria because the government has severely limited the access of international journalists. ""The nature and scale of abuses committed by Syrian forces indicates that crimes against humanity are likely to have been committed since March 2011,"" Pillay said, referring to the start of the popular uprising against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which prompted his government to crack down on protesters. ""Independent, credible, and corroborated accounts indicate that these abuses have taken place as part of a widespread and systematic attack on civilians. ""Furthermore, the breadth and patterns of attacks by military and security forces on civilians and the widespread destruction of homes, hospitals, schools, and other civilian infrastructure indicate approval or complicity by the authorities at the highest levels,"" Pillay said. By end of the day Monday, a General Assembly draft resolution that would condemn Syrian human rights violations had not been formally introduced. It was unclear when it would be, also when there might be a vote. The vote would be nonbinding but would be the strongest U.N. statement yet on the violence. Russia and China vetoed a previous attempt by the U.N. Security Council to condemn Syria for the crackdown. ""The people of Syria justifiably feel that the United Nations has shamefully abandoned their cause. We must, as individual member states and collectively, send them a clear signal that this is not the case,"" British Ambassador to the U.N. Mark Lyall Grant told diplomats. Syria's U.N. ambassador, Bashar Jaafari, said the ""aggressive, illegitimate"" criticism of his country is designed to undermine the government. An Arab League proposal over the weekend for a joint U.N.-Arab peacekeeping force in the country is an ""incitement to terrorism,"" he said, because it would provide support to opposition fighters. Jaafari also said the proposal seeks to trample on Syria's sovereignty. ""We in Syria could not imagine sending soldiers to defend Occupy Wall Street protesters. Neither we or any other government can imagine sending forces to protect demonstrators in London or Paris,"" he said. ""The state has exclusive responsibility for defending security on its national territory."" Russian officials said Monday they were studying the Arab League proposal, but they indicated reluctance to sign on, saying the permission of the host country is necessary for peacekeepers to enter. A peacekeeping mission also implies there is peace first, which is not the case in Syria, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said. China supports the league's mediation in Syria, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin, but he stopped short of saying whether Beijing would approve the proposal. Along with a peacekeeping mission, the Arab League urged member states to provide political and financial support to the Syrian opposition and to cut ties with Damascus. Syria has said it is simply fighting armed terrorist groups in its country. Jaafari cited last week's bombing of two government buildings in Aleppo, which killed 28 people, and a January bombing in Damascus that killed 26 as examples of terrorist groups -- specifically al Qaeda -- that are active in the country. ""The vast losses in Syria among civilians and security forces is a deep wound,"" Jaafari said. ""We are sad, but we place the responsibility for those losses at the door of those who are attempting to obtain political interests by using Syrian blood as currency."" Residents of besieged Syrian areas such as Homs, where hundreds have died in the past nine days, say it is civilians who are bearing the brunt of the attacks. They describe indiscriminate bombings of homes, snipers in the streets, arbitrary arrests and attacks on hospitals by government forces. The destruction by al-Assad forces has also yielded a humanitarian crisis. Residents in Homs report scarce or nonexistent access to food, water and electricity. The United Nations is putting humanitarian supplies in place for distribution as soon as access is granted, Martin Nesirky, a spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, said Monday. Syrian Arab Red Crescent volunteers were able to distribute food, blankets and other supplies to Homs and another city thanks to a brief cease-fire but say other areas are too dangerous for them to enter, the International Committee of the Red Cross said. Pillay said most of the wounded avoid going to public hospitals for fear of being arrested or tortured. Instead, they are being treated in underground hospitals where hygiene and sterilization conditions are rudimentary and medical supplies are scarce, she said. Speaking in Washington alongside the Turkish Foreign Minster, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton promised to help get aid to those wounded and dying. ""We are increasing our funding to organizations like the Red Crescent, the International Committee for the Red Cross and we're working directly with Syrian organizations at the grassroots to help families who have no electricity, food or clean water,"" she said. Pillay said at least 5,400 people have died since protests seeking al-Assad's ouster began nearly a year ago. The LCC says the toll has far exceeded 7,000.

"Beijing (CNN) -- ""Please excuse me, I can't talk about this."" Clunk! The phone line goes dead. We had tried to get this British businessman to talk about the mysterious death of Neil Heywood. Heywood has emerged from the shadows to be a key link in a story of intrigue, mystery and betrayal that goes all the way to the inner sanctum of China's secretive Communist Party. Heywood was found dead last November in his hotel room in the sprawling southwestern Chinese city of Chongqing. According to media reports, local authorities quickly ruled his cause of death as ""excessive alcohol use."" An autopsy was not performed, media reports said, and his body was cremated. Slowly, however, media reports are raising more uncomfortable questions about Heywood's death. He was married to a Chinese woman and had business interests in the country. He moved in the orbit of a company known as Hakluyt and Co., a British strategic information consultancy formed by former officers of the UK's spy agency MI6. Hakluyt has released a statement on Heywood, saying, ""We had a long history of advising Western companies on China and we are among those who sought (Heywood's) advice. We are greatly saddened by his death."" Now, the British government is asking China to investigate Heywood's death. ""Our embassy in Beijing and consulate general in Chongqing provided consular assistance to the family, as we would in any case involving a British national overseas,"" the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said. ""We recently asked the Chinese authorities to investigate the case further after we heard suggestions that there were suspicious circumstances."" Heywood's family has denied comment. CNN has spoken to a man who says he knew Heywood, but who would not speak publicly because he was worried about his safety. He confirmed the dead man had business in China and said that for someone who supposedly died from an alcohol binge, in his experience Heywood was not a heavy drinker. Heywood's death on its own -- a man linked to former spies, a light drinker dead from apparent alcohol poisoning -- would be suspicious enough. But this case has more -- much more. Heywood has been linked to the scandal and sacking of a man once seemingly destined for the heights of power in China. The rise and fall of China's Bo Xilai . Bo Xilai is what is known as a ""princeling,"" the son of a Maoist-era revolutionary hero. Bo rose through China's political ranks and was appointed Communist Party secretary of Chongqing, a city of more than 30 million people. He quickly became known as an anti-crime crusader. Bo smashed criminal gangs and locked up corrupt businessmen. He won praise from locals, especially the poor. Migrant workers flocked to Chongqing seeking, and often finding, a better life. But Bo also made enemies. He relied heavily on Maoist slogans and revived cultural revolutionary songs. In a country embracing capitalism, Bo cultivated an image as ""redder than red."" Just last month, however, Bo's career started to unravel. His right-hand man and former top cop Wang Lijun spectacularly sought refuge in an American consulate. China axes Bo Xilai from Chongqing after scandal . Wang wanted asylum, apparently fearing for his life and allegedly holding incriminating information on his old boss. This is where Heywood re-enters the picture. The Wall Street Journal, quoting anonymous diplomatic sources close to the case, reports Wang clashed with Bo after raising his suspicions that Heywood had been poisoned. After leaving the U.S. consulate, Wang was taken away by state police and has not seen or heard from since. Less than two weeks ago, Bo was fired from his position, his career and ambitions to enter the politburo standing committee -- the nine men who run China -- shattered. Bo has not been seen in public since. In a year of political transition in China, with a new generation of leaders poised to inherit power, the Bo case has captivated the country. In the rowdy back streets of Chongqing locals gamble, drink and discuss Bo's downfall. On a recent visit by CNN, they praised their former party boss. Some of them openly mocked Vice President Xi Jinping, the man likely to be China's next supreme leader. ""This is a battle of the gods, not ordinary people,"" said one old man, who has seen leaders and revolution come and go. But the gods who made the law in Chongqing are now themselves under investigation. Bo, the man who ran the criminals out of town, now finds himself ousted. And Heywood, found dead in a Chongqing hotel room, may still yet have a tale to tell.","Britain asks China to investigate the mysterious death of a businessman .

"Mount Rainier National Park (CNN) -- National park officials said Monday afternoon that the man found dead in Washington's Mount Rainier National Park is Benjamin Colton Barnes, the suspect in the shooting death of park ranger Margaret Anderson the previous day. Barnes was found around 10:45 a.m. Monday, dressed in a T-shirt and jeans, and lying face-down in a creek near the base of a waterfall in an area popular among hikers. Search teams reached him and positively identified him later Monday, Chief Ranger Chuck Young said. Authorities had launched a massive manhunt across steep, snow-covered and wooded terrain for the 24-year-old Army veteran following the fatal New Year's Day shooting of park ranger Margaret Anderson. ""It's nothing you ever hope to experience, but here it is,"" park superintendent Randy King said of Anderson's death. ""Indications are that this person stepped out and opened fire, so I don't think she had much of a chance."" Barnes also was wanted in connection with a shooting Sunday in the Seattle suburb of Skyway that left four people wounded, CNN affiliates reported, citing the King County sheriff's department. All the weapons that Barnes had with him when he allegedly shot Anderson and then fled are believed to be accounted for, said Ed Troyer, a spokesman for the Pierce County sheriff's department. Authorities expressed confidence that the danger is over now that Barnes has been found dead. Still, the park remains closed, as it has been since Sunday. ""We do not plan on reopening the park (Tuesday), there's still enough going on as far as the investigation,"" King said, adding only that officials will reopen the expansive park ""as soon as we possibly can."" ""We're going to need a little time to regroup,"" he added. The park shooting began with ""a normal traffic stop"" about 10:30 a.m. Sunday, Mount Rainier National Park spokeswoman Lee Taylor said. Rangers had set up a checkpoint between the Longmire and Paradise areas in the park to ensure that drivers had the proper tires and tire chains for their vehicles, park spokesman Kevin Bacher said. The gunman's vehicle ""blew through that checkpoint and didn't stop,"" he said. The ranger at the checkpoint pursued the vehicle, which was traveling at high speed, and called other rangers for backup, Bacher said. Anderson, who was at Paradise, moved her patrol vehicle into position to serve as a roadblock. Dan Camiccia, another ranger, also responded, and ""they confronted him together,"" Bacher said. King, the park superintendent, explained that the rangers ""made a conscious decision to (stop Barnes), so he wouldn't get into the middle of a parking lot, where you've got hundreds of visitors potentially."" The suspect ""pulled up, did a U-turn, jumped out and fired on the two ranger vehicles and shot them through their vehicles,"" according to Bacher. Camiccia was not hit, but Anderson was shot in her vehicle. Anderson apparently did not have a chance to draw her weapon. ""If I was sitting in that car or anyone here, we would be dead. There's nothing she could have done,"" said Troyer, from the Pierce County sheriff's department. ""That guy had something ... high-powered enough that, from any amount of distance, nobody is going to win that gunfight."" Camiccia put his vehicle into reverse and left the scene as the gunman abandoned his vehicle and fled on foot into the forest, Bacher said. Anderson, 34, managed to alert Pierce County sheriff's deputies that she had been shot. Deputies ""tried to get to her, and they were fired upon,"" Troyer said. ""They managed to get a small team together to get to her and get her out of the line of fire."" By the time medics reached her, she was dead. The gunman ran into the park, whose border is about 50 miles southeast of Seattle, authorities said. The park -- the centerpiece being 14,410-foot Mount Rainier, which is considered an active volcano -- covers 235,625 acres in the Cascade Range. Investigators found evidence of weapons and body armor in the gunman's car, Troyer said. FBI Special Agent in Charge Steven Dean said Monday that ""a couple"" of weapons were also recovered outside the vehicle, some of them close to Barnes' body. Authorities used helicopters equipped with infrared cameras and an airplane armed with flares in the overnight search, said Sgt. Tom Martin of the Washington State Patrol. More than 150 local, state and federal law enforcement officers were involved in the search, said authorities. Another challenge for Barnes and the searchers was that much of the park is covered in 4 to 5 feet of snow. Authorities believe that the suspect took a roundabout route before ending up where he did, between 1 and 1.5 miles from where Anderson was shot. Barnes was found in a river wearing a T-shirt, pair of jeans and one tennis shoe, according to Troyer. Chief Ranger Chuck Young said temperatures dipped into the low 30s in that area. ""There's no obvious sign of death other than being really cold on a mountain all night, in freezing water,"" Troyer said. ""The condition he was in, the clothing he had on him, he was not equipped to make it a night or two in the winter conditions that were up there."" Dean said that Barnes had been a communicator, working with radios, while in the Army and did not appear to have any special wilderness training. He'd been found guilty of drunken driving in 2009, the same year a hit-and-run charge against him was dismissed with prejudice, according to a background report. A medical examiner looked at his body Monday at the scene, before it was to be transported out of the park. The woman he allegedly killed, Anderson, was the mother of 4-year-old and a 1-year-old daughters, Taylor said. A ranger at Mount Rainier for four years along with her husband and fellow park ranger Eric, Anderson ""was on the job not for money or for glory but out of a love for wild places and the national parks,"" Taylor said. ""She was a person with a quick smile, a very gentle person, a very competent ranger,"" Taylor said. ""This gunman took the life of somebody who had a great deal to live for and was making great contributions to society by being a national park ranger."" CNN's Patrick Oppmann, Adam Shivers, Chelsea J. Carter, Carol Cratty and Ashley Hayes contributed to this report.","NEW: Benjamin Colton Barnes, the suspected killer, previously was charged with DUI .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Police here have opened an investigation into the search of a man's home by Apple employees, an official said Wednesday. San Francisco police were flooded with inquiries and barraged with criticism after releasing a statement on Friday saying four officers had aided Apple, which sent two of its security officials to search a man's home for a ""lost item."" At the time of the search last month, Apple declined to file a formal report with the police. Apple did not find the device at the man's home, police said. The item they were looking for was a prototype for the next iPhone that was lost in a bar, according to CNET, making this the second time in as many years that an Apple employee has lost a prototype while out for drinks. CNET reported earlier Wednesday that the police had opened an investigation. Lt. Troy Dangerfield confirmed that police are now investigating the case, but he declined to comment further, citing a policy that prohibits officials from discussing open investigations. ""It's not something we can just let pass,"" Dangerfield said. Police officials said they were unable to confirm until Friday that a search had taken place because those involved did not file paperwork, at Apple's request. Apple had not returned an official's initial request for comment, police spokesman Albie Esparza said last week. The official statement came after police finally conferred with Apple. Apple declined CNN's request for comment on Friday. A man told the publication SF Weekly last week that he consented to a search of his home when the people arrived and identified themselves as police. He reportedly said it wasn't clear that the pair searching his home were Apple employees, not police; he also told the publication he would not have authorized the search if he had known. Misrepresenting oneself as being a police officer is a crime, but police are allowed to mislead suspects, said Rebecca Lonergan, a former federal prosecutor who now teaches at the University of Southern California's law school.","Police launch investigation into the search of a man's house by Apple employees .

"New York (CNN) -- A Bosnian immigrant accused of plotting to bomb New York's subway system as an ""al Qaeda terrorist"" has been found guilty on all counts, including conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction, conspiracy to commit murder and supporting a foreign terrorist organization. Adis Medunjanin, wearing a black suit with a gray shirt and tie, gazed at family members as the verdict was read aloud in court Tuesday. His sentencing is scheduled for September 7. ""I want to commend prosecutors for the conviction of Adis Medunjanin,"" Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. ""His conviction stands as a stark reminder of terrorists' desire long after 9/11 to return to the city to kill more New Yorkers."" During the trial, prosecutors said Medunjanin traveled to Pakistan's tribal region with two high school friends, Pakistani-born Najibullah Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay, an immigrant from Afghanistan. His friends have pleaded guilty to planning the attack with Medunjanin, testified against him and are awaiting sentencing. Prosecutors said Medunjanin sought to join the Taliban, but ended up being recruited by al Qaeda to perform a suicide mission back in the United States. Upon their return, Medunjanin and his two friends hatched a plan to rig backpacks with explosives and blow them up, prosecutors said. ""As this case has proved, working against sophisticated terrorist organizations and against the clock, our law enforcement and intelligence agencies can detect, disrupt and destroy terrorist cells before they strike, saving countless innocent lives,"" U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said in a statement on the verdict. Robert Gottlieb, Medunjanin's attorney, said his client ""was always realistic about the environment in which the case was tried,"" referring to U.S. court proceedings in a post-9/11 America. Gottlieb added that Medujanin told him, ""Tell my family to be strong."" In closing arguments last week, Assistant U.S. Attorney Berit Berger said the defendant was willing ""to strap a suicide bomb to himself, walk into a New York City subway and blow it up."" Berger told jurors that al Qaeda leaders assigned the mission to Medunjanin in 2008, while he was in Pakistan's tribal region with his friends. Gottlieb had denied that account, insisting that his client traveled there ""not to join al Qaeda but to join the Taliban in fighting foreign troops in Afghanistan."" He said Medunjanin wanted to join the Taliban to stand up for Muslims and defend Islam, calling all three young men ""immature, naive and clueless"" when they set out. ""They wanted to fulfill some romantic version of jihad,"" Gottlieb said.","Sentencing for Adis Medunjanin is set for September 7 .

"(CNN) -- India will seek to become the No. 1 team in world cricket's Test rankings with victory in the final match of the series against Sri Lanka starting in Mumbai on Wednesday. Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team will seek to overhaul both current incumbents South Africa and their second-placed visitors and clinch a 2-0 victory in the series. ""It will be an added responsibility. Becoming the number one side is not important, we've got to maintain our performance level,"" the captain told the official International Cricket Council Web site. India will be without opener Gautam Gambhir, who scored centuries in the first two matches but will be absent due to his sister's wedding. The inexperienced Murali Vijay is expected to win his second test cap as his replacement. Sri Lanka, meanwhile, have dropped spinner Ajantha Mendis as they seek to bounce back from the crushing innings defeat in Kanpur and register a first victory on India soil. Seam bowlers Nuwan Kulasekara and Dilhara Fernando are vying to take his place, having missed out as Sri Lanka employed a three-pronged spin attack last time out. The tourists will be hoping for a better showing from veteran world record-holder Muttiah Muralitharan, who has taken just five wickets at a cost of 396 runs in the series. ""Murali is a bowler who has done so much for Sri Lanka and can sometimes have an off day. That's the way cricket goes,"" captain Kumar Sangakkara told the Cricinfo Web site. ""That doesn't mean he is any worse a bowler, he is still our best spinner and in my view the best spinner in the world. When you have that quality in the side you have to back that quality and that ability it's no different for tomorrow. ""Murali is still the spearhead of our attack and we back him 100% to turn it around and win a match for us."" Meanwhile, New Zealand's star pace bowler Shane Bond has been ruled out of the rest of the three-match Test series against Pakistan after yet another injury setback. The 34-year-old was man of the match as he claimed eight wickets in the Black Caps' 32-run win in the opener in Dunedin, his first five-day international in two years, but has suffered an abdominal tear. However, seamer Iain O'Brien expects to play in the second Test in Wellington starting on Thursday despite dislocating the middle finger of his right hand. Australia have called up Victorian fast bowler Clinton McKay for the second Test against the West Indies in Adelaide after Brisbane hero Ben Hilfenhaus was ruled out by a knee injury.

"(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry has identified the suicide bomber who attempted to assassinate the country's assistant interior minister last Thursday and released details of a phone conversation between the two men prior to the attack. A Saudi man reads a newspaper featuring a front-page story on Thursday's attack. The disclosures reported by the country's official news agency were highly unusual. The agency, SPA, reported the attacker, Abdullah Hassan Talea' Asiri, a wanted Saudi militant who had been hiding in Yemen, got in touch with Saudi authorities telling them he wanted to turn himself in to Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Naif, the assistant minister of Interior for Security Affairs. After arriving back in Saudi Arabia, Asiri spoke by phone to Mohammed, who agreed to see him during a Ramadan reception at his home in the city of Jeddah. According to a transcript provided by SPA, during the phone call the men exchanged greetings and discussed the importance of the holy month of Ramadan. Mohammed is quoted as telling Asiri that ""one should be careful; evil people would like to exploit all of you. Now only you to fear Allah Almighty and come home."" Later in the conversation, Asiri asked if a special plane could be dispatched to take him to meet with Mohammed. Asiri, escorted by security, was transported to Jeddah, where he met with the prince at his palace. During the meeting, Asiri explained to Mohammed that other Saudi militants in Yemen also wished to surrender but sought reassurances from the prince. According to SPA, a call was then placed to one of the militants in Yemen. While the prince was on the phone, Asiri blew himself up, SPA reported. Mohammed, who is also the son of the country's Interior Minister, was lightly injured in the attack. Saudi King Abdullah was shown visiting the prince in the hospital after the attack on Saudi TV. The king asked the prince why the militant was allowed to get so close him without being inspected properly and searched thoroughly. Prince Mohammed answered the king by telling him it had been a mistake. SPA adds that ""the concerned security authorities opened an investigation into the incident. However, the criminal laboratory and a forensic report have reached conclusions that, for security considerations, will not be announced at this time."" Asiri's name was on a list of 85 most wanted suspects released by Saudi Arabia in February. At the time the list was released, Saudi Arabia asked Interpol for its help in apprehending dozens of the wanted Saudis on the list who were suspected of plotting attacks against Saudi Arabia from abroad. The announcement was significant because it is rare for the kingdom to announce that some of its most wanted terrorists are on the loose. It is also unusual for Saudi Arabia to ask for help in finding them. Some of the suspects on the most wanted list had been released from Guantanamo Bay, returned to Saudi Arabia, and had then gone through a Jihadi reeducation program run by the Interior Ministry, before fleeing to Yemen and taking up terrorist activity once more. Saudi Arabia has been battling terrorism since 2003, when al Qaeda launched a series of attacks inside the Kingdom. In the security crackdown that followed, Asiri, like many other wanted Saudi militants, fled to Yemen. Earlier this year, Saudi al Qaeda and Yemeni al Qaeda merged to form ""Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula."" Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which operates out of Yemen, claimed responsibility earlier this week for the attack against Mohammed. In August, Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry announced that over the past year, 44 al Qaeda suspects across the country had been arrested. While the Interior Ministry is calling the attempted assassination an ""action of treachery and treason"", SPA reports that the Ministry will not change its ""open-door policy"" of granting amnesty to militants wishing to surrender - in particular, ""those citizens residing outside the country"" who wish to ""take advantage of the state-sponsored program of advice and care.""","Wanted Saudi militant Abdullah Hassan Talea' Asiri had been hiding in Yemen .

"(CNN) -- A New Jersey woman traveling to an explosives demonstration in California was stopped at Newark Liberty International Airport after land mine casings were found in her luggage, the Transportation Security Administration said Tuesday. TSA explosives experts were called to the checked baggage screening area in Terminal C when her suitcase set off alarms. Inside the suitcase, officials found three small claymore land mine casings. Two of them were packed with shrapnel, the TSA said in a statement. There were no explosives or detonator in the bag, the statement said. The unidentified woman, from Union, New Jersey, missed her original flight to San Francisco but was allowed to rebook her flight later -- without the weapons, the TSA said.

"(CNN) -- Captain Steven Gerrard scored the only goal from the penalty spot as Liverpool beat Manchester City 1-0 in Wednesday's first leg of their English League Cup semifinal. Gerrard made no mistake with his 13th-minute spot-kick, after City defender Stefan Savic had fouled Daniel Agger in the area, to give Liverpool a narrow advantage to take into the second leg at Anfield in a fortnight. The winners will face either Crystal Palace or Cardiff City, who both play in the second-tier Championship, in next month's final at Wembley Stadium. It was City's second home defeat in three days, having been knocked out of the FA Cup by Manchester United on Sunday. It is in stark contrast to the club's Premier League form, where the leaders have won all 10 matches played at the Etihad Stadium. Who are football's top January transfer targets? City had a great chance to level in the second half when Sergio Aguero intercepted Martin Kelly's poor back-pass, but goalkeeper Pep Reina narrowed the angle and the Argentina international fired over the bar. Aguero also squandered an opportunity from close range soon after, but his unmarked header failed to find the target. Meanwhile, Tottenham drew level with second-placed United in the Premier League, after a comfortable 2-0 home victory over Everton on Wednesday left the London club three points behind City. The home side went ahead 10 minutes before halftime when England winger Aaron Lennon cut inside defender Leighton Baines and evaded Sylvain Distin's challenge before coolly slotting home. Leftback Benoit Assou-Ekotto sealed victory in the 63rd minute when the Cameroon international slammed in a superb 30-yard drive for his first goal since August 2009. The result lifted Tottenham eight points clear of fourth-placed London rivals Chelsea. Meanwhile, there was a shock result in the last 16 of the Italian Cup as Serie A title hopefuls Udinese lost 2-1 at home to Chievo. Udinese lie in third place in the league table having won eight and drawn the other of their nine home matches. However, substitute Cyril Thereau's injury-time winner earned the visitors a quarterfinal trip to Siena. Roma booked a last-eight tie with second-placed Serie A side Juventus as Argentine midfielder Erik Lamela scored twice in a 3-0 home win over Fiorentina.","Liverpool defeat Manchester City 1-0 in the first leg of the English League Cup semifinal .

"(CNN) -- Veteran Dutch coach Guus Hiddink is the latest man to take the reins at big-spending Russian club Anzhi Makhachkala, succeeding Yuri Krasnozhan who resigned before he'd even taken charge of a match. Hiddink has coached his native Netherlands, South Korea, Australia, Turkey and Russia during a long and distinguished career, while at club level he won the European Champions League with Dutch club PSV Eindhoven, and the English FA Cup with Chelsea. The 65-year-old has agreed an 18-month contract at Anzhi, who can boast four-time African player of the year Samuel Eto'o and Brazilian World Cup winner Roberto Carlos among their ranks. The club are owned by billionaire Suleiman Kerimov and their stadium is based in the Dagestan region of Russia but the players fly in from Moscow for home games for security reasons. They are currently seventh in the Russian League. Manchester City complain to UEFA over racist abuse of Balotelli . Hiddink has been out of work since quitting as Turkey coach when they failed to qualify for Euro 2012. It will be his first job in club football for six years and as well as being coach, he will also act as vice president for the club's development. ""At the end of last year we had long discussions about Anzhi and that's why now I made a prompt decision,"" he told the club's official website. ""I'm glad to accept such an opportunity, to work not only with the football team but also with my friends who invited me here. The most significant factor for me is that the club is building plans on football development in the republic. ""This is as important as getting results for the first team and I'm going to pay special attention to this. We spoke much with Suleiman Kerimov about this after which I realized what a grand project I was invited to be a part of. Can Liverpool salvage the Suarez saga? ""I know about ambitions of the owner, the club, the fans, now it's known to the whole world. I'll do my best so that the team's play would satisfy these ambitions.""

The Dutchman had been linked with a return to English club Chelsea, with whom he spent a short stint in 2009 after the sacking of Brazil's World Cup winning coach Luiz Felipe Scolari. Hiddink led the Netherlands to fourth place in the 1998 World Cup and repeated the feat with underdogs South Korea, as they co-hosted the 2002 World Cup.

"(CNN) -- In a New Delhi hospital, a two-year-old girl is fighting for her life after a teenager brought her there three weeks ago, unconscious with severe head injuries and bruises, fractured arms and human bite marks covering her tiny body. All of India began following her ordeal through newspapers and television. Doctors operated on the toddler, opened up her airways and placed her on a ventilator. They named her Falak, which means sky. Her condition remains critical, said Dr. Sumit Sinha of the India Institute of Medical Sciences. No one knows whether she will survive or if she does, whether she will live with permanent brain damage. But that's just the tip of the story. With each day, it becomes more sordid. Once police began investigating Baby Falak's back story, they unearthed a suspected ring of human trafficking. The details sparked new outrage among authorities and the public alike, who say the case raises a host of questions about child abandonment, exploitation and the poor treatment of girls and women in the world's second most populous nation. ""This has turned out to be one of the biggest sex rackets involving minors and child prostitution and sale of women for marriage,"" said Raaj Mangal Prasad, head of India's Child Welfare Committee. ""This shows this is a classic case where the magnitude of trafficking has come to light."" Indians came to know of Baby Falak after a distraught teenage girl, only 14, brought the baby to the hospital, claiming to be her mother. On the night of January 17, the baby just kept crying and crying, the teenager told the Child Welfare Committee in New Delhi. Angered by the tantrum, the girl slapped the baby three or four times -- and bit her. A while later, she said, the baby slipped on a wet bathroom floor and fell on her face. The girl tied a bandage around the baby's head but the wound began to swell. The next day, when the baby did not wake up, the girl took her to the hospital. The doctors said Baby Falak was bruised the color of eggplant and beets. She was in a coma. They did not believe the girl's story. Nor that she was Falak's biological mother. ""My personal opinion would be that it doesn't look like a simple case of falling down,"" said Dr. Deepak Agarwal, a neurosurgeon at the hospital. She was referred to a juvenile center for counseling and police launched an investigation. South Delhi deputy Police Commissioner Chhaya Sharma formed five teams to fan out across India to track down Falak's real family. What police learned in the subsequent weeks was shocking. The teenage girl ran away from home last June to escape abuse from her alcoholic father. The father failed to pay rent, his landlady told CNN's sister network CNN-IBN. A neighbor described him beating his daughter so hard that her red welts were readily visible. ""I have seen with my own eyes how her father used to beat her up with a stick,"" Vikram told CNN-IBN. But her escape led the teenager to more trouble. She told authorities two people, Sandeep and Arti, forced her into a life of prostitution; that Sandeep allegedly raped her first for three days before he found her customers, according CNN-IBN. Months later, the girl met a man named Rajkumar and the two began living together in a New Delhi slum. Police suspect he, too, was sexually abusing the girl. The girl told authorities that Rajkumar brought Baby Falak home in November. It's unclear whether the baby was abused then but on that January night, Falak almost died. ""Once victim hurting another victim because there is no sense of hope, sense of survival they can see for themselves,"" psychiatrist Achal Bhagat told CNN-IBN. In the western state of Rajasthan, police eventually tracked down Munni, 22, the woman believed to be Falak's biological mother. She had been abandoned by her first husband and sold off in marriage when she was 16 to a young man from a Rajasthani village, Sharma said. She was valued at $6,000, according to The Times of India. Munni left her three children behind. ""The family life was very disturbed,"" Sharma said. ""She was convinced that she would not be able to raise Falak on her own."" While Munni's youngest fought for her life in the hospital, police found her other daughter in the state of Bihar, many miles from Delhi and Rajasthan. Her son's whereabouts are still not known. Police scored a breakthrough in the case Friday when they were able to nab Rajkumar, the man they believe is central to the possible trafficking ring. He was caught absconding at the New Delhi train station, Sharma said at a news conference. In all, police have arrested 10 people so far who are believed to have profited greatly from their crimes. They are still probing. No one knows how many babies were abandoned, how many women were married off for a price or how many girls were forced to sell their bodies. The case prompted India's home ministry to review police reports and consider action and reignited national debate on a serious problem in India. A 2011 TrustLaw danger poll ranked India as the fourth most dangerous place on earth for women, behind Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo and neighboring Pakistan. The survey said 100 million women and girls are involved in prostitution and 50 million are ""missing"" in the last century because of female feticide and infanticide. Almost 45% of girls are married off before they reach adulthood. Prasad of the Child Welfare Committee called the problem ""huge."" He said India needs more comprehensive laws on the books and stronger enforcement. This sort of thing happens all too often, Prasad said, and sadly, flies under the radar of a majority of India's 1.2 billion people. But now, a hapless child fighting very publicly for her life has thrust an ugly side of Indian society into the national spotlight.","Baby Falak is fighting for her life in a New Delhi hospital .

"(CNN) -- The mother of Florida A&M University drum major Robert Champion said Wednesday she had been hoping more severe charges would be filed in her son's death, which authorities said was the result of hazing. Pam Champion told ""AC360"" that hazing, which prosecutors said is a term for bullying, doesn't amply describe what happened to her 26-year-old son. ""The term 'hazing' in itself is a very light term,"" she said. ""I don't look at it as being a form of bullying. Hazing is a very brutal assault ... against another person."" Charges were brought against 13 people after an investigation into Champion's death, a Florida prosecutor announced Wednesday. See the list of defendants . Medical examiners said Champion died ""within an hour of a hazing incident during which he suffered multiple blunt trauma blows to his body."" ""This is a homicide by hazing,"" State Attorney Lawson Lamar said in Orlando. The case built by investigators does not support a charge of murder, according to Lamar. ""We can prove participation in hazing and a death. We do not have a blow or a shot or a knife thrust that killed Mr. Champion. It is an aggregation of things, which exactly fit the Florida statute as written by the Legislature,"" Lamar said. Pam Champion said prosecutors explained why they pursued hazing charges, rather than murder or manslaughter. She and her husband, Robert Champion Sr., were anticipating ""something that was a little more harsh."" Eleven individuals each face one count of third-degree felony hazing resulting in death, according to officials. Each one also is accused of two counts of first-degree misdemeanor hazing. State law provides a prison term of up to six years for those facing the more serious charges, Lamar said. Two people each face a single count of misdemeanor first-degree hazing. Sentences in such cases typically call for up to a year in jail. Read what the hazing statute says . Some of the charges involved two other alleged hazing victims who were not seriously injured, officials said. ""It's all related to the same investigation that began with Robert Champion,"" said Danielle Tavernier, a spokeswoman for the state attorney's office. ""Investigators found these two victims during the course of investigating the death of Mr. Champion."" The drum major collapsed in Orlando on a bus, which was carrying members of FAMU's Marching 100 after a November 2011 football game that included a halftime performance by the group. Champion's death more than five months ago brought renewed public scrutiny to hazing, a practice that has gone on for years. FAMU said it has taken steps to eradicate the problem. Authorities declined to identify those who had not been arrested. Two suspects were being held Wednesday afternoon at the Leon County Jail, according to Lt. James McQuaig, spokesman for the Leon County Sheriff's Office. The suspects were identified as Caleb Jackson, 23, and Rikki Wills, 24. Both are charged with felony hazing resulting in death. FAMU is in Tallahassee, the county seat. Joyce Dawley, the head of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's Orlando division, said one person was being sought out of state. Parents: Champion a ""poster child"" against hazing . Attorney Christopher Chestnut said the Champions don't want to see the futures of students destroyed, but ""they want accountability for the murder of their child."" Some university band members have said Champion died after taking part in an annual rite of passage called ""Crossing Bus C,"" an initiation process in which pledges attempt to run down the center aisle from the front door of the bus to the back while being punched, kicked and assaulted by senior members. Band camp, other clubs suspended . An autopsy found ""extensive contusions of his chest, arms, shoulder and back,"" as well as ""evidence of crushing of areas of subcutaneous fat,"" which is the fatty tissue directly under the skin. The Champions filed a lawsuit this year accusing the bus company and the driver of negligence. An estimated 30 people were on the vehicle. Fabulous Coach Lines President Ray Land said before the suit was filed that the company's employees, who were not on the bus at the time, responded quickly after learning that there was an emergency, even following the ambulance transporting Champion to the hospital. Family sues bus company, driver . The school's band director, meanwhile, asked for full reinstatement Wednesday. An attorney for Julian White, placed on paid administrative leave shortly after Champion's death, said White worked to root out hazing over 22 years as director. ""Dr. White remains disappointed that barely 48 hours after meeting with band members that Robert Champion was killed in an extreme, horrific and illegal act of bullying,"" White's attorney, Chuck Hobbs, said in a statement. The death prompted the university board of trustees to approve an anti-hazing plan that includes an independent panel of experts to investigate. ""We are vigorously working to eradicate hazing from FAMU and doing everything within our power to ensure an incident like this never happens again,"" President James H. Ammons and Solomon Badger, chairman of the trustees, said in a statement issued Wednesday. ""Our hearts and our prayers are with the Champion family and the extended FAMU family as we all continue to deal with this tragedy."" Lamar said Champion's death was ""nothing short of an American tragedy."" ""No one could have expected that his college experience would include being pummeled to death, an event that some, early on, mistakenly called a rite of passage,"" he said. CNN's George Howell and Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.","NEW: Mother wanted more severe charges to be filed .

"(CNN) -- A strong 6.6-magnitude earthquake struck Sunday off the coast of Antarctica, prompting a warning that there was a ""small possibility"" it could trigger a tsunami. The tremor was centered in waters south of South America's southern tip, about 334 miles (539 kilometers) west of Coronation Island and 388 miles northeast of Palmer Station in Antarctica, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. It hit at 9:40 a.m. local time (8:40 a.m. ET) on Sunday, according to the federal agency, and had an estimated depth of 6.2 miles. Afterward, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center released a statement saying that there appears to be no threat of ""destructive widespread tsunami"" because of the quake. But the agency did state ""there is a small possibility of a local or regional tsunami that could affect coasts located usually no more than a few hundred kilometers from the earthquake epicenter.

"(CNN) -- The mayor of a Montana college town Wednesday welcomed a federal investigation into allegations that sexual assault and rape complaints were improperly handled. But John Engen, mayor since 2006, was also surprised when he was notified of the probe. ""This is uncharted territory for us,"" he told CNN. The U.S. Justice Department announced Tuesday it was launching a probe into allegations that up to 80 complaints of sexual assault over three years were not investigated thoroughly because of gender bias. Of those, 11 cases involved students at the University of Montana -- at least two involving football players. ""If Justice has enough information that it believes an investigation is warranted, I'm not going to question that,"" Engen said. ""Clearly they have a responsibility to act on whatever complaints they are hearing. I think time will tell whether this was the right call or not."" Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division said the focus of the investigation was not on the number of reported allegations, but on the response. ""Our focus is on systemic issues; that is, do the university and the law enforcement agencies have the necessary policies and practices in place to protect women in a comprehensive and integrated manner,"" Perez said at a news conference Tuesday. The Department of Education is coordinating with Justice officials, a spokesman told CNN. Fred Van Valkenburg, Missoula County chief prosecutor, vehemently defended his office and the police officers involved in the investigations. ""We adamantly deny that we have done any such thing, and we are deeply disturbed with the allegation that we have done so,"" he told reporters. ""I do not believe there is any reason to think that anyone at UM is violating anyone's constitutional rights,"" he said. ""We have not been told even in the most minimal fashion what it is we have allegedly done wrong. We are left to speculate what allegations are being made."" Perez defended the Justice investigation, saying that it was the only way to determine whether there has been any wrongdoing. ""There are a lot of women in this community and a lot of stakeholders in this community who have strong concerns right now,"" he said. In December, the University of Montana initiated its own investigation after allegations of a female student being gang-raped and possibly drugged by other students. The university hired Montana Supreme Court Justice Diane Barz to investigate, and she looked into nine alleged sexual assaults from September 2010 through December. Barz wrote in her report that the university has ""a problem of sexual assault on and off campus."" That report triggered a preliminary review by the Justice Department, which resulted in the investigation. Engen said Perez notified him last Thursday and met him and other officials involved Tuesday morning before the announcement. At least 11 allegations of sexual assault involving students were reported in the last 18 months. And at least two of the allegations are said to involve football players on the University of Montana Grizzlies football team. ""As to the university, we are investigating whether it responds promptly and effectively to allegations of sexual assault and harassment on campus and has taken the necessary steps to combat sexual violence,"" Perez said. University of Montana President Royce Engstrom said the school was ""fully committed to cooperating and collaborating in this investigation. We have taken this matter extremely seriously from day one."" Engen said the Penn State child sex abuse scandal changed the way many people think about campus incidents. ""Missoula is no Penn State,"" he said. ""But I think we are like a lot of places. Our experience is not unique."" In March, the university dismissed football coach Robin Pflugrad and athletic director Jim O'Day. University officials gave no specific reason -- only that it was time for new leadership. But students reacted, some with anger. Andrew Fink wrote on a university Facebook page that the administration was to blame -- not the coach and the athletic director. ""I'm glad I'm not a Grizzly anymore! You hold Robin Pflugrad responsible for the sexual assaults on campus? How despicable! These men should be accountable for their own actions!"" Jason Woodill wrote that the university's handling of sexual assaults on campus was a joke. ""The way the U of M has handled the sexual assaults makes me ashamed to be a student. The level (of) incompetency is blatant and ludicrous,"" he wrote on Facebook. Missoula, a city of about 68,000 people in western Montana, is closely linked to the school. The University of Montana is the top employer in the city, and many local professionals are alumni. The city of Missoula recently launched a campaign called ""It's Your Call -- 911"" to encourage victims of sexual assault and rape to come forward. The city police website now has extensive information answering this question: ""What will happen if I contact the Missoula Police Department about being sexually assaulted?"" ""I think there has been an expectation that as a community, we ramp up our efforts,"" Engen said. ""Ultimately as mayor, my responsibility is to the broader public, its safety and welfare. I want justice done.""","NEW: The mayor says Missoula is in uncharted territory .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigerian unions resumed talks with the government Saturday following days of national protests over corruption and soaring fuel prices in Africa's largest oil producer. The two sides met ahead of a promised labor shutdown of the Nigerian oil industry. In solidarity with protesters, the oil union has threatened to stop production if the government does not reinstate subsidies that will return the cost of fuel to previous levels. A decision to halt production would affect global oil prices; Nigeria is the world's eighth-largest exporter. Throngs of protesters have rallied to demand government accountability and a return of fuel subsidies ended on January 1, a move that doubled gas prices and sent the cost of other goods skyrocketing. ""This is not the first time the subsidy has been removed in Nigeria. For two decades, every single government has done this,"" said Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the nation's finance minister. ""There is a very short memory. It has always resulted in resistance and a strike and so on."" A deal had not been reached to avert the shutdown as talks stretched into early Sunday. While negotiations remained ongoing, one union leader said oil workers will resume their strike Monday. Earlier, labor unions urged protesters to take a break from their five-day strike Saturday and Sunday to stock up on food and water supplies. Stores and supermarkets shut down as part of the national strike were set to reopen over the weekend to allow protesters to get supplies, said Folorunso Oginni, chairman of the nation's oil union, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria. Despite the strike suspension, the deadline to shut down oil production is still in effect unless the government and labor unions reach an agreement, he said. The protests -- dubbed ""Occupy Nigeria"" -- have galvanized the continent's most populous nation. Nigerians accuse their leaders of corruption and misusing oil revenues in a country where most citizens battle grinding poverty. The government has said the removal will free funds to improve the country's infrastructure. But there is a widespread lack of trust in the government to provide the infrastructure -- Nigeria is regularly ranked among the most corrupt countries in the world. ""It is to now to try to move this forward regain the people's trust. They cannot say because of mistakes in the past the country should not move forward,"" the finance minister said Friday. In addition to the protests, the government faces another crisis -- religious attacks that have heightened fears of sectarian violence in parts of the country. CNN's Vladimir Duthiers, Kim Chakanetsa and Nima Elbagir contributed to this report.","NEW: Oil workers will resume their strike on Monday, union leader says .

"(CNN) -- Portuguese distance runner Helder Ornelas has been handed a four-year ban after becoming the first athlete to fall foul of the IAAF's Biological Passport program. After abnormalities in his ""blood profile"" were flagged up in May 2011, the world governing body went back to scrutinize a series of blood test results for the 38-year-old between December 2009 and November 2010. Three experts in the field of haematology concluded Ornelas had used a prohibited substance or a prohibited method and the IAAF referred the case to the Portuguese Athletic Federation for adjudication. Citing ""aggravating circumstances"" the IAAF sought an increased four-year sanction despite it being a Ornelas' first doping offense. Ornelas, who won the Milan Marathon in 2005 and finished eighth in the long race at the 2001 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, did not exercise his right of appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. IAAF President Lamine Diack said: ""Those who try to cheat within the athletics community should be warned that the Athlete Biological Passport is not merely a concept but rather an efficient method to identify, target and catch those who believe that doping is the only route to success. ""Cheaters should also be aware that, if they are caught, the IAAF will seek an increased four-year sanction whenever the circumstances so justify,"" he added in a statement released Wednesday.","Portuguese athlete Helder Ornelas gets four-year ban .

"(CNN) -- Sanford, Florida, city officials have chosen a former Colorado police chief as an interim replacement for the top cop who stepped aside during the furor over February's killing of an unarmed teen. Richard Myers, the former police chief in Colorado Springs, will take office in Sanford at the end of the week, the city government announced Tuesday. A news conference to introduce Myers is slated for Friday. He will take over a department that has been under the microscope since the February 26 killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by a neighborhood watch volunteer. Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee, who attempted to resign last week, will remain on paid administrative leave, according to a statement from city hall. Lee stepped aside as chief after a vote of no-confidence by city commissioners, but the commission voted against accepting his resignation while investigations into Martin's killing are pending. The case drew nationwide protests when police decided against arresting neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, who told investigators he killed Martin in self-defense. A special prosecutor assigned to look into Martin's death ultimately brought second-degree murder charges against 28-year-old Zimmerman, who has pleaded not guilty and been released on $150,000 bail. Prosecutors asked for that bail to be increased after learning that contributors had donated more than $200,000 to a legal defense fund he set up. About $5,000 of that went toward the $15,000 cash Zimmerman put up to post bond, defense lawyer Mark O'Mara said last week. Zimmerman has been in hiding since the case drew national attention, and he has solicited the money not only for legal fees but also for living expenses. O'Mara said the money has been put into a trust he controls, and his team announced Tuesday that a former IRS agent has been hired as a third-party administrator to handle the funds. ""The fund's administrator will have sole discretion regarding the dispersal of funds, and guidelines will be put in place to define reasonable living expenses for Mr. Zimmerman and his family and to fund necessary legal expenses,"" the defense team reported on its website. ""Neither Mr. Zimmerman nor The O'Mara Law Group will have direct access to the funds."" Donors' names are not being disclosed. For the next three to five months, Myers ""will be responsible for reviewing Sanford Police Department's performance as it relates to the Trayvon Martin case as well as provide overall leadership,"" according to Colorado Springs police department spokeswoman Barbara Miller. Myers, a 35-year law enforcement veteran, began his career in the suburbs of Detroit and Chicago before becoming chief of the Appleton, Wisconsin, police department. After that, he took the reins of the Colorado Springs police department in 2007. Myers resigned that post in 2011 after Stephen Bach was elected as the city's new mayor. It was widely reported that the new mayor forced Myers out, and a press release from Myers upon his retirement in October seemed to bear that out. ""When Mayor Bach was elected, I told him I was here to serve, and would do so loyally and do my best to lead the department in the direction he wanted to take the city, until such time that he felt he needed to bring in his own chief,"" the release from Myers stated. ""Consequently, I have agreed to make room for this to happen by retiring from the CSPD."" Attempts to contact Myers for this report were unsuccessful. A month ago, he was asked to consider the role of interim police chief in Sanford, according to Miller. She said she believes Myers is well-suited to what is bound to be a challenging, high-pressure assignment in Sanford. ""Chief Richard Myers is a highly intelligent leader with a great law enforcement background who is skilled at analyzing problems and articulating sound recommendations for positive change,"" she said. ""He will bring a unique understanding and clarity to the situation -- as he has always done. We are excited to hear about his new role."" Earlier this year, Myers served a three-month term as interim chief of police in Manitou Springs, a small community outside Colorado Springs. ""I'm a big fan of Richard Myers. He really did a fabulous job here,"" said Manitou Springs Mayor Marc Snyder. ""He's really going to be able to focus in on the existing situation and build a consensus on the right way to go. I think Richard will be uniquely qualified to find the commonalities in this community and rally them around a common thread."" Myers' time in Colorado Springs ended with a controversy surrounding an undercover sting operation at a Hooters restaurant. In June 2011, a pair of undercover detectives and an underage informant entered a Hooters restaurant to check to see if the employees there were properly checking for identification when serving alcohol. That Hooters had previously been cited for serving minors. The restaurant refused to serve the underage informant but the detectives said they witnessed a waitress continue to serve a pair of intoxicated patrons. The detectives left and the restaurant and the waitress later were cited for serving intoxicated patrons. It later emerged that the detectives had ordered beer and drank at least part of the beer while at the restaurant, and surveillance camera footage of the patrons who were reported to be intoxicated was inconclusive. The charges against Hooters and the waitress were dropped. Chief Myers and the newly elected mayor, Stephen Bach, asked the Colorado Bureau of Investigation to launch an investigation. Their report cleared the Colorado Springs Police Department of any wrongdoing, finding that the officers followed all appropriate procedures. The Colorado Springs Gazette and other media reported that Myers dismissed any notion that the Hooter's controversy played a part in his retirement in a Facebook post. ""For those who have assumed that the controversy about a case at a local Hooter's restaurant was responsible for my retirement, I can easily dismiss that one,"" Myers reportedly wrote. ""Day in and day out, the Office of the Chief deals with so many sensitive issues, whether personnel related, crimes, public policy, fiscal ... this one doesn't even register on the Richter scale.""

"Washington (CNN) -- A convicted American terrorist plotter and his mother lost another legal round Wednesday in their efforts to hold accountable a former Bush administration official who issued legal memos supporting harsh interrogation techniques for suspected enemy combatants. The 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals dismissed a lawsuit from Jose Padilla and his mother, Estela Lebron, who claimed the man's constitutional rights were violated when he was held for years in solitary confinement at a military prison in South Carolina. The issue was whether John Yoo, who worked in the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, deserved ""qualified immunity"" as a government official from such suits. A federal judge earlier had said the litigation could proceed. But a three-judge appeals panel disagreed. ""Under recent Supreme Court law, however, we are compelled to conclude that, regardless of the legality of Padilla's detention and the wisdom of Yoo's judgments, at the time he acted the law was not sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood that what he was doing violated the plaintiffs' rights,"" the court said. Padilla was originally arrested a decade ago on accusations he planned to set off radioactive ""dirty bombs"" in the United States. The Chicago native had been held for 3 1/2 years as an ""enemy combatant"" in military confinement, without being charged in that alleged plot. It was that detention that prompted Padilla in 2008 to file a civil lawsuit, alleging the administration's ""unlawful"" policies violated his constitutional rights as a U.S. citizen. He said he suffered severe physical and mental abuse during his years of isolation in military detention, and wanted to hold individual officials such as Yoo accountable. The Supreme Court in 2004 had heard Padilla's original appeal over his enemy combatant status, claiming he deserved a chance to contest his military detention on constitutional grounds. Supreme Court building to get face-lift . He was arrested in May 2002 at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport as he returned from overseas, where he had been living. He was detained as a material witness in the September 11, 2001, attacks investigation. President George W. Bush designated him an ""enemy combatant"" the following month and turned him over to the military. He was one of the few terror suspects designated by the United States as an enemy combatant since 9/11. Padilla was then held in a South Carolina naval brig before the government brought criminal charges against him. The Obama administration has since abandoned using the term ""enemy combatant."" The current White House has been criticized for continuing many of the anti-terror policies of the Bush administration, including military prosecutions of high-value suspected terrorists held at the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The Obama Justice Department had supported Yoo. But some conservatives have also slammed President Barack Obama for his previous desire to close the prison facility in Cuba and prosecute terrorists in civilian federal courts in the United States. That policy has not been carried out due to congressional opposition. Three U.S. citizen cases, including Padilla's, as well as other appeals from foreign nationals held as enemy combatants at Guantanamo, have tested the government's power to interrogate captives without allowing them regular access to attorneys or the judicial system, on the grounds that they might pose a future threat or know about pending terrorist attacks. The San Francisco-based 9th Circuit appeals court said it was unclear in the two years after the 9/11 attacks whether Padilla's alleged treatment in prison amounted to ""torture."" The legal advice offered by Yoo and other top administration lawyers was intended, said the court, to work through varying differences over interpreting and implementing the detention and interrogation policies. The judges in this appeal appeared to go out of their way to note concerns that Yoo's performance at the Office of Legal Counsel may have in fact amounted to professional ""misconduct."" But the panel said his compliance with department standards was not at issue in the current lawsuit. The Justice Department later released two reports on the interrogation memos produced by Yoo, concluding he ""exercised poor judgment"" but did not ""knowingly provide inaccurate legal advice."" Both reports were summarized in a footnote in the appeals judges' ruling. Yoo's lawyer released a statement saying the ruling ""confirms that this litigation has been baseless from the outset."" Miguel Estrada, who himself had been an unsuccessful nominee to the federal bench by Bush, said, ""For several years, Padilla and his attorneys have been harassing the government officials he believes to have been responsible for his detention and ultimately conviction as a terrorist. He has now lost before two separate courts of appeals, and will need to find a new hobby for his remaining time in prison."" After Padilla was released from military custody and transferred to federal civilian control, he was convicted on terrorism charges. In November 2006, he was added to an existing indictment in south Florida, which alleged Padilla and his co-defendants belonged to a North American terrorist support cell and intended to carry out jihad, or holy war, in foreign countries. Padilla and two others were found guilty in August 2007 of conspiracy to murder U.S. citizens and provide material support to terrorists. A federal court jury in Miami had deliberated for just under two days before handing down the guilty verdicts. Another federal appeals court ruled last fall the 17-year sentence given Padilla was too lenient, handing another legal victory to the Obama administration. A divided 2-1 panel of the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals said the federal judge presiding over the 2007 conspiracy trial did not properly take into account the former gang member's past criminal history when sentencing him. The current lawsuit is Padilla and Lebron v. Yoo (09-16478).","An appeals court dismisses a lawsuit filed by convicted terrorist Jose Padilla .

"Washington (CNN) -- Terrorism concerns surrounding the first anniversary of the death of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden prompted authorities to elevate visible security Wednesday on Washington's Metrorail system. ""There is no specific or credible threat. We are mindful that, in the past, al Qaeda has shown an interest in anniversaries and significant dates,"" said Philip Stewart, a Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority spokesperson. Officers with the Metro Transit Police Department's anti-terror team fanned out in the subway system Wednesday with bomb-sniffing dogs and extra officers, according to Deputy Chief Mark Olson. ""On days such as today, where it is an anniversary, we tend to deploy our forces a little bit differently to provide a little more visibility,"" said Olson. Officials plan to continue the heightened security throughout the week. The transit police are also working with federal agencies and local law enforcement, said Olson. ""Law enforcement agencies from Boston to Washington are engaging in transit-related activities such as high visibility deployment to increase awareness,"" said Olson. The coordinated effort is part of a public awareness campaign, Rail Safety Week. Olson said anti-terror officers did not discover anything suspicious during patrols on Wednesday.","Transit official: ""There is no specific or credible threat""

"Atlanta (CNN) -- The board of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference is meeting to discuss whether to keep its current president. ""There has been speculation"" that President Isaac Newton Farris Jr. will be dismissed, ""but that has not been decided,"" Maynard Eaton, the SCLC's communications director, said Tuesday night. ""His status is uncertain,"" Eaton said. Eaton said the deliberations regarding Farris were ""not about character but about the direction the organization is going to go in the future."" Farris was elected president after the death of his predecessor, the Rev. Howard W. Creecy Jr., in July 2011. The Atlanta-based civil rights group is closely linked to the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., who co-founded the organization along with Ralph David Abernathy and served as its first president. Farris is King's nephew. The SCLC has suffered through internal struggles in recent years as two competing factions claimed to run the organization. In 2010, a Fulton County court ruled in favor of the national board. Creecy became president in January 2011 after King's daughter Bernice King turned down the position, saying she was ""not interested in merely being a figurehead"" and criticizing the ""turmoil, chaos and confusion"" that had surrounded the SCLC for more than a year.

"(CNN) -- Biomedical research is complicated. For patients, the pace of progress can be frustratingly slow. Two announcements last month -- one about biomarkers, the other about stem cell research -- left many of us feeling that for every promising discovery, there are even greater setbacks. We started August with good news about the discovery of an Alzheimer's biological marker in spinal fluid that will allow earlier diagnosis of patients who are experiencing some memory loss. It may not sound sexy. But for Alzheimer's patients and their loved ones, the significance of this finding is hard to overstate. Biomarkers, which are substances or characteristics in our bodies that are associated with the risk or presence of disease, are critical tools in the quest for therapies that can slow or stop the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Until now, Alzheimer's researchers, like those in the Parkinson's field, have not had the benefit of a biomarker to guide their discovery. This major breakthrough was the result of an unprecedented data sharing and collaboration. A consortium of scientists and executives across academia, government, industry, and the nonprofit world pooled their collective interests into one larger, collaborative platform, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). In just six years -- a relatively short time in biomedical research -- they announced success. But with this one step forward came two steps backward two weeks ago when a U.S. judge granted a preliminary injunction to halt federal funding for embryonic stem cell research. This ruling, which is even more restrictive than President Bush's stem cell research policies, goes against the beliefs of the majority of Americans (in an August 2010 poll conducted by Research!America, 70 percent of respondents said they favor expanded funding for stem cell research) and wastes more precious time for the millions of people suffering from chronic diseases. As a person with Parkinson's, it's hugely frustrating to think that one decision can actively hold back research that holds promise to transform lives. Patients with neurodegenerative diseases dream of the day when disease-modifying treatments are found, instead of therapies that simply mask symptoms. Disease-modifying therapies create the possibility of newly diagnosed patients never having to experience full-blown disease. The Michael J. Fox Foundation has long championed the scientific freedom to pursue all promising paths to finding these treatments. Biomarker discovery and stem cell science are among the innovative areas of biomedical research that hold potential to speed progress. So while our foundation gears up to launch its most ambitious biomarker discovery project to date, the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative, with ADNI as a precedent, we'll also be standing with Parkinson's patients, their loved ones and the majority of Americans who want us to move beyond political agendas and advance the promise of stem cell research. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael J. Fox.","Michael J. Fox says August brought good news, bad news for research on chronic disease .

"(CNN) -- The mother of an Ohio-born man is ""hanging on by a thread"" after her son disappeared earlier this month in violence-wracked Syria, according to family members. Obada Mzaik, a dual American and Syrian citizen, went missing on January 3 after he traveled with his brother on a flight from Detroit to Damascus, his uncle, Dr. Firas Nashef, told CNN. Mzaik was studying civil engineering at a private university in the Syrian capital and had planned to pursue a master's degree in the United States, his uncle said. The 21-year-old student was born in Columbus, Ohio, but moved with his family back to Syria when he was child. He had enrolled in a seasonal program at a Michigan community college. His uncle said Mzaik returned to Syria earlier this month with his brother, Obaie Mzaik, to visit family and prepare for the start of the new semester in Damascus. The 19-year-old brother said that upon their arrival, they were detained by security officers for questioning, according to Nashef. The younger brother was soon released, but the officers kept Obada Mzaik for further questioning. ""In his mind, he was expecting to see his brother in the morning,"" said Nashef. ""But that never happened."" Mzaik's family is now fearing the worst. ""We hear some horrendous stories from over there,"" said Nashef. ""And my sister is hanging on by a thread,"" he said of the missing student's mother. ""We're all hanging on with a bit of hope. But she's angry and she has no information."" This month's arrest isn't the first time the 21-year-old has been detained by Syrian security forces. Last summer, he was arrested and held for 37 days for ""spreading fliers about the revolution,"" according to his uncle. A Facebook page, meanwhile, is calling for Mzaik's release. The U.S. State Department also weighed in Tuesday, saying it's aware of reports of his disappearance. ""We are working with local authorities to ascertain (Mzaik's) welfare and whereabouts,"" said State Department spokesman Noel Clay. Mzaik is at least the second U.S. citizen to have disappeared this month in Syria, raising questions as to whether the missing men could usher in a more public State Department presence in the restive country. Abdelkader Chaar, 22, is thought to have been arrested in Aleppo, Syria, five days after Mzaik disappeared. Chaar was born in Syracuse, New York, moved to Aleppo with his parents when he was a boy and is a medical student at Aleppo University, his uncle said. His family has not been told why he was arrested, said Sam Chaar, who spoke to CNN from Arizona. Read more about the arrest of Chaar . The disappearances of both men come as anti-government demonstrations raged throughout the country. Protesters last week focused their attention on political prisoners and demanded the release of detainees. At least 10 people were slain in clashes Friday, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an opposition activist group. For more than 10 months, Syria has been in the throes of an anti-government public uprising and a brutal security crackdown against protesters. The United Nations last month estimated more than 5,000 deaths since mid-March. Opposition groups estimate more than 6,000 people have died. Also, the Arab League is extending its monitoring mission to see whether the government is adhering to an agreement to end the violence. Arab League extends its mission in Syria .

"(CNN) -- Luis Suarez returned to Liverpool colors after an eight-game ban but the Uruguay striker couldn't transform his side's home fortunes as they were held to a 0-0 draw by Tottenham in the English Premier League. Suarez's enforced spell on the sidelines came after the English Football Association found him guilty of racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra, but he couldn't break the deadlock in a tense game. The point was a blow for both teams as third-placed Tottenham failed to grab a victory that would have seen them close within five points of leaders Manchester CIty, and three points of Manchester United in second. For Liverpool, the draw is their eighth at Anfield this season -- a run that has hit their chances of qualifying for the European Champions League. They sit seventh, four points behind Chelsea in fourth. After the match Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish suggested Suarez shouldn't have been banned in the first place. He told Sky Sports: ""I'm delighted that he is back. He should never have been away but we've taken the punishment and we've moved on. It would have been unfair to start him, he's not played since Boxing Day."" Heavy fog in Liverpool meant that Tottenham's manager Harry Redknapp was unable to attend the match -- his flight from London was canceled after he had spent the day in court where he is being tried on a charge of tax evasion. The first half offered little in the way of chances, Jay Spearing's shot that arrowed just wide of Tottenham goalkeeper Brad Friedel's post the highlight. But the game came to life in the second half as Friedel saved Martin Kelly's long range shot before Suarez was introduced on 66 minutes to a standing ovation. The striker wasted little time making an impact, but for the wrong reasons, as he was booked for kicking Scott Parker in the stomach while attempting a volley. Suarez's strike partner Andy Carroll wasted a clear chance when he blazed over from 12 yards out after he'd taken down Steven Gerrard's cross. It was Tottenham and Wales midfielder Gareth Bale who had the game's best chance as he went clean through on goal six minutes from time but he sent his shot straight at Pepe Reina. In Spain, Granada beat Malaga 2-1 to climb out of the relegation zone in La Liga. Odion Ighalo's opener for Granada was canceled out by Rondon but with nine minutes left Inigo Lopez scored the winner to move the home side into 14th place. Malaga remain eighth.","Liverpool and Tottenham draw 0-0 at Anfield in the English Premier League .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said Wednesday he will meet with Iraqi political leaders by the end of the month to get their opinions on whether some U.S troops should remain in the country after December, when they are slated to leave. ""This is a big national issue, and it needs a national consensus,"" he told reporters at his office here. Asked whether he would support an extension of U.S. forces in Iraq, he would not answer. ""Do you want me to say this word simply like this?"" he said, declining to answer directly. ""Whole countries have failed to do so and you want me to say it before I gather the national consensus. Try another one."" The 46,000 U.S. troops in Iraq represent about a fourth of the peak force of 171,000 in 2003. Under an agreement with the Iraqi government that was signed by the Bush administration in 2008, all U.S. forces are to be out of Iraq by the end of the year. Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in April that Iraqi officials have not asked the Obama administration to delay the planned withdrawal. Any discussion about a change in the timetable would be considered, he indicated, but would need to begin soon. Al-Maliki said the White House would need to know by August. The prospect of U.S. forces remaining into next year is controversial. Last month, radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr announced in a statement read by another cleric on his behalf that he would ""escalate armed resistance and lift the freeze on (the) Mehdi Army"" if U.S. forces were to remain. His reference to lifting the freeze referred to the August 2007 suspension of activities by the Mehdi Army, which is al-Sadr's militia. If al-Sadr and his militia oppose an extension, they should submit their reasons for doing so, al-Maliki said. ""We should accept on what we agree on and on what we don't agree on,"" he said. But al-Maliki warned that unanimity was not likely. If 70% or 80% of Iraqis were to say yes to an extension of U.S. forces beyond 2011, then ""the rest should accept this decision,"" he said. Their alternative is to withdraw from the political process ""and practice their role as they see it afterward in accordance with the law and the constitution,"" he said.","Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki to meet with Iraqi political leaders to get their views .

"(CNN) -- The coach asked his player whose mother had just died was there anyone back home he wanted the university to contact. Any adult who could help make arrangements. ""Coach, they're all gone,"" the player said. Thomas Robinson, a star player who had turned down the chance to go to the NBA, lost his mother and two grandparents in the space of just a month in January 2011. Now it was just him and his little sister. He was told his mother, Lisa, had died of a heart attack at 43. Weeks before it was the grandparents who helped his single mother raise him. Robinson and his 8-year-old half-sister, Jayla, felt so alone. They had grown up together, 12 years apart, in Washington, Thomas the doting big brother. Robinson's teammates followed him home for the funeral and the school started an education fund for his sister.

He'll likely be drafted among the top 5 players in April's draft and sign a contract worth nearly $4 million a year. ""He certainly has had a remarkable year in large part because I think he's been able to take a terrible situation, tragic, multiple situations and somehow use basketball as his outlet to somehow spin something positive out of it,"" Kansas coach Bill Self said. ""Everybody admires him that comes in touch with him around our camp because I don't know how many guys could do what he's done.""

"(CNN) -- Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi was sworn in Wednesday as a lawmaker for the first time, a key step in the country's recent shift toward democracy after decades of repressive military rule. Suu Kyi, a pro-democracy campaigner who spent years under house arrest, traveled to the parliament in the capital, Naypyidaw, to take up the seat she won in elections last month. It was a historic moment for the Nobel laureate, who has spent decades campaigning for, and being deprived of, human rights in Myanmar. Suu Kyi led her party to a landslide victory the previous time Myanmar held multiparty elections, in 1990. But the military junta ignored the results and kept her under house arrest. She and 33 other newly elected members of her party, the National League for Democracy, took an oath of office for the lower house of parliament that they had initially refused to accept because of its wording, which called for protection of the country's constitution. The NLD considers the constitution undemocratic and has said it wants to change it. The party had asked the Myanmar authorities to adjust the wording of the oath to say that lawmakers would ""abide by"" the constitution rather than ""protect"" it. Suu Kyi and the other recently elected NLD members delayed their debuts in parliament over the issue, but the government of President Thein Sein, a former military official, made no sign of moving to accommodate the request. On Monday, Suu Kyi and the NLD backed down from the demand to have the wording changed, ending the impasse. Suu Kyi said she would take the oath ""for the country and for the people."" She added that her decision had been encouraged by voters, parliament members and representatives of Myanmar's ethnic minority groups. During a visit to Myanmar this week, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed support for Suu Kyi's climbdown over the oath. ""Real leaders demonstrate flexibility for the greater cause,"" he said after meeting with her at her lakeside residence in Yangon. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton congratulated Suu Kyi and her party on the occasion of their swearing-in. ""This is an important moment for Burma's future. A genuine transition toward multi-party democracy leading to general elections in 2015 will help build a more prosperous society,"" Clinton said in a statement, using the other name for Myanmar. ""I encourage all political parties, civil society representatives and ethnic minority leaders to work together to address challenges and seize new opportunities for a more democratic, free, peaceful, and prosperous future."" Myanmar's authoritarian military rulers are loosening their grip on power after decades of stifling dissent and limiting freedoms. Thein Sein's civilian government was sworn in just over a year ago. In the past 12 months, the government has pardoned hundreds of political prisoners, secured a cease-fire with Karen rebels and agreed to negotiate with other ethnic rebel groups. The success of Suu Kyi and her party at the by-elections last month -- the NLD won 43 seats, 34 of them in the lower house -- was welcomed by the United States and European Union as a sign of progress toward democracy. Her presence in parliament Wednesday illustrates the pace at which Myanmar is changing: She was released from house arrest less than a year and a half ago. Next month, she will make her first trip overseas in more than two decades. She plans to visit Norway to make a belated acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize she was prevented from collecting in 1991 because she was in detention. She took her seat in the chamber Wednesday alongside incumbent legislators, many of whom are former military officials. Myanmar's legislature has 664 seats, more than 80% of which are still held by lawmakers aligned with the military-backed ruling group, the Union Solidarity and Development Party. Control of parliament will not change, but the entry of the NLD members nonetheless gives the party a notable presence. Many Western governments have taken steps to ease sanctions on Myanmar, also known as Burma, in response to its political reforms. But international officials have also cautioned that the country still has a long way to go. Speaking last week ahead of his trip, the United Nations' Ban said that Myanmar's ""fresh start is still fragile.""

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Dissident artist Ai Weiwei will not be allowed to publicly appeal a multimillion-dollar tax penalty the Chinese government says he owes, he said Thursday. Ai told CNN by phone that Chinese tax authorities sent him a note March 27 telling him he will not be given a public trial but a ""written hearing."" They sent him another note Thursday saying he must pay the 15 million yuan ($2.4 million) in back taxes he was already ordered to pay, and that he can make no further appeals. Ai, who was found guilty of tax evasion last year, said he plans to sue the tax authorities. Chinese authorities detained Ai for 81 days last year and later ordered him to pay the 15 million yuan in back taxes they said he owed through his company, Fake Cultural Development Ltd. Ai paid 8.45 million yuan ($1.3 million) late last year so he could contest the charges. Had he not paid the sum, he said at the time, his wife would have been jailed. Ai's family and human rights advocates have said they believe the Chinese government is targeting him for his criticism of the regime. An internationally renowned artist, Ai's works -- often with political undercurrents -- command hundreds of thousands of dollars. His 2010 installation at the Tate Modern in London involved 100 million porcelain sunflower seeds, each one hand-painted by specialists in China, spread on the floor of the museum's large entrance hall. Ai helped design Beijing's iconic Bird's Nest stadium for the 2008 Olympics, though he later spoke against the Games.

"(CNN) -- Tim Tebow wants to be an inspiration. As the Denver Broncos quarterback approaches the second round of the NFL playoffs, a documentary offers a detailed look at his quest to convince the teams that he could bring his college success to the pro level. With typical humility, he says he just hopes the film inspires young people. ""I hope it's a positive message for kids who (are) trying to accomplish their dreams,"" he told ESPN's Bill Williamson. ""I want to show them that there are adversity and obstacles for everyone, but you can make it. I am honestly living my dream, but I had adversity and obstacles. I want kids to get hope from this."" Yeah, some of you are rolling your eyes. But Tebow genuinely believes that. And that's one of the messages of the film, says Chase Heavener, who directed ""Tim Tebow: Everything in Between."" Tim Tebow is exactly what he appears to be: a hard-working, squeaky-clean, all-American guy. ""It's really cool to see that it's true. He is who he says he is,"" Heavener said. Heavener is something of an expert on this subject. He's not just a filmmaker who followed the man who is now arguably the most famous quarterback in America. He's also a friend. Heavener's dad and Tebow's dad were college roommates and have stayed buddies. That friendship uniquely positioned the younger Heavener to ask the Heisman Trophy winner and two-time national champion to be filmed constantly through winter 2010. Heavener and his team at Fiction, a video production company, ended up with more than 1,000 hours of film, which were edited to 50 minutes when ESPN picked up the television rights to the project. It was shot in the months between Tebow's last collegiate game and the night he was drafted by the Broncos. The film debuted in January 2011 with ""very impressive"" ratings, ESPN publicist Jennifer Cingari said, and ""it has done well in re-airs, too."" The documentary will get three more airings before Saturday night's Divisional Round game pitting the Broncos at the heavily favored New England Patriots. The cameras follow Tebow and his supporters through the process of preparing for the NFL draft. He hires an agent; plays in an all-star game for NFL prospects; moves to Nashville, Tennessee, to train; and eventually waits in his parents' home to see which team will choose him. Sports Illustrated: Tim Tebow news, photos and covers . More air time is spent on football than personal life, but Heavener says viewers see what makes Tebow a special person and athlete. People who start out ambivalent about the quarterback or even in the anti-Tebow camp tell him that, by the end, they're cheering when the Broncos call on him. ""You get to see that none of things he's gotten in his life are handed to him; they're all a byproduct of how hard he works for it,"" Heavener said. ""I've never seen someone who is so driven and so focused."" In 2010, Tebow prepared for the draft as experts debated endlessly where he should go. The difference in contract for a top pick and a mid-round pick is millions of dollars. But it also sends a statement to the rest of the players about where the team is going. In one scene, as Tebow autographs merchandise with a television within earshot, ESPN analyst Todd McShay tells the TV audience that he thinks Tebow has third-round talent. Tebow doesn't say a word, doesn't even lift his head to acknowledge the comment, while others in the room make sympathetic don't-listen-to-that-guy remarks. ""It makes him work harder,"" Heavener said. ""Instead of taking it in a negative way, he makes it into something positive."" The filmmaker says that's something he's seen from Tebow his whole life, even in high school. Tebow's much-publicized religion is a subtle part of the film. He visits a young gunshot victim in the hospital and leads a prayer with the family. He speaks at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington. He and his mother make a commercial for the conservative religious group, Focus on the Family. ""I approached this as a documentary, so however Tim chose to present his faith that is how we presented it in the piece,"" Heavener said. What you see is ""how Tim lives his life."" The recently released DVD has some important extra material, Heavener says. He feels that the TV version of the documentary really doesn't leave anything out, but he added some draft night material after getting feedback from fans. The TV version goes to black just as NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell is about to announce Tebow's name at the draft. Heavener said he was intrigued by the fact that it seemed women disliked, even hated, cutting it there, while men were cool with the choice. There are 10 more minutes of the announcement and ensuing celebration on the DVD. He also put some outtakes in which Tebow's sense of humor is more visible. ""He likes to rib you a little bit,"" he says. He even uses humor during the most tense moment of the film, when Tebow's anxiously deciding with his agent whether to take the risk of going to the NFL's draft festivities (where he'd be embarrassed if he goes undrafted on the first night). ""You have to have a little fun in life,"" Tebow tells him, an easy smile stretching across his face. He ended up as the 25th overall pick. Since the draft, the focus on Tebow has become steadily more intense. Heavener, now just a friend instead of a documentarian, says he has gone to almost every Denver Broncos game this year. And Tebow remains the same, he says, thanks in part to the people he surrounds himself with. They help bring perspective. One of the things Tebow does to stay grounded is to host a child from the Make-a-Wish foundation every week. He meets with his guest before each game and take him or her on the field. After the contest -- win or lose -- they hang out, talk and cut up. You know, to give the kid some hope.","Chase Heavener spent four months chronicling quarterback's NFL dreams .

"Washington (CNN) -- A former employee of the National Archives was sentenced Thursday to 18 months in prison for stealing rare recordings from the government to sell on the Internet. Leslie Waffen, 67, of Rockville, Maryland, pleaded guilty in October to an eight-year scheme to embezzle historic recordings donated to the government in order to peddle them on eBay. Among the items Waffen took was an original master copy of an interview with baseball great Babe Ruth conducted while he was quail hunting in New Jersey on December 10, 1937. Waffen sold it on eBay in September 2010 for a paltry $34.74. Law enforcement agents later recovered the audio recording, which was still in a paper sleeve marked with the number 2172, its National Archives and Records Administration number. Waffen stole numerous other items, including Herbert Morrison's eyewitness report of the 1937 Hindenburg disaster, a September 1924 transcontinental defense test phone call and the first network television broadcast of the World Series in 1948. Investigators seized sound recordings during a search of Waffen's home in 2010. The government said 4,806 of those items were taken from the National Archives. ""These items were entrusted to the National Archives to be used by all citizens, not to be auctioned for personal profit to the highest bidder,"" said Rod Rosenstein, the U.S. Attorney in Maryland. The federal judge in Waffen's case said losses from the scheme are calculated at $83,238. Another hearing will be held on the matter of restitution. Waffen worked at the National Archives from 1969 until June 2010. The government said that in the 1970s Waffen handled donations of more than 3,000 sound recordings made by a former radio engineer for CBS, NBC and the Mutual Radio networks. That former radio engineer, J. David Goldin, told the Washington Post he saw the listing for the Babe Ruth hunting recording when he was searching the Internet in September 2010. Goldin said he almost bought the item, but realized it was a recording he had donated to the archives years before. ""It was Ruth, and he certainly should have gotten a lot more than 34 bucks for it -- even if Ruth is blowing his nose, people will buy it,"" Goldin told the newspaper. Goldin, a radio historian and collector, assisted law enforcement in its investigation of the stolen recordings.","Former employee receives 18-month sentence .

"(CNN) -- As the Supreme Court prepares to hear arguments in the constitutionality of the health care reform law, CNN spoke with two experts on opposing sides of the issue. Karen Harned is executive director of Small Business Legal Center for the National Federation of Independent Business. The group, along with 26 states, will appear at the court's oral arguments. NFIB represents 350,000 small-business owners. (Ron Pollack, founding executive director of Families USA, is for the health care reform law. Read his viewpoint here). The following interview with Harned is edited for clarity and brevity: . CNN: Has the U.S. reached a health care crisis that justified the law supported by President Barack Obama and most Democrats in Congress? Karen Harned: ""We strongly think that our system is broken, and NFIB for two decades has been aggressively fighting for health insurance reforms. The reforms we wanted unfortunately were not included in the final law. They were reforms that would not drive down the cost of health insurance. That has been the number one issue for small-business owners. ""We are very much not of the 'just say no' crowd, we think the status quo is not acceptable. Our members are very vocal on that. The problem is that the reforms that we advocated were the ones that ended up landing on the cutting room floor and that Congress made a bad situation worse."" Preview: 'The implications ... are impossible to overstate' CNN: But proponents argue there are tax incentives and other benefits designed to help small businesses provide health coverage for their small staffs. Harned: ""Of course, there are provisions in this law that small-business owners like. On the big picture, our small-business owners don't get to pick and choose which provisions of the law apply to them, in addition to the two better provisions. There are numerous new tax increases, but there's also an unconstitutional infringement of individual liberty in the form of individual mandates that require everyone to buy health insurance or pay a fine. So at the end of the day, the small-business owners that we represent saw more bad than good. ""The tax credit has been highlighted by the administration as something that's great for small business, but what we have found is that most of our members are not going to get that full credit. And the extent to which they get that credit, it's just not that significant. Because the amount of the tax incentive goes down as you either add employees or pay them more. It's actually disincentivizing small-business owners to grow their businesses."" CNN: Why in your view is the individual mandate requiring most Americans to purchase some form of health issuance an unconstitutional provision? Harned: ""If it's upheld, then the Constitution is essentially giving Congress the authority to create a command-and-control economy. This is about them telling us all sorts of things that we have to buy or contracts that we need to enter into. This is exactly the opposite of what we want to see -- Congress telling you where you need to be shopping, what you need to buy. Two families, two viewpoints on health reform . ""It also is just amending decades -- maybe centuries -- of contract law because you always have two willing participants. Those are things that fundamentally strike at the core of the small-business owners that I represent; it offends them to no end. As a practical matter, there are dollars and cents attached to this. I've talked to members who say, 'Look, this is a no-brainer.' "" CNN: So you worry the federal government would only expand its authority over commerce? Harned: ""The government has only made this worse in how they've argued this case, because they've been unable in every court they've been in before, to say where it would end. ""As recently as the federal D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals case, where Judge [Laurence] Silberman asked them [the Justice Department lawyers] point blank, 'Is it unconstitutional to regulate broccoli?' and [the government lawyer] said, 'Well, it depends.' Now it's like we're not citizens of this country anymore, we're merely subjects, if this individual mandate goes through."" CNN: Should Congress start all over and craft a new health care bill? Harned: ""NFIB went into this with the intention of striking down the entire law. We have demanded for decades that we get health insurance reform that drives down the cost of health insurance for small-business owners because that market is severely broken. ""We also believe, as the government has continued to argue, that the individual mandate is key, integral, to its operation. Without the individual mandate, it cannot stand. Even some of the provisions that people think are relatively extraneous come back, at least from a cost perspective, to the individual mandate. And if you don't have that, how does the rest of it work? ""... And the answer here is clearly no, because the two things that the law was said to be accomplishing were to increase coverage. The individual mandate is very key to increasing coverage. And reducing costs -- again by getting everybody into the pool, they're basically having the young, healthy people subsidizing the older population. That is supposed to be helping to lower costs for all. ""When you take that out, we don't see how the entire law works as Congress intended. And we definitely don't think Congress would have passed it without the individual mandate."" CNN: What is your message to the Supreme Court as they take on this legal challenge? Harned: ""We think the law is on our side. We think it's very clear that the Founding Fathers never intended to see Congress telling people what products they should buy. If you look at the justifications the government gives, the text doesn't support this mandate, the Constitution doesn't support it, and if the justices rule that the individual mandate is constitutional, they are going to basically open the door for Congress to legislate whatever mandates it finds appropriate that it will impose on individuals. ""We think the law, the Constitution, is very much on our side. That's what they're charged with upholding.""","Karen Harned speaks for the National Federation of Independent Business .
Harned: Reforms that we advocated were the ones that ended up being cut .
If health law is upheld, it will ""create a command-and-control economy,"" she says .

"(CNN) -- The sister of a missing 2-year-old Massachusetts girl saw ""a mean guy"" kidnap the toddler from the beach, her father says, though police insist they have no evidence of any ""mysterious man"" or an abduction. Caleigh Harrison was last seen by her mother and 4-year-old sister at Rockport's Long Beach, on the North Shore of Massachusetts, around noon April 19. Since then, authorities have conducted water, ground and air search for the toddler, to no avail. The missing girl's father, Anthony Harrison, told HLN's Nancy Grace on Thursday night that he believes Caleigh was kidnapped. He bases his belief on what his 4-year-old daughter has told him, as well as drawings by the older sister. Harrison said his older daughter was with Caleigh when she went missing while their mother went to retrieve a ball. ""At first it was the mean guy,"" Harrison said of the 4-year-old's description of Caleigh's alleged abductor. ""And then she got into detail about black shorts, he was smoking a cigarette, he had facial hair."" Harrison first publicly mentioned such a man a day earlier, calling the girl's description ""a little bit scattered"" and among a ""couple of different stories"" he'd heard from her. The children's mother, Allison Hammond, also appearing on HLN, said the older sister ""simply shuts down and says I just don't want to talk about it,"" when she presses her for details. ""She has not acted the same since that day,"" Hammond said of her 4-year-old daughter. ""If you ask her questions about the pictures she's drawn, she becomes expressionless, she just changes."" Massachusetts State Police spokesman David Procopio said by e-mail Thursday that authorities ""have found no evidence to support the abduction theory."" ""That does not mean that we can say with 100% certainty that foul play did not occur, only that we have found no evidence of it -- including no evidence of a mysterious man on the beach,"" Procopio said. That day, Hammond said she'd taken her daughter and her parents' dog to the beach, about 40 miles northeast of Boston, where they played in the water and went for a walk. At one point, Hammond said she threw a tennis ball for the dog ""terribly"" and it went over a wall near some cottages. She then ""got the kids situated ... playing in the sand and by the rocks,"" as she walked over to some stairs to get the ball, Hammond said. ""I could see them the whole way when I was walking over to the stairway ... and they were fine,"" she said of her daughters. ""And one of the times I looked back, Caleigh was just gone."" Hammond said she went down to find her 4-year-old daughter with her ""arms outstretched and she said, 'Caleigh's gone.' She didn't say anything more than that."" Afterward, the mother said she began looking intently for the toddler, who ""was wearing bright pink that day."" She found no sign of her. Nor did authorities looking through ""ocean and tidal areas for several days with divers, sonar, dogs, boots on the ground and helicopters,"" said Procopio. The state police spokesman added that investigators also spoke to a female surfer, two women walking on a sidewalk above the beach, a man playing basketball and others. ""None of them saw anyone or anything suspicious in the vicinity of the family,"" Procopio said. ""Likewise, no one saw her actually fall into the water."" A ""forensic interviewer who specializes in speaking to children (involved in) traumatic incidents"" talked with Caleigh's sister, the police spokesman said, though he wouldn't offer details. Harrison said that he didn't have an explanation why it took two weeks for him to discuss what his daughter told him about the alleged abductor. Regardless, he said he's convinced her story is true. ""I wouldn't put my daughter under this kind of scrutiny (if I didn't believe it),"" Harrison said. ""This came from the heart. And I believe her.""

"(CNN) -- Rescue workers have located the downed Yemenia Airways plane's distress signals, but not its flight data recorders, France's Foreign Ministry said Wednesday. Relatives of passengers on the doomed jet arrive at Marseille airport in southern France. The ministry clarified comments made earlier in the day by the ministry's junior minister for cooperation Alain Joyandet. He told CNN affiliate BFM TV that the ""black boxes"" -- the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder -- had been localized. ""The jet distress beacons were found, instead of the black boxes,"" the ministry later clarified. ""There could have been some confusion."" The Airbus 310 went down early Tuesday, carrying 142 passengers and 11 crew members on a flight that originated in Yemen's capital, Sanaa. The jet took off from Sanaa at 9:45 p.m. Monday and vanished from radar when it was about 16 miles from Comoros' capital, Moroni. The French navy and Yemeni authorities expanded search efforts for wreckage and bodies Wednesday, with a French frigate among the ships joining the search.   Watch what is known about the flight » . Searchers had recovered three bodies, Qadir said. Bahia Bakari, a 13-year-old French girl, was the only known survivor. Her mother was also on the flight, but she has not been found. The girl's father Kassim Bakari told France Info, a French radio network, that his wife and daughter were flying to Comoros to visit relatives.  Watch as airline describes child's rescue » . ""When I had her on the phone, I asked her what happened and she said, 'Daddy, I don't know what happened, but the plane fell into the water and I found myself in the water ... surrounded by darkness. I could not see anyone,'"" Bakari said. Passengers on the flight included 66 French citizens, 54 Comorians, one Palestinian and one Canadian, according to Yemeni and French officials. The crew was made up of six Yemenis, two Moroccans, one Ethiopian, one Filipino and one Indonesian. A number of potential contributing factors were being considered in the crash.  Recent plane crashes » . ""The weather conditions were indeed very troubling and the winds were very strong, reaching 61 kilometers per hour (38 mph),"" Qadir said. ""That's one thing. The other thing was that the sea was very rough when the plane approached landing at Moroni airport."" But French Transport Minister Dominique Bussereau noted that France banned the Yemenia Airbus A310-300 several years ago because of safety concerns. ""People are talking about poor weather conditions, but for the moment, we are unsure,"" Bussereau said. ""It seems the plane may have attempted an approach, put on the gas, and attempted another approach, which then failed. For the moment, we must be careful, because none of this information is verified."" Qadir said it was too early to blame the aircraft for the crash. ""This plane is just like any other plane,"" he said. ""It can have a malfunction, but we don't know what really happened before the investigation is over. And then we can determine if there is a technical issue, bad weather or anything else that may have led to the crash."" It is the second crash involving an Airbus jet in a month. On June 1, an Air France Airbus A330 crashed off Brazil while en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, France. All 228 aboard are presumed dead. The cause remains under investigation.

"(CNN) -- It's perhaps fitting that a story with so many layers should be symbolized by a layer of clothing. From fashion mainstay to symbol of injustice . The first layer, of course, is the crime story: What actually happened between high school student Trayvon Martin and neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman on that fateful February night in Sanford, Florida? Who attacked whom first? The second layer is the law enforcement story: What did the cops know, how thoroughly did they investigate and why didn't they arrest Zimmerman? The third is the legal story: What is the ""stand your ground' law? Did it apply in this case and should it exist at all? The fourth layer is the media story: Why did so many news organizations fail to cover the story for so long and was there a rush to judgment once they did? The fifth is a family story: What if this had happened to your child? Should you tell your kids to stop wearing hoodies? And then, of course, there is the race story: Was the dead teenager suspected and trailed just because he was black? What does it mean that the man who shot him was Hispanic? How much racial baggage has everyone brought to everything that has happened since: the protests, the calls for investigations and hearings, the celebrity videos, the opinion columns and TV commentaries on all sides? More than a month after 17-year-old Martin was found dead, none of these questions has an entirely clear answer. So as we continue to report every aspect of the story, over the next week and a half, CNN will air a series of In Depth reports exploring the larger issues that it raised. On Friday, we will air a special town hall at 8 p.m. ET called ""Beyond Trayvon: Race and Justice in America."" Soledad O'Brien will moderate a discussion among family members and friends of Martin and Zimmerman, law enforcement officials, citizen watch organizers, civil rights leaders, pro-gun advocates, legal experts and concerned parents. The conversation will take place before an audience of ordinary citizens who will participate in the questioning. Starting Monday, ""Anderson Cooper 360Â°"" will launch a week of reports and discussions at 8 and 10 p.m. ET that we are calling ""Kids on Race: The Hidden Picture."" Inspired by the historic Doll Test research of the 1940s and guided by eminent child psychologist Melanie Killen, we will explore how children develop their attitudes about race. What role does family upbringing and circumstance play? When are racial perceptions ""wired,"" and can they be unwired? What disparities exist between the ways white and black children look at the world? O'Brien will join Cooper in guiding viewers through the research, which promises to be full of sometimes disturbing but always fascinating conclusions. As the Martin story continues to unfold, CNN.com will also collect iReport videos reflecting the powerful emotions and opinions that the case has stirred up and telling personal stories about how all of these questions play out in the lives of ordinary Americans. The term ""national conversation"" can be overused, but sometimes it is entirely appropriate, and the Trayvon Martin case is one of them. At CNN, we are determined that our contribution to that conversation be based on sound and unbiased reporting, that it take into account all points of view and that it go beneath the surface of the daily headlines to examine every layer of this compelling but complicated story.","In Depth: CNN takes a thoughtful look at the many facets of the Trayvon Martin story .

"(CNN) -- Five exotic animals once owned by a Zanesville, Ohio, man who let loose dozens of animals last year before committing suicide will be returned to the man's widow Friday, the Ohio Department of Agriculture said. Two spotted leopards, two Macaque monkeys and a brown bear will be returned to Marian Thompson, widow of farmer Terry Thompson. He set off a wide scare in October when he released 50 potentially dangerous animals from his farm before shooting himself. Of the 50 animals Thompson released, 48 were killed by law enforcement, while two primates were killed by the other animals, zoo officials said. Last fall in Ohio: Wild animals on the loose . The five animals being returned to Marian Thompson were never released from their cages by her late husband. A sixth unreleased animal, a leopard, died in January at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, where all of Thompson's remaining animals had been housed for safekeeping since the incident. A state review board concluded Monday that the animals are free of ""dangerously infectious or contagious diseases."" The finding required officials to lift a quarantine imposed in a move in October to delay their return. State officials said they were concerned that Marian Thompson has said she would put the five remaining animals into the same cages they previously inhabited on her Zanesville farm. ""This raises concerns, as she has indicated the cages have not been repaired, and has repeatedly refused to allow animal welfare experts to evaluate if conditions are safe for the animals and sufficient to prevent them from escaping and endangering the community,"" said Erica Pitchford, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Agriculture. State officials have no legal power to inspect the cages before the animals are returned, but they are hoping the local sheriff will seek a court order to inspect the farm ""to ensure the safety of the animals and the public,"" Pitchford said. Thompson had not allowed local law enforcement onto the farm to check the pens, Muskingum County Sheriff Matthew Lutz told CNN Monday. Thompson's lawyer did not immediately respond to a CNN call for comment. Deputies are ready to deal with any problems with the returned animals, Lutz said. ""We have the zoo on speed dial,"" Lutz said. ""If we are pushed to do what we had to do the last time, we would take care of it."" Legislation that would tighten rules regarding private ownership of exotic animals passed the Ohio Senate in April and is now being heard in the House of Representatives. ""Zoo officials encourage lawmakers to pass a bill quickly to ensure public safety and protect the welfare of animals,"" the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium said in a news release. Terry Thompson died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on October 18 shortly after he pried open cages and opened the farm's fences that held his private menagerie of lions, tigers, bears, wolves and monkeys. Authorities, who did not have access to tranquilizer guns, killed two wolves, six black bears, two grizzly bears, nine male lions, eight female lions, three mountain lions and 18 Bengal tigers. Thompson's property is about two miles outside Zanesville, which is east of Columbus along Interstate 70. The 62-year-old had been released from a federal prison three weeks earlier after pleading guilty earlier to possessing illegal firearms, including five fully automatic firearms. CNN's John Fricke and Chuck Johnston contributed to this report.","Two spotted leopards, two Macaque monkeys and a brown bear will be returned to widow .

"(CNN) -- Let's not be simple here. Let's not do what the TV talking heads at the sports networks are required to do. Let's not blather on about the Red Sox and the Rays and the American League East and whether the Yankees, minus their great closer, Mariano Rivera -- who was injured this week -- can still survive in baseball's toughest division and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. To those who have not heard: Thursday evening was quite possibly a landmark moment in the history of Major League Baseball; an Elvis-has-died, the-Wall-has-fallen, there's-some-new-movie-called-""Casablanca"" sliver in time that will permanently dent the long and storied history of America's great game. In short: The best pitcher any of us has ever seen is, in all likelihood, done. Yes, it needs to be said. Twice. Three times. Mariano Rivera, the Yankees' unparalleled 42-year-old closer, is the greatest pitcher of our lifetime. Better than Nolan Ryan and Steve Carlton. Better than Tom Seaver and Greg Maddux. Better than Dwight Gooden in 1985, Pedro Martinez in 1999, Justin Verlander in 2011. In and of themselves, Rivera's numbers are dizzying: an all-time record 608 saves (and 42 more in the postseason), a 2.21 ERA, five World Series titles, 12 All-Star Game appearances. Yet Rivera -- truly the Cy Young of the modern game -- is solely about statistics the way a Maybach is solely about miles per hour. When the native Panamanian crumpled to the ground at Kansas City's Kauffman Stadium, his right knee buckling while chasing a fly ball during the team's batting practice, the majors lost its idealized and perfect figurine. Throughout the course of the long, bitter Red Sox-Yankees rivalry, Boston's loyalists have loathed the pinstriped intruders with unyielding contempt. Reggie Jackson was too cocky, Graig Nettles too combative, Thurman Munson too gruff, Derek Jeter too pretty, Alex Rodriguez too duplicitous. Pick a Yankee -- any Yankee -- and Boston's denizens could find ample reason to damn said person to hell (Hey, Claudell Washington, yooouuu suck!). Yet Rivera, even at his absolute best, when his split-fingered fastball was sawing off bats and numbing opposing hitters, was never hate-able. Or even dislikeable. Or mildly irksome. Throughout his 18 big league seasons, there is not one piece of video showing Rivera talking smack to an opposing player, showing up a hitter or blowing off an autograph request. When asked about rival closers (even Jonathan Papelbon, the crybaby former Red Sox righty), he was always complimentary and deferential. Immediately following Game 7 of the 2001 World Series, when the Diamondbacks' Luis Gonzalez singled off Rivera to drive in the winning run, the closer took his turn at the podium, answering question after question, congratulating Arizona, accepting blame for the loss and offering up exactly, oh, zero excuses. Toward the beginning of this season, Rivera hinted that his career might finally be ending. Though hardly Mr. Loquacious, he spoke of wanting to do other things, of devoting more time to his church and various charities (In 2012, The Giving Back Fund estimated that Rivera donated $627,500 to charity, ranking him the 25th-most generous celebrity). Of stepping away from the mound and uncovering different purposes in life. Always a proud, regal man, after he was hurt Thursday, Rivera told reporters that, were the knee injury to mean he could no longer pitch, he would be fine. ""I never will second guess or question the Lord,"" he said. ""It happened for a reason and you just have to deal with it."" Even when no one -- even a Red Sox fan -- wants to. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeff Pearlman.","Jeff Pearlman: Mariano Rivera, the best pitcher we have seen, is likely out of the game .

"(CNN) -- All apologies, but here we are now, 17 years after Nirvana's breakthrough album irreversibly changed music, and the naked baby pictured on its cover is still chasing dollars. Spencer Elden, 17, recreates his pose from 1991's Nirvana ""Nevermind"" album. Spencer Elden, the underwater infant pursuing a dollar bill on the cover of 1991's ""Nevermind,"" is doing swimmingly these days, having graduated a year early from a Los Angeles-area high school. Being the ""Nirvana baby"" -- as Elden calls himself -- has been profitable. Now 17, Elden says he was paid $1,000 to re-enact the famous pool pose for photographers. Compare that to the original shoot, which paid $200. ""Stuff happens like random cool situations where I get paid $500 just to go hang out,"" Elden said. ""People just call me up and they're like, 'Hey you're the Nirvana baby, right? Well just come and swim in my pool and we'll give you some money.' "" Read more about Elden and the 1991 photo shoot . Not everyone can say their naked baby picture has become part of America's pop-culture psyche. Like Nirvana, Elden hopes to entertain us. He wants to be an artist or graphic designer. Elden has snagged an internship with street artist Shepard Fairey, creator of the ubiquitous Warhol-esque red, white and blue Barack Obama posters. Fairey heard Elden interviewed on the radio and one thing led to another, said the teen. Random fame has ""been a really good foot in the door,"" he said. A Hollywood film role might be in the works, but Elden and his father, who is also a designer and artist, aren't revealing any details. ""Some director's been calling me and wondering maybe about doing a movie with me as one of the characters in it,"" said Elden. ""It sounds like fun."" It's all very exciting, he said, for a self-described normal teen who spends a lot of time drawing. Really, all he wants is a guest spot on the ""Howard Stern Show."" ""I think it would be fun just to hang out and chill with him for a while,"" he said of the XM/Sirius radio host. All the hoopla swirling around Elden proves that Nirvana's musical contribution stands the test of 17 years as a major milestone in music history. ""Nevermind"" has become a pop culture rarity: a specific item widely regarded as a pivotal point in cultural change. The album marks the musical shift from the bouncy, upbeat rhythms and melodies that were popular in the 1980s to the dour and cynical ""grunge"" music that audiences widely embraced in the 1990s. iReport: Show us your grunge days and reflect on ""Nevermind"" With ""Nevermind,"" grunge, as the mainstream press dubbed it, had risen from ""underground alternative"" to the global mainstream. iReporter: Nirvana taught me how to play music . The triumph blew 1980s-style ""poodle-hair metal"" music off the map, wrote Rolling Stone magazine, which in 2003 ranked ""Nevermind"" at No. 17 of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Even when the album ascended to the top of the charts, it made its own rebellious statement, dethroning the King of Pop by knocking Michael Jackson's album ""Dangerous"" from Billboard's No. 1 spot. ""Nevermind"" essentially sowed the seeds for music that defined the 1990s, said Tom Moon, author of  ""1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die."" ""You could argue that whatever American indie alternative rock was, by the time Nirvana came along, it became something different after that."" Front man Kurt Cobain proved himself to be ""a great hooksman,"" said Moon, especially with the album's breakout track ""Smells Like Teen Spirit."" Cobain's verses ""are sort of atmospheric sometimes"" and then ""bust down the door"" with an explosive chorus,"" Moon said. ""They weren't the first to do this, but Nirvana took it in a much more abrupt direction. It's exciting and it still works."" That point was echoed last month when Pitchfork Media, a cultural oracle for indie geeks, listed the song among its top 500 tunes ""from punk to the present."" Time magazine chimed in and praised the song's ""four-chord power sequence that never, ever changes"" which, although unique, mixes the rhythm from Boston's ""More Than a Feeling."" ""If you'd asked one hundred Sex Pistols/Ramones wannabes how F-B-flat-A-flat resolves, one hundred of them would've told you it goes to C, duh. Kurt [Cobain] knocked the world on its ass by choosing D-flat instead,"" wrote Time's Claire Suddath. Nirvana's promise was cut short in 1994 by Cobain's suicide at age 27 in his Seattle, Washington, home. But the band's success opened the flood gates for flannel-clad, angst-ridden rockers including Pearl Jam, Soundgarden and others. ""It was no accident that Alice in Chains, Screaming Trees and bands like that connected in the wake of what Nirvana did,"" said Moon. ""The musical ideas that Nirvana was about were so powerful they couldn't help but spread.""","Spencer Elden, featured on Nirvana's iconic album, is an aspiring artist .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on Wednesday to accept the six-point U.N.-Arab League plan offered by envoy Kofi Annan as a way to halt the violence in Syria. ""Take this path. Commit to it. Or face increasing pressure and isolation,"" Clinton said addressing al-Assad and ""his regime."" The plan won support from the U.N. Security Council earlier in the day, an action Clinton called a ""positive step."" ""The council has now spoken with one voice,"" she said. ""It has commanded a U.N.-supervised cessation of violence in all its forms, beginning with a pullback from population centers by the Syrian government and its forces, humanitarian access to all areas in need, and the beginning of a Syrian-led political process to address the legitimate aspirations of all the Syrian people that will lead to a democratic transition."" Asked whether the plan is enforceable, Clinton said, ""The unanimous support by the Security Council for this plan will add quite significant import to the discussions."" In the meantime, Clinton said, the United States is working on multiple fronts. For one, Annan, the joint U.N. and Arab League special envoy on Syria, is meeting with the Syrian government and with the opposition. In addition, she said, the United States is coordinating with the United Nations on the delivery of humanitarian aid and working with the Syrian opposition to ""strengthen its preparation to participate in the Syrian-led transition process.""

"(CNN) -- GOP presidential candidate Newt Gingrich got a good laugh from his audience of conservatives Friday when he ribbed the U.S. government for not using mail services, such as FedEx, to track down the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the nation. He said the media didn't need to fact check him because he was engaging in ""hyperbole."" Well, it turns out Gingrich's suggestion wasn't far from reality. In a lawsuit filed Wednesday, two Guatemalans allege that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were guilty of unreasonable search and seizure, and racial profiling when they arrested Guatemalan nationals picking up a package at a FedEx facility in Florida. The package contained a passport mailed to one of them by the Guatemalan government in the type of sting Gingrich was jokingly suggesting. ""It is a practical reality that we have the technology that enables us to track -- between UPS and FedEx, we track 24 million packages a day -- while they're moving, and we allow you to find out where they are for free,"" Gingrich told the Conservative Political Action Committee in Washington. ""That's the world that works. Now here's the world that fails: The federal government today cannot find 11 million illegal immigrants, even if they're sitting still. Now, I have a simple proposal: We send a package to everyone who's here illegally, and when it's delivered, we pull it up on a computer, we know where they are."" The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Damaris Roxana Vasquez, a Guatemalan living in Jupiter, Florida, and her friend Gaspar Gonzalez, an undocumented Guatemalan immigrant. It alleges that when the two 21-year-olds drove to FedEx in January 2010, ICE officials arrested Gonzalez and then went to the car where Vasquez was waiting, held her at gunpoint and separated her from her then 2-year-old son, a U.S. citizen. Gonzalez was deported; Vasquez, who was reunited with her child a few hours later, is fighting to remain in the United States. The incident unfolded after FedEx employees inspected the package and alerted ICE officials that it contained a passport. At the time, a representative for ICE said the sting occurred because of concerns over document fraud. The passport was returned to the Guatemalan government. John De Leon, an attorney representing the two Guatemalans, said the lawsuit ""challenges the interaction of private industry and the government in their attack on Latino immigrants in this country."" De Leon said he didn't think the matter should be considered funny by anyone, especially conservatives. ""There's nothing amusing about the idea of government using corporate efficiency in order to violate people's rights,"" said De Leon, who has filed a suit against ICE and FedEx in U.S. District Court in Florida. ""This is a rank operation against a Latino group of people. These passports were lawful passports. There was nothing illegal about them."" He accused ICE of conducting warrantless searches of the packages. ""FedEx can do that, but the government cannot,"" he said. ""Much less FedEx acting as an agent of the government."" De Leon added that ICE also violated international law by limiting the Guatemalan Consulate's ability to get official documents to its nationals in the United States. ""This is a free country. There should be a wall between the police function and corporate entities. Corporations should not become police agents of the government,"" he said. FedEx Senior Communications Specialist Chris Stanley said the company ""has a long history of cooperation with law enforcement. We do not comment on the specifics of that cooperation."" He said he had no details of the case above and directed CNN to federal authorities. The Department of Homeland Security had no spokesperson available for comment. Gingrich told the CPAC audience: ""Let me say for my friends in the news media that was hyperbole, and we don't need a fact check."" Turns out it was closer to the truth than he thought. CNN's Tom Watkins contributed to this report.","Gingrich suggests package delivery companies track undocumented immigrants .

"(CNN) -- A pair of makeshift bombs blew up Thursday inside a Memphis, Tennessee, high school, sending one person to a hospital and two into police custody, officials said. The ""pressurized"" devices, which incorporated Drano clog remover, were placed in different hallways -- one on the second floor, the other on the third floor -- of Craigmont High School, Memphis Fire Department Lt. Wayne Cook said. ""What it appears is that we had a student or two do a prank,"" said Staci Franklin, a spokeswoman for Memphis schools, describing each device as a ""mailbox bomb."" Police received a call around 11:20 a.m. CT to inform them that someone had called the school warning of a bomb, Memphis police Sgt. Karen Rudolph said. After the bomb threat, school staff heard a loud noise and saw fumes, Rudolph added. An assistant principal sought medical treatment after inhaling smoke from one of the bombs while evacuating students, according to Franklin. The injured person was taken to Methodist North Hospital in Memphis, Cook said. Franklin said the school staff member was believed to be OK. Rudolph said that no other injuries were reported. By that time, two possible suspects had been tracked down and taken into custody, Rudolph said. In addition to firefighters, Memphis police and members of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were on site Thursday afternoon, the fire department lieutenant said. Rudolph said members of the police department's bomb unit were inside the school to clear out damage. Craigmont High School is on 50 acres in northeastern Memphis, a few miles from Interstate 40. The school has about 1,300 enrolled students, Cook said.","NEW: 2 possible suspects are in custody, a Memphis police sergeant says .

"(CNN) -- After years plagued by injuries and scandal, Tiger Woods pulled away from his competition Sunday to capture his first PGA Tour win since September 2009. Months after capturing the BMW Championship, Woods became a tabloid fixture for his affairs with several women that led to the end of his marriage. His golf game also suffered significantly in the 3 1/2 years since, thanks in large part to various injuries. Yet he had proved successful in the past at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, having won six times before this weekend at the course in his long-time hometown of Orlando, Florida. He walked up toward the 18th green Sunday to fervent applause, tipping his hat to fans. He ended up tapping in on that hole for par, to finish five strokes ahead of second-place finisher Graeme McDowell. Palmer: The old Tiger will be back . ""It feels really good,"" Woods told NBC, which covered the event. ""(It was) a lot of hard work, I'm so thankful for a lot of people helping me out along the way. It's been tough."" The tournament's namesake, Arnold Palmer, did not congratulate the winner as expected because of a health problem that led to his going to Dr. P. Phillips Hospital in Orlando. Alastair Johnston, chief operating officer of Arnold Palmer Enterprises, explained in a statement that the 83-year-old golf giant's blood pressure -- when checked 15 minutes before Woods wrapped up the contest -- was ""at a level where the doctor involved suggested that he go immediately to get more intensive evaluation at the hospital."" ""I think the blood pressure situation is starting to ameliorate,"" Johnston said after talking with Palmer's daughter. ""Nobody is overly concerned about the prognosis, although he is going to remain in the hospital overnight for observation."" After his victory Sunday, Woods took to Twitter to express his joy and also send out well wishes to Palmer. ""Heading home now and I can't stop smiling. Thanks to Otown fans and everyone watching for all the love. Get well soon, Arnie,"" he wrote. Woods, who has won 14 Grand Slam titles, had won the 2011 edition of the World Challenge tournament that he hosts. But until Sunday, he had been still searching for a comeback win in an event with a full field. His next big tournament will be next month's Masters, the Grand Slam event held each year in Augusta, Georgia. Despite earlier concerns that he may be hindered once again by injuries, Woods expressed optimism and enthusiasm Sunday that he'd do well. ""I am excited. It's always fun to get there, and it's always fun to play,"" he said. ""(It is) all coming together at the right time.""","NEW: Woods writes on Twitter, ""Heading home now and I can't stop smiling""

"(CNN) -- Less than a week after the United Nations declared an end to the famine in Somalia, a new report from the world body says millions of people in South Sudan will now face hunger if urgent action is not taken. The report released Wednesday by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Food Program (WFP) says that fighting in the northern border region and ethnic clashes in many other parts of South Sudan has created a level of food insecurity that could nearly double in the next year. ""Poor harvests, increased demand, rapidly rising prices, displacement and a large number of returnees have all contributed to the situation,"" the report says. ""The situation is dire,"" said Chris Nikoi, WFP's country director in South Sudan. ""This is a rapidly approaching crisis that the world cannot afford to ignore."" Under a normal functioning market, food insecurity and increased demand might have been addressed, the report says, but border closures that link the newly independent South Sudan to Sudan have disrupted the usual supply of food commodities to South Sudan's markets. The fighting along the disputed border regions and ethnic clashes over cattle in multiple South Sudanese states is responsible for the displacement of tens of thousands in the country. The U.N. reported that more than 120,000 people might have been affected in South Sudan's Jonglei state after clashes between the Murle and Lou Nuer tribes have killed hundreds, possibly thousands. Sudan and South Sudan will also be entering another round of talks this week to settle a bitter dispute over oil that seems to be edging the two countries toward more conflict. The WFP says it is scaling up operations to reach the millions of people at risk, but is trying to meet its goal of $160 million in donor support. The FAO is hoping for $23 million in donor support.","Millions could face food shortages and hunger in South Sudan, the U.N. says .

"(WIRED)  -- It's too late to stop WikiLeaks from publishing thousands more classified documents, nabbed from the Pentagon's secret network. But the U.S. military is telling its troops to stop using CDs, DVDs, thumb drives and every other form of removable media -- or risk a court martial. Maj. Gen. Richard Webber, commander of Air Force Network Operations, issued the December 3 ""Cyber Control Order"" -- obtained by Danger Room -- which directs airmen to ""immediately cease use of removable media on all systems, servers, and stand alone machines residing on SIPRNET,"" the Defense Department's secret network. Similar directives have gone out to the military's other branches. ""Unauthorized data transfers routinely occur on classified networks using removable media and are a method the insider threat uses to exploit classified information. To mitigate the activity, all Air Force organizations must immediately suspend all SIPRNET data transfer activities on removable media,"" the order adds. It's one of a number of moves the Defense Department is making to prevent further disclosures of secret information in the wake of the WikiLeaks document dumps. Pfc. Bradley Manning says he downloaded hundreds of thousands of files from SIPRNET to a CD marked ""Lady Gaga"" before giving the files to WikiLeaks. To stop that from happening again, an August internal review suggested that the Pentagon disable all classified computers' ability to write to removable media. About 60 percent of military machines are now connected to a Host Based Security System, which looks for anomalous behavior. And now there's this disk-banning order. One military source who works on these networks says it will make the job harder; classified computers are often disconnected from the network, or are in low-bandwidth areas. A DVD or a thumb drive is often the easiest way to get information from one machine to the next. ""They were asking us to build homes before,"" the source says. ""Now they're taking away our hammers."" The order acknowledges that the ban will make life trickier for some troops. ""Users will experience difficulty with transferring data for operational needs which could impede timeliness on mission execution,"" the document admits. But ""military personnel who do not comply ... may be punished under Article 92 of the Uniformed Code of Military Justice."" Article 92 is the armed forces' regulation covering failure to obey orders and dereliction of duty, and it stipulates that violators ""shall be punished as a court-martial may direct."" But to several Defense Department insiders, the steps taken so far to prevent another big secret data dump have been surprisingly small. ""After all the churn.... The general perception is business as usual. I'm not kidding,"" one of those insiders says. ""We haven't turned a brain cell on it."" Tape and disk backups, as well as hard drive removals, will continue as normal in the military's Secure Compartmented Information Facilities, where top-secret information is discussed and handled. And removable drives have been banned on SIPRNET before. Two years ago, the Pentagon forbade the media's use after the drives and disks helped spread a relatively unsophisticated worm onto hundreds of thousands of computers. The ban was lifted this February, after the worm cleanup effort, dubbed ""Operational Buckshot Yankee,"" was finally completed. Shortly thereafter, Manning says he started passing information to WikiLeaks. Specialists at the National Security Agency are looking for additional technical ways to limit, disable or audit military users' actions. Darpa, the Pentagon's leading-edge research arm, has launched an effort to ""greatly increase the accuracy, rate and speed with which insider threats are detected ... within government and military interest networks."" But, like all Darpa projects, this one won't be ready to deploy for years -- if ever. For now, the Pentagon is stuck with more conventional methods to WikiLeak-proof its networks.

"(CNN) -- Aquatic ecologist Magdy Khalil has the most unusual of jobs. He's traveling from community to community along the river Nile, teaching Egyptian fishermen and farmers about the American crayfish. Procambarus Clarkii: A blight, but maybe also a boon for Egypt's Nile. That's because Egypt's best-known river is suffering from a crayfish invasion. Procambarus Clarkii to be exact. It's a native of Louisiana and relatively new to Egypt. Now it's clawing and burrowing is damaging Nile river fishing and farming industries. ""In the 1980's somebody came to me and said that there was a new creature in the river Nile,"" says Khalil. ""After two days of examination, we determined it was the fresh water crayfish. It has no natural predator in the Nile."" With no natural predator, scientists say, the crayfish was free to roam from where the Nile meets Egypt's Mediterranean coast, down toward the arid nation's border with Sudan. The Nile's warm waters and abundant food supply helped the crayfish evolve, Khalil says, to reproduce at twice the rate of other species. Food supply, Egyptian scientists argue, is the source of the problem - and oddly, a possible solution to a growing crayfish threat. Nile fishermen despise the crayfish because it uses powerful double claws to cut through nets, and then help themselves to the catch of the day. ""In an hour, a half hour - just ten minutes - the crayfish can claw my fish to death,"" says Salah Zayed a 56-year old fisherman who says he's been tossing his nets into the Nile since he was a child. ""My catch is worthless."" The Procambarus Clarkii species can also burrow up to three feet underground. Ain Shams University researchers say the crayfish infestation of burrows is causing segments of the Nile Delta's water canal network to collapse. In a country where temperatures can soar above 105 degrees Fahrenheit, water is too precious an agricultural resource to leave to threat from small-clawed crustacean. Many Egyptians so despite the crayfish, it is known locally as ""the cockroach of the Nile."" Theories on just how the American crayfish found its way to the Middle East have reached urban legend status. But it is widely accepted by scientists studying the crayfish invasion that this all started when an Egyptian businessman attempted to expand his fish farm industry by investing in shrimp. ""He bought what he thought were [shrimp] eggs to hatch in his fish farm,"" Khalil says with a wry smile. ""When they hatched into crayfish, they ate all the fish, then burrowed through mud partitions into neighboring fish containments and ate those fish too."" As the story goes, the businessman was so enraged that he took the crayfish and dumped them in the Nile. From blight to disease defense . Khalil and other researchers at Ain Shams University's zoology department are looking at the bright side. Khalil has joined with American research institutions to determine there is an unexpected benefit to the crayfish invasion -- the crustaceans are a natural defense against bilharzia, a parasitic disease that can cause damage to human organs. Bilhariza is spread by a Nile river snail that carries the bilharzia larvae. The larvae can penetrate human skin -- most easily when people living along the Nile river wade through stagnant riverbanks. Despite decades of government awareness campaigns -- Egypt's legendary singer Abdel Halim Hafez died of bilharzia complications in 1977 -- the water-born disease still affects millions of Egyptians. As Egyptian Bilharzia Institute researcher Karem El Homossamey walks along the Nile's west bank outside of Cairo, he points a few Egyptian women calf-deep in the water, washing carpets. Prime candidates, he says, for catching the bilharzia infection. ""We must give more attention to public awareness -- and the importance of the crayfish to make the people of the Nile like it and put it everywhere,"" El Homossamey says. El Homossamey says it's because the bilharzia snail is the crayfish's favorite treat. Ain Shams University ecologist research seems to back that claim. ""We put some fish, lamb, plants, dead chicken -- we found the first thing [the crayfish] selected was the snail, because the shell is very thin,"" Khalil says. He argues areas of the Nile where there are more crayfish, human bilharzia infection rates are low. Khalil is telling crayfish awareness workshop participants that the crayfish is the answer to spiraling food prices. High in protein and cheap to buy, crayfish by the kilogram is making its way to Cairo's street markets. Khalil encourages fisherman to set crayfish traps in their fishing areas, to keep the crayfish out of their nets. Sponsored by a grant from the United Nations Development Agency, Khalil's workshops include a buffet tasting of crayfish cuisine, including a crayfish boil that could put New Orleans to shame. But judging by the frowns on the faces of some fishermen and farmers, it is clear it's hard from some workshop participants to shake the cockroach connotation. According to the Louisiana Crayfish Promotion and Research Board, the crayfish meat industry is responsible for a $120million/year impact on Louisiana's economy. Khalil says if Egypt can develop a similar industry, the profits could be considerable. ""You see in Louisiana they are eating it, cooking it -- there are many festivals for the crayfish. We need to do the same here,"" Khalil says.","Imported crayfish devastating fishing catches in the Nile River .
Yet it could provide means to help combat spred of parasitic disease bilharzia .

"Tehran (CNN) -- Iranian TV aired images Thursday of what it says is a U.S. stealth drone that went down in Iran last week, an apparently intact RQ-170 drone propped on a pedestal and triumphantly displayed. ""Military experts are well aware how precious the technological information of this drone is,"" said Brig. Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Aerospace Forces, according to the semi-official Fars News Agency. There was disagreement among Pentagon officials about whether the drone in the video is real. Military and intelligence officials were analyzing the Iran television footage. One U.S. official said right now the U.S. can't be certain it's the real stealth drone, because U.S. personnel don't have access to it. But he added there's no reason to think it's a fake. However, a second senior U.S. military official said that a big question is to how the drone could have remained virtually intact given the high altitude it is believed to have crashed from. Earlier Thursday, a Pentagon spokesman said the video is being examined. ""We've seen the imagery. There are folks that are looking at it,"" Capt. John Kirby told a news conference. He and his fellow spokesman, George Little, would not comment further on whether the drone is the one that the U.S. military said went missing. They did say that the missing U.S. drone had not been recovered. John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, said his initial impression from pictures sent to him by CNN isn't what one would expect to see after a crash. He said he was guessing that the object is a mock-up prepared for a parade, noting a U.S. flag in the picture. Pike pointed out that the wings in the picture droop down, whereas in most pictures of such a drone the wings are higher than the center, which is good for stability . Bill Sweetman, an aviation analyst, said the craft appears to be the RQ-170 and it looks real to him. If the drone came down in what he called a flat spin or what is known as a falling leaf departure, the plane would be pretty much intact, but the belly would be badly scraped. He said all of the electronics inside would most likely be in one piece. Sweetman doubts the Iranians hacked into the system and took control of the aircraft. It is much more likely it crashed by itself since ""that's what drones do."" And the condition also suggests it was not shot down but was a system failure. There are no burn marks from a fire, no holes and no outward damage. Sweetman noticed a dent along the leading edge but doesn't know what that necessarily means. ""It's fairly clear here from the pictures that the outer wings have been separated. The question is, did that happen in the accident or (did they take) them off to move the aircraft,"" Sweatman said. The CIA and the Pentagon would not comment on the latest development. Two U.S. officials confirmed to CNN on Tuesday that the missing drone was part of a CIA reconnaissance mission that involved both the intelligence community and military personnel stationed in Afghanistan. A senior U.S. official with direct access to the assessment about what happened to the unmanned aircraft said it was tasked to fly over western Afghanistan and look for insurgent activity, with no directive either to fly into Iran or spy on Iran from Afghan airspace. A U.S. satellite quickly pinpointed the downed drone, which apparently sustained significant damage, the senior official said. Aired by the official Press TV network, the video Thursday showed different angles of the unmanned aircraft. It had been flying over the eastern town of Kashmar when it went down, the network said. ""Recently, our collected intelligence and precise electronic monitoring revealed that this aircraft intended to infiltrate our country's airspace for spying missions,"" Hajizadeh said. ""After it entered the eastern parts of the country, this aircraft fell into the trap of our armed forces and was downed in Iran with minimum damage."" Hajizadeh said the plane's wingspan ""is around 26 meters (85 feet)."" It is 4.5 meters (14 feet, 9 inches) long, 1.84 meters (6 feet) tall and ""is equipped with highly advanced surveillance, data gathering, electronic communication and radar systems,"" he said. Hajizadeh said B-2 and F-35 planes have used the technology found in the aircraft, which is guided via satellite link and land stations in Afghanistan and the United States. ""As far as its platform and coating are concerned, this kind of plane has been designed to evade radar systems and from the viewpoint of technology it is amongst the most recent types of advanced aircraft used by the U.S.,"" Hajizadeh said. The official Islamic Republic News Agency and Fars said Iran's Foreign Ministry summoned the Swiss ambassador to Iran, who received an official reprimand for the U.S. actions. Switzerland represents U.S. interests in Iran, which doesn't have diplomatic relations with the United States. Iran demanded U.S. reparations for the act, which it says is ""against every international law and regulation, as well as contrary to the region's peace and security,"" Fars said. Meanwhile, Iran's U.N. ambassador said in a letter Thursday to the world body that the drone flew 250 kilometers (150 miles) into Iranian territory ""to the northern region of the city of Tabas."" The letter from Ambasador Mohammad Khazaee to U.N. Secretary-Genera Ban Ki-moon and the heads of the General Assembly and Security Council did not specify how the drone ended up in the hands of the Iranians, saying only it ""faced prompt and forceful action"" by the armed forces. ""My government emphasizes that this blatant and unprovoked air violation by the United States government is tantamount to an act of hostility against the Islamic Republic of Iran in clear contravention of international law, in particular, the basic tenets of the United Nations Charter,"" Khazaee's letter said. He called for U.N. condemnation of U.S. ""acts of aggression,"" as well as ""clear and effective measures to be taken to put an end to these dangerous and unlawful acts in line with the United Nations' responsibilities to maintain international and regional peace and security."" Shirzad Bozorgmehr, Chris Lawrence, Adam Levine, Barbara Starr, Jennifer Rizzo, Tim Lister, Pam Benson and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","U.S. official: ""We now have no reason to believe"" the drone in the video is a fake .

"(CNN) -- The trial for Jerry Sandusky, the former Penn State assistant football coach accused of molesting several boys, has been postponed until June 5. The trial was scheduled for May 15 but it ""must be postponed to accommodate various logistical contingencies,"" court documents said. Joe Amendola, Sandusky's lawyer, said the delay may still not be enough time. ""We don't know if we will have all the information we need and are entitled to receive prior to the new trial date, but we will do our very best to be ready to proceed to trial on June 5,"" Amendola said. Amendola argued that prosecutors have been investigating the case long before Sandusky was arrested but he has had little time to prepare his case. ""The Attorney General has conducted a three-plus-year secret grand jury investigation in this matter. We've only had a couple of months since we received our first discovery materials in mid-January to begin preparing our defense,"" Amendola said. Sandusky, a longtime defensive coordinator for the Nittany Lions, is currently under house arrest as he awaits trial on more than 50 counts of child sexual abuse. He has pleaded not guilty. The allegations against Sandusky led to the firing of Penn State's heralded head football coach Joe Paterno only months before he died of complications from lung cancer. Former school officials Tim Curley and Gary Schultz are charged with perjury and failure to report a crime in relation to the investigation. In February, Penn State said it has incurred nearly $3.2 million in combined legal, consultant, and public relation fees pertaining to the scandal. Almost $2.5 million of the fees stem from Penn State's internal investigation and crisis communications team costs. Roughly $500,000 has been spent on university legal defense services, the university said. CNN's Jason Carroll contributed to this report.","The trial was scheduled for May 15 .

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- The woman who received the first-ever near-total face transplant in the United States told her doctor she has regained her self-confidence, said Dr. Maria Siemionow, head of plastic surgery research at the Cleveland Clinic and leader of the transplant team. This illustration represents the transformation of a patient who underwent a near-total face transplant in December. The patient, who prefers to be anonymous, is finally able to breathe through her nose, smell, eat solid foods and drink out of a cup, Siemionow told participants of the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Chicago over the weekend. The complex surgery, a 22-hour procedure, took place in December at the Cleveland Clinic. The patient received her new face in one graft from a donor cadaver. ""I believe this procedure is justified because you need a face to face the world,"" Siemionow said.  Watch an animation of the face transplant » . The patient had previously ""suffered severe facial trauma,"" the Cleveland Clinic said. She had no nose, right eye or upper jaw before the procedure, and could not smell or eat normally. People would call her names on the street, Siemionow said. The surgery gave the patient a nose with nasal lining, as well as a palate. This, combined with the olfactory receptors in the brain, gave the patient the ability to smell, Siemionow said. Social reincorporation is as important as the face transplant itself, Siemionow said. At this point, the patient doesn't want to face the ""common world,"" but she is facing her family, the surgeon said. The patient said she is happy because when she puts her hands on her face, she feels a nose, Siemionow said. She can also taste a hamburger and pizza, and drink coffee from a cup, the ""things we take for granted every day,"" Siemionow said. The patient also received lower eyelids, upper lip, skin, muscles, bone, hard palate, arteries, veins and nerves. As for the aesthetics of the new face, Siemionow suggested that restoring function was more important. ""At this point, no one is really looking at beautification,"" she said. Siemionow, who has been working on face transplant research for 20 years, received approval from the Institutional Review Board in 2004 to conduct a full facial transplant. Only patients who had already exhausted all possible options for conventional repair were considered for the transplant, Siemionow said. Currently, cancer patients are not candidates for face transplants because  transplant recipients must take immunosuppression drugs for life so that the body does not reject the donated tissue, Siemionow said. In the future, however, lifelong immunosuppression may not be required, she said. While burn damage is normally patched with pieces of excess skin from a person's own body, this does not work if the whole face needs to be covered -- the skin of the entire back is less than half of what would be needed to cover the full face and scalp, Siemionow said. Previously, three facial transplants had been completed -- two in France and one in China. The Chinese recipient, Li Guoxing, died in July of unknown causes, Guo Shuzhong, a doctor involved in the case, confirmed to CNN. One of the French face transplant recipients was a man who had a genetic disorder that created large tumors on his face. The other French patient had been bitten by a dog. The Chinese patient had been attacked by a bear. European news media recently reported that a surgeon in Spain received approval for another face transplant, which would be the fifth in the world. Researchers are also making headway into treatments for disorders that give rise to facial abnormalities, experts say. They are identifying genes that become mutated and cause the skull and facial features to become distorted. ""We're moving into the arena where we can do medical treatment,"" Dr. Ethylin Jabs, professor of developmental and regenerative biology at Mount Sinai Medical School, said at the conference. One example is Treacher Collins syndrome, a condition found in one in every 50,000 births, which affects the development of bones and other tissues in the face. Scientists have determined that the gene TCOF1 is involved in the disorder, and research is ongoing into the precise function of this protein. By looking at the genetic underpinnings of disorders that lead to facial deformities, scientists can also understand what accounts for the normal differences in face and skull types. ""These are going to be some of the genes that cause some of that variation,"" Jabs said.","Face transplant recipient can now eat solid foods, smell, breathe out of nose .

"(Health.com)  -- Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects more than the mind. The disorder may damage blood vessels and increase the risk of dying early, according to new research presented today at an annual meeting of the American Heart Association. The study included about 286,000 mostly male veterans between the ages of 45 and 81 who served in Iraq, Afghanistan, and conflicts dating back to the Korean War. The vets with PTSD -- who accounted for roughly 10 percent of the study participants -- had more than double the risk of dying during the 10-year study compared to their peers who didn't have disorder, the researchers found. Health.com: Depression, PTSD common among Iraq vets . Twenty-nine percent of the vets with PTSD died during the study, compared to 8 percent of the vets without PTSD. (The overall death rate in the study was 13 percent.) The increased risk of death associated with PTSD held even after the researchers controlled for factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking. A separate analysis involving heart scans from 637 of the veterans found that men and women with PTSD had more calcium buildup in their arteries than vets without post-traumatic stress. Calcium buildup is a hallmark of atherosclerosis (also known as hardening of the arteries), which can lead to heart attacks. Health.com: Surprising heart attack risks . Among veterans with similar degrees of calcium buildup, those who had PTSD were 48 percent more likely to die of any cause during the study and 41 percent more likely to die from heart disease compared to those without PTSD, according to the study, which was led by Naser Ahmadi, MD, a cardiologist at the Greater Los Angeles Veterans Administration Medical Center. ""If a vet has PTSD, they need to be under surveillance for cardiovascular disease as they age,"" says Joseph Boscarino, PhD, a senior investigator at Geisinger Center for Health Research, in Danville, Pennsylvania., and an expert on the link between post-traumatic stress and physical illness. Boscarino did not participate in the new study. PTSD is an anxiety disorder that occurs after exposure to a traumatic event, including sexual abuse and military combat. People with the condition experience recurring, intrusive memories about the event, and may also experience emotional numbness and detachment. Health.com: Traumatized? Playing Tetris may reduce flashbacks . Previous studies have linked PTSD to a greater risk of death and heart disease, but the new study is the first to explore what's behind the relationship. The explanation is likely complicated, says Laura Kubzansky, PhD, an associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, in Boston. Inflammation stemming from constant stress may be involved, she says, but other factors or unhealthy behaviors -- such as not getting enough exercise -- may be partly responsible as well. ""People with PTSD are trying to make themselves feel better in lots of different ways,"" says Kubzansky, who didn't take part in Dr. Ahmadi's study. Behaviors such as smoking ""clearly contribute, but there's something else going on."" It's not clear from the study whether treating PTSD can lower a person's risk of atherosclerosis or heart disease. Still, Dr. Ahmadi says that PTSD should be treated using effective techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy, preferably as soon as possible after the traumatic event. ""If you don't treat PTSD, it's like a vicious cycle,"" he says. Health.com: Can Ecstasy help ease post-traumatic stress? Boscarino says that thousands of veterans have contacted him to ask whether they can make disability claims for heart disease and post-traumatic stress to the Veterans Administration. ""The veteran community is very frustrated right now because they can't get a ruling on this [from the VA],"" he says. ""They have to fight each case over and over again, which is not the case for Agent Orange...or other military disability exposures."" Dr. Ahmadi presented his findings at the American Heart Association's annual Scientific Sessions meeting, which highlights the latest heart-related research and treatment advances. Unlike studies published in medical journals, the research presented at the meeting has not been vetted by independent experts in the field.

"(CNN) -- In terms of age, just two years separate Australian Open finalists Maria Sharapova and Victoria Azarenka. But in terms of what the two young women have achieved in their tennis careers so far, they are poles apart. Since bursting onto the scene as a 17-year-old Wimbledon champion in 2004, Sharapova's model looks and three grand slam triumphs, combined with her rise and fall from the top of the world rankings, have kept her in the public eye. In contrast, the 22-year-old Azarenka is enjoying her finest run at one of tennis' four major tournaments. Thursday's 6-4 1-6 6-3 semifinal win over defending champion Kim Clijsters has put her within touching distance of a first grand slam title. To add extra spice to Saturday's Melbourne showdown, both world No. 4 Sharapova and the third-ranked Azarenka can claim top spot with victory in the Rod Laver Arena showdown . How do you solve a problem like Maria? Tennis' battle with the grunters . ""It means so much to be back in a grand slam final,"" Sharapova told reporters after beating No. 2 Petra Kvitova. ""It's nice to get this far here at the Australian Open again after losing quite early the last couple of years."" The 2008 champion secured her place in the title match with a 6-2 3-6 6-4 win over Kvitova, the 21-year-old Czech rising star who defeated Sharapova in the Wimbledon final last July and also had hopes of replacing Caroline Wozniacki at the rankings summit. For Sharapova, the U.S. Open champion in 2006, becoming world No. 1 again would crown a renaissance which has seen her overcome a recurring shoulder injury which first struck five years ago. It forced her to miss nearly 10 months of action between May 2008 and March 2009. But despite her struggle, Sharapova insisted that winning a second Australian Open is her sole motivation. ""I don't regret anything that has happened -- obviously it would have been nice not to have a serious injury at 21 years old, but sometimes it's just the way things go. The good thing is I found a way to come back. ""It's more about the grand slam win than the ranking. Having been in that position before, it doesn't really add anything for me."" While Sharapova is working her way back to the pinnacle of the sport, Azarenka is riding as high as she's ever been in the world rankings. Her best run at a grand slam prior to this tournament was a semifinal appearance at Wimbledon last year, where she was beaten by Kvitova. ""I really wanted it bad,"" Azarenka said. ""There were a lot of ups and downs, but in a good way."" Azarenka dug deep after being pummeled by former world No. 1 and four-time grand slam winner Clijsters in the second set, earning a crucial break in the eighth game of the decider to propel her to success. ""She was coming up with some incredible shots and I was really going for it. It was important to get that 5-3 lead and keep putting pressure on,"" Azarenka said. ""It was difficult to get back in the match, to keep fighting and to keep going, but that's what it's all about. And I was really, really happy to win the match."" The victory continued Azarenka's impressive early-season form -- she has now won all 11 matches in 2012. ""There's a difference between saying it and feeling it,"" she said of the effect her form is having on her confidence. ""You really have to trust. You really have to feel it. ""You can't just say you believe you're going to do it, you have to work your way through it and always try to make that extra during practice, because it's not coming in one day."" While Azarenka has no experience of a grand slam final, Sharapova will be playing in her sixth. She has won three and lost two -- including a defeat to American Serena Williams in the 2007 Australian Open. It is impossible to split the pair in the head-to-read statistics, with both players having won three of their six encounters. Sharapova won their most recent match in Rome in May, on her way to overall victory at the clay-court event, when Azarenka was forced to retire in the second set. However, the Belorussian had the honors when they met in the final of the Miami Masters in April.","Maria Sharapova and Victoria Azarenka will contest Saturday's Australian Open final .

"(CNN) -- Country music star George Jones has been hospitalized in Nashville for a respiratory infection but is scheduled to be released on Friday, his representatives said. The 80-year-old performer was to stay overnight Thursday for observation, according to a statement on his website. Jones began cutting records in the mid-1950s, turning out genre standards like ""He Stopped Loving Her Today,"" ""White Lighting"" and ""She Thinks I Still Care."" He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1992. He was long legendary for the hard living that he depicted in his songs -- and which earned him the nickname ""No-Show"" among concertgoers. But Jones' last known serious health problems were in 1999, when he survived a car accident that required rescuers to spend two hours cutting him out of his sport-utility vehicle. He developed pneumonia while in the hospital and was placed back on a ventilator, but recovered soon afterward.","Jones is expected to be released from a hospital Friday, according to his website .

"(CNN) -- In his last days in office, outgoing Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour pardoned four men convicted of murder, a state official said Monday. David Gatlin, Joseph Ozment, Charles Hooker and Anthony McCray received full pardons and were released at 1 p.m. Sunday, said Suzanne Singletary, spokeswoman for the Mississippi Department of Corrections. All four were serving life sentences and worked as trusties at the governor's mansion, she said. ""It is at any governor's discretion,"" said Singletary. Gatlin was convicted of murder, aggravated assault and burglary of a residence, she said. Ozment was convicted of murder, conspiracy and armed robbery in a separate case. Both inmates were at minimum security level, she said. Hooker was convicted in a 1991 murder, while McCray was convicted in a 2001 murder, Singletary said. The governor also recently pardoned Nathan Kern, who was serving a life sentence for burglary, she said. Families of the men's victims told CNN affiliates WAPT and WLBT they are outraged by Barbour's decision. Attempts by CNN on Monday to reach Barbour's office for comment on the pardons were unsuccessful. In 1993, WLBT reported, Gatlin walked into the trailer where his estranged wife, Tammy Ellis Gatlin, lived and shot her in the head. The woman's friend, Randy Walker, survived a gunshot to the head. ""Is Gov. Barbour going to pardon us from our aches and pains and heartache that we have to suffer?"" the victim's mother, Betty Ellis, asked WLBT. ""Is he going to pardon a child that had to grow up without a mother? Is he going to pardon me from never being able to feel her arms around my neck again? What is Barbour going to do about that?"" Tammy Gatlin's sister, Tiffany Ellis Brewer, said David Gatlin served less time than her sister lived. ""It's completely unfair,"" she said. ""I mean, he's in jail for 18 years. She was 20 years old when she died and had her child laying in her arms when he shot her in the head. And he's pardoned?"" David Ruth, who was the lead investigator on the case, said there was an apparent communications foul-up. Tammy Gatlin's relatives received a letter from the state parole board Friday saying David Gatlin was not going to be paroled and would next be considered in October 2012. They received a call the next day saying he was being pardoned, Ruth told WLBT. Meanwhile, the family of Ricky Montgomery told WAPT they received a call from the department on Saturday reporting Ozment's pardon. Montgomery, 33, was a store clerk who was slain on the job. Ozment was convicted of his murder. ""Of course it's devastating,"" said Mark McAbee, Montgomery's nephew. ""You know, we go through this and it's reliving it over and over again, when I don't think the general public has any idea of the things these convicts are doing."" McAbee said his mother was incredulous two years ago to learn Ozment had been assigned to work at the governor's mansion. She wrote the Department of Corrections, he said, which told her that he met the requirements and underwent a screening process. ""We have people out on the streets that are sex offenders that have to register,"" McAbbe said. ""This is a man (who) killed somebody. This man took somebody's life, and it's not going to indicate that on any paperwork."" Phil Bryant, Barbour's successor, is set to be inaugurated on Tuesday. CNN's Rick Martin and Dana Ford contributed to this report.","NEW: David Gatlin, Joseph Ozment, Charles Hooker and Anthony McCray are released .

"(CNN) -- African Union forces in Somalia have successfully pushed the Islamic militant group Al-Shabaab out of the capital Mogadishu, a commander told CNN Thursday. The African Union Mission in Somalia, known as AMISOM, is trying to consolidate power for Somalia's weak transitional federal government in Mogadishu, where Al-Shabaab had been especially active in its battle against that government. ""We have managed to beat them off,"" said Maj. Gen. Fred Mugisha, force commander for AMISOM. The government now has control of nearly 100% of the capital, he said. ""This is a very big achievement in my own view and the views of everybody else,"" he said. Al-Shabaab is linked to al Qaeda and is considered a terrorist group by the United States. In Mogadishu, the group was using conventional military tactics, terrorism and propaganda in its fight against the government. But now, ""they are conventionally defeated"" in the capital, Mugisha said. AMISOM is now expanding its forces into areas surrounding the capital, he said. Other forces are fighting Al-Shabaab in Somalia as well. Kenyan forces entered Somalia in October after a rash of kidnappings Kenyan authorities blamed on Al-Shabaab. Kenyan officials say the kidnappings threatened security and constituted an attack on Kenyan sovereignty. Kenyan forces are ultimately seeking to take the Somali port city of Kismayo, described by the United Nations as a key stronghold and source of cash for Al-Shabaab.","African Union forces say they have pushed the terrorist group out of Mogadishu .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A medical doctor in Vancouver, British Columbia, told CNN Thursday that California arson suspect Harry Burkhart suffered from severe mental illness in 2010, when she examined him as part of a team of doctors. Dr. Blaga Stancheva, a family physician and specialist in obstetrics, said both Burkhart and his mother, Dorothee, were her patients in Vancouver while both were applying for refugee status in Canada. ""I was asked to diagnose and treat Harry to support a claim explaining why he was unable to show up in a small-claims court case,"" Stancheva told CNN in a phone interview. She declined to cite the case or Burkhart's role in it.

The charges are in connection with fires at 12 locations scattered through Hollywood, West Hollywood and Sherman Oaks, according to authorities. Stancheva said the refugee applications by Burkhart and his mother were denied by the Canadian government, and she has not seen Burkhart since early March of 2010.

"(EW.com) -- Chuck Norris doesn't endorse presidential candidates -- he anoints political saviors. The actor, an avowed Republican, explains at the outset of an epic editorial on WND that, ""As a six-time undefeated middleweight world karate champion, I have a pretty good idea what makes a warrior."" In the nearly 1,400 words that follow, the fiery-spirited, flame-haired Golden Boot Award winner lays out the ""the trifecta of tyranny"" that Newt Gingrich, his new favorite Republican candidate is facing. Namely, foe Mitt Romney's massive funding, the dreaded mainstream media (MSM), and the ""elite power mongering"" forces within the GOP party itself. As you might expect, Norris's editorial is peppered with phrases that would make you think Gingrich is a ninja assassin under siege of a thousand enemies -- not a doughy former college professor. Check out the top five soundbites below. Honorable mention: ""[Nancy Pelosi] chapped my hide [with] her clear audacity, arrogance and vindictiveness when she vehemently retorted like the wicked witch of the west: 'Mark my words: That man will not be elected!'"" 5. ""Newt spanked (with great audience fanfare) CNN's John King at the South Carolina presidential debate... [and showed his] ability to shut down the power grid of the MSM."" 4. ""While Romney decries that he is not a Washington insider, it is amazing to me that he gloats over the roughly 72 Washington elite who endorse him compared with Newt's 11. Rather than a badge of honor, that's a thorn of shame."" 3. ""Personally, I feel the entire future debate system should be derailed from the media's control and played out exclusively on C-SPAN with questions being fed entirely via the Internet from citizens around the country."" [In Chuck Norris's world, political debates should be argue-to-the-death cage matches in the style of ""The Running Man"" or ""The Hunger Games.""] . 2. ""We must send someone in there who will turn over the establishment to resurrect the principles of our founding fathers and restore our republic."" 1. ""One cannot, in any way, underestimate the grisly enormity of this triple-headed monstrosity. It is a Goliath of ginormous proportions. And let there be no doubt: Only heaven and earth combining their forces will overcome this gargantuan foe."" [Bonus points for use of non-word ""ginormous."" Chuck Norris doesn't follow the rules of grammar -- he rules grammar.] . Considering the colorful language and battle-ready atmosphere permeating the GOP primaries, is there anyone better to throw his hat in the ring than Norris? Then again, given Norris's losing history of endorsements (Mike Huckabee in 2008, Ron Paul just last year), should he throw in the towel as a political kingmaker? Or would the world be a lesser place without his vivid verbal artistry?

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Cuban President Raul Castro has granted Pope Benedict XVI's request to make Good Friday a holiday -- at least this year -- Cuban state media reported Saturday. During his visit to Cuba this week, the pope asked Castro to recognize the day Christians commemorate Jesus Christ's crucifixion, a Vatican spokesman said. The government said it would give workers the day off April 6, the first time Good Friday has been officially celebrated since the 1959 Cuban revolution. Previously, the only other religious holiday the government recognized in Cuba was Christmas, which was deemed a holiday in 1997 at the request of Pope John Paul II prior to his visit to the island. According to Cuban state media, Castro told the pontiff on Wednesday that Good Friday would be officially celebrated this year. Whether Good Friday would remain a permanent holiday is still under consideration, the reports said. In a private meeting with Raul Castro, Benedict also requested that the church be allowed to open Catholic schools and air religious broadcasts, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said during a press conference in Havana. So far, the Cuban government has not responded publicly to those requests.","Pope Benedict XVI made visit to Cuba .

"(CNN) -- What would prompt a 23-year-old man, born and raised in France, to chase a small, terrified Jewish girl into a school courtyard, look her in the eye and shoot her in the head? The very idea brings back memories of the 1940s, of an era that many Europeans have worked diligently, with considerable success, to put behind them. But the echoes of history should not be silenced. The tragedy of Toulouse is a call to take another look at that crucial fight against the poisonous prejudice that ultimately devastated Europe in the middle of the 20th century. I believe an honest examination will reveal a blind spot among those fighting prejudice that has allowed the ancient Jew hatred that infected Europe for centuries to survive. The blind spot is this: When the prejudice -- and even the call for murder -- is made in connection with the Palestinian cause, people look the other way and give it a pass. Blood-chilling security camera video from the city of Toulouse on Monday shows a man we now believe was Mohammed Merah shooting 7-year-old Miriam Monsonego as her mother watched. The chase and murder came moments after he shot two other children -- 4-year-old Gabriel and 5-year-old Arieh -- and their father, Jonathan Sandler, a rabbi and teacher at the Jewish school. Days earlier, Merah had allegedly killed three French soldiers of Arab origin. Initially, the fact that he had murdered both Arabs and Jews made people conclude that this was the work of a racist, right-wing extremist. In recent years, Europeans have been alarmed by anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim sentiment. With a presidential election around the corner in France, the murders quickly took on political significance. But the trail led to Merah, a self-described jihadist. Merah apparently called a television station to explain his actions, saying he wanted to ""take revenge on the law against the full Islamic veil (in France) and also on France's participation in the war in Afghanistan and to protest against the situation in Palestine."" The prime minister of the Palestinian Authority, Salam Fayyad, reacted indignantly to the familiar, phony link. ""It is time for those criminals,"" he said, ""to stop exploiting the name of Palestine through their terrorist actions."" It's not just the criminals and the terrorists who should stop. It is time to stop excusing anti-Semitic calls for the murder of Jews as an acceptable outgrowth of the Palestinian cause. A couple of years ago, I was in the Netherlands when a pro-Palestinian demonstration broke into a familiar chant: ""Hamas, Hamas, Jews to the gas."" The ""Jews to the gas"" is a common cheer at Dutch soccer games. This was nothing new. What was new is that this demonstration included a Dutch member of Parliament, Harry van Bommel of the Socialist Party, who continued along as his comrades called for a repeat of the Holocaust. Political leaders and government authorities often act dismissively when Jews are the target of violence, particularly from Arabs. When a Jewish girl was beaten at school by five Muslim girls who called her a ""dirty Jew"" and shouted that she should ""return to your country,"" community leaders said they were ""exasperated"" by the endless attacks on Belgian Jews and asked the government to take action. Viviane Teitelbaum, a Jewish member of Parliament, condemned the failure of the Belgian media and the political establishment to speak out. The earlier confusion in Toulouse is understandable. After all, when Jews are murdered, the killer could come from the left or from the right. It's easy to blame the situation of the Arab-Israel conflict, but Jean-Yves Camus, a French expert in extremism, says today's prejudice includes the ""new anti-Semitism"" from radicalized Muslims and the old-fashioned hatred from the right, including neo-Nazis. Often, when the Palestinian link is made, the prejudice comes from the left, couched as passion for human rights. At times, human rights activists seem to have no problem with anti-Semitism -- even of the genocidal variety -- condemning it forcefully only if it is accompanied by anti-immigrant or anti-Muslim sentiment. Just days before the Toulouse murders, on March 19, the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva hosted an event featuring a high official from Hamas. That is a group whose easily obtainable charter calls not just for the creation of a Palestinian state, which is something I, like many other people, wholeheartedly support. But Hamas' charter also declares: ""Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it. ... The Day of Judgment will not come about until Muslims fight the Jews (killing the Jews). ..."" If a white supremacist organization advocated genocide as this one does, polite society would keep its distance, at the very least. Instead, polite society contributes to a campaign to demonize Israel, fueling the hatred that is then unleashed against Jews in France and elsewhere. Last week, a U.N. official posted to Twitter a picture of a heartbreakingly injured Palestinian girl, tweeting ""Another child killed by #Israel ..."" Turns out it was a 2006 picture of a girl who died falling from a swing. Back in 2006, Reuters had sent out the same picture, saying she was the target of a military strike, but later retracted it, explaining that the girl was the victim of a playground accident. Portraying Israelis as baby killers fits neatly into the old anti-Semitic narrative that outrageously claims Jews kill Christian children to make Passover matzos. These types of ""errors"" are all too common, and they contribute to an air of anti-Israel and anti-Jewish sentiment. In Europe, that falls on fertile ground. At least 400 anti-Semitic (which means anti-Jewish, for those who will argue Arabs are also Semites) incidents are recorded yearly in France. French Jews have been killed in bombings. Belgian Jewish children are beaten, and Dutch Jews are afraid to wear their traditional head cover outside because it so often leads to pummelings. A just-released survey in 10 European countries found that 24% of the French population holds anti-Jewish sentiment, up from 20% in 2009. In Hungary, Spain and Poland, anti-Semitic sentiment is ""off the charts,"" according to Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League. Surveys show that 15% of Americans hold anti-Jewish views. The sentiment is most common among European Muslims, some of whom have attended Islamic schools, whose Saudi-financed textbooks explained that Jews look like monkeys and pigs and seek ""world domination."" Why would a man kill small Jewish children? The answer has intrigued historians and psychologists for many centuries. But the more urgent question is what we can do to stop it from happening again. And the answer is that the first requirement is telling the truth about anti-Jewish ideologies. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: Toulouse shooting echoes the ravages of last century's anti-Semitism in Europe .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid took another decisive step towards their first La Liga title in four seasons with a thumping 5-1 win at Osasuna on Saturday. Karim Benzema got Jose Mourinho's side off the mark with a sweetly struck volley in the seventh minute before Cristiano Ronaldo scored his first of the night in the 37th minute. Three minutes later the game was effectively over as Argentine striker Gonzalo Higuain made it 3-0. Osasuna briefly rallied after the break as Juan Francisco 'Nino' headed home to give the home fans some hope. But any chances of a comeback were snuffed out 20 minutes later when Ronaldo added a fourth (his 37th of the league campaign) with Higuain claimed his second in the 77th minute to complete the rout. Osasuna substitute Roland Lamah was sent off for a second bookable offence late in the game to compound the misery for the home supporters. Barcelona remain six points behind in second place after a 2-0 win over Athletic Bilbao at the Nou Camp. Andres Iniesta put Barca in front five minutes before halftime blasting the ball into the roof of the net after receiving a pass from Lionel Messi. And the Argentine was on hand to score from the penalty spot in the 58th minute after Cristian Tello was brought down by Javi Martinez. Real Zaragoza and Sporting Gijon swap places at the foot of the table after Zaragoza edged to a 2-1 win at the Estadio El Molinon. Granada earned a vital 1-0 win against fellow strugglers Racing Santander to stave off relegation worries. Meanwhile in Serie A, leaders AC Milan dropped points on the road as they were held to a 1-1 draw by Catania on Saturday. Brazilian Robinho gave the reigning champions the lead in the 34th minute but had to settle for a point after Nicolas Spolli equalized in the 57th minute of the second half. Second-placed Juventus can move to within two points of Milan if they beat Napoli on Sunday. In Saturday's other fixture, third-place Lazio suffered a 3-1 defeat to Parma at the Ennio Tardini Stadium.","Ronaldo and Gonzalo Higuain score twice as Real maintain grip on La Liga lead .

"(CNN) -- Mexico's president called on U.S. officials to stop gun trafficking across the border Thursday, saying the move would be the best thing Americans could do to stop brutal drug violence. ""The criminals have become more and more vicious in their eagerness to spark fear and anxiety in society,"" President Felipe Calderon said. ""One of the main factors that allows criminals to strengthen themselves is the unlimited access to high-powered weapons, which are sold freely, and also indiscriminately, in the United States of America."" Speaking in Ciudad Juarez, the border city across from El Paso, Texas, that has become Mexico's murder capital, Calderon said a dramatic increase in violence in Mexico was directly connected with the 2004 expiration of the U.S. assault weapons ban. The message was familiar. The Mexican president has asked U.S. lawmakers to renew the ban on assault weapons before, most notably in a 2010 speech to the U.S. Congress. But the backdrop Thursday was dramatically different. Calderon stood in front of a massive new sign, constructed with tons of decommissioned arms. ""NO MORE WEAPONS,"" the sign said -- in English. Americans on the other side of the border are the intended audience, Calderon said. ""From here, from Ciudad Juarez, on the border of Mexico and the United States, we say, 'No more weapons. No more weapons to Mexico,'"" he said. Thursday's speech came as a U.S. Congressional inquiry continues into ""Operation Fast and Furious,"" an operation run by U.S. federal agents. Authorities have said the operation was intended to track the flow of illegally purchased American guns to the Mexican cartels -- but in practice, agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives allowed so-called straw buyers to take weapons across the border without being intercepted. Calderon praised U.S. President Barack Obama's efforts to deal with the ""very sensitive issue"" of assault weapons, noting that officials in his administration had done more than previous leaders to investigate and block illegal weapons trafficking to Mexico. ""They have taken positive steps, but we all know that unfortunately it is not enough, and we cannot stop here,"" he said. Out of 140,000 weapons Mexican authorities have seized since Calderon declared a crackdown on cartels at the beginning of his presidency, 84,000 were high-powered assault weapons, Calderon said. More than 47,000 people have been killed in drug-related violence in Mexico since December 2006, according to government statistics. During his Thursday speech, Calderon looked toward the border and said he had a message for Americans. ""We need your help to stop this violence. We need you to reduce your consumption of drugs and to dramatically reduce the flow of money to criminal organizations in Mexico,"" he said. ""But beyond the topic of drugs, the best way that you, the American people, can help reduce the violence in Mexico is through legislation that has already been in force in the United States, blocking the inhumane weapons trafficking into our country."" CNN's Rey Rodriguez, Eduardo Aragon and Ariel Crespo contributed to this report.","Calderon says criminals have ""unlimited access to high-powered weapons""

"(CNN) -- The family of American student Amanda Knox is happy that new DNA analysis has called into question her murder conviction, but won't celebrate ""until she walks out of that prison,"" her mother said Thursday. In an interview with CNN's ""Newsroom,"" Edda Mellas said her daughter is ""not taking anything for granted."" But a priest who was visiting Knox reported the results were met with ""jumping and hugging"" on Wednesday. ""There are many people that support her,"" Mellas said. ""He said he could finally see the light back in her eyes, and she looked like she could finally breathe after three and a half years."" Knox and her ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were found guilty in the 2007 killing of Knox's roommate, Meredith Kercher. Kercher was found dead in the villa she rented with Knox in the central Italian university town of Perugia, semi-naked and with her throat slashed. In December, Knox was sentenced to 26 years in prison. But Wednesday, forensic experts told an Italian court that the DNA evidence police used to link Knox to the murder weapon may have been tainted. The next hearing in her appeal is scheduled for July 25, with further hearings on July 30 and August 1. Mellas said a decision on the appeal could come in late September. She said her daughter was ""a naive, idealistic, easygoing 20-year-old"" when she was arrested, but has ""gone into her own little shell"" while in jail. ""She's definitely grown up,"" Mellas said. ""She's had to learn how to survive and take care of herself. She has become much more closed in that environment in order to kind of survive."" At the trial, prosecutors said a knife found in Sollecito's home had traces of Knox's genetic material on the handle and Kercher's in a tiny groove on the blade. Investigators also traced DNA on Kercher's bra to Sollecito. But in a 146-page report, forensic science professors Carla Vecchiotti and Stefano Conti concluded that while Knox's DNA was present on the knife handle, tests for Kercher's DNA were unreliable. ""There is no conclusive scientific evidence regarding the nature of the blood,"" the their report states. It added, ""It cannot be excluded that the result obtained from sampling the find B (knife blade) could be the result of contamination"" occurring at any stage of the testing process. Investigators did not follow ""international inspection procedures and protocols for gathering and presenting evidence"" in testing either the knife or the bra fastening,"" they found. Prosecutors say the knife had been used to stab Kercher in the neck and that it had been cleaned. The DNA matter attributed to Kercher consists of flesh, not blood, they say. But the sample was so small that forensic scientists investigating Kercher's slaying were unable to double-test it in accordance with international forensic science norms, which Knox's legal team says raises doubts about its validity. Defense lawyers also say the tiny metal clasp from Kercher's bra, which was cut from her body after her murder, may have been contaminated because it was not collected as evidence until nearly six weeks later. In an appeal hearing Monday, Knox took to the stand herself following testimony from a third person convicted in the case, Rudy Guede. It was the first time the three defendants had appeared in court together since a preliminary hearing years ago. Guede, who was found guilty of murder in a separate fast-track trial and sentenced to 16 years, refused to say Knox was not involved in the killing. A prosecutor then read out a letter sent by Guede in 2010 in which he said he thought the American and her then-boyfriend had killed Kercher. An emotional Knox responded, saying: ""The only time that Rudy Guede, Raffaele Sollecito and I were in one room together was in a court room.... He knows what the truth is. I don't know what happened that night."" Journalist Livia Borghese contributed to this report.","A favorable DNA report was met with ""jumping and hugging,"" Knox's mother says .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- The victim of a vicious beating by a gang of men shouting anti-gay slurs said Wednesday that he wants his attackers to face justice. Brandon White, 20, spoke out for the first time at a news conference in Atlanta. He said he should never have to worry about being assaulted just because he is a gay man. ""If a straight person can walk to the store, I should be able to do the same thing,"" he said. ""I could have died that day. They are monsters."" A video circulated online shows three men punching and kicking White after he stepped out of the JVC Grocery and Deli in southwest Atlanta's Pittsburgh neighborhood. The men, believed to be members of a gang called Jack City, yelled: ""No f----ts in Jack City."" The store's surveillance video shows White, dressed in a purple shirt and black jeans with a cell phone to his left ear, exit the store along with another man. As soon as they step outside, White is accosted by his attackers. The surveillance video captured eight men standing around watching, two of them with video cameras in hand. One man lunges at White with a tire in his hands. White told HLN later Wednesday that he went home after the 30-second attack. ""At this point I am beyond mad,"" he told Jane Velez-Mitchell. ""I actually go back because I wanted to see who they were."" Atlanta police said the incident occurred February 4. White said he did not report it right away because he did not want to draw attention to himself. He could not even bring himself to watch the video at first, he was so humiliated and embarrassed. The video was released on YouTube and WorldHipHop.com, and was posted on The Smoking Gun. When it went viral, White decided to talk to the police. ""Once they put it out there they set themselves up,"" he told HLN. ""I feel I was violated,"" White told reporters. ""The scars run deeper than anyone will know. The physical pain, I can get over that. My thing is: Who's to say they won't come after me again? Who's to say they won't kill me?"" Mayor Kasim Reed has doubled to $10,000 a reward for information leading to the arrest of suspects, said his spokesman, Reese McCranie. FBI agents are also investigating the case to determine whether it meets criteria for prosecution under the federal hate crimes statute. White told HLN he could not comment on that aspect of the investigation. U.S. Attorney Sally Quillian Yates said her office is looking into potential civil rights violations based on sexual orientation. Georgia does not have a state hate crimes statute. ""The actions depicted in the video are appalling and unacceptable in our community, and we encourage anyone with information about this video to contact the FBI or Atlanta police,"" Yates said. Enraged gay rights activists vowed that justice would be served, and residents appealed for expanded police presence in their community. Devon Barrington Ward of Change Atlanta said the Jack City gang has no place in the Pittsburgh neighborhood. ""When I realized this was taking place in my own backyard, it was a gut-wrenching feeling,"" Ward said at Wednesday's news conference. ""My brother was assaulted, so that means I was assaulted."" Ward said tougher laws are needed to make victims like White feel empowered to come forward. White's attackers, Ward said, are ""cowards"" who will be caught. Pittsburgh community residents said the corner where White was attacked has been the scene of other acts of violence. They called for the JVC store to be shut down. ""Pittsburgh is not Jack City,"" said LaShawn M. Hoffman, head of the Pittsburgh Community Improvement Association. He said he is alarmed by the fact that no one on that corner thought to call police while White was being beaten. ""This is not the norm for our neighborhood,"" he said. Last year, the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs released a study that showed that hate crimes committed against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) and HIV-affected people were on the rise in America. In 2010, the coalition reported a 13% rise in LGBT hate crimes and documented 27 murders, a 23% increase from 2009. State Rep. Simone Bell, who is openly gay, told CNN Atlanta affiliate WSB she hopes this case will pave the way for hate-crime legislation in Georgia.

"(CNN) -- Last July, the world celebrated the birth of its newest nation as South Sudan officially separated from the north. It was hoped then that after decades of bloodshed, the people of of both nations would finally know peace. But just a few months later, refugee camps are filling to the brim as fighting in the border states of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile has intensified and displaced more than 400,000 people. They arrive at the camps in trucks, on camels and even by foot, said Jean-Pierre Amigo, a field coordinator with Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF) or Doctors Without Borders. ""The number of people is increasing every day,"" Amigo said. Fighting erupted between Sudan's army and South Sudan rebels in Southern Kordofan even before independence was formalized. The violence spread to Blue Nile in September. The Enough Project, which works to expose genocide and crimes against humanity, recently documented killings and rape by Sudanese forces in Blue Nile. ""The civilian toll from an indiscriminate aerial bombardment campaign is rising,"" said a field dispatch from the Enough Project. The United Nations has appealed for money to help civilians caught in the violence. ""We are looking at a deteriorating humanitarian situation in the areas out of which the refugees in neighboring South Sudan and Ethiopia have fled,"" Peter de Clercq, the United Nations' acting humanitarian coordinator in Sudan, said this month. That in addition to the crisis in the Darfur region -- where war broke out in 2003 and 3.75 million people still need help -- qualifies Sudan as one of the world's largest humanitarian crises, according to the United Nations. The world body is asking for $1.06 billion to help 4.2 million people in 2012. Amigo of MSF is witnessing firsthand the human suffering caused by protracted conflict. The medical charity has ratcheted up efforts in the area to deal with a full-scale emergency. Amigo said among the new arrivals at Alfuj refugee camp was a 70-year-old woman who was brought in a donkey cart. She had traveled days with six bullet wounds in her back. Half of one her hands was gone. Many of the people seeking refuge at Alfuj are suffering from respiratory disease, malaria and malnutrition, Amigo said. They told MSF they had been on the move since September, at first hiding in wooded areas near their crops but eventually fleeing their homes altogether. At Alfuj, mothers are delivering babies under trees, Amigo said. MSF has set up a 24-hour maternity ward. No one here has a mosquito net. They share drinking holes with cattle. Or women and girls wait for up to 12 hours to fill a plastic can from a water pump. MSF installed a massive water bladder to bring some relief. MSF has also been feeding children high-nutrition biscuits. Without any other aid agency at Alfuj, it has been difficult for the MSF staff, Amigo said. ""As a medical organization, we cannot help everyone there,"" Amigo said. ""We cannot meet all the needs."" Earlier this month, the United Nations refugee agency airlifted relief supplies from neighboring Kenya. The C-130 Hercules transport planes carried plastic sheets and rolls, sleeping mats, blankets, mosquito nets, buckets, jerry cans and kitchen sets. ""These supplies are desperately needed,"" said Vivian Tan, spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in the South Sudan capital, Juba. ""Families often arrive here exhausted, hungry, cold or sick. We have already distributed whatever we had on the ground, including aid from Juba and Malakal. Our local warehouse is almost empty now."" But few of those supplies have reached Alfuj, where access is difficult because of bad road conditions. South Sudan is independent now, Amigo said, but not free from crisis. The MSF staff saw 400 malnourished children in one day at Alfuj. There is no doubt in Amigo's mind that they were addressing an acute emergency.","Fighting in two border states has intensified and displaced thousands .
Many are arriving at refugee camps where malnutrition and disease are rampant .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- A Tibetan protester set himself alight in New Delhi on Monday ahead of Chinese President Hu Jintao's visit to India this week, police said. New Delhi police spokesman Rajan Bhagat said the 27-year-old man was part of a Tibetan protest over Hu's upcoming visit to the Indian capital for a summit Thursday. The man was hospitalized with burns on 90% of his body, Bhagat said. Self-immolation is a common form of protests for Tibetans who want genuine autonomy from China and accuse Beijing of repression. More than 30 of them took place in the last year in China, Tibetan advocacy groups say. They follow an increase in security measures by the Chinese authorities in response to unrest among Tibetans in western areas of China in recent months. Some in Tibet have advocated independence from China. But the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, and others have said they favor genuine autonomy and resent the slow erosion of their culture amid an influx of Han Chinese, the most numerous ethnic group in China. Activists say the disturbing acts of self-immolation reflect an increasingly repressive environment under China's control. Beijing rejects accusations of oppression of Tibetans, saying that under its rule, living standards have greatly improved for the Tibetan people. Chinese officials have described the self-immolations as ""extreme"" acts.","The protester had burns on 90% of his body, police say .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Yemen's new president on Saturday promised to continue the fight against al Qaeda, calling it ""a religious and national duty"" for citizens of his restive nation. Abdurabu Mansur Hadi was sworn in Saturday in the capital, Sanaa. The ceremony cements a power transfer deal reached in November to end months of protests and violence over outgoing leader Ali Abdullah Saleh's longtime rule. Hadi -- who served as Saleh's vice president and became acting president in November in an agreement brokered by the Gulf Cooperation Council -- was sworn in before Yemen's parliament. President Barack Obama called Hadi to congratulate him and to say that the United States ""will stand with the people of Yemen as they continue their efforts to forge a brighter future for their country,"" according to a White House statement. ""Under President Hadi's leadership, Yemen has the potential to serve as a model for how peaceful transitions can occur when people resist violence and unite under a common cause,"" Obama said, warning that much work still lies ahead. Before Hadi took power, the Yemeni government had been engulfed in anti-Saleh protests and for years has been fighting al Qaeda militants. And as Hadi was being sworn in, a deadly car bomb killed more than 20 security force members in another part of the nation. The explosion occurred in Hadramout province, near the presidential palace in Mukalla, the provincial seat, a senior security official and an eyewitness said. The Mukalla palace is one of several presidential palaces throughout the country. Hadramout province is in the country's east; Sanaa is in the west. ""Yemen is a country where such attacks take place, so this is not a surprise,"" said Ali Saeed Obaid, a government official. No one has yet claimed responsibility. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is one of al Qaeda's strongest branches. Speaking about the fight against al Qaeda, Hadi said he hoped an effort to eradicate militants would lead to the return of displaced persons to their towns and villages. ""The country does not need additional crises to deepen its wounds, as the next period requires serious dialogue and clear outlines through a new constitution that meets the national expectations,"" Hadi said. He talked about the importance of reviving the middle class. ""We have to employ our energies in all walks of life and make security a reality that is felt by the citizen."" On Monday, a formal inauguration will take place in Sanaa -- one that Saleh is expected to attend. A spokesman for the country's embassy in Washington said late Friday that Saleh had returned home after a short U.S. visit for medical treatment. ""The inauguration on Monday will only be ceremonial and a celebration in support for Yemen's new leader,"" said Abdul Aziz Jubari, a member of Yemen's parliament from Saleh's General People's Congress party. Hadi received 99.8% of the 6.6 million votes cast in Tuesday's election, according to Mohmmad Hassan al-Hakimi, chairman of the Supreme Committee for Elections and Referendum. Saleh, who led Yemen for 33 years, was wounded in a June assassination attempt at his presidential palace during battles between government troops and tribal fighters. A ""massive celebration"" was being planned for Saleh, who will not necessarily disappear from Yemeni politics, said Abdu Ganadi, his senior aide. ""Saleh has the option to continue involvement in politics, and the power transfer deal will not force him to step aside,"" Ganadi said. ""He is the leader of the GPC, and his voice and support will continue being heard in the GPC."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the Yemeni election ""another important step forward in their democratic transition process."" Gerald Feierstein, U.S. ambassador to Yemen, said it was a great day for the country. ""I think a lot of credit goes to the Yemeni people and to the Yemenis political leadership for guiding this country successfully through some difficult challenges so far,"" he said. ""This is just the beginning of the real transition process which is going to play out over the next couple of years. U.N. envoy to Yemen Jamal bin Omar said the Arab nation ""is turning the page."" He said an upcoming ""national dialogue conference"" will be an ""opportunity to draft a new constitution that will be a new social pact among the Yemenis."" Human Rights Watch has called on Hadi to make changes without delay. ""Yemen's potentially historic transition will be off to a shaky start unless Hadi makes an immediate break with the abuses of the past,"" said Letta Tayler, the rights group's Yemen researcher. ""Yemen's new leader needs to move decisively to usher in promised reforms that uphold human rights and the rule of law."" The 65-year-old Hadi is a British-, Egyptian- and Soviet-trained army officer, recently promoted to field marshal. He had been vice president since 1994 and ran for a two-year term as president on pledges of improving security and creating jobs. But he's never had much of a power base, and Yemen's problems are expected to take longer than two years to fix. Yemen is the poorest country in the Middle East, with a severe shortage of water and rising levels of malnutrition among its population of about 25 million. Saleh faced a separatist movement in the south, sectarian tensions in the north and the growing presence of what Western officials describe as al Qaeda's most dangerous affiliate, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. CNN's Jamie Crawford and Kindah Shair contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama: Yemen could ""serve as a model for how peaceful transitions can occur""

"(CNN) -- A man filmed a group of girls attacking a 12-year-old girl in his neighbor's garden, and told Providence, Rhode Island, police he thought it was a prank. Two of the girls have been charged with assault with a deadly weapon and conspiracy, and two others have been charged with simple assault and conspiracy, said Providence Police Sgt. Matthew Ryan. The 12-year-old suffered two black eyes, a bruised nose and bite marks on her hands. Holly Gingerella, the girl's mother, said, ""My daughter is doing OK. She doesn't look very good, but she's a strong child."" She said her daughter has a shunt in her brain to aid with a medical problem, but the shunt was not damaged in the assault. The man posted the video of the incident on YouTube, where he shows his face to the camera and describes the attack, ""Kids are (expletive) sitting outside for like 20 minutes saying, 'Don't do this, don't do that. You gotta keep going, you gotta keep fighting.' They're like planning it so they can just record it."" While he speaks, girls can be heard shouting in the background. Ryan said additional cell phone video of the attack was turned in to police after it was confiscated at Woonsocket Middle School. The principal's office was closed when CNN tried to contact the school. Ryan said the man is not being charged and is not involved in the case now that the video is no longer in his possession. Gingerella said she was ""horrified"" the man didn't try to stop her daughter's attack. Gingerella said the leader of the girls invited her daughter to spend Friday night at her house and that all was normal between the girls. She said there had been no major incidents between them besides what she said were the usual ups and downs of a young school friendship. Gingerella described her daughter as someone who ""is very quiet. She likes to stay to herself. She tries to get people to like her."" On Saturday afternoon, Gingerella said, the situation changed. ""My daughter said everything turned bad in about 10 minutes. She was attacked and they wouldn't stop. She got up and ran. Then they attacked her on the pavement. Nobody interfered. Not even the man who videoed it."" Gingerella said the other girls posed as her daughter via text message, quickly canceling a request from her daughter to be picked up with a message saying, ""Can I please stay the night?"" After the incident, Gingerella's daughter started to walk home before being picked up by one of her friends, who she begged not to tell her mother about the incident because she was afraid of retribution, Gingerella said. When the girl got home, Gingerella said her daughter told her she was hit by a softball, but then began crying and explained what happened. Gingerella said there were no parents in the house at the time of the incident. The mother of the girl accused of leading the attack spoke to CNN affiliate WJAR and said, ""I love my daughter, too. But my daughter needs help. My daughter has done this too many times. She needs to be punished for this."" Ryan said two of the girls had been turned in by their parents to police and charged as minors, while the other two are expected to be turned in soon. Parents of the other girls were not available for comment.","Four Rhode Island girls accused of attacking school friend .

"Washington (CNN) -- Tests on the ruptured BP well in the Gulf of Mexico will go on for another 24 hours as federal and company officials try to explain ""anomalous"" pressure readings and possible leaks, the federal government's point man on the spill said Monday. ""There is no indication at this time this is any indication of a significant problem in the well bore, but we are running every one of these anomalies down,"" former Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen told reporters Monday afternoon. The pressures recorded on the well in the four days since it was temporarily ""shut in"" are lower than expected, Allen said. Meanwhile, there are possible leaks of methane gas from around the well and from the inoperative blowout preventer, as well as a separate and possibly unrelated seep from the ocean floor about 3 kilometers (about 2 miles) away, he said. Allen said scientists and engineers are still debating whether the low pressure is caused by either the well's depletion after three months of oil spewing into the Gulf or whether oil is leaking from the well into the surrounding sea floor. ""There are arguments to be made on both sides,"" he said. ""But those discussions continue, and we're trying to develop information that will allow us to do that."" He said a joint in the capping stack placed over the damaged well appeared to be leaking a combination of oil and methane, but there appeared to be no sign that it was hindering the equipment now being used to contain the worst oil spill in U.S. history. Some seepage from the ocean floor is normal in the Gulf of Mexico, according to University of Houston professor Don Van Nieuwenhuise. But he said there are weak points in the well bore, and it's ""very hard to tell the difference"" between a depleted well and a leaking well. ""If there is a leak, you should be able to see the oil and gas infiltrating into a rock unit at about that level, and they have not seen that,"" he said. Allen had extended testing Sunday as well, pointing out ""a number of unanswered questions"" about the monitoring systems being used to conduct the tests. Earlier Monday, he said the tests would continue only if BP was ""rigorously"" watching for any signs that the pressure tests could make the situation worse. Engineers and scientists have intensified monitoring of the well, poring over images and data collected by robots, sonar scans, and seismic and acoustic examinations. A government ship is in the area, fitted with equipment for detecting methane gas, which would be an indication of a leak. ""At any moment, we have the ability to return to the safe containment of the oil on the surface until the time the relief well is completed and the well is permanently killed,"" Allen said. In the coming weeks, BP also plans to bring in two more oil collection ships in addition to the two in the Gulf, bringing containment capacity to 80,000 barrels (about 3.4 million gallons) of oil a day, more than high-end estimates of how much oil had been leaking. Coast Guard Rear Adm. Paul Zukunft, Allen's deputy on the scene, said the Helix Producer and the Q4000, two of the ships disconnected from the well to put on the containment cap, could be quickly re-connected within hours if scientists decide that's necessary. In addition, BP also plans to conduct tests known as ranging runs on one of its relief wells, which company officials have said could intersect the ruptured well by the end of July and provide the permanent solution to the leak. BP then plans to pump mud and cement down to kill the ruptured well. Pressure continues to rise steadily at about 1 pound PSI per hour and was about 6,811 pounds Monday evening, BP Senior Vice President Kent Wells told reporters. Wells said gas bubbles reported coming from the well casing could be nitrogen used in the well's cementing process, but others near the well head contained about 15 percent methane. A breach in the casing would be signaled by a drop in pressure or possibly the release of methane gas, which is sometimes a precursor to oil rising through the formation, he said. Continuing with the testing is ""absolutely the best way for us to go forward,"" Wells said. The well, located about 5,000 feet below the surface of the Gulf and about 40 miles off the mouth of the Mississippi River, erupted April 20 with the sinking of the offshore drilling rig Deepwater Horizon. No oil has gushed out since Thursday, when BP closed all the valves in a new custom-made cap that was lowered into place earlier in the week. That lull in oil flow has jump-started the federal claims process. Kenneth Feinberg, the man in charge of disbursing the $20 billion in funds BP is setting aside to resolve Gulf oil spill-related claims, said Monday that now that the oil leak has apparently been stopped, it will be a lot easier and quicker to get a handle on the universal claims. At a question-and-answer discussion in Washington, Feinberg said it has been difficult to come up with a budget because officials did not know how pervasive the spill would become. ""Now that the oil has stopped, with my fingers crossed, we will quickly come up with an overall budget,"" he said. Feinberg said the fund was being established by BP with the support of the Obama administration as an alternative to years of protracted litigation, and said the challenge is to make the reparations process attractive enough so people will voluntarily seek compensation from it.

"(CNN) -- The University of Kansas men's basketball team squeaked by Ohio State late Saturday night, setting up an an NCAA tournament championship showdown with top-seeded Kentucky. Hours earlier, Kentucky defeated Louisville in its own semifinal. The Wildcats and the Jayhawks will play Monday night for the title at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans. Both teams squared off earlier in the year with Kentucky pulling off a 75-65 win. Under coach John Calipari, Kentucky posted a 32-2 record over the course of this season -- with its only losses coming at the hands of Indiana and Vanderbilt, the latter coming in the Southeastern Conference tourney. It entered the 68-team NCAA tournament as the No. 1 seed in the South bracket, and the favorite to win it all in the eyes of many pundits. The team was led by Anthony Davis, a freshman who was recently named the Associated Press college basketball player of the year. But a win in Saturday's contest against Kentucky's in-state rival, Louisville, was hardly a given. The Cardinals, for one, had a head coach with a national title to his credits -- Rick Pitino, who ironically won that distinction in 1996 as head coach at Kentucky. Louisville entered the NCAAs with momentum after winning the Big East Tournament. The Cardinals battled the Wildcats tough throughout Saturday's game, tying the score, 49-49, at one point early in the second half. But the Wildcats eventually pulled away, winning by a 69-61 margin. Ohio State and Kansas entered the night's second tilt as No. 2 seeds, having both defeated the top seeds in their brackets -- Syracuse and North Carolina, respectively -- in the Elite Eight. The Jayhawks were paced by forward Thomas Robinson, this season's lone unanimous AP All-American pick. On the other side of the court was the Buckeyes' Jared Sullinger, who himself earned first-team honors for the second straight year. On Saturday night, Ohio State jumped ahead early, carrying a 34-25 advantage into the half. But Kansas stormed back after the intermission, notching the game up at 38-38 with 14 minutes left in the game. The rest of the game was nip-and-tuck, with rarely more than a few points separating the two teams and several lead changes in the final minutes. Kansas edged ahead with just over a minute to go and held on, thanks to some pivotal free throws and an Ohio State lane violation call, for a 64-62 victory.","Kansas narrowly defeats Ohio State, 64-62, to advance to the NCAA finals .

"(CNN) -- U.S. authorities overreacted in shutting down the online file-sharing site Megaupload and seeking criminal charges against its executives, the company's American lawyer said Friday. ""We believe that the allegations are without merit and Megaupload is going to vigorously defend against the case,"" attorney Ira Rothken said. Federal authorities shut the site down Thursday, the same day they announced indictments against seven people connected to the site, accusing them of operating an ""international organized criminal enterprise responsible for massive worldwide online piracy of copyrighted works."" Four of those charged were arrested Friday in New Zealand at the request of U.S. authorities. The site, which traffic-tracking service Alexa ranked as the world's 72nd most visited website before it was taken down, allowed users to share and download files, many of which were copyrighted works made available for download without permission, according to authorities. Rothken said the case demonstrates a ""copyright extremist mentality"" on the part of U.S. authorities and raises significant due process and consumer protection issues. He said it was inappropriate for U.S. authorities to seize the company's servers and domain names, not to mention $50 million in assets, without a court hearing. He also said the seizure means consumers who had stored legitimately acquired materials on sites owned by Megaupload can no longer access them. The seizure ""has essentially created a chilling effect on consumers using Internet cloud storage going forward,"" Rothken said. Federal prosecutors allege Megaupload's founders ""conducted their illegal operation using a business model expressly designed to promote uploading of the most popular copyrighted works."" The site's popular MegaVideo subsidiary was widely known in tech circles for its copious selection of pirated content, including recent movies and episodes of hit TV shows. ""The conspirators allegedly paid users whom they specifically knew uploaded infringing content and publicized their links to users throughout the world,"" prosecutors said in a statement. They also took steps to mask the presence of illegal content on the site, prosecutors said. The company also discouraged users from using the site for legitimate personal storage by automatically deleting files that weren't regularly downloaded, prosecutors said. Authorities said the operation had generated more than $175 million in illegal profits through advertising revenue and the sale of premium memberships. Those indicted are citizens of New Zealand, Germany, Slovakia and the Netherlands. No U.S. citizens were named. However, Megaupload has servers in Ashburn, Virginia, and Washington, which prompted the Virginia-based investigation. The investigation involved 20 search warrants in eight countries, authorities said. Officials seized 18 domain names from the company and its servers based in the United States, the Netherlands and Canada. Megaupload's sudden shutdown Thursday got the attention of hackers, who quickly assembled a widespread operation to take down the Justice Department and FBI websites, as well as those for the Motion Picture Association of America, the Recording Industry Association of America and several other sites. The Internet activism and hacking collective Anonymous took credit for the denial-of-service attacks, which don't damage computer systems but keep sites from operating properly by overloading them with spurious requests. That can slow a site down or keep its servers from responding to legitimate requests. ""It's a violation of freedom of speech,"" one Anonymous member told CNN of the Megaupload shutdown. ""It's part of a bigger picture that's taking place ... which is a very big slide toward Internet censorship on a gigantic scale."" Most of the sites were back up by Friday morning, but the website for New Zealand police, which Anonymous also targeted, appeared to be down early Saturday. The Justice Department and FBI sites targeted Thursday were operating normally on Friday, a law enforcement official told CNN. Investigators are ""looking at forensics to see where (the attack) came from,"" the official said. No data breaches occurred on U.S. government sites, the law enforcement official told CNN. The four Megaupload officials arrested in New Zealand -- Kim Dotcom, Finn Batato, Mathias Ortmann and Bram van der Kolk -- appeared Friday at an initial court hearing. Dotcom, the Megaupload founder and owner, spoke briefly, interrupting an attorney who sought to stop reporters from photographing the men, according to the New Zealand Herald newspaper. ""We don't mind ... if people want to take photographs of us or cover this event because we've got nothing to hide,"" the newspaper quoted him as saying. It was unclear when extradition proceedings would begin. The four were arrested after a complicated raid that involved 76 police officers who arrived at a New Zealand mansion by helicopter and had to repeatedly defeat electronic locks in pursuing Dotcom, New Zealand's TV One reported, citing Detective Inspector Grant Wormald. Officers had to cut their way into a safe room, where they found Dotcom near a sawed-off shotgun, the broadcaster reported. ""It was definitely not as simple as knocking at the front door,"" TV One quoted Wormald as saying. The raid, seizure and shutdown comes in the same week as a widespread Internet protest over controversial anti-piracy bills in the U.S. House and Senate that would make it easier for U.S. authorities to target foreign piracy sites, of which prosecutors allege Megaupload was one. The bills are known as the Stop Online Piracy Act, or SOPA, and the Protect Intellectual Property Act, or PIPA. The bills are aimed at cracking down on copyright infringement by restricting access to sites that host or facilitate the trading of pirated content. But the legislation has created a divide between tech giants, who say the language is too broad, and large media companies, who say they are losing millions each year to rampant online piracy. Time Warner, the parent company of CNN, is among the industry supporters of the legislation. On Friday, after numerous legislators pulled their support for the legislation in the wake of the protests, House and Senate leaders announced they would delay action on the legislation to address concerns raised by activists. Rothken said the shutdown calls into question whether legislation like SOPA or PIPA is truly needed. ""This demonstrates the government is certainly able to act without any additional legislation,"" he said. CNN's Laurie Segall, Terry Frieden, Amber Lyon, Steve Turnham, Carol Cratty and David Goldman contributed to this report .","File-sharing firm's attorney says U.S. authorities overreached in shutting company down .

"(CNN) -- Ivory Coast's star-studded team beat Burkina Faso 2-0 Thursday to seal qualification to the quarterfinals of the Africa Cup of Nations. Salomon Kalou put the Ivory Coast ahead in the first half and victory was sealed as Bakary Kone headed an own goal in the final minutes of the Group B clash in the Estado Neuvo de Malabo in Equatorial Guinea. Ivory Coast beat Sudan 1-0 in their opening match and look set to qualify as group winners. Earlier, Sudan and Angola shared four goals in their Group B match at the same stadium. It leaves Angola in second place in the section and in a strong position to go through with Ivory Coast who they meet Monday. Chelsea's Kalou thumped home his shot in the 16th minute after a cross by his club teammate Didier Drogba . Burkina Faso pressed at the start of the second half, but it was Arsenal's Gervinho who had the best chance for the Ivory Coast from close range. Kalou pulled up injured and was substituted before his side survived a real scare as Burkina Faso striker Moumouni Dagano outjumped Souleymane Bamba only to see his header hit the woodwork. Kone's looping 82nd minute back header sealed his side's fate as it flew over his goalkeeper Daouda Diakite. With two defeats in two games they are going home. In the earlier match, Sudan ended a 36-year Africa Cup of Nations goal drought, but they had to come from behind twice to draw with Angola. Mohamed Bashir twice leveled for Sudan with former Manchester United striker Manucho grabbing Angola's goals.","Ivory Coast beat Burkina Faso 2-0 to record second Group B win .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Another teacher has been arrested at Miramonte Elementary School in Los Angeles on allegations of lewd acts on young pupils, authorities said Friday. Capt. Mike Parker of the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said that Friday's arrest is ""quite different"" from the arrest earlier this week of another teacher, Mark Berndt. Berndt, 61, was accused of taking bondage photos of more than two dozen students in his classroom, some showing suspected semen-filled spoons at the children's mouths, authorities said. Investigators from the special victims bureau arrested the second teacher, Martin Bernard Springer, 49, of Alhambra, California, on Friday, Parker told reporters. Springer's arrest came after investigators received ""new information"" on Thursday morning that led them to the teacher. Authorities say that the allegations involved two young girls ""who were allegedly fondled in the classroom"" by the suspect, Parker said. The girls were about 7 at the time of the alleged offenses, which occurred ""during the past three years,"" Parker said. Springer's bail has been set at $2 million, according to Parker. Los Angeles County prosecutors are reviewing whether to file charges against Springer, a spokeswoman said Friday. ""We'll see have to see how far the evidence goes in the latest arrest,"" spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons told reporters. Aside from the two teachers being assigned to the same Los Angeles school, ""I'm not aware of any connection"" between them, Parker said. Parker said he didn't know whether the two teachers allegedly committed offenses against the same pupils. Berndt, a 30-year teaching veteran, is being held on $23 million bail: $1 million for each of the 23 counts he faces of lewd acts on a child. Berndt's attorney is a public defender, but Los Angeles County Chief Deputy Public Defender Stanley Shimotsu was not immediately available for a comment Friday. On Friday, about 15 angry parents gathered outside the school, complaining that administrators failed to apprise them of the investigation into the second teacher. One mother, Isadora Arrellano, told CNN that she will transfer her 5-year-old deaf son to another school at the end of the academic year. ""Right now I'm really worried for my kid,"" Arrellano told CNN. ""I leave my son and I go home and I don't know what's going to happen to him,"" she added. ""He's deaf, so he cannot speak, so that's why I'm worried. I've lost all trust in this school."" Another mother, who identified herself by her middle name of Gloria, told CNN that Berndt tried to force her daughter to eat a cookie with ""something white"" on it. Berndt also took a photo of the girl with the cookie next to her mouth, the mother said. ""I'm worried something could have happened to my daughter because of something he gave her,"" the mother said. Berndt assigned his pupils to bring cockroaches and insects to class, the mother said. The investigation into Berndt began in October 2010, when a CVS drugstore photo technician in the South Bay area of Los Angeles County told the Redondo Police Department about finding disturbing images of blindfolded children in a processing order, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Dan Scott. The case was turned over to the sheriff's office, and after an initial investigation, investigators notified school authorities, who removed Berndt from his classroom in January 2011. About 400 photographs collected by investigators show children blindfolded, with tape over their mouths, Scott said. At least 23 children in the images have been identified, while another 10 are unidentified, he said. Some photos show female students with ""what appeared to be a blue plastic spoon, filled with an unknown clear/white liquid substance, up to their mouths as if they were going to ingest the substance,"" authorities said. Scott said a search of Berndt's classroom included a blue spoon like the one in the pictures. The spoon and small container recovered from the classroom were sent to a criminal laboratory for DNA testing. It took seven months for investigators to identify the sample as semen, Scott said, and authorities got a sample of Berndt's DNA. He declined to reveal how. ""It took us another six to seven months to process Berndt's DNA and match it with the classroom DNA sample that tested positive for semen,"" he said. Processing the DNA, identifying the children in the photos and conducting in-depth interviews with potential victims was time-consuming, Scott said in response to criticism over the year that passed before Berndt was arrested. ""We always had our eyes on him, and there was never a chance he would get away from us,"" Scott said. The young students ""didn't realize they were victimized,"" Scott said. ""They thought they were being blindfolded and gagged as a game."" Berndt's public defender has not spoken to reporters about the case, which is set for arraignment on February 21. CNN's Tom Larson, Stella Chan, Alan Duke and Stan Wilson contributed to this story.","NEW: Angry parents gather outside school; one mom plans to transfer deaf son .

"(CNN) -- Egypt's presidential race has been a political roller coaster. After banning 10 candidates earlier this month, the country's election commission banned and unbanned this week yet another well-known candidate, former Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq, although the constitutional court is still reviewing that decision. The remaining front-runners for president speak a similar language on the need for economic reform and political transition, but they hold very different positions on the role of Islam in a new Egypt. In this sense, the presidential election will be an important indicator of how much weight Egyptians give to Islam as a factor in their political life. It will not be the only factor in their decision, which will no doubt turn on questions of personality and name recognition as much as anything. But a vote for a candidate with more conservative Islamist leanings -- and there is evidence of strong support for such candidates -- will likely influence the writing of the constitution, with potential for a long-lasting impact on the rights of minorities and women in particular. With only a month until the vote, and with the slate of potential candidates in such flux, it is not surprising that concerns are growing about the credibility and fairness of the elections. The recent disqualifications of former intelligence chief Omar Suleiman, Salafist preacher Hazem Salah Abu Ismail, and the Muslim Brotherhood's Khairat el Shater have fueled charges that Egypt's military rulers are trying to manipulate the election from behind the scenes to deliver a candidate suitable to their interests. According to the latest Al Ahram poll, conducted after the disqualification of Suleiman, Abu Ismail, and el-Shater, the front-runner now is clearly Amr Moussa, with support among voters of roughly 40%. Moussa is very likely the military's choice at this point. A former diplomat who served as secretary general of the Arab League, he is an establishment figure who has vowed to give the military a voice in key policy decisions through a national security council that would include top military officers. Moussa's election, however, is far from a done deal. The big swing factor is the Islamist vote. Moussa, a secularist, has said that Egypt cannot afford an ""experiment"" in Islamic democracy at this time. Yet more than 70% of voters in the parliamentary election last fall opted for Islamist candidates. With the rejection of el-Shater, the Muslim Brotherhood candidate is now Mohamed Morsi, 60, who represents the older, more conservative wing of the Brotherhood and openly endorses a strict Islamic vision, which will appeal to the Salafist vote. Morsi has called for a council of Islamic scholars to review whether state laws are in accordance with Sharia law, although he has said the council's decisions need not be binding. El-Shater, in contrast, stuck to a pragmatic, economic-oriented message and stressed his support for tolerance and democracy. Voters will likely find the Brotherhood's claims of support for pluralism less plausible under Morsi's banner. But the Brotherhood has strongly thrown its weight behind Morsi, telling its broad base of followers that they must vote for him, and many will do so. The other leading Islamist is Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh, a charismatic doctor who rose to national attention in 1977 when he publicly chastised former President Anwar el-Sadat at a public forum at Cairo University. Aboul Fotouh, popular among the younger generation of Muslim Brotherhood members, has over the years become increasingly critical of the Brotherhood's conservative stances. When the party published a platform in 2007, drafted by Mohamed Morsi, Aboul Fotouh spoke out against controversial provisions excluding non-Muslims and women from the presidency. In 2009, Aboul Fotouh was purged from his leadership position in the Brotherhood. He was kicked out of the party last year when he declared his candidacy for president. Although Aboul Fotouh remains an Islamist, on the stump he focuses on justice and pragmatic economic issues and appears dismissive of talk of Islamic law. Despite all the political turmoil, it seems likely that Egypt's election will go forward next month, and voters will be faced with relatively clear choices. While it is possible that Islamist voters will throw their weight behind Amr Moussa, perhaps out of name recognition or in hopes of a return to stability, others will inevitably lean toward an Islamist candidate. A vote for Mohamed Morsi will consolidate the Brotherhood's political influence, which could translate into a constitution with weaker provisions for protection of minority and women's rights. If Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh emerges as the winner, it will be a sign that Egyptians are interested in a more pluralistic agenda within an Islamic framework. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Isobel Coleman.","Isobel Coleman says Egyptian vote a roller coaster; unclear how big a role Islam will play .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Opening arguments started Monday in the first case in which a Roman Catholic archdiocese official is accused of covering up evidence of suspected sexual abuse of children. Monsignor William Lynn and the Rev. James Brennan appeared before Common Pleas Judge Teresa Sarmina inside a nearly filled Philadelphia courtroom. The attendees had to pass through a metal detector and surrender all electronic devices before entering the courtroom. Commonwealth prosecutor Jacqueline Coelho told jurors in her nearly hour-long opening statement that Lynn's role was to protect priests, the church and privacy ""at any cost."" Lynn, dressed in all black and wearing a priest collar, listened intently as Coelho argued that he knowingly covered up incidents of sexual abuse, including alleged acts by Brennan, and ""ignored common sense and placed children at risk."" Lynn, 61, who served as the secretary for clergy under former Philadelphia Archbishop Anthony Bevilacqua, is charged with endangering the welfare of a child in connection with the alleged assaults. From 1992 until 2004, Lynn was responsible for investigating reports that priests had sexually abused children. Brennan, 48, is accused of assaulting a 14-year-old boy in 1996. Both pleaded not guilty in April. Their defense attorneys were slated to give their opening statements Monday afternoon. Last year, a Philadelphia grand jury report accused the archdiocese of failing to investigate claims of sexual abuse of children by priests. The grand jury report led to the Philadelphia district attorney's office criminally charging four Philadelphia priests and a parochial school teacher with raping and assaulting boys in their care, while Lynn was accused of allowing the abusive priests to have access to children. Defrocked priest Edward Avery was slated to go on trial with Lynn and Brennan, but he pleaded guilty last week to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and conspiracy to endanger welfare of child, according to court documents. Avery was sentenced to two and a half to five years in prison. He is scheduled to report for his sentence on April 2. The plea agreement does not require Avery to testify against Lynn. Judge Sarmina advised jurors to ""keep an open mind"" and ""not speculate about"" Avery's absence. The Philadelphia scandal could open a historic chapter in the abuse crisis, church watchers say, by changing the way the American criminal justice system deals with church abuse. The charges are unusual because they go beyond accusations against priests and included a church higher-up charged with covering up the abuse, which church experts say has never happened in the United States before. Avery and Charles Engelhardt are charged with assaulting a 10-year-old boy at St. Jerome Parish in Philadelphia in 1998 and 1999. Avery was defrocked in 2006. Bernard Shero, a teacher at the school, is charged with assaulting the same boy there in 2000. Engelhardt and Shero, who pleaded not guilty to sexual abuse and conspiracy charges in April, are facing sex abuse charges and will be tried separately in September. Cardinal Bevilacqua, who died on January 31, testified 10 times before grand juries in 2003 and 2004. A final grand jury report said it had no doubt that the cardinal knew about the danger posed by the accused priests and his actions endangered thousands of children in the archdiocese. Bevilacqua served as archbishop of Philadelphia from February 11, 1988, to October 7, 2003, the archdiocese said in announcing his death. He was elevated to the College of Cardinals on June 28, 1991. Lynn would face a maximum of 14 years in prison if convicted of all charges, according to the district attorney's office. After the release of the January 2011 grand jury report, Cardinal Justin Rigali, who later resigned as Philadelphia's archbishop, placed Lynn on administrative leave. A total of 23 priests in the Philadelphia area have been placed on administrative leave by the archdiocese, 21 on March 7, 2011. The two other priests, who were retired but were allowed to assist in priestly duties, were placed on leave 23 days later. A gag order imposed by a Philadelphia judge remains in effect. It bars all parties involved in the criminal case from talking to the media.","Monsignor William Lynn is accused of covering up evidence of sexual abuse .

"(CNN) -- For Mitt Romney, it's not just a question -- it's more like a campaign illness he'd like to cure once and for all. ""I was hoping I would be asked that question. Great. It's about time,"" Romney joked at a recent GOP forum in New Hampshire. The question, of course, was about the health care reform bill Romney signed into law as governor of Massachusetts in 2006. ""Ours is an experiment. Some parts didn't work,"" he explained to the crowd. What many tea party conservatives can't stand about the Massachusetts health care law dubbed ""Romneycare"" is the plan's individual mandate that requires people in that state to buy medical insurance or pay a tax penalty. The Wall Street Journal in an editorial on Thursday slammed Romney's reluctance to reject the individual mandate. ""If he does not change his message, he might as well try to knock off Joe Biden and get on the Obama ticket,"" the newspaper wrote. Republicans and Democrats alike see ""Romneycare"" as the prototype for what conservatives deride as ""Obamacare."" A similar mandate in the president's health care law is being challenged in federal courts. It's a tight box for Romney: He must convince his fellow Republicans to look past the very health care reform provision that's at the heart of those court challenges. ""The individual mandate is a deal-breaker. People do not want to see government dictating that they purchase what is a private product. We think that's a disaster,"" said Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity. The group is a prominent tea party organizer that also happens to be led by libertarian billionaire David Koch. Phillips is one of countless tea party activists who want to hear Romney reject the mandate. ""I think it will be difficult for a lot of voters to get around if the individual mandate is not repudiated,"" Phillips said. That would be tricky for Romney who has repeatedly defended such mandates as a way to get the uninsured into the health care system. ""In order to get the tax exemption that you would normally get, you have to have health insurance because we want everyone in the system. No more free riders,"" Romney said in a 2009 interview with CNN. In the same interview, Romney suggested that parts of the Massachusetts experiment could serve as a model for national health care reform. ""I think there are a number of features in the Massachusetts plan that could inform Washington on ways to improve health care for all Americans,"" Romney said. Democrats have quotes like that cued up for the 2012 campaign. In a February speech to the National Governors Association, Obama announced his administration's plan to give states more flexibility in implementing the new national health care law. The president worked in a dig at Romney. ""I agree with Mitt Romney, who recently said he's proud of what he accomplished on health care in Massachusetts and supports giving states the power to determine their own health care solutions. He's right,"" Obama said. ""Mr. President, why didn't you call and ask how it worked,"" Romney responded at that GOP forum in New Hampshire. It will be a hard sell for Republicans. Former Arkansas governor and potential 2012 rival Mike Huckabee has described ""Romneycare"" as ""socialized medicine."" Romney has said repeatedly the Massachusetts law is not perfect. In speech after speech, the former governor has claimed the plan was never intended as a ""one-size fits all"" program for the country. ""We should learn from what's working and what's not working in Massachusetts,"" Romney told CNN in 2009. The former governor, who has yet to declare his candidacy for 2012, has a new health care plan that he is to release Thursday. It would repeal and replace the national health care law. Instead, states would be allowed to conduct their own experiments in health care reform. It's a potentially defining issue for a campaign that hasn't officially launched. ""Somehow he's got to convince the tea party people that he's learned from his mistake without admitting he made a mistake. Good luck,"" said Larry Sabato with the University of Virginia Center for Politics. Romney's staff says don't expect an apology for ""Romneycare."" After all, this is a man whose latest book is entitled ""No Apology.""","Mitt Romney is the former governor of Massachusetts and 2008 GOP presidential nominee .

"(CNN) -- It has been five years since Mohammad Z. left Syria to train as a doctor in Detroit. He works long hours. He's big on hockey. He's devoted to the Red Wings. He's immersed in America, yet his heart is with Syria and the Syrian people. It's hell inside Syria. But for Mohammed and other Syrian expatriates who want to end the regime of Bashar al-Assad, this is a kind of golden moment. Ethnic and religious and political divisions are melting away to serve one shimmering goal. ""I can't tell you how many wonderful Syrians I have met here who've devoted their money and time to see a democratic, free Syria,"" said Mohammed, whose last name is being withheld by CNN to protect his brother and parents in Syria. ""You see the Christians, the Muslims, the nonreligious people; you see people from different ethnic backgrounds: Arabic, Assyrian and Kurds."" An underground newspaper in Syria recently published an essay of Mohammad's. In it, he wrote, ""The revolution has brought us together, and we had scattered in loneliness."" For Mohammad and many other Syrian expatriates, there is no going back to the old Syria. For them, Syria has to change. ""These are people who've been exposed to the American culture and brought up in an environment -- even in Syria -- where there was Internet and dishes and satellites and they can see how the rest of the world lives,"" said Naser Danan, a Cleveland-based doctor with the Syrian Expatriates Organization. While the expat group has members in other Arab countries and in Europe, Danan estimated that a majority of the 600 or so members are young doctors in the United States -- ironic, because al-Assad himself has a medical degree. The group supports an end to al-Assad's regime, though it doesn't act as a political opposition entity. Members raise money to buy food and medicine for Syrians caught in the violence, and they speak in public about what's going on in Syria. Cancer researcher Hazem Hallak recently spoke to a group of high-school students in Ardmore, Pennsylvania. When one of the students asked how he reacts to the latest videos coming out of Syria, Hallak said he doesn't watch anymore. He explained why by describing the last video he watched from Syria. Someone recorded Syrian soldiers invading a house looking for the husband of the household. When they didn't find him, Hallak said, they cut off the head of his young son, hung it in the doorway and told his wife, ""This is what will happen to your husband if he doesn't turn himself in."" Last May, Hallak's brother, a doctor in Syria, was arrested and killed -- his body mutilated -- after he returned from a trip to the United States. A few expatriates in the United States are part of the Syrian National Council, the group that many Syrians consider to be the official political opposition. One of them is George Netto, a cancer specialist who teaches and practices at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Netto, who is Christian by birth, said he joined the opposition group ""to show it's really the entire spectrum of the Syrian people fighting the regime: Christian, Sunnis, poor, rich, educated and noneducated ... we wanted to burst that bubble they're trying to depict that it's only armed radicals or armed gangs."" In Detroit, Mohammad said he was going to anti-al-Assad rallies even before the Syrian secret police, the Mukhabarhat, arrested his brother who was protesting in Syria. Mohammad said the police kept his brother locked up for three months. He said they interrogated him and tortured him from day one. (Listen to Mohammed read his brother's essay about that time) After three months, the police let Mohammed's brother go to make room for a wave of new prisoners. But as soon as he was freed, he returned to protesting. Mohammad said he would not tell his brother to stop protesting. If he were in Syria now, he said, he would do the same thing. ""This is not only an uprising,"" he said. ""It's an epic, a human epic that's being written by the Syrian people.""","Syrian expatriates across the world are uniting against the regime of Bashar al-Assad .

"(CNN) -- As Sen. John McCain bowed out of the historic presidential election Tuesday night, he urged his supporters to bridge their differences with Sen. Barack Obama and unite for the good of the country. Supporters of John McCain react as their candidate concedes in Phoenix, Arizona. ""Sen. Obama and I have had and argued our differences, and he has prevailed. No doubt many of those differences remain. These are difficult times for our country. And I pledge to him tonight to do all in my power to help him lead us through the many challenges we face,"" he said. Just the mention of the Democrat's name elicited boos from the sea of teary-eyed McCain supporters at the Arizona Biltmore in Phoenix, Arizona. Members of the dejected crowd shouted ""no way!"" when McCain promised to work with Obama.  Watch McCain's concession speech » . As McCain graciously acknowledged defeat, it was clear that not all of his supporters were ready to rally behind the president-elect. Kevin Neugebauer of Katy, Texas, said he was ""really disappointed "" and ""distraught"" about his party's loss. ""Being a conservative, I think the Republican Party's kind of lost some of their identity of who they are. I really don't understand how it could happen,"" he said. ""I don't know if it's really sunk in. It's hard to understand.""  Watch more on McCain's loss » . Other McCain voters took their frustrations to the Internet, finding solidarity on anti-Obama sites. ""We have to watch this guy and not give him an inch,"" one McCain supporter wrote. ""The same way he criticized every move of President Bush. We have to make things as difficult for him as he did for Bush.""  See what CNN analysts had to say about the Obama win » . ""The new mantra for all of us,"" another supporter declared. Some voters wrote that they cried through the night, declaring Tuesday a ""sad day"" for the country, while others encouraged Republicans to ""hold your heads up high."" McCain's concession was reminiscent of Sen. Hillary Clinton's call for unity when she abandoned her campaign last June and urged her 18 million voters to rally behind Obama.  See what Clinton and others had to say about the win » . The New York senator's endorsement was met with a scattering of boos and thumbs-downs from the crowd, and some ardent Clinton backers vowed to never embrace Obama. Even as Clinton campaigned hard for Obama, there were questions about whether her voters would follow suit. In the final weeks of campaigning, McCain and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin saw a similar degree of passion at their events, and with that passion came rage from some supporters. Some McCain voters called Obama a ""terrorist,"" and others said they were afraid of an Obama presidency. McCain was booed when he urged everyone to be respectful and not fear Obama. Obama won the presidency with the support of 63 million voters, but he must now win the confidence of the other 56 million who thought McCain was the better candidate. Obama reached out to those voters in his victory speech Tuesday night, telling them, ""I may not have won your vote tonight, but I hear your voices. I need your help. And I will be your president, too."" As Obama transitions into power, Democratic strategist Donna Brazile says, he should ask McCain to help set a new tone in the country. ""A tone that would allow the American people to come together. The one mistake that we continue to make is that we label people. We say you're conservatives, liberal, progressive, right wing, left wing. I think people just want to spend one day being Americans. They want to come together around a common purpose, common values,"" she said. ""I think this is a wonderful moment, not just to re-brand one party or to give another party a mandate, but to give the American people a future that they deserve.""

"(CNN) -- Substitute Javier Hernandez scored a late header as champions Manchester United fought back from three goals down to earn a remarkable 3-3 Premier League draw at Chelsea on Sunday. On a bitterly cold afternoon in south-west London, United knew they needed a victory at Stamford Bridge to keep pace with rivals Manchester City at the top of the table. But they got off to a poor start and went into the interval a goal behind after defender Johnny Evans had inadvertently turned Daniel Sturridge's cross into his own net. And United then suffered a double blow early in the second half as two goals in the space of just five minutes looked to have handed Chelsea victory. With the second 45 minutes barely a minute old, Fernando Torres' crash was superbly volleyed home by fellow-Spaniard Juan Mata to double Chelsea's lead. And United's defense was found wanting again soon afterwards when David Luiz was left unmarked to head home a free-kick. The visitors had been denied two first-half penalty appeals by referee Howard Webb, but the World Cup final official had no hesitation in pointing to the spot when Sturridge fouled Patrice Evra in the area. Wayne Rooney smashed home the 58th minute spot-kick to make it 3-1 and Rooney again held his nerve from the spot just 11 minutes later, this time Branislav Ivanovic was adjudged to have tripped Danny Welbeck. By now United were in the ascendency, and they drew level when Hernandez found space in the area to head home Ryan Giggs' cross from close range six minutes from time. However, only a superb flying save from much-criticized United goalkeeper David de Gea, to keep out Mata's last-minute free-kick, ensured the points were shared. Despite the fightback, United lose ground in the title race, with City now two points ahead of their rivals, with a much better goal difference as well. Chelsea remain in fourth place on 43 points, but Newcastle are now only a point behind in fifth after their Senegalese international strikers combined to beat Aston Villa 2-1. Demba Ba scored his 16th goal of the season, second only to Arsenal's Robin van Persie, to give Newcastle the lead, only for Robbie Keane to level for Villa from close range. But debutant Papiss Demba Cisse secured the three points for Newcastle with a stunning strike that arrowed into the top corner of the Villa net with 19 minutes remaining.","Manchester United fight back from 3-0 down to earn a draw at Chelsea .

"(CNN) -- Davy Jones was more than just the star of countless bedroom wall collages in the late 1960s. The Monkees frontman and token Brit who captivated audiences with his talent and charisma was the quintessential teen heartthrob. News of Jones' passing (he died of a heart attack at age 66 Wednesday) prompted nostalgic outbursts from fans, all wanting to reminisce about the Tiger Beat and 16 Magazine covers, the hours logged in front of the TV, and the moments spent bopping around to ""Pleasant Valley Sunday."" CNN.com commenter rosemeow wrote: ""Sad feeling, when pieces of your childhood start falling away. There goes another piece of mine."" Whether the grief stems from the feeling of closing a chapter in one's own life, or the larger question of mortality, the death of a former teen idol can have a profound effect on fans. Like Michael Jackson, who died in 2009, and Whitney Houston, who died last month, Jones was someone younger generations looked up to as ""the first person who made them interested in music,"" said Phil Gallo, Billboard's senior correspondent. For many people, The Monkees were the first group they could claim as their own, as opposed to the music that belonged to their parents, Gallo added. ""That really affects people,"" he said. And then there was Jones' teen heartthrob status. ""If you talked to any girl who liked The Monkees, invariably, (Jones) was her favorite,"" Gallo said. ""It's the lead singer. It's the cute one. The one who's got the nice personality."" But that fandom isn't limited to the girls who would've gladly traded a limb for a date with Jones. ""When I was a kid, I wanted to BE Davy Jones,"" actor Kevin Bacon tweeted. ""Big part of what led me to showbiz."" iReport: Share your memories of Davy Jones . A lot of the people who are grieving this loss are in their 40s and 50s, Gallo said, adding, ""It's a case of, 'Wow, he's one of me.' People think of him as, 'He's from my lifetime. He's my age.' "" And though it seems like a far departure, that's how today's youths will view pop star Justin Bieber. Sure, the magazines have changed -- now it's J-14 and Twist -- and Jones' fitted button-down shirts have been replaced by purple hoodies. But the significance of teen idols remains the same. (Ironically, so does the hair.) In 2008, one year before Bieber earned his teen heartthrob status, Yahoo! Music named Jones the top teen idol of all time, ahead of Jackson and David Cassidy, who shared the honor with Bobby Sherman and Donny Osmond in the early 1970s. Taking a page out of The Monkees' book, Bieber has taken advantage of this time in the limelight, releasing a memoir, a movie, appearing on ""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,"" and touring, all while making music. Jones guest-starred as himself in a 1971 episode of ""The Brady Bunch,"" appropriately titled ""Getting Davy Jones."" The now iconic episode, in which Jones performs ""Girl"" for Marcia at her prom, was beloved by fans. ""There's something about The Monkees and what that told us about pop culture and how music and TV and, eventually, film can work together,"" Gallo said. ""This is sort of a lesson that people can still learn from, and it keeps getting repeated five decades later."" The Beatles -- the group that inspired The Monkees -- released ""A Hard Day's Night"" in 1964. Three decades later, '90s superstars, The Spice Girls, came out with the movie ""Spice World."" ""The teen idol marketplace is really a two- to five-year window,"" Gallo said, and that was understood back when The Monkees were at their peak. But the thing that makes The Monkees different is that their music managed to transcend generations, Gallo said. ""Oldies radio or commercials or ... on TV shows, (their music) kept getting used in the '70s and '80s, so when they had a comeback, there was an audience for it."" After first finding fame in the late '80s and mid '90s, New Kids On The Block and Backstreet Boys, respectively, experienced a comeback of sorts when they toured together. As former fans become parents, and introduce their children to The Monkees, Gallo said, their audience will grow. Not to mention that Smash Mouth's version of ""I'm a Believer"" appeared in 2001's ""Shrek."" CNN.com commenter papanez wrote: ""Davy and The Monkees were very special to me. I enjoyed them back in the '60s, I had a blast introducing my daughter to them when she was little, and I very much enjoyed their reunions."" ""There will come a day that somebody is going to play The Spice Girls or *NSYNC for their kids and say, 'Let me tell you how great music used to be,' "" Gallo said. ""It's kind of hard for us to fathom, but in the same ways someone says 'Pleasant Valley Sunday' is a great song and, 'They don't write (songs) that way anymore,' I'm sure somebody will say that about 'Backstreet's Back' one day.""","Davy Jones died of a heart attack at age 66 Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- Syrian state TV aired Saturday what it said was a confession by citizen journalist Ali Mahmoud Othman, who activists say was arrested in March after he helped foreign journalists escape from the besieged city of Homs. Othman helped run a media center in Baba Amr area of Homs, which provided information to international news media during a months-long crackdown on the civilian neighborhood by government forces. Reporters Without Borders, the journalist watchdog group, said last month it was ""extremely concerned"" for the life of Othman after his detention. Othman was transferred to Damascus two days after his arrest by the intelligence services in Aleppo on March 28, the group said. Activists fear he may have been subjected to torture in detention. Rafiq Lutf, described as a Syrian media researcher, told the state TV program he had spoken to Othman for seven hours uninterrupted, all of it videotaped. His subject states his name is ""Ali Othman aka Al-Jid from Baba Amr of Homs. I work as photography director and live streaming with Khalid Abu Salah at the media center. I communicate with the satellite channels, on top of them Al Jazeera, Arabiya, CNN, BBC, Sky News and Turkish channel TRT."" In the interview Othman describes how the media operation was set up in Baba Amr, and talks about demonstrations and the role of armed groups. It is unclear under what circumstances the interview was taped. But Heather Blake, UK representative for Reporters Without Borders, said: ""Research by our organization and many other organizations indicates that many human rights defenders who are detained have been shown to give false confessions under much duress and torture. ""We would advise anyone watching this to be very aware of that fact. The fact that Othman was arrested after committing no crime would suggest that he is speaking under duress."" Reporters Without Borders calls for Othman's release and for justice to be served, Blake said. Foreign news outlets have been severely limited during the government's bloody year-long crackdown against protesters. Critics say that the government has been dutifully working to stifle such independent reporting. Amateur videographers and news reporters dubbed ""citizen journalists"" have braved violence to undermine the government's news coverage restrictions. They have helped those international journalists who were able to sneak into Syria and report. And they have produced videos, photos and print reports every day that bear witness to the brutal crackdown. Those reports have helped news outlets around the world tell the story of the violence. Speaking shortly after Othman's arrest, Paul Conroy, a British photographer who was injured in the Baba Amr offensive, said the regime was taking steps ""to ensure that independent reporting becomes impossible."" He said Othman helped him escape from Baba Amr, hammered for weeks by the military until resistance fighters retreated. Activists say other parts of the city continue to be shelled. ""After the attack and treatment of the wounded he played a significant role in assisting in our escape from Baba Amr. All our efforts must now be concentrated on saving his life. If it wasn't for him, no Western media would have been able to work in Baba Amr and bear witness to the slaughter of the civilian population,"" Conroy said. The team that worked with Othman in Baba Amr has been pushing for the release of Othman and other detained activists. Reporters Without Borders has also called for their release. ""Citizen journalists whose only crimes are to have witnessed, filmed and photographed acts of violence by a regime that persists in its deadly folly are being hunted down, arrested, tortured and murdered,"" the group said in a statement last month. ""We hold the Syrian authorities responsible for whatever may happen to them. The regime is more determined than ever to suppress all information about its crackdown. Syria has become a hell for both professional and citizen journalists."" A peace plan brokered by international envoy Kofi Annan last month calls on Syria to ensure freedom of movement for journalists in the country. An apparent violation occurred this week when Sky News, a British broadcaster, said Syrian officials confiscated a television camera after a crew filmed an impromptu protest in Damascus. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","NEW: Abu Othman may well have been speaking under duress, Reporters Without Borders says .

"(CNN)  -- Healthy men and women with good cholesterol levels could significantly reduce their risk of heart disease by taking cholesterol-lowering drugs, better known as statins, according to a study released at the American Heart Association meetings in November. Today, only people with high levels of cholesterol are prescribed cholesterol-lowering drugs, known as statins. Nearly 18,000 people in 26 countries, including 7,000 women and nearly 5,000 minorities, participated in the clinical trial, the results of which were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. All had very good cholesterol levels, with average LDL -- or ""bad"" cholesterol -- levels of 108 and average HDL --or ""good"" cholesterol -- levels of 49. However, each participant had elevated levels of ""high-sensitivity C-reactive protein"" or hs-CRP -- a marker that indicates inflammation in the body and can contribute to coronary heart disease, the No. 1 killer of men and women in the United States. Under the current guidelines set for lowering cholesterol levels, none of the participants would have qualified for taking statins. In the study, the participants took 20 milligrams of the drug Rosuvastatin -- commercially known as Crestor -- or a placebo pill. The maker of Crestor, AstraZeneca, funded the study. According to the lead author, Dr. Paul Ridker of the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, the pharmaceutical company had no input in the study's design and didn't see the final data analysis until the study was submitted for publication. Designed to last up to five years, the trial was stopped after less than two because endpoints set by an independent oversight committee were met, the study says. Researchers found that participants taking Crestor cut their risk of heart attack, stroke and death by nearly half -- 44 percent -- compared with participants taking the placebo. Bad cholesterol levels were reduced by 50 percent and hs-CRP levels dropped 37 percent. Overall death in the Crestor group was 20 percent less than the placebo group. ""This is a huge reduction, unprecedented reduction in risk occurring very quickly,"" said Dr. Steven Nissen, a cardiologist at Ohio's Cleveland Clinic, who has studied the significance of CRP in predicting heart disease. Nissen estimates that 36 million Americans qualify for statins and that the new research could add at least 10 million to the ranks of who should be taking cholesterol-lowering drugs. Some published reports suggest the number could be twice as high. The study's statistician, Harvard University's Robert Glynn, estimates that about 250,000 heart attacks, strokes, hospitalizations and cardiac deaths could be prevented over five years if people with good cholesterol and high hs-CRP levels were taking statins. Ridker, the lead author, said doing so would benefit patients and health care providers, noting a simple blood test to detect hs-CRP levels is much cheaper than hospitalization. Blog: Heart disease and cholesterol . Ridker said the diversity of the participants, including women, African-Americans and Hispanics, is significant because there is limited information on preventing heart disease among those demographic groups. Today, only people with high levels of cholesterol are prescribed statins. Those with good cholesterol levels typically don't have their hs-CRP levels tested because there are no clear guidelines on who should be tested and how often. ""These studies show that CRP levels are now emerging as an important risk factor in the development and progression of coronary heart disease,"" said Dr. Elizabeth Nabel, director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, referring to this study and two others being presented at an American Heart Association conference this weekend. Dr. Mark Hlatky, a professor of health policy and cardiology at Stanford University, reviewed the study for The New England Journal of Medicine. Hlatky agreed the study ""provides more evidence about the effectiveness of statin therapy in reducing cardiovascular risk,"" even among people who don't currently meet the guidelines for this kind of therapy. But he suggested that before changing any guidelines, more research needs to be done to determine the effectiveness of testing people for hs-CRP levels, something this study was not designed to do.","Study: Statins can help healthy with good cholesterol levels cut heart disease risk .

"(CNN) -- A Texas man who is a self-proclaimed supporter of Anonymous says he's joining the hacking ring's purported fight against one of Mexico's most violent drug cartels. Barrett Brown, 30, told CNN that in the next two days he expects to receive thousands of e-mails naming alleged Zetas drug gang affiliates that he's been told were taken by hackers from a Mexican government website. ""It's possible this is all a big hoax, (but) I'm more involved in this because of the possibility of striking a blow against the Zetas. ... The issue to me was more about how do we do this operation. I'm intent on what we could do with the information when we release it,"" Brown told CNN in a telephone interview Thursday. The Dallas resident, who describes himself as a former member of Anonymous and has frequently spoken publicly about his involvement in Anonymous activities, posted a YouTube video Wednesday explaining why he planned to join the effort. ""I've decided to support the operation, which I understand is controversial for a number of reasons. In this case, there are lives hanging in the balance, in that those who are identified are likely to be killed,"" Brown says in the video, leaning back in a leather desk chair as he smokes a cigarette. He told CNN he learned about the so-called OpCartel after Mexican members of Anonymous reached out to him in an online chat forum. In the video, Brown says he wants to help Mexicans in their effort to stop cartel violence. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration says more than 43,000 people have died in drug-related violence in Mexico since December 2006, when President Felipe Calderon began a crackdown on cartels. Some Mexicans have decided to take matters into their own hands, Brown says, doing what they can to stop the Zetas. Is Mexican cartel the next 'Anonymous' target? ""It's Mexicans themselves who started this operation, who conceived it. It's not a bunch of stereotypical computer geeks sitting somewhere else in safety. These are people on the ground,"" he says. The purported threat against the Zetas began in early October with an online video of a masked man warning that the names, photographs and addresses of cartel supporters in the Mexican state of Veracruz can be published ""if necessary."" The video demanded the release of a member of Anonymous who had allegedly been abducted by the Zetas in Veracruz. A website purporting to be an official site connected with Anonymous in Latin America said early Friday the person who had been abducted had been released, ""bruised ... [but] alive and well"". CNN could not verify that the abduction took place or that the alleged kidnap victim had been released. A Veracruz government spokeswoman said no such kidnapping complaint had been registered with local officials. This week, another video purportedly from Anonymous surfaced, vowing to continue the campaign -- but warning of the possible risks. ""This is not a video game. It's a dangerous operation that puts at risk the lives of you and your loved ones. Don't identify yourself as a member of Anonymous. You should never do it, but even less right now,"" a masked man in that video says. It's unclear whether Anonymous is behind either online video, or what the organization plans to do. The hacking group has no clear leader and no central official website. The website claiming to be an official site connected with Anonymous in Latin America also said Friday that no information on the Zetas would be released -- for now. ""A message has been sent to us, that if Anonymous reveals a name related with the cartel, the family of the kidnapped Anonymous member will suffer the consequences, for every cartel name that is revealed, 10 people will be put to death. ... The collective Anonymous has decided by consensus that the information that we have available will not be revealed for the time being, now that we understand that we cannot avoid the threats that involve innocent civilians that don't have anything to do with our actions,"" the site said. But other online posts -- which CNN was also able to independently verify -- have said the operation is moving forward. ""Looking over the forums of Anonymous discussions, it is clear that there has been disagreement over whether or not to pursue and publicize information on the cartels,"" Ben West, a tactical analyst for the STRATFOR global intelligence firm, wrote in an e-mail to CNN Thursday night. ""Many Anonymous members seem to be aware of the threat that the Mexican cartels pose and seem disinclined to risk the consequences of incurring the cartels' wrath."" Earlier Thursday, a security analysis from the intelligence firm said it seemed likely that some members of the organization would move forward with the purported plan. ""Anonymous' collective nature means activists can select the actions they participate in, including Operation Cartel. It would only take one dedicated individual to continue the operation,"" the analysis said. Brown, the Texas man, said he planned to use a computer database to methodically sift through the e-mails he receives, verify them with the help of an experienced journalist and a cartel expert and then possibly release names -- or entire e-mails -- in small batches over time. ""If we have 100 names, we'll release 30 or 40 names that seem right,"" he told CNN. Brown's online video -- which showed his face and was posted under his own name -- is notably different than many Anonymous posts, which commonly feature men in Guy Fawkes masks. He told CNN Thursday that he was not afraid to come forward. ""I don't feel I should be. I should have the right and the ability as someone who is a fairly public person to work to ID criminals in a foreign country without having to worry about being murdered,"" he said. Brown also said he had weighed the possibility of wrongly identifying someone, or causing killings. ""Both my grandfathers were bombers in World War II (and) they killed innocent people and did it with less information. I'm more confident about the ratio. I'd be surprised if many people (in the e-mails) were incorrect,"" he said. While whether -- and who -- Anonymous planned to attack remained unclear, some self-proclaimed members of the group were already declaring at least one victory. Last week and this week a former Mexican state prosecutor's website was apparently hacked, with bold letters stating he ""is Zeta."" Late Thursday night, the website featured a picture of a Mexican Day of the Dead offering and the words, ""Anonymous Mexico OpCartel continues."" In the past few years, Anonymous has taken credit for disrupting a number of prominent websites, including those of PayPal, Master Card, Visa and the Church of Scientology. In September, the group claimed it was targeting the Mexican government, launching attacks on a range of official websites, including those of Mexico's defense and public safety ministries. The Zetas started with deserters from the Mexican Army, and quickly gained a reputation for ruthless violence as the armed branch of Mexico's Gulf cartel. It split off into a separate drug-trafficking organization last year. In recent months, the Gulf coast state of Veracruz has become a frequent site of clashes between armed groups as drug-related violence grows. In September, 35 bodies were abandoned in a roadway during rush-hour traffic in a popular tourist area there, two days before a meeting of high-ranking state prosecutors and judges.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration Thursday evening asked a federal appeals court in California to reconsider its order last week temporarily blocking the U.S. military from enforcing its ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy on gays and lesbians serving in the military. U.S. officials have been moving ahead with dismantling the policy but had objected to having the courts force the government to officially repeal it at this time. At issue in the complex legal fight is whether ""don't ask, don't tell"" can remain in effect -- even in name only -- while the legal fight over its constitutionality is being carried out in the federal courts. Judges have been at odds over the enforcement issue for months. The case has put the Obama administration in an unusual position of supporting a repeal, but at the same time filing court motions to prevent it from happening faster than planned. Military officials suggest the policy compliance changes eliminating ""don't ask, don't tell"" could be finished in a few weeks. Federal courts -- including the Supreme Court -- have bounced back and forth over the temporary enforcement question, ignoring for now the larger question's of the federal law's constitutionality. In its second appeal Thursday, the Justice Department in an emergency motion said the federal courts are overstepping their authority. ""The Armed Forces are moving forward expeditiously to prepare for the repeal of (""Don't Ask/ Don't Tell) in a fashion that Congress and the President consider the most effective way possible, and consistent with the nation's military needs,"" said the appeal. ""The (judicial) panel's order cuts that process short and overrides the judgments of Congress and the President on a complex and important question of military policy."" In a brief order a week ago, the 9th U.S. Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals said ""the process of repealing (the policy) is well underway, and the preponderance of the armed forces are expected to have been trained by mid-summer"" on abiding by the new guidelines. However, said the three-judge panel, ""The circumstances and balance of hardships have changed,"" concluding that as a result, ""don't ask, don't tell"" cannot remain in place. The San Francisco-based appeals court's order is temporary, until it can fully hear the issue with oral arguments in late August. A gay rights group -- the Log Cabin Republicans -- had sued over the 18-year-old ban on openly gay and lesbian members serving in the U.S. armed forces. In September, U.S. District Judge Virginia Phillips declared the military's ban to be unconstitutional, and demanded the government immediately stop enforcing it. Congress has since passed legislation signed by President Barack Obama to gradually eliminate ""don't ask, don't tell,"" but Pentagon officials had refused to issue a timeline on when that policy change would be completed. It is an issue Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, who took over the post this month, will now have to confront. If ""don't ask, don't tell"" is fully dismantled, and any current investigations of gay and lesbian service members are suspended, the legal appeals might quickly become moot. But the Log Cabin Republicans have vowed to continue the legal fight until then. The Supreme Court last fall upheld an earlier order keeping the policy in place. Log Cabin Republicans slammed the administration's newest court action. ""This latest maneuver by the President continues a pattern of doublespeak that all Americans should find troubling. All this does is further confuse the situation for our men and women in uniform,"" said R. Clarke Cooper, the group's executive director, who is also a captain in the Army Reserve. ""'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' is an offense to American values that should have been gone long ago. It is shameful that a president who has taken credit for opposing the policy is taking extreme measures to keep it on life support."" Obama had said he long wanted to repeal ""don't ask, don't tell,"" and had reached an agreement with then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on a process that included a military review of how to make a successful transition to openly gay and lesbian soldiers serving. The three men would then have to certify the repeal. Gay rights groups say the policy -- even as it is being discarded -- violates the due process and First Amendment rights of military members. In their appeals, the Log Cabin Republicans said allowing the policy to remain in effect pending appeal would be unacceptable and would cause ""irreparable harm."" The government presented ""no evidence to support a finding that open service by gay and lesbian individuals harmed the military's interests, and ... both civilian and military leaders admitted that DADT actually impairs military interests,"" the appeal claimed. ""Deference to military judgment here tips the scales against a stay, rather than in favor of one,"" it said. But the Obama administration, supported by Pentagon officials, argued that suspending the policy and forcing the military to immediately change course while the case is being appealed would cause problems during a time of war. ""The military should not be required to suddenly and immediately restructure a major personnel policy that has been in place for years, particularly during a time when the nation is involved in combat operations overseas,"" said the government in an earlier legal brief. After the court's order last week, Pentagon spokesman Col. Dave Lapan said the military ""will of course comply with orders of the court, and are taking immediately steps to inform the field of this order."" He added, ""In the meantime, implementation of the DADT repeal voted by the Congress and signed in to law by the President last December is proceeding smoothly, is well underway, and certification is just weeks away."" Gates last fall raised the level at which gay and lesbian troops can be discharged under ""don't ask, don't tell"" by ordering that it only be done by the secretaries of the Army, Navy and Air Force. In a memo written to the heads of all the military services, Gates said his action was taken in direct response to the legal uncertainty surrounding ""don't ask, don't tell"" law. The case is Log Cabin Republicans v. U.S. (10-56634).","An appeals court ruled last week that ""don't ask, don't tell"" cannot remain in place .
The Obama administration is asking the court to reconsider that ruling .
The administration supports the repeal but objects to having courts set the timing ."
"(CNN) -- Detroit Tigers outfielder Delmon Young was arrested in Manhattan on Friday and charged with aggravated harassment after a dispute with another man, New York police said. Young appeared intoxicated when police arrived at the scene outside the Hilton New York hotel, and he was treated and released from a hospital Friday morning, police Detective Martin Speechley said. The other man, who was not identified, sustained minor injuries but refused treatment, Speechley said. The aggravated harassment charge is a misdemeanor, but Speechley said the case is being investigated as a possible hate crime because of ""religious statements made"" during the dispute. If there is evidence to support a hate crime, the seriousness of the charge would be ""elevated,"" he said. A criminal complaint states Young made an anti-Semitic remark, according to CNN affiliate WABC. Young did not speak to reporters on camera, but issued a statement. ""I sincerely regret what happened last night,"" Young said, according to WABC. ""I take this matter very seriously and assure everyone that I will do everything I can to improve myself as a person and player."" The team issued a brief statement Friday afternoon. ""We are aware of the situation, however it is our club policy not to comment on pending legal matters,"" the statement said. ""As we understand it, this is an allegation and we need to allow the legal process to take its course."" The Tigers are in New York for a three-game series against the Yankees. Detroit lost the first game Friday to the Yankees.","Report: A criminal complaint says Delmon Young made an anti-Semitic remark .

"(CNN) -- Police attacked the former Maldives president Wednesday, beating him up a day after he stepped down, the Maldivian Democratic Party said. ""We strongly condemned the violent attack by the Maldivian Police Service on President (Mohamed) Nasheed and senior officials of the MDP,"" the party said in a written statement. ""President Nasheed is being beaten up as of now in an ongoing peaceful protest."" Four members of Parliament were detained as violence gripped the nation's capital, Male, lawmaker Eva Abdulla said, and the head of the party was hospitalized in critical condition. Police sprayed tear gas and beat demonstrators with batons, she said, and the violence left some protesters bleeding in the streets. ""It's absolute lack of order at the moment,"" she said. ""Nobody seems to be in charge."" Police could not be immediately reached for comment. Earlier Wednesday, Nasheed had called for his successor to leave office, saying he was forced to resign in a coup. Nasheed resigned Tuesday after a revolt by police officers. Vice President Mohammed Waheed Hassan was sworn in as president shortly after Nasheed resigned. Nasheed was the first democratically elected president of the Indian Ocean nation in three decades. In a nationally televised address, he said he was stepping down because he didn't feel he was able to maintain security and peace in the country, which attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists every year. ""We're urging the government and the political parties to work together to resolve the situation peacefully and we're continuing to monitor the situation,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Wednesday. She said U.S. envoy Robert Blake would make a stop in Male on Saturday as part of previously scheduled trip to the region. Strategically located in the Indian Ocean but extremely poor, the Maldives is threatened by rising sea levels. Nasheed once held a Cabinet meeting underwater, with ministers wearing scuba gear, to highlight the problem. CNN's Catherine E.

"(CNN) -- Penn State quarterbacks coach Jay Paterno says he has resigned from the university's embattled football program after meeting with the school's new coach. Jay Paterno's resignation comes two months after his father, legendary head coach Joe Paterno, was fired over the sexual abuse scandal that erupted in November. Penn State named New England Patriots offensive coordinator Bill O'Brien to replace the elder Paterno last week. ""After talking with Coach Bill O'Brien, we have reached the conclusion that I will not be a part of the Penn State football staff moving forward,"" Jay Paterno said in a written statement. ""I will spend the next few weeks consulting with my wife and family to weigh various future options both inside and outside of football."" Penn State has been rocked by accusations that former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky had sexually abused young boys over a 14-year period -- and that school officials failed to take complaints about Sandusky to police. University trustees fired the elder Paterno and school President Graham Spanier after a grand jury report on the case in November. In his statement, Jay Paterno thanked Penn State students and fans for their support ""over the past seventeen seasons and in particular the past two months."" ""Through the tumult of the past several weeks, it has been your stalwart support combined with life lessons learned from Joe Paterno that has and continue to sustain us,"" he said. In November, the younger Paterno said that while his world turned ""upside down"" when the scandal erupted, ""We've got to make sure we keep focus on the victims of this whole tragedy."" The scandal unraveled after a grand jury report accused Sandusky of more than 50 counts of sexually abusing boys. Sandusky has pleaded not guilty to the charges. A Penn State graduate assistant, Mike McQueary, told the grand jury that he had seen Sandusky raping a boy in a Penn State locker room in 2002 and that he had gone to Paterno with what he saw. Paterno said he'd never been told the graphic details revealed in a grand jury report, but that he nevertheless passed the allegations on to his boss. After first saying he had done ""what I was supposed to do,"" the elder Paterno said that ""with the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had done more."" He was fired November 9. It was years before law enforcement learned about the allegation. Then-Athletic Director Tim Curley and Gary Schultz, a university vice president who oversaw campus police, now face charges of perjury and failing to report child sexual abuse.","Jay Paterno resigns after meeting with new coach Bill O'Brien .

"(CNN) -- Based on profits, Sony Corp. is an outstanding company -- in life insurance sales and hit movies such as the ""Men in Black"" and ""Spider-Man"" franchises. But in the industry where Sony made its name -- consumer electronics -- the company needs a lifeline as it finishes its fiscal year with a record $6.4 billion loss. New CEO Kazuo Hirai, who took the helm on April 1, promised Thursday to cut 10,000 jobs -- about 6% of its workforce -- in the next year. Moreover, Hirai is refocusing the business away from its once mighty television division to focus on the core businesses of digital imaging, game and mobile products. ""Our entertainment and financial services are poised for future growth,"" Hirai said. ""Our biggest challenge: Rebuilding and future growth of our electronics business. (That) won't come about by easy fixes or tricks. We must tackle it head-on."" The company plans to grow its medical instruments division, he said, and reinvest in research and design. ""We must surprise customers with innovative projects, that represents Sony's return to glory. ""Now is the time for Sony to change,"" he declared, a refrain throughout the hour-long press conference. Sony faced the same headwinds battling Japan Inc. the past year. The yen reached record highs, eroding profit margins for export-driven companies. Natural disasters hit balance sheets, with record floods in Thailand -- a center for offshore electronics production -- doing as much financial damage as the 2011 Tohoku quake and tsunami for some Japanese firms. Sony's annus horribilis was further mired by the hacking of its popular PlayStation Network, compromising the personal data of more than 77 million users. But Sony's problems predate these recent woes -- the conglomerate has failed to turn a profit for the past four years. ""If you look at the automobile industry in Japan, it didn't suffer as much as the electronics makers,"" said Thomas Kang, research director for Strategy Analytics in Seoul. ""So you can't just blame the exchange rate -- there's something else wrong here."" The problem, analysts say, represents an existential crisis for Sony: Does it want to be a content company or a gadget maker? Hirai's steps to scale down its television operations were long overdue, analysts said. ""The television business hasn't made any more for the last eight years -- any rational manager would have shut that down by now,"" said Ben Collett, head of Japanese equities for Louis Capital Markets. ""I don't know how you can run a business that loses that kind of money."" The company's share price under previous CEO Sir Howard Stringer hit a high of 7,150 yen in May 2007 in the wake of the company's PlayStation3 release. But the price has dropped nearly 80% in the past five years. ""My view on a stock is always relative to its price, and for a long time now there have been better stocks and better companies in almost every line of business that Sony is in, save possibly for its financial services business,"" Collett said. For the company that revolutionized the electronics world with low-cost televisions and iconic devices such as the Walkman, the company's core business is now an albatross around its neck -- outmaneuvered by more nimble companies such as Apple and undercut on price by competitors like Samsung. ""In the case of electronics, the life cycle is much shorter, there have been a lot of new breakthroughs,"" Kung said. ""Sony didn't make the right choices when it had to,"" such as sticking with plasma televisions while Samsung threw its resources into making lower-cost LCD models, Kung added. Or letting Apple and its iPod walk away with the portable music market Sony created. To be sure, Sony has taken steps toward returning to profitability. The company has also halved the amount of televisions it's projected to sell in the next year. The company bought out partner Ericsson to try to regain a footing in the smartphone market. This month, Sony partnered with Toshiba and Hitachi to create Japan Display Inc., a government-backed project to create smartphone displays. But Sony's real problem, analysts say, is the company's ability to steer its myriad businesses in the same direction. ""The number one thing is, they need a very strong control tower like Samsung and Apple,"" Kung said. ""If you want to move fast, you have a strong control tower."" Hirai acknowledged this in Thursday's press conference, saying the restructured company will be ""one Sony, one management."" Consumers and investors will wait see whether this new head of one of Japan's iconic companies can succeed where predecessors have failed. CNN's Kyung Lah and Jonathan Stayton contributed to this report .","Sony's new CEO has pledged to cut 10,000 jobs - about 6% of its workforce .

"(CNN) -- Two words, delivered with index finger punctuating the air and directed at the president of the United States, made a little-known South Carolina congressman one of the most controversial men on the Internet -- at least Wednesday heading into Thursday. Many Facebook and Twitter users condemned Rep. Joe Wilson for his outburst toward President Obama. As soon as Rep. Joe Wilson was identified as the person whose angry and audible outburst disrupted President Obama's health care speech to Congress, condemnation was swift -- and brutal. Within minutes, someone had altered Wilson's entry on the online encyclopedia Wikipedia: . ""He is a [expletive] that called the president of the United States a liar on national television and has no respect for the office he holds."" When the Web site scrubbed the sentence, an even more offensive entry wormed its way in. iReport.com: ""You are disrespectful, sir"" Soon, the site disabled edit options for Wilson's entry, chalking it up to ""vandalism."" On Twitter, post after post urged users to condemn Wilson's breach of protocol, listing his Web site address and his congressional office phone number. Web surfers who visited http://www.joewilson.house.gov/ were greeted with the message: ""This site is down for maintenance. Please check back again soon."" Those who called his office number either could not get through because the line was busy, or could not leave a message because the phone continued to ring without activating voice mail. ""If he's the face of the GOP, we'll have public option by Columbus Day!"" wrote Andisheh Nouraee, a columnist for Creative Loafing, an alternative weekly in Atlanta, Georgia. Democrats on Capitol Hill piled on the condemnation as well. ""Biggest disappointment of evening, the total lack of respect show by one member for the president,"" wrote Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri. ""Never acceptable to behave like a jerk."" As ""Joe Wilson"" trended on Twitter as the most popular conversation topic -- and on Google among the most searched terms -- the lawmaker's supporters fought back. Many set up Twitter accounts and posted their first tweets Wednesday night and early Thursday. ""You have nothing to apologize for. You should be applauded for standing up and speaking the truth,"" said Jamie Sawyer of Madison, Wisconsin. ""Good for him! Too bad he had to apologize"" was a comment on the Lonely Conservative blog. ""At last the little man found his voice tonight and called Obama what he surely is, a liar,"" said another blog, Sunlit Uplands. By early Thursday, genuine tweets about Wilson were interspersed with ads for male erectile dysfunction: ""Joe Wilson Cialis $1.9 Viagra $1.1 (Web site address)"" Though Wilson issued an apology, saying his emotions got the best of him, few online bought it.  Watch Obama react to the ""You lie!"" outburst » . On the Internet, where speculation runs rife, tweeters pointed to a comment Wilson posted on Labor Day as evidence that his outburst was planned: . ""Happy Labor Day! Wonderful parade at Chapin, many people called out to oppose Obamacare which I assured them would be relayed tomorrow to DC,"" the tweet from Wilson's account said. On Facebook, where users aren't impeded by Twitter's 140-character limitation, a prolonged and nasty war of words dominated Wilson's page. ""I have no problem being called a liberal hack by illogical, fear filled, unintelligent people. and actually, I will take it as a complement,"" wrote Janine Feczko. Name-calling was met by ad hominem attacks: ""Janine, I'm sure in the trailer park where you live they gush over your incredible intellect and witty commentary. After all that toothless grin and tripple chin screams Harvard Law,"" wrote Dan Colgan. Nine hundred and 10 comments later, the battle raged on early Thursday. Amid all this, the campaign of Democrat Rob Miller, who hopes to unseat the Republican Wilson in next year's midterm elections, raked in the dough: more than $200,000 from 5,000 individuals overnight and Thursday morning after Obama's speech, according to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Finally, there were those who found humor in Wilson's heckle. A hastily created Web site, JoeWilsonIsYourPreExistingCondition, hurled a new insult at the politician with every click of the refresh button. ""Joe Wilson poured salt on your lawn,"" said one. Refresh. ""Joe Wilson traded the dead batteries in walkman for the fresh ones in your TV remote."" Refresh. ""Joe Wilson yells 'Freebird' at concerts."" Not everyone, however, was busy assigning blame to Wilson. Los Angeles actor and comic Paul Scheer decided to shoulder it. ""I apologize 4 yelling 'liar' during Obama's speech,"" he jokingly wrote. ""Sen McCain ate my Kit Kat while I was in the bathroom & he pretended like he didn't.""","Little-known South Carolina congressman shouts, ""You lie!"" at President Obama .

"(CNN) -- If your New Year's resolutions have lasted this long, congratulations. You're 1/366th of the way home. But it's not too late to throw a few more on the pile. And since half of us spend an hour or more online every day, according to the Pew Research Center's Internet and American Life Project, it's worth considering a few Web resolutions to go along with those vows to drop some pounds or put down the smokes. Here are a few suggestions for digital behaviors you might want to resolve to drop in 2012. You can feel better about yourself while making the Web a happier place. Even this guy. Copy-and-pasted Facebook statuses . Guess what? We can pretty much promise that even more than 97% of us won't copy and paste the Facebook status update that you copied and pasted from someone else (who, in turn, predicted that 97% of people wouldn't copy and paste it). First, some math. If 97% of Facebook's purported 800 million users don't copy and paste your status, that means that 24 million people will. Congratulations -- you just created one of the most popular things ever on Facebook. Seriously. Feel strongly about a cause? Write your thoughts about it. Once we've seen the same thing five or 10 times, we'll stop being sympathetic even if you're taking a stand against the cudgeling of baby seals or something. And the ones that claim to share some tidbit of shocking information? The vast majority are bunk. We'd say about 97% of them. Mangling the English language on Twitter . We get that Twitter is meant to be quick. And that sometimes you have to tighten up the spelling to get your words of wisdom down to 140 characters or less. But for the love of Bieber (16 million followers), take five seconds to get ""it's"" and ""its"" or ""they're,"" ""there"" and ""their"" right. You'll probably hold onto more followers in the new year if your tweets don't hurt their brains. And, if you're a celebrity, take the time to avoid reminding us that your clever dialogue came from a screenwriter or those meaningful lyrics were penned for you by a songwriter. Lame online comments . We get it. When you combine ""people"" and ""sheep,"" you get ""sheeple."" And, at some point, somebody probably felt proud of the new portmanteau he dreamed up to insult folks on the Web whose opinions differed from his own. (Pardon the pronoun ... but you know it was a guy.) Look ... the Internet gives us the ability to communicate in real time with people we've never met, all over the world. Is ""This is Obama's fault"" -- on a news story about a lost kitten -- really the best we can do? And don't get us started on ""First!"" We'd love to see online commenting take a step forward in 2012 and have people shoot for the kind of conversations we'd like to have if we were all sitting together over a cup of coffee or cold beer. But we'd settle for not seeing ""LULZ"" used as a noun. (Note: We're well aware this item guarantees that all the bad behavior we just mentioned will now appear in the comments below. Go for it if you must -- just don't think we didn't see it coming.) Inviting Internet karma . Do you run an online business? Are you hoping to get elected? Heck ... do you do just about anything that involves dealing with other human beings? Then don't be a jerk. It will just make the watchdogs of the Internet have to waste time taking you to the digital woodshed. Remember the customer service rep who recently told a customer whose video-game controller order had been repeatedly delayed to ""grow up""? (The rep also helpfully called him a ""complete moron."") The guy was fired after sites such as Penny Arcade got their hands on the e-mail chain. Did your airline break a musician's guitar? Pay him for it, or he'll write a catchy country song and post it on YouTube, where 11 million people will see it. Want to charge your customers $2 just to make their payments online (the quickest, most environmentally friendly and easiest-to-process way)? They'll hound you online so mercilessly that you'll have to change your mind the next day. Yes, Verizon, we're looking at you. We've got this great big tool to tell lots of folks about your wrongdoings really fast. So resolve to be nice. Or you will pay. Smartphone misbehavior . Just because your phone lets you get on the Internet doesn't mean you have to tweet -- or heaven forbid, make a call -- on the toilet. You don't have to bury your face in Words With Friends while you're walking down the hall, putting us both at risk of a collision and concussion. We get it. Boy, do we ever get it. Those super-computers in our pockets are alluring in a way that not much technology has ever been. We get hooked ourselves sometimes. But you can put your phone away once in a while. If you try hard, you can make it through 2012 without texting in front of us in the movie theater or while weaving through rush-hour traffic. And while we're at it, here's a tip for you Apple employees: Try to get through 2012 without leaving any iPhone 5 prototypes in bars. Really, you can do it.","In 2012, resolve to kill off these bad behaviors on the Web .
That copy-and-pasted Facebook status? Try writing your own instead .
Avoid bad Twitter spelling and comment-section trolling .
Deal with the public? Treat people well, or the Internet watchdogs will not be pleased ."
"(EW.com) -- This Saturday night, while you're watching John Cusack brood in ""The Raven"" or catching up on ""Game of Thrones"" -- or doing something besides staring at a glowing rectangle -- a certain flame-haired actress will be dining with America's commander-in-chief. That's right: Lindsay Lohan, newly minted Lifetime movie star, will attend 2012′s White House Correspondents' dinner. Her rep tells the Washington Post that Lilo is going to be a guest of Fox News host Greta van Susteren, who must be a closet fan of ""I Know Who Killed Me."" And to make matters even odder, Lohan's defense attorney Shawn Holley will also be present at the soiree. I guess that'll come in handy if another lady accuses her of battery afterward. It's bizarre that Lohan's going to rub elbows with Barack, Michelle, and a roster of Beltway insiders and Hollywood A-listers at the event. But ever since famous residents of the Left Coast started attending the WHCD in greater numbers, the event's guest list has included more than a few head scratchers. For example: . - In 2002, bat-biter Ozzy Osbourne attended and evidently stole the show from then-president George W. Bush. (Hey, remember when The Osbournes was a thing?) Bush tried to get the last laugh by telling Osbourne that Barbara Bush was a big fan of albums like ""Sabbath Bloody Sabbath."" - 2006 welcomed ""Dancing With the Stars"" winner Drew Lachey and tennis siren Anna Kournikova, among others. But I'm guessing nobody had time to wonder why these C-listers were in the building; guests must have been too busy gaping at Stephen Colbert's explosive speech. - 2008: Heidi Montag got an invite, but had to cancel when human sweat stain Spencer Pratt demanded a ticket as well. What a loss for Washington! - David Cross showed up in 2009 and allegedly snorted cocaine in front of President Obama. Which decision was worse: doing drugs while surrounded by Secret Service agents or appearing in ""Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel?"" - 2010 was a banner year for unlikely WHCD attendees. The Jonas Brothers, Chace Crawford's sister Candice, Katie Lee Joel (Billy's ex-wife), and Q-list syndicated talk show host Wendy Williams all came. Oh, and so did Kim Kardashian; like Lilo, she was a guest of van Susteren. (So, in fact, was Ozzy Osbourne. I'm shocked she didn't try to bring Charlie Sheen in 2011.) - This year, Lindsay may be upstaged by another headline-grabbing guest: Uggie, The Artist's adorable, heroic Jack Russell Terrier. He'll be a guest of The Washington Times, a paper that knows from dog puns. How do you think Lilo compares to those who have come before her? And what do you think she'll do at the Correspondents' Dinner -- accidentally flash her Mean Girl? Pick a fight with Jesse Tyler Ferguson, a repeat attendee?

"Milan, Italy (CNN) -- The judge in Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's trial on charges of sex with a minor rejected all defense motions Monday and scheduled the next hearing for October 3. Judge Giulia Turri dismissed defense motions one by one in a hearing attended by neither Berlusconi nor the woman at the center of the accusations, dancer Karima el Mahroug --  nicknamed ""Ruby the Heart-stealer."" Berlusconi's attorney, Niccolo Ghedini, slammed Turri.  ""It is shameful.  It is a ruling without any logic,"" he complained to reporters after the proceedings.  ""It is not possible to hold a fair trial here.  The judge rejected all of 16 objections. How is this possible?"" Berlusconi also faced a second hearing Monday in another case involving accusations of corruption. It was the first time he has had hearings in both cases on the same day. He's drawn the most international attention for the headline-grabbing allegations that he paid for sex with the dancer, and then tried to pull strings to get her out of jail when she was arrested for theft. It's illegal to pay for sex with a minor in Italy. Both the prime minister and the dancer admit he gave her money, but deny it was for sex. Separately, he is also fighting charges of bribing British lawyer David Mills to secure favorable testimony in legal cases. Mills denied receiving bribes and his conviction in the case was overturned last year. Mills is the ex-husband of former British government minister Tessa Jowell. The Mills case has been in and out of court for years. Berlusconi at one point passed a law shielding top government officials from prosecution while they're in office, and then saw it struck down by judges. Berlusconi denies all charges. The court adjourned the Mills case until September 19. Berlusconi did not appear at the Ruby trial on Monday.  Ghedini said the prime minister ""had other institutional commitments."" Berlusconi's political fortunes have been mixed in the face of the trials. His ruling coalition suffered a major defeat in local elections in Milan and Naples at the end of May, with voters backing left-wing candidates in both cities. Milan's turn to the left is a powerful setback for Berlusconi. Milan is his hometown and his political stronghold, and it has been led by a center-right mayor for the past two decades . But less than a month later, Italian lawmakers approved a vote of confidence for his economic reform package. Lawmakers in the lower house of parliament approved the package in a 317-293 vote on June 21. The measure -- which aims to boost growth in Italy, particularly in the southern regions -- wasn't a vote of confidence on the Berlusconi government but only on the reform package itself. But the vote showed that Berlusconi has a stronger majority in the lower house than his critics thought. CNN's Hada Messia and Diana Magnay contributed to this report.","NEW: Italian PM Berlusconi's attorney calls the judge's actions ""shameful""

"(CNN) -- U.S. diplomats met with the Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Thursday in another sign of thawing relations between Washington and the Southeast Asian nation. Derek Mitchell, the U.S. special envoy to Myanmar, and Luis CdeBaca, the U.S. ambassador-at-large for human trafficking, held talks with Suu Kyi at her residence. The U.S. delegation arrived in the country Monday and has meet with top government officials. The meetings also coincides with an announcement by government officials that Myanmar has begun peace talks with a major rebel group, signing a cease fire with the Karen National Liberation Army. Myanmar signs ceasefire deal . Myanmar has been ruled by a military junta since 1962, and the generals have started to loosen their grip on the country after coming under criticism for their human rights record in recent years. Thein Sein, a former military official and prime minister, became president last year as a result of an election criticized by democracy activists as a sham. Myanmar authorities released Suu Kyi in 2010 after years of house arrest and then freed dozens of political prisoners in October 2011. Last week, she met with William Hague, the first British foreign secretary to visit Myanmar in more than 50 years. Burma was a part of British India from 1886 until gaining its independence in 1948. Since 1989, the ruling military has said the nation should be called Myanmar, but some Western nations still refer to it as Burma.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Monday appeared to call out Mitt Romney over what he said about going after Osama bin Laden on the campaign trail four years ago, as opposed to on the eve of the first anniversary of the raid that killed the terrorist leader. Asked about Romney's comments earlier in the day that the decision to go after bin Laden was a clear one and that ""even Jimmy Carter would"" have made the call, Obama referred to a difference between what Romney said during his 2008 presidential campaign and on the eve of the first anniversary of the attack. ""I assume that people meant what they said when they said it,"" Obama said during a joint appearance with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda. ""That's been at least my practice. I said that I'd go after bin Laden if we had a clear shot at him, and I did. If there are others who said one thing and now suggest they'd do something else, I'd go ahead and let them explain."" Obama also appeared to take exception with a reporter's question that suggested there was excessive celebration around the anniversary of the al Qaeda leader's death, repeating a charge that Republicans have made. ""I hardly think that you've seen any excessive celebration taking place,"" Obama said. ""I think that the American people likely remember what we as a country accomplished in bringing to justice somebody who killed over 3,000 of our citizens."" Romney's spokeswoman, Andrea Saul, responded in a statement that Obama was using the anniversary of bin Laden's death as ""a cheap political ploy"" that she said distorted Romney's policies on fighting terrorism. ""While the Obama administration has naively stated that 'the war on terror is over,' Gov. Romney has always understood we need a comprehensive plan to deal with the myriad threats America faces,"" Saul said. U.S. Navy SEALs killed bin Laden on May 2, 2011 during a raid in Pakistan. The war of words around the bin Laden death anniversary started last week when Obama's campaign made it an issue in a Web ad that questioned whether Romney would make the same call in the Oval Office. Former President Bill Clinton narrates parts of the video, in which he praises Obama's decision to order the attack. It also points out Romney saying in 2007 that, ""It's not worth moving heaven and earth, spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person."" Days later, he said, ""We'll move everything to get him (bin Laden)."" Asked by a reporter at an event Monday morning whether he would have made the call, Romney said ""of course"" he would have. ""Even Jimmy Carter would have given that order."" Surrogates took up the argument over the bin Laden raid on the Sunday talk shows. Senior Obama campaign adviser Robert Gibbs defended the campaign, while senior Romney adviser Ed Gillespie characterized it as a ""bridge too far."" Gibbs, the former White House press secretary, said the video was ""not over the line"" and criticized comments Romney made on the issue during his first White House bid as ""foolish."" ""There's a difference in the roles they would play as commander in chief, and I certainly think that's fair game,"" Gibbs said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" Gillespie, a former aide to President George W. Bush and former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said using the raid for political purposes is one of the reasons Obama has ""become one of the most divisive presidents in American history."" ""He took something that was a unifying event for all Americans, and he's managed to turn it into a divisive, partisan political attack,"" Gillespie said in a separate interview on the same NBC program. ""I think most Americans will see it as a sign of a desperate campaign."" The day Osama bin Laden died . Arizona Sen. John McCain, Obama's 2008 opponent, called the minute-long spot ""a cheap political attack ad."" White House counterterrorism adviser John Brennan avoided politics and praised the president's decision-making skills on the talk shows and in an address Monday at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. ""One year ago today, President Obama faced the scenario that he discussed here at the Wilson Center five years ago, and he did not hesitate to act,"" he said. ""The death of bin Laden was our most strategic blow yet against al Qaeda,"" Brennan said. ""Credit for that success belongs to the courageous forces who carried out that mission, at extraordinary risk to their lives; to the many intelligence professionals who pieced together the clues that led to bin Laden's hideout; and to President Obama, who gave the order to go in."" Vice President Joe Biden previewed the theme in a Thursday campaign-style address. ""If you are looking for a bumper sticker to sum up how President Obama has handled what we inherited, it's pretty simple: Osama bin Laden is dead, and General Motors is alive,"" he said during a speech at New York University. Clinton appeared in a fundraiser with Obama on Sunday night, characterizing Romney as ""an opponent who basically wants to do what they did before -- on steroids. Which will get you the same consequences you got before -- on steroids."" Obama will pick up the message with what the campaign has billed as his re-election kick-off Saturday. He is expected to attend campaign rallies in Columbus, Ohio, and Richmond, Virginia, two likely battleground states in the November election. He cited Ronald Reagan on Monday as he rallied building trade union members, trying to draw a distinction between the conservative icon and the Republican Party that the president is running against now. ""Ronald Reagan once said that rebuilding our infrastructure is common sense; an investment in tomorrow that we need to make today,"" Obama told the Building and Construction Trades Department Legislative Conference. ""Ronald Reagan said that -- that great socialist Ronald Reagan said that. Couldn't get through a Republican primary these days."" Biden will attend campaign events in Missouri and Indiana on Monday and in Washington on Thursday. Obama's campaign manager, Jim Messina, said that Saturday will mark the end of the Republican ""monologue."" Romney's campaign, meanwhile, announced that its candidate will mark the anniversary of the bin Laden raid in an event with former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who was dubbed ""America's mayor"" for his response in the days after bin Laden's 9/11 attacks against the U.S. Romney's Jimmy Carter comments came at an event in New Hampshire with Sen. Kelly Ayotte, another of those believed to be on Romney's vice president candidate search list. The freshman senator was an early backer of Romney's and appeared with him repeatedly on the stump ahead of her state's primary. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida got the VP scrutiny treatment last week when he appeared with Romney in Pennsylvania. Many political observers see Rubio as the favorite for Romney's vice presidential pick, given his ties to the swing state of Florida, the Hispanic community (he is the son of Cuban immigrants) and members of the grassroots tea party movement. Rubio was one of three potential candidates mentioned by House Speaker John Boehner in an interview that aired Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Boehner said there is a ""long list"" of qualified candidates for the GOP ticket, including Rubio, Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio and Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana, all of whom fit his criteria that the pick be capable of serving as president. Romney will spend much of the coming week fundraising, with events in Pennsylvania and Virginia. He is expected to meet with former Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum on Friday, a long-awaited rendezvous, given that the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania has yet to endorse his party's presumptive nominee. Santorum danced around the issue last week with CNN's Piers Morgan during his first televised interview since he suspended his candidacy on April 10. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich is expected to announce the suspension of his campaign Wednesday, at which point he will back Romney, sources told CNN.","Obama seems to call out Romney on what he has said about bin Laden .

"(CNN) -- Myanmar announced Tuesday it will grant amnesty to 6,300 prisoners on Wednesday, one in a series of recent moves that could help the isolated nation normalize relations with Western nations including the United States. But is it really an authentic step toward greater freedoms in one of the world's most repressive states? Or is it another gesture by the nominally civilian government to appease critics? Kurt Campbell, a U.S. assistant secretary of state, called it a ""dramatic development"" that could prompt Washington to consider improving ties. The United States imposes an embargo on arms and investment in Myanmar, once known as Burma before a military junta took over. But if you ask Mark Farmaner, director of the London-based human rights group Burma Campaign UK, the prisoner amnesty is part of the ""mood music"" created to soothe the world. Obviously, he said, the amnesty was welcome, but it was hardly signaling the government's wish for democracy. ""What's very clear is that (President) Thein Sein is willing to make more concessions in order to get sanctions lifted and get more international legitimacy,"" Farmaner said. The amnesty announcement in state-run media did not make it clear how many political detainees would be included. Amnesty International has reported that more than 2,200 political prisoners are detained in poor conditions and subjected to torture and cruel treatment. Their release remains a key demand of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and a priority for lifting of Western sanctions. There was cause for optimism after a letter to Thein Sein from a new state-appointed human rights panel called for the pardon of ""prisoners of conscience who do not pose a threat to the stability of state and public tranquility."" Myanmar, ruled by generals since 1962, denied for decades that political prisoners even existed. Since Myanmar's elections in November 2010 -- the first in two decades -- its leaders have been gingerly reaching out to critics. ""Now I think it would be fair to say the elections themselves were flawed in many critical ways, and we have continuing concerns about a number of developments inside the country,"" Campbell, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said Monday in a lecture in Bangkok, Thailand. ""But it is also undeniably the case that there are dramatic developments under way,"" he said. ""We have stated clearly that we are prepared for a new chapter in our relations, and we are watching carefully developments on the ground. And I think it would be fair to say we will match their steps with comparable steps, and we are looking forward over the course of the next several weeks to continuing a dialogue that has really stepped up in recent months."" Tint Swe, the head of Myanmar's state censorship, called Friday for greater press freedoms, saying his own office should be shuttered as part of government reforms, reported Radio Free Asia. Last week, the government suspended the Myitsone dam project on the Irrawaddy River -- annoying the Chinese but pleasing Suu Kyi and environmental activists, who had been vocal opponents. In September, Myanmar's Foreign Minister Wunna Maung Lwin held a rare, historic meeting with U.S. officials in Washington following what a U.S. State Department spokesman characterized as positive developments after years of discord over human rights and other issues. A month earlier, Suu Kyi met with Thein Sein at the presidential residence in Naypyitaw and the two vowed to work together in the nation's interest, state media reported. Nyan Win, a spokesman for Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party, said then that he thought the meeting ""may be the first step towards reconciliation."" The NLD was banned from the 2010 election, but Suu Kyi is fighting to restore her party's legitimacy. Myanmar and Western nations have been at odds for years because of Myanmar rulers' ongoing clampdown on their political foes, most notably Suu Kyi. She spent most of the past two decades in some form of detention before being released a week after last year's elections. Farmaner of Burma Campaign UK said the government's talks with Suu Kyi are also about self-preservation. As long as there are popular protests, the government runs the risk of having to crack down on a growing movement as it did in 2007, when outrage over rising fuel prices escalated to Buddhist monks leading 100,000 people in the largest anti-government demonstrations since 1988. ""He wants to take politics off the streets of Burma and bring it under the parliament's wing,"" Farmaner said about Thein Sein. ""He is scared of it being on the streets."" Joshua Kurlantzick, fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, admitted he was a bit wary about the intentions of a government that in the past has failed implement reforms. However, he said he is taken with the scope of the latest developments. ""Given that, this reform has definitely gone beyond what a lot of skeptics expected, including myself,' Kurlantzick said. A longtime pariah nation, Myanmar, he said, likely wants international recognition. ""It's important to them,"" Kurlantzick said. ""It's about diversifying their partners,"" he said. ""They don't want to be totally reliant on China. It's about not being dependent."" But a key issue that is not being addressed, said Farmaner, is rights for Myanmar's ethnic minorities, some of whom have waged armed insurgencies against the government. Until they are included in dialogue, he said, Myanmar cannot make progress. Ultimately, Farmaner has a warning for Western nations: Don't get carried away. Lift some sanctions if you want to send a message of encouragement, he said. ""But don't give away too much, too soon.""

"(CNN) -- Mali and Ghana are through to the semifinals of the Africa Cup of Nations after both achieved hard-fought quarterfinal victories on Sunday. Barcelona midfielder Seydou Keita scored the winning spot-kick for Mali as they defeated co-hosts Gabon 5-4 on penalties after the match finished 1-1 after 120 minutes in Libreville. Meanwhile, an extra time winner from Andre Ayew proved enough for World Cup quarterfinalists Ghana to edge past Tunisia 2-1 in the second match in Franceville. Mali will now face Ivory Coast in the last four, while a semifinal showdown with Zambia now awaits Ghana. Gabon looked on course to reach the last four for the first time in their history when Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang set up Eric Mouloungui for a 55th minute opener. And the scoreline remained that way until six minutes from time when Bordeaux striker Cheick Diabate turned and fired home an equalizer for Mali. With both sides scoring their first four penalties, Gabon's star player Aubameyang saw his spot-kick saved by Mali keeper Soumaila Diakite, leaving Keita to coolly slot home for Mali. Ghana continued their march towards a fifth Africa Cup of Nations title by seeing off a Tunisian side that ended the match with 10 men. Captain John Mensah opened the scoring for Ghana in the 10th minute, when he headed home a left-wing corner. Tunisia leveled three minutes before the break when Evian striker Sabeur Khalifa bravely headed in Zouhaier Dhaouadi's teasing cross from the right. But Ghana secured the victory after 101 minutes when Tunisia goalkeeper Aymen Mathlouthi dropped a harmless-looking cross for Ayew to roll home from five yards out. And Tunisia's hopes of getting back into the game were effectively ended when Aymen Abdennour was sent off for elbowing Ayew.","Mali and Ghana are through to the semifinals of the Africa Cup of Nations .

"(CNN) -- The knock on the door is a sign of bad things to come. ""Do you have any work?"" they ask. They have fled their villages and come into the city out of desperation. Their bellies ache from hunger. ""For those of us in the city, we are seeing the first signs of food crisis spreading across our country. We have seen it before. It has already started, and it is coming fast."" That's what Haoua Lankoande, a manager with the humanitarian agency CARE wrote in a recent blog post from the Niger capital, Niamey. The first phase of hunger drives villagers into the city; the second phase brings knocks on the door, Lankoande wrote. ""Do you have any food?"" they ask. ""I haven't eaten in three days."" Eventually in phase three, Lankoande said, people don't ask anymore. ""You wake up and go outside in the morning, and there is a family sleeping on your doorstep. They don't ask for anything, they just look up at you, hoping."" CARE and other aid agencies fear Niger is already in the first stage of crisis. It doesn't take long, they say, for the situation to deteriorate from phase one to three. ""What we are seeing is a tip of the iceberg,"" said Cassandra Nelson, spokeswoman for Mercy Corps. Nearly half of Niger does not have enough to eat. The 5.4 million people struggling to stay alive are part of a wider crisis affecting at least 10 million people across the swath across Africa that borders the Sahara, known as the Sahel. This is the third time in the last decade the people of the Sahel have faced severe food shortages. The problem, caused by drought and high food prices, is exacerbated by an ongoing conflict in Mali between the military and Tuareg rebels that has forced people to flee into neighboring nations. Niger, Mali, Chad, Burkina Faso and Mauritania are all facing hunger. All five governments have declared states of emergency. In Niger, people depend on crops and livestock for survival. They are used to living life on the edge. Every year, life is a gamble. In the dry months, they prepare for what is known as the ""lean season."" They eat once a day or maybe even once every 36 hours. Typically, said Nelson of Mercy Corps, the lean season begins in May. This year, it has already arrived. Premature and deadly. This week, a United Nations delegation arrived in Niger to size up the horrific situation. ""We know what is coming, and we know what to do to save lives,"" said Valerie Amos, the U.N. emergency relief coordinator. ""While we cannot stop this crisis from taking place, we are taking steps to avert a catastrophe."" Amos said international aid agencies have called for about $725 million to respond to the crisis. Donors so far have provided $135 million. ""But we need more resources now to prevent a large-scale crisis,"" she said. In the hard-hit Filengue region, the images are stark. A woman with skin as black as her dress is white surrounded by shades of parched earth. Around her, rows of millet and sorghum that no amount of water could save now. The rains came late and locusts and crickets damaged crops. The next harvest isn't until October. People grow more desperate by the day, Nelson said. A bridge stands over a river of crevices. People dig up the river bed, hunting for the last few drops of water. They rely now on God and authorities, one man told the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP). The agency said it has enough emergency food in the area to feed 2 million people in the Sahel for a month. It hopes to reach 8 million people in the coming months. Dije Ousmana told CARE she tries not to think of the three babies she has lost in previous years when food was hard to come by. But she is seeing all the wretched symptoms of hunger again in 2-month-old Abdulahadi, wailing to be fed. She put her baby to her breast but there is no milk, she told CARE. ""I haven't eaten yet today."" CNN's Joseph Netto contributed to this report.","Aid agencies fear the situation will deteriorate rapidly .

"(CNN) -- Is the Colombia prostitution scandal rocking the Secret Service an isolated incident? Or is it evidence of a debauched organizational culture that permeates the entire agency when its agents are out of the country and don't think anyone is watching? This is the question that has been on everyone's mind as word leaked out last week about a similar incident involving the Secret Service and some military personnel in El Salvador before President Barack Obama's trip there in March. On Thursday, an unnamed source told the Washington Post that such behavior was part of the Secret Service culture. The implications are serious indeed. Paying prostitutes for sex is, of course, sordid, immoral and pretty embarrassing in and of itself. However, if in fact the men in the agency charged with protecting the president and other important government officials when they are abroad have a history of cavorting with prostitutes -- in a culture that says it's OK -- the problem goes way beyond embarrassment. This whole business may be news to the American public, but if it is really part of the culture it isn't news to those who wish us harm. In the decade since the September 11 attacks, we have come to understand that the shady world of terror is inextricably bound up with the shady world of illegal activity. How many ""prostitutes"" are also foreign agents or terrorist operatives? How many others are simply willing to make money, first by selling themselves and then by selling whatever they find in the bedrooms of American government personnel to someone who is up to no good? This is not a problem that can be solved by the passage of new laws or by moving the boxes around on an organization chart. Even the swift action taken to remove the offenders from their jobs, and to revoke the security clearances of others will not offer much of a deterrent once memories of the scandal fade and some new outrage surfaces to dominate the news. Ordinarily, changing an organization's culture is pretty hard work. But when the culture in need of change is a macho culture where good old-fashioned debauchery and ""boys being boys"" is OK as long as no one gets caught -- the solution is pretty straightforward: Hire more women. Isn't it funny how having to work alongside a woman who, for instance, knows your wife -- seems to inhibit old fashioned male fun? We've seen this before. Tales from the 1960 presidential campaign plane can be summarized by the motto: ""Wheels up, rings off!"" (As in wedding rings.) From the candidate on down, the inhabitants of the hard-drinking, virtually all-male world of politicians, and the reporters who wrote about them, covered for each other and kept things private for years. Today's campaign plane has been cleaned up a lot -- from the candidates to the reporters -- and the most important reason is that there are now a fair number of women on the plane, as both advisers with real power and reporters with real power. Can you imagine the kind of debauchery that was standard operating procedure 50 years ago being tolerated by Beth Meyers, the influential, longtime aide to Mitt Romney who has the important job of heading his vice presidential search? Years ago the only women around were young women with no power. They were often the victims of a bad culture. Today there are middle-aged women with real power. They are not victims of the all male culture -- they change it. I know this has happened in politics, I saw it myself coming into the business at the end of the old era. And I suspect it has happened in other professions, as well. Do advertising executives still woo clients with multiple martinis and high-class call girls, a la ""Mad Men""? Maybe. But I suspect the presence of lot of powerful women in that business has reduced the overall level of debauchery. If there does turn out to be a culture of debauchery in the Secret Service, it will not come as a surprise. After all, the ""protection professions,"" if you will -- Secret Service, police, military -- are among the last professions to be overwhelmingly male. And yet, as we've seen in the military, when technology takes over from muscle, women start to do the same things as men. In the workplace they begin to go where only men used to go. And outside of the workplace? Well, it's hard to imagine an organization where the women head out to a brothel together. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Elaine Kamarck.","Elaine Kamarck: Allegations of debauchery in Secret Service have serious implications .

"(Budget Travel) -- Perhaps they're not the first place you think of when it comes to wineries, but these four regions offer character and great wine, without the hoopla. Stone Hill Winery is set high on the bluffs overlooking the Missouri River. Walla Walla Valley, Washington . In the mid-90s when oenophiles started to buzz about the region's Bordeaux-style wines, there were 10 wineries in Walla Walla. Today, there are more than 100, mostly accessible from Highway 12. With wine comes food, and gourmands like Alexa Palmer and Charles Maddrey have been pouring into town in the past decade. Two years ago, Palmer and Maddrey left their jobs as owner and chef, respectively, of an Italian restaurant in Renton, Washington, to open the Fat Duck Inn in the heart of Walla Walla. Each of the four guest rooms at their renovated Craftsman-style bungalow has a fireplace and a large tiled bathroom, and Maddrey can pack box lunches of gourmet charcuterie and cheeses, sandwiches, fruit, and dessert for picnics (fatduckinn.com, rooms from $125, lunch $13). Palmer recommends enjoying them on the outdoor patio near the bocce ball courts at Cougar Crest Estate Winery, west of town on Highway 12 (cougarcrestwinery.com, tasting $5, refundable with wine bottle purchase). Budget Travel: See the four unexpected wine trails . The highway takes you back toward downtown Walla Walla, a preserved 19th-century Western town, where food options range from a burrito stuffed with beef, cheese, and local sweet onions at the Tacos La Monarca truck (509/522-2866, $5), to Turkish flatbread wrapped around spiced lamb and topped with yogurt sauce at Saffron Mediterranean Kitchen, whose chef was recently a semifinalist for a James Beard Award (saffronmediterraneankitchen.com, $13). Highway 12 continues east toward K Vintners, a converted farm shed with a capital K painted on its front and a 12-foot cement statue of the letter by the entrance. Here, former band manager Charles Smith blasts music by the Raveonettes and the Ramones -- both personal friends -- and serves his signature K Syrah in honor of his favorite toast: Que sera (kvintners.com, tastings free, by appointment). -- Alison Rohrs . Anderson Valley, California . Twisting from Cloverdale, California, to the Pacific Ocean, a 16-mile portion of Highway 128 passes through the organic apple orchards, olive groves, and redwood forests of Anderson Valley. Some of the more than 20 vineyards along the way supply pinot noir grapes for famous wineries in Napa and Sonoma, but you can taste similar vintages at the farm-style Anderson wineries -- minus the popped-collar crowds. Navarro Vineyards lets babydoll sheep (too petite to reach the fruit) graze under the vines, and free-range chickens wander the vineyards to help keep pests under control. Daily tours of the grounds and tastings of the star wines -- pinot noir and dry Alsatian-style whites -- are both free (navarrovineyards.com). About 10 miles northwest along the highway, gewürztraminer grapes thrive in the rich soil and foggy mornings at Lazy Creek Vineyards. Longtime owners of Sonoma's Ferrari-Carano Vineyards and Winery, Don and Rhonda Carano, acquired the rural estate last year (lazycreekvineyards.com, tastings free). Nearby, Husch Vineyards -- the oldest in the valley, and owned by the Oswald family -- has 10 picnic tables: some in the sun, some sheltered under vine-covered pergolas. Past an arch of roses, the family pours complimentary samples of sauvignon blanc and pinot noir in a century-old redwood tasting room (huschvineyards.com). Like their neighbors to the north, Bob and Linda Klein also run a vineyard and farm at LindaVista Bed & Breakfast in Yorkville (a separate wine region in the Anderson Valley). Each of the two huge suites in their 6,000-square-foot French Victorian-style inn comes with a queen-size bed, a separate sitting room with a daybed and trundle, a full bath, and mountain views (lindavista.com, $150). Along the route, you can stop for one of 60 varieties of apples at Gowan's Oak Tree, on an orchard just north of Philo (707/895-3353). -- Alison Rohrs . Between Hermann and New Haven, Missouri . What the Hermann Wine Trail (hermannwinetrail.com) lacks in size -- there are only six wineries along the 20-mile stretch -- it makes up for in experience. The region has been producing vintages since the 1840s, before Napa had produced a single bottle. The Captain Wohlt Inn makes an ideal home base -- and not just because it's in the center of Hermann's adorable historic district. The breakfasts of upside-down apple French toast, three-cheese quiche, or baked eggs with turkey bacon and herbs are exactly what you need to prepare you for a day of sampling wines (captainwohltinn.com, from $75). Less than a mile away, the family-run Adam Puchta Winery gives free tastings in the estate's original stone house with wood-beamed ceilings. For many of the 16-18 wines, you'll get a bite of something to help you identify the flavors. A Key-lime shortbread cookie brings out the fruit flavors in the vignoles, a sweet white wine, and a piece of chocolate softens the tannins in the dry red Norton (adampuchtawine.com). The picnic tables on the grounds make the perfect lunch spot, so on the way to the winery, stop at husband-and-wife-owned Time for Pie to pick up some bratwurst sandwiches and one of the 15 kinds of homemade pie (time4pie.com, pie $3 per slice). Two and a half miles down the road, Stone Hill Winery is set high on the bluffs overlooking the Missouri River -- one can imagine that the terrain reminded German settlers of their native Rhine River valley. Tours of the 162-year-old arched cellars, where wine is still stored, end in the tasting room, where you can try the chardonel, a dry, buttery white that's similar to a chardonnay, and the limited-edition vintage port. Next to the tasting room, Stone Hill's original stable is now Vintage Restaurant, where the menu ranges from hearty German specialties like schnitzel to more refined entrées like filet mignon (stonehillwinery.com, tours $2.50, tastings free).  Beth Collins . Charlottesville, Virginia . Virginia's premier wine country, dotted with working farms and over 1,000 acres of grape vines, spreads out around the city of Charlottesville in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The free tour at 20-acre Jefferson Vineyards both explores the winery and recounts the history of Virginia wine making (jeffersonvineyards.com, tasting $5). The viognier, with aromas of honeysuckle and apricot, is an ideal refresher, and from the deck at the tasting room, visitors have a view of Carters Mountain and Jefferson's home, Monticello, a mile and a half north, where a recently opened visitors center introduces guests to the founding father's life and ideas (monticello.org, from $15). Jefferson's master builder also built Dinsmore House, a B&B just a block from the University of Virginia. The decor deliberately recalls the colonial era, but the amenities -- Wi-Fi and flat-screen TVs -- are right up-to-date (dinsmorehouse.com, from $109). South of Monticello is Kluge Estate Winery and Vineyard, whose 2005 blanc de blanc has hints of candied apple and lemon custard (klugeestateonline.com, tasting $10). About 18 miles west of Charlottesville, in Crozet, King Family Vineyards occupies 15 acres on a farm where polo ponies are raised; visitors can watch polo matches for free on Sundays from Memorial Day through the end of September (kingfamilyvineyards.com, tasting $5). For a picnic at the vineyard, the Crosé, a dry rosé, pairs well with the tomato sauce on a pie from perennial favorite Crozet Pizza. Be prepared for a wait at the 32-year-old institution; some call this the best pizza in the state, and people come from miles around to combine toppings from the list of over 30 options, including zucchini, peanuts, and bacon (crozetpizza.net, from $11.50). --Thomas Berger .

"(Health.com) -- Fewer U.S. adults are smoking, and those who do smoke are on average smoking less, according to a new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Smoking rates in the U.S. have dropped dramatically over the past several decades, falling from 40% in 1965 to about 20% in 2006. Much of that decline is due to a disproportionate decrease in the number of people who smoke at least a pack a day, the study found. In 1965, 56% of all adult smokers consumed 20 cigarettes or more per day. By 2007, that figure had fallen to 41%. In California, which has a history of unusually aggressive antismoking programs, the decrease was even larger: Only 23% of all smokers smoked at least a pack a day in 2007, according to the study, which mined data from two long-running government surveys. Health.com: 15 ways smoking ruins your looks . These declines appear to be caused by a combination of heavy smokers quitting altogether and fewer young people ramping up to a pack-a-day-habit, the researchers say. The decrease in smoking rates ""is all coming out of heavy smokers,"" says John P. Pierce, Ph.D., the lead author of the study and the director of cancer prevention and control at the University of California San Diego's Moores Cancer Center. ""The population [of smokers] is changing."" The decline in heavy smoking appears to be linked to a subsequent decline in lung cancer. In 1993, when the deaths caused by lung cancer peaked in the U.S.-- about 15 years after the rates of heavy smoking peaked --1 in every 855 deaths was attributable to the cancer. By 2007, lung cancer was responsible for just 1 in every 980 deaths. (These figures do not include California, which had even lower rates.) Health.com: 6 common smoking triggers-- and how to fight them . ""We knew that lung cancer was caused almost entirely by smoking, and it's the amount you smoke that matters,"" Pierce says. ""It was always the heavier smoker that was getting lung cancer."" The findings are ""great news,"" says Norman Edelman, M.D., chief medical officer of the American Lung Association. ""This shows the dramatic effect of our smoking cessation and prevention programs. This is also a victory for public health and disease prevention agencies, which are generally poorly funded in the U.S."" The decline in heavy smoking has been especially pronounced in California, the country's most populous state. In 1965, 23% of California adults smoked 20 or more cigarettes a day, whereas only 3% smoked that heavily in 2007. Health.com: Social, sneaky, or skinny? The 7 types of smokers . The authors attribute the success in California to the state's wide-ranging antismoking efforts. The state was the first to substantially raise taxes on cigarettes, the first to institute a comprehensive antismoking program, and the first to banish smoking in workplaces statewide, the study notes. In fact, the study itself is a product of the state's antismoking efforts. The research was funded with grants from the University of California that, by law, are supported by state cigarette taxes. In addition, one of the study's coauthors, David W. Cowling, is the chief of evaluation for the California Tobacco Control Program, a division of the state department of public health whose budget is funded with the same taxes. Despite the progress seen in the study, Edelman cautions that the fight to reduce smoking is far from over. ""Twenty percent of American adults still smoke and tobacco is still causing lots of major disease,"" he says. ""We should not use this news to declare victory, but be encouraged by the success of our actions so we can vigorously press on to reduce the use of tobacco further.""

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- The younger son of political activist Aung San Suu Kyi left Myanmar Tuesday after a long-awaited visit with his mother, from whom he'd been separated for a decade. Kim Aris was seen arriving back in Bangkok, Thailand, later in the day. Aris had been in Myanmar for a little more than two weeks visiting with his mother. He last saw his Nobel Peace Laureate mother in 2000, when he spent about two weeks with her, according to one of her attorneys. Suu Kyi was released from house arrest on November 13, after spending most of the past 20 years under house arrest or in prison. Suu Kyi release came after national elections in Myanmar. Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy party boycotted the November 7 elections, faulting the country's ruling military junta. Before the election, the regime had enacted a new law that forced the Suu Kyi's party to choose between honoring her as its leader and risking the party being declared illegal, or ejecting Suu Kyi from the party and contesting the elections. Generals in Myanmar refused to allow international monitors to oversee the elections and overhauled Myanmar's constitution in a way critics say is aimed at tightening the regime's grip. The constitution now requires more than 100 military nominees in parliament. Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been under military rule since 1962.

"(Health.com) -- A class of injectable drugs used to treat autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis doesn't raise the risk of serious infection when compared with more conventional treatments, according to a new analysis in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The research, which was funded by the Food and Drug Administration and other federal health agencies, contradicts numerous earlier studies that did find an increased risk of infection associated with the drugs, known as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. The possibility that TNF inhibitors -- which include popular drugs such as Humira and Enbrel -- pose no additional infection risk is a ""very new and heretical idea,"" says David T. Felson, M.D., a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the Boston University School of Medicine, who cowrote an editorial accompanying the study. ""Up until now there has been considerable evidence that anti-TNFs heightened the risk of serious infection compared to other treatments."" Health.com: Signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis . The lead author of the study, Carlos G. Grijalva, M.D., a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University, in Nashville, Tennessee, says the findings ""should be reassuring for patients and providers."" Felson, however, says the new findings aren't sufficient to quell the concerns raised by previous studies. ""We still need to be concerned about serious infection risk among patients starting these medicines,"" he says. Autoimmune conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease, arise when the body's immune system goes awry and begins attacking healthy cells and tissue. TNF inhibitors -- known as biologic drugs, because they're derived from substances that occur naturally in humans and animals -- work by blocking the action of TNF, an important immune-system molecule. Health.com: 10 risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease . This class of drugs drastically improved the treatment of these conditions when first introduced in the late 1990s, but because they suppress the immune system they are believed to open the door to opportunistic infections. Some patients taking the drugs have died from these infections, and the FDA has been closely watching the drugs' safety profile as more and more people use them. Previous studies have found that TNF inhibitors as much as double the risk of serious infection compared with other treatment options. Those trials tended to be relatively small, however. The new study, which was presented this weekend at an annual meeting of the American College of Rheumatology, sought to address that weakness. Grijalva and his colleagues combined data on more than 32,000 mostly low-income people from four large health-care databases, including those for Medicaid and Medicare. About half of the people took TNF-inhibitors for their conditions, and the other half took older, non-biologic drugs -- such as leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, and sulfasalazine. Health.com: Got psoriasis? 7 signs you may have arthritis too . The authors identified 1,172 infections requiring hospitalization during the study period. (The most common infections were pneumonia and skin and soft-tissue infections.) After one year of treatment, people taking TNF inhibitors had no higher risk of serious infections than those taking other types of drugs. The researchers did find, however, that among patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the TNF inhibitor Remicade carried an approximately 25% higher risk of infection than Enbrel or Humira. How well are you managing your rheumatoid arthritis? Take a health test . It's not clear why Remicade might be riskier than other TNF inhibitors, but it's possible that the higher initial doses the drug requires might be partly responsible, Grijalva says. The mechanism of action may also be slightly different than that of other TNF inhibitors, he adds. The study does have an important limitation that detracts from the findings, Felson says. As he notes in his editorial, some 40% of participants taking TNF inhibitors dropped out within the first month, compared with only 15% in the comparison group. In previous trials and in clinical practice, people who stop taking TNF blockers ""tend to be older and at a higher risk of serious infections,"" Felson says. That pattern, he adds, may have skewed the study results and made TNF inhibitors look safer than they perhaps really are.

"(CNN) -- More than 55,000 cases of dengue, a sometimes deadly mosquito-borne disease, have been reported in a southeastern Brazilian state in the past four months, authorities said Thursday. The disease has killed 67 people this year in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro state, the state's ministry of health reported. Slightly less than half of the deaths were children under the age of 13, the ministry said. Brazilian authorities are calling the situation an epidemic. The ministry of health did not identify whether the deaths were attributed to the more severe form of dengue, dengue hemorrhagic fever, which ""can be fatal if unrecognized and not properly treated,"" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The CDC said that with treatment, fatalities due to dengue hemorrhagic fever, which is characterized by abnormal internal or external bleeding, can be less than 1 percent. Dengue fever, the more common form of dengue, is caused by four closely related viruses. All of them are carried by infected mosquitoes, mainly the Aedes Aegypti mosquito, the CDC said.  Watch a report on the outbreak » . It cannot be spread from person to person. The Rio de Janeiro health ministry said 513 of its 57,010 cases of dengue were that of dengue hemorrhagic fever. Rio de Janeiro Mayor Cesar Maia said that patients from outside the city are flooding the municipal hospital and that there aren't enough beds to accommodate them, Brazilian newspaper O Globo reported. The newspaper said the average hospital waits ranged from eight to 28 hours in some places. One father told O Globo, ""I am just watching my son die slowly as we knock on different hospital doors."" The state's secretary of health, Sergio Luiz Cortes da Silveira, acknowledged, ""We don't have enough hospitals for these patients."" He said the state was appealing for help from pediatricians elsewhere in the country.  Watch ill Brazilians being cared for » . Earlier this week, the country's health minister, Jose Gomes Temporao, said that 2,000 people, including members of the Ministry of Health and the military, were working to combat the Aedes Aegypti mosquito, the government reported on its Web site. At least part of this work, he said, included going door-to-door to inform people of where the mosquitos live. ""Without the mosquito, dengue does not exist,"" he said, according to the government. The CDC estimates that there are 10 million cases of dengue around the world each year. ""It actually is quite common,"" said Dr. Ali Khan of the CDC.  Watch Khan discuss dengue and its prevention » . Mosquitoes carrying dengue viruses breed in stored, exposed water, including places as shallow as jars, discarded bottles and plant saucers, according to the World Health Organization. Khan emphasized prevention. ""Wear long sleeves, loose, baggy pants and make sure you're using good insect repellent."" Symptoms of dengue fever include high fever, severe headache, backache, joint pains and eye pain, nausea, vomiting and a rash, according to the CDC.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- If you're a comedy fan, you've probably heard of him by now. Comedian Brian Regan, 50, is famous for his clean jokes about everyday life. He is on tour. Famous for his clean jokes about everyday life, comedian Brian Regan is at the peak of his career, gaining new followers with every performance. On a recent Saturday night, he dazzled a sold-out audience of more than 2,000 people near Atlanta as part of his 2009 comedy tour. The easygoing 50-year-old comedian with a boyish smile and energetic presence pranced back and forth across the stage Saturday telling jokes that brought laughter to issues both serious and silly -- from the stressful economy to the quirks of text messaging. Regan, a Miami, Florida, native, has been performing stand-up comedy since 1980 by starting at small venues and comedy clubs. His breakthrough came in the late 1990s after the release of his album ""Brian Regan Live,"" which sold 150,000 copies despite the comedian's relative obscurity at the time. The album featured simple routines that made fun of childhood memories such as Little League baseball games and seat belts. His witty, clean style of humor on the album, which resonated with a wide audience from college kids to grandmothers, catapulted him to success. Since then, he has gone on to release three DVDs. Punchline Magazine, a comedy publication, named Regan's most recent DVD, ""The Epitome of Hyperbole,"" one of the top five comedy DVDs of 2008. Nowadays, he routinely appears on television, including specials on Comedy Central and slots on the ""Late Show With David Letterman."" His tour this year will visit more than 80 cities, nearly twice as many as four years ago. CNN.com sat down with Regan to learn more about his brand of comedy and what's in store for the future. CNN: How did you become interested in comedy and stand-up? Brian Regan: This isn't the main reason, but when I was in college [Heidelberg College in Ohio], my name was Rip for Rip van Winkle. I had a 7 a.m. class, and I missed it almost every day. I would wake up and run across campus. I remember thinking, ""What's going to happen if I don't wake up for things?"" And then a comedian performed at our college, and I went to the show, and I noticed the show started at 8 p.m. and I was like, well, the hours are good. I can handle a job that starts at 8 p.m. CNN: Who are some of your influences? Regan: I love Steve Martin. He took silliness to a level of brilliance, I think. CNN: How do you get your ideas? Regan: I used to try and sit down with a blank piece of paper. I would stare at the paper, and it just continues to stay blank. I've learned that for me, it's easier for me to go out and live my life and do my thing. CNN: You don't really use the crass language many comedians rely on. Is there a reason for that? Regan: I don't really know those words [laughing]. I used to have a few jokes here and there with a four-letter word in it. I was always 90 to 95 percent clean with my jokes anyways, and I'm kind of anal so, why be 95 percent something when you could be 100 percent something? It worked out, and people really seem to respond to it so I guess that other 5 percent wasn't that important anyways. CNN: Do you try to incorporate the economy into your jokes? Regan: I do a few jokes about the economy but from an everyday person perspective. People like to laugh, and they especially like to laugh during difficult circumstances. One of the best shows in New York I had was the week after 9/11. I was surprised this comedy club was even going to have a show. They said people were looking for a diversion. I went up and said I'm not trying to make light of what happened, I'm just trying to forget about it for an hour. I find it's similar to what is happening with the economy. Obviously, it's not as serious as 9/11, but people are looking for an escape. I think people want to laugh. CNN: How can comedy help people through tough times? Regan: I think comedy is a good way to deal with anything. I hear about people in the hospital who are ill, and they use humor to help them through it. I think it's a great remedy for many things. They say a formula for comedy is comedy equals tragedy plus time. A difficult or uncomfortable situation takes place, and then you laugh about it later down the road. Sometimes I wonder if I could be so mentally healthy to subtract the time part. Like what if there is a flat tire, and it's raining outside? Instead of laughing a month later, why not laugh while you are changing tires in the rain? CNN: Your fan base has really grown in the last five years. How does the fame feel? Regan: It's been a slow gradual thing for me. I've never had a single event or television show that did it. I just pick up a couple more fans and a few more fans, and before you know it, it's like hey man, things are going OK. CNN: What's in store for the future? Regan: This is what I like doing, and I will hopefully do it forever. If something else comes along, I'd be open to that. CNN: What about a television show? Regan: I'm not really interested in being an actor. But I would like to get on a television show that would capture my comedy and in that role do a little acting. I'd like to do something that has to do with my comedy.","Brian Regan has become a top-ranked comedian by keeping material clean .
