Wearing high heels can be more of an endurance test than a pleasure, especially during the a hectic party season. A recent survey even revealed that more than a third of women said their feet had been so sore on a night out that they danced shoeless and walked home barefoot. But one High Street store thinks it has the answer to our vertiginous stiletto woes. Marks and Spencer has introduced Hi Heel Hosiery – tights with built-in pads which aim to alleviate the pain caused by stacked shoes. Comfort first: M&S has unveiled a new range of tights called Hi Heel Hosiery which have built-in pads to alleviate pain in the balls of your feet . These clever new tights aim to make tired feet a thing of the past by eliminating pain on the ball of the foot leaving women free to wear their favourite heels all night long. Speaking about the new hosiery, Paschal Little, Head of Lingerie Innovations, said: ‘The pads built into the bottom of the feet act as a cushion to relieve pain on the ball of the foot. ‘For additional comfort we have developed a shaped toe design which keeps the cushion in place.’ The . tights come in a variety of styles from classic opaque and natural to . leopard print and sparkling diamante (perfect for the more . fashion-forward women). The tights, which are available in store this month, are priced between £6 and £15. Dance all night long: As well as the pads M&S has developed a shaped toe design which aims to keep the cushion in place so women can wear their favourite heels for longer . But will they actually help? Kam Panesar, an osteopath at Adamina Spa, said: 'It sounds like the tights are just providing what Scholl and other foot specialists already do. 'They will make no difference to the rotation in the pelvis (that causes back and leg pain). 'If you tend to wear heels, however, they will allow you to wear high heels for a longer time with more comfort. 'So if you have no musculoskeletal problems and wear heels sporadically - they're a great buy!'.

It was thought to have died out over 50 years ago, but photographers have managed to snap an exceptionally rare lizard in Ecuador. The long-nosed Pinocchio lizard was spotted by a team of photographers and researchers after combing a remote area in the north west of the country for three years. The lizard, which was first discovered in 1953 and named after the fictional lying puppet, was thought to be extinct until 2005 and it has only been sighted three times since. Scroll down for video . After searching for the rare long-nosed Pinocchio anole (pictured) for three years, a team of photographers and researchers found the lizard recently in a stretch of pristine cloud forest in the northwest part of Ecuador, around two hours drive from the capital . The lizard was named after Pinocchio (puppet, pictured), a fictional character whose nose grew each time he lied . The curious-looking animal did a disappearing act in the 1960s and was not seen again until an ornithologist saw one crossing the road in the same stretch of cloud forest. The animal was most recently captured by Alejandro Arteaga, a co-founder of an eco-tourism company called Tropical Herping, which has been searching for the almost long-lost animal. The researcher told LiveScience that the best time to spot the rare lizards known as anoles is at night when they are sleeping and less likely to run away. As part of an expedition in January, one of his sharp-eyed team saw a male Pinocchio anole scaling a branch and the team managed to catch it and keep it overnight until they could photograph it in its natural surroundings the following morning. Mr Arteaga said: 'After looking for so long It was very thrilling to find this strange lizard.' The male lizard's long nose actually serves no real purpose apart from advertising its good genes and female anoles select their mates based on whether it has an impressive appendage. The females do not have long noses. The curious animal was discovered in 1953 but disappeared from the 1960s until it was spotted again in 2005.

A study has found that slimmers who attended Weight Watchers lost just over 10lb on average – enough to drop a dress size. In contrast, those who went it alone were only a mere 1lb or so lighter six months later. It is thought that dieters benefit from regular contact with others with the same goal.  Plus, the thought that the next weekly meeting – which includes a weigh in – may help them avoid giving into temptation. Slimmers who attended Weight Watchers lost on average just over 10lb in six months, a study has found . Paying to attend classes may also boost motivation. In contrast, those who devise their own diet may lose interest, especially if their weight loss is not as rapid as they would like. They may also give up because the their eating plan may be too restrictive or difficult to follow long-term.  In the study, almost 300 men and women were split into two groups. One group attended Weight Watchers meetings for six months.  The others were given leaflets and other information but left to come up with their own weight loss plan. Those in the slimming club were eight times more likely to shed five per cent of their flab – an amount judged to make an impact on health. In contrast, those who went it alone were only a mere 1lb or so lighter six months later . Those who attended the most meetings did the best.   However, access to an internet program and mobile phone app also helped, the American Journal of Medicine reports. Researcher Craig Johnson, of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, said: ‘The people who were most engaged were the people who did best.’ Karen Miller-Kovach, of Weight Watchers, which funded the study, said that that the slimming group can provide ‘proven, effective, affordable and convenient treatment’ to tackle the public health challenge posed by obesity. The study is far from the first to conclude that Weight Watchers works and the NHS already regularly pays for people to attend classes. The weekly sessions begin with the infamous ‘weigh-in’, in which members step on to the scales in a private corner of the room to discover if their efforts have been successful. They then learn about healthy eating including the points-based system which scores food according to their protein, carbohydrate, fat and fibre content. But some experts say that it is the group dynamic that is important – and other slimming groups work just as well. Dr Ian Campbell, a GP and medical director of charity Weight Concern, said: ‘The real secret of weight loss is getting deeper than just calories in and calories out and looking at what causes us to do the things we do and the choices we make. ‘And certainly doing it for longer than the six months cited in this study.’","Study of 300 men and women published in the American Journal of Medicine .

A super slim vet saved a sheepdog stuck in a rocky crevice after mountain rescuers were too big to reach him. Slightly-built Kes Taylor, 35, was brought in to wriggle down the tiny gap to reach the collie dog, Chip, stuck 82ft underground. Kes was the smallest volunteer in the desperate operation to rescue Chip who had been trapped in the crevice for two days. Scroll down for video . Claustraphobic: Super skinny Kes Taylor (pictured) was called in to help rescue Chip who had been stuck for two days. Male rescuers got stuck when they tried to reach the dog . Unhurt: Chip was eventually brought up two days after he fell in the narrow gap. It took vet Kes, 34, an hour to reach him . It's a long way down: Collie dog Chip had been rounding up sheep when he slipped down the 80ft crevice and was only rescued when Kes Taylor (pictured) was lowered down by mountain rescue . She said: 'They picked me after some of the men had a go and got stuck half way down. 'Luckily for Chip I was thin enough to squeeze my way along the gap to reach him.' The drama began when Chip fell down the crevice while rounding up sheep on a mountainside in Snowdonia, North Wales. A mountain rescue team was called to search for the missing farm dog and heard him whimpering from inside the mountain. Local vet Kes was called to treat the collie when he was brought to the surface. But after the male rescuers failed to reach him, they asked Kes to descended into the crevice attached to ropes. Apprehensive: Kes (pictured) had never been potholing before rescuing Chip. However, after other mountain rescue volunteers got stuck, she was the only one slim enough to wriggle down and get him . Stuck: Kes Taylor (pictured) was only going up the mountain to help the dog once it had been freed, but was 'roped' in to the rescue as she was thinnest . Encouraging: Kes said she hadn't expected to go into the crevice herself but the other mountain rescue volunteers talked her through it from above .

The vet from Llanberis, North Wales, had never attempted a rescue like this before . Exhausting: Keen mountain walker Kes was helped out of the tiny gap by mountain rescue volunteers . Rob said the team knew it would be 'an interesting rescue' when they heard whimpering coming from inside the deep mountain crevice.

'One team member was volunteered as being the skinniest build and lowered down into the slot. 'But about half way down he became wedged and had to be pulled back up and out.' 'So we lowered Kes down and she spent an hour wriggling and worming her way down to him. 'The dog seemed miraculously unhurt after he reached the surface.

A ten year-old boy with one of the rarest disorders in the UK is surviving - thanks to a diet of Lucozade. Archie Koncher is one of just three people in the country with Propionic Aciduria which means his body converts protein into lethal toxins which damage his vital organs. He is limited to just 25g of protein a day - equivalent to a pint of milk - and any more than that could kill him. Archie Koncher is one of just three people in the country with Propionic Aciduria. The condition means his body converts protein into lethal toxins which poison his vital organs. He is limited to just 25g of protein a day - equivalent to a pint of milk - and any more than that could kill him . The genetic disorder is incurable but brave Archie is beating it by drinking up to four bottles of Lucozade a day, which gives him the energy he cannot get from food. His daily intake of the drink contains a whopping 33 teaspoons of sugar - and costs his parents £120 every month. His father Dave, 45, an auctioneer, said: 'It just keeps him going - we wish we could get it on prescription. 'If he is starting to feel a bit tired, maybe after he has been running around, it will just pick him up again straight away. The genetic disorder is incurable but Archie is beating it by drinking up to four bottles of Lucozade a day, which gives him the energy he cannot get from food. His daily intake of the drink contains a 33 teaspoons of sugar - and costs his parents £120 every month . 'Without a doubt, without that drink, we . would be in serious trouble. We’ve tried all sorts of different foods . but this is the one for Archie.' When Archie, from Stoke Orchard, Gloucestershire was born, he did not respond to the world around him and doctors initially misdiagnosed him as being on the autistic spectrum. It was not until his second birthday that a routine blood and urine test revealed he had Propionic Aciduria. Propionic Acidemia (PA) is a rare . disorder that is inherited from both parents. Neither parent shows . symptoms, but both carry a defective gene responsible for this . disorder. People with PA . cannot break down parts of protein and some types of fat due to either a . missing or a non-functioning enzyme called PCC. This . inability causes a build-up of harmful substances which can cause . damage to the person’s heart, liver, brain, and bones.  The result can . be seizures, delays to normal development like walking and talking, and . other health problems. During times of illness, a patient with PA may need to be hospitalised to prevent breakdown of proteins within the body. Every day a PA patient must try and get enough protein for normal growth - but not so much that they become ill. Although some PA children learn to eat, most require tube feeding since they have little to no appetite and food aversions. Source: www.pafoundation.com . Unchecked, the condition would create toxic amino acids which would attack vital organs and eventually his entire body would shut down. Mr Koncher and his wife Salli, 42, immediately swapped his normal milk and baby food for non-protein food and saw an overnight change. Archie, who weighs barely five stone, now eats tiny portions alongside his parents and older brother Charlie, 16, but carefully avoids high protein foods like fish. He now drinks up to four 380ml bottles of Lucozade a day, each containing 33g of sugar. Mr Koncher added: He eats a lot of carbs too, like crisps and noodles, with the Lucozade too of course and anything high sugar. 'When he is well you wouldn’t know there was anything different about him, but he is about the height of an eight-year-old simply because he is eating so much less.' His mother 42, an administrator, said: 'We are very lucky he is still alive - it is a silent killer.  You just don’t know what can happen. 'When he gets very lethargic, we have to be careful. When he vomits, we have to get him to hospital immediately. 'He can’t have too much protein. When we go to McDonald’s for a treat, he has to have the chips, and only half the burger, with no bun. 'For him, an egg is a treat. He can’t have any more. It’s heart-wrenching. 'We don’t know what the future holds but we are just happy that he is a happy little boy and loving life.'","Archie Koncher is one of just three people in the UK with Propionic Aciduria .

Russian President Vladmir Putin has been nominated for the Nobel peace prize. In a bizarre revelation, former Labour peer Lord Truscott revealed he had nominated the Russian President for his recent actions in Syria. However the Labour party moved quickly to disown the idea, insisting it was not party policy to give a gong to the President.

Wreckage: A damaged vehicle is seen on a street with buildings damaged by what activists said was shelling by forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in the besieged area of Homs last week . Lord Truscott took the Lords by surprise at question time by announcing that he had taken the unusual step over nominating Putin for the prize. Instead the prize this week went to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the international body overseeing the destruction of Syria's chemical arsenal. Lord Truscott, who sits as a non-affiliated peer after being suspended for misconduct in 2009, said: ‘Many people would argue that the Russian-led Syrian peace plan is the most significant peace initiative this year. Lord Truscott, who nominated Putin, was kicked out of the Labour party four years ago . ‘To recognise this and encourage Russia in its peace-making endeavours, a few hours ago, I nominated President Putin for the Nobel peace prize.’ The peer, who has written a biography of the president, asked if the Government would dissent from such a move. But this was sidestepped by Cabinet office spokesman Lord Wallace of Saltaire, who told him: ‘This has been a joint US-Russian peace initiative. It's not purely a Russian-led peace initiative. ‘We welcome the constructive response Russia is now making on Syria and we hope and expect that the Russians will ensure President Assad and his regime are represented at the Geneva Two peace conference at the end of November.’ However Labour frontbencher Lord Triesman told peers: ‘I should make clear that it's no part of the official opposition's policy to nominate President Putin for the Nobel peace prize.’ The initiative to destroy Syria's chemical weapons was ‘plainly welcome’ but there was still much more to do to secure peace, he said. Lord Truscott and another Labour peer were suspended for six months in 2009 after being found by a Lords committee to be willing to change laws in exchange for cash. The two men denied the allegations made by the Sunday Times. Lord Truscott, who resigned from the Labour Party, argued he has been made a scapegoat.","Lord Truscott reveals he has put the Vladmir Putin's name forward for prize .

A rare 200-year-old coin which was hidden for half a century in a tiny cabinet made of matchboxes has sold for £225,700 - a staggering 72 million times its face value. The U.S. copper half cent was minted in 1796 and was one of just 1,400 ever struck. It was picked out of a hoard of 70 coins by an expert after being taken to an auction house in Wiltshire. The collection had been gathered by Oxford student Mark Hillary, who died aged 20 in 1963 in a climbing accident. The rare 200-year-old coin which sold for £225,700 was hidden in a matchbox for 50 years . The bulk of his collection was sold at auction years ago, but the 70 leftover coins remained hidden at his former home for almost 50 years. It was not until family members had an attic clear-out that the 18th century coin was discovered. The half cent bears a liberty head design on one side, with a pole and liberty cap in the background. The reverse side of the copper coin, which is in mint condition, shows an open wreath of olive stems tied with a ribbon. Heads or tails: The family of Mark Hillary were 'chuffed' at their luck in finding the 1796 coin in their attic . The auction saw huge interest from . American bidders and the half cent sold to The Numismatic Financial . Corporation in Florida which buys and sells rare coins. The . hammer price for the coin, that is one inch in diameter, was . £185,000 but with additional fees included the overall price was £225,700. Mr Hillary's family attended the sale and said they were 'very excited and chuffed to bits' with the outcome. The . coin was struck in pure copper at . the Philadelphia Mint and designed by the mint's first chief engraver . Robert Scott. Daniel . Fearon, a coin consultant at Salisbury-based Woolley and Wallis . auctioneers, said: 'It is a wonderful result and a satisfying ending to . an amazing find.

Speakers at Miriam Carey's funeral today tried to give more insight into the person widely known as the young woman killed by police in Washington after she tried to ram her car through a White House barrier. The 34-year-old single mother was described as a generous, loving sister - one of five - who was a passionate, fun-loving cook who loved making meals for an extended family in Brooklyn. She considered her family the most important part of life, Amy Carey-Jones, one of her sisters told mourners.

Miriam Carey's sister Amy Carey-Jones (right) is embraced by an unidentified woman outside the Grace Funeral Chapels in Brooklyn, New York, as she mourns her loss . Miriam Carey was shot dead by police after a car chase in Washington DC . She also was ambitious, sharing with her sisters a plan to get a master's degree in a health field, Amy Carey said. Miriam Carey, who had worked as a dental hygienist, was praised by her colleagues for her 'delightful bedside manner', said the program for the service, held at Brooklyn chapel and attended by about 90 mourners. Carey was dressed in white, and lay in a white casket. Prayers were offered as the lid was slowly closed; a woman sobbed loudly as the casket was wheeled to a waiting hearse for a police-escorted trip to a Long Island cemetery. She had been living in Stamford, Conn., and is survived by her one-year-old daughter, who was in the vehicle during the Oct. 3 car chase through the streets of Washington. Carey had been diagnosed with postpartum depression and psychosis. Authorities say she believed President Barack Obama was monitoring her electronically. Police found no weapons in her car, and family members have said officers never should have fired at Carey's vehicle. 'We're still very confused as a family why she's not still alive,' Carey-Jones said on Oct. 5 after traveling to Washington to identify Miriam Carey's body. Another sister, retired New York City police officer Valarie Carey, said there was 'no need for a gun to be used when there was no gunfire coming from the vehicle.' A lawyer for the family, Eric Sanders, has blamed Carey's death on fear of terrorism leading to a 'siege mentality' in the U.S. Valarie Carey, second from right, sister of Miriam Carey, enter the Grace Funeral Chapels for funeral services today .

Valarie Carey created a celebratory video tribute shown during the service, with a slideshow of a mostly smiling Miriam Carey from her childhood through graduation from Brooklyn College.

He was watched by a crowd of around 20 tourists.  When police searched Belmar after bringing him to the ground, they found the kitchen knife wrapped in a plastic bag in his jacket pocket. Scroll down for video . In court: David Belmar, 44, of Haringey, north London, admitted trespass and possession of a bladed article after he tried to run through the palace's north centre gate just before 11.30am yesterday . Royal incident: Police outside Buckingham Palace yesterday after a 44-year-old tried to get in with a knife . Edward Aydin, prosecuting, told . Westminster Magistrates’ Court in Central London: ‘In police custody, he . said to police “I wanted to see the Queen. I’m not happy about my . benefits”.’ He added that . Belmar, who has mental health issues, has a fixation with the Queen and . received a caution in 1989 for lighting fireworks and throwing them into . the grounds of Buckingham Palace. The . Queen was not in the building at the time of the incident, Buckingham . Palace said. District Judge Quentin Purdy adjourned sentencing so that . pre-sentence reports could be carried out. He remanded Belmar in custody until he is sentenced at Southwark Crown Court at a date to be set. Belmar, . who appeared in court wearing a black jumper with an Umbro logo and . blue jeans, went to the front of Buckingham Palace at 11.29am, Mr Aydin . said. He told the court Mr Belmar, who is of a stocky build, was seen to suddenly break into a run. Arrest: The intruder sprinted in via its north gate (pictured guarded by police), which is open for cars, at around 11.30am . ‘He . then turned into the grounds of the palace and jumped over the vehicle . barrier by putting his foot on that barrier,’ said Mr Aydin. ‘Two police . officers, armed, one of them shouted: “Stop!” - he continued to run. ‘As . you can see he’s quite a large man. He was rugby tackled to the ground . because he wouldn’t stop. Police called out on two occasions.’ He . added that other officers rushed to help apprehend Belmar. A number of . children were at the gates of the palace watching while the incident was . unfolding, the court heard. ‘Armed . guards had to stop him,’ said Mr Aydin. ‘He could have been fired upon. Other people could have been hurt. And there was a risk of some form of . disorder there outside the palace.’ Belmar . was under the care of mental health services from 2002 to 2010 and . lives with his father and brother, both of whom sat in the court’s . public gallery for today’s hearing. Relief: Queen Elizabeth II, pictured last week, was not at home yesterday when they security alert happened . Mr Aydin said Belmar was a man with a long history of mental illness who is a danger to himself. He . added: ‘His behaviour that morning, yesterday, was unpredictable. He is . a danger to the public, carrying a knife in central London, and he is a . danger to the Queen.’ Robert Katz, defending, denied Belmar has a fixation with the Queen or Buckingham Palace, as it was claimed. He . said his client had been on incapacity benefit for the past 10 years . but that it was stopped after he was assessed in September. Mr Katz said: ‘He became very upset by that decision and he didn’t know how he was going to cope.’ He . added that Belmar did not brandish the knife and was not going to use . it, but that he had ‘wanted to draw publicity to what had happened to . him’. Belmar, who admitted . trespass on a protected site and possession of a bladed or pointed . article, has a number of previous convictions, including for actual . bodily harm and criminal damage. Sky News flies over the scene moments after arrest . Interest: Tourists crowd the area and take photographs where the armed 44-year-old was wrestled to the floor . Mr Aydin told the court that Belmar becomes violent when taking some of his medication for mental health problems. District Judge Purdy said the case was too serious to be dealt with in the magistrates’ court, given his past convictions.

For more than 30 years HMS Illustrious sailed the oceans as a powerful symbol of Britain's proud maritime history. But today ministers raised the prospect . that Illustrious could meet an undignified end in a wrecking yard . being turned into tin cans and razor blades. Now they have issued a desperate plea to anyone with a few million pounds to spare to buy the 22,000-tonne warship and turn it into a tourist attraction. Warning: Ministers are desperate to find a buyer for HMS Illustrious to prevent her facing an undignified end being broken up for scrap . Ministers last year promised the 25,000-tone floating fortress would be preserved as a lasting tribute to the Royal Navy's Invincible-class aircraft carriers when it completes active service in 2014. The pledge came after her two sister warships - Invincible, and Ark Royal - were both controversially sold for scrap metal for around £3million. Defence Minister Philip Dunne played down concerns at the time that an important part of the UK's naval heritage would be lost by insisting: 'It is important that we preserve the legacy of the Invincible-class aircraft carriers.' But today Mr Davies admitted it could also end up on the scrap heap unless a benefactor can be found. He said the vessel, currently serving as a helicopter carrier on military war games in the Mediterranean, could be broken up unless a buyer comes forward to preserve it as a tourist attraction. Huge: The 210-metre (689ft) long ship - based in Portsmouth - was built by Swan Hunter on Tyneside and launched in 1978 . In a Commons statement he warned the carrier could be sold for recycling if no suitable bids were received. He said: 'HMS Illustrious, the last of these three iconic ships, is due to retire from service with the Royal Navy in 2014. 'The Ministry of Defence's Disposal Services Authority (DSA) has launched a competition which will seek innovative re-use bids to retain the ship in the UK, with part or all of it developed for heritage purposes.' He said organisations would be expected to put forward 'mature and viable proposals, in keeping with the role and history of the Invincible class of ships'. Proposals to turn HMS Illustrious - nicknamed Lusty - into a floating museum and tourist attraction to lure thousands of visitors are already being drawn up. In 2006, the crew of HMS Illustrious spelt out the message 'Happy 80th' to mark the Queen's birthday . Stepping out: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh on board Illustrious during a state visit to Malta in 2005 . But Mr Dunne warned: 'In the event that no suitable re-use bids with a heritage element are submitted, the DSA will open up the competition by seeking proposals for other uses or recycling.' The ship is 210-metre (689ft) - the equivalent of 18 double-decker buses. Based in Portsmouth, was built by Swan Hunter on Tyneside and launched in 1978. She relieved HMS Invincible in the Falklands after the 1982 conflict and was involved in the Gulf War and the conflict in Afghanistan in 2001, and supported evacuations from Sierra Leone in 2000 and Lebanon in 2006. HMS Illustrious was converted to be used as the navy's helicopter carrier following the Government's decision to sell the Harrier jets which operated from its flightdeck. The decision left the Royal Navy without an aircraft carrier until the new Queen Elizabeth class enters service later this decade. HMS Queen Elizabeth, which is almost complete, will begin sea trials in 2017 before undertaking flight trials with the F-35 Lightning II aircraft in 2018.","30-year-old ship put up for sale but could be heading for the scrapyard .

The panda later made it down on its own after the crowd had dispersed for the night, and safely made it back to the woods. Giant pandas are solitary bears when in the wild, usually preferring their own company when foraging in Chinese bamboo forests. They are an endangered species, with less than 2,000 thought to be left roaming free in the cool forests that are their natural habitat. They mostly eat bamboo, but in captivity are also enjoy being fed honey, eggs, fish, yams, leaves, oranges, bananas and other special treats.","Chinese giant panda stuck in spruce tree in northwest province .

The gummi bear baron who built the Haribo sweet empire has died at the age of 90. Hans Riegel, the driving force behind Germany's Haribo confectionary and much-loved gummi bears, died of heart failure today in Bonn, according to his office. Mr Riegel, who spent almost seven decades at the helm of the company, invented its world-famous 'kids and grown-ups love it so' slogan. He also made Haribo's gummi bears - beloved for their bright colours and teddy-bear shape - a sugary staple across the globe. Mr Riegel, who inherited the company from his candymaker father in 1946, built it up into a candy giant that now employs more than 6,000 people. It has an annual turnover of about $2.5billion (£1.6billion) and claims to churn out 100 million gummi bears every day. It also makes a range of jellied sweets, including cola bottles, hearts, milk bottles, liquorice and dummies. The brand, which has become a global household name, has 15 factories across Europe and exports to 100 countries. In a tribute to Mr Reigel's success in making Haribo a 'global brand', German foreign minister Guido Westerwelle said: 'Wherever I travelled in the last few years, the gold bears had already long been there.' Mr Riegel's father, also named Hans, founded Haribo - an acronym for 'Hans Riegel Bonn' - in 1920. Mr Riegel was the driving force behind the success of Haribo's gummi bears - beloved for their bright colours and teddy-bear shape . In 1922, the candymaker invented the 'dancing bear' - a small bear made out of fruit gum that laid the . foundations for Haribo's later success. He died in 1945. After their release as allied prisoners in the Second World War, Mr Riegel and his younger brother Paul set about rebuilding the family firm. At the time, the company had only about 30 employees - however, five years later, the Riegel brothers were in charge of at least 1,000 members of staff. Paul Riegel, who died in 2009, focused on . production, while Hans Riegel took charge of marketing and sales - coining the much-quoted jingle 'kids and . grown-ups love it so, the happy world of Haribo'. Mr Riegel poses next to a stuffed Haribo gummi bear outside the firm's headquarters in Bonn, Germany . According to Haribo, Mr Riegel was inspired by children's magazines and comics. 'I love children. They are my customers. I have to be informed . about what they want to nibble, what they think, what language they . speak,' he once said. In the 1960s and 1970s, the company acquired businesses in the Netherlands, France and Britain, before setting up a sales office in Baltimore, America, in 1982. Its worldwide success may have been encouraged by the fact that, in 1985, Disney launched an animated television series called 'Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears'. Despite no direct link to the sweets being made, the cartoons were shown around the globe. In 2000, Haribio was criticised for refusing to contribute to a fund set up by German businesses and the government to compensate forced labourers during the Nazi period. The company insisted there was no evidence it had ever benefited from forced labour. Mr Riegel was awarded Germany's highest honor, the Federal Cross of Merit, in 1994. The award recognised not only his successful business career, but his commitment to social issues, such as his encouragement of the training of talented young people and sports. At the time of his death, Mr Riegel had been recovering from an operation to remove a benign brain tumour. He remained a co-owner and active participator in Haribo until the end.","Hans Riegel was the driving force behind Haribo's beloved gummi bears .

Homeopaths are putting patients at risk by discouraging them from seeking essential medical treatment, according to a damning ruling by watchdogs. Practitioners have also been found guilty of making unproven health claims in a landmark decision by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). An assessment of treatments and claims made by the Society of Homeopaths suggests practitioners are offering false hope and may be causing real harm. The ruling raises serious questions about the value of homeopathy, which has many well-known advocates, including Prince Charles and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. It will also reignite the row over why the NHS is spending £4million a year offering homeopathic remedies in the face of evidence that they do not work. The ASA tested a series of statements made by the society, and rigorous analysis by an independent expert found there was insufficient evidence to support the claimed benefits. Homeopathy involves treating the patient with highly diluted substances, given mainly in tablet form. The idea is that even very low levels of substances, such as plant extracts, trigger the body’s natural system of healing. But research has shown that the level of the substances offered to patients are so small – or even non-existent – that they cannot have a biological effect. Practitioners have also been found guilty of making unproven health claims in a landmark decision by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) Most worrying is the concern that people who rely on homeopathic remedies are being diverted away from conventional treatments which could offer genuine benefits. The society’s website said evidence existed to show homeopathy can treat a wide range of ailments. But the ASA said several of these – bronchitis, osteoarthritis and vertigo – were conditions for which medical supervision should be sought, rather than relying on homeopathy. Consequently, it said the claims were a breach of its advertising codes. The ruling raises serious questions about the value of homeopathy, which has many well-known advocates, including Prince Charles (pictured) and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt . Significantly, it said the evidence supplied by the society to back up its claims was not strong enough, and ruled that the claims were ‘misleading and had not been substantiated’. The independent expert said the evidence presented by the society was ‘not convincing in terms of efficacy and it was unlikely to be generally accepted by the scientific community’. The ASA has warned the society to stop making claims that are not supported by good evidence.Society chairman Diane Goodwin insisted that evidence did exist for the benefits of homeopathy, but that the society was prepared to change the way it marketed treatments.","Practitioners have been found guilty of making unproven health claims .

An obese woman has described the wake-up call that saved her life – the moment her fiancé and young son found what they thought to be her dead body. At a size 30 and weighing 22 stone, Joanne Williamson, 38, from North Shields, Tyne and Wear, was so overweight she passed out after making a cup of tea. The terrified reaction of her fiance and son motivated her to change her lifestyle and she has now lost an incredible 10 stone and dropped from a size 30 to size 12. Joanne dropped from 22 stone and size 30 (left) to 12 stone and a trim size 12 (right) Michael and Lewis, 10, found Joanne after she had collapsed from heat exhaustion and feared the worst . Having already been warned her weight would kill her, when fiancé Mick and son Lewis found her face down, they feared the worst. When he saw she was still breathing, Mick, 50, called an ambulance and Joanne was taken to hospital and treated for cuts and bruising. Medics warned she’d suffered heat exhaustion caused by being so overweight. Joanne said: ‘Thankfully I was fine, but my son and fiancé were utterly distraught'. ‘It was a wake-up call for me. I saw how upset they were and it gave me a glimpse of the future and I didn’t want to put them through that.’ Fiance Michael said: ‘ When I saw her lying there I thought that was it. I shouted at our son to go away because I didn’t want him to see his mum’s body. ‘Joanne promised never to put us through that again.’ True to her word Joanne went on a diet and lost nine and a half stone going from a size 30 to a size 12 weighing 12 stone 7lbs. Though she wore a smile, Joanne admits that she was wracked with crippling shame over her weight . Joanne said:’ I’m glad I collapsed because it made me realise what I was putting my family through and I needed to change for them. ‘I’ve lost all that weight and I’ve found myself again. I’m so happy that my family are so proud of me.’ Her journey started in 2010 after waving son Lewis, 10, and partner Michael off to the shops. Joanne recalls: ‘I was too fat to go with them so I made myself a cup of tea and went into the garden to drink it. ‘I got up to make another and that was the last thing I remember.’ She woke up to see Michael and Lewis staring anxiously at her face. She says: ‘I didn’t know what had happened, but Michael sounded terrified and said he was calling an ambulance.’ Joanne piled on more weight with each of her two pregnancies with Lewis, pictured, and his sister Hayley-Marie, 15 . Joanne admits that before she lost weight her usual diet consisted mainly of takeaways, pasties, crisps and chocolate . At North Tyneside General Hospital she was treated for cuts and bruises. The doctors diagnosed heat exhaustion caused by her weight. ‘I knew I was big at 22 stone and a size 30, but it was a shock to hear I was so big I had just passed out going to make a cuppa. 'Of course I’d always hated my weight but it had never affected me in such a serious way before.' Joanne was upset to see how distraught her son and partner were. ‘When Mick explained that hey both thought I was dead and I could see how shaken they were because they had tears in their eyes just talking about it. 'Mick gave me some tough love. He told me it couldn't happen again, that he couldn't face seeing me like that and I had to lose weight for all of our sakes. ‘He wasn’t being nasty, he wanted to help me.’ Joanne agreed, but having been overweight since hitting her teens she knew losing weight was going to be easier said than done. ‘I’d fallen in love with food as a teenager, and my weight had been an issue since the age of about 14.’ Joanne ended up becoming a recluse and was diagnosed with agoraphobia, spending her time sleeping and eating . She’d attempted countless diets over the years but always ended up going back to her usual diet of takeaways, pasties, crisps and chocolate. She piled on more weight with each of her two pregnancies with Lewis and sister Hayley-Marie, 15. ‘I used my pregnancies as an excuse to stuff my face without feeling guilty. It was the only time I could justify the huge amount of food I was eating.’ Though she wore a smile, Joanne admits that she was wracked with crippling shame over her weight and started avoiding social situations. ‘I arranged nights out with my mates and Mick, but I would always cancel at the last minute with some lame excuse, but the truth was I just felt too embarrassed about the way I looked to have a good time in public.’ Joanne says losing weight has given her her life back . At one point she had even been diagnosed with agoraphobia caused by the shame of being so fat. ‘Mick was the breadwinner because ultimately my confidence got so low I couldn’t even face leaving the house to work. ‘I packed in the job I loved as a machinist because leaving the house got me in such a sate. ‘It was a vicious cycle because I would just spend all day eating and sleeping and getting even fatter.’ Her GP offered to help, but only after she’d lost two stone herself and Joanne just couldn’t find the motivation to start. Going to hospital was the wake up call she needed to motivate her. ‘She explains: Suddenly after the years of trying it was like something just clicked in my head and I promised my family they would never ever have to worry about me again.' Michael promised Joanne she wouldn’t be alone in her battle and that he would support her every step of the way. First Joanne followed Weight Watchers online and hired a treadmill from a local gym equipment hire company. ‘I was too heavy for standard home treadmills so needed a stronger one,’ she says. And true to his word, Michael researched the Weight Watchers diet and started writing down everything she ate to keep track of her calories. Together they cleared the house of crisps, sweets and treats and filled the fridge with salad, lean meat and veg. In the first week she lost 11lbs and a further 7lb the second week. ‘I don’t want it to sound easy because it wasn’t’ she explains. ‘I really missed food, especially all my old favourites and it took every ounce of determination I had not to slip back into my old ways. Every time she feared falling off the wagon, her partner would remind her how upset they had been seeing her  ‘dead body.’ ‘It was all I needed to get back on the diet. Finally after losing four stone she felt more confident about leaving the house. ‘I had a panic attack and we had to go home again. But at least I had made it out.’ The following weekend they tried again and Joanne treated herself to a size 18 pair of jeans – six sizes down. She says: ‘I hadn’t been that size for years so I was thrilled.’ Month after month she continued to lose weight steadily and has now reached 12 stone 7lbs and a size 12 to 14. ‘I’ve got my waistline back and I’ve got my life back too.’ Last year she applied for a machinist job and has remained in full time employment. 'I cycle to work every day and love walks with the kids. I’m gutted that I wasted so long being fat and glad I got the wake up call that changed my life.’","Joanne weighed a dangerous 22st, and collapsed from heat exhaustion .

With his East Coast accent and tales of living in New York, Jay Shaw stood out when he moved to the tiny farm town of Marsing, Idaho. But he was friendly enough, even helpful, to his neighbors, and they never suspected him of having a dark secret. After about a decade of living the quiet life of a would-be cattle rancher, his past closed in on him one day in 2011 as he was negotiating a purchase of hay near his 12-acre ranch. Secret life: Enrico M Ponzo, right, who was known as Jay Shaw to his neighbors in the rural town of Marsing, Idaho, with his friend Kelly Verceles, left, at a hockey game in Boise . A 1994 file photo provided by the FBI shows Enrico Ponzo - he had been living quietly as an Idaho rancher for almost two decades before the law caught up with him . Massachusetts authorities had caught up with him, more than 16 years after he disappeared. His real name was Enrico Ponzo, and he was wanted on numerous federal charges in a racketeering indictment, including the 1989 attempted murder of Francis 'Cadillac Frank' Salemme, who went on to become the boss of the Patriarca crime family. As his trial got underway in Boston last week, his former neighbors in Idaho watched the news coverage closely, some still stunned that the novice rancher they knew was accused of being mixed up with mobsters in Boston. 'It was almost unbelievable,' said farmer Bob Briggs, who was talking about hay with Ponzo when he was arrested. 'People couldn't understand why and what for and how come.' In Idaho, where he had lived for a little over a decade, Ponzo owned a handful of cows and spent a lot of time with his two young children. 'He told me he was from New York and that he had been in the Army,' said Briggs, who farmed land across from where Ponzo lived and got to know him. In August 2010, Ponzo's longtime girlfriend Cara Pace left with their kids and moved to another state. 'It almost killed him,' Briggs said. 'He took care of them, he fed them, he did everything for them. He was just devastated when she took the kids.' In this artist's sketch, 42-year-old Enrico Ponzo appears in federal court in Boise, Idaho. He is accused of being part of a plot to kill a crime boss . Six months later, Ponzo was arrested. 'It was almost unbelievable,' Briggs said. 'I sure had him pegged wrong.' Prosecutors said Ponzo was a mob associate who teamed up with a faction of mobsters that wanted to stop Salemme from becoming the boss. Ponzo was wanted for the attempted murder of Francis Salemme, a mob boss turned government informant who is now believed to be in the witness protection program . In a 1997 indictment, Ponzo and Vincent Marino are named as the triggermen who shot at Salemme as he walked into an IHOP in Saugus, north of Boston. Ponzo was among 15 people indicted by a grand jury investigating organized crime. Charges against Ponzo include conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to distribute cocaine and firearms counts. He faces a sentence of up to life in prison if convicted. In opening statements to the jury, Assistant U.S. Attorney Karen Beausey said Ponzo, now 45, was an associate in the Patriarca family, the New England branch of the Mafia. During the late '80s and early '90s, she said, Ponzo and his co-conspirators participated in extortions, assaults and attempted murders while rival factions were vying for control of the crime group. 'He was part of the group who was trying to seize control,' she said. Beausey said Ponzo 're-invented himself' while he was on the run, first as a large-scale marijuana distributor in Arizona, then as a cattle rancher in Idaho. She said Ponzo used the money he made illegally in Arizona to re-establish himself and his girlfriend in Idaho. 'They bought land there, they bought a house. They started to raise a family there,' she said. Ponzo's lawyer, John Cunha Jr., told jurors that Ponzo was not a made member or an associate of the Mafia. He also challenged the credibility of the government's witnesses, including mob figures who cut deals with prosecutors for reduced sentences. 'As you listen to these people, keep in mind the powerful tool that the government has to elicit testimony that it wants,' Cunha said. Ponzo believed he was on a hit list created by a mobster whose son was shot to death while changing a flat tire, Ponzo's lawyer said. 'So what did Mr. Ponzo do?' Cunha asked. 'He left. He wasn't going to get killed.' The residence once occupied by former New England area mob member Enrico Ponzo in Marsing, Idaho where his neighbors knew him as Jay Shaw .","Enrico Ponzo wanted on .

And today the Italian navy rescued about 370 migrants between Sicily and Libya the government deployed ships, helicopters and unmanned drones to help avert further shipwrecks. A naval frigate and a patrol boat brought some 290 people, mostly Syrians, Somalis and Eritreans, to Lampedusa after two migrant vessels used satellite phones to dial for help late on Monday, the navy said. Lampedusa, which lies southwest of Sicily and just 70 miles (113 km) from the coast of Tunisia, has been a stepping stone for migrants seeking a better life in Europe for two decades. The coffins are placed on the quayside in Sicily after being unloaded from the Italian military ship Libra . Crew members of the Italian military vessel Libra prepare to use the crane to unload coffins of the refugees who died in the tragedy earlier this month . Now the Syrian civil war and unrest in Egypt and other Arab and African countries are fuelling the flow of refugees, many of whom have to pass through an increasingly unstable Libya. Sicily's regional parliament declared a state of emergency on Tuesday, a move that allows it to tap additional funds to help its struggling immigration services. The reception centre on Lampedusa, which is under Sicily's administration, is now hosting four or five times its capacity. To try to stem the flow of rickety boats and prevent further tragedies, Italy began on Tuesday deploying more ships, long-range helicopters, an airplane equipped with night-vision, plus unmanned drone aircraft.

Pressure to secure a better deal for pensioners facing crippling care home costs intensified yesterday. Former minister Stephen Dorrell said a plan to offer loans to pay for care was not delivering ‘the objective the Government set out’. Mr Dorrell, chairman of the Commons health select committee, particularly questioned a proposal to limit loans to people with assets of less than £23,000. Former minister Stephen Dorrell said a plan to offer loans to pay for care was not delivering 'the objective the Government set out' In July, the Coalition promised that the loans scheme would prevent anyone from having to meet the cost of care while they were alive. In a second attack on the scheme yesterday, Lord Lipsey suggested that pensioners taking up the loans could be forced to repay thousands of pounds if they inadvertently failed to disclose all their assets. He urged ministers to change a ‘nasty’ part of the new legislation that could penalise elderly people who make an honest mistake in applying for the loans from their council. ‘As the Bill is now drafted, if you make a mistake the local authority can pursue you for all the money and even sell your house if you make a mistake,’ he said. ‘Fraud should be pursued, but not an old lady who has just made a mistake. It is a very nasty clause.’ Promise: Care minister Norman Lamb and Daily Mail headlines from yesterday, top, and 2012, bottom . Lord Lipsey’s attack came as Downing . Street signalled a change of heart over plans to deny middle-class . pensioners access to the deferred-payment scheme, under which . Government-backed loans would cover home help hire and care home fees, . and would be repaid from the person’s estate. Lord Warner, a member of the independent Dilnot Commission that drew up plans to cap care costs, said of the Government: ‘I think they’ve been a bit sneaky.’ Lord Lipsey has praised the Daily Mail for its ‘sustained and splendid’ campaign against crippling care home costs that force people to sell their homes. The peer said the paper had made a real difference by bringing the scandal to the public’s attention. On Monday night, he exposed the Government’s plans to restrict access to a deferred-payment scheme to those with assets of less than around £23,000. During his speech in the House of Lords, he also mentioned his admiration for the Daily Mail, which has long highlighted the effects of sky-high care fees. Three years ago, we revealed at least 20,000 people a year have to sell up to pay their care costs, denying their children an inheritance. Yesterday, he told the Mail: ‘I praise the Daily Mail for its campaign on people having to sell their houses to pay for care. ‘We owe the Government’s original proposals to impose a cap on care costs very much to the Mail’s sustained and splendid campaign. I’m sure the Mail will continue to campaign until the Government changes its position.’ David Lipsey, a former political editor of the Economist and Labour policy adviser, was created a life peer in 1999. However, Mr Cameron’s spokesman said: ‘£23,000 is the starting point because that is the means-test threshold. For those who have assets that are separate from their home, what is the level above which they should make some contribution? We are consulting on that.’ Care Minister Norman Lamb said: ‘No decisions have been taken. We’re listening carefully to all consultation responses and take seriously the concerns raised.’ However, he also suggested that anyone excluded had a ‘vast amount of money in the bank’. Last night, Lord Lipsey, the Labour peer and former member of the 1990s Royal Commission on elderly care, welcomed the apparent shift by the Government. He said: ‘It would be good if they raised the threshold substantially, but it would be best if they dropped it all together.’ The charity Age UK shared his concern about councils being given the power to sell an applicant’s house if a mistake was made in declaring assets, saying that it could deter pensioners from applying. However, a Tory health spokesman said local authorities already had such powers but only used them as a last resort. Ros Altmann, a former Treasury adviser on older people’s care, said: ‘People with £23,000 in the bank, that they have saved up all their lives, do not have “significant means”. Everything in the Dilnot proposals is being watered down and I kind of wonder what these reforms are going to achieve.’ A Downing Street source said: ‘The idea that anyone will have to sell their homes to pay for social care is simply scaremongering. ‘The Government is spending £1billion a year in order to ensure people can keep their homes, deal with the crisis left by the Labour Party, and help provide dignity for all in old age.’","Former minister Stephen Dorrell said plan was not delivering 'the objective the government set out'

A container holding $600 million worth of loose diamonds was left sitting with a gaping hole on the bottom in the same JFK warehouse where thieves stole $1.2 million in cash last week. In both instances, the crates arrived on Swiss airlines flights from Zurich. The latest raid has security experts claiming 'Swiss security has more holes than its cheese'. Security detail: Crates arriving on Swiss Airlines from Zurich have been the subject of security breaches twice in the space of a week . Up for the taking: On this occasion, $600M worth of diamonds were left open in Swiss airlines cargo container at JFK airport . 'Someone could have put their arm inside the cargo container and taken what was inside,' a source said. A New York Port Authority cop noticed the damaged cargo container on Thursday at around 1:35 pm just an hour after the flight landed. Although it was still sealed, the container 'had a gap of several inches on the bottom and parcels were visible inside.' This time there was up to $600 million worth of diamonds that were destined for jewelers in New York. There's hole in my box: A hole was found in a Swiss cargo container, similar to this one, and the loose diamonds could be seen sitting inside . Flawed security: Last week, $1.2 million in cash was stolen from the same hangar at JFK as this weekends cargo crate hole was discovered . SwissPort International Ltd, the Zurich-based cargo shipper, moved the container to a 'secure unpacking location' where officials compared the inventory inside with a shipping manifest. Incredibly, nothing was found to be missing. The company ships 3.5 million tons of cargo yearly on behalf of some 650 client companies and is active at 180 airports in 37 countries, according to the company’s Web site. Last weekend, thieves used a forklift to make a hole in the shipping container and were able to steal bundles of cash. The robbery wasn't reported for a further two days until the crates were opened at a branch of the Federal Reserve in New Jersey. Presumably, the thieves made off with all they could carry. A further $92 million dollars were left behind. Police believe the theft was an inside job. The FBI are planning to submit airport workers to polygraph tests to try and determine who carried out the brazen heist. Big raid: In 1978 a band of masked raiders stormed into the cargo terminal and bagged a reported $3.5 million. The U.S. currency, all used bills for which authorities have no serial numbers, was being shipped to the Chase Manhattan Bank in New York . The largest cash heist in JFK Airport history happened on December 11, 1978, when an estimated $5 million was stolen at the Lufthansa Airlines terminal. At the time it was also the largest cash theft to have been carried out on US soil and went on to be portrayed in the movie 'Goodfellas'. It is not unusual for airlines to transport large sums of money - with a single flight sometimes carrying more than $1 billion.","Hole found in the bottom of a cargo container .

A mother has been shot dead allegedly by her estranged husband - a violent member of a whites-only biker gang who had previously threatened to peel her skin off  'layer by layer'. Jessie Doyle Cavett, 27, was shot in the head on Saturday at her home in Gresham, Oregon. Her ex Joshua Cavett, 36, has been charged with her murder. Mrs Cavett's five-year-old daughter Peyton was standing over her mother's body when police arrived at the scene. Joshua Cavett, 36, is believed to have shot dead his estranged wife Jessie and abducted their two-year-old daughter. The child was later found unharmed and Cavett arrested. His multiple police mugshots shows tattoos common with outlaw bikers and white supremacists . Living in fear: Jessie Doyle Cavett, a 27-year-old mother of two was shot in the head in front of her children. In August, she took out a restraining order against her ex-husband after he threatened to skin her alive . Mrs Cavett, a hair stylist instructor, died on Sunday at OHSU Hospital from her injuries. The father abducted the couple's two-year-old daughter Paige from the home causing an Amber Alert to be issued. Police who arrived at the scene said that Peyton had reportedly phoned a friend to tell them that 'Josh hurt mommy'. Cavett was arrested at 9pm on Saturday with a loaded gun in his backpack. The alleged shooter was tracked down with his youngest daughter to an apartment block a mile from where his wife was shot dead after people recognized him from the Amber Alert. The two-year-old girl was checked over in hospital but was unharmed. History of trouble: An early mugshot of Joshua Cavett (left) and right, with his first tattoos - biker gangs have long adopted Nazi symbols . Cavett, 36, is believed to have shot dead his estranged wife in front of her two children on Saturday at her Oregon home . Cavett allegedly told arresting officers: 'I'm not going to complain, I just (expletive) killed somebody.' The 36-year-old has been charged with . his wife's murder. He appeared in court on Monday for his arraignment, sitting behind plexiglass and flanked by two guards. He has pleaded not guilty to murder and two counts of felon in possession of a firearm. He is next scheduled to appear in court on October 22. He is known to police and has previous convictions for assault. Chilling: Cavett's estranged wife had taken out a restraining order against him in August after he threatened to tie her to a chair and peel off her skin . Mrs Cavett had been granted a restraining order in . August after her husband made a series of chilling threats. Mark Pitcavage, director of investigative research, at the Anti-Defamation League told MailOnline that the SS lightning bolt tattoo is often a sign of white supremacy. However in the context of outlaw biker gangs, some German/Nazi symbols were adopted long ago by the outlaw biker subculture - specifically the SS bolts, the Iron Cross and to a lesser degree, the swastika. As a result, if someone has one of these symbols, such as the SS lightning bolts, but it is known they are involved in an outlaw biker gang, the presence of such symbols alone is not sufficient evidence to label them a white supremacist. One of Cavett's neck tattoos explicitly identifies him as an outlaw biker gang member (the 1%er tattoo).  Cavett is a member of the Gypsy Jokers outlaw bikers gang, one of the prominent organizations in Oregon. Most of Cavett's tattoos are decorative or biker/GJ in nature. The brass knuckles tattoo on his right cheek is a cover-up tattoo of an earlier tattoo. The Gypsy Jokers are an outlaw motorcycle gang started in 1956 in Oregon. African Americans are not permitted membership to the whites-only gang. Mrs . Cavett, who was divorcing him, said that he had a history as a meth user and threatened to give her a 'hot shot' - a drug injection which would kill her. According to Oregonlive, she wrote in the restraining order request: 'He says he will hurt me or have me hurt . by someone else that no one will ever know. 'He will not . let me alone to be a mother.' She added that her husband wanted to torture her by 'tying me up to a chair to peel my skin off layer by layer'. She reported other abuse saying that in April he repeatedly hit her in the stomach and head. The 36-year-old father was banned from seeing his daughter Paige after his wife won sole custody. Kimberly Beddor, the owner of Bella . Institute in Portland where Mrs Cavett worked, told Oregonlive that the . 27-year-old had been trying to cut off ties with her husband. Ms Beddor added: 'She was a loving mother and an amazing friend ... who lost her life in a senseless, violent act.' Gresham Police are currently on the lookout for Keshia . Moritz, 28, who is believed to have witnessed the shooting of Mrs . Cavett. A man reported that Cavett turned up with the woman and a . young girl at his apartment.

Thousands of women across the country are turning their bodies into ATMs, selling their hair, eggs and even their breast milk to make ends meet as the economic recovery fails to bring wages and job opportunities back to pre-recession levels. Many of the women who are auctioning off pieces of themselves are middle-class mothers who are struggling to maintain the same standard of living for their children five years after the biggest economic crash since the Great Depression. Online market places have sprung up, making it easy for women to make up to $1,500 selling their locks and $5 an ounce for breast milk. Online marketplaces like Only the Breast have sprung up to allow women to sell their breast milk for up to $5 an ounce . The site buyandsellhair.com features hundreds of women, and a few men, who want to sell their locks . Selling eggs, which is a much more complicated and intrusive process, can net up to $8,000 per donation. Bloomberg reports that since 2011, the top Google auto-completion results for 'I want to sell my...' have included 'hair,' 'eggs' and 'kidney.' Google's fill-in results reflect the most popular searches by Google users. 'The fact that people even explore it indicates that there are still a lot of people worried about their financial outlook,' Nicholas Colas, who tracks economic indicators for ConvergEx Group, told Bloomberg. 'This is very much unlike every other recovery that we’ve had. It’s going to be a slow-grinding, very frustrating recovery.' Selling kidneys is illegal in the United States, though evidence suggests that black market organ sales exist. A University of Chicago study suggested that kidneys could be worth more than $15,200 each, if sales were legalized. Egg donation, which is much more complicated and requires several trips to donation clinics, can bring $8,000 per donation . April Hare, a 35-year-old mother of two who has been out of work for two years, resorted to selling 18 inches of her auburn hair to help support her family. She told Bloomberg she cut off her long locks and posted them on the website buyandsellhair.com for $1,000. She had several responses within hours. Hare, who has a four-month-old son and a seven-year-old daughter, said she is also looking into selling her breast milk. A similar site, onlythebreast.com, allows mothers to list their milk for sale online. It can go for up to $5 an ounce. 'These are tough times. The rich are getting richer and everybody else is losing their jobs and their homes. It’s just terrible,' she said. She previously worked as a sales manager before losing her job in 2011. Bridie MacDonald, from the wealthy Detroit suburb of Farmington Hills, Michigan, cut off her red locks and posted them online for $1,500 after she lost her job last month.","The top Google results for 'I want to sell my...' have been 'kidney,' 'eggs' and 'hair' since 2011 .

Legal attempts by Casey Kasem’s three adult children to gain power of attorney over their ailing father received a major blow on Tuesday after a judge said he saw no urgent need to intervene in the affairs of the 81-year-old who is battling advanced Parkinson's disease and early onset dementia. Kerri, Julie and Mike Kasem staged a very public protest outside their father’s home earlier this month to publicize their concerns for his well-being and to accuse their step-mother Jean Kasem, 59, of blocking them from seeing their father. Julie Kasem filed a petition last week for a temporary conservatorship, to have someone placed in charge of the legendary radio hosts's affairs who would give regular updates to a judge. Jean Kasem has hit back at her husband's children from his first marriage and claims she and Casey, pictured here in 2007, have been helping to fund their lifestyles for many years . She and her siblings say the legal action isn't about money – as they've already been cut out of his will - and is purely about concern for his well-being. But that story is contradicted by legal documents filed by their stepmom who insists she is taking great care of her ailing husband and continues to give him manicures and pedicures, reports TMZ. The legal documents also reveal that she and Casey have loaned his children approximately $100,000-$150,000 per year for many years to pay for their school, housing, cars, parking tickets, travel, etc. She also cited an example of a $50,000 loan that she claims was given to Julie back in 2000 and which has never been repaid. Julie Kasem, far right, filed a petition last week for a temporary conservatorship, to have someone placed in charge of the affairs of her father Casey Kasem . Lawyers for Jean Kasem also argued that if there is a need for a conservator, it should be his wife. On Tuesday, court-appointed Attorney Samuel Ingham told Judge Roy Paul that he had visited Kasem and did not see an immediate need for a conservatorship, although he did admit that he still lacked information about Kasem's doctors and treatments. Kasem, who lives with his wife of 33 years, Jean, and their adult daughter, has been checked out by police detectives and social services workers, said Marshall Grossman, an attorney for Mrs Kasem. Grossman urged Paul to reject Julie Kasem's petition, saying the effort was detrimental to his client and the radio host. A 2007 document that appointed Julie Kasem as an overseer of her father's medical care had been superseded by 2011 estate planning documents, said Grossman, who filed the records in court on Tuesday. Kasem gained fame with his radio music countdown shows, 'American Top 40' and 'Casey's Top 40,' and was also the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon 'Scooby Doo' Casey Kasem and wife Jean have been married for 33 years . Grossman called the new documents . ‘bulletproof’ and in a court filing wrote that the radio host's . intention was to receive medical care in his home. In a sworn declaration, Jean Kasem wrote that the actions of her step-children, including press conferences, accusations she is holding her husband hostage, and the filing of the conservatorship case, have been a ‘living nightmare.’ She wrote that her husband is bedridden and receives around-the-clock care from medical professionals. ‘It is my sincere hope that Casey's physical surroundings coupled with the attentiveness of the medical providers and the love of his own home and wife and child are comforting to him,’ Jean Kasem wrote. Paul refused to dismiss the case, noting that Ingham had requested additional information about medical care. The judge noted, however, that it did not appear that any court intervention was necessary to ensure Kasem was receiving proper care. Earlier this month Kasem's children and other friends staged a very public protest outside his home to publicize their concerns for his well-being and to accuse their step-mother Jean Kasem, 59, of blocking them from seeing him . Paul appointed an independent doctor to review Kasem's medical records and to meet with him then report back to the court before a Nov. 19 court hearing. Attorneys for Julie Kasem supported the delay in the case for the medical evaluation and further investigation of her father's estate planning documents. They declined further comment. Kasem gained fame with his radio music countdown shows, ‘American Top 40’ and ‘Casey's Top 40,’ and was also the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon ‘Scooby Doo.’","A judge has turned down a petition by Kasem's children from his first marriage to grant them a temporary conservatorship .

Staff at the hotel, where rooms cost as . much as $200 per night, have refused to explain how Ganjian was allowed . to stay at the hotel for so long while accruing the massive debts. But they finally began eviction proceedings after she filed for bankruptcy in June and she must now leave by October 24. Ganjian explained that after she lost her job, she had no choice but to move into the luxurious hotel as she has no family, no friends were able to take her in and she could not get a loan. 'Home': A Wisconsin woman, Jana Ganjian, has been living at the Racine Marriott (pictured) for nine years after a disability forced her to leave work and eventually led to her losing her home, she said .

Dull: Sir Elton John (pictured here in 1968) was branded 'dull and pretentious' by BBC talent scouts . The short, geeky singer with the glasses failed to impress the BBC’s talent spotters. He was a dull performer with a thin voice, they declared. As for his songs, they were pretentious. Rather embarrassing, in hindsight, for the BBC’s Talent Selection Group, as their subject was Elton John. The year was 1968. They were equally scathing about David Bowie, who they wrote off as amateurish and out of tune. The future superstars were among aspiring artists dismissed by BBC talent spotters in the early days of their careers, documents have revealed. All were required to have an audition in front of the now defunct selection panel before they were allowed to perform on radio and TV shows. The Rolling Stones also fell foul of the panel, rebuffed in 1963 as ‘unsuitable for our purposes’. Elton performed three songs in front of producers – All Across the Havens, Lady Samantha and Skyline Pigeon.  They said: ‘The items are not songs. Pretentious material, self-written, sung in an extremely dull fashion without any feeling and precious little musical ability. Thin, piercing voice with NO emotion. Not a tuneful voice.’ A producer added: ‘He writes dreary songs and he sounds like a wonky singer.’ Despite the appraisal, a tape of Elton John’s audition was passed on to BBC bosses, who agreed he would be able to perform. Bowie was not so lucky in 1965. He performed a version of Chim Chim Cher-ee, from the Mary Poppins film. Scathing: The reviewers wrote David Bowie (pictured here in 1966) off as 'amateurish and out of tune' How wrong could you be?  David Bowie (left) has an impressive career behind him while Elton John (right) has a wildly successful career and performs all over the globe . Who they liked...And who they didn't . The producers said: ‘Amateur sounding vocalist who sings wrong notes and out of tune.’ The Who turned up in February 1965 with two members arriving 25 minutes late. ‘Not endowed with much sense of urgency,’ wrote the producer.  ‘Overall, not very original and below standard.’ Simon and Garfunkel and Nick Drake impressed, but Marc Bolan’s music was described as ‘c**p, and pretentious c**p at that.’ The verdicts are revealed in a Radio 4 documentary Auditioning For Auntie, due to air next week. Marc Bolan's music was described as 'c**p, and pretentious c**p at that' The BBC’s head of popular music during the 1960s, Donald McLean, said of the ‘Civil-Service-style’ talent spotters: ‘They were nice people, but very old fashioned. The man I had to persuade to give me the budget and the air time to get a John Peel series had made his name by writing a book called Poultry Keeping For Profit.’ Another reject, Judy Dyble, a singer with Fairport Convention, described the audition process as ‘like being interviewed for a job, with three people sitting behind a table. It was still in those days when BBC technicians wore lab coats’. Before the launch of Radio 1 in 1967, the BBC broadcast little more than two hours a week of recorded pop music. Shows on BBC Radio’s The Light Programme such as Saturday Club, The Talent Spot and Top Gear were virtually the only place for pop performers to get exposure in the early 1960s.","Elton John labelled a 'dull performer with a thin voice'

The study rated key aspects of care including support for families and control of symptoms breathlessness (posed by model) The controversial Liverpool Care Pathway has little clinical benefit for dying patients, according to a major new trial. Based on findings published in The Lancet, the researchers suggest that any initiative to replace the Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP) in England should be 'grounded in scientific evidence' and tested in controlled trials before it is implemented. The LCP was jointly developed by the Marie Curie Hospice Liverpool and the Royal Liverpool University Hospital in the late 1990s with the aim of rolling out the best practice of hospices to hospitals, to provide uniform, high-quality, dignified care for dying patients in the last days or hours of life. However, its effectiveness for improving care for the dying has not been assessed in a randomised trial until now. In the study, The Liverpool Care Pathway Italian Cluster Trial Study Group assessed the impact of the Italian version of the LCP (LCP-I) on the quality of care of adult patients dying with cancer and their families in 16 general medicine hospital wards across Italy. Wards and palliative care teams chosen at random, were trained in the LCP-I programme or to follow standard healthcare practice. Bereaved family members of cancer patients were interviewed within four months of their relative's death, and the quality of end-of-life care assessed using a scale of 0 to 100. They rated key aspects of care including information and decision-making, co-ordination of care, support for families, and control of symptoms such as pain and breathlessness. No significant differences in the overall quality of care between the wards in which the LCP-I was implemented and the control wards was noted. And two dimensions assessed - respect, dignity, and kindness and control of breathlessness - also showed some improvement in the LCP-I wards. No significant differences in the overall quality of care between the wards in which the Italian version of the LCP was implemented and the control wards was noted . However, no differences in survival times between patients in LCP-I and control wards were noted. Study leader Dr Massimo Costantini said: 'Although we found no significant difference in overall quality of care for those on the LCP-I ward, we did see a small improvement. This could indicate that the LCP-I may have the potential to close the gap between hospice care and hospital care as we know families rate quality of hospice care more highly. While the results of this trial should be interpreted with caution because there were slightly fewer participants than expected, and we observed some variability in implementation of the LCP between the hospitals, this is a robust trial and the findings should be used to inform strategies to care for dying patients. 'There could be fundamental components of the LCP that might be beneficial, and the next steps are to establish this.' Professor Irene Higginson, co-author of the study and Director of the Cicely Saunders Institute at King's College London, said: 'Our findings demonstrate just how important it is for any initiative that replaces the LCP in England to be grounded in scientific evidence and tested in controlled trials before being rolled out across the board. 'We must face this challenge head-on and ensure scientific evidence forms the foundations for any new initiative if end-of-life care is to be genuinely improved for patients and their families in England.' Commenting on the findings, David Currow, of Flinders University in Australia, and Amy Abernethy, from Duke Clinical Research Institute in the USA, said: 'Across healthcare there is a need to improve care for people who are dying, which has led to widespread uptake of the Liverpool Care Pathway before adequate assessment. 'A decade after widespread uptake, the results of this, the only adequately powered study of LCP so far have not shown clinically meaningful differences for patients - the ultimate measure of useful health policy.'","Study compared care provided under the Italian version of the LCP and hospitals that do not implement the program as end of life care in Italy .

Hillary Clinton has taken a jab at Vice President Joe Biden by questioning his support for the Osama bin Laden raid. The dig marks an important line of offense for Clinton as Biden would be her strongest competition if they both decide to run as the next Democratic nominee for president in 2016. At a conference in Atlanta on Tuesday, the former Secretary of State told a version of events where she was in favor of giving the Navy SEAL mission the go-ahead to kill the terrorist but Biden was more uncertain. Competitors: Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden (Seen here together in 2011) are widely considered the most likely candidates for the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016 . Clinton spoke at the National Association of Convenience Stores and a politician in the audience told the local paper about what she said. 'I know she’s running for president now, because toward the end, she was asked about the Osama bin Laden raid. She took 25 minutes to answer,' state representative Tom Taylor told the Atlanta Journal Constitution. 'Without turning the knife too deeply, she put it to (Vice President Joe) Biden.' No press was allowed inside the event, but Taylor reported that she portrayed herself as being one of the strongest supporters of the raid- alongside then-CIA director Leon Panetta. In the room: Clinton said that she was in support of the May 2011 raid while Biden was more cautious and concerned . By contrast, she mentioned that Biden was against the raid multiple times during the speech. The success of the raid is a significant and Clinton knows it: Bill Clinton even talked about Obama's decision to give the raid the go-ahead during a campaign TV spot during the 2012 re-election. Neither Clinton nor Biden have officially announced that they're running to take over the White House after President Obama's second term ends in 2016, but their actions have been speaking for them. Clinton has made a number of speeches at conferences after taking a break from the public eye following the end of her term as a cabinet member in January. Picking sides? Many read into President Obama's decision to be interviewed for the first time after being re-elected alongside Clinton instead of Biden . Publicly supportive: Vice President Biden spoke at the Clinton Global Initiative conference late last month, as the event is run by his possible rival and her husband . As she was leaving office, she sat down for a televised interview along with President Obama, and that was viewed in political circles as a silent endorsement by her former competitor as he chose to have Clinton in that interview and not his vice president. Biden has been doing his own campaigning, however, as he attended a function in the crucial primary battleground state of Iowa last month. Even still, that might not be enough as three of President Obama's top aides have all publicly stated that they think the Democratic nomination belongs to Clinton. 'I think that Hillary Clinton probably will be the candidate. If she doesn't run, I think Biden will run,' former senior White House advisor David Axelrod said in a June interview according to Politico.","The former Secretary of State spoke out about the decision to order the Navy SEALs to kill Osama bin Laden .

The glare of the setting sun during rush hour is to blame for 36 deaths a year, a report from the AA warns today. The danger is particularly high now as autumn turns to winter and the sun sets at around 6pm –  just as most drivers are heading for home. It plays a part in nearly 3,000 accidents every year with drivers at risk of being temporarily ‘blinded’ by the dazzle of the sun on the windscreen. The glare from sunset is to blame for 36 deaths a year, the AA report reveals. Posed by models . The AA says the risk will continue until British Summer Time ends on October 27, when the clocks go back. The biggest danger is on minor roads. The AA report says that of the 2,905 accidents in which sun dazzle was reported to be a factor last year, 52 happened on motorways, 1,203 on A-roads, 428 on B-roads and 1,222 on other minor roads. AA president Edmund King said most drivers were sensible enough to slow down when they are dazzled. ‘But where a dazzling sunset gets particularly nasty is when the road turns unexpectedly into it or  the glare appears from behind  trees or buildings or by reflection,’ he said. ‘Drivers can’t gamble that it will change quickly – in the couple of hundred yards that takes to happen, there may be a pedestrian, cyclist  or jogger. ‘Likewise, overtaking into low sunlight when the road ahead is obscured is risking disaster.’ The AA also points out that the rate of head-on crashes involving lorries nearly quadruples in twilight conditions. ‘If the vehicle casts a long shadow in front of it, it is very likely that oncoming drivers and those coming out of turnings will have difficulty seeing it,’ says the report. The AA says that the danger of sunset coinciding with the rush hour poses different challengers for different road users. It urges drivers to ‘watch the backs’ of joggers, dog walkers and pedestrians as these groups are almost twice as likely to be killed or seriously injured in road accidents if they have their backs to the vehicles. The AA says its own research based on official 2004 pedestrian casualty statistics, shows that 10.8 per cent of the 5,566 pedestrians killed or seriously injured when in the road were walking or running with their backs turned away from the traffic. This compares with 5.9 per cent of casualties who were directly facing oncoming cars.","Glare of the sun causes nearly 3,000 accidents a year .

Fuel duty in remote rural areas will be slashed by 5p a litre under plans to be put forward by ministers this week. Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander will apply to the European Commission for permission to vary the fuel duty rate in 15 remote parts of the country. If approved, petrol and diesel prices in these areas will be cut by 5p in recognition of the higher cost of supplying fuel to remote areas. Fuel duty in remote rural areas will be slashed by 5p a litre under new plans . Similar rules already apply in the Scottish islands, the Isles of Scilly and other island communities in Europe. But the EU has never approved the scheme for use in mainland areas. AA president Edmund King has warned the scheme would be ‘very difficult’ to design. He said there was a risk it could create a postcode lottery in the countryside, with motorists given a perverse incentive to drive to remote areas to fill up. But the Treasury insists the scheme is simply designed to bring relief to motorists facing some of the highest fuel prices in the country. Mr Alexander, whose Scottish Highlands constituency may benefit from the scheme, said: ‘I want to do everything I can for those in remote areas and I will be taking the case to Brussels.’ The Treasury invited fuel retailers in 35 parts of the country to submit evidence about their costs earlier this summer. Most of the areas are in Scotland, but the review included parts of Wales, Northern Ireland and England. English counties included Devon, Cumbria, Herefordshire and North Yorkshire. In Wales, Gwynedd, Powys, Monmouthshire and the Isle of Anglesey were also included. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander says he will do 'everything he can' for people in remote areas . Treasury sources stressed that only ‘very remote’ areas, rather than entire counties or regions, were likely to qualify. The final list will be published later this week. The European Commission has approved a number of fuel rebate schemes, but they have always been restricted to island communities. The Treasury argues that the cost pressures in some remote mainland areas are identical. But they concede they face a tough fight in Brussels to get the proposals through. Sources dismissed the idea that motorists would be encouraged to drive to remote areas to fill up if the discount is approved. ‘The criteria are very strict,’ a source said. ‘The areas have to be sufficiently remote that there would be no profit from driving there to fill up. ‘There is no precedent for this in Europe in a mainland area. We are pushing the boundaries and it is going to difficult to get it through. But we think there is a good case for it.’ The limited scheme would only cost the Treasury a few million pounds a year, but Mr Alexander argues it would give remote rural communities a valuable boost. Britain has one of the highest levels of fuel duty in Europe, although Chancellor George Osborne has pledged to freeze it until the election to help motorists.","Treasury chief secretary to apply to the European Commission for varied fuel rates .

As the pheasant shooting season gets into full swing at Sandringham, there is growing concern about a fresh outbreak of a sickness which has struck down dogs walked in woodland on the Queen’s Norfolk estate. At least a dozen pets have been hit by seasonal canine illness (SCI) in recent weeks after being exercised there. The news is a blow for the Queen, who thought her woods were in the clear after a previous outbreak. She has authorised a new study by the Animal Health Trust charity to try to identify the cause of the illness, which has been blamed on harvest mite larvae. Sandringham house: The Queens country residence near Kings Lynn, Norfolk . The charity has arranged for dog owners visiting Sandringham to get free doses of an anti-mite spray which they can apply to their pets directly before walking in the woods. In return, owners will have to take part in a survey to see if their pets suffered any sign of sickness after being walked on the estate. The trust hopes that if all dogs that receive the treatment escape unscathed, then it will provide definitive proof that SCI is caused by harvest mites. The pilot project is being carried out only at Sandringham which was first hit by the illness three years ago. Blow: The news that the sickness bug has returned will be a blow to the Queen . Royal shooting parties are as much at risk as casual dog walkers. SCI affected 22 dogs at Sandringham last year; the previous year there were 51 cases and three deaths; and in 2010 there were 35 cases and six deaths. The survival rates are thought to have improved due to publicity raising awareness of the illness and the Sandringham estate putting up signs warning dog owners to watch out for symptoms. Natural History Museum botanist Dr Mark Spencer suffered an infestation of harvest mite bites on his leg after walking through undergrowth while examining woodland at Sandringham in 2011. Buckingham Palace has refused to confirm or deny if the Queen has stopped exercising her beloved corgis at Sandringham because of the illness. It is thought that royal shooting parties which use Labradors to retrieve pheasants have continued as normal. It’s enough to have the ladies reaching for the smelling salts — apparently Boris Johnson’s trademark rumpled appearance owes more to art than nature. That at least is the view of Have I Got News For You’s Paul Merton. The comic says of the London Mayor: ‘He’s a very shrewd man who realises that no one fears the buffoon.’ Of Johnson’s appearances on the quiz show, Merton adds: ‘He’d leave make-up with his hair meticulously combed, disappear round the back of the set and then walk on with his hair all over the place. I think he has a mirror in his pocket to make sure that it’s always attractively tousled.’ Tim and Malin Jefferies with their daughter Coco . As the father of two young children, Mayfair gallery owner Tim Jefferies has had to make some adjustments in his life. Now another change is underway — his gorgeous Swedish wife Malin has given up modelling to be a stay-at-home mother. And Tim is delighted. ‘I’m glad she’s done it, but it was her decision,’ he tells me at the PAD Arts fair in Berkeley Square. ‘We have two children and she wants to concentrate on that.’ Jefferies, 51, has been linked to a string of beauties including Koo Stark, Claudia Schiffer, Kylie Minogue and Sophie Dahl. He met Malin, 37, on a blind date in 2006 and they married two years later. Coco, four, arrived the following year and Rex is almost two. ‘Coming home to a calm family life after some of the different sort of people I have to meet  is absolutely peachy,’ says Tim, who lives in Holland Park.  ‘Would I like more children? You bet. Having children has changed my life. I’ve never been so happy.’ Hollywood star Robert Redford’s film-maker son James is planning to spend time in Britain researching his family’s roots. ‘My quest into our family tree started after a trip to Scotland,’ James tells me at the launch of his documentary The Big  Picture: Rethinking Dyslexia — inspired by the struggles of his son, Dylan, 22. ‘I was amazed to see lots of red-haired people walking around who looked just like me and Dad! It was weird.’ James has already discovered a British ancestor called Charles. ‘He was a musician, so showbusiness must run in the blood,’ he says. Deep thinker: Even though Roy Hodgson has a busy schedule, he still found time to wish his friend a speedy recovery . England football manager Roy Hodgson had much on his mind yesterday, not least how his team would fare in the vital World Cup qualifying match against Poland at Wembley . But he still found time to text his friend, playwright Sir Ronald Harwood, wishing him a speedy recovery from a recent heart attack. ‘Roy lives in Richmond and often comes to see my plays when they are put on in the town’s theatre,’ says Harwood, who found fame with The Dresser and received an Oscar for  The Pianist. ‘He’s a lovely man and not at all like the image some people have of football folk. ‘A deep thinker, interested in society, history and world affairs. 'It’s typical of him to remember me at the most important moment in English football history for quite a while.’ In football speak, Sir Ronnie was ‘over the moon’ to get Roy’s text as he dined in a Chelsea restaurant. He’s given up one country pile — famously dubbed Beckingham Palace — and is renting a £20 million house in West London. But apparently David Beckham has been casting his eye over another mansion, Great Durnford Manor in Wiltshire, former home of Prince Charles’s pal, Lord Tryon. It’s on the market at £18 million and comes with river frontage and a partridge shoot. But it does have some unhappy memories. Tryon sold the place after the death of his ex-wife Kanga, Charles’s confidante and lover, who died at 49, having never recovered from falling out of the window of a drugs clinic.

Patients could soon have to pay for ‘hospital extras’ such as better food or IVF, a top GP has warned. Michael Dixon, president of the NHS Clinical Commissioners and chairman of the NHS Alliance, said doctors had to consider introducing new charges to balance the rising costs of treatment and an ageing population. He said patients were already charged for prescriptions and hospital parking, so other services should also be considered. Dr Dixon, who represents the GP-led Clinical Commissioning Groups, said: ‘We need to start discussing the real taboo subject of the NHS, which is co-payment. No one wants to discuss it but it is already happening. 'Patients pay for parking, the television sets on the wards and if you want to see an osteopath, you have to pay yourself. ‘The very wealthy are doing it already by accessing the NHS when it suits them and going private when they don’t.’ But he added the NHS ‘never allow an NHS patient to live, die or go bankrupt depending upon how much he or she can pay’. At a Westminster Health Forum event on the future of the NHS yesterday, Dr Dixon said the service is facing a £30billion funding gap in ten years. He said: ‘If someone wanted a surgical procedure or medicine that didn’t have a proven benefit they could pay for that and also for someone else to have another treatment. ‘Things like car parking or television sets are fairly easy, then on the edge of that, what about dining-room extras like food, or more comfortable beds? ‘I don’t think we should be too afraid of this discussion because the alternative is rationing where no one can have it.’ Dr Dixon added: ‘It’s about being inventive in how we create income in the health service so that we can get more resources to look after patients and don’t continue going back to taxpayers saying “can you give us more”.’ Nurse serves lunch for a patient in a hospital. Picture posed by models . GP-led Clinical Commissioning Groups, which replaced Primary Care Trusts earlier this year, were given £65million by the Government to spend on local health services. The reforms are intended to cut bureaucracy, reduce costs and foster competition, encouraging private firms and charities to take on health service contracts. In August, Dr Dixon said hospitals will have to shrink or close altogether in the wake of new reforms that have given GPs control of more than two-thirds of the health service’s budget. He said that diagnostic tests, outpatient appointments and much of elderly care should be moved to local clinics to improve services and save money.","Dr Michael Dixon, chairman of NHS Alliance, gave the warning .

The Royal Veterinary College commissioned the sculpture of Sefton, whose recovery from the blast which killed seven stablemates and four soldiers captured the nation's hearts. The college's artist in residence, Camilla Le May, was handed the task of sculpting the black gelding and has created a three quarters of a ton sculpture, showing him walking briskly.

Princess Anne, will officially unveil the sculpture outside the college's teaching and research centre in North Mymms, Hertfordshire, today . Anne, whose love of horses is well-known, will officially unveil the sculpture outside the college's teaching and research centre in North Mymms, Hertfordshire, today. Many people who knew and rode Sefton provided detailed briefings to help award-winning Ms Le May capture the horse's character and spirit. The 39-year-old, from Wadhurst, East Sussex, said: 'It was fascinating to talk to those who rode and knew Sefton and this, along with studying old photos, enabled me to find out some of his individual traits, such as the way he often tilted his head, looking back over his shoulder, which I chose to represent in the work. 'He was by all accounts a strong character and quite a handful, especially in his youth. Perhaps it was partly this strength of character that helped him pull through his appalling injuries.' The statue was commissioned to honour one of the RVC's longest-serving senior academics, Professor Peter Lees, who retired in 2010. It was funded by RVC honorary fellow Lord Ballyedmond. Stoic: Sefton being prepared for an X-ray at the army's veterinary centre at Melton Mowbray after his injuries . Jonathan Forrest, development director at the RVC, said: 'Artistic inclination is a good thing within the scientific professions and scientific understanding is a good thing for an artist. 'For vets, the use of hands and eyes is critical; similarly for a sculptor.' He added: 'We chose Camilla as we felt her approach was particularly suitable, being based on animals and where anatomy and the underlying structure are key.' After joining the Army, Sefton became a riding school horse before joining the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment. Following the bombing, and despite 34 separate wounds that required eight hours of surgery, Sefton recovered and was able to return to service where he became famous for battling against the odds. The aftermath of the IRA bomb explosion at Knightsbridge Barracks, London . The animal, who served with the British Army for 17 years from 1967 to 1984, went on to win Horse of the Year - a prize his rider on the day of the attack, Sergeant Michael Pedersen, picked up on his behalf. Sefton also became one of the first horses to be placed in the British Horse Society's equestrian Hall of Fame and has an annual prize named after him. It is believed his life was saved by a guardsman who ripped off his shirt and used it to staunch the flow of blood to his neck wound. A second blast two hours later in Regent's Park killed another seven soldiers. Veterinary surgeons gave Sefton a 50/50 chance of surviving the shock and extreme blood loss, but the brave animal recovered after surgery which saw nearly 30 pieces of shrapnel extracted from his body. During his treatment, Sefton received thousands of gifts from the public and he was back on regimental duty less than three months later. He finally retired from the Household Cavalry in August 1984 and was moved to a sanctuary in Buckinghamshire. Sefton was put down at the age of 30 in July 1993 due to lameness - a complication of the injuries he suffered during the bombing. Professor Stuart Reid, principal at the RVC, said: 'As a symbol of resilience and recovery, Sefton really is an inspiration and will live long in the memory of those who knew him. 'The piece created by Camilla is a true testament to Sefton and I'm sure will be admired by many visitors to the college in years to come.'","Sefton survived the blast, which killed four soldiers and seven horses .

'In my wildest imagination growing up, I don't think I could have ever envisioned the daywhere something I created would live inside a Disney theme park,' Cameron said. His special effects teams have been working with Disney to come up with the new technology needed to make the park a reality. The attraction will have rides and nighttime shows based on the film, according to Time. But the biggest draw will be the interactive experience it offers. Creative: The landscapes of the Oscar winning film are being recreated at Disney's Animal Kingdom . Ground breaking: From left, director James Cameron, Disney Parks chairman Tom Staggs and Disney designer Joe Rohde with a model of the theme park . 'Above and beyond the key attractions, the land of Pandora itself is filled with experiences the land comes to life when you interact with it and seems to be a living creature itself,' Disney imagineering executive Joe Rohde said. 'The sheer beauty of the forest at night, all the beauty, all the wonder, the scale and grandeur you remember from that film' is what we can expect, Mr Rohde said. With its ground-breaking CGI and 3D visual effects, Avatar became the highest-grossing film of all time, earning $2.7 billion worldwide. Interactive: Tourists will be able to stroll through the glow-in-the-dark forests of Pandora . Lush: The forested landscapes from the movie will be a central part of the Disney attraction . It was such a hit that Cameron is currently working on three sequels, due to be released in 2016, 2017 and 2018, according to Yahoo. 'In the world of Avatar, guests will encounter awe-inspiring floating mountains and wander through a night-time jungle of bioluminescent plants that are alive with light and sound,' Walt Disney parks chairman Tom Staggs said. 'Guests will also discover what it feels like to soar into the sky riding a banshee,' he added.","Fans of Oscar-winning film will be able to visit interactive attraction .

The second victim in the outrageous Missouri high school rape case has come forward, telling how she was sexually assaulted at the same time that her friend Daisy Coleman was being attacked in a nearby room by an older high school football player. The girl, who has only identified herself as Paige, said that she was with her friend when they went over to meet up with a group of boys but they fought back when the boys started to attack them. Paige, who was with Daisy on the night of . the January 2012 attack, spoke about the attack for the first time on . CNN tonight with her mother, Daisy, and Daisy's mother all by her side. '(Daisy) had texted Matt Barnett because . Matt Barnett wanted to see her... so we snuck out and we got there and I . was immediately separated from her and taken into another room and . sexually assaulted after I said no and pushed him away,' she told CNN's . Erin Burnett. Victim: Daisy Coleman (right) was found by her mother Melinda (left) after she was allegedly raped by a boy from her high school and he has not faced any charges . Breaking her silence: Paige (left) is Daisy's friend and was with her when she was attacked. Another boy also sexually assaulted Daisy and she remembers the horrible incident . Taking action: The girls and their mothers deny that they refused to cooperate, as the sheriff has said. That was the reason why he said that the boys involved were never charged . Paige did not name her 15-year-old attacker but said that unlike Daisy, she remembers all of the details of the attack. 'After he was done and we went out to the . living room we waited for Matt to come out with Daisy and he opened the . door and I saw Daisy and she was incoherent- couldn't talk, couldn't . walk, couldn't do anything.' Paige went on to talk to Al Jazeera America who posted an edited transcript of their interview on their website. 'They drug [sic] her out of his bedroom window, drug [sic] her to the car, and then they were going to drop us off, but they were freaking out, trying to think of how they were going to drop us off without any of her brothers waking up,' she told Al Jazeera. Opening up: Paige, seen here with her mother, said that the ordeal was 'very scary' 'They took her and carried her to the back corner of her house and left her there. And they told me to go inside, that all she needed to do was to sober up, and that she would be okay, and they were gonna be there and watch her. 'It was very scary. I was really confused and didn’t understand what was fully going on. I was in shock and really worried about my friend. It was freezing out. I don’t know. There was just a lot of things going through my mind.' Daisy Coleman became suicidal after she was allegedly raped at age 14, then tormented by cyber bullies, her mother says . Daisy . was 14 and Paige was 13 at the time of the attack and the boys have . never been charged because the local sheriff in Maryville, Missouri . claims Daisy would not testify. Daisy . denies his claims, saying that she was never asked to testify or else . she would in hopes of getting her attacker- Matt Barnett- behind bars. The girls stories have been corroborated by the evidence- including an iPhone video of the attack that one of Barnett's friends took that night. Now Daisy's mother Melinda is continuing to put pressure on the sheriff's department, saying justice was denied when Nodaway County's prosecutor dropped felony charges against the two 17-year-old boys involved in Daisy's alleged rape. 'How do you think we didn't want to cooperate?' Coleman asked. 'We went to get a rape kit done. I wrote a statement, and my daughter gave a statement to the police.' Coleman said that no depositions were conducted before the felony charges were dropped. She said she was asked but refused to invoke the Fifth Amendment before a planned May 31, 2012, deposition. Nodaway County prosecutor Robert Rice issued a statement saying there wasn't enough evidence to pursue the charges because the accusers had stopped cooperating and asserted their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination, but now the state's Lt. Governor is getting involved. Friends: Paige, seen at left with Daisy at right, said that she remembers the night of the attack because the boys made Daisy drink much more than she had to . Better times: Daisy has said that she started self harming and tried killing herself following the attack . On Tuesday night, Peter Kinder put out a statement calling for another investigation into the case. 'The appalling facts in the public record shock the conscience and cry out that responsible authorities must take another look. I call on Attorney General Koster and Prosecutor Rice to join me in asking that the Circuit Court convene a grand jury to review all the evidence, hear all witnesses, and issue a decision as to whether charges should ensue,' Kinder wrote. In an interview, Sheriff Darren White backed up Rice's statement. The case has drawn new attention since The Kansas City Star published the results Sunday of a seven-month investigation into the allegations. The . Star's story described a town where many appeared to be closing ranks . around the accused and suggesting the girls were somehow responsible for . the incident.

The charred remains still stand months later of the fire-damaged home of Melinda Coleman and her children at 27932 S. Scout Drive in Maryville, Missouri . In April, after the family had moved, the family's home in Maryville was damaged in a fire, though a cause has not been determined. Robert Sundell, an attorney who represented the teen accused of assaulting Daisy Coleman, said in a written statement that while many may find his former client's behavior 'reprehensible,' the legal issue is whether a crime occurred. He said the investigation raised questions about whether the 14-year-old was 'incapacitated during the encounter.' He also said the charges were dropped after the accusers' stories changed during depositions.Coleman says her 14-year-old daughter was given alcohol in January 2012 and raped by a 17-year-old acquaintance. Accusations: Daisy, pictured left with her brother, told police that she became so drunk she couldn't remember anything at a party thrown by several older high school boys . Paige, Daisy's 13-year-old friend says . she was forced to have sex with a 15-year-old at the same house, while . another 17-year-old allegedly recorded the incident on a cellphone. The . daughter acknowledged she and the friend left her house to meet the . boys but said they gave her alcohol and she doesn't remember much of . what happened next. The boys said the sex was consensual. The two 17-year-old boys were charged as adults, but Rice dropped felony counts against them several months later. A misdemeanor count against the teen accused of assaulting Daisy was dropped subsequently. The prosecutor cited a lack of evidence and the Colemans' refusal to cooperate. The 15-year-old was charged in juvenile court.

'They stonewalled the case all by themselves,' he said. Now that the family is saying they will cooperate, he wasn't sure whether that would make a difference. 'They . wouldn't cooperate and then they said they would cooperate. And then . they wouldn't cooperate. And then they went back and forth,' White said.

We have all been there: waiting for ages for a bus only for it to eventually come, followed by two more right behind it. It's a cliche because it's true - and here's the website that finally proves it. Designed by web developer Matthew Somerville, the Live London Bus Map shows exactly where buses in the capital are at any given moment. With red dots symbolising buses and yellow ones representing bus stops, the map gives live updates about every bus route in the capital . Buses are bunched in groups on the number nine bus route along High Street Kensington in west London . Would-be passengers can pick their bus route and then see how far away the next bus is from their stop. And . while using the map will give blessed relief to everyone who's waited . at a bus-stop, looking anxiously up the road wondering where the bus is, . it also proves that they really do come in threes... or even fours. Mr . Somerville, 33, came up with the idea after designing a similar live . map for the Tube, showing where London Underground trains were. Someone . emailed him out of the blue asking if he would create a map for London . buses, and so he used the same code he'd written the Tube map to design . one for buses. Buses really DO all come at once - here, three number 74 buses (red dots) are bunched up in Putney . This screenshot show four buses on the 137 bus route close together on Streatham Hill in south London . You've waited ages, and then you spot this... but Matthew Somerville's website will ease your pain . Using data . from Transport for London (TfL)'s Countdown live bus arrivals service, . Mr Somerville created a map showing all the bus stops (yellow dots) and . buses (red dots) with a pop-up menu where you can choose which bus . number you're waiting for. Data . from every bus' GPS is fed into a central system operated by TfL, which . uses it to calculate each bus' expected arrival time at each bus stop. Mr Somerville's live map uses this information to plot his map. Unevenly spread: This map of the 63 route through south London shows a long gap with no buses on it at all . The Birmingham-based web developer said he had noticed the phenomenon known as 'bunching' whereby there are long gaps between buses and then several come at once. He said: 'What tends to happen is that the bus at the front has more people to pick up and so gets delayed, while the bus behind it has fewer people to pick up so it gets ahead, which causes them to group together.' Wikipedia has a whole page devoted to bus-bunching, also known as clumping, convoying or platooning, and has several theories as to why it occurs. As well as the most obvious theory, upheld by Mr Somerville, other suggestions include drivers going at different speeds, and drivers adjusting their speed deliberately so that other buses pick up more people than they do. The number six bus, which runs along Oxford Street and Edgware Road, shows buses bunched in places . Three at once: A grab of the live map for the 131 bus shows bunching in Wimbledon . A Transport for London spokesman told MailOnline bus bunching did occur and they had staff devoted to regulating gaps that might occur. He said: 'We have one main control centre for the bus network and smaller sub-centres where staff have access to real-time information about where the buses are. 'If there are gaps or hold-ups, the control centre can communicate verbally with the drivers and via a screen to regulate the service. 'Ways of doing this include holding buses at stops, or diverting buses from a route where several buses may have been held up at roadworks and sending them on ahead so there's a more frequent service for those waiting along the route.' There are around 8,500 buses operating in the capital, stopping at 19,000 bus stops, all of which are represented on the map. TfL says around 2,500 bus stops have dot matrix boards giving countdowns until the next bus, and they plan to increase that number.","New Live London Bus Map shows exactly where buses in the capital are .

Heavily-armed federal agents have raided a white supremacist family's Arizona compound and seized dozens of weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition. Kirby Kehoe and his son Cheyne, 37, are known for allegedly trying to establish a whites-only nation within the United States. Both men are convicted felons and legally barred from possessing firearms. More than 50 agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives geared up on Tuesday and raided the family's 40-acre ranch near Ash Fork, Arizona, about 140 miles north of Phoenix. Locked and loaded: ATF agents wore heavy armor and carried assault rifles when they raided the compound belonging to two white supremacists . ATF agents, fearing that the Kehoe family would resist violently, went in with armored vehicles and called up 50 agents . Both Kehoe men were arrested without incident, though the family has a violent past. The Kehoe family has been well-known to law enforcement since the . 1990s when authorities say they provided weapons to various white . supremacists who committed robberies across the Midwest. Authorities . also said the family was involved in a plot to overthrow the federal . government and establish the Aryan Peoples Republic in the Pacific . Northwest. Another son, Chevie Kehoe, is serving a life sentence . in federal prison for his role in the 1996 killings of an Arkansas gun . dealer, his wife and their 8-year-old daughter as part of the plot. Cheyne Kehoe, who was arrested Tuesday, served prison time in 1998 after a shootout with police in Ohio . Cheyne . Kehoe was sentenced in 1998 to more than 24 years in prison for his . role in a shootout with Ohio police during a traffic stop about 40 miles . northeast of Cincinnati. His sentence later was reduced to 11 years. No . officers were injured in the gun battle, but a passer-by was wounded by . a bullet fragment. The family patriarch, Kirby Kehoe, was . sentenced in 1999 to nearly four years in prison for racketeering and . possession of illegal weapons in a case related to the plot aimed at . overthrowing the government. The elder Kehoe, however, has maintained he . was never involved in his sons' efforts to establish a whites-only . nation and that he isn't a racist. Mangan said due to the violent . nature of the family's past, authorities planned the Monday raid . carefully, first setting up surveillance on the property before moving . in with search warrants, heavily armed tactical teams and armored . vehicles. He said the raid was conducted in cooperation with law enforcement from around the country and was planned to avoid the potential for a violent confrontation. 'The reason and rationale for having executed the warrant on the property in that manner was driven by public safety, just based on the past history of this individual and the sons,' Mangan said Tuesday. 'When a traffic stop was being conducted in Ohio, it turned into a nationwide manhunt, and we obviously didn't want to revisit that issue.' Kirby Kehoe is due back in court Thursday for a preliminary and detention hearing. Cheyne Kehoe's next court appearance is set for October 22. Chevie Kehoe, the second Kehoe brother, is in prison serving time in connection with the murder of an Arkansas family .","Kirby Kehoe and his son Cheyne were arrested by ATF agents at their 40-acre Arizona ranch .

Forget the 'Bank of Mum and Dad' - grandparents are subsidising their grandchildren to the tune of more than half a billion pounds a year, according to a new study. Researchers found a fifth of grandparents in England aged 50 or over give money to their grandchildren, and the figure totalled £647 million in 2010. Grandparents who give are more likely to be homeowners than renters and more likely to have lower or no mortgage debt, according to the research. Helping hand: A fifth of grandparents in England aged 50 or over give money to their grandchildren, and the figure totalled £647 million in 2010 . The study by the International Longevity Centre-UK (ILC-UK), supported by Key Retirement Solutions and Partnership, highlights how grandparents are playing a vital role in supporting future generations. The report - Grandparental Generosity - looks at the levels and patterns of financial support from grandparents using the 2010 English Longitudinal Study on Ageing (ELSA). Just under 2.5 million grandparents in England aged 50 or older gave money to their grandchildren. Contributions to Child Trust Funds (CTFs), tax-free savings accounts for children available from 2005-2010, were made by one in 25 grandparents (3.99 per cent). Grandparents who give are more likely to be homeowners than renters and more likely to have lower or no mortgage debt . Across England, grandparents gave a cumulative total of almost £333.8 million to their grandchildren in 2010. Almost £313.8 million was contributed to CTFs. Seventy five to 79 year olds gave more than from any other age group, but 80 to 84-year-olds gave the highest amount on average. Grandparent givers are also more likely to provide care for their grandchildren, and be female and married rather than separated or divorced. Grandparental givers are wealthier than non-givers. The research reveals that grandparent givers are typically well-off and are likely to have substantially higher incomes from private pensions. Degree holders gave a much larger amount on average compared to the other groups. Brian Beach, research fellow at ILC-UK, said: 'This research reveals that millions of grandparents are providing financial support to younger generations. 'For grandchildren, these transfers are likely arriving at a crucial transition point, impacting educational and housing opportunities. 'As people live longer and society ages, grandparental giving may have an increasingly important impact on the social mobility of grandchildren.' Ged Hosty, managing director of Equity Release at Partnership, said: 'As families become increasingly financially stretched and time-poor, grandparents are stepping in more and more to provide support. 'However, while this trend is to be welcomed as it helps to draw families closer together, it can put a strain on the grandparents finances that they may struggle to recover from. 'Therefore, it is vitally important that people consider all their assets - including their homes - ahead of retirement and take steps to ensure that they can provide as much help as needed without detriment to their own retirement aspirations.' Dean Mirfin, group director at Key Retirement Solutions, said: 'It is evident that with extended generations increasingly amongst today's population that grandparents are opting to help with their grandchildren, not just in terms of time but also financially. 'Grandparents in many cases are taking a pragmatic view with regard to this financial support seeing it as inheritance at a time when money is needed most or has the potential to most influence the financial well-being of the rest of their families. 'For many being there to witness the impact of their support is a key driver to gift at the right times, and to direct how that support is used, and this is a trend we expect to see continue.'","20% of grandparents aged 50 or over give money to their grandchildren .

Two 20-foot-deep disposal pits opened in western South Dakota on Monday to help ranchers dispose of tens of thousands of cattle carcasses littering the countryside since an early October blizzard decimated herds. Up to 4 feet of snow fell in the Black Hills area during the storm, killing at least 10,000 to 20,000 head of livestock, state officials say. The South Dakota Stockgrowers Association estimates this part of the state lost at least 5 percent of its cattle, which is mostly raised for beef. Ranchers are encouraged to bring carcasses to the sites in Pennington County, which were built to state Animal Industry Board guidelines, in an effort to prevent the contamination of waterways that can come from home burials. Decimated: Cattle stocks were decimated in western South Dakota last week as a freak blizzard took ranchers by surprise, killed tens of thousands of heads . 'Some people might decide to bury their losses right where they are,' Alexa White, public information officer with the county's Emergency Operations Center said Monday. The . number of dead cattle will likely rise as more losses are documented. Last week's rain added moisture to pastures already saturated by the . quickly melting snow, making it difficult for ranchers to traverse the . vast terrain to assess losses and tend to stressed but surviving . animals, said Silvia Christen, executive director of the Stockgrowers . Association. 'The . priority right now is taking care of the livestock that made it through . the storm,' Christen said. 'Once it dries up, ranchers will focus on the . disposal.' Another . snowstorm heading into the Black Hills on Monday was expected to bring . up to a foot of snow, threatening to complicate the soggy mess. Dead where they stood: As many as 20,000 cattle are thought to have died where they stood. Now the state has dug two 20-foot pits for their disposal . Dangerous: Tens of thousands of cattle still litter the South Dakota countryside and officials are pushing for proper disposal instead of home burials that can contaminate water . Animal Industry Board rules require . carcasses to be burned, buried to a depth of 4 feet or disposed of by a . licensed rendering plant within 36 hours of death, though South Dakota . Gov. Dennis Daugaard has waived the standard timeframe, recognizing the . difficulty in meeting that deadline. The . burial sites are located in the eastern part of Pennington County with . access to Interstate 90, but that could be a 100-mile-plus drive for a . rancher raising cattle in Buffalo County. 'They want to make sure they're not in streams and stuff, because they can contaminate the water,' Kantack said. The . pits are dug specifically to avoid such health problems, as burial . sites must be at least 1,000 feet from surface water, floodplains, . rivers or private or public drinking water wells. Burial . is also prohibited when the primary subsurface material 20 feet below . the bottom of the pit is primarily sand or gravel or when the depth to . an aquifer is less than 20 feet from the bottom of the pit. Black . and bloated carcasses of cows still lie rotting in the thousands in . scenes more akin to an apocalyptic nightmare than the aftermath of a . snowstorm. But with no federal livestock disaster program in place, many ranchers were left wondering how they would survive the setback. Scarred: Today their black and bloated corpses still scarred the picturesque flatlands to the west of the Roughrider State as the cleanup began . Nightmare: A cow lies dead in the snow in scenes more like an apocalyptic nightmare than the aftermath of a blizzard . 'The worst I've ever seen': Josh Schumaker, 27, left, and Karl Knutson, 25, ride through pasture as they survey the damage to their herd . 'This is the worse than I've ever seen for loss of livestock,' said rancher Karl Knutson, 25, who works on his family ranch east of the town of Sturgis, as he began counting his losses. 'Some people were very well prepared and lost 50 per cent of their herd,' said state veterinarian Dustin Oedekoven told CNN. 'Some were not prepared and took no losses. There was no rhyme or reason to it. Some ranchers lost everything.' 'It will be two weeks to a month before we have a better idea of the impact,' he added. Gary Cammack, who ranches on the prairie near Union Center about 40 miles northeast of the Black Hills, said he lost about 70 cows and some calves, about 15 percent of his herd. A calf would normally sell for $1,000, while a mature cow would bring $1,500 or more, he said. 'It’s bad. It’s really bad. I’m the eternal optimist and this is really bad,' Cammack, 60, said. 'The livestock loss is just catastrophic. ... It’s pretty unbelievable.' On top of the vast swathes of cattle killed in the blizzard, many also wandered off as powerful winds blew them far from their home pastures.

Inquest: Declan Gatenby, 13, who was found hanged at home after he had his mobile phone confiscated . A 13-year-old boy hanged himself in his bedroom after his mobile was confiscated by his parents - but he may not have meant to kill himself, an inquest heard. Declan Gatenby had been told to hand over his phone, described as being usually 'glued to his hand', after he had got into trouble at school. But on the day before it was to be given back he became upset when his father refused to relent. He ran up to his bedroom and was later found hanged by his nine-year-old brother Jordan. The coroner at his inquest said he believed the teenager had hoped his younger brother or father would follow him and find him in time. Declan, from Rossendale, Lancashire, was a 'typical teenager' who was described as 'cheeky and mischievous,' his parents said. In a statement his 31-year old father Wayne Gatenby told the hearing in Burnley: 'He was a typical teenage lad. He pushed the boundaries as may be expected and got into trouble at school on a few occasions - but nothing terribly serious. 'We had no problems with him, nothing gave us huge cause for concern.' But the inquest was told Mr Gatenby and Declan's mother Donna, 32, decided to ground their son and his mobile phone was taken away from him for a week. In the day before his death he was allowed to go out and see his grandmother who lived close by, before watching films with his younger brother Jordan, nine. On the day of the tragedy on July 7, Donna left for work as a kitchen assistant at a care home at 11.30am and Warren was at home with the two boys. Bereft: Warren Gatenby (left) and Donna Gatenby (far right), the parents of Declan Gatenby, outside Burnley Coroner's Court following the inquest into their son's death . Upset: Declan's family home, where he was found hanged by his nine-year-old brother after a row with his father . He said: 'It was a hot day and they were in and out of the house, they came in and out, watched TV with me and went out again. At 5.30pm Declan asked if he could have his phone back.' The Burnley inquest heard Mr Gatenby told his son it wasn't due back until later and he said Declan 'wasn't happy about it' and got up and left the room. He added: ''He was due to get it back on the Monday, the day after. He got up and left the room. 'I heard the front door to the house open and close and presumed he had simply gone out. I thought he accepted it and made his way outside.' Grief: Outgoing Declan's death shocked his family and friends and led to graffiti tributes like this one . Shocked: The 13-year-old, pictured with a puppy, was a happy young man and his death could not be predicted, his inquest heard . Jordan later went to the room he shared with Declan to find the body of his brother. Mr Gatenby alerted by his youngest son ran upstairs and tried to revive his eldest son but in vain. Ambulance staff arrived minutes later but could not save him. Tragedy: On being told he would not get his phone back Declan went up to his room he shared with his younger brother who later found him dead . Mr Gatenby told the inquest the family had not been aware of any problems within his school life and inquires that were made showed that there had been nothing significant to note. He added: 'There was nothing days or hours beforehand that made me think for even one minute that anything was wrong. I still find it so difficult to believe. There were no signs he was depressed or wanting to hurt himself in any way.' Recording a verdict of misadventure, the coroner Richard Taylor told the family: 'I'm sorry you have had to relive this today but we have to do it to make it as straightforward for you without ignoring the importance of an inquest. 'I cannot imagine what you have had to go through over these last few months, my sympathies are with you all. Whether Declan deliberately took his own life I cannot come to that conclusion for a number of reasons. 'Whilst he has done a deliberate act, I would have to conclude that his intention was to end his life by doing that, and that is a step too far. 'I cannot believe that is what he wanted to do, a happy-go-lucky teenager showing no signs of him ever considering something like this. 'I feel the appropriate conclusion I should draw is one of misadventure. It is the unexpected outcome of a deliberate action, yes he has done something, but I do not believe for one moment that he actually intended to end his life. 'This is why I asked the question about the front door being open and shut, he may have expected someone to come upstairs after him.' Declan's family were too upset to comment after the hearing, At the time of the tragedy they told how he would enjoy fishing, magic tricks, BMX biking and skateboarding and had been about to try out for the athletics team at school. In the weeks before the tragedy the family had just returned from a holiday in Menorca where Declan had learned to swim. In an interview at the time of his death Mr Gatenby said: 'When he was at home he was quite outgoing, but when he was out and about he was a bit shy really. He was always playing games on his mobile, you'd think it was glued to his hand.' Declan's grandmother Lynn Love said: 'He was very loving, there are no words to describe how much he will be missed. I didn't realise how many people knew him. Lots of people have passed on their sympathies, he had a bit of mischief to him. 'You only had to look at that face to wonder what he had been up to.'

This chilling CCTV image shows the desperate flight of a man who had just stabbed two Big Issue sellers to death in a frenzied city centre knife attack. Paranoid schizophrenic John Ward, 23, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility after killing Wayne Busst, 32, and Ian Watson-Gladwish, 31, in Birmingham on January 11. He has been jailed for life today. Appearing via video-link from high-security Ashworth Hospital at Birmingham Crown Court, Ward remained impassive as Mrs Justice Thirlwall sentenced him to serve a minimum of 12 years in jail. Getaway: This is the moment Ward runs away from his dying victims, having thrown the murder weapon away . She said Ward was an 'exceptionally dangerous' man, adding: 'I do not know whether you will ever be released.That will be a matter for others.' Peter Grieves-Smith, prosecuting, described how commuters watched in horror as Ward plunged a 8-inch knife into both his defenceless victims earlier this year. Jailed: John Ward, 23, was jailed for 12 years today at Birmingham Crown Court for killing two defenceless Big Issue sellers . Heroin addict Ward had met the pair, both fellow drug-users, for the first time a few hours before after getting off a train from London. Ward, originally from Ireland and at the time an undiagnosed paranoid schizophrenic with a dissocial personality disorder, later told psychiatrists he had heard voices 'screaming in his head' telling him to kill himself. He told Dr Panchu Xavier, at Ashworth Hospital, 'he didn't want to do anything but ""the voices wanted me to kill everyone"",' Mr Grieves-Smith said. Arriving in Birmingham, he bought a kitchen knife at a supermarket which he said was for his own protection, along with whisky and later purchased a bag of heroin - which he smoked. He met with Mr Busst and Mr Watson-Gladwish and despite getting on well with them for several hours, he struck without warning. Afterwards, he told Dr Xavier at this point, 'the voices were going mad, screaming at me ""kill yourself"".' 'The voices were saying ""kill random people"",' he said . Just before the attack, a commuter had seen Ward 'acting strangely'. Ward struck Mr Busst first, inflicting a 16 cm chest wound struck with such force it damaged the bone. As . his first victim cried for help, Mr Watson-Gladwish tried to intervene . and was stabbed twice, once in the abdomen and also fatally to the . chest. Neither men had any defensive wounds.

Before: A CCTV image shows John Ward buying a kitchen knife from a supermarket hours before he killed . Meet: John Ward, second from the left, can be seen befriending Wayne Busst, third from left, on the day of the attack while Ian Watson-Gladwish can be seen in the bottom right corner . Passers-by, including an off-duty nurse, tried to help the men and later two doctors and paramedics attempted open heart surgery on Mr Busst, but to no avail. Meanwhile, Ward threw away his knife and fled to a nearby Odeon cinema where he sat and wiped blood from his face and hands with napkins until the police arrived to arrest him. A staff member later told police: 'His eyes were wild, like a rabbit caught in headlights.' The court heard Ward had a history of violence and had recently attacked a nurse at Ashworth. Talk: Ward, left, speaks with Ian Watson-Gladwish, right, as he sells the magazine on the streets . In Ireland, in 2011 he was convicted of robbery and later the same year assault, receiving suspended jail terms for both, said Mr Grieves-Smith. He added the reason Ward left London for Birmingham that day, was after a row with his mother in which he had punched her in the face. In mitigation Michael Duck QC said his client's background had seen him grow up in Ireland in an abusive household, surrounded by alcoholism and drug-taking. He said Ward had started drinking at age . nine, was taking heroin by his early teens and was later taken into care . where he was sexually abused. Stop: The man makes his way into the Odeon cinema in Birmingham to try to evade police . 'From a very young age he reported hearing voices, which was a clear marker of the very significant mental health issues he's suffered and the tragedy is it's been picked up rather later in life, and we find ourselves now in this situation,' said Mr Duck. Afterwards, the family of Mr Watson-Gladwish said no sentence would ever account for their shared loss. Mr Busst's family said: 'It's hard to . put into words how we feel at this time but it's true no parents should . have to bury their child. 'There is little we can say about today's verdict as it will never bring Wayne and Ian back to their families.' Arrest: The man is pictured being detained at the cinema - where he had cleaned the blood of his victims from his hands moments before police arrived . Detective Sergeant Mike Griffiths, of West Midlands Police, said the 'chilling reality' was that Ward's mental illness meant anyone could have been targeted that day. 'He was and still is an extremely dangerous man,' he said. The two men's deaths prompted soul-searching from John Bird - the man who founded Big Issue - who said it had raised 'very big issues' about the safety of sellers. In an interview with the BBC, Mr Bird said he knew first-hand how vulnerable people on the streets were to such random attacks adding the organisation had 'weathered' the trauma of the men's deaths only with the support of its vendors and the public.","John Ward, 23, stabbed Wayne Busst, 32, and Ian Watson-Gladwish, 31, to death in Birmingham City Centre in January .

England's castles and abbeys are among the best-preserved in the world and attract millions of visitors a year. But the country risked losing these important pieces of history until the invention of the humble petrol lawnmower, the head of English Heritage has said. Simon Thurley, chief executive of the organisation, said its invention in 1913 allowed sites to be maintained more easily and ensure historic venues could be opened up to the public for the first time. English Heritage chief executive Simon Thurley said the invention of the petrol lawnmower helped sites be maintained more easily and open them up to the public for the first time . Mr Thurley (pictured) said the petrol lawnmower was a 'really important' invention . Before then England was lagging behind other countries in the protection of key sites. But the lawnmower helped pave the way for state care of England's most treasured monuments. Between 1913 and 1939, 600 buildings were brought under the Government's responsibility. It came after the introduction of the Ancient Monument Act in 1913, which gave architect Sir Charles Reed Peers the task of turning them into a 'museum of history' by opening them to the public. The lawnmower helped pave the way for state care of England's most treasured monuments. Above, a copy of the Ransomes' Lawn Mower catalogue, printed in 1901 . 'There was a really important invention . that made it possible for him to open these homes out to the public - . this was the petrol-powered lawnmower,' Mr Thurley was quoted in the . Daily Telegraph as saying. It is 20 years since English Heritage was formed, taking over from the Office of Works, and 100 since the introduction of the act. It is now the steward of over 400 significant historical and archaeological sites, including Stonehenge. Mr Thurley said as well as the lawnmower, the advent of the car was crucial as it allowed people to travel longer distances. English Heritage now looks after hundreds of historic sites, including Stonehenge (pictured) Speaking at Henley Literary Festival, Mr Thurley said people should remember the landowners that fought to protect England's heritage. The protection of historic buildings was enshrined in the 1913 Ancient Monuments Act. Mr Thurley said: 'Everybody realised it could not be left down to individuals. 'I think we have to look back to those landowners who fought for heritage protection in 1913 and what they did for us.'","Simon Thurley said invention in 1913 allowed sites to be maintained easily .

The new Crimewatch appeal focused on a claim by an Irish family that they saw a man carrying a child through Praia da Luz at around the time Madeleine McCann was found to be missing. Two differing e-fits of the suspect were issued, and police say it is possible the family did see the three-year-old being spirited away by her abductor. The sighting came when Martin Smith, a retired businessman in his 70s, was walking back to his apartment in the Algarve resort following a meal and drinks at a bar with his wife and children. The Metropolitan Police have issued this e-fit picture of a man who they believe may be connected with Madeleine McCann's disappearance . At a spot a six-minute walk from the McCanns’ holiday accommodation, they saw a man carrying a blonde child aged around four. It was just before 10pm and the street lighting was poor. Although Mr Smith admitted he was not wearing his glasses at the time he later said he thought the man could have been Gerry McCann. This is an impossibility as dozens of witnesses confirmed he was at the holiday complex at . 10pm. British police have also said they are certain that Mr McCann has nothing to do with his daughter’s appearance. Speaking to Portuguese police a few weeks after Maddie disappeared, Mr Smith said it was ‘not possible to recognise the individual’. His grandchildren were also unable to identify the man or the girl – but thought she could have been Madeleine. Yet in September 2007 Mr Smith suddenly called police again to say he believed the man he saw could have been Gerry McCann. He had been watching television coverage of the family returning to Britain. However numerous witnesses say they were with Mr McCann at the tapas restaurant at the time in question – so he could not possibly have been 500 yards away. This has led to Mr Smith’s account being called into question. The retired businessman from County Louth, Ireland, was staying in Praia da Luz with his wife Mary, now 65, his son Peter and his wife and their children. He part owned an apartment in the resort and visited it three times a year.

Police have set up an eBay account to sell the beloved jewellery of a convicted drug baron for up to £3,200 an item. Detectives decided to sell watches, gold chains and necklaces seized during their investigations into one legged former cagefighter Vincent Graham. A luxury £100,000 sports car seized in Salford is also set to be up for grabs soon. The extravagant items, which were bought by Graham from his proceeds of crime, are now being snapped up with the money raised to be spent catching other gangsters. The initiative - from Titan, . the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit - is the first time a police . unit has raised funds in this way. Father of ten Graham, 35, who was nicknamed 'Big Vin', lived a lavish lifestyle after becoming the head of an organisation which dealt cocaine smuggled into the UK from South Africa. He posed semi-naked on online dating sites and dated a string of women , seduced by his lavish five-bedroom home and string of supercars. But his empire collapsed after Graham was arrested and questioned over a kidnap plot in the Netherlands. Dutch police freed him without charge but then contacted police in the UK urging them to carry out a series of raids on properties connected to Graham amid suspicions they were being used to deal Class A drugs. Officers discovered 25 kilos of benzocaine - a chemical used to dilute cocaine - in a house in Liverpool which if used would have produced enough cocaine to sell for more than £1m. It emerged Graham paid £1,500 in cash a month to rent a five bedroomed luxury house worth £500,000 in Lancashire in an exclusive development opposite Blackburn Rovers’ training ground. He had a fleet of nine cars including a Lamborghini Gallardo, worth more than £40,000, a Nissan Skyline, worth £35,000, and an Audi Q7 worth more than £20,000. The police squad officially set up their own 'bling and buy' account on eBay after seizing watches, gold chains and necklaces during their investigations into one legged former cagefighter Graham . The extravagant items, which were bought by Graham from his proceeds of crime, are now being snapped up with the money raised to be spent catching other criminals . Searches at various premises owned or rented by Graham recovered £5,000 in cash. Motorbikes, jet skis, quad bikes, off-road motorbikes, electrical goods, jewellery and artwork together worth over £150,000 were found in his garage. Examination of his bank accounts showed cash deposits totalling over £35,000 and no evidence of the payment of household bills from his bank accounts. Also seized was a £50,000 Jacobs watch and a £32,000 diamond necklace. During a police surveillance operation officers watched as Graham would check his Nissan GT-R’s wheel arches with surgical gloves. In July 2011, Graham, described by police as a 'significant player' in the supply of drugs in the North West of England, admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine and was jailed for seven years. He was later ordered to pay back 700,000 under a Proceeds of Crime hearing and was warned he faced a further four and a half years jail if he didn’t pay up. Police said Graham’s haul of jewellery was the first to be put up for sale on Ebay with luxury items seized from others including a £100,000 supercar to be posted on the site later. Each of Graham’s gems has a full description and was independently validated as genuine by an experienced jeweller. Graham's £1,700 bracelet seized by police.

A white gold diamond set ring on offer for £350 is described: 'Condition Fair, slightly misshapen scratched and scuffed and rhodium plating worn.' Det Supt Jason Hudson, head of operations at Titan which cracks down on organised crime said more 'bling and buy' auctions would follow soon. He said: 'This is just the start of us selling the ill-gotten gains of convicted major criminals and re-investing the proceeds back into tackling others like them. 'Expensive jewellery, luxury furniture, fast cars - these trappings of wealth are things that most ordinary people can only dream of yet serious organised criminals have been enjoying them while blighting communities with their drugs and violence. The initiative - from Titan, the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit - is the first time a police unit has raised funds in this way . 'Law enforcement agencies are using the Proceeds of Crime Act and court confiscation orders to their full potential and hit criminals in the pockets as well as with prison. By using ebay we hope to sell criminals’ assets at the highest price we can. 'Titan tackles some of the most serious organised crime groups operating in the region and we are expecting to be able to auction off lots of other high-value things in the coming months, which can only be good news for our communities.' Half of the money from the auction will be split between Titan and the region’s police forces, the Crown Prosecution Service and Her Majesty’s Courts Service. The other half will be returned to central government. In July 2011, Graham, described by police as a 'significant player' in the supply of drugs in the North West of England, admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine and was jailed for seven years . The court heard former garage boss Graham, who gave up his cagefighting career after he lost his right leg in a motorbike accident in his 20s, never touched the drugs during transactions .

The number of complaints about doctors made by their colleagues or patients is on the rise, according to new figures. Data from the General Medical Council (GMC) shows a jump in both patient complaints and the number of doctors willing to speak up about the poor standards of other medics. In 2012, the GMC received 8,109 complaints - a 24 per cent increase since 2011 and a 104 per cent increase since 2007. New figures have revealed the number of complaints made about doctors is on the rise . The new data reveals that between 2007 and 2012, the overall number of complaints from the public rose by 87 per cent to 5,014. While most came from patients and their friends and relatives, a significant amount were made by doctors' employers and concerned colleagues. The GMC, which regulates around 250,000 doctors in the UK, said the overall number of complaints is very small when the number of interactions between doctors and patients is taken into account. The Council said the high expectations of patients and willingness of some doctors to point out areas of concern compared to others should be taken into account when considering the rise. Overall, 54 per cent of the complaints were about clinical care and communication with patients. Many made by doctors (38 per cent) concerned conflict of interest or criminal convictions held by their colleagues. Among the public, people aged 46 to 60 were the most likely to complain, with women more likely to speak up than men. GPs were more likely to be complained about than other doctors, and male medics were twice as likely to attract criticism than their female counterparts. Twenty-two per cent of male GPs received a complaint compared with just 11 per cent of female GPs. The number of doctors aged over 50 who were complained about was higher than for doctors aged 30 to 50. Female GPs were less likely to be complained about than their male colleagues, according to the study. Posed by models . This was particularly true for GPs, the State of Medical Education and Practice report showed. A third of all complaints received met the threshold for a full investigation by the GMC, but only 20 per cent of those lodged by the public satisfied the same criteria. Eighty-four per cent of all concerns raised by employers merited an investigation, as did 48 per cent of those made by doctors. Professor Sir Peter Rubin, chair of the GMC, said: 'Overall the standard of care that patients receive in the UK is good and doctors continue to deserve the trust and respect of the public. 'The GMC has an important role to play in protecting patients and ensuring that doctors practise to the highest possible standard. 'Complaints from members of the public, doctors and other professionals are invaluable in helping us to do this. 'Complaints also give the health service a chance to reflect and improve the care that patients receive. 'However what our report shows is that some patients don’t know where to go to raise a concern about their treatment and more needs to be done to help them raise issues. 'Making a complaint about a doctor can be stressful and it is important that concerns are raised with the right organisation so patients are not passed from pillar to post.'ends . Anna Bradley, chair of Healthwatch England, said: 'It’s no surprise that people don’t know who to go to with their complaint as the system is far too complex. 'Most patients and people receiving care don’t know the difference between the GMC, the Care Quality Commission and their local complaints advocacy services. They just want their complaint dealt with. 'But people aren’t just failing to report complaints because they don’t know where to go. 'We know from our own research that more than half of those who experienced a problem in the last three years didn’t report it because they simply didn’t trust the system to listen or take any action. 'We all have a right to safe, dignified and high quality care, backed up by an effective complaints system for when things go wrong. The Healthwatch network can play a central role helping people understand where to go with their complaint, making things as simple and straightforward as possible.'","General Medical Council report showed more complaints are being made each year .

Prison staff are to be issued with stab-proof vests to wear round the clock under plans being considered by ministers. An urgent review is being carried out into giving frontline staff ‘covert clothing’ to protect from knife attacks launched by prisoners. The number of prison assaults involving knives has doubled in a decade, with staff at risk of being deliberately attacked by inmates or getting caught up in fights. Protection: Prison officers could be given stab-proof vests to wear as part of their routine uniform (file picture) The idea of giving all prison staff stab-proof vests marks a significant u-turn, coming just two years after the government insisted it was not necessary. Protective vests and gloves are usually only used when trouble breaks out in jails or if prison officers believe there is a serious threat to their own safety. Last year there were 246 assaults on staff and inmates in prisons in England and Wales involving a knife or blade, up from 127 in 2002. There were also 126 attacks involving a sharp instrument and 325 using a blunt instrument. Last year there were 2,987 assaults on staff, a figure which has remained stubbornly high for the last five years. As recently as December 2011 the government insisted there were ‘no plans’ to routinely equip all prison officers working in prisons with stab-proof vests. But now prisons minister Jeremy Wright has revealed that the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) which runs the country’s jails is now ‘assessing the benefits and feasibility’ of issuing vests routinely. Growing problem: There were 246 assaults on staff and inmates in prisons in England and Wales involving a knife or blade last year, up from 127 in 2002 . He insisted that there NOMS has a ‘zero tolerance approach to violence within prisons and takes the safety of prison staff extremely seriously’. Mr Wright added: ‘Staff must be able to undertake their duties safely and be, as far as possible, protected from attack. ‘NOMS is currently assessing the benefits and feasibility of issuing front-line prison staff with covert clothing for routine wear, including vests which offer protection from knife slashing or stabbing. ‘Knife-resistant vests and other protective clothing are already provided to staff where a particular risk has been identified, including to specialist staff responding to serious incidents.’ He was responding to a parliamentary question from Tory MP Mark Menzies, who also urged ministers to consider the use of slash and needle-proof gloves by all prison guards. Mr Wright replied: ‘Slash-resistant and needle-resistant search gloves are currently available for staff use and local risk-assessment at individual prisons determines how widely they are used. ‘Work is on-going to identify further suitable products which may benefit prison staff in conducting routine searches.’","U-turn by ministers who had ruled out idea of vests being worn routinely .

The former Spice Girl's styles have inspired copy cat looks  - such as her well known 'Pob' (left) and her original long bob (right) The study by Fabriah.com found mere six per cent of women stick to the same hairstyle for life. The majority of the rest of us - 41 per cent - will change the cut every . two years, whereas 19 per cent change it yearly. Four per cent of women questioned change their look every six months. The most popular look for women was shoulder length hair - with 48 per cent of us returning to the mid length. A quarter of women prefer chin length cuts, six per cent prefer a crop, but 22 per cent prefer long hair. One respondent said: 'I tend to change my hair every few years but only very slightly. I may have a bit extra cut off the length, more layers put in or add a fringe. 'With colour I’m a bit more fickle – during the winter I like a warm, rich shade and in the warmer months something much lighter.'

James Clewes and his partner, Bernadette Chapman, stormed a Best One convenience store carrying a blade each. Clewes held the terrified cashier at knifepoint and demanded cash while Chapman stuffed the money into a bag along with stolen cigarettes. Scroll down for video . Behind bars: James Clewes, 32, and Bernadette Chapman, 27, have been jailed after holding up a convenience store at knifepoint . They fled the scene but, within a couple of hours, 27-year-old Chapman confessed what she had done to her mother, who immediately called police. The pair were arrested later that day at a nearby pub and have now been jailed following a hearing at Bolton Crown Court. Clewes, 32, of Bond Street, Bury, Greater Manchester, was sentenced to three years and four months behind bars after admitting robbery, possessing a bladed article and two counts of threatening a member of public with a bladed article. Bernadette Chapman, also of Bond Street, was jailed for two years and six months after admitting robbery and possessing a bladed article. Detective Constable Mick Yates said: 'Clewes and Chapman armed themselves with knives and used the threat of violence to terrify staff at the shop. 'By their own admissions it was a desperate act. 'It seems the reality of what they had just done quickly dawned on them and Chapman in particular was quick to confess. 'Faced with this revelation and an extremely difficult decision to make, credit must go to Bernadette Chapman's mother, who without hesitation called the police.' Clewes and Chapman raided the shop, in Bury, just after 7am on Thursday, May 23. As they tried to escape through the front door following the robbery, a member of the public tried to hold the door shut from the outside. After failing to get out through the back, the couple returned to the front and smashed a glass panel before running off. They were later linked to the crime through clothes recovered during a search of their house. Det Con Mick Yates said: 'I must reserve special praise for the witness who saw this robbery in action and bravely did everything he could to stop them escaping from the shop.' He added that this member of the public and Chapman's mother showed that 'there are members of our community who will not sit by and watch something criminal happen and who will not sit back in the knowledge that someone is responsible for such offences and do nothing'. He added: 'They have proven that the police and the public can work together side by side to bring criminals to justice.'","James Clewes, 32, and partner Bernadette Chapman, 27, raided shop in Bury, Greater Manchester .

"By . Becky Barrow . PUBLISHED: . 17:10 EST, 15 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:51 EST, 16 October 2013 . The price of a first class stamp will jump higher over the next three years . The price of a first class stamp, which has rocketed to 60p, will jump higher over the next three years it emerged last night. According to details buried in the Royal Mail’s prospectus, the newly privatised company still plans further price rises. This is despite the fact it admits the ‘substantial’ price increase from 46p to 60p in April 2012 did trigger a drop in the number of letters sent. The price shock comes after strict rules – which used to control Royal Mail’s ability to increase prices – were scrapped before the stock market float. The move was one of many changes, which also included allowing the company to dump a £12billion pension black hole on the taxpayer, that were made to prepare Royal Mail for a sell-off. As a result there is now no official limit on how much the former state monopoly can raise stamp prices, or a cap on how many times they can be increased each year. The only protection around stamps is the price of a second-class stamp, which costs 50p. Under rules, laid down by the regulator Ofcom, the maximum price which Royal Mail can charge for a second-class stamp is currently 56p. In its prospectus, Royal Mail said directors ‘expect any price increase to be broadly in line with RPI over the three financial years ended in 2016’. RPI is the retail prices index measure of inflation, typically higher than the more commonly used consumer prices index. For example figures published yesterday by the Office for National Statistics show RPI is 3.2 per cent, but CPI is only 2.7 per cent. Official forecasts, from the independent watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility, show RPI is predicted to be 2.8 per cent in 2014, 3.2 per cent in 2015 and 3.6 per cent in 2016. If correct, the price of a first-class stamp could hit 66p over the next three years. Royal Mail chief executive Moya Greene said the company has to be ‘very careful about pricing’. The price shock comes after strict rules were scrapped before the stock market float . She added: ‘I don’t think you’re going to see a company that is going to be senseless about the pricing lever.’ Miss Greene said Britain is in the ‘low to middle of the spectrum’ compared to stamp prices in the rest of the European Union and insisted Royal Mail must ‘retain the loyalty of our customer base’. Yesterday the Greetings Card Association said stamps are ‘really good value’ but it would ‘not be happy’ to see large increases. Last year’s price hike caused such furore that Royal Mail agreed to allow millions on benefits to buy stamps at the old price last Christmas. In another bid to pacify concerns, Royal Mail did not increase stamp prices in April this year.","Price of a first class stamp will rise again over the next three years .

One of over a dozen chimpanzees trained by the U.S. to beat the Soviet Union’s attempt to win the space race, Ham made history as the Cold War extended into orbit. As the Russians moved closer to sending a human into space, the Americans decided to use three-year-old Ham — in a style reminiscent of a gas-detecting canary in a mine — to find out whether humans would be able to survive in such conditions.

One of the funniest reviews on Amazon includes this helpful tip found at the bottom of this canvas print of Paul Ross . Amazon has rounded-up what it believes to be some of the funniest product reviews to mark its 15th anniversary in the UK. Pictured is the Amazon warehouse at Milton Keynes . Some of the products, and their reviews, have already become the stuff of legend, inspiring their own internet memes, such as the three wolf moon T-shirt, which sparked hilarious comments on the site. One such comment, as picked out by Amazon, was: 'Don't get me wrong, this T-shirt is ace. I just can't help thinking an additional Wolf wouldn't go a miss. '(P.S I've rated this 4 stars. 1 for each Wolf and 1 for the moon. If the seller wants another star, then I want another Wolf....or another moon)' Other well-known reviews include this effort for a box canvas print of Paul Ross: 'If you only buy one 20 inch canvas print of Paul Ross this year, this is the one to get.' A canvas clock of Eastenders actress Pam St Clement also received some memorable reviews, including: 'After purchasing this, time has taken on a whole new meaning in our house. As I type this, it is currently 5 past Pat's chin. Lovely.' The Kitchen Craft Banana Slicer is another product which has gained notoriety through its advert on Amazon. This canvas clock of Eastenders actress Pam St Clement received some memorable reviews . This t-shirt of three wolves howling at the moon has become so famous it has sparked its own internet meme . It's design and function inspired one customer to write this glowing review: 'Thanks to this revolutionary idea I can now purchase bananas free of fear. 'I used to stare longingly at bananas in my local supermarket, but I was afraid to add them to my shopping basket knowing I wouldn't know what to do with them when I got them home. 'Clearly too big to put into one’s mouth in one go, I couldn't for the life of me work out how to eat it. Now it is as clear as day, and I have joined the happy banana eating ranks. Thank you so much! 'I would have given this great product 5 stars if there had been banana peeling instructions included.' The children's book Mr Tickle inspired this rather long-winded literary analysis . To many customers, Amazon's product reviews have become one of the site's most useful tools. Pictured is Amazon's one million sq ft fulfilment centre in Fife . Elsewhere, Mr Men book reviews have attracted some of the most in-depth reviews of all the products to be found on the site. One review for Mr Tickle begins: 'Hargreaves' first work, and regarded by many as his masterpiece, Mr Tickle is something of a rarity amongst the Mr Men books. Elsewhere, we see much exposition on the pitfalls of excess - such as in Mr Greedy and Mr Messy, for instance - but a distinct lack of discourse on personalities that are over- rather than under-regulated... 'So what a glorious anomaly we find in Mr Tickle - a breath of fresh air from the unrestrained id.' One of the most famous reviews in the history of the site however, has to be incredibly detailed analysis of a Bic Crystal Ballpoint Pen, Medium Point, Black. The review begins: 'Since taking delivery of my pen I have been very happy with the quality of ink deposition on the various types of paper that I have used. On the first day when I excitedly unwrapped my pen (thanks for the high quality packaging Amazon!) I just couldn't contain my excitement and went around finding things to write on, like the shopping list on the notice board in our kitchen, the Post-it notes next to the phone, and on my favourite lined A4 pad at the side of my desk.'

Deserving: Alan Yentob defended his £330,000 salary while complaining about the amount of money the BBC pay top stars . With several lucrative BBC salaries to his name, he is known to envious colleagues as ‘Two-Jobs’. But it seems even fat cat Alan Yentob feels hard done by compared with some of the corporation’s biggest stars. The 66-year-old executive -  who is paid around £333,000 a year as the BBC’s creative director and arts presenter – has admitted he feels  uneasy with the amount its top talent is paid. Appearing in a panel discussion at the Radio Academy’s festival in Salford yesterday, Yentob agreed the ‘huge amounts of money’ thrown at presenters such as Graham Norton and Gary Lineker were unfair. During the question and answer session – which was aired on Radio 5 Live – he responded to angry comments made by radio listener Chris Jones, who complained he felt ‘betrayed’ by high levels of BBC pay. He also objected more generally to the huge salaries earned by top Premiership footballers such as Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney. Mr Jones said: ‘A lot of stars are paid huge amounts of money, and yet you’ve got Joe Public who earns around £25,000 a year, which to a lot of these people is nothing. 'Wayne Rooney plays football for a week, and I have to work 35 years to make what he earns for a week. How’s that fair? You’ve got the likes of Graham Norton and Gary Lineker [at the BBC].’ It is thought Graham Norton and Gary Lineker both earn about £1.5million a year at the BBC. Wayne Rooney – who does not earn a BBC salary – earns an estimated £15.6million a year from Manchester United and commercial endorsements. Mr Yentob attempted to defend BBC salaries by saying they were lower than those earned at its commercial rival ITV, but admitted: ‘I agree with you about what Wayne Rooney earns. I agree with you about what presenters of all kinds earn, including [5 Live presenter] Richard [Bacon] and I and others.’ Double dip: Alan Yentob is paid both for his job as an editor for Imagine, pictured presenting with singer Emeli Sande, as well as the position of creative director of the BBC . However, Yentob justified his own pay by saying he was ‘valuable’ to the BBC because of his ‘relationship with talent’ and ‘understanding of the networks and the schedules’. The arts ‘supremo’ is paid one salary of £183,300 as BBC creative director, and another as editor and presenter of arts series Imagine. He has refused to reveal how much this extra income is, and it is not declared on the BBC’s official register. But BBC insiders say it is ‘easily’ in the region of £150,000 a year. The executive is also understood to have accrued a pension pot worth £6million during his decades of working at the Corporation. Yentob also defended the huge earnings of Top Gear star Jeremy Clarkson, who raked in £13.3million by selling his production company to the BBC last year and also earns a salary of around £1million paid out of the licence fee. Yentob said: ‘Jeremy does make a lot of money. However, the franchise of Top Gear is the most successful factual programme in the world. So a large amount of money comes in, significantly more than anything Jeremy gets, into the BBC, and goes back into the licence fee through BBC Worldwide. There are in any society, any environment some people who do  particularly well but he is making money, and that format is making money, for the BBC.’ Salary: Helen Boaden, the head of BBC radio and the former head of news, takes home £340,000 a year . The BBC has been heavily criticsed for spending millions on salaries for executive and senior staff. Last month, MPs grilled seven managers, past and present, who earned a staggering £1.6million a year between them. The top earner was ex-director general Mark Thompson, who raked in £670,000 a year while Lucy Adams, human resources director, enjoyed a salary of £320,000. Last month it was also revealed that the . broadcasters had hired a string of executives on salaries of more than . £200,000 in the past 12 months. The BBC Trust commissioned a study of basic salaries in 2009 and found many were on a par with the those at top FTSE 100 companies. What the bosses are paid: . Tony Hall, director general: £450,000 . Anne Bulford, managing director of BBC operations and finance: £395,000 . Helen Boaden, director of radio and former head of news: £340,000 . James Harding, director of news and current affairs: £340,000 . Danny Cohen, director, BBC television: £327,800 . James Purnell, director of strategy and digital: £295,000 .

Other athletes who attended were racing drivers Jaime Alguersuari and Carmen Jorda. José María Álvarez del Manzano, the former mayor of Madrid between 1991 and 2003, and Ana Botellla, the current mayor of the capital were also at the service. Some mourners stood outside the church because there was no room inside. Maria De Villota died in her hotel room in Seville as a result of a crash at Duxford Aerodrome, in Cambridgeshire, last year, according to her family. Jaime Alguersuari was among sports personalities who said their last goodbyes to racing driver De Villota . Swimmer David Meca arrives at the church (left) and female racing driver Carmen Jorda (right) The 33-year-old, who lost her right eye and suffered serious facial injuries during her debut test for Formula One outfit Marussia last July, was found dead in a Spanish hotel room, in Seville, last week. She was travelling at between 30 and 40mph when she hit a support truck during a straight-line. De Villota had appeared to make a remarkable recovery from the injuries she sustained in the life-threatening crash ahead of last year's British Grand Prix. Ana Botellla, the current mayor of Madrid (pictured centre) was among mourners at the service .

David Cameron today hailed a ‘great victory for common sense’ as two convicted murderers lost a Supreme Court battle for the right to vote while in jail. The UK's highest court dismissed appeals brought by Peter Chester and George McGeoch. Judges said the public is opposed to giving inmates the vote and it was ‘not surprising’ MPs had moved to block the idea. Defeat: Murderers George McGeoch (left) and Peter Chester lost their Supreme Court bid to demand they be given the right to vote behind bars . The latest round of the legal battle against the ban preventing them from voting while in prison was rejected by seven Supreme Court justices in London. Chester, who is in his 50s, is serving life for raping and strangling his seven-year-old niece Donna Marie Gillbanks in Blackpool in 1977. McGeoch, from Glasgow, is serving his life sentence at Dumfries prison for the 1998 murder of Eric Innes in Inverness. Mr Cameron, who once said the idea of giving prisoners the vote makes him ‘sick’, wrote on Twitter this morning: ‘The Supreme Court judgment on prisoner voting is a great victory for common sense.’ In the unanimous ruling, Lady Hale, Deputy President of the Supreme Court, said: ‘Prisoners' voting is an emotive subject. 'Some people feel very strongly that prisoners should not be allowed to vote. And public opinion polls indicate that most people share that view.’ There is still a ‘substantial majority against it’, she said, adding: ‘It is not surprising therefore that in February 2011 elected Parliamentarians also voted overwhelmingly against any relaxation of the present law.’ Backing: David Cameron expressed his delight at the ruling, having previously said the idea of giving prisoners the vote makes him 'sick' Lady Hale said: ‘In such circumstances, it is incumbent upon the courts to tread delicately. ‘Of course, in any modern democracy, the views of the public and Parliamentarians cannot be the end of the story. ‘Democracy is about more than respecting the views of the majority. It is also about safeguarding the rights of minorities, including unpopular minorities.’ The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2005 that a blanket ban on serving prisoners going to the polls was incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), relating to the right to free and fair elections. The European court said it was up to individual countries to decide which inmates should be denied the right to vote from jail, but that a total ban was illegal. Ruling: Lady Hale, one of the Supreme Court judges, said it was not surprising that MPs had voted against the idea . Chester, who is also known as Peter Chester Speakman, originally had his voting claims rejected by the High Court in 2009. His challenge at the Supreme Court followed a decision by three Court of Appeal judges in December 2010 when it was argued on his behalf that the serious nature of his offence did not justify disenfranchising him, and to do so was ‘disproportionate’ and violated his human rights. Another Supreme Court judge Lord Sumption said today: ‘In any democracy, the franchise will be determined by domestic laws which will define those entitled to vote in more or less inclusive terms.’ ‘The exclusion of convicted prisoners from the franchise is not a universal principle among mature democracies, but neither is it uncommon.’ Lord Sumption added: ‘From a prisoner's point of view the loss of the right to vote is likely to be a very minor deprivation by comparison with the loss of liberty.’ Chester is detained at Wakefield prison in West Yorkshire and the minimum term he was ordered to serve before becoming eligible to apply for parole has expired. McGeoch received a minimum term of 13 years, but due to subsequent convictions, including taking two prison nurses hostage in a siege in 2001, will not be considered for parole until 2015. Under section three of the Representation of the People Act 1983, convicted prisoners are prevented from voting in parliamentary and local government elections - and under the European Parliamentary Elections Act 2002 a person is only entitled to vote in European parliamentary elections if he is entitled to vote in parliamentary elections. In November the Government published the Voting Eligibility (Prisoners) Draft Bill for pre-legislative scrutiny by a joint committee of both Houses. It has put forward three options - a ban for prisoners sentenced to four years or more, a ban for prisoners sentenced to more than six months and a re-statement of the existing ban. Sadiq Khan, Labour’s shadow justice secretary, said: 'Labour’s policy is, and always has been, that prisoners shouldn’t be given the vote. 'We believe that committing a crime so serious that a judge has deprived you of your liberty means you should also lose the ability to vote in elections. That's why we are pleased with today's Supreme Court judgement.'","Murderers Peter Chester and George McGeoch lose latest legal battle .

French politicians have been accused of trying to ‘offload’ Syrian refugees on Britain in a growing row over who should give them asylum. Scores of Syrians have occupied the Calais ferry terminal including a dozen who are on hunger strike and two threatening to kill themselves if they are not given safe passage to Britain. But a French MEP has come under fire after urging the European Parliament to back their call to be allowed into Britain. Scroll down for video . Hunger strike: Some of the Syrians occupying a footbridge at the Calais ferry terminal . Unlike Britain, France does not pay benefits to asylum seekers while their claims are being processed. About 40 Syrians have refused to move from a passenger gangway. Ahead of a debate in Brussels, French MEP Hélène Flautre wrote to all MEPs with a message from the refugees in which they complain they are sleeping outside 'just because we have chosen to go and live in England'. She said: ‘Considering the debate we have today on the EU's response to the flow of refugees as a result of the conflict in Syria, I would like to convey the call from Syrians who are now in Calais (France) and want to reach Britain to apply for asylum.’ But British politicians are outraged at the suggestion that France should not take responsibility for people in their own country while viewing the UK as a ‘soft touch’. UKIP MEP Gerard Batten wrote back to Miss Flautre: 'Since they are already in France why don't you propose that France offers them asylum?' About 60 Syrian refugees, of whom 40 are on a hunger strike, have occupied a key point in the northern French port . Stand off: French CRS riot police stand guard as Syrian asylum seekers occupy the ferry terminal in Calais . 'First of all, we are very thankful to what have already been done for the Syrian people who suffer from disastrous killing. 'Children, women, men and even animals and plants are being killed or destroyed. So, we feel that there are some sides which are being fed on the Syrian blood because till now no one can stop this terrible war. 'Firstly, we want to draw your kind attention to the bad situation that the Syrians are facing in some parts of Europe especially in France and Italy. 'For example, in Calais, France, we are sleeping outside and have no food or shelter to protect us from the winter cold just because we have chosen to go and live in England. In other hand, in Italy the police take our prints by force to prevent us to go anywhere else. 'Secondly, we hope all European countries to do what Sweden has done to save the Syrian people. We also hope to make the asylum procedure faster to reunion and stop the pain. 'The Syrians in Calais are insisting to go to England which we want to show that it stands and support the Syrian people and it should try to find a way to take us from Calais, France. 'Finally, we need immediate action in order to save humanity and peace in Syria. 'We also beg you to do it fast because our families are living in a bad situation and we need to go to England as fast as possible to work and send them money.' Mr Batten, the UK Independence Party’s spokesman on security and defence, said later: ‘The suggestion that Syrian refugees in Calais should be sent post-haste to England is absolutely outrageous. ‘These people have made their way across Europe with the intention of landing up in the UK. This is contrary to the UN Convention on Refugees that says they should seek refuge in the first safe country they come to. ‘They want to come to Britain because of our reputation as a soft touch. They may indeed be refugees, but they are attracted to Britain because of the generous housing, benefits, and social services systems made available to foreigners. ‘If they French have not prevented their entry into France, as they were entitled to do under the Convention, then the French should offer them asylum, not try to offload the problem onto the UK.’ When French riot police tried to . clear the refugees at the weekend, two men climbed on to the roof of the ferry ticket . hall and threatened to jump. Others erected placards reading: ‘We want to start a new life in England’ and ‘We want to talk to David Cameron’. Many said Britain was a ‘better’ place to settle, despite Syria’s close historical links with France. In the message circulated to MEPs, in broken in English, the Syria's describe themselves as being 'stucked in France'. They add: 'We want to draw your kind attention to the bad situation that the Syrians are facing in some parts of Europe especially in France and Italy. 'For example, in Calais, France, we are sleeping outside and have no food or shelter to protect us from the winter cold just because we have chosen to go and live in England.

"By . Jill Reilly . PUBLISHED: . 05:30 EST, 16 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:07 EST, 16 October 2013 . Legacy: Richard Greener was Harvard University's first African-American . A house clearance worker who discovered the papers of Harvard’s first African-American graduate is threatening to burn them unless the university or a collector buys them from him for the 'right price'. Rufus McDonald, 52, found the papers belonging to Richard T. Greener while clearing out a house in Englewood, Chicago, earlier this year. His discovery was hailed as remarkable, as it was feared the records had been destroyed by racist groups or lost in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The papers include Mr Greener's 1870 Harvard diploma and his law license as well as photos and papers connected to his diplomatic role in Russia and his friendship with President Ulysses S. Grant. Mr McDonald sold just two of the documents for $52,000 to the University of South Carolina, where Mr Greener also studied and taught. But he was so incensed by Harvard's offer that he is now threatening to destroy the 140-year-old papers. 'I’ll roast and burn them,' said Mr McDonald who claims Harvard offered him an 'insulting' $7,500 for the collection that was appraised at $65,000. 'It might sound crazy, but people who know me know I’d really do it — I’m sick and tired,' he told the Chicago Sun Times. A Harvard spokesman declined to comment on the ultimatum, but a university source familiar with the negotiation told the newspaper it offered Mr McDonald 'significantly more' than $7,500. According to a bio from the University of South Carolina, where he served as the first African-American professor, Mr Greener was born on January 30, 1844, in Philadelphia and was raised from the age of ten in Boston. Historical: A diploma earned by Richard Theodore Greener is seen at the University of South Carolina . Pay out: Mr McDonald sold two of the documents for $52,000 to the University of South Carolina, where Mr Greener also studied and taught . He attended the Broadway Grammar School in Cambridge, Massachusetts until he was fourteen, then dropped out of school to help support his family, working as a porter, clerk and night-watchman in an assortment of jobs. With help from two of his employers Mr Greener attended school and they arranged for his admission to Harvard in 1865 as an experiment in the education of African-Americans. In 1870 Mr Greener graduated from Harvard with honors, the first African-American to do so. But Mr Greener was not the first black person to be admitted - that title belongs Beverly Garnett Williams, who died just before the academic year began in 1847. Prestige: In 1870 Greener graduated from Harvard with honors . After his graduation Mr Greener spent a few years teaching in schools before becoming a professor at the University of South Carolina in October of 1873. In the years that followed he took a post as a professor in the Howard Law School and married in 1874, having six children with his wife Genevieve Ida Fleet. One of his daughters Belle went on to become a famous librarian to J. P. Morgan in New York. Her skin was light - both Mr Greener and his wife had mixed heritages - so she pretended she was from a white background and added 'da Costa' to her name to give the impression of Portuguese ancestry, as well as changing Greener to Greene. Mr Greener separated from his wife and left the country in 1898 to assume a consular post in Vladivostok, Russia, until 1905. He left the foreign service in 1905, settling in Chicago with relatives, and held a job as an agent for an insurance company and practiced law. Mr Greener occasionally lectured until he died of old age in Chicago on May 2, 1922. The Chicago Sun reports that it is still unclear how the papers ended up in the house that was being cleared to be demolished as Mr Greener did not live near there.","Rufus McDonald, 52, found the papers when clearing an Englewood home .

A man who was part of a mob of masked youths who murdered an innocent painter and decorator has been told he faces a life sentence for the killing. Allan Kalema, 20, was one of up to 20 'Busy Block' gang members who attacked Andrew Jaipaul, 21, who was described as being 'in the wrong place at the wrong time' when he was killed. Mr Jaipaul, an aspiring fashion designer, was chased into a children’s play area and knifed 25 times in the head, chest and legs, despite not having any gang connections. Murdered: Innocent Andrew Jailpaul, 21, left, was killed by a gang of masked youths armed with bats, clubs and knives. Allan Kalema, 20, right, has been convicted of murdering the painter and decorator . At . the time of the attack, Mr Jaipaul's attackers, from Archway, . north London, were trying to get revenge on rivals in the ‘Wray Kray’ and ‘Crouch Hall’ gangs from neighbouring Holloway. They . were caught on CCTV heading towards the scene of the killing in Corker . Walk, Holloway, with their faces disguised by masks and scarves. The . Busy Block had vowed revenge after one of their members, Michael Munza, . was stabbed in the buttocks by members of the rival gangs. Although there was no forensic evidence . linking anyone to the fatal attack, detectives identified members of the . gang by scouring hundreds of hours of CCTV footage and matching it with . eyewitness evidence. On Tuesday Kalema was convicted at the Old Bailey of murdering Mr Jaipaul in the savage attack on June 26, 2011. He is facing a possible life sentence at a court hearing on Friday. Kalema . was the sixth person to be convicted of the killing, joining Tirrell . Ball-Thomas, 20, Tommy McInerny, 21, Jojo Mafwa, 20, and two teenagers . aged 15 and 18, who all are currently serving life sentences. Convicted: Tony Walker, 20, was cleared of the murder but found guilty of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm while Jamie Farrell, 21, was convicted of violent disorder . Another member of the gang, Tony Walker, 20, was cleared of murder after standing trial alongside Kalema, but found guilty of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm. Three other young men, Jamie Farrell, 21, Elliot Parkinson, 18, and Tylon Mason-Riley, 20, were convicted of violent disorder in connection with the attack. Two trials heard how residents in Holloway, north London, witnessed a stampede of youths entering the notorious Andover Estate. They reported that the gang were armed with weapons including pieces of wood, a baseball bat and a metal pole. Mr Jaipaul was walking through the estate to his home in Birnam Road at around 10pm when he was confronted. The gang could be heard cheering and chanting Busy Block as they fled after the attack. Facing prison: Tylon Mason-Riley, 20, left, and 18-year-old Elliot Parkinson, right, were convicted of violent disorder in connection with the killing . A witness from one home in Coker Walk said that after the killing she had heard a noise she described as being like ‘cheers from a stadium.’ Another heard the conversation of one of the gang on his mobile phone, as the youth boasted: ‘He has just been juked up boy. He ain’t going to make it.’ One teenager was heard to ask: ‘Did you see the guy get stabbed? Is he dead?’ Kalema and Walker, both of Upper Holloway, had denied murder and conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm and violent disorder. They were due to be sentenced on Friday, along with Farrell, of Islington, Parkinson, of Tottenham and Mason-Riley, from Holloway. In a victim impact statement, Mr Jaipaul’s mother Joanna described Andrew as ‘a loving and loved son, a brother, a loyal friend to many.' She added: ‘It is very difficult to put into words the enormous loss and grief that the family feel. That grief is totally overwhelming. ‘As a family we know that we have to move on with our lives and that will always be difficult when such an important part of our lives will be forever missing.’ Tragically his father Godwin died before the case came to court and did not see his son's killers brought to justice.

There are very few things more annoying than tucking into your breakfast only for an uninvited guest to turn up halfway through. And this fierce lion certainly made clear his irritation at an unwanted diner intruding on his pride's feast. When a younger male was audacious enough to swim across a Zambian lake to try and muscle in on a rival pride's buffalo kill, his older rival wasn't willing to give up a mouthful of food and lashed out to protect it. The stunning set of pictures was taken by wildlife photographer and safari tour guide Edward Selfe. Hands off! A young lion is attacked by a member of a separate pride after attempting to muscle in on dinner . Hungry: A young male lion tentatively approaches a rival pack with half an eye on the buffalo they are eating . Brave: The young lion lies down and waits in the territory of the other pride while its rival lions look on . Ready to pounce: The younger lion calmly allows his larger rival to stalk up behind him as he lies waiting . The member of the feasting pack attacked his younger rival as he brazenly sat by the side of the lake in rival territory. Despite his initial bravery - he was outnumbered by the males in the rival pack - the lion was sent packing with his tail between his legs and still hungry. Mr Selfe, originally from south . Dorset, managed to capture the altercation between the two lions when he . took an early morning trip out to Zambia's South Luangwa's National . Park hoping to spot the pride eating breakfast. Edward . said: 'Picking up the sight of vultures dropping onto the ground in the . distance, we headed towards them, hoping that perhaps the resident . Mwamba Pride had killed something the night before. 'Indeed . they had - we quickly found all 19 of the pride feeding on a fresh . buffalo carcass which they'd killed just an hour earlier. 'The pride are well known for preying on buffalo and they have many battle scars to show for it. 'Suddenly, . while most were feeding, several of the pride stood up and stared . intently across the river. We followed their gaze with binoculars and . couldn't see anything initially, but eventually resolved two male lions . from a neighbouring pride walking along the top of the opposite river . bank. Ferocious: The two lions trade blows as the bigger of the two attacks . What a shot: The stunning selection of images was taken by wildlife photographer and safari tour guide Edward Selfe, originally from South Dorset . Pot luck: Edward had taken an early morning trip out to Zambia's South Luangwa's National Park hoping to spot the pride eating breakfast . Age over youthful exuberance: The male from the larger pride eventually comes out on top and chases the other young male away . He added: 'They appeared interested in the buffalo kill and the females feeding on it. 'But . they looked young and we assumed that they were aware of how unevenly . matched they would be if they challenged the males with the large pride. 'Some . of the pride began to call to affirm territorial claim and the young . males on the opposite bank lay down, apparently thinking again about . approaching. The pride on our side continued to feed. 'Soon . enough though, one of the young males began to move again and descended . the river bank and waded across the river towards us. 'This . drew considerable attention from the whole pride who stopped feeding . and watched his approach carefully. At this point, the intruder was . still 400m from the buffalo carcass. Making his escape: The smaller lion makes a hasty retreat after being taught a lesson by his fierce older rival . Tour guide: The picture was taken by seasoned wildlife photographer Edward Selfe, pictured . 'After reaching dry land, the youngster pranced along the bank, feigning indifference at the 19 pairs of eyes glowering at him.' Mr Selfe and the group of tourists were only about 20 metres away from the feasting pack when one lion broke away and confronted the unwelcome dinner guest. 'One of the pride males started to walk towards him, but approaching from behind, apparently stalking the younger lion. 'Of course, the youngster was more than aware of his presence but chose to lie still. Barely believing what we were seeing, the young male allowed the larger pride male to stalk right up to him, reacting only when the attacker was almost on top of him. 'It was all over in about 10 seconds, but the photos show that it was not merely a ritual - the youngster was rolled on his back and the older male picked up some cuts on his face.'","This stunning set of pictures was taken by wildlife photographer and safari tour guide Edward Selfe .

He met the two-year-old for the first time when Ty was in hospital being treated for injuries allegedly caused by Joseph Patterson.

Grinning in a 'selfie' with a blazing Iraqi oilfield behind him, this is how Tony Blair is being portrayed in a new exhibition about modern warfare. The Imperial War Museum North in Manchester says Catalyst: Contemporary Art and War, a collection of 70 works created since since the First Gulf War, forms the largest and most important show of its kind for years. At its centre is the kennardphillipps' take on the decision to invade Iraq ten years ago, with a happy Tony Blair cut in front of a shocking battle scene of smoke and flames in Iraq. Powerful: Kennardphillipps' take on the decision to invade Iraq ten years ago shows a happy Tony Blair in front of burning oil field . The exhibition also includes Turner Prize winning artist Steve McQueen's For Queen and Country. It is a series of 'postage . stamp' sheets with photographic portraits of those who died in . the Iraq War and each one also bears the standard profile of the Queen. The work was completed in collaboration with 98 families of the . deceased soldiers who chose the photographs.

Empty: Langlands and Bell's House of Osama bin Laden, is an interactive vido reflecting the long hunt for the terrorist . Lonely: Paul Seawright's photographs of minefields in Afghanistan show a seemingly empty landscape, which in reality is both lethal and inaccessible . The exhibition showcases installations, photography, film,sculpture, oil paintings, prints and book works; varying from the highly moving to the humorous,philosophical or outrageous. It explores how art ifluences perceptions of conflict and shapes the way history is written. Rasheed Araeen’s White Stallion explores the role of the media by questioning the nature of propaganda during the First Gulf War, while Paul Seawright seeks an alternative way of photographing war through his images of empty, but lethal minefields in Afghanistan. Artists are often driven by their own experiences, political views or a desire to protest. Taysir Batniji’s series of estate agent details for destroyed homes in Gaza is a tongue-in-cheek comment on the situation in Palestine.

Some artists aim to counter common opinions, while others explore the legacy of their own family history, or the long-term impact of conflict.

Christian Louboutin has won a court ruling against an anti-Islam group who 'tarnished' the footwear brand's image by featuring his iconic red-soled shoes in an advert . The poster in question showed the Louboutin-clad legs of Anke Van dermeersch, a former Miss Belgium winner and now a senator for far-right group Vlaams Belang (Flemish Interest). An accompanying key showed what it claimed was Islam's view of a woman based on the length of her skirt, from 'sharia conform' at floor level to 'stoning' at the top of the thigh. The poster in question showed the Louboutin-clad legs of Anke Van dermeersch, a senator for far-right group Vlaams Belang .

Twenty-nine children have been taken to hospital in Russia after medics accidentally injected them 2,500 times the recommended dose of tuberculosis during a screening test. Eleven pupils were flown thousands of miles to Moscow from their school in the remote region of Primorsky for specialist treatment after complaining of 'severe allergic reactions' and headaches. Another 18 are being treated in hospital locally. 'Severe allergic reactions': Nearly 30 Russian children have been taken to hospital after blundering medics gave them 2,500 times the recommended dose of TB during a screening test (file picture) Experts are not clear what the prognosis is for such an overdose as it is not believed to have occurred before. However, they deny the children are at risk of contracting TB, it was reported by The Siberian Times. Governor Valdimir Miklysheviskiy has fired the director of the regional health department, Oleg Bubnov, over the error which was caused when a doctor and nurse broke rules over how the test should be administered. Delicate procedure: The test for TB involves injecting a small amount of an extract of the tuberculosis bacteria, called tuberculin, into the skin (file picture) The Mantoux test is a widely used screening method for latent and active tuberculosis, a potentially fatal airborne bacterial infection, above, that attacks the lungs. The test involves injecting a substance called tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) into the skin of the forearm. In the UK, the standard dose includes two tuberculin units in 0.1ml of solution. Within 48 to 72 hours, those with a latent infection will develop a hard red bump at the site of the injection. If you have a very strong reaction, it may indicate you have active TB. The test is named after Charles Mantoux, a French physician who created his test in 1907. Mr Miklysheviskiy said: 'The health department's work must be considered unsatisfactory. The situation in Yakovlevskiy district is a failure by the health department.' The error occurred during a widely used screening method for tuberculosis, known as the Mantoux test, on children aged 11-16 in Novosysoyevka village, Yakovlevskiy district. The Mantoux test involves mixing a small dose of an extract of the tuberculosis bacteria, called tuberculin, into a solution ready for injection. But Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova said the medical staff instead chose to dissolve the tuberculin in a powder, a method that should only be carried in hospital conditions. Mrs Skvortsova said: 'They made a mistake - a technical error - using a dose bigger than it should have been. 'Two children have a severe toxic and allergic reaction to the wrongly made Mantoux test. It has nothing to do with tuberculosis.' The eleven children being treated in Moscow are expected to remain under observation for three weeks. Three years ago, a newborn baby fell seriously ill after being given an overdose of the TB vaccine. The boy was injected with 0.5mg of the BCG vaccine - 10 times the usual 0.05mg dose, lawyers for his family said at the time. A statement from law firm Irwin Mitchell said the boy was treated for TB with help from the poisons agency and an expert in immunology at Sheffield Children's Hospital.","Pupils suffered severe toxic reactions and headaches at Siberian school .

Does your dog do a bunk every time you let him off the lead? According to pet astrologer Fiona Celeste, from Glasgow, it's not because they don't like you - it's because their wandering ways are written in the stars. Celeste, the UK’s only professional astrologer for cats and dogs, says it is understandable that owners become upset when beloved pets disappear, but argues it is a case of nature over nurture. Well-starred: Astrologer Fiona Celeste (with her Maltese dog Pippa) says star signs say a lot about character . Important: Fiona says that astrology can help you to better understand the family pets . The 55-year-old mystic and mother of three, said: 'It can be in an animal’s nature to explore. The position of the planets when a pet was born really influences their characteristics. 'Some are always going to be very adventurous, others are naturally incredibly homely. For example, Aries pets are very impulsive and like to assert their control. 'It’s especially important to keep these dogs on a lead to guard against their nature, and stop them making a run for it.' Pet owners who haven't quite managed to pull of the trick include Strictly Come Dancing star Abbey Crouch who was devastated when her long-haired tabby cat, Maggie, went missing from her London home last August. Luckily for Crouch, she and her pet were reunited a week later, after the 27-year-old launched an appeal on Twitter. Other celebrities have also taken to Twitter with appeals to find their missing pets, including Emma Bunton whose chocolate Labrador Phoebe ran off during a walk in February. 'Gemini pets are incredibly fast moving and love meeting other people and animals, so could also be quite prone to zipping off down the street for a while,' adds Celeste. 'By contrast, Taurean pets are usually much slower and have a very placid nature so don’t tend to go missing so much. 'If your pet is a Cancer, they’ll be a homebird too. They like to have their home comforts nearby. You can really unlock a lot about your dog or cat’s personality by looking to the skies when they were born.'If your pet does make a bid for freedom, . Celeste says that making the most of astrological know-how can help to . bring them home. Twitter: Abbey Clancy and Emma Bunton both used social media to ask people to help them find their lost pets . Insight: According to Fiona, astrology can help shed light on your pet's character - and stop it from wandering . 'Most pets are likely to find their own way home sooner or later, but there can be things you can do to help,' she explains. 'For example, you should never scold a . Leo pet. They have big egos and it would break their heart. So if . you’re out hunting for a missing Leo make sure you don’t sound too . cross. 'Geminis are known for being very vocal. So if a Gemini has gone off on an adventure keep an ear out to track them down. 'And . with an Aries, it’s especially important to show them who’s boss. Take . them to puppy training classes to make sure they know your commands if . they do ever try to disappear on an adventure.' She added: 'When I see missing pet . posters in the street I often wonder what sign the animal is. Fortunately Pippa, my Maltese Terrier, has never made a run for it.' Celeste . says her keen interest in the zodiac is the legacy of her mother, . Alice, who would regularly remark on how people’s personalities were . influenced by their star sign. 'She . would even do the same for our pets,' remembers Celeste. 'Our lovely . little Yorkie Heather was, in my mum’s words, a typical Sagittarius. Clients: Most of Fiona's work involves cats like Coco Styles (pictured) whose horoscope can be found below . Fiona says: 'Coco's an explorer. She loves playing and chasing, and she's very curious. It's probably a good idea to keep her stocked up with toys to keep her entertained. 'As an Aries, Coco needs to feel as if she's number one at at all times. She likes being in charge, which allows her to act on impulse. She's likely to behave mischievously if she doesn't get her way. 'She's definitely a loveable rogue and extremely active. She's intrepid, and likes to experience new things. She's usually the first to initiate play. 'The name Coco suits her personality. She's a born entertainer and loves to see people smiling. 'It's likely that she'll want to satisfy her curiosity with the occasional adventure. She's the daredevil of cats at heart. 'She has the moon, the sun and the Venus of Aries. She needs adventure for her emotional, spiritual and physical wellbeing. 'Her Mars is in Sagittarius which, like Aries, is also a fire sign. This suggests she has a fiery personality and prone to act on impulse.' Owner's verdict: 'I'm impressed that Fiona has got so much spot on, particularly her love of people and her liking for getting out and about. 'She is an old cat though, so she's doing it a lot less than she used to and is confining her adventures to the house!' 'Heather had bags of confidence and loved her freedom, and I grew up believing my mum really did have a point.' But it was only after giving up her career as an air stewardess to have her children Chris, 18, Jen, 17, and Bob, 14, that Celeste found the time to truly indulge her passion. Initially she focused on reading horoscopes for family and friends, but always knew there was a gap in the market to help people to get to know their pets. 'At first I dismissed the idea, thinking it was far too crazy,' explains Celeste. 'But after my mother died in 2007 I started taking the idea more seriously. Life seemed too short not to give new things a try. 'So in 2008 I set up my Celestial Paws business, and started accepting clients for readings in 2009. Now I’ve produced horoscopes for well over 100 pets. 'It gives me a great sense of satisfaction to bring people even closer with their animals. Knowing your pet’s star sign can also be an invaluable aid when starting behaviour training too.' Owners send Celeste a description or photograph of their prized pet and its birth details, and for £30 will receive a 7,000 word detailed reading based on the position of the sun when the animal was born. Although the bulk of her business is for dogs and cats, Celeste will happily produce horoscopes for any species, whether horse, cow or reptile. She said: 'It is mostly cats and dogs, as the owners need to have the precise date their pet was born. That tends to be missing with other animals.' But she admits not everyone is convinced, especially her husband David, 50. 'Although he is really supportive, David still chalks a lot of horoscopes as down to coincidence,' reveals Celeste. 'I can’t persuade him. I think my kids find it embarrassing too. It’s a bit quirky I suppose.' Fiona has also written a dog owner’s guide to animal star signs - Sun Signs for K9S - with a proportion of profits donated to the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.","Fiona Celeste, 55, is the UK's only professional pet astrologer .

Last year, the Warwick University ladies rowing team made headlines when their nude charity calendar became the target of criticism from feminist bloggers. But despite the blogger's best efforts, the fundraiser proved a success and resulted in more than £600 being donated to Macmillan Cancer Support. Now, the Warwick girls are back with a new calendar and say they won't be told when and where to show off their bodies by feminists. Unabashed: Hettie (centre) and her fellow rowers haven't been put off by the backlash as these images reveal . 'In our opinion, the feminists who . criticised our calendar for hampering the feminist cause are . contradicting their own argument.,' explained students Hettie Reed, Frankie Salzano and Sophie Bell - all of whom appear in the new calendar. 'Surely what feminists are seeking to . achieve is equality for men and women - be it in jobs, pay, opportunities or the impression that society has of them. 'As the men of our club have produced a . successful [naked] calendar for the past four years, we are more than entitled to . do the same thing.' They added: 'As politics students all three of us . would consider ourselves feminists, any woman who wants equality would, . but we don't think that we are hampering the cause - in fact we think we . are furthering it.' In a blog post for the Huffington Post, Layla Haidrani, who describes herself as a commentator on feminist issues, described the initiative as 'tacky' and insisted that the girls were 'victims in the liberation game'. Charity: Like the 2013 effort, proceeds from this year's calendar will go to support Macmillan Cancer Support . Backlash: Last year's calendar caused controversy after it was criticised by feminist blogger Layla Haidrani . 'Groups of women posing semi-naked on a field with sticks doesn't . sound a fundraising initiative for charity, it just sounds tacky,' she wrote. 'Although many argue that it is purely . for fundraising purposes, in my own university sports team, the majority . of women who participated were not made aware and did not even seek to . find out which charities were being helped. 'Rather, . they just view it as an opportunity to strip and attempt to gain . notoriety with friends and family both back home and on campus. 'As . opposed to being liberated by posing semi-naked, they are in fact just . helping women to be perpetually viewed as sex objects, something to be ""bought"", ""sold"" and then tossed away once the Christmas period is over.' But the Warwick rowers, far from being put off by the backlash, insist that Haidrani was wrong to criticise them and say they received overwhelming support from the general public. 'The controversy last year was a shame . considering it was all intended for a good cause,' explains Hettie. 'Ultimately, we . received an overwhelming amount of support with many people sending in . emails thanking us for supporting such a great charity and sharing . stories with us about how Macmillan Cancer Support had benefited them.' Support: The girls raised more than £600 for their chosen charity last year and received many kind messages . High hopes: The girls hope this year's effort will raise more money and that interest will focus on the cause . Like last year's effort, the 2014 . calendar comes in tasteful black and white and features the girls posing . in a variety of rowing-related scenes, including wandering out of the . boat shed and standing next to a wooden pier with life jackets to cover . their modesty.

Jailed: Ex-policeman Jon Webb has been sentenced to six years in prison for forgery and theft . A policeman stole £23,000 from a 94-year-old widow and forged her will in an attempt to inherit the bulk of her £400,000 estate. PC Jonathan Webb was described by colleagues as an ‘utter disgrace to the uniform’ after he was jailed for six years yesterday. The . South Yorkshire Police officer admitted preying on a trusting . pensioner, whom he befriended after he was called to her home when she . had a fall. He volunteered to visit her in hospital afterwards, and when she had recovered he gained access to her bank accounts. He . set up internet banking and applied for a cash card so he could . withdraw money at will, often taking £300 a day. He even closed down a . pension account so he could access her life savings, Leeds Crown Court . heard. He also typed a . false will on his  victim’s typewriter, using details from her old will . to craft a new document making himself the main beneficiary. Webb, . who has five children from three marriages, was exposed after he came . under suspicion for another offence, in which he stole £1,000 and 500 US . dollars recovered after a burglary. Officers . investigating the case found the pensioner’s faked will in the boot of . his car, and a box of Second World War medals in his locker – the . product of another theft. Webb, . 45, of Millhouses, Sheffield, resigned in May after 20 years in the . force. He admitted five charges of theft, five of fraud and one of . forgery. Fraudster: Webb took advantage of a 94-year-old woman to steal money from her and alter her will .

Guy Kearl QC said: ‘You have brought disgrace upon yourself and upon the . police service for whom you served many years and you have undermined . the public  confidence in our police service. ‘I . am satisfied once you had seen her [the victim] you had selected her as . your prey and then you committed sophisticated and planned acts of . fraud and theft on a frail and confused elderly lady.’ Alisha Kaye, prosecuting, told the court Webb had visited the pensioner on more than 30 occasions. The . victim was ‘independent’ and had ‘worked very hard for everything she . owns’, the court heard. She has no surviving relatives. Miss . Kaye said: ‘She does not fully understand why the defendant has done . this to her. It is very hard for her now to trust anyone. ‘The . defendant preyed upon her vulnerability, she trusted him as a friend. She trusted the defendant because he was a policeman and said it is his . job to look after people like her.’ Webb’s . barrister Sam Green said the former officer realised his behaviour was . ‘disgraceful and despicable’, and wished to ‘apologise unreservedly’.","Jon Webb, 45, met 94-year-old victim when she needed help after a fall .

A husband has relived the horrifying . moments he battled to save his wife as she drowned in 'hellish' waters . while swimming in the Canary Islands. Nicola Bate, 48, was dragged out to . sea after she went for a swim off Famara Beach, near the resort of . Caleta de Famara in Lanzarote. On hearing her screams, Anthony Bate, . 56, left his children at a beach bar, and dashed out into the sea in a . desperate attempt to rescue her. He grabbed hold of her, but started to struggle in the strong riptide. As he fought for his life he was rescued by a lifeguard and pulled to shore, only to discover his wife had died. Tragic: Nikki Bate, pictured with her husband Anthony, drowned while on holiday at Famara beach, in Lanzarote. Anthony tried to save her but the current pulled them apart . An inquest in Clitheroe, Lancashire, was . told the tragedy occurred last month after the Bates and their three . children - India, 14, Nathaniel, 12, and Cameron, 10 - arrived at their . holiday home on the island. During the brief five minute hearing, . Mr Bate of Barrow, Lancs said that the family arrived at the beach at . about one o’clock and had lunch at a bar. 'The beach was packed but there was nobody in the sea. I didn’t see my wife enter the water.' 'When I looked around and saw her I turned to my daughter India and said “what is your mum doing out there?”' An inquest heard that Mr Bate also fought for his life in the sea, but was rescued by a lifeguard and pulled to the shore. There, he discovered his wife had died. The company director said he got into the water and reached his wife very quickly, but the conditions were 'hellish'. 'The sea was terrible. It was shocking. I’ve never seen anything like it.' He said he managed to get his wife onto his back but they weren’t going anywhere. 'I remember thinking there are going to be three children seeing two bodies being brought out of the water.' The lifeguard arrived and Mr Bate and his wife were pulled to the shore. 'I thought because she was only under water for such a short amount of time she would be ok.' He said the lifeguards had tried tirelessly to revive his wife, but about 15 minutes later a policeman told him she had died. 'I asked if we could say goodbye and I asked them to cover her.' He said he still cannot understand why she went in the water. 'We had been to the beach before. The . red flags fly all the time. It is a very dangerous beach. I cannot . imagine why she went for a swim.' It had been earlier reported that the . tragedy occurred after Mrs Bate had warned her two sons that the water . was too dangerous after they wanted to go body-boarding. Mrs Bate drowned in big seas off Famara breach, near Caleta de Famara, Lanzarote, pictured, where the family have a holiday home . Coroner Michael Singleton recorded a . verdict of accidental death: 'Nicola Bate was overcome by water despite . desperate attempts to save her.' Mr Bate declined to comment after the hearing. Nicola, who is originally from the village of Whalley in Lancashire was a housewife who also volunteered for the Home-Start charity. The couple had met 20 years ago at an Asda store in Accrington and bonded over their mutual vegetarianism. It had been reported earlier that the . tragedy occurred after Mrs Bate herself warned her two sons that the . water was too dangerous after they wanted to go body-boarding. 'It was a little mistake with . calamitous consequences and this is the tragedy we’re left with,' said . Mr Bate. 'We are all devastated but we are being strong.' Lanzarote, the easternmost of the Canary Islands, is one of the most popular destinations in Europe for British tourists. Another British national died on the same beach in April after being pulled unconscious from the sea by fellow bathers. The beach, on the island’s north coast, has become increasingly popular . with surfers from around the world in recent years, according to local . tourism websites.","Nicola Bate was dragged out to sea after she went for a swim at Famara Beach, Lanzarote .

Moose populations are declining rapidly and could disappear from some states in North America. But while scientists have noticed the steep drop in numbers in Minnesota, New Hampshire, Montana and British Columbia, the reason for the animal's plight remains a mystery. Scientists' theories range from brainworms infecting animals to ticks sucking their blood that could be depleting populations but it seems that global warming could be a common theme. Biologist Nicholas DeCesare, of the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, who counts moose in the state, told The New York Times 'there's fewer moose out there, and hunters are working harder to find them' Minnesota had two separate moose populations just 20 years ago but one of them has all but vanished, while the other is falling from 25 per cent a year to around 3,000 animals, despite hunting permits almost halving since 1995. Biologist Nicholas DeCesare, of the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, who counts moose in the state, told The New York Times 'there's fewer moose out there, and hunters are working harder to find them'. One theory is that climate change is damaging moose populations. Winters are shorter and Autumns milder in New Hampshire, leading to the animals suffering from more parasitic ticks. Moose living in Minnesota have been found to have brain worms and liver flukes - parasitic flatworms that feed on blood and are located in the liver that spend most of their lives in snails that live in moist areas. Global warming could also be affecting moose as the creatures, which are built for cold weather, can expend extra energy staying cool in milder weather, which can make them exhausted and even kill them. Moose living in Minnesota (pictured) have been found to have brain worms and liver flukes. Global warming could also be affecting moose as the creatures, which are built for cold weather, can expend extra energy staying cool in milder weather, which can make them exhausted and even kill them . Another recent study found moose living in mountains in British Columbia have suffered habitat loss as an epidemic of pine beetles have stripped forests bare, leaving the animals exposed to human and animal predators. Experts believe unregulated hunting might also play a role in increasing moose mortality rates. As autumn approaches, which is when most moose die, scientists hope to solve the mystery of why populations have been hit so hard. Erika Butler, a former vet at the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, said: 'It’s complicated because there’s so many pieces of this puzzle that could be impacted by climate change.' Experts said moose deaths are hard to study as they are solitary animals and consequently can be difficult to track. When they die, the animals have so much body fat that their bodies decompose quickly, leaving few clues behind for scientists. Researchers think ticks (pictured) are partially responsible for declining numbers of moose. They lose a lot of blood and become anemic, tearing out their fur so that in springtime, despite broadly warmer temperatures, the animals can die of hypothermia as they are without their warm, waterproof coats . Minnesota began a $1.2million study using cutting-edge technology to find moose as quickly as possible after they die, by fitting live animals with collars that show researchers their location every 15 minutes. If an animal's heart stops beating, the collars send a text message with its coordinates so scientists can recover the body to looks for causes of death. Researchers are relatively sure that ticks are partially responsible for declining numbers of moose. The animals lose a lot of blood and become anemic, tearing out their fur and becoming 'crazy' so that in springtime, despite broadly warmer temperatures, the animals can die of hypothermia as they are without their warm, waterproof coats.","U.S. biologists have noticed the steep drop in moose numbers in Minnesota, New Hampshire, Montana and British Columbia .

A family has sued two social workers and their supervisor for allegedly lying to them about the past sexual abuse of their two adopted sons who went on to repeatedly assault their daughters. Beverly and James Hilger from Shelbyville, Kentucky, said social workers in Jefferson County denied . that the boys, who were 11 and 15 when they were adopted in 2005, had not . been sexually abused and did not have a history of sexually abusing . others. In fact, the boys' files showed the opposite - but workers would not hand . them over to the family. The parents have now filed the lawsuit on behalf of their 17-year-old adopted daughter Ashley, who was nine when she was allegedly first abused by her brothers. One of the brothers, Jose A. Rodriguez, was an adult when the alleged abuse occurred and is now awaiting trial. The other brother, who was a juvenile at the time, has not been charged. Scroll down for video . Fighter: Ashley Hilger, 17, was 9 when she was allegedly first abused by her adoptive brothers. Her family has filed a lawsuit against social workers, claiming they failed to disclose the boys' sexual abuse history . Anger: Her adoptive mother, Beverly Hilger, said she forgives her sons but will never forgive the social workers . The Hilgers' attorney, William McMurray, claims that the department hid the facts from the family in order to find homes for the boys so that it would reach its placement quotas. 'I think they lied because it's all about moving flesh,' he told WDRB. 'It's all about quotas, numbers.' The lawsuit states the social workers, William Hardin and Desiree Rhodes, failed to disclose important information so the parents could make an informed decision about adopting a child. It also says the Cabinet for Health and Family Services failed to properly monitor and train the social workers and also names the cabinet's deputy commissioner, Bonnie Hommrich. Hilger said that the boys' adoption . was finalized in 2005 but it took nearly a year to finally get their . hands on their files - and to discover the truth about the boys' pasts. They were determined to provide the boys a home, but they also sought to protect their other six children, two of whom are biological. Accused: The social workers' supervisor Bonnie Hommrich, left, has been named in the lawsuit. One of the adopted brother, Jose A. Rodriguez, right, faces a trial this month for the alleged sexual abuse . 'We had monitors, we had alarms, we had the let's sit down and talk . about no closed doors to bedrooms,' Beverly told WAVE. 'But you've got . to lay your head down and sleep at night and monsters come out at . night.' Ashley said that the boys acted like brothers in the daytime but at night, they would sexually abuse her. It started when she was nine and continued for years, she said. She said she was initially scared to say anything but in 2007, she finally told her mother about abuse at the hands of the younger brother. 'First of all, I don't think this is . something that I should be ashamed about, I didn't want this to happen, I . didn't choose for this to happen,' she said. Beverly Hilger said that when Ashley came forward, the younger boy admitted to molesting her and threatening her if she told anyone else, the lawsuit said. Let down: The Hilgers said that when they asked if the boys had been abused, workers said no . Close: Ashley and Beverly pictured before Ashley's prom. Beverly and her husband have six adopted children . Another sister also told her that two younger developmentally disabled daughters had been abused by the younger boy. When her mother told the cabinet about . the alleged abuse, they simply said the abuse was child-on-child so . they could do nothing about it, Mrs Hilger said. She said the girls underwent counseling and the boy was placed on a sex offender's program. Then in 2010, Ashley revealed she had also been abused by the older boy, Jose Rodriguez, who was then an adult. He is now facing a criminal trial on October 30 for the alleged abuse. The younger boy - who has not been named as he was a juvenile at the time of the alleged abuse - has apologized and is now living on his own in another state. He was never charged. 'I don't want anything like this to happen to anyone because it's not fair,' Ashley Hilger said. Claims: The suit claims the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, pictured, failed to monitor or train the social workers, but the cabinet said it had not been named in the suit and could not comment . Her mother said she is still the boys' adoptive mother and that it was the state who failed them. 'I do forgive them for what they did but I . will never forgive the social workers because they put these girls and . my boys in harms way,' Hilger said. 'It's important to know . these boys weren't represented properly, either... They weren't placed . in a home that could meet their needs.'

Jennifer Blair, a transgender woman, is suing for the right to have free breast cancer screenings after being turned away by a clinic for not being 'genetically female' Ms Blair, 62, from Colorado, had gender reassignment surgery more than a decade ago and takes a daily dose of synthetic oestrogen . The state-run clinic is funded by the Women's Wellness Connection and offers free cancer screenings for women on low income. But Ms Blair was shocked to be told she could not have the mammogram because she was not born a woman. 'I was hurt. I'm a person just like anyone else,' Ms Blair told WUSA9. 'I have the same hopes, the same dreams, the same concerns as any other woman,' she added. After noticing an odd breast growth, Ms Blair, who doesn't have health insurance, went to the Planned Parenthood centre in Denver for a mammogram but was turned away for not being a woman . Ms Blair said that her daily intake of . sex hormone Estradiol had increased her risk of developing a variety of . tumours, including breast cancer, and believed her growth warranted further investigation. A spokesman for The Centers for Disease Control and . Prevention, which funds the programme, said it only covers clients who are 'genetically female'. But Ms Blair countered that after nearly 50 years of living as a male, it had not been an 'authentic' life and now describes herself as 'a real woman'. 'It's discrimination based on her . transgender status. I think that's pretty black and white,' her attorney, Sarah . Parady said. Ms Parady filed the lawsuit, claiming Ms Blair's experience was in violation of the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act, adding it was a 'terrible injustice'. Legal analyst Scott Robinson is now arguing for legislation as federal law on transgender issues is not clear enough. Ms Blair has since raised the money to pay for a mammogram - and has found she does not have breast cancer. Her legal crusade continues, though, . as she does not want others in a similar situation to be denied such . screenings, and wants to hold public organisations accountable. The Colorado Civil Rights Division issued a written response, saying the state programme is only following CDC guidelines. The . specifics of the lawsuit have not been reported.

Nearly 30 children have been hospitalised in China with severe organ failure after being struck by giant hornets. The latest wave of injuries comes after it was revealed that more than 40 people had been killed by the aggressive insects. A hospital in Guizhou province, in the south-west of the country, has had to treat dozens of children who were attacked by the 5cm-long animals. Scroll down for video . Torment: Fu Huanhuan, 16, is one of 30 children in hospital in China's Guizhou province after being stung by giant hornets . Attack: She was set upon by a swarm of 70 hornets which repeatedly stung her head . Treatment: Another child who suffered organ failure and had to receive a blood transfusion . The children were taken to hospital in a state of organ failure, and many have had to have several blood transfusions as well as haemodialysis to remove the toxins from their blood. Fu Huanhuan, 16, told ITN that she was working on a farm when more than 70 hornets started stinging her on the head. 'A lot of hornets surrounded my head,' he said. 'My head felt really sore and my heart started racing.' She almost died as a result of the stings, and is now in hospital recovering from her injuries. Epidemic: Dozens of youngsters have been affected by the activity of the huge insects . Nest: The hornets construct large structures which must be avoided by children . Some of the children were stung more than 200 times, according to one of the hospital doctors. The extraordinary spike in the number of hornet attacks has been ascribed to an increase in the vegetation which the insects live off. Victims of the attack have been left with deep, dark craters in their skin the size of bullet wounds. The Chinese term for hornets is 'hu feng' and local experts believe the culprit is the Asian giant hornet or Vespa mandarinia, which grows up to 5cm long with a 6mm sting. The insects' highly toxic stings can lead to anaphylactic shock and renal failure. Swarms of deadly hornets have killed more than 40 people and injured more than 1,600 in northern China . Victims of the attack have been left with deep, dark craters in their skin the size of bullet wounds . One victim told local media that 'the . more you run, the more they want to chase you' and some victims . described being chased about 200 metres (656 feet) by the deadly . insects. Authorities have mobilised a special medic team and trained more medical personnel to treat victims. One of the victims, named only as Mu, said she has spent two months in a hospital undergoing 13 dialysis treatments. She has 200 stitches, but still can not move her legs. She told Xinhua, the Chinese state-run news agency: 'The hornets were horrifying. 'They hit right at my head and covered my legs. All of a . sudden I was stung and I couldn't move. Even now, my legs are covered with sting holes.' Suffering: A patient shown covered in hornet stings in Shanxi province earlier this month . Horror: Some victims described being chased about 200 metres (656 feet) by a swarm . 'Most of the deaths are due to allergies to the venom, said Shunichi Makino, director general of the Hokkaido Research Centre for Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute. 'It's very difficult to prevent the attacks because hornet nests are usually in hidden sites,' he said. 'The venom of an Asian giant hornet is very special compared with other hornets or yellow jackets.' Meanwhile fears are growing that giant Asian hornets are headed for Britain. The species is four times the size of our native honeybees and has decimated the bee population in France. The dark invaders with yellow feet are thought to have arrive in France in a delivery of Chinese pottery from the Far East in late 2004. The insects have colonised huge swathes of France, spreading along waterways, and with a few hornets capable of destroying 30,000 bees in a couple of hours, honey production has plummeted.","Dozens of children in hospital in Guizhou province after being stung .

Internet forums on the McCann case were also awash with disgusting remarks about the Leicestershire couple. It was the mocked up picture of the McCanns as Hindley and Brady which particularly disgusted friends of the couple. One described the image, which was retweeted by other trolls, as ‘completely beyond the pale’ and there was mounting speculation last night that it could trigger police action. Detectives are now monitoring the Internet for vile messages about the McCanns. Investigation: The McCanns were interviewed as part of a Crimewatch programme with fresh information on the disappearance of Madeleine . A spokesman for the McCanns said: ‘Kate and Gerry do not dignify this sort of abusive material with any comment. ‘But if necessary offensive tweets are brought to the attention of the police.’ In July this year, police arrested a 25-year-old man on suspicion of harassment after Twitter abuse was aimed at a feminist campaigner and a female MP. Caroline Criado Perez and Walthamstow MP Stella Creasy both complained about being sent vicious tweets on the site. Labour MP Stella Creasy was told on Twitter she would be tracked down and raped while Tory MP Claire Perry received death threats relating to her fight against pornography on the internet. Feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez suffered similarly vile online messages - leading one alleged abuser to be arrested and bailed. In September 2012 the country’s chief prosecutor said internet trolls who post one-off offensive messages may escape criminal charges. Keir Starmer QC said court action would be taken only where there was a ‘sustained campaign of harassment’ or a direct threat. This, he said, was necessary, to protect free speech. The Director of Public Prosecutions made his comments as he announced that a semi-professional footballer who posted a homophobic tweet about Olympic diver Tom Daley would not face criminal charges. He said the comments were not so ‘grossly offensive’ that they should lead to a prosecution.Daniel Thomas sent the message about Daley, 18, and diving partner Peter Waterfield, 31, after the pair missed out on a medal at the London Olympics.Thomas was arrested after the tweet spread around the internet.It falsely suggested that Daley and Waterfield were in a gay relationship and drew a link between homosexuality and HIV. Under the 2003 Communications Act, it is an offence to send messages online that are grossly offensive.","The parents received a torrent of abuse on Twitter and on internet forums .

The cold case of a Cleveland girl who disappeared almost 19 years ago might finally be coming to end after human remains were discovered Friday under a busy highway overpass on the Ohio city’s west side. Convicted sex offender Edwin Acevedo Jr, 49, of Clevland, has been named a person of interest and was taken into custody only hours before the remains were discovered. Mr Acevedo is a career criminal with a history of sex-related crimes going back over 20 years. He might finally be the answer to the question that has haunted Cleveland since 1995 – what happened to Christina Adkins? Not so cold case: Edwin Castro Jr, 49, has been named a person of interest in the disappearance of Christina Adkins, missing since 1995 . The search human remains under the highway overpass began in earnest Friday morning, according to FBI special agent Vicki Anderson. A team of almost 30 people combed the remote area for hours before calling in the Cuyahoga County Coroner. Led by the FBI Violent Crimes Task Force, the search led to the discovery of an almost fully intact human skeleton, WKYC reported. Authorities believe it is likely the remains of the missing girl. The human bones were found only blocks from Ms Adkins' former home, and within walking distance of two other locations recently searched by officials. This is the second search in as many weeks, according to NewsChannel 5, authorities searched a nearby field last week and came up empty. No giving up: Investigators searched nearby locations in August and last week with hope of finding Ms Adkins remains . Final resting place: A skeleton found in this field is believed by officials to be the remains of Ms Adkins . Highly trafficked: Thousands of people drive past this overpass, only blocks from Ms Adkins' former home, on a daily basis . The remains are now with the medical examiner's office and will be compared against DNA from Ms Adkins family, it could anywhere from days to weeks to determine the identity. Ms Adkins was also 18-years-old when she went missing. The teen was five months pregnant when she went missing Jan 11, 1995 while walking to her boyfriend’s house in the same neighborhood terrorized by serial killer Anthony Sowell and dungeon master Ariel Castro. Neighbors of the missing girl expressed hope the case would soon be resolved. ‘We all figured that she was somewhere, probably not alive, because she never contacted anybody,’ a neighbor told NewsChannel  5. Still missing: Various wanted posters have been plastered all over Cleveland as her family and officials held out hope the case of her disappearance would be solved . ‘I wish they could have found her before her dad died, because I know that broke his heart,’ another neighbour said. ‘He didn’t know where she was.’ Another neighbour said the person responsible needs toconfess. ‘I think they need to step forward and say why they did it,’ a mother of a boy who once dated Ms Adkins told NewsChannel 5. ‘She was never harm to no one, she was a loving person, a giving person.’ Mr Acevedo, arrested only hours before the skeleton was discovered, was previously linked to the case during an August search of his home, but cleared. Officials appear confident they can prove this time he’s their man. Currently sitting in Cuyahoga County Jail, Mr Acevedo’s criminal history goes all the way back to 1998, when he was charged for theft and receiving stolen property, according to court records. Mr Acevedo was convicted of sexual battery in 2003, he served three years in prison for that offense. Find my daughter: Mary Adkins wants to know what happened to her missing daughter . The violent man was also charged this past June with two counts of rape for a June 1993 incident where he is accused of strangling an 18-year-old girl unconscious before twice raping her in a field, records cited by the Cleveland Plain-Dealer show. Officials were previously hopeful that Ms Adkins’ remains might be found among the bodies discovered rotting at serial killer Anthony Sowell’s house of horrors, but she was not among the 11 known victims. When news came of three women freed from kidnapper and sex torturer Ariel Castro’s house, the hope that Ms Adkins was among the victims was quickly dashed. Find my sister: Tonya Adkins doesn't want to find out her sister is dead, but she does want closure . The information that led officials to this latest discovery began pouring in around Labor Day, according to Ms Anderson, and it may finally bring closure to the missing girl’s tormented family. Speaking to NewsChannel 5, Tonya Adkins said its time for her missing sister’s story to have an ending. ‘I still want to know where my sister is and what happened to her.’ Mr Acevedo has yet to be charged in Ms Adkins disappearance, MailOnline was unable to reach officials for further comment.","Christina Adkins, 18-years-old at the time of her disappearance, has been missing since 1995 .

Lisa Loader feared for the life of an owl after she found a perfect imprint of it on one of her windows . Ms Loader, of Bridport, Dorset, said: 'I was scared I would go outside to find an owl lying on the ground - it looked like it hit the window really hard. 'Luckily, when I went out to take a look, there was nothing there, so we're hoping it survived.' Nik Shelton, who works for the RSPB, said the print was probably caused by the waterproofing residue found on owl feathers. He said: 'Owls have a natural residue which occasionally leaves this kind of mark on windows. 'If there was no owl lying around outside it probably picked itself up and flew off - most likely a bit dazed.' Lisa Loader initially feared for the life of the owl (not pictured) when she found the beautiful impression . He added: 'We do get sent pictures like this from time to time, but rarely with such detail. 'Hanging tinsel might help prevent this sort of thing.

Playwright Sir Tom Stoppard, 76, says he is struggling to find enough thinking time to come up with new ideas . Playwright Sir Tom Stoppard has admitted he has forgotten how to write a play. The Oscar-winning script-writer, who has penned more than 30 plays during his career, said his brain 'just isn't good enough anymore' and is struggling to focus. The 76-year-old, who wrote the screenplay for the Academy Award-winning film Shakespeare in Love, said it now takes him over a week to concentrate on a new project. Even though he has work planned for the next six months he is worried he does not have enough thinking time. Stoppard has written extensively for BBC radio in a career spanning more than 50 years. He has also been involved in writing Hollywood blockbusters such as Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. His last major work, an adaption of Parade's End which was nominated for an Emmy last month, took four years to complete. He told the Times2: 'When I was younger, I could do something useful just being free for half a day. 'But now I need five days to get the world I've left out of my head and ten days or a fortnight not talking to anyone to hold what I need to hold inside my head. 'I can't just put things aside for a day and come back.' Stoppard's most recent work for the theatre was Rock'n'Roll for the Royal Court in 2006. He has not revealed the title of his next play but has hinted it will be based on the intersection between 'science and metaphysics.' In 1939, Stoppard left Czechoslovakia as a child refugee, fleeing Nazi occupation, and settled with his family in Britain after the war. Deciding against a university education, he became a playwright  in 1960 after stints as a journalist and a drama critic. Awards: Stoppard and Marc Norman's script for the 1998 film Shakespeare in Love, starring Gwyneth Paltrow (pictured), won the Academy Award for Best Screenplay . Stoppard did not receive an official credit for his work on Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, but director Steven Spielberg said, 'he was responsible for almost every . line of dialogue in the film'. He also worked in a similar capacity with Tim Burton on his film Sleepy Hollow. Earlier this year, Stoppard wrote the play Darkside for BBC Radio 2, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Pink Floyd's album, The Dark Side of the Moon. In 2008, Stoppard was voted number 76 on the Time 100, Time magazine's list of the most influential people in the world.","The 76-year-old has penned 30 plays during his career and worked on films .

You’re a mediocre piece of s***. Get the f***out.

The cost of living in Britain is rising faster than anywhere in Europe, new figures reveal. The big squeeze on family finances is being exacerbated by wages failing to rise in line with prices. Increases in energy, food and alcohol prices are fuelling the high inflation rate in the UK, as political leaders clash over the effect on household disposable income. League table: New figures from Eurostat show how inflation in the UK is the highest in the EU . Official figures from the European Union today show that inflation in September was higher in the UK than in any of the 28 countries. One average annual inflation across the EU was 1.3 per cent last month. But in the UK the figure was 27 per cent, followed by Estonia (2.6 per cent) and the Netherlands (2.4 per cent). By comparison the lowest annual rates were seen in Bulgaria (-1.3 per cent), Greece (-1.0 per cent) and Latvia (-0.4 per cent). Food prices in the UK have risen by 4.3 per cent year-on-year, second highest only to Malta. Other countries seeing big increases in food include Finland (4.1 per cent), Germany (3.9 per cent) and Luxembourg and Slovenia (both 3.8 per cent). Outside the EU food prices are 8.6 per cent higher in Turkey and 5 per cent up in Iceland. Alcohol and tobacco costs have soared in many parts of Europe, rising by an eye-watering 12 per cent in Hungary, and more than 10 per cent in Cyprus, Croatia and Netherlands. Pressure: Prime Minister David Cameron clashed with Labour leader Ed Miliband over the cost of living crisis . Energy prices have risen by 3.4 per cent in the UK, only behind Norway, Turkey, Greece and Estonia, according to Eurostat figures. In many countries energy costs fell year-on-year, including in Bulgaria (-7 per cent), Hungary (-5.4 per cent) and Belgium (-5.3) per cent. While prices are up 2.7 per cent year-on-year in the UK, the squeeze on family incomes has worsened. In September pay was just 0.7 per cent higher than in 2012, down from 1.2 per cent in August. Catherine McKinnell, Labour’s shadow treasury minister, said: 'This is yet more evidence of the cost of living crisis facing families across Britain after three years of this Government’s failing policies. 'Prices have now risen faster than wages in 39 out of 40 months under David Cameron and now we learn that we have the highest rate of inflation of any EU country.' Squeeze: Family finances are still under pressure with pay up just 0.7 per cent year-on-year while inflation is up 2.7 per cent . In the Commons today, Labour leader Ed Miliband accused the government of overseeing a ‘cost of living crisis’. Mr . Miliband said latest figures  show ‘that prices have risen faster than . wages and that in the 39 out of 40 months living standards have fallen . since you became Prime Minister’. He added: ‘There are almost a million young people and record numbers of people working part-time who can't find full-time work. That is no cause for complacency from this Government.’ However, Mr Cameron insisted that disposable incomes were now rising. Mr Cameron suggested workers were seeing the effects of the economic recovery, as he told MPs many households had seen an increase in their spending on non-essential items. The PM added: ‘Of course, we all want to see living standards improve. Last year, disposable income increased but the way to deliver on living standards is to grow the economy, keep producing the jobs and cut taxes.’","Inflation in the UK in September was 2.7%, highest in the whole of the EU .

Almost half a million Iraqis have died as a result of the conflict in their country, shock new figures have revealed. According to a study of the war-torn nation, an estimated 461,000 natives have been killed between March 2003 and June 2011 as a direct or indirect result of the fighting. The research, published in the PLOS Medicine journal, concludes with grave warning that the war in Iraq is 'far from over' and continues to claim lives at an 'alarming rate'. Traumatic memories: Householders in Iraq were asked to recall how many family members they had lost and how their loved ones died. In this picture, from 2006, an Iraqi 13 year-old-boy's coffin is carried by relatives . Shocking: The figures were edited with a note from researchers who said that the war in Iraq was 'far from over'. In this picture, from 2006, men mourn over the coffin of a victim of bombings in the holy city of Najaf . Most of the fatalities in the grim total are attributable to violence, the study said. But around a third were the result of indirect war-related events such as failures in health care systems and collapses in the crucial supply of networks and sanitation. Gunshots were the cause of 62 per cent of violent deaths, with car bombs and other explosions accounting for 12 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively. Heart conditions are the leading cause of non-violent deaths in the country. The figures were drawn up by a team of researchers from Iraq and the US, led by Amy Hagopian, of the University of Washington, after a survey of 2,000 households in Iraq between May and July 2011. Every household head was asked about births and deaths since 2001 and all household adults were also asked about mortality among their siblings. Leaders: Tony Blair, (left), former Prime Minister and former USA President George Bush sanctioned the Iraq invasion to bring down Saddam Hussein's regime . The study calculated that there was a more than 50 per cent higher crude death rate in the period between March 1, 2003 and June 30, 2011 than in the 26-months which preceded the war. The researchers that say that is a total in 405,000 'excess' which can be attributed to conflict. A further 56,000 deaths were missed, the study estimated, as a result of migration out of the country. British troops joined the US invasion of Iraq to overthrow Saddam Hussein in March 2003. The British forces lost 179 servicemen and women in the conflict whereas the American's death toll reached 4,448 during their eight year operation. Combat operations by UK troops ended in 2009 with the US ending combat operations the following year. The editors' summary of the report said the Iraqi death toll figures represented the most up-to-date estimates available from the middle eastern nation. But it said the estimates could still be associated with 'substantial difficulties' because there was such a small representative sample of households. Researchers also had to draw numbers based on recollections from respondents of incidents which could have happened up to a decade earlier. Military deaths: Two-thirds of the death toll were military related. Here, US soldiers remove the body of a victim after a suicide bomber attack in Ramadi in 2006 . Cost of war: The report concluded that there has been 405,000 'excess' deaths as a result of the war, meaning that is the number of people who may have lived had the conflict never happened . The researchers also had to rely on outdated census figures for their overall population figures. In a summary, the report said that they were 95 per cent sure that the actual death toll lies between 48,000 and 751,000.' I continued: 'More than two years past the end of the period covered in this study, the conflict in Iraq is far from over and continues to cost lives at alarming rates.; . The estimate is the first to be issued since 2006. Then, claims that 655,000 Iraqis had died as a result of the conflict were described as 'nowhere near accurate' by the then Labour Government. US researchers came up with that figure based on interviews with more than 1,800 households.","Study claims to show true, shocking cost of the conflict in Iraqi deaths .

But her bright smile and glamorous outfit on Monday night at the Pride of Britain awards disguised the dramatic health scare she underwent earlier this year which prompted her weight loss. The veteran TV presenter, 73, was diagnosed with blood poisoning and in hospital for ten days on an oral antibiotic and two intravenous ones after slicing through her left index finger with a knife as she cleaned meat from a lamb bone. At the time of the accident, Miss Hunniford believed she had a superficial cut that needed nothing more than a plaster. Two days later however her hand was three times its normal size, hours later she was feverish and found she had an ‘ominous weal’ running up the inside of her left arm almost to her armpit. Taken to A&E by her husband of 15 years, celebrity hairdresser Stephen Way, doctors immediately hooked her up to a drip and IV antibiotics. In an interview in May Miss Hunniford revealed: ‘It was a bit of a shock as I am pretty healthy in general and had no idea that this sort of thing could happen from a simple nick to the finger. ‘Doctors said it was just one of those things but that bacterial infections from raw or cooked meat are the worst. ‘Apparently if someone gets playfully scratched by a cat, they should be careful, as those sorts of wounds can develop into infections. Gloria Hunniford, pictured with her husband Stephen Way, at the Pride of Britain awards . ‘When I first arrived at hospital I did ask a doctor if my kind of infection could be serious and his reply was that before antibiotics had been discovered, people died of this type of blood poisoning, which was sobering. ‘In my right arm, which the IV needle was going onto, I developed cellulitis – an infection under the skin – which needed treating as well.’ In order to restore her health Miss Hunniford decided to embark on a no sugar, no carbs diet and also took multivitamins and probiotics. She described her new eating plan as a ‘bit like the New Atkins. I feel a lot better on that kind of diet as it stabilises blood sugar levels.’ Last night a spokeswoman for Miss Hunniford said: ‘Gloria has always looked after herself well and her message has always been about being healthy, especially as she gets older.

Dwayne 'Megaman' Vincent has avoided jail for punching a clubber in the face during a mass nightclub brawl . A founding member of rap group So Solid Crew punched a nightclubber in the face during a mass brawl, in which a teenager was stabbed and another slashed with a champagne bottle. Dwayne ‘Megaman’ Vincent hit the fellow clubber after two rival groups clashed outside a club in Birmingham last February . The 32-year-old was at the popular city centre nightspot the Sugar Suite to support his fellow So Solid member Romeo, also 32, who was making a guest DJ appearance. However, trouble flared after they turned up late. A court heard bottles were thrown from the crowd at the stage and as two groups fought on the dance floor a 19-year-old man was stabbed in the back and another teen suffered slash wounds from a broken champagne bottle. The controversial hip hop group were then led by their minders out of the club via a rear exit before the violence spilled outside and into the city’s Broad Street entertainment district. Warwick Crown Court heard Vincent had then punched a man in the face who he believed was carrying a knife. The London-born rapper was arrested on March 2 last year, two weeks after the incident on February 17. Vincent pleaded guilty to affray at an earlier hearing and on Monday walked free from court. He was given a conditional discharge for two years and ordered to pay just £60 costs at Warwick Crown Court. Sentencing Judge Alan Parker said he was taking into account the delay and set the costs at the level which would have been imposed if the matter had remained in the magistrates court. The So Solid Crew founding member floored the reveller after two rival groups clashed outside the Sugar Suite club in Birmingham (pictured) last February. The 32-year-old had gone to the popular city centre nightspot to support rap pal Romeo, 32, who was making a guest appearance on the decks . Vincent, from Hammersmith, London, entered his guilty plea to one charge of affray on the basis he became separated from the others and heard there was a man with a knife. Defending Alice Jarrett claimed after seeing someone with his hand at his side, Vincent believed that was the person with the blade and punched him. Ms Jarrett said her client had been waiting a long time for the case to be dealt with, which had caused him a considerable amount of stress. So Solid Crew soared to national fame in 2001, reaching number one with their first single ‘21 Seconds’. But the Brit Award-winning band have been dogged by controversy and their debut tour in 2001 had to be called off after a series of incidents.

A youth who had been to one of their concerts was killed by fans using baseball bats and knives and two people were shot during another show at the London Astoria. At least two members of the band have been stabbed and another was shot and wounded. Vincent was quizzed over the stabbing of rapper Dizzee Rascal in Cyprus in 2003 but was quickly eliminated from inquiries. He was also cleared of murder in 2006 after a jury acquitted him of encouraging his friend Carl Morgan to shoot Colin Scarlett. The 24-year-old was gunned down in a south London street after he 'dissed' Morgan - another So Solid Crew member by beating him up. An original jury convicted Morgan but could not agree a verdict on Vincent - and a later retrial was then aborted. But a third jury returned a not guilty verdict after two days of deliberation.","Dwayne ‘Megaman’ Vincent hit man after two groups clashed outside club .

A young woman suffers from a rare condition which means she has already had to have both knees and hips replaced at just 27. Natalie Wright was five when she was diagnosed with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), . She believes it was triggered by a simple viral infection she suffered in her first year at school. She recalls being sent home, but 24 . hours later she couldn’t move any part of her body and didn't return to school for 18 months. She said: 'It just came on completely randomly and when I tried to move, I just screamed in pain. Ms Wright has already had one of her shoulders replaced and both knees and hips rebuilt with metal and plastic joints after her natural bones were worn down by the disease. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a childhood form of arthritis, a condition which affects just 15,000 children and young people in the UK. It can begin at any age including babies and toddlers, up until the age of 16 . There is currently no cure but for some people with JIA, the arthritis can be very mild and the symptoms disappear after a few years. Others need to be treated for the rest of their lives. Ms Wright, from Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, was diagnosed with JIA using a blood test and X-rays. She was confined to a wheelchair due to the pain the condition caused her, while the correct dosage of IV steroids and immunoglobins were configured to help her control her mobility and pain. She said: 'I spent most of my childhood years trying to get on track and lead a semi-normal life. 'There have been times when I have been able to walk unaided or on crutches but other times I was bedridden. 'I couldn’t be very active but I had a normal school life and it was just the PE lessons that I missed.' Ms Wright in hospital aged six. She believes her condition was triggered by a viral infection which left her unable to move . Seven years ago, at the age of 20, she had her first replacement - her hip. She said: 'Every time I tried to stand up my hip locked. 'I couldn’t straighten up and it became extremely painful. I couldn’t even walk from my bedroom to the kitchen.' Then just a week after graduating as a trained occupational therapist a year later, in 2007, her other hip required surgery. She was also forced to have one . of her shoulders replaced in 2011, after the muscle weakness became so . poor and she had daily pain. Ms Wright had to have a shoulder replacement (left) in 2011 and knee replacements (right) earlier this year . 'I . would have to be really bad to have the other one done,' she said. 'It’s still agony now and the rehabilitation was the worst of all my . joints.'

Almost destroyed and littered with unexploded bombs, it suffered some of the worst bombing of any airfield during the Battle of Britain and has a rich history of flight. But Manston Airport, near Margate, Kent - where Dambusters ace Sir Barnes Wallace carried out tests on the revolutionary bouncing bomb during the Second World War - has been sold for just £1. The location, which is now called Kent’s International Airport and operated from by Dutch airline KLM, was used in 1943 to test the bomb before it was used in the raid on Germany’s Ruhr valley.

In flight: The location, which is now called Kent's International Airport and operated from by Dutch airline KLM, was used in 1943 to test the bomb before it was used in the raid on Germany's Ruhr valley . Days gone by: A section of four Supermarine Spitfire Mark IAs of No 92 Squadron RAF, taking off from Manston, Kent, February 1941, just months after much of the airfield had been destroyed during the Battle of Britain . Manston was regularly used by badly-damaged aeroplanes because it was so close to the front-line and had a long runway, becoming an emergency landing ground for bomber crews on the east coast. There have been persistent rumours of a mutiny at Manston during the Battle of Britain, with claims that ground crew were so angered by constant attacks on the airfield that they lost their morale. It has been suggested that the men refused to come out of their air raid shelter, and only emerged when threatened by an officer with a gun. However, claims of any mutiny have never been proven. The airport, historically known as RAF Manston, has been bought from infrastructure investment firm Infratil by entrepreneur Ann Gloag, one of the co-founders of transport company Stagecoach. Preparations: Sir Barnes Wallace (pictured in 1945) used the base to test his bouncing bomb on the coast at nearby Reculver prior to the Dambusters raid in 1943 during the Second World War . Historic: Manston Airport was later renamed Kent's International Airport and is pictured here in May 1989 . The 71-year-old has set up a new firm to buy and operate the airfield - which has a mile-long runway, a terminal capable of handling five million passengers a year, and proposals for a London train link. In May 16 1943, 19 aircraft set out to destroy three dams in the Ruhr valley - the Mohne, the Eder and the Sorpe - to damage a vital source of power to the key industrial area of Germany. The Mohne and Eder Dams in the industrial heart of Germany were attacked and breached by mines dropped from specially modified Lancasters of 617 Squadron. Using bouncing bombs, their night-time raid saw the mission hailed a success. The Sorpe dam was was also attacked by two aircraft and damaged. A fourth dam, the Ennepe, was reported as being attacked by a single aircraft, but with no damage. An estimated 1,294 people were killed by flood waters, but eight of the 19 aircraft that went on the mission failed to return. There was a loss of 53 aircrew - and three were taken as prisoners. Mrs Gloag said: ‘I am delighted to have purchased Manston Airport from Infratil as I believe there is real potential for growth that has not been fully captured. ‘I have said for 25 years now that the airport will never really succeed until we have a one-hour link from London to Manston. That is achievable and on track.’ Infratil said the airport was being sold for a ‘cash . consideration of £1, plus an adjustment for working capital variances and cash . injected by Infratil’ - expected to be around £350,000. The airfield’s buildings were destroyed during the Battle of Britain in 1940, three years before Sir Barnes used the base to test his bomb on the coast at Reculver prior to the Dambusters raid. Thanet North Conservative MP Roger Gale said: ‘We now have a company taking over the airport that recognises its potential. I think the sale is very good news for those employed at Manston.’ Mrs Gloag scooped the Business Woman of the Year Award in 1990 for Stagecoach, a firm she and her 59-year-old brother Sir Brian Souter started with one bus in 1980.

The Home Office accepted liability for basic and aggravated damages to compensate for the period of 23 days unlawful detention . A foreign national jailed for 12 months for robbery has been awarded £25,000 damages because he was detained too long while attempts were made to deport him. In June last year, the High Court ruled that Algerian citizen Aziz Lamari should have been released the previous month. This was based on how there was no realistic prospect of him being removed within a reasonable time frame and medical reports revealed he was suffering from serious mental illness and had twice attempted suicide. It also found that the Home Secretary Theresa May was in contempt of court because her department failed to release Lamari after it accepted he should no longer be in detention and gave an undertaking to release him into suitable accommodation. Lamari, 23, who has now returned to Algeria, was detained after his robbery sentence came to an end in December 2010 and his deportation ordered. After Judge Barry Cotter’s ruling, the Home Office accepted liability for basic and aggravated damages to compensate for the period of 23 days unlawful detention, but denied liability for exemplary damages. Today, the judge awarded £10,000 basic compensation plus £5,000 aggravated damages and took the exceptional step of saying the case called for an award of £10,000 exemplary damages 'by way of punishment, to deter and to vindicate the strength of the law'. He said that the unlawful detention had to be seen in the light of Lamari’s serious mental health problems and the evidence of his significant deterioration, as witnessed by his cellmate, could not be ignored. 'It had been clearly set out that the continued detention of the claimant was the cause of his mental health problems and had been the likely cause of two serious suicide attempts. The judge at the High Court said that the award of exemplary damages was an 'exceptional remedy' 'The defendant acted contrary to her undertaking in the full knowledge of the effect that the claimant’s unlawful detention had on his mental health.' Other aggravating features were the contempt of court and the fact that when Lamari was released, on June 14 2012, no warning had been given to the manager of the bail accommodation and he was forced to sleep rough outside without food or water. The judge said that this amounted to 'little short of contempt' for the well being of a man who spoke no English and was in a poor state. 'Worse still the position he was placed in was likely to tempt him to abscond or seek money or food with potential consequences for members of the public. 'In the absence of any other information as to how events came to pass I consider it as little short of shameful conduct. 'The courts hear criticism of the approach of other countries to the welfare of individuals pending immigration or asylum decisions with the assumption that such conduct could never occur here. 'However, this case proves that all may not always be as it should be. I sincerely hope that following this judgment the circumstances of the claimant’s release are carefully reviewed.' The judge said: 'I have little hesitation in finding that the relevant conduct in this case was indeed outrageous. 'I find that there was an extraordinary, wilful and highhanded disregard of the court and the claimant’s rights flowing from his success at court. 'The disregard of the court was arbitrary and unconstitutional and taken against the background of the claimant’s mental health - which had led to the undertaking and order - it was most obviously oppressive.' He said that it was not just a question of the Secretary of State - as it had been in other cases - 'not covering herself in glory'. 'This was of a very different and most serious order. There was a gross misuse of power in continuing to detain the claimant despite the undertaking and an order of the court that required his release.” The judge said that the award of exemplary damages was an 'exceptional remedy'. 'However, in light of the egregious conduct of the Secretary of State in this matter an award of basic and aggravated damages, taken together with the fact of a finding of contempt, publicity and costs would not be sufficient punishment. 'This case calls for an award of exemplary damages by way of punishment, to deter and to vindicate the strength of the law.' Lamari first arrived in the UK in July 2009 and applied for asylum but then absconded and was returned from the Netherlands but absconded again. In April 2010 he was arrested on suspicion of robbery and convicted the following August.","Aziz Lamari was jailed for 12 months for robbery and detained too long .

A Tory energy minister last night called for a boycott of Britain’s second biggest energy firm after it put up bills by an average of £111 a year. As a winter chill swept across the country, SSE said tariffs will rise by an inflation-busting 8.2 per cent for its 7.3million customers. The increase will take their annual bill close to £1,500, leaving millions facing a nightmare choice between heating and eating. Energy and business minister Michael Fallon condemned the increase and advised SSE customers to switch to a cheaper rival. The firm hit back, blaming government green taxes and associated measures for pushing up bills. It said ministers should shift the cost of subsidising green energy, such as building wind farms, away from bills to general taxation. Labour leader Ed Miliband seized on the news to justify his promise to impose a 20-month freeze on energy prices if he is elected in 2015. However, Mr Miliband is vulnerable on the issue after he championed green taxes when he was Energy Secretary in the last Labour government. The SSE price rise comes into effect on November 15. Other major suppliers, such as British Gas, E.on, Npower and Scottish Power, are expected to announce large increases within days. Mr Fallon said: ‘I would encourage all customers to look again at their tariffs and see if they can switch to a cheaper tariff. It is important that consumers have the power and information to be able to switch accounts. We are encouraging that by simplifying the tariff structure.’ The wholesale price of energy, which makes up half the bill, is up by 4 per cent compared to a year ago. In theory, this should put bills up by only 2 per cent. SSE said it was increasing prices by 8.2 per cent because green taxes, which make up 10 per cent of the bill, have jumped by 13 per cent in a year. SSE said it was increasing prices by 8.2 per cent because of green taxes . Secondly, the amount companies are charged to maintain and improve the national grid of cables and pipes, which equates to 25 per cent of the bill, is up 10 per cent in a year. Much of this work is associated with green energy. The company said removing the green tax element from bills and transferring the cost to general taxation would reduce the annual figure by £110. Ed Miliband was the architect of the green taxes blamed for pushing up energy bills. The Labour leader was in charge of energy policy in Gordon Brown’s Labour government, and made tackling climate change his main priority. He argued that imposing green taxes on consumer bills was vital to raise the money needed to fund a shift to wind farms and other renewable energy. In November 2009, he said he fully understood that this policy would push up bills, but argued it was a price worth paying. Mr Miliband said: ‘It needs a willingness to take the argument to people about the tough choices involved in tackling climate change. 'This is the starting point: a willingness to engage with people on, for example, the fact that to deal with the problem of climate change, energy bills are likely to rise.’ In January 2010, he promised to push ahead, saying: ‘Yes, there are upward pressures on energy bills, and that makes life difficult for people, including those in fuel poverty, but it is right that we go down the low-carbon energy route.’ Now, Mr Miliband is presenting himself as a champion of those suffering from the high cost of heat and light, demanding a 20-month price freeze. SSE group managing director Will Morris apologised to customers but accused politicians of pushing up costs. ‘We know we will come in for a great deal of criticism for this decision and politicians will no doubt be lining up to condemn us,’ he said. ‘But over many years policy-makers themselves have failed to highlight adequately the cost to consumers of the policies they have pursued in government. 'They can’t expect to have power stations replaced with new technologies, the network to be upgraded and nationwide energy efficiency schemes all to be funded for free.’ Mr Miliband ran the Department for Energy & Climate Change in the last government and was behind the green taxes driving up bills. Now, he is trying to win over voters by promising a price freeze. Yesterday, he said: ‘This latest scandal shows why the Government needs to act. The companies are trying to blame everyone else, the Government is trying to blame everyone else. They’re responsible, they’re not getting a grip.’ Yesterday, David Cameron dismissed the Labour leader’s price freeze promise as a ‘con’. ‘He is not in control of the worldwide price of gas and so he can’t guarantee keeping that promise,’ he said. ‘What we need to do is make changes to the energy market to make sure we can have low prices and hopefully keep those low prices for as long possible. 'We’ve got to address the causes of prices rather than just come up with what is effectively a con.’ Consumer bodies slammed SSE’s price rise. Consumer Futures director Adam Scorer said: ‘SSE and others who follow need to demonstrate why this rise is justified. ‘But the Government also has to acknowledge that energy policy costs are adding to consumer bills and carbon taxes will make that burden heavier still.’ Executive director at Which?, Richard Lloyd, added: ‘We want the Government to intervene to make sure everything possible is done to keep prices in check. We need simpler pricing, we need to break the stranglehold of the biggest energy companies . . . and the Government must make sure that its own policies are not adding unnecessary costs to consumers’ bills.’","Michael Fallon condemned price hikes by energy giant SSE .

Stolen: These three-month-old dachshund puppies were stolen in the raid along with four miniature schnauzers and a toy poodle . Greyhound trainer Mrs Cross is now fearing for the safety of the dogs - particularly her two pregnant schnauzers. Mrs Cross and her husband Ronnie arrived home from their wedding at 11.45pm to find only three of their ten dogs had been left behind. Mrs Cross, 49, said: 'We came back in the car and Ronnie wanted to get me as close to the back door as possible so I wouldn’t ruin my dress. 'But as he opened the gate and the car lights shone on to the kennels, I could see the doors had all been forced open and three of the dogs were running loose. 'The thieves had taken seven of the dogs out from the kennels, round the back and across the field.' The bride, who was one of the first in the country to successfully breed the ‘snoodle’ - a cross between a poodle and a miniature schnauzer - had to quickly change out of her wedding dress to catch the remaining three dogs. Discovery: Mrs Cross and her husband Ronnie arrived home from their wedding to find only three of their ten dogs had been left behind . Kennels: The newlyweds discovered all of the doors to her kennels had been forced open after they arrived home . She said: 'I had just got married and this wasn’t the way I wanted to spend my wedding night. 'I have been a breeder for 25 years and I have never had any trouble, I’ve certainly never had a dog stolen. 'I worry how they are, as they won’t know who they’re with and they will sense each other’s fear. 'I just hope they are being treated well. I have been having nightmares and I can see the thieves grabbing the dogs in my sleep. I keep trying to rescue them, but I’m not able to.' The mother-of-one believes the theft was . planned and the dogs were likely to have been taken by someone who . knows the family’s routine. Last dog left: Mrs Cross has given away two of her remaining dogs since the break-in, leaving her with just one 15-month-old schnauzer, called Gabby (pictured) She said: 'It had to be someone who knew we were out. 'We left here at 3pm and were out for the rest of the day, and we were hardly going to come back home as we were getting married. 'They came wanting the dogs. They only wanted to get into the kennels, as the house wasn’t touched. 'I just hope they are being treated well. I have been having nightmares and I can see the thieves grabbing the dogs in my sleep' - Diane Cross . 'It’s an isolated house and they would have known they wouldn’t be seen.' The thieves also vandalised a white Transit van and left behind two gloves, one leather and one plastic, inside the kennel. PC Johanna Maden, from Rishton’s neighbourhood policing team, appealed for information about the incident, which happened between 3pm and 11.45pm on Saturday, September 21. She said: 'The RSPCA has also been notified and is checking all the pet sales websites. 'It should be noted that two of the female schnauzers are pregnant. The owners of these dogs have been left devastated and we want to do all we can to reunite them with their pets.' Mrs Cross hopes someone may know where her dogs are, and can help get them back to her before the two female dogs are due to give birth to up to 12 puppies between them. Theft: Mrs Cross said she believed the theft was planned and had been carried out by someone who knew the family's routine . 'How can seven fully-grown dogs just disappear?' she said. 'The two pregnant schnauzers are likely to be showing now and need to get to the vets. I worry that whoever has them will panic when they realise they are expecting puppies. 'One has had puppies before, so she might be alright, but the other one is likely to have difficulties without any help as this is her first litter. 'I’m just praying someone may know where they are.' Since the break-in, Mrs Cross has given away two of her remaining dogs, leaving her with just one 15-month-old schnauzer, called Gabby. 'I have brought her in the house so she’s not on her own,' Mrs Cross added. 'She’s howling and ever so terrified. You can see that she’s missing the other dogs desperately and probably remembers what happened that night. 'I have never felt so unsafe in my own home. I feel violated.'","Diane and Ronnie Cross discovered kennel doors broken after wedding .

In Brazil, powerful gangs often linked . to the drug trade are very powerful and frequently control whole . prisons and favelas, or shanty towns. Since 2002, the PCC has been led by Marcos Willians Herbas Camacho, known as Marcola, or 'Playboy.' The . gang have nicknames including Wander Eduardo 'Fat Face' Ferrari, Isaias . 'Weird' Moreira do Nascimento and Antonio 'Ugly Beast' Carlos dos . Santos. During 2012, a war broke out between the gang and Sao Paulo's Military Police. They . felt the government had violated an informal agreement, long denied by . officials, to slow the prison transfers of gang leaders and limit . crackdowns on its operations on Sao Paulo's outskirts in exchange for an . end to gang violence. Threat: Brazil's biggest drug cartel has promised a 'World Cup of terror' next year - in a reminder of the high level of violence that still marks the country . Battle: Last night violent demonstrations exploded on the streets of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo with protesters setting fire to cars and fighting pitched battles with police . Anger: The protests across Brazil last night were in support of a teachers' strike . Tension: The protests were the latest in a long line of unrest that has seen millions take to the streets in Brazil to protest against the government . The gang ordered attacks on police, 106 officers - many off-duty - were killed. In the protests in Rio de Janeiro, a group of masked youths attacked shops, set fire to a police car and threw petrol bombs. In Sao Paulo shops were ransacked. Police responded with tear gas, pepper spray and sound bombs. Efforts . to transfer high-ranking imprisoned members of the gang, known by its . Portuguese initials PCC, to far off prisons where they would have . difficulty giving orders by cellphone to their soldiers on the outside . enraged the gang in 2006. Demands: Protesters oppose a pay proposal by the city's mayor, saying it doesn't go far enough in addressing their demands, according to published reports . Unstable: A police car burns during clashes following a largely peaceful protest by teachers and supporters . Injured: Demonstrators help the staff of a McDonald's store during the clash between anti-government demonstrators and riot police . Bitter: A pile of chairs are set on fire as demonstrators illustrate their frustration . Demonstrations: A protester spray paints a government building as the clashes erupt . Five . days of gang-inspired attacks then left at least 175 dead, including . police officers, traffickers and the innocent in between. After the . violence lingered for months, an alleged informal truce between the . government and the PCC slowed the transfers and the attacks tapered off. The . gang was founded in 1993 by hardened criminals inside Sao Paulo's . Taubate Penitentiary, but remained a relatively obscure group until . early 2001, when uprisings in 29 prisons across the state killed 19 . inmates. It was the biggest prison rebellion in Brazil's recent history . and took police 27 hours to crush. The PCC was formed to pressure for improved prison conditions. Jubilant: England captain Steven Gerrard celebrates his goal with teammates Wayne Rooney and Daniel Welbeck during their 2014 World Cup qualifying soccer match against Poland at Wembley last night . Brazilian . Justice Minister Jose Cardozo, speaking at a security conference last . year, said he would 'prefer to die' than serve time in his nation's . prisons. He added: 'We have a medieval penal system.' While . the gang's start may have been rooted in fighting for basic human . rights of the imprisoned, its members quickly began using their power . inside prisons to direct drug-dealing and extortion operations on the . outside. 'The PCC is better . organized, more powerful, and they have a monopoly of crimes and power . which is something nobody achieved in Rio,' said Ignacio Cano, a . researcher at the Violence Analysis Center at Rio de Janeiro State . University. 'They are by far the strongest criminal group in Brazil.' There . are no official numbers on the gang's size, but the inner core . considered as members is thought to include no more than a few thousand . people, Cano said. Preparations: The Olympic Village under construction in Rio de Janeiro this week . Police documents obtained by the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo last year indicated the gang's members numbered just over 1,300, and showed they are required to pay $300 in monthly fees in exchange for legal aid if they're arrested and support for their families if they go to jail. What makes the PCC so powerful is that corporate approach to how it manages gang enterprises as well as its reach beyond its core membership. 'They outsource. They contract people and allow them to carry out certain activities as long as they're paying them (the PCC) something in return,' Cano said. 'For example, in 2006 many people say the killings of policemen were outsourced.' Estimates of the number of people connected in some way to the gang go as high as 100,000.","The threat was issued by the First .

A man hailed a hero after saving his wife’s life after her heart stopped for nearly an hour was secretly betraying her by looting the homes of her parents and grandmother. Michael Corke, 32, was given a 'super dad' award by ITV’s Daybreak after performing CPR on his wife Lisa when she collapsed at home. Lisa's heart stopped for 55 minutes but she was kept alive by Corke who was talked through the live-saving first aid treatment by an emergency call handler. Fake: Michael Corke was painted out to be a perfect husband after juggling self-employment, raising two children and caring for his wife after he saved her life - but he was secretly stealing from his in-laws . Grateful Lisa wrote to Daybreak praising her husband for juggling life as a self-employed carpenter and caring for daughters Ellie, four, and baby Amelie, one, during her recovery. But at the same time hard-up Corke was stealing cash and jewellery from his parents-in-law and Lisa’s grandmother Joan Gillham, 79. A month after his wife’s collapse he raided Mrs Gillham’s bungalow in Minster, Kent, while she was on holiday in Spain. She returned to find £150 in cash, jewellery and china from 1907 ocean liner RMS Mauretania missing. The loot was found in a shed when Lisa’s father, mortgage consultant Alex Mitchell, 55, became suspicious. Jailed: Corke gladly accepted the 'Super dad' ITV award after his wife Lisa wrote in to praise him . Betrayed: The judge at Maidstone Crown Court said Corke had betrayed his wife and family . He also found stolen and pawned jewellery, including a 9ct gold ring, taken from his family two months after the burglary on Mrs Gillham. Maidstone Crown Court heard that an insurance claim for the missing property totalled £13,000. Corke admitted theft and was jailed for four years by Judge Charles Byers who told him he had 'betrayed' his family. He said: 'These were mean offences. 'You were trusted in homes of those people who treated you as a third grandson. You betrayed that trust.' Jailed: Corke now faces four years in jail for betraying his family and stealing from his in-laws. His wife Lisa has divorced him . The court heard that Lisa has since divorced Corke, of Minster, Kent. Outside court her mother Tracy Mitchell, 55, said: 'Right to the bitter end he has shown no remorse whatsoever to my family. It was absolutely devastating.' Medics later discovered Lisa had a hereditary heart condition called Long QT where her heart can stop if she becomes over-excited. The same condition was responsible for claiming the life of her grandfather who died laughing at an episode of The Goodies in 1975.","Michael Corke performed CPR on his wife whose heart stopped for an hour .

Probe: A former inspector accused of 'acting on behalf' of Jimmy Savile by contacting Surrey Police officers before they interviewed the paedophile presenter is being formally investigated . A former inspector accused of 'acting on behalf' of Jimmy Savile by contacting Surrey Police officers before they interviewed the paedophile presenter is being formally investigated, it was revealed today. The man, who worked for West Yorkshire Police, will be probed by the Independent Police Complaints Commission over claims he helped the sex offender in 2009. Savile had been accused of abusing girls at Duncroft Children’s Home in the late 1970s - but was let off just before his death. The IPCC was brought in after it emerged the detective, known only as Inspector 5, may have interfered on Savile's behalf. It came on the day after Surrey Police released transcripts of a 56-minute interview with them in 2009, two years before he died, where he fobbed them off with lies, bluster and legal threats. Jimmy Savile ran rings around detectives probing child sex claims against him. The 83-year-old said accusations from three of his teenage victims were the ‘complete fantasy’ of people ‘looking for a few quid’. Savile even boasted he ‘owned’ the NHS hospital at Stoke Mandeville and said he brushed off girls ‘like midges’. He also admitted entertaining . officers from West Yorkshire Police at his home in Leeds, and that they . were aware of previous ‘blackmail attempts’ from ‘weirdos’ but because . he was ‘easy-going’ they had not investigated them. Repeatedly reminding the Surrey detectives of his charity work, he feigned incredulity at each allegation they put to him. The transcripts show the officers treated Savile with kid gloves and pose the question whether a more determined approach could have led to his prosecution. Surrey Police released this transcript of an interview with Jimmy Savile in October, 2009, following sexual assault allegations at Stoke Mandeville Hospital and a children's home . Accusations: Jimmy Savile visited Duncroft Approved School for Girls in the 1970s, pictured here in 1974, where he allegedly attacked several young women. It is not suggested that any of the women are in this picture . In March the policing watchdog HMIC identified 11 failures in the case, including the ‘lack of challenge to Savile’s assertions’. The transcripts were released by Surrey Police following a freedom of information request. A major review of the decision not to charge Savile in 2009 concluded in January there was nothing to suggest the victims had colluded in their stories, or that they were unreliable. Yet police and prosecutors treated the claims to Surrey Police – and one made by a fourth victim to Sussex Police – ‘with a degree of caution which was neither justified nor required’. The report by senior CPS lawyer Alison Levitt, QC, was released in tandem with an official police probe into the DJ’s 60 years of abuse. It was revealed that he raped 34 women and girls and sexually assaulted up to 450, including children as young as eight. The HMIC said it was wrong to allow Savile to choose where and when his ‘ineffective’ interview took place. Savile at Stoke Mandeville. He claimed to 'own' the hospital . 'I run this hospital': Savile, speaking to a patient at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in 1990, was interviewed under caution by police two years before his death (file picture) Savile was interviewed under caution on October 1, 2009, in his office at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, where police now believe he abused scores of patients he was supposedly helping through his volunteer work. At the beginning of the interview, the officers politely asked Savile whether it was ‘OK’ to call him Jimmy and thanked him for ‘kindly’ letting them use his office to conduct the interview. They had received an allegation in May 2007 that Savile had sexually assaulted a teenage girl at Duncroft Children’s Home in Staines in the late 1970s. In the investigation that followed, two more allegations emerged – the first that in about 1973 Savile had sexually assaulted a girl aged about 14 outside Stoke Mandeville Hospital. The second was that in the 1970s Savile had suggested to a girl aged about 17, again at Duncroft, that she perform a sex act on him. Asked to comment on claims he abused a girl in the TV room at Duncroft, he replied ‘it never happened and it is a fabrication’. Told that he was accused of putting a girl’s hand on his groin area, he snapped: ‘It’s starting to sound like the Mad Hatter’s tea party this’. Savile, now regarded as Britain’s most prolific child sex predator, furiously denied suggestions he was attracted to underage girls. Publication of the interviews will reignite speculation that some who worked at Stoke Mandeville deliberately overlooked Savile’s sexual abuse of patients because of the money he raised for the hospital. Word for word: This section of the police interview shows how Savile believed victims should be 'brushed away like midges' and added that he 'owned' Stoke Mandeville, where he is known to have abused victims . Explanation: Police asked Savile about his 'policy', which was to make any allegations about his abuse 'disappear' A During the interview, Savile says: ‘I own . this hospital, NHS run it, I own it, and that’s not bad. And one of the . reasons that I get, that I take it seriously is that I wouldn’t let . anything get out of hand to run the risk of spoiling things for my . people here. Savile claimed women flocked to him because of his work on Top Of The Pops and Radio One . ‘Because if I wasn’t here, they wouldn’t get the quarter of a million pound a year they need to keep it going.’ Last year staff at the hospital were accused of a cover-up. Savile also bragged about his charity work at Broadmoor, scene of more of his abuse: ‘I mean for 50 years I’ve had a set of keys at Broadmoor, but I never forget the rules, never forget the rules. You can if you want, but you finish up dead.’ Last night Graham Grant, a former head of Scotland Yard’s paedophile squad, said the Surrey Police interview appeared to have been ‘too informal and ‘lacked rigour’. The ex Met Detective Chief Inspector said of the interviewing officers: ‘Their tone was sympathetic and not challenging enough. I would surmise they were very good when dealing with victims but not the best interviewers when questioning a suspect, particularly such a manipulative one. ‘He was never challenged by any of the questioning and none of his answers probed. ‘The interview was subtly led by him to some extent. He denied any allegation in short sentences but when allowed to give an opinion waxed lyrically and at length over what a good person he was. ‘It is a classic case of minimising any wrong doing. I bet he was polite and probably charming, all part of his manipulation. Kevin Hurley, the Police and Crime Commissioner for Surrey, said that the force he monitors ‘could have done better’ when probing ‘nasty piece of work’ Savile. He said: ‘Surrey Police are right to release these interview transcripts under freedom of information laws.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Retired police officer accused of speaking to Surrey Police in 2009 .

Gary Edgar, 31, died of a heart attack the day after he was twice sent home from A&E with painkillers . A man died of a heart attack hours after twice being sent home from hospital and told to take paracetamol. Gary Edgar, 31, went to an accident and emergency department after suffering severe pains in his arms and chest. His family claim he was sent home by staff at Monklands Hospital in Airdrie, Lanarkshire, and told to take the painkiller. However, the pains got worse and he returned to the hospital three hours later but his family say he was sent away again with same advice. The following day, Ms Edgar was found dead on the floor of the home he shared with two of his brothers in Coatbridge. Now his heartbroken mother Elaine Boyle, 50, has criticised medical staff for not doing more to save her son and called for an investigation into the incident. She said: ‘I’m not happy with how my son was treated and I’m taking this further. ‘I put in a formal complaint against the doctor who sent my son away. ‘I just don’t understand how this was allowed to happen. ‘The hospital should have admitted him to do tests or at least kept him under observation. ‘His heart should have been monitored and because it wasn’t my son is now dead. ‘Surely . someone at the hospital should have thought “this guy’s been up here . already and we sent him home, let’s get him checked out”. ‘Surely when he went up the second time this should have been a cause for concern. ‘There are far too many incidents like this happening and I don’t want them to get away with it. Mr Edgar's mother, Elaine Boyle, said: 'I'm not happy with how my son was treated and I'm taking this further. I put in a formal complaint against the doctor who sent my son away. I just don't understand how this was allowed to happen' ‘Losing my son has been terrible and I don’t want this to happen to another family. ‘This shouldn’t have happened and I want to know why it was allowed to.’ Mother-of-four Ms Boyle told how her son was a fit, healthy young man who was teetotal and would regularly go cycling. Chest pain - usually in the centre of the chest which can feel like pressure or tightness . Pain in the left arm, jaw, neck, back or abdomen . Shortness of breath . Nausea and vomiting . An overwhelming sense of anxiety or panic . Feeling light headed . Coughing or wheezing . She added: ‘I couldn’t believe when I was told Gary had died. ‘He was a fit guy who went to the gym, cycled and took the dog out walking every day.’ Mr Edgar’s brother Colin, 32, who . accompanied him to the hospital and discovered his lifeless body, said a . doctor who saw him blamed the pains on stress. He said: ‘He had already been to the hospital that day but told me it was getting worse so I said we had to go back up. ‘The receptionist obviously realised it was urgent and Gary was seen quickly but the doctor sent him back out within minutes. ‘The doctor said it was nothing and probably caused by stress. ‘Gary couldn’t drive by this time because he had a banging sore head. ‘I had to ask for his blood . pressure to be taken. They said it was slightly high but no cause for . concern and told him to take more paracetamol. ‘The doctor wasn’t for listening and as soon as you raise your voice in a hospital you are arrested these days. A spokesman for Monklands Hospital said: 'We appreciate that this must be a very distressing time. We can confirm that we have been in contact with Ms Boyle and this matter is being dealt with through our formal complaints process' ‘If they had done what they were supposed to do he would still be here today.’ A spokesman for NHS Lanarkshire said: ‘We appreciate that this must be a very distressing time. ‘While we cannot discuss individual cases, we can confirm that we have been in contact with Ms Boyle and this matter is being dealt with through our formal complaints process. ‘We have offered to meet with Ms Boyle to discuss her concerns.’","Gary Edgar visited Monklands Hospital in Lanarkshire with chest pains .

But at home with Danny Fleming, the proud owner of more than 100 sets of bagpipes, his hobby has a less harmonious effect. The Scottish police officer has 40 years of piping experience under his belt, and, unluckily for his wife and nine-year-old son, is as enthusiastic as ever. Enthusiast: Danny Fleming, 50, has amassed 105 sets of bagpipes, believed to be the world's largest collection . At home: Mr Fleming's wife, Jane, has admitted that she would rather her husband were less of a bagpipe fanatic . Mr Fleming, originally of Arbroath on the eastern coast of Scotland, took up the bagpipes aged ten and racked up plenty of experience by serving in the Scots Guards for 24 years. The police officer now plays in Humebrside Police's pipe band, and has established himself as a bagpipe connoisseur with his 105-strong collection. Although the Guinness Book of World Records currently has no entry for the world's biggest bagpipe collection, it is not believed that Mr Fleming's collection has been outdone, and there are plans for him to be recognised in a future edition. His vast, £130,000 collection features models which date from as long ago as 1918, and includes a set of pipes set in gold, silver and ivory worth more than £12,000. All of his pipes also get a good hearing, as Mr Fleming makes sure to swap his current set every few weeks, and undertakes the mammoth task of cleaning his entire collection every three months. Long-suffering: The couple said they have 'understanding neighbours' Proud tradition: Mr Fleming's son Logan, nine, has yet to take up the passion of his father, who was only ten years old when he started playing . Resigned: Mrs Fleming said she 'knew what she was getting into' when she married her husband . Mr Fleming's wife Jan, 41, and . nine-year-old son, Logan, are not great fans of bagpipe music, but have . learned to live with his eccentricity. Mrs Fleming said:  'It is absolutely ridiculous the amount of bagpipes Danny has. He can only play one set at once. 'But I knew when I married him that he came with the bagpipes - I knew what I was getting into. 'We’re lucky we’ve got very understanding neighbours.' Military man: Police officer Mr Fleming used to be a member of the Scots Guards, and even visited the pyramids of Egypt in full regalia, right . Local character: Mr Fleming says he is known as a bagpipe enthusiast in the local community . Dedicated: Mr Fleming has dedicated 40 years of his life to bagpiping . The keen piper, who uses his talent to raise money for Macmillan, Help for Heroes and St Andrews Hospice by playing in charity events, also brought relief to his family by finding a more permanent outlet for his enthusiasm by joining Humberside Police's pipe band. He said: 'Since joining the police band I play at home a lot less, which I think my wife appreciates. 'Jane would relish the thought of me selling them all, but there’s no chance of that happening. I’m too attached to them.' Life's work: Mr Fleming says there is 'no chance' of him ditching the collection, and that whenevr he sells a set of bagpipes he regrets it . Mr Fleming said he became inspired by broadcasts of military processions her watched as a child. He said: 'I saw Trooping the Colour on the television when I was a kid and thought the bagpipes were amazing. 'I started playing for the local band and after six months my dad bought me my first set. 'I have loved and collected bagpipes ever since. 'As a collector and a musician I am always searching for that very special instrument which has an even better sound. Expensive kit: Mr Fleming has spent around £130,000 on his collection, including a single set of pipes, right, which is worth £12,000 . 'Some of my bagpipes I bought new and some are very old, my oldest set are from 1918 and therefore very rare. 'I swap pipes every few weeks, so I get to enjoy playing all of my collection. 'Although they’re all the same size . they all vary in ornamentation and quality of sound, I even have a set . made from plastic rather than wood. 'My most valuable set of bagpipes is . worth over £12,000, it is set in gold and silver with ancient ivory. It . has regimental battle honours engraved and the clan crest. 'I have sold some bagpipes in the past, and I always regret it.' Danny said: 'In the local community people get to hear about things like this, I have become the bagpipe guy and if somebody is selling some, I’m usually the first to hear about it.'","Danny Fleming, 50, owns 105 different sets of bagpipes, worth £130,000 .

The British soldier killed in Afghanistan had been selected for promotion before he was shot dead in Helmand province. Lance Corporal James Brynin, of the Intelligence Corps, was killed when he patrol was attacked in the area of Kakaran, north east of Lashkar Gah, the Ministry of Defence has said. Despite receiving immediate medical attention, 22-year-old L/Cpl Brynin, known as Jay, died from his injuries at the scene. Due for promotion: Lance Corporal James Brynin of the Intelligence Corps had been selected for promotion before he was killed in Afghanistan . His death takes the number of UK service members who have lost their lives since operations in Afghanistan began in October 2001 to 445. It is the first UK death in Afghanistan since Corporal William Savage, Fusilier Samuel Flint, and Private Robert Hetherington died when their Mastiff armoured vehicle hit an improvised explosive device on April 30. Paying tribute to L/Cpl Brynin, the MoD said that he had excelled in the army, had already been selected for promotion to corporal and had 'grand ambitions'. Born in Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex, L/Cpl Brynin joined the army in February 2011. After his initial training he was posted to 14th Signal Regiment (Electronic Warfare) and had already served a tour in Afghanistan in 2012. L/Cpl Bryinon returned to Afghanistan this August as an intelligence analyst working for a light electronic warfare team within the Brigade Reconnaissance Force, BRF, of 7th Armoured Brigade. In the early hours of yesterday, the BRF deployed from Camp Bastion into Nahr-e Saraj in Helmand Province to counter an 'imminent threat' to both Afghans and Isaf, International Security Assistance Force, personnel, the MoD said. Towards the end of the operation, the section came under fire. Together with a sniper and machine-gunner of the BRF, L/Cpl Brynin returned fire but suffered a fatal gunshot wound. Paying tribute to the soldier, L/Cpl Brynin's family said: 'Heart of a lion, we will always stand strong for you. We will never forget. Rest in peace - dad Efrem, mum Sharon, sister Yasmin and girlfriend Olivia.' Tributes also poured in from colleagues, including a poem written by Corporal Ashley Roylance, Intelligence Corps, 236 Signal Squadron, 14th Signal Regiment (Electronic Warfare). The killing of Lance Corporal Brynin in Afghanistan was the first UK death since Fusilier Samuel Flint, Corporal William Savage and Private Robert Hetherington died when their Mastiff vehicle hit an improvised explosive device on April 30 . Comrades described how the Brighton and Hove Albion Football Club fan aspired to 'P Company' - selection for the Parachute Regiment - on his return from Afghanistan. Lieutenant Colonel Mark Purves, Royal Signals, Commanding Officer 14th Signal Regiment (Electronic Warfare), said: 'Bright and engaging, Lance Corporal Brynin was immensely popular and an outstanding soldier in every respect. 'Having already completed one tour to Afghanistan, his appointment to support the Brigade Reconnaissance Force was indicative of his talent and leadership qualities. 'He was fit, determined and genuinely wanted to make a difference. His selection for promotion to full Corporal earlier this year highlighted his flair for his chosen profession.' He went on: 'A member of a small and . specialist cadre, his selfless sacrifice to those around him typifies . his commitment and unflinching bravery. Tribute: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said he was 'saddened' to hear of L/Cpl Brynin's death . 'He will, forever, be remembered with pride by his regimental family. Our thoughts and prayers are with Jay's parents, his close family and friends at this difficult time.' Lieutenant Colonel Richard Slack MBE, Commanding Officer 9th/12th Royal Lancers (Prince of Wales's), the Brigade Reconnaissance Regiment, described L/Cpl Brynin as 'a star, burning bright and rising fast' and a 'truly special individual'. He said: 'His loss is one of the real tragedies of this military campaign.' Major Tom McDermott, Royal Tank Regiment, Officer Commanding the Brigade Reconnaissance Force, also paid tribute to the young soldier. He said: 'Lance Corporal Jay Brynin was one of the great characters of this world. 'From the first moment I met him I was won over by his ever-present smile, his great sense of humour and his ability to get on with everyone and anyone he met. 'He loved his job and the small team he worked with, and they loved him back. 'We will always remember him for his keen intelligence, his determination to succeed, and his zest for life. 'Our deepest condolences are with his parents and his girlfriend.' Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said that he was saddened to learn of the tragic death. 'His colleagues and commanders have spoken warmly about his outstanding professionalism and selflessness,' said Mr Hammond.

Misrepresented: Amanda Knox, pictured in 2011, claims she was not a femme fatale and said she was paying for Italian police errors and original investigators who were too proud to admit they were wrong . Amanda Knox today claimed she was not a femme fatale and said she was paying for Italian police errors and original investigators who were too proud to admit they were wrong. Knox and her Italian boyfriend at the time of the murder, Raffaele Sollecito, were convicted in 2009 of killing 21-year-old Leeds University student Meredith Kercher in what was described as a drug-fueled sexual assault. After winning an appeal in 2011 quashing the guilty verdict, both were freed from prison. But the case is being tried again in Florence after Italy's supreme court overturned the acquittals in March, citing 'contradictions and inconsistencies.' Knox said in an interview due to be aired on Italian state RAI television on Tuesday night the case was taking so long to conclude because of a botched police investigation. 'I think I am paying for the mistakes of the police, of the investigators who don't want to admit that they are wrong,' she said during a prerecorded Skype interview with RAI's Porta a Porta programme. The judge in the case has ordered a new test on the presumed murder weapon, a kitchen knife found in Sollecito's house, to examine a DNA trace that was not previously checked because experts said it was too small to produce reliable results. 'I hope that this new trial will find me innocent and will look at these facts ... let's look at this all in full, but let's find my innocence,' Knox said. Kercher was found with more than 40 wounds, including a deep gash in the throat, in the apartment she shared with Knox in Perugia, a picturesque town in the central Umbria region that attracts students from around the world. Retrial: Knox and her Italian boyfriend at the time of the murder, Raffaele Sollecito, pictured, were convicted in 2009 of killing 21-year-old Leeds University student Meredith Kercher in what was described as a drug-fueled sexual assault . Prosecutors had said that Kercher was held down and stabbed after she resisted attempts by Knox, Sollecito and a third man, Ivorian Rudy Guede, to involve her in an orgy in the apartment the two women shared in the town. However, their case was weakened by forensic experts who undermined the credibility of DNA evidence provided by police and made strong criticisms of their first-response procedures at the scene of the killing. Knox, who was portrayed as a sex-obsessed 'she-devil' by prosecutors, told Porta a Porta she was just a normal person and the image of her they had presented was false. 'I am not the femme fatale criminal fantasy they describe. This person does not exist. They put a mask on me, they put evil on me, but they didn't try to see who I really was,' she said. Knox reaffirmed she would not be returning to Italy to attend the retrial, because she had already been 'wrongfully imprisoned.' Sollecito's father Francesco said his son was planning to be in court at a hearing on November 6.","Spoke in an interview due to be aired on Italian state RAI television on Tuesday night .

"Clayton Moore starred in the 1950s TV show and kept the mask until his death in 1999 . The custom-made prop was one of three . Mask set to fetch £40,000 when it goes on sale in Los Angeles . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:13 EST, 16 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:13 EST, 16 October 2013 . The mask worn by the Lone Ranger is about to go on sale in Los Angeles, and is expected to fetch £40,000 at auction. The custom-made prop was one of three used by actor Clayton Moore, who played the mysterious gunslinger in the 1950s TV show. He kept the mask until his death in 1999 when it was acquired by a private collector. Martin Nolan, from Julien’s Auctions, said: ‘This mask is hugely iconic. It’s a true part of popular culture and we’ve been inundated with enquiries.’ Lone Ranger: Clayton Moore (pictured here with horse Silver) wore the iconic mask from 1949-1952 and 1954-1957 . Moore played The Lone Ranger from 1949 to 1951 when he left the show over a pay dispute. Of the remaining masks, one is in the Smithsonian Institute’s National Museum of American History in Washington D.C. and the other belongs to Moore’s daughter Dawn. Included in the sale is a letter from Dawn written in 2001 explaining the mask’s history. Mr Nolan added: 'This mask was one of three that were custom made for Clayton for comfort and so he could see properly while doing his own stunts. 'This was his favourite out of the three, and the one he wanted to be sold after his death. 'It was auctioned in 2000 and now the vendor, a massive Lone Ranger fan, has decided to let someone else enjoy it. 'The Lone Ranger has a huge cult following and we have been inundated with enquiries about the mask. 'It is a true part of popular culture with worldwide interest.' Favourite: The Lone Ranger's mask will go under the hammer in LA. Clayton Moore said he wanted it auctioned after his death . Hi Ho Silver! The Lone Ranger's tagline was usually followed by someone asking 'who was that masked man anyway?' The Lone Ranger’s tagline was “Hi-Yo, Silver! Away!”, to which someone would ask “Who was that masked man, anyway?” The character’s nickname was because he was the last of the Texas Rangers, rather than because he fought crime alone. In fact, The Lone Ranger was often accompanied by his faithful sidekick Tonto, a Native American who referred to his companion as Kemo Sabe - or ‘trusty scout’. After Moore quit the show he was replaced John Hart but he returned in 1954, playing the lead until it came to an end in 1957. The auction will take place at Julien’s Auctions in Beverly Hills, California, on November 10.","Clayton Moore starred in the 1950s TV show and kept the mask until his death in 1999 .

Under fire: Dr Sunil Kakar, 46, has been temporarily barred from practicing psychology for allowing a prostitute to flee with his laptop containing information on hundreds of patients . A Washington state psychologist has been suspended from practice for allowing a prostitute to take off with his laptop containing sensitive information on his 652 clients. Dr Sunil Kakar, 46, of Gig Harbor, initially told police that his portable computer was stolen from his unlocked car February 4, but he later admitted that a call girl swiped it while he went to take cash out of an ATM. The psychologist allegedly failed to report the theft for four days in violation of his contract with the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services and downpayed the number of patients who could be affected. Police investigators were eventually able to locate the stolen device, The Seattle Times reported. In March, Kakar sent a letter to his clients apologizing for his conduct. 'I am extremely sorry for this situation and understand it may cause concern, embarrassment and inconvenience,' he wrote. 'I try very hard to earn your trust, and that includes protecting sensitive information about you. I take client confidentiality very seriously.' The DSHS said in a press release Monday that Kakar cannot resume his practice until the charges against him are resolved. Collateral: The mental health specialist (center) allegedly left his laptop with the call girl while he went to an ATM to withdraw cash, and when he returned to his car the woman was gone along with his device . Procrastinator: Kakar, who has a teenage daughter (right), did not report the theft to police until 10 days later . The doctor will have an opportunity to present his side of the story during a hearing later this month. He could face a longer license suspension or revocation, as well as a fine of up to $5,000 for each violation. Odd behavior: Kakar got in trouble in 2011 after allegedly stealing food from an inmate at a prison where he worked as a psychologist . The allegations against Kakar stem from an incident that took place February 4 when the 46-year-old newly single doctor left his personal laptop with a hooker as collateral while he went to withdraw money from an ATM. By the time Kakar returned to his car, both the woman and his laptop were gone. According to the Department of Health, Kakar did not contact the agency about his missing laptop holding his patients’ unprotected health information until February 7. The 46-year-old psychologist waited another week before filing a report with police, who were able to track down the stolen laptop to a pawn shop that same day. This is not the first time that Mr Kakar has come under scrutiny over allegations of unprofessional conduct. According to the DSHS, Kakar was involved in a bizarre incident in April 2011 while working as a mental health provider for the Department of Corrections, The News Tribune reported. The doctor allegedly refused to leave an area where an inmate was set to be strip-searched and then stole food from a prisoner. He also allegedly threatened to beat up the boyfriend of another inmate. Later than month, Kakar was admitted into a mental health clinic and was issued a recommendation for a chemical dependency evaluation. Newly single: Dr Kakar, who specializes in depression and traumatic events, split from his wife (left) last year after 12 years of marriage . In July of that year, the psychologist was arrested for DUI and marijuana possession, but pleaded guilty to a downgraded charge of negligent driving. Kakar, a graduate of Loma Linda University in California, was licensed as a psychologist in 2004, specializing in depression, anxiety and traumatic life events like death and divorce. According to his Facebook page, Kakar split from his wife last year after 12 years of marriage, and the couple have a teenage daughter.","Dr Sunil Kakar, 46, is accused of failing to report the February 4 theft to state Department of Health for 4 days .

The case of a 15-year-old girl arrested by police in front of fellow pupils so she could be expelled to Kosovo with her family as illegal immigrants has caused outrage across France. The government, trying to save face, is now investigating the case of Leonarda Dibrani who wants to return to the country, and has described her shame when she was escorted by police from a school bus after a field trip. Immigrants' rights groups and even members of the governing Socialist Party are calling the conditions of the expulsion shocking. Leonarda Dibrani, 15, sits at her home with her family members in the town of Mitrovica in Kosovo earlier today. She was deported after French police hauled her off a bus during a school trip . The teenager's case has angered many French people, who feel her treatment was heavy-handed . The Dibrani family fled Kosovo about five years ago because they are Roma, or Gypsies, and face discrimination and few opportunities, according to activist Jean-Jacques Boy who works with immigrant families in the Doubs region in eastern France, where the family lived. The Interior Ministry said the family's application for asylum had been rejected and it no longer had the right to stay in France. It said they repeatedly refused to leave, so police detained the father and deported him to Kosovo on October 8. They also detained the mother and five of their children, but Leonarda was away on a school field trip. Police met her bus when it returned. The teenager 'was crying, she was upset... she was discouraged' when she got off the bus, Mr Boy said, and teachers and other children were shaken by the incident. Removed: French policemen stand guard as members of the Roma community leave a camp in Roubaix last week . Leonarda, her siblings and mother were sent to Kosovo on October 9. She later described being escorted from the bus. A teacher 'told me to say goodbye to my classmates. I told her it wasn't fair,' she said. Leonarda said her life was now 'a nightmare' and that all she wants is 'to come back to France with my family'. Prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault ordered an investigation into how she was taken into custody and said that if any errors were found, the family will be allowed back to France for further examination. The Education Without Frontiers Network said the expulsion was a setback for their efforts to keep illegal immigrants in school and to protect them from police intervention. It is also an embarrassment for Socialist president Francois Hollande's government, which has portrayed France as a haven for the world's oppressed and distanced itself from his conservative predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy's tough policies toward Roma and other immigrants. PR disaster: The incident has embarassed Francois Hollande's government, which has portrayed France as a haven for the world's oppressed . Thousands of Roma are living in squalor around French cities and are getting involved in a wide range of crimes including armed robbery and aggressive begging. Earlier this month French police began a major crackdown on Roma families and raided gypsy camps around the country, carrying out identity checks. Meanwhile dozens of Roma families took up a French government offer of a free ticket out of the country. Last month Manuel Valls, the Interior Minister, said it was ‘an illusion to think that we can solve the Roma problem through integration.’ Mr Valls wants to do everything possible to keep the Roma out of France, as he associates them with crime and public health problems. His views were supported by a BVA poll which revealed that 77 per cent of French people agreed that Roma were inherently ‘different’. On October 6 Five Eastern Europeans were held in Paris after a £1million jewellery raid by up to 15 men brandishing sledgehammers and axes. Police believe a Roma gipsy gang was behind the well-organised robbery at a Swiss luxury watchmaker’s store in the French capital.","The case of teenager Leonarda Dibrani has shocked French society .

Some people are genetically predisposed to see the world negatively, and to experience emotional events more vividly than others - especially when they are negative . If your glass is always half empty, it could be down to your genes, according to scientists. Some people are genetically predisposed to see the world negatively, and to experience emotional events more vividly than others - especially when they are negative. The gene, called the ADRA2b deletion variant, plays a role in how the hormone and neurotransmitter norepinephrine functions. The variant was previously known to affect how the brain forms emotional memories. Researchers say the new study shows that the ADRA2b deletion variant also influences the way people see the world in real-time, leading some to see things negatively through ‘gene-coloured glasses’. Neuroscientist Professor Rebecca Todd explained: ‘This is the first study to find that this genetic variation can significantly affect how people see and experience the world. ‘We found that some individuals are predisposed to see the world more darkly than others. ‘A previously known genetic variation causes some individuals to perceive the world more vividly than others - and particularly negative aspects of the world. ‘This is important because our findings shed new light on the way that genes, along with other factors such as cultural differences or life experiences, can influence individual differences in emotional perception. ‘For example, people who have this variation might look out at a crowd of people and only see angry faces. ‘Or they may be in an outdoor scene and see potential hazards - rocks where you might slip - instead of seeing the natural beauty. ‘So we’ve all heard the expression “seeing the world through rose-coloured glasses”. ‘Well, this is like seeing the world through gene-coloured glasses tinted a bit darkly.’ Professor Todd and her team at the University of British Columbia ran an experiment on 200 volunteers who were tested for the ADRA2b gene variant before taking a visual emotional test. A gene, the ADRA2b deletion variant, impacts the way people see the world, leading some to see things negatively through 'gene-coloured glasses' Each was shown positive, negative and neutral words in quick succession and asked how their mood was affected. The team’s results, published in Psychological Science, showed people with the varied gene were more likely to perceive words as being negative than others, while both sets of people with and without the variation equally saw positive word as better than neutral words. Professor Todd said: ‘The findings suggest people experience emotional aspects of the world partly through gene-coloured glasses - and that biological variations at the genetic level can play a significant role in individual differences in perception,’ adding that the discovery shows how genes can affect ‘differences in emotional perception and human subjectivity’.","A gene, the ADRA2b deletion variant, impacts the way people see the world, leading some to see things negatively through ‘gene-coloured glasses’

A Frenchman who lived in a Paris apartment which was the size of a toilet for 15 years, is suing his former landlord for €25,000, it has been revealed. The 50-year-old tenant, known only as Dominique, will appear in court on Tuesday to pursue the owner of his former flat for rent reimbursements and damages after he discovered the property was let to him illegally. Under French law, an apartment must have at least 9 square metres of living space to be put up for rent. Illegal: Under French law, a property must have at least nine square metres of liveable space but Dominique's flat had just 1.56 metres of habitable room (stock picture) But Dominique's flat on the 11th floor of a block in the French capital had just 1.56 square metres of liveable room. By the end of his tenancy in Janary this year he was paying €330 a month in rent, which works out as €211 per month per liveable square metre. The only furniture or appliances Dominique could fit into the hovel was a mattress, sink and humble hob for cooking. Speaking to French publication 20 Minutes, Dominique's lawyer Aurelie Geoffroy confirmed the legal action would be going ahead. Mr Geoffroy said: 'The money entails rent repayment from the last five years, as well as moral harm suffered by my client. The tenant’s case was championed by French housing charity the Fondation Abbé Pierre. They are campaigning  to highlight the number of tiny apartments being illegally let to desperate tenants in Paris. In demand: Living space is so sought after in Paris, above, that tiny rooms are being let illegally for huge rent . Samuel Mouchard from the charity, said: 'When I first saw the apartment, I asked myself ""how is this possible"" 'Until then the smallest flat I’d ever seen was three square metres, but Dominique broke that sad record' Speaking after the initial discovery of Dominique's situation in January, Mouchard said: 'Some landlords are unscrupulous. The law is there but it needs to be enforced. 'Tenants need to know that it’s forbidden. If they have doubts they can go to their local Town Hall where measures can be taken to protect them or to rehouse them.'","Flat was too small to be let under French housing law .

A farmer who found oil bubbling up onto his land is not about to reap a windfall from the shock discovery - because the crude comes not from an undiscovered deposit, but from a burst pipeline. Steve Jensen owns the farm in North Dakota which last month became the site of the largest oil spill ever to take place on land in the U.S. He now fears his land will not be fertile for years to come, and could claim thousands of dollars in compensation from the company whose pipeline runs beneath the farm near the remote town of Tioga. Record: 20,000 barrels of crude oil have spilled from a pipeline running through North Dakota . Damage: The spill is set to make the farmland unusable for two or three years, according to Mr Jensen . Mr Jensen's discovery has been compared to The Beverly Hillbillies, the classic sitcom in which farmer Jed Clampett strikes it rich by finding oil on his land. However, rather than profiting Mr Jensen is set to lose out, as he quickly realised that the crude oil he could see was in fact from a pipeline which runs from the Bakken rock formation to a nearby freight railway hub. He found the oil on September 29 when he was harvesting wheat and saw black liquid standing six inches deep in his fields. The oil came from a 'perfectly round, quarter-inch hole' producing 'about 100 pounds pressure', Mr Jensen told FoxNews.com. Discovery: The spill was found by farmer Steve Jensen as he was harvesting wheat on his land near Tioga . Work: Vehicles cleaning up the damage from the spill on Mr Jensen's farm . It soon emerged that the pipe, owned by Tesoro Logistics, had spewed out a total of 20,600 barrels of oil, apparently the biggest spill on land in American history. The spill covered an area of land the size of seven football fields, and produced enough oil to fill three Olympic-sized swimming pools. Mr Jensen says it has ruined much of his land, affecting his livelihood for several years, and he will not be able to sell grain for human consumption if it has been grown within half a mile of the spill. 'I'm not going to be able to farm that land for a few years and there'll be compensation for sure,' he said. 'That is going to come later. We're looking at a two- to three-year cleanup.'

'As long as we let oil companies keep us locked into these forms of extreme fossil fuels, we'll continue to see spills like these,' Greenpeace's Phil Radford told FoxNews.com. Mr Jensen said that the amount of oil released into the soil would be 'pretty detrimental to any living organism that's in the ground'. The pipeline has been shut down by Tesoro while the oil is cleaned from the surrounding area, with the spill expected to cost the firm nearly $2million. However, experts this week questioned the company's estimate of how much oil leaked from the pipelines, saying it was 'at best a guess'. An engineer who helped measure the amount of oil spilt in the Gulf by the broken BP well Deepwater Horizon said that the estimate by Tesoro did not appear to be backed up by any scientific studies.","Steve Jensen found oil on his South Dakota farm while harvesting wheat .

All grandparents dream of greatness for their grandchildren - but one man's bet that his baby grandson would one day play international football has paid off in spectacular style. When sixteen-year-old Welshman Harry Wilson ran out on to the pitch against Belgium last night for his national side, he made history as the youngest-ever player for Wales. But he also made his grandfather £125,000, and an early retirement, after Peter Edwards, 62, bet £50 in 2000 that his grandson, aged just 18 months, would one day represent his country. Long-shot: Peter Edwards won £125,000 on odds of 2,500-1 when his son played his first game for Wales . The odds of 2,500-1 did nothing to stop Mr Edwards making the confident bet, and last night's appearance as a substitute confirmed his excellent talent-spotting abilities. Mr Wilson, who plays in Liverpool FC's under-18s squad, came on in the 87th minute last night before the game concluded as a 1-1 draw between the Welsh and Belgian teams. Mr Edwards, who services electrical cables for a living, said he retired immediately when his grandson took to the field, while he watched the game on his iPad from his caravan in Buckingham. He works away from his home in Corwen, North Wales, most of the year and sees his wife Dorothy, 58, just once a fortnight. But he was able to retire early thanks to his winnings, which he says will be used in part to support Mr Wilson's development as a professional footballer. He said today: 'I've retired one year early. I have come home now and will not be going back. Not bad for a daft bet. Record player: Mr Wilson is Wales' youngest-ever national player, beating the record previously held by Gareth Bale . 'I retired immediately. I told my manager yesterday that if Harry plays I wouldn't be coming back.' He said he put on the original bet on a whim after seeing how Harry liked playing with a football even as a toddler. 'He used to chase the ball around the front room on his hands and knees even before he could walk, that's what gave me the idea. But I hoped the bet would come up.' Young talent: Mr Wilson can be seen being prepped for action by Wales manager Chris Coleman last night . Mr Wilson plays on the left wing, the same as Gareth Bale, the Real Madrid superstar whose record as the youngest Welsh player he beat last night aged just 16 years 207 days, compared to Mr Bale's 16 years 315 days. Dorothy Edwards said: 'It was a historic moment and very a proud one for the whole family. 'We're delighted for Harry and of course Peter's bet makes it all the better - we had the champagne out last night. 'We all knew Harry would make it one day but no one expected it was going to be quite this soon. Warming the bench: Mr Wilson, right, came on as a substitute in the 87th minute. He had previously sat out a game against Macedonia. 'It's great that he's broken the record set by Gareth Bale - they are some really big boots to fill. 'He's such a talented boy - he was kicking a football as soon as he was standing up. 'My husband always enjoyed a flutter on the horses and on the football . and one day he just decided he was going to place the bet. 'It's something which has really paid off now.' Mr Edwards also revealed that he tried to make a second bet on Harry's prospects at the William Hill shop in Wrexham, but was politely refused in light on Harry's more obvious talents. He said: 'Harry was about 12 then. But they turned me down and said I already had a substantial bet with them. But they threw in England as a gesture of goodwill.' It meant even if the teenager had opted to play for England, something he could have done because his grandmother was born in Chester, the pay-out would have been safe. Mr Edwards said: 'This means I will be able to help Harry out. You can be quite sure that he will get a share of it.' A William Hill spokesman said: 'Peter has been able to quit his job as a result of his amazing ability to spot fledgling talent earlier than almost anyone else we've ever taken a bet from.'","Peter Edwards, 62, made the 2,500-1 bet when his grandson was a baby .

The Metropolitan Police team is trying to identify fair-haired men - who may be Dutch or German  - who were seen lurking near the apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, where the girl was snatched from. The new calls will raise hopes that police can make a breakthrough in the hunt for Madeleine who vanished on May 3, 2007. Scroll down for video . Wanted: E-fits of fair-haired men who may be Dutch or Scandinavian who were seen lurking near the apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, which Madeleine McCann was snatched from. Police launched an appeal on Dutch television last night. Detectives believe they could be the same person . Dutch appeal: Chief Inspector Andy Redwood calls on Dutch viewers to report themselves if they were in the area at the time of the girl's disappearance in 2007, during a broadcast of Opsporing Verzocht on Dutch television . Breakthrough? Police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann received 150 calls from Holland after a TV broadcast there last night . Her parents Kate and Gerry said they are . 'genuinely hopefully' that police can make progress in the . investigation after a special BBC Crimewatch broadcast. During . the show, two new e-fits of a man were broadcast, while police said . they had effectively ruled out a previous key sighting of a different . man carrying a little girl - suggesting Madeleine may have been taken . later than previously thought. Detectives want to trace two unidentified men – with blonde or fair hair and possibly German or Scandinavian – who were seen in the vicinity of Ocean Club. Based on several sightings, they issued two e-fits which ‘may or may not be the same person’. One is of a thin white man, aged 30-35, with spots on his face possibly caused by shaving. On both occasions he had black sunglasses with a thick frame and was wearing a black leather jacket. The second e-fit, based on a description by a different witness, was again near the McCanns’ holiday apartment. An appeal was shown last night in Holland on a programme called Opsporing Verzocht, and will feature on the German programme Aktenzeichen XY...ungelost tonight. Fresh calls from the Netherlands come after Scotland Yard received 730 calls and 212 emails in the biggest ever response to a Crimewatch appeal. Detectives . believe a sighting of a man carrying a blonde girl 500 yards from the . McCanns’ holiday apartment is of ‘vital importance’. But . the account of Irish holidaymakers who saw the suspect has been called . into question because they originally said they were ‘60 to 80 per cent . sure’ it was Madeleine’s father Gerry. Police have however said they are certain Mr McCann is not involved. Martin and Mary Smith gave police a signed statement when they returned home to Drogheda, County Louth. Prime suspect: These e-fits are of the man seen carrying a child 500 . yards from the McCanns' holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal . Response: After the couple's appeal on BBC Crimewatch(pictured), a number of callers gave names for the man police believe snatched Madeleine . Search: Madeleine's mother said she was 'genuinely hopeful' of a breakthrough . New timeline: The Crimewatch special revealed that police were now looking at Madeleine's abduction as being at 10pm and not 9.15pm . They said they had seen a man carrying a child toward Praia da Luz’s beach at 10pm on the night Madeleine, then aged three, disappeared. Metodo 3, a detective agency hired by the McCanns, produced two e-fits of the man in 2008 based on the Smiths’ account. Crimewatch's Madeline McCann . special was the most watched edition of the BBC show in its 29 year . history, attracting more than seven million viewers. The . hour long programme, which saw Scotland Yard reveal new findings, . peaked with 7.3 million, 30 per cent of the total audience share in the . five minutes from 9.25pm. The . show had an average of 6.7 million viewers, 27.4 per cent of the share, . adding almost three million viewers to the channel's slot average of . 3.9 million, nearly half the audience share enjoyed on Monday. A BBC spokeswoman said: 'It is the highest audience for a Crimewatch programme on record, going back to 2002.' The BBC does not have audience figures for Crimewatch, pre-dating that. It was first broadcast in 1984. Monday . night's Crimewatch was up against the popular ITV series Doc Marten . which drew an average audience of seven million. The previous series . high on March 31st, 2008, recorded 5.5 million (24 per cent). The ten . minute update at 10:35pm also attracted 3.3 million (22.5 per cent). BBC . head of communications Sam Hodges, responding to a criticism on Twitter . it was a 'ghastly ratings chaser', suggested the big audience was 'a . reflection of the public interest'. The images were made public this week when Scotland Yard revealed the mystery man is now the prime suspect. The detective leading the Metropolitan Police investigation is expected to travel to Ireland in the coming weeks. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood said he was extremely pleased with the response to Monday night’s Crimewatch appeal. ‘We have now had over 730 calls and 212 emails as a direct result of the specific lines of inquiry we issued concerning events in the lead up to, and on the night of Thursday 3rd May 2007 when Madeleine was abducted,’ he said. ‘Detectives are now trawling through and prioritising that material. This will take time.’ Mr Redwood, who insists Mr McCann had nothing to do with his daughter’s disappearance, said two independent callers had put forward the same name for the suspect. Another caller gave the name of a man who was known to be in Portugal at the time of Madeleine’s disappearance. Mr Redwood said officers were waiting to ‘action the information’ and 40 people were ready to take further calls. With 6.7million viewers, the appeal attracted the biggest Crimewatch audience on record – almost double the average of 3.9 million. A BBC spokesman said it also had the highest number of calls ever received, more than double the usual number. The programme’s editor Joe Mather said: ‘Significantly, there were lots of calls from British people who were in Praia da Luz around the time of Madeleine’s disappearance who had never previously spoken to the Met, so there’s lots of information coming through there. ‘They received several names for the key 10pm sighting, the sighting of a man carrying a child toward the beach. ‘Several different names but also several callers mentioned the same name for that man.’ Chilling: A scene from the Crimewatch reconstruction showing the moment Kate McCann discovers her daughter's empty bed .

The inquest at Oxford Coroner's Court heard today that the explosion turned the vehicle upside down and blew off its gun turret. Ammunition on board the . vehicle ignited, causing a fierce fire. The Warrior, known by the callsign . K12, was patrolling with another vehicle about 25 miles north of Lashkar Gah when the explosion happened on March 6 last year. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack which was the single deadliest strike on British forces in Afghanistan since 2001. After the explosion, soldiers in a second Warrior vehicle reported hearing an explosion and then seeing a 'fireball' as it ignited. In a statement read to the court, . Private Luke Stones, of 3 YORKS, described how Pte Kershaw - who was . driving the Warrior - had volunteered to take the place of another . soldier on the patrol.

Grief: Monica Kershaw holds a picture of her son Christopher who died after taking the place of one of his army colleagues at the last moment . He stood up immediately to see what had happened. 'There was a large fireball which had flames reaching about 100ft high,' he said. 'I stood staring at the fireball, not really understanding what I was looking at. 'The turret was on fire as well, . burning independently. The flames were too intense to see which position . the vehicle had come to rest in. 'I heard a series of explosions coming from the destroyed Warrior.' The inquest heard that all six . men died of blast injuries caused by the explosion. As they cleared a safe path to the .

'It was apparent that anyone involved in the explosion could not have survived the blast.' Grief: Hearses carrying the six bodies are driven through Carterton, Oxfordshire, in March last year after the men were repatriated to the UK .

The wife of a fugitive crime lord who owned so many sports cars he was nicknamed 'Don Car-leone' has insisted that her husband does not give her money - even though she spends £17,000 a month. Jasbiner Boparan, a former personal assistant, is fighting to stop her assets being frozen by officials who claim they are the proceeds of her husband Michael's crimes. He is living in Dubai and is wanted by French police for allegedly running a Europe-wide criminal gang. After he was arrested in 2010, detectives in Britain and Switzerland seized £4million worth of supercars from his collection, including two Bugatti Veyrons, four Ferraris, three Rolls-Royces and two Porsches. They found one Rolls-Royce dumped in a carpark at Stansted airport, while other vehicles owned by Boparan, 47, contained £750,000 in cash. The gang lord, also known as Alexander Surin, bragged about his collection on forums like Pistonheads and Ferrari Chat using the screen name 'Icemanbops'. Ever since going on the run, he has apparently been living in Dubai's exclusive Emirate Hills gated community, where rents start at £1,500 per month and houses can cost as much as £7million. Mrs Boparan appeared at the High Court yesterday to defend herself against the National Crime Agency, which is attempting to freeze her assets. She says she is living in 'very difficult times' despite spending £17,000 per month and living in a street in St John's Wood, North-West London, where properties cost an average of £1.5million. She told the court her lifestyle was financed by her brother, who owns a hotel in Canada, and said she had not received financing from her husband either directly or 'through third parties'. The NCA claims that Mrs Boparan 'is in fact the joint recipient of the proceeds of unlawful conduct, mainly of her husband'. Jonathan Hall, acting for the agency, . asked her if she was aware her husband had secured loans against the . properties in question. 'I think that is for him to answer,' she said. 'No, I did not know. I would have been absolutely furious.' Car: One of the many expensive vehicles with a personalised numberplate owned by Michael Boparan . Michael Boparan apparently lives in Dubai's exclusive Emirate Hills, where rents start at £1,500 per month . Mrs Boparan said that she owed £130,000 to her family after borrowing from them to keep up with her spending. 'It is all a bit convenient for you', Mr Hall said. 'You claim you have no assets but when push comes to shove the assets are made available to you.' He suggested that her funds all came from her husband but had been 'disguised in some way', which she denied. Judge Higgins indicated he will reserve judgement to a later date. Denial: Mrs Boparan says she is financed by her brother and owes £130,000 to family members . Mr Boparan was jailed for five years in 1996 over a £1.3million bank swindle after he and his gang forged bank cards and plundered more than 800 accounts, spending the proceeds on fast cars, expensive holidays and hostess bars. He was later found guilty of involvement in a huge customs fraud, but the conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal thanks to errors by the prosecution. At the time, Lord Justice Longmore said, 'This is a melancholy result. The court is compelled to allow the appeals, even in the case of one man who pleaded guilty.' Judge Higgins has indicated he will reserve judgement to a later date.","Michael Boparan built huge collection of luxury cars thanks to bank scam .

The small-town prosecutor who sparked a national firestorm by dismissing rape charges against two popular athletes in Maryville, Missouri, is reopening the case and asking for a special investigator to review the evidence again. Robert Rice, who has been widely criticized for dismissing charges in the alleged sexual assault of Daisy Coleman and Paige Parkhurst, announced Wednesday that he would ask for a new prosecutor to re-examine the case. The national spotlight appears to be taking its toll on the city of 12,000. At the end of the prosecutor's news conference, a woman claiming to be the mother of one of the suspects - Matthew Barnett - grabbed the microphone and said threats against her son and her family 'must stop.' Rice also vehemently denied that small-town politics influenced his initial handling of the case. Barnett is from a prominent family in Maryville and his grandfather was a longtime State Representative. Victim: Daisy Coleman (right) was found by her mother Melinda (left) after she was allegedly raped by a boy from her high school. Charges against him were dropped . Renewed questions: Missouri's lieutenant governor has called for a grand jury to review the case after sexual assault charges were dropped against Matthew Barnett, sparking online furore . Daisy and Paige, who have both spoken out publicly, were just 14 and 13 in January 2012 when they sneaked out of Daisy's house to attend a party with several older athletes from Maryville High School. The teens allege they were both heavily intoxicated when Barnett, then 17, had sex with Daisy while she was passed out. They then allegedly dumped Daisy, who was passed out drunk, on her front porch in 22-degree weather. Barnett, a friend who allegedly recorded the sexual encounter, and a 15-year-old boy were all arrested in the case. Rice dropped all charges just a few weeks later, citing a lack of evidence. Barnett, now a student at Southern Missouri State University, acknowledges that he had sex with the 14-year-old, but maintains it was consensual. The Colemans, who were outsiders in tight-knit Maryville, say they suffered constant threats and Daisy was subjected to relentless cyber-bully. Mrs Coleman said she had no choice by the flee town. Months after moving away from Maryville, their house - which was for sale - burned down. The cause of the fire remains 'undetermined,' but Mrs Coleman is suspicious that it could be connect the the rape case. The charred remains of the fire-damaged home of Melinda Coleman and her children earlier this month. The cause of the fire could not be determined . On Wednesday, following heavy pressure from the national news media - as well as Missouri's Lieutenant Governor - Rice re-opened the case. Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder had earlier today released a statement saying that recent reports of the alleged sexual assault 'raise all kinds of questions that it is now clear won’t be put to rest.' Rice said he would ask the county's chief judge to appoint a special prosecutor to look into the case. The prosecutor would be from outside the county and would, in theory at least, be free from the perception of local biases. Rice claimed that recent media interviews showed that the Coleman family now wants to cooperate with the investigation. Mrs Coleman denies claims that she didn't cooperate fully with investigators. Barnett, 19, was initially charged with sexual assault and endangering a child's welfare as one of three teenagers who took part in a night of alleged assaults. Barnett's friend was charged with recording at least a part of the incident on an iPhone. Two months later, all charges were dropped in a case that has sparked online protests and widespread outrage. A second girl, identified only as Paige came forward with her mother to say that she was identified on the same night as Daisy by another high school football player . In a public statement, Mr Kinder . said on Wednesday: 'Since Sunday I have read with growing dismay the . media accounts of the Daisy Coleman case in Nodaway County. 'I . make no claim to knowledge of all the facts. Still, facts revealed in . exhaustive media reports, including the 4,000-word piece in the Kansas . City Star, raise all kinds of questions that it is now clear won’t be . put to rest. 'These questions will fester and taint the reputation of our state for delivering impartial justice to all.' He added: 'I . hope that responsible officials will join me in this call for a grand . jury to make the final call on whether criminal charges should or should . not be filed.' A spokeswoman for Missouri's attorney general said her office cannot reopen the case. A former attorney for Barnett also released a statement on Wednesday claiming that the charges against his client were dropped after the girl and her family refused to cooperate in the investigation. Missouri Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder called for a grand jury to review the alleged rape case of Maryville teenager Daisy Coleman . Attorney Robert Sundell says Daisy Coleman and her mother Melinda refused to answer questions during a May 2012 deposition and later offered inconsistencies in another deposition. Sundell said the boy cooperated with investigators and 'freely admitted' to the sexual encounter. The attorney said while the boy's behavior might be reprehensible, it was not necessarily criminal. The mother denies she and her daughter were uncooperative. Mrs Coleman told CNN: 'I told them everything. 'That's absolutely not . true, and it still kind of shocks me that they're lying about it.' Mrs Coleman and her four children had moved from Albany, New York to Maryville, Missouri for a fresh start after her doctor husband was killed in a car crash. Following the alleged rape, Daisy was targeted by cyber-bullies, began self-harming and attempted suicide. Mrs Coleman lost her job as a veterinarian as her employer is a friend of the Barnett family - who carry considerable political weight in the small town. Matthew Barnett's grandfather Rex is a former state representative. The Coleman family have since left town following the ostracization and threats they have received since the incident. In April, the Colemans' Maryville home -- . which had been vacant and for sale -- burned to the ground. An examination could not be conducted due to the 'unsafe nature of the structure'. Maryville city and school officials reported on Wednesday they are on heightened alert in response to negative attention the city is receiving over a sexual abuse case.. Friends: Paige, pictured right, with Daisy, said that she remembers the night of the attack that she and her school friend were allegedly sexually assaulted . City, school and police officials say . they are concerned about reaction expressed on social media and in . phone calls after the Nodaway County prosecutor decided to drop the . sexual assault charges last year. On . Monday, the activist group Anonymous released an online statement . criticizing the city and police for not prosecuting the case. However, . the case was handled by Nodaway County, not the city. The . Maryville Daily Forum reports police are increasing patrols to protect . anyone involved with the case and school officials met on Monday at all . three city schools to discuss security. Daisy's friend Paige, who was at her . house for a sleepover, came forward on Tuesday to reveal that she was also raped . while her friend was being attacked in a nearby room. Paige did not name her 15-year-old attacker but said that unlike Daisy, she remembers all of the details of the attack. Her case was settled in juvenile court. She . told CNN: 'After he was done and we went out to the living room we . waited for Matt to come out with Daisy and he opened the door and I saw .

Kicked out: University of Oklahoma wide receiver Trey Metoyer has been charged with two counts of indecent exposure and suspended indefinitely from the team after two separate incidents . University of Oklahoma wide receiver Trey Metoyer has been charged with two counts of indecent exposure and suspended indefinitely from the team after getting caught masturbating in public. Cleveland County prosecutors filed the charges Tuesday against Metoyer, 20, a sophomore who is accused of exposing himself to two women in Norman, according to an affidavit filed in the case. Coach Bob Stoops said Metoyer has not been with the 18th-ranked Sooners since before its game against TCU October 5. He then added, ‘I do not anticipate that he will return to the team in the future.’ According to the affidavit, the first incident occurred August 29. The victim told a Norman police detective she was smoking on a balcony when she spotted a Grand Am driven by a man in the apartment building's parking lot. The car ‘pulled into a parking spot’ and the woman noticed that the man was touching his exposed genitals while sitting in the car. The second incident took place September 17 when Metoyer allegedly approached a woman walking her dog and asked her if he could borrow a pen. She went into her apartment to get an ink pen and when she came back, Metoyer was masturbating, it says. Full frontal: According to two women, Metoyer (No. 17) was caught in August and September pleasuring himself outdoors in full view of passersby . The 20-year-old ‘then asked the victim if she would want the pen back,’ the affidavit states. Earlier this month, the second victim picked Metoyer out of a photo lineup as the man who had exposed himself to her, according to NewsOK. When questioned by police, the sophomore initially denied the allegations. He later acknowledged them and told police ‘that the incidents were a mistake and he was not thinking clearly at the time.’ Receivers coach Jay Norvell said earlier this month that Metoyer was 'going through some things right now.' 'He's trying to get his hands around it. And so we just wish him the best as he works his way through that,' he told the site SoonerScoop October 1.

Convicted: Brendan Harris, pictured at 15, has been given four months on top of his life sentence after assaulting a nurse at a psychiatric unit . A notorious killer serving life for murdering teenager Sophie Lancaster has been jailed for a further four months after he punched a nurse in a secure psychiatric unit. Brendan Harris, 21, threatened to kill one member of staff after he . became angry over a fellow inmate being restrained. He also punched another in the face leaving him with a broken nose. Preston Crown Court was told the assault . on nurse David Timson occurred on January 10 after Harris was diagnosed . with paranoid schizophrenia and transferred from a young offender . institution to the Guild Lodge, Whittingham, Lancashire. Harris was given a further four months on top of his life sentence after he was convicted of wounding. Harris was only 15 when he battered to death the 18-year-old gap year student Sophie Lancaster in 2007, simply because of the alternative clothes she was wearing. Miss Lancaster died as she tried to protect . her then boyfriend Robert Maltby, 21, as they walked through Stubbylee . Park in Bacup, Lancashire. Harris and friend Ryan Herbert, then 16, had just a month earlier been found . guilty of affray over a similar attack on another boy close to the same . park. They walked free from court with community service . orders. Both youngsters . had drunk at least four pints of strong cider and downed shots of . schnapps when they and their five man gang ambushed Miss Lancaster and Mr Maltby in . August 2007. Initially . Sophie handed out cigarettes to placate the yobs but they suddenly . turned on Mr Maltby, a university art student. One of the gang was heard . to shout 'let’s bang him,' before Harris attacked Mr Maltby with a flying kick to the head. Miss . Lancaster, who was due to start an English degree at university a month . later, cradled her boyfriend’s head in her lap and begged his laughing . attackers to leave him alone after they battered him unconscious. Attack: Harris was in a fit of rage when he attacked a nurse and broke their nose at Guild Lodge psychiatric unit . But . instead the group, 'acting like a pack of wild animals', ignored her . pleas. Instead, Herbert and Harris began 'savagely and mercilessly' raining . down blows on her head 'as though it was a football' until she fell into . a coma. The youths then left the couple for dead, . before boasting to friends: 'We’ve just beaten someone up. There’s two . moshers nearly dead up Bacup Park. You wanna see them, they’re a right . mess.' One 14-year-old . girl, who witnessed the attack, dialled 999 in an effort to get help. Her hysterical call was played to the jury during the trial. When . paramedics arrived they found the couple lying side by side covered in . blood. Their injuries were so severe they were unable to establish . whether the victims were male or female. The . couple, who had been together for six months but had already talked . about getting married, were both taken to hospital in comas. Senseless: Goth Sophie Lancaster, then 18, was beaten to death by Harris and his gang in 2007 . Although . Mr Maltby survived, he has suffered lasting injuries and has virtually . no memory of the attack. Miss Lancaster never regained consciousness and . died 13 days later. Harris later claimed to police he punched Mr Maltby because he was 'drunk and showing off'. He was later jailed for . life with a recommendation he serve 17 years after a judge described . Sophie’s killing as an act of ‘feral thuggery.' During the latest trial, held last month, Harris’s murder conviction was kept a secret from the jury for legal reasons. The . panel was given only brief details of Harris’s criminal past - being . told of a GBH conviction “dating back to August 2007” which unbeknown to . them related to the assault on Mr Maltby. But . upon delivering the guilty verdict Judge Christopher Cornwall then . revealed to the horrified members of the jury details of Harris’s attack . on Sophie and admitting he was 'no ordinary patient in a psychiatric . unit.' Horrific: Sophie Lancaster in hospital following Harris' 'savage and merciless' attack . Today Harris appeared by video link wearing a black long sleeved Tshirt with a shaved head and showed no emotion as Judge Cornwall sentenced him for wounding the nurse. Judge Cornwall said: 'Another patient behaved badly and had to be restrained and put in the seclusion room immediately adjacent to your room. because the staff did not like the patients gathering round when someone has to be restrained you were asked not to approach your room. 'Although you complied with it when a member of staff came to speak you rebuked him for the way he looked at you and started to verbally abuse him and make repeated threats to kill him. You were left on your own to calm down. 'Matters went from bad to worse and other members of staff become involved to try and persuade you to move from where you were standing. There was no alternative but to physically restrain you as a last resort and with great reluctance. Life sentence: Harris' accomplice Ryan Herbert, pictured at 16, was also jailed for life . 'Staff continue to try and persuade you to do what they wanted you to do, to withdraw threats made, but without success. for a good half hour staff members were exclusively involved in trying to persuade you to cooperate. 'It was utterly clear you had not the slightest intention of cooperating. Staff were prevented of making their quarter hourly checks on other patients to ensure their wellbeing. 'They exhausted every possibility and an arrowhead formation was formed. David Timson approached you with raised hands in a gesture made to reassure you. You knew what was going to happen, you had given your understanding to this handling. 'They behaved entirely properly and in accordance with methods but all to no avail. David Timson advanced and you struck a single blow, a very substantial blow that fractured his nose. It was a painful and unpleasant injury but could not be said to be serious in the context of a really serious injury.” 'The violence used against David Timson was unlawful violence and the court has a clear public duty as well as to other patients who may think that they have little to lose by behaving badly. 'Staff who care for you are often at some risk themselves of being attacked. It is important for you to understand they exercise the very greatest patience and restraint and are wholly conscious of difficulties you suffer from but you cannot be permitted to use unlawful violence against them and expect that to have no consequences.'","Brendan Harris, 21, threatened to kill one member of staff before breaking nurse David Timson's nose at Guild Lodge unit in Lancashire .

Delaware has announced it has its first confirmed Obamacare enrollee on Tuesday, over two weeks after the program’s roll-out. Department of Health and Social Service officials have declared Janice Baker, 59, of Selbyville the first confirmed resident to enroll in the marketplace. Baker says she faced challenges along the way and even spent seven hours on the computer and phone, but she’s confident it was all well worth it. She's number one: Selbyville, Delaware dog kennel owner Janice Baker (right) was announced Tuesday as the state's very first confirmed Obamacare enrollee. At left is Delaware HHS Secretary Rita Landgraf . ‘I started looking right at October 1,’ Baker, who runs a dog kennel, told the News Journal. That’s when Obamacare marketplaces opened across the country. It’s also when potential enrollees nationwide began experiencing system glitches, both online and on the phone. ‘I had made several attempts online to enroll and activate my membership,’ Baker said. ‘I could not get in to save my life.’ More affordable: Baker, right, will pay $700 a month for her new insurance plan, saving her around $1800 per year . She then called an 800 number, but after an hour and a half the representative’s computer locked up. When she called again, the same thing happened. Days later, after Baker followed a tip found on the healthcare.gov site suggesting users clear their computers’ browsing history, cookies and other temporary data, she was able to complete the process. ‘Right after that, I was able to apply,’ Baker said. ‘It might not be the government computers, it may be your own sitting in front of you.’ Baker told the News Journal she's grateful for her new insurance plan after having been turned down several companies due to a pre-existing condition. 'I was thrilled to be able to have this happen,' she said. 'This is so much better than the policy before. I was very impressed.' Though she declined to go into detail about the plan she chose, Baker said she'll now be paying $700 per month for her health insurance. While acknowledging the system’s problems, secretary of the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services Rita Landgraf said that many of the glitches have been fixed and that the process is becoming smoother. Delaware made headlines last week as reports emerged that the state had yet to log a single enrollee. Baker has now changed that. ‘My thought is now that we have Janice, we’re going to see more and more people successfully getting through the screens and getting through the enrollment,’ said Landgraf.

The artist's grandson, Olivier Picasso, and French journalist Péri Cochin came up with the idea of raffling the masterpiece. Olivier . Picasso said: 'This is a very important drawing because it first stands . witness on the Cubist work carried out by my grandfather.' He added: 'Everything innovative . would interest him, I think that Pablo Picasso was a pioneer, pioneer in . his personal life, in his sentimental life, in his creation. 'He’s also a pioneer in all this forms of creations, painting, drawing, sculpture, ceramics, show, and I think he would have been amused to be involved in such an operation, a popular operation.' London's Pavilion of Art and Design will house the work from today until October 20. The drawing, which measures 30.5cm by 24cm, was bought by the charity from a gallery in New York, according to the Financial Times. Ms Cochin said: 'I always helped this association because my mother is Lebanese and we were used to raising funds by making gala dinners where the guests had nothing to say, are bored and can’t wait to come back home quickly. 'We had tried to find an alternative to raise funds and we start this innovative adventure, an international lottery on a charity purpose with a chance to win a Pablo Picasso masterpiece.' It is the first time a work by Pablo Picasso (pictured) has been raffled, and will be done exclusively online . It has been authenticated by the Picasso Estate and the artist's children. The 5million euro proceeds will go towards development in the Phoenician city of Tyre, Lebanon. Participants may purchase multiple tickets to increase their chances of winning the artwork. The city is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the funds will go towards major socio-cultural projects in the area. The draw for the signed work will take place at Sotheby's in Paris on 18 December and be broadcast online. It will take place under the supervision of a court bailiff and be shown at www.1picasso100euros.com. Thomas Bompard, director of the Impressionism and Modern Art Department at Sotheby’s France, said: 'Innovate to rescue, the equation wasn’t simple. 'Sotheby’s is very pleased to support such a noble and daring cultural project. 'I love the idea that a Picasso cubist drawing protects in a way five thousand-years-old antic stones located at the seaside of the Mediterranean.' He added: 'It opens an auction house horizon.' One of the most famous artists of all time, Pablo Picasso's art pieces have sold for tens of thousands of pounds. Earlier this year, SAC Capital founder Steven Cohen paid $155million (£97million) for Le Reve, a portrait of Picasso’s mistress, Marie-Therese Walter. Picasso's 1932 work Nude, Green Leaves And Bust, meanwhile, sold in May 2010 for $106.5million (£66million) in 2010. Another of Picasso's masterpieces to sell for more than $100million was the Garcon A La Pipe. Created in 1905, it sold for $104million in 2004.","'L’Homme au Gibus' (The Man with the Opera Hat) to be raffled in December .

Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that the country 'will not fall asleep on its watch again' as he spoke about the justification for pre-emptive strike . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has spoken of the merits of pre-emptive strikes in what has been seen as a warning to Iran after talks on its nuclear programme. Speaking at an event to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War, Netanyahu told law makers there are situations when a strike is justified. He said lessons had been learned since the war, which broke out when forces led by Syria and Egypt invaded Israeli land in 1973. Thousands were killed during the 19 day conflict. Netanyahu told the Knesset: 'The enemy can surprise us. Israel will not fall asleep on its watch again', according to the Times of Israel. He said Israel would never again 'underestimate an enemy' or ignore warning signs. Speaking openly about the option of a pre-emptive strike, he said: 'But there are situations in which paying heed to the international price of such a step is outweighed by the price in blood we will pay if we absorb a strategic strike that will demand a response later on, and perhaps too late.' However, he acknowledged that such a decision would be among the most difficult a government can take. The speech comes as Netanyahu announced plans today to hold talks next week with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry about world power talks with Iran aimed at curbing its nuclear programme and peace talks with the Palestinians. The speech came as he announced plans to meet U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry about Iran . The meeting planned for October 23 . will take place in Rome, as Netanyahu visits the Italian capital for his . first face-to-face meeting with Pope Francis at the Vatican. Earlier . this week Netanyahu phoned David Cameron and France president Francois . Hollande to urge them not to ease sanctions on Iran over its nuclear . programme. The Israeli leader met U.S. President Barack Obama last week in Washington and made a speech at the U.N. General Assembly in which he said Israel was ready to stand alone to deny Iran nuclear weapons. During the speech to the Knesset, Netanyahu spoke about the importance of buffer zones. The Israeli PM reportedly phoned Mr . Cameron (left) and French President, Francois Hollande (right) to tell . them sanctions on Iran were close to achieving their goal . In remarks that will be seen as shedding light on proposed peace talks over Palestine, Netanyahu said peace is achieved when it is understood Israel is powerful. Talks between Iran and six world powers over its nuclear programme ended today. After discussions in Geneva involving Iran and the five U.N. Security Council members - the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia - and Germany, Moscow Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said he saw no guarantee of progress in future talks. He said: 'The positions of the Iranian side and the group (of six powers) are wide apart from each other - the distance can be measured in kilometres, while advances forward can be measured in steps - half a metre each.'","Benjamin Netanyahu said situations when pre-emptive strike is justified .

A 19-year-old Massachussetts man this weekend became the first known person to have bail paid after requesting someone pick him up from jail on Facebook. Arrested Saturday evening for disturbing the peace, David White’s calls home seeking assistance went unanswered, so he made the unusual step of asking police if he could post on Facebook asking for help. A friend soon arrived to pay the $40 fee needed to spring him from his cell, according to the Newburyport Daily News. The first-ever Facebook bail request: David White was released from jail this weekend after making a request on Facebook for someone to help him with bail . Police responding to a raging house party Saturday night in Beverly, on the coast about 25 miles north of Boston, encountered as many as 150 uncooperative, underage drunk people, they told the Daily News. The unruly mob forced the officers to call for backup from state police and two neighboring towns before the party was brought under control. Among the arrested was Mr White, for disorderly conduct, officials said, and his calls home went unanswered. Noting that most people don’t memorize phone numbers anymore, because they can look them up on cell phones, a detective told the Daily News that it often takes more than one call for people to find their way out of a predicament. ‘If they call mom and they can’t get her, we’re not going to say you can’t have another call,’ the detective added. ‘Not as long as they’re respectful and cooperative.’ The unruly teen soon ran out of numbers to call and came up with an unorthodox solution – Facebook. Proud man: Mr White has this logo prominently featured on his Facebook page . Noting that detainees like Mr White can be given access to their cell phone, the detective explained it must be under strict supervision. ‘A lot of people don’t want to put it on Facebook that they’ve been arrested,’ he added. With people routinely bouncing on Facebook just to see what friends are up to, someone was bound to answer the plea for help, the detective continued. After an initial Facebook post noting the unusual circumstance over the weekend, some who read it criticized the department in comments. ‘We allowed it; it worked,’ the department responded. ‘We are only required to allow one phone call, but when people are cooperative with us, we work with them, and that was the case here.’ ‘Another good reason to own a smartphone,’ the post finished. Others arrested at the bash include Ronnie Alford, 42, and wife Kimberly Alford, 43, for providing alcohol to minors. Briana Doody, 20, for drunk driving. Shawn Sequeira, 18, for possessing alcohol under the age 21.

A former waitress at the infamous Heart Attack Grill - the restaurant known for serving 'food that kills people' - has revealed she was allegedly told to film a customer who had passed out so the video could be sent to the media. Lifting the lid on what she calls the 'unprofessional', 'chaotic' and 'terribly depressing' Las Vegas chain which offers a 9,982-calorie Quadruple Bypass Burger and serves patrons over 350 pounds for free, the unidentified ex-hostess blasted the Grill in a question and answer session online yesterday. Nothing was off-limits as the waitress attacked the skimpy nurse uniform she was made to wear, how she recoiled at creepy customers who looked forward to a spanking with a paddle for not finishing their meal and how the urinals are covered in pictures of pointing women making fun of over-fed customer's manhood's. Scroll Down for Video . Unhealthy: The Heart Attack Grill, pictured, is famous for selling the world's most calorific burger . Describing the food at the restaurant, which holds the Guinness world record for the 'most calorific burger', as 'disgusting', the unidentified hostess, who admitted she was a vegan took to social media sharing website, Reddit, to air her grievances. The former waitresses name was not offered up in the 'Ask Me Anything' session, but she provided photos of herself as proof of her employment, which have since been removed. In the tell-all post, the lady claimed that in the summer of 2012 she was told by her manager that day to record a video of a customer who had passed out trying to fill his stomach with the enormous burgers served at the Heart Attack Grill. 'At one point, the man passed out. I heard him knock onto the hard ground. We had to call an ambulance. A manager made me take out my cell phone to record a video of the whole thing, so they could send it to the media,' wrote the hostess on Reddit. Nurse and patient: A happy customer of the Heart Attack Grill in Las Vegas poses with one of the hostess dressed in a nurses outfit as he prepares to eat his 8,000-calorie Quadruple Bypass Burger . 'It was on a Friday afternoon, and he hoped it would make the news so they could have a busy weekend. The food may or may not have been responsible for what happened to that man.' This is the latest of many incidences for the notorious Las Vegas restaurant. Just last week, Jon Basso, the founder and owner of Heart Attack Grill appeared on Bloomberg Television and unapologetically told viewers that his food causes people to die. 'I am probably the only restaurateur in the entire world who is unapologetically telling you that my food is bad for you, that it will kill you and that you should stay away from it,' he said. In the disturbing interview, the fast-food supremo produced a clear plastic bad filled with a suspicious powder like substance and declared, 'I'm here with the cremated remains of someone who died at my restaurant. 'He died of a heart attack at my restaurant, and I'm putting the bag clearly on the table. I wish that Burger King, McDonalds, and everyone else would do the same thing.' Danger: The owner said he discourages people from visiting the restaurant more than once a month . The disgruntled former hostess exposed the seedy goings-on inside the restaurant, which started life in Chandler, Arizona, just outside Phoenix. Describing the practice of spanking customer's who fail to finish their gargantuan meals, the waitress was ambivalent. 'It depended on who was doing spanking,' said the ex-hostess. 'Some girls were rough and put all their strength into it. I was a weakling and would lightly tap, because I also have terrible coordination and was scared I would miss and actually hurt someone. 'Also, we'd go lighter on females.' Inside the restaurant, which is designed to resemble a hospital, the waitresses wear sexy nurses uniforms, administering food as 'prescriptions' and customers who weigh over 350 pounds are able to eat for free. 'There is a scale in the middle of the restaurant where customer's are weighted,' said the hostess. 'If they pass, the scale lights up and people applaud.' Second death: Former Heart Attack Grill spokesman Blair River, pictured, died aged 29 in 2011 . Owner: 'Doctor Jon' Basso takes the pulse of Miss Plus America in his hospital-themed restaurant . Heart stopper: A customer shows off the Guinness world record-breaking burger containing 9,982 calories . Indeed, she reserved some of her deepest scorn for these free-loaders and claims there is a hardcore of regulars who eat almost daily for free. 'We'd get a few locals who would come in frequently to take advantage of the free meal. Most of them will come in, not get a drink, and not leave a tip. So that they could literally have a free meal,' said the waitress. The waitress also spoke about how condescending she felt the customers to the Las Vegas restaurant were. 'People would always talk down to us employees as well, because 1. Our uniforms were provocative, therefore in their minds we were all brainless and 2. How we are the immoral ones for serving them that food. Because it's not like people have freedom of choice when it comes to their eating habits.' Explaining that staff are paid $11 an hour plus tips, the poster claimed that on a good night she could make up to $300. Hitting back in an emailed statement to the Huffington Post, Heart Attack Grill founder Jon Basso identified the former employee and described her as 'attention seeking.' 'She had a pathetic work ethic, never made friends with her co-workers, and was continually reprimanded for cell texting friends, and we received continual costumer compliant about her poor attitude,' he added. Watch Video Here: . Party Time Fun: This customer has his 'prescription' administered by one of the Heart Attack Grill nurses in Las Vegas . Despite this, the scathing attack caught the attention of Reddit users. 'What was it like being surrounded by the fall of western civilization?' one Redditor asked the former hostess. 'It was terribly depressing,' she responded. 'Everyday we would have 5-10 people come in who actually qualify for the free meal. And that's when I would feel bad about contributing to their bad health.' The restaurant chain - founded in 2005 using the catchphrase 'Taste Worth Dying For!' - is run by a former nutritionist 'Doctor' Jon Basso who, remarkably, used to run a Jenny Craig weight loss diet centre. Meals can exceed 8,000 calories. The recommended daily intake is 2,000 calories for women and 2,500 for men. The Triple Bypass Burger contains three slabs of meat, 12 rashes of bacon, cheese, red onion, sliced tomato and the Heart Attack Grill's own 'unique special sauce'. And that's before taking into account the accompanying 'Flatliner Fries', cooked in pure lard, and a giant soft drink. A sign at the entrance to an Arizona branch of the restaurant chain reads: 'Go away. If you come in this place, it’s going to kill you.' Do you feel better? The anonymous Reddit poster said that she felt sorry for the majority of customers who pile in through the doors of the Hear Attack Grill . But the chain has provoked widespread anger with promotions including offering free food to morbidly obese customers. In February, the nofficial spokesman for the Heart Attack Grill restaurant in Las Vegas - which prides itself on 'taste worth dying for' - died of a heart attack at the age of 52. The owner of the hospital-themed restaurant, 'Doctor Jon' Basso told the Las Vegas Sun: 'I told him if you keep eating like this, it's going to kill ya. 'He'd say, ""I just love your place, Jon."" He's the only person I know who was probably at the restaurant more than I.' Alleman is the second Heart Attack Grill spokesman to die; in March 2011, 29-year-old Blair River passed away. At the time, Basso said River had succumbed to flu-related pneumonia. The following year, a customer suffered a heart attack while eating a triple bypass burger in the restaurant, and two months later, a customer collapsed while eating a double bypass burger. Speaking to Eater Vegas last year, Basso said his business was 'absolutely honest' and said he warned people against going to the restaurant more than once a month. 'I say it right in the door, ""Caution this establishment is bad for your health', he said.","Former employee of the Heart Attack Grill reveals 'unprofessional' working practices inside the notorious Las Vegas restaurant .

Springwatch star Chris Packham has revealed he stole a kestrel chick from its nest when he was a boy, sparking a fascination with wildlife that shaped his career. Packham, 52, said his actions - which have echoes of the 1969 film Kes - ‘defined the rest of my life’. In an emotional interview on today’s Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, the presenter recalls the precise moment he took the bird when he was 14 and how he was left speechless for days after it died. Chris Packham (left) stole a kestrel chick from its nest when he was a boy, sparking a fascination with wildlife. He said his actions - which have echoes of the 1969 film Kes (right) - 'defined the rest of my life' He said: ‘I found a nest. On June 26, 1975, at about 2.15pm, I climbed to it and I removed one of the youngsters illegally.’ He added: ‘I think that what happened as a result of me taking that bird out of the nest was incredibly important and defined the rest of my life. I loved that bird and that was the first time that I learned to love something.’ Packham, now vice-president of the RSPB, said he resorted to taking the bird only after he was refused a licence which would have allowed him to own one legally. His love for his charge recalls the plot line of Ken Loach’s film Kes which tells the story of Billy Casper, 15, and his love for the kestrel he steals from a nest on a farm. Billy, played by David Bradley, raises the bird in secret and the animal becomes a symbol of the boy’s desperation to escape the humdrum existence of his life in  a South Yorkshire mining town. The 1969 film, based on the book A Kestrel For A Knave by Barry Hines, is ranked  seventh in the British Film Institute’s list of the 100 Best British films ever made, and is in its top ten list of the 50 films every child should see by the time they turn 14. Packham said: ‘The relationship between a man and bird is very different than between man and dog. It’s an animal you coax into a tameness. You never extract the wildness from the bird. You have to give everything to it.’ Packham, now vice-president of the RSPB, said he resorted to taking the bird only after he was refused a licence which would have allowed him to own one legally . Packham’s obsession with the bird consumed his every waking moment – which is exactly what happens to Billy in the film. He said: ‘I got up before school and at six o’clock in the morning I would go down and prepare its food. ‘I would go out and would fly it before school. I would run to school late and I would run back at lunchtime to make sure it was OK.’ ‘Of course the whole thing had to be kept secret. No one at school knew.’ He recalls the moment of pride when he confided his secret to one of the few people he could trust. He said: ‘The only person I told was John Buckley, who was my biology teacher and an incredibly important early mentor in my life. ‘One morning he came to see it fly. I was so pleased to be able to stand there with my bird and fly it. And it went and sat in a tree. It didn’t perform. It sat in a tree and just looked at us.’ The police did visit Packham’s family home in Southampton and told him that he should not have the bird but they appear not to have taken any further action. A tearful Packham recalled: ‘The bird became ill at the end of the summer and I sought the best veterinary care that I could. But the condition that it had was invariably fatal. ‘On December 6, a Saturday evening, it died in my arms. It affected me profoundly. I couldn’t speak for days.’ The police did visit Packham's family home in Southampton and told him that he should not have the bird but they appear not to have taken any further action . Packham, who shot to fame in the 1980s on the children’s programme The Really Wild Show, was last week tipped as a possible successor to Sir David Attenborough as the face of BBC wildlife. He said last night that he expected to get ‘some flak’ because of his confession, but added: ‘But if it wasn’t for that bird I wouldn’t be talking to you now. We are talking about something which happened in the 1970s when attitudes were different. ‘I think I can honestly say I have put a lot more into conservation than I have taken out of it.’","Springwatch star revealed he stole the chick on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs .

"By . Harry Mount . PUBLISHED: . 16:52 EST, 16 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:32 EST, 16 October 2013 . For centuries it was the myth that transfixed fortune-hunters: El Dorado, the dazzling city made of gold, hidden in deepest South America. Countless European bounty seekers lost their lives in search of this legendary place. Others believed that El Dorado was not a city at all, but a man painted with powdered  gold who had dived into Lake Guatavita, near the modern Colombian capital of Bogota, and whose priceless body lay waiting to be discovered. Neither the city nor the man was ever found. But as a new exhibition at the British Museum, opening today, shows, European explorers did find an ancient civilisation seemingly obsessed with gold and other precious metals, mined in the Andes. Scroll down for video . Prized beast: This flask has been carved in the shape of a Jaguar, and has a nose ring made of platinum . This was a society with its own sophisticated religious, social and musical rites — but also one capable of extreme violence and addicted to the intoxicating coca leaf, the raw material of modern cocaine. In the new show, 200 objects from the Museo del Oro in Bogota and 100 from the British Museum reveal just how devoted to gold the pre-Hispanic civilisations, from 1600 BC to AD 1600, were. They didn’t see gold as a currency but as a magical material of great symbolic and spiritual meaning, closely connected to the immense powers of the sun. Gold was used to make models of the alligators and jaguars to be found in the South American jungles. The ancient Colombians revered the animals and thought that if they donned their skins, they could assume their athletic powers. The jaguar was particularly prized for its strength and ferocity, and its skins were worn by the society’s leaders. Figure of fear: This flask, or 'poporo', shows a human face wearing a peacock headdress . One star exhibit in this show is a flask in the shape of a jaguar made from hammered gold sheets — with a platinum ring strung through its nose. Platinum was as prized as gold in ancient Colombia. In order to make the transition from the human world to the animal one, these pre-Hispanic civilisations also devised golden costumes. ‘Birds, bats, felines, amphibians, snakes and alligators were just some of the powerful disguises adopted,’ says Elisenda Vila Llonch, the curator of the show. Sitting pretty: This female figure, left, which would have been used for holding lime powder, features in the exhibition alongside this religious chest ornament, right . ‘Representations of these animals were frequently made in elaborate gold pieces. ‘Gold objects, including nose, lip and ear ornaments, diadems [ornamental headbands], pectorals [decorations worn on the chest] and pendants enabled a person’s physical transformation, together with paint, animal pelts and feathers.’ They used gold, too, to contain their favourite narcotic stimulants from plants including tobacco, cocaine and the yopo — a tree that produces leaves and beans with hallucinogenic effects. On show at the British Museum is a huge, egg-shaped shell of gold alloy, 21.4cm long and 10.5cm wide. Finery: The pre-Hispanic people used gold for all sorts of ornaments, including this necklace . This priceless artefact was made purely for the purpose of holding coca leaves. Another exhibit shows a man sitting down in a state of blissful leisure, chewing on a wad of the same leaves. The pre-Hispanic civilisations became extremely adept at drug-taking. In order for the stimulants to be absorbed better, they were combined with a chalky powder made from lime and smashed seashells. Delicately carved golden dippers — . like pipettes — were used to carry the intoxicating powder from . elaborate drug pouches to the mouth. At other times they used gold snuff . trays — like ornate mini-shovels — piled high with dried or crushed . yopo seeds, which they then swallowed or sniffed. By . taking these intoxicating substances, the men of this ancient . civilisation believed that their spirits might leave their bodies — just . as they did through the wearing of animal skins. Dazzling: An alligator pendant. Powerful creatures were revered and often crafted from gold . A priest told one of the first Spanish colonials that, under the influence of yopo beans, he had ‘flown’ a vast distance to and from the distant village of Santa Marta in a single night. So the idea of the drug trip is certainly nothing new. But the world of El Dorado was far from being a zonked-out, peace-and-love civilisation. Many of the gold objects in the British Museum exhibition are devoted to warfare, including spear-throwers — sheaths in which a spear was placed before it was hurled, to give it greater reach. One tunjo — or religious figurine — in the exhibition shows a small golden figure at work on the most spine-chilling of activities: headhunting. Grisly: This figure shows a headhunter carrying a shrunken head . In one hand he holds a bow and arrows, in the other the shrunken head of his victim. Two other tunjos show a pair of dead victims tied to sacrificial poles. Headhunting is thought to have been a common practice in warfare, and these tunjos are supposed by experts to symbolise victory on the battlefield over rival tribes. The 16th-century Spanish chronicler Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo y Valdes described the ritual, saying: ‘If the men of Bogota kill or take any Panches Indians prisoner, they take the heads back to their homeland and put them in their oratories [or prayer chapels].’ Meanwhile, in Spain at around the same time, men were becoming ever more obsessed with the lure of gold. As Christopher Columbus wrote to the king and queen of Spain in 1503: ‘Gold is the most exquisite of all things. Whoever possesses gold can acquire all that he desires in this world. Truly, for gold he can acquire entrance for his soul into paradise.’ And so, from the early years of the 16th century onwards, Spanish adventurers, their imaginations fired by tales of El Dorado, poured into South America in search of gold. It was this precious metal, in fact, that provided the main reason for colonising South America. ‘In their eagerness to obtain gold they paid scant attention to the objects into which it was fashioned,’ says Elisenda Vila Llonch. ‘They  had no interest in how or why such items were crafted, or in the archaeological contexts in which they were found: treasure seekers looted burial mounds and often melted down the gold items they found.’ In a 1550 ruling by the royal  Spanish legal court, all pre-Hispanic objects were divided into two categories: gold was to be melted down in furnaces for currency; ritual objects made of bone, shell, wood and feathers — classed as ‘idols of the Devil’ — were to be confiscated and destroyed. Thus the survival of the objects in the British Museum exhibition is near miraculous, given that ancient tombs, piled high with food, drink, fine textiles and gold masks and chest ornaments for use in the afterlife, were plundered and despoiled. But what really fuelled the  Spaniards’ gold fever was the legend of El Dorado, the Golden One. Mask: This artefact may have been stored away for use in the afterlife . The story is first mentioned by Fernandez de Oviedo in his history of the region, written from 1535 to 1548. Oviedo tells of a ‘golden king’ who ‘went about covered with  powdered gold, as casually as if it were powdered salt’. In time, this story became magnified and embellished until European adventurers, including Sir Walter Raleigh — and his son Watt, who was killed battling the Spanish over South American gold — began to believe in a whole golden city or kingdom. However implausible it may seem to us now, there was a tiny kernel of truth at the heart of the fabulously embroidered tale. The Muisca people of ancient Colombia were known to have carried out ritual practices on the shores of Lake Guatavita, a round lake that sits in the crater of an extinct volcano. Tales of one ritual captured Europe’s imagination like no other.  At its height, a Muisca leader was covered in gold dust and taken on a raft to the middle of the lake, where he and his servants threw piles of gold, emeralds and other jewels into the water. Intricate: This golden helmet has been elaborately patterned by ancient craftsmen . It was believed that these treasures would reach the gods, who would restore order to the world. Among the gold objects were those tunjos — ritual human figurines. One miraculous Muisca tunjo that survives shows the raft ritual as it happened. A large figure stands in the middle of the raft, attended on all sides by smaller figures. The main figure is adorned with a gold head-dress, chest plates and nose ornaments. Full-size versions of these golden religious ornaments are also on show at the British Museum. Little wonder that, as soon as the Spanish heard of this ritual, they rushed to drain the lake. In 1580 a notch was cut in the crater that reduced the water level by 20 metres before the crater collapsed, drowning many of the workers. Some of the discoveries there — golden ornaments, jewellery and armour — were sent to King Philip II of Spain, and a great, ugly scar runs through the side of the crater to this day. Then, in 1910, a group of British speculators again tried to drain the crater and recovered some gold ornaments and pottery from the bottom of the lake. But they never found the spectacular hoard they sought. The Colombian government has outlawed draining of the lake now, so the remaining secrets of El Dorado, which have fascinated explorers for centuries, will lie concealed and undisturbed, deep beneath its waters — at least until the glittering myth once again proves too great a temptation for explorers to resist.","The myth of El Dorado has gripped explorers for centuries .

A grieving mother today criticised a hospital consultant who misdiagnosed her dying daughter and then sent a grovelling apology note - blaming the mistake on being busy. Jayne Hughes, 44, died at her home in Lydney, Gloucestershire, after doctors failed to spot a blood clot on her lungs when she was taken to Accident & Emergency following a fall downstairs. Following the tumble she was breathless, had high blood pressure and heart rate and a low oxygen saturation, an inquest at Gloucester Coroner’s Court was told. Angry: Carol Woodward (left) hit out after the consultant who misdiagnosed her daughter Jayne Hughes (right) sent her an apologetic note claiming she was 'focused on rapidly assessing and reviewing patients' But despite her symptoms, which were all indicators of the clot - known as a pulmonary embolism - she was sent home with painkillers after a doctor concentrated on checking for injuries from the fall. Now, her grieving mother, Carol Woodward, 65, has hit out after the consultant sent an apologetic note claiming she was ‘very busy’ and ‘focused on rapidly assessing and reviewing patients’. Mrs Woodward said: ‘It was just so cruel. She admitted her mistake and admitted she was busy. It was an insult to her life. The note was an absolute insult. I didn’t want to hear that from her. ‘They had already admitted they were wrong. She wrote in it about how she was sorry, and has been working the last nine months to see it shouldn’t happen again. ‘I was just so shocked, I was gobsmacked. When I opened it I thought it was from a friend writing a card, but it wasn’t at all. I didn’t want that note. It has just made me so angry.’ Mrs Woodward flung the handwritten note across the courtroom towards A&E consultant Delia Parnham-Cope, as she gave evidence at her daughter’s inquest. Upsetting: Carol Woodward flung the handwritten note (pictured) across the courtroom towards A&E consultant Delia Parnham-Cope, as she gave evidence at her daughter Jayne Hughes's inquest . Condolences: The back and front covers of the card sent to Mrs Williams by consultant Miss Parnham-Cope . In the card, the consultant said she ‘clearly should have been looking in depth’ and had spent the past nine months reviewing her practice. She wrote: ‘I saw Miss Hughes as a “trauma patient”. As we were very busy I focused on rapidly assessing and reviewing patients. 'I can only say sorry': Consultant Delia Parnham Cope sent an apology note to Mrs Woodward . ‘I clearly should have been looking in depth at what had caused your daughter to be unwell and subsequently fallen downstairs. ‘Over the last nine months I have reviewed what happened, had additional training and looked very closely at how I practice, especially when the department is busy. ‘I can only say sorry and work harder to improve my clinical practice in the future.’ Miss Hughes died at her home two days after suffering a dizzy spell and falling down her stairs on December 17 last year. She was taken to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital where, after tests showed no fractures or heart problems, Miss Parnham-Cope sent her home with painkillers and muscle relaxant drug diazepam. But she agreed with assistant coroner Katie Skerrett that discharging Miss Hughes was ‘wrong’. Within hours her condition worsened and her mother took her to her local surgery, Severnbank, in Lydney. She was seen by locum GP Dr Meenakshi Raina - who decided her symptoms were due to her known conditions of anxiety and asthma and sent her home. The inquest was told practice nurse Lorna Bird Jayne immediately put her on oxygen while she waited to see the GP, where Miss Hughes reportedly told staff she felt ‘like I’m dying’. Miss Hughes was found dead in bed the next morning. Just months after her death, Miss Parnham-Cope sent a note to Mrs Woodward apologising for her mistakes. In a hospital investigation into the tragedy, Dr Tom Llewellyn said symptoms were ‘overlooked’ by Miss Parnham-Cope and appropriate treatment was not given. Death: Jayne Hughes, 44, with Mrs Woodward's great granddaughter. She died at home in Gloucestershire . He added that she had failed to undertake a thorough and detailed examination, partly due to an increased workload and the absence of a middle grade doctor. Pathologist Dr Chamia de Cates said Ms . Hughes died from bilateral pulmonary embolus caused by a blood clot in a . vein of the left calf. 'It was just so cruel. She admitted her mistake and admitted she was busy. It was an insult to her life' Carol Woodward . Coroner Skerrett concluded a narrative verdict, saying: ‘The pulmonary embolus went undiagnosed and the deterioration in her condition went unrecognised’. But Mrs Woodward blasted the outcome, and said Miss Parnham-Cope should not still be allowed to work. She said: ‘She has not even been suspended after admitting she did something awful. She admitted she was wrong, why is she still working? It shouldn’t have happened. 'There was no need for it to happen. I was so angry when she was giving evidence that I through her card back at her. ‘I know I shouldn’t have done but I was so upset to see her there admitting she made a mistake which took my daughter away from me.’ 29/9/13Emergency Dept, Gloucs Royal Hospital, Gloucs . Dear Mrs Woodward, . I am the consultant who saw your daughter Jayne Hughes in the Emergency Department on the morning of December 17, 2012. I assessed Miss Hughes, organised investigations and subsequently decided Miss Hughes did not need admission. Your daughter died two days later. I apologise whole-heartedly that I got your daughter’s diagnosis wrong. 'I can only say sorry and work harder to improve my clinical practice in the future' I have spent the last nine months reviewing (with colleagues in the hospital) and how I could have made such a mistake. Miss Hughes fell and hit her head. She came to the Emergency Department immobilised in a collar with a history of falling. I saw Miss Hughes as a 'trauma patient'. As we were very busy I focused on rapidly assessing and reviewing patients. I saw your daughter, made decisions about her injuries and was reassured as her chest X-ray and shoulder X-ray were normal. I then discharged your daughter. I clearly should have been looking in depth at what had caused your daughter to be unwell and subsequently fallen downstairs. Over the last nine months I have reviewed what happened, had additional training and looked very closely at how I practice, especially when the department is busy.

Tory MP Eleanor Laing has been elected Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons, beating six other candidates. The Conservative MP for Epping Forest, the favourite for the role, saw off Conservative Brian Binley by 257 votes to 240. She will join John Bercow’s team after Nigel Evans stood down to fight sex offence charges last month, and will be one of three deputies to stand in for Mr Bercow. The position carries a salary premium of £36,360 on top of an MP’s salary, so she will receive a total of £102,098 a year. Miss Laing, who was a shadow justice minister in 2009, was forced to pay back £25,000 in the MPs’ expenses scandal and saw off an attempt to have her deselected as MP for Epping Forest. She won a vote of confidence from her local party after anger that she sold her state-funded second home for a £1million profit without paying capital gains tax by calling it her ‘primary residence’. After an outcry, she offered to pay back the money as a ‘moral gesture’. Miss Laing said yesterday: ‘May I also . on behalf of all the candidates who took part thank each of the other . candidates for the demure and pleasant way in which this election has . been conducted, and may I thank the House for placing their confidence . in me to let me become part of your team.’ Mr Bercow said yesterday: . ‘I congratulate the honourable lady warmly, and I may say on behalf of . my colleagues and myself that we all greatly look forward to working . with her.’ As a Conservative, Mr Evans could only be replaced by another . governing-party MP under Commons rules - although no Lib Dems applied. Ahead of the election, Miss Laing spoke of the Commons’ ‘vital, essential role as a forum for national debate’, adding: ‘I would like to be part of the Speaker’s team, not just to keep order in the chamber but to stand up for the rights of the backbenches... against overbearing governments.’ Excited: Speaker John Bercow said he was looking forward to working with Miss Laing .

"By . James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 19:08 EST, 16 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:08 EST, 16 October 2013 . David Cameron yesterday signalled income tax cuts are being considered for the 5million workers due to be paying the 40 per cent rate by 2015. The Coalition has taken millions of low-paid and part-time workers out of income tax altogether by increasing the personal allowance thresholds from £6,475 a year to £10,000, . At Prime Minister’s Questions, Tory MP Dominic Raab welcomed the moves to help basic rate taxpayers, but urged Mr Cameron to act to help those on the higher rate. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, David Cameron said he wanted to 'see taxes cut for all' He said the Government needed to ‘ease the squeeze on the middle classes’. Mr Cameron said: ‘Yes, I want to see taxes cut for all.’ The hike in personal allowance thresholds at the lower end means 2.7million people have been lifted out of paying any income tax at all since 2010. For the average taxpayer, it will amount to paying £705 less income tax compared to when the Coalition took power. But at the other end, the numbers dragged into paying 40p income tax is expected to rise from 4.1million today to 4.9million in 2014. Changes announced in the last Budget mean that for most people the point at which they start to pay higher rate tax will be £41,865. It means one in six workers will pay 40 per cent of every extra pound they earn to the Treasury. In 1978, only three per cent of taxpayers paid tax at the higher rate. In 1989, the figure had barely moved to just five per cent. MP Dominic Raab has called on David Cameron to 'ease the squeeze on the middle classes' Normally, the 40 per cent higher-tax threshold rises in line with inflation to take into account rises in the cost of living. But from April 2014, the point at which higher rate tax is paid is to rise by a flat 1 per cent for two years instead. This lower rise in the threshold means more workers will be caught in the 40 per cent net. ‘This means also someone on minimum wage working full time has seen their tax bill come down by something like two-thirds.’ At the Conservative Party conference this month Mr Cameron said that a future Tory government would ‘cut taxes for hard-working people’ as the economy recovers. George Osborne, the Chancellor, has ruled out borrowing more to fund tax cuts, meaning any further tax cuts are dependent on increased economic growth. There is increasing speculation that the Tories will go into the next election pledging to increase the income tax threshold further to £12,500, bringing it broadly in line with the minimum wage. Mr Raab pointed to a Lib Dem briefing note accidentally released at the party’s conference last month which suggested that there should be ‘a further contribution’ from ‘those earning over £50,000’, arguing that ‘these are not the middle income earners’. ‘It is true that, if you earn £50,000, you are in the top ten per cent of earners,’ Mr Raab added. ‘But that takes no account of varying regional costs of living, especially in London, other cities and suburbs, or the South East more generally. ‘It overlooks the fact that those earning £50,000 or more already pay 57 per cent of the income tax take, or that around two million extra middle income workers have already been sucked into paying the 40p rate of income tax in recent years.’ The MP said that a Lib Dem ‘tax assault’ on the middle classes would ‘go down like a lead balloon during an election’. Around 800,000 extra hard-working people have already been caught in the higher rate tax trap since David Cameron entered Downing Street. Official figures, from HM Revenue and Customs, show there were just three million higher rate taxpayers when the coalition came to power in May 2010. An analysis by the Taxpayers’ Alliance shows the starting salary for higher rate tax would currently be £63,777, rather than £42,475, if it had been ‘uprated’ each year by earnings, not inflation.","David Cameron said he wants to see tax reductions for all .

"By . Wills Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 04:14 EST, 17 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:34 EST, 17 October 2013 . Pupils at one of London's top pre-prep schools have been banned from having nuts for breakfast at home in cases it triggers a reaction in fellow classmates. Eaton House Belgravia School in London, which has tuition fees of £13,320-a-year, sent a letter to parents saying children must not have peanut butter or cereals with nuts during the week. The strict policy has been put in place because the school claims some pupils have 'extreme allergies' where even the smell could trigger a severe reaction. Rules: Eaton House Belgravia School in London has told parents not to let their children eat anything containing nuts for breakfast because the smell could trigger an allergic reaction . The private school, which takes boys between the ages of four and eight, has also asked children not to bring in sandwiches or yoghurt for their break because they could be 'messy' in the classroom. Headmistress Miss Lucy Watts said in her welcome letter at the start of the year: 'Owing to some extreme allergies, please do not give your son anything like peanut butter or cereals containing nuts for breakfast during the week as this can have an effect on boys with allergies.' Many schools in the UK have already prohibited children from bringing products containing nuts into schools, but Eaton House has gone one step further, extending the ban to morning meals at home. A charity which supports people with . severe allergies is against such bans in schools because it threatens to give children a 'false sense of security'. Guidelines: A copy of Headmistress Miss Lucy Watts' welcome letter which outlines the rules . The Anaphylaxis Campaign said: 'There is a strong case for arguing that food-allergic children will gain a better awareeness of their allergies, and learn avoidance strategies, if they move in an environment where allergies may turn up unexpectedly' Miss Watts said she had received no complaints from parents since the stringent policy was introduced. She told The Daily Telegraph: 'We've had boys with allergies so severe that, even if they're sitting next to someone who has eaten something like nuts or dairy, that can cause a reaction.' Facts: Around one in 100 people in the UK suffer from a nut allergy, with most being children . Peanuts are among the most common allergy-causing foods and affect around one in every 100 people in the UK. Although a small amount of peanut protein can set off a severe reaction, it is rare for a reaction to be triggered just from breathing in small particles of nuts or peanuts. Most foods containing peanuts do not allow enough protein to escape into the air to cause a reaction and, according to website TeensHealth, just the smell of foods containing peanuts won't produce a reaction because the scent does not contain the protein. The allergy to peanut and tree nuts is the most common found in adults and children. However, since most children start eating other foods first, allergies to other foods such as egg and cows' milk protein typically present before nut allergies. While children often grow out of other allergies, only around 20% of children with nut allergies resolve. This means that 4 out of 5 children with nut allergies will continue to have these allergies as an adult. In some people, the allergy may become less severe with age, but in 20%, it can become worse with time.","Eaton House Belgravia School in London introduced the strict guidelines .

Five million babies have now been born worldwide with the help of fertility treatment - half of them in the last six years. The first ‘test tube baby’, Louise Brown, was born in 1978 and by 1990 there had been an estimated 90,000 births resulting from assisted reproductive technology (ART) worldwide. By 2000, the figure stood at an estimated 900,000. The first 'test tube baby', Louise Brown, was born in July 1978 at Oldham General Hospital. She is pictured with her parents and the nurses who cared for her . Since 2000, the number of births resulting from fertility treatment has rocketed and by 2007 it was estimated that more than 2.5 million children had been born using assisted reproductive technology. Since 2007, it is believed that about 2.5 million babies have been born following fertility treatment,  bringing the total to date to about five million, according to a report by the International Committee for the Monitoring of Assisted Reproductive Technology. Richard Kennedy, from the International Federation of Fertility Societies said: ‘This comprehensive report confirms that we now have over five million babies born through assisted reproduction. ‘More than that, it shows that half of them have been born in the last six years. ‘The number of babies born through ART is now about the same as the population of a U.S. state such as Colorado, or a country such as Lebanon or Ireland. This is a great medical success story.’ IVF was pioneered by Sir Robert Edwards, who died earlier this year, and by Dr Patrick Steptoe. Since 2007, about 2.5 million 'test tube babies' have been born. Louise Brown (right with her son, Cameron) is pictured with Sir Robert Edwards, one of the pioneers of IVF, and her mother, Lesley Brown . Their technique led to the birth of Louise Brown on July 25, 1978, at Oldham General Hospital. The treatment involved an egg being removed from one of her mother’s ovaries with a probe before being mixed with her father’s sperm in a petri dish – not a test tube. The resulting embryo was implanted in Mrs Brown’s womb two days later. Mrs Brown was not the first woman to become pregnant after IVF treatment, but none of the previous pregnancies had lasted for more than a few weeks. Now, about 180,000 IVF babies are born in Britain each year. Following each cycle of IVF, a woman . under the age of 35 has a 32 per cent chance of conceiving, a 35 to . 37-year-old has a 28 per cent chance, a 38 to 39-year-old has a 21 per . cent chance and a 40 to 42-year-old has a 14 per cent chance. In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is one of several techniques available to help couples with fertility problems to have a baby. During IVF, an egg is surgically removed from the woman's ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory. The fertilised egg, now called an embryo, is then returned to the woman's womb to grow and develop. An IVF cycle starts with a woman being given drugs to suppress her menstrual cycle. Once this has happened, she is given a fertility hormone called FSH which increases the number of eggs the ovaries produce. The eggs will then be collected by using a needle to remove them from the ovaries. The eggs are then mixed with sperm in a laboratory and any fertilised eggs are left for a few days before being transferred into the womb. Currently, women under 40 are offered three cycles of IVF treatment on the NHS if they have been trying to get pregnant for more than two years or if they have not been able to get pregnant after 12 cycles of artificial insemination. Women aged between 40 and 42 are offered one cycle of IVF on the NHS if they have been trying for a baby for two years, if they have never had IVF before, if they show no evidence of low ovarian reserve and if they have been informed of the risks of IVF and pregnancy at their age. Following each cycle of IVF, a woman under the age of 35 has a 32 per cent chance of conceiving, a 35 to 37-year-old has a 28 per cent chance, a 38 to 39-year-old has a 21 per cent chance and a 40 to 42-year-old has a 14 per cent chance.","The first 'test tube baby', Louise Brown, was born in July 1978 .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 02:05 EST, 17 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:11 EST, 17 October 2013 . Northern voters have deserted the Tories because David Cameron reminds them of everything they hate about the party, a damning new analysis reveals. While voters in the north are just as likely to support policies on welfare, tax and law and order, the toxic Tory ‘brand’ means they refuse to back them at elections. Mr Cameron is urged to promote more northern MPs with regional accents on to his front bench to counter the entrenched view that he cares more about the rich than ordinary people. Mind the gap: Voters in the north are more likely to take a dim view of the Tories by a margin of up to 10 per cent . New polling shows voters in the north are significantly more likely to think Mr Cameron is out of touch, has no clear principles and is doing badly as Prime Minister than those in the south. In 2010 only 31 per cent of voters in the north backed the Conservatives, compared to 43 per cent in the rest of England. By comparison, when Winston Churchill was Tory leader in 1951 the gap was only three points. Some 42 per cent of voters think Mr Cameron is out of touch, compared to just 32 per cent in the south. Asked if Mr Cameron 'has no clear principles', 47 per cent of people in the north agreed, much higher than the 39 per cent in the south. Headache: David Cameron is under pressure to win back support from northern voters . And 45 per cent of southern voters thought he was 'doing well as Prime Minister', but only 36 per cent of northerners agreed. YouGov Pollster Peter Kellner said the Tories’ problems did not start with Mr Cameron, but neither have they lessened under his leadership. ‘Rather, he reminds many northerners just why they dislike the Tory Party,’ he warned in an article for Prospect magazine. He found that ‘over the decades, the north has drifted away from the rest of the country.’ Last week's government reshuffle was in part designed to counter the impression of the Tory party being too southern. Dubbed the 'flat cap reshuffle' a number of northern MPs were given more high profile ministerial jobs. They included Liverpudlian former TV presenter Esther McVey becoming employment minister and Sajid Javid, who was born in Rochdale, who was promoted from a junior Treasury post to the rank of Financial Secretary. The collapse of heavy industry in the . north, more closely associate with the Labour party, has not led to a . rise in popularity for the Tories – in fact the opposite has happened. Mr Kellner found that standards of . living are ‘actually much the same’ in the north and south, with pay . rates outside London largely in line. Unemployment in the north stands at nine per cent compared to six per cent in the south. But in the West Midlands it is even higher at 10 per cent, and the Tories won 43 per cent of the vote there in 2010. Northern voices: Liverpudlian former TV presenter Esther McVey was promoted to employment minister in last week's reshuffle while Rochdale-born Sajid Javid was rewarded with a more senior role in the Treasury . There is also ‘no material difference’ between how voters feel about their living standards or where they view . themselves on the political spectrum from ‘very right wing’ to ‘very . left wing’. On the role of the government, public services, the railways and welfare, there is almost no difference in views. Mr Kellner said: ‘This simply sharpens . the question - if the obvious reasons for Conservative unpopularity in . the north do not really hold up, what does explain why they are so . disliked? ‘Northerners . dislike David Cameron. They are significantly more likely to say he is . out of touch and lacks clear principles, and much less likely to say he . is doing well as Prime Minister. ‘And . despite the comparable living standards and levels of optimism, . northerners are much more likely to think the coalition “is bad for . people like you”.’ Broad agreement: The views on key issues and polices vary far less between north and south . While most people across the country think the Tories care more about the rich, ‘the sentiment is especially intense in the north’. And there appears to be no easy solution to the problem.

George Osborne yesterday welcomed investment in the UK by a controversial Chinese internet giant, despite warnings it could be spying on the West. Speaking during a visit to China, the Chancellor brushed aside the security concerns over Huawei that have seen its operations limited or banned in the US, Australia and India. Welcoming plans by the firm to build a £125 million research and development centre in Britain, Mr Osborne said: ‘There are some Western governments that have blocked Huawei from making investments. Not Britain. Quite the opposite.’ Welcome: George Osborne, pictured with Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei, today praised the expansion of Chinese tech firms despite cyber-security fears . Trip: The Chancellor visited Huawei's headquarters in Shenzhen as part of an official tour of China . Earlier this year MPs warned that . Huawei could be monitoring British internet users via the infrastructure . it provides to BT and O2. A . Commons’ security committee warned that the Chinese government might be . able to ‘intercept covertly or disrupt traffic passing through . Huawei-supplied networks’. And . last year a US Congressional committee called for American companies . not to do business with the firm because it posed a threat to national . security. Huawei, which was . founded by a former officer in the People’s Liberation Army, has long . been accused of close links with the Chinese military and government.

Ties: Huawei has announced that it will invest an additional £125million in Britain . Fears: Huawei has been accused of helping China spy on internet traffic via joint ventures in the West . MPs . have called for GCHQ to take over the centre, which is now being . investigated. Last year Major General Jonathan Shaw, a former . cyber-security expert at the Ministry of Defence, said that Britain was . ‘dealing with the devil’ in allowing Huawei access to its electronic . infrastructure. A Treasury . source insisted the Government was happy with Huawei’s operations in the . UK, as were other countries such as Germany and Sweden. The source said . the firm met ‘clear and stringent security rules’. During . a visit to the firm’s headquarters in Shenzhen, Mr Osborne described it . as a ‘great hi-tech company’. He praised the ‘huge opportunity’ presented by the rise of Chinese technology firms, pointing to gaming . company Rekoo’s decision to open an office in London’s Tech City. Companion: Boris Johnson is also in China; he is pictured looking at the Shanghai skyline today . ‘Huawei . and Rekoo’s investment into the UK is a great testament to Britain’s . tech industry and I am here to make sure that relationship goes from . strength to strength,’ he said.

Funeral attendees, who were paying their respects to Frank Conway, 88, were shocked by his use of coarse language during his address to the congregation. Mr Conway lived as an old-fashioned retainer on the 15,000-acre estate, running a travelers bunkhouse in a former Loch Nevis church that is owned by Sir Cameron. Sir Cameron, who owns a 15,000-acre Nevis Estate in the Highlands near where the funeral took place, is said to have used swear words and inappropriate phrases, such as 'fornicating p****.' 'Disgrace': Sir Cameron Mackintosh, left, is said to have upset mourners and the vicar while giving a eulogy at the funeral of his friend and former employee Frank Conway, right . The incident has now been reported to the Bishop of Argyll and the Isles. Councillor for Caol and Mallaig Bill Clark said: 'I cannot believe he would use language like that in the church.

'It's unwritten . that you don't use language like this in that situation.' Service: Sir Cameron's eulogy was given at the Our Lady of Perpetual Succour and St Cumin church, pictured, in Morar, Inverness and was met with uproar from the congregation . The . funeral service was held by Father Joseph Calleja, who said: 'I was . upset by it and still am. If you cannot say something good about . somebody, you should say nothing.' Sir Cameron, 66, was telling a story . about Mr Conway's time running a bunkhouse in Tarbet and referring to a . letter sent to him by two dissatisfied German tourists when he made the . comments. Mourners attempted to shout Sir Cameron down during the service held at Our Lady of Perpetual Succour and St Cumin in Morar. Retired skipper Alex Donald, 72, who was at the funeral on October 4, added: 'It is the talk of the local area. Outrage: Sir Cameron, who has a built a personal fortune of £725million as a producer of numerous West End shows, has been reported to the Bishop of Argyll and the Isles and may receive a formal rebuke . 'He has done a lot of good for the community, but now his name is mud. 'He is an educated man and should have known better.' Sir Cameron travelled from Canada for the funeral of Mr Conway who died at Raigmore Hospital, Inverness. He said: 'What I read at the service was simply from Frank's own book with his memoirs and I was using his own words and from his own material.' 'In fact, I toned down a lot of the language that Frank had used. 'The congregation were there to celebrate Frank's life and I was very pleased that his family and many others were grateful that I properly reflected Frank's personality and the life of a very special and much-loved person.' Retired lecturer Alasdair Roberts, a friend of Mr Conway, who attended the service defended Sir Cameron's comments. He said: 'When Frank ran the bunkhouse, he fell out with two German tourists who were staying there and they left a letter describing him in the terms some found offensive when read out. 'It was Frank's favourite letter which he showed a lot of people.' Joseph Toal, Bishop of Argyll and the Isles, confirmed that  the incident had been reported to him.

Habit: Mother-of-five Smith smoked 40 cannabis joints a day to relieve pain from an accident, she claimed . A crash victim awarded £130,000 in compensation has blown the lot - on cannabis, a court heard. Sally Smith, 39, won the six-figure pay-out after she was left wheelchair-bound when she was mown down by a car on a pedestrian crossing in 2003. But the mum-of-five was so overcome with pain she developed a 40-joint-a-day marijuana dependence. In July Smith was caught supplying £1,000 of the Class B drug to a friend and hauled before the courts. During sentencing, Maidstone Crown Court heard Smith’s money had literally gone up in smoke because she used it to fund her drug habit. On Monday Judge Charles Byers told her: ‘Both of you must understand that whatever people say cannabis is a dangerous drug. ‘It can cause the most enormous problems for the people who take it.’ Ben Irwin, mitigating, told the court his client has suffered ‘post traumatic stress disorder’ as a result of her accident. He said: ‘She turned to smoking cannabis as a way of dealing with those demons and making her day to day life all the more tolerable. ‘She couldn’t cope with having that much money and it all went far too soon. ‘It wasn’t a desire to make money or a profit. It was about making sure the pain wasn’t so acute.’ Smith, from Tonbridge Wells, Kent, admitted possessing cannabis with intent to supply, producing cannabis and supplying cannabis. Verdict: Smith was sentenced to eight months jail suspended for two years by Maidstone Crown Court . The friend to whom she supplied the drug, Paul Fletcher, 34, from, Hildenborough, Kent, also admitted possession with intent to supply. Both were sentenced to eight months jail suspended for two years and ordered to each pay £250 court costs. Smith was also given a three-month curfew from 7pm to 3am while father-of-one Fletcher was ordered to carry out 150 hours unpaid work, supervision for 18 months and attend a Thinking Skills programme.","Sally Smith, 39, from Kent developed a 40-a-day marijuana dependence .

A teenager whose symptoms of cancer were constantly dismissed as teenage 'grumpiness' has spoken of her sadness that she will never be able to have children. Amy Quinn, from Glasgow, began to feel tired and suffered from a constant pain in her left side from late 2011. But it took a year for doctors to diagnose a rare and aggressive form of ovarian cancer that had spread so much she needed her ovaries, fallopian tubes and appendix removed - leaving her infertile at 19. Scroll down for video . Amy Quinn began to feel tired and suffered from a constant pain in her side from late 2011. But doctors failed to take her symptoms seriously because of her age and she was only diagnosed with a rare form of ovarian cancer nearly a year later . She told MailOnline: ‘It wasn't easy convincing anyone I was ill. I had a pain in my left side that never seemed to go away. ‘I also felt tired all the time and started to give up things that I’d always loved, like dancing and musical theatre. 'I went to the doctor and explained but she dismissed me as being a grumpy teenager.' Over time, the pain got worse and worse and it got to the point where she couldn’t get out of bed. 'I was taking painkillers all the time but they didn’t help,' says Amy, now 20. 'I was also going to the loo more often – now I know that’s because the tumour was pressing on my bladder.' Treatment: After eventually being diagnosed, Amy began six months of chemotherapy in February and had lost all her hair within a month. Despite her gruelling treatment, she remained positive, pictured here with her grandmother having playfully stolen her wig . After five visits, her GP conceded . she might have a cyst. 'But I disagreed, says Amy. 'A cyst wouldn’t make . me feel so weird all the time, but she wouldn't listen. It was so . frustrating.’ ‘About . two years before, I’d had a Teenage Cancer Trust cancer awareness . session at school, so I knew I had to keep going back if the symptoms . persisted. Eventually as the pain got worse I . was sent for a scan which did show a mass, but I was still told it was a . cyst and nothing to worry about.’ Because . of the doctor’s lack of concern over her symptoms, Amy was marked down . as non-urgent and waited eight months for an operation to remove the . cyst. By the time the operation came round in November last year, she felt worse than ever: ‘I told the surgeon I had concerns, and for the first time someone listened to me. ‘Looking back, this conversation may have saved my life. The surgeon agreed to have an extra look about while he was in there.’ When she came round from the operation, the surgeon explained he had removed the cyst, but had also sent some other tissue for testing. ‘He told me it was most likely an infection,’ says Amy. But a few weeks later she was called for an urgent scan. ‘I said to my parents ""I think I have cancer"" but they thought I was being dramatic,’ recalls Amy. ‘But I just knew it – you know when you’re not well.’ The news that followed was . devastating. ‘The only words I remember the surgeon saying were “It’s . cancer” – I don't remember the rest of the meeting. I couldn’t speak and . I felt numb. How could this be happening to me? I was 19 and scared. I . felt really alone. Amy is now in remission and urging other teenagers not to ignore persistent symptoms such as extreme tiredness and pain . ‘But, on the other hand, it was a relief that I had finally got a diagnosis, having spent so long trying to convince everyone there was something wrong with me.' Doctors at Glasgow Royal Infirmary explained she would need further surgery, scheduled for New Year’s Eve:  ‘I was told the cancer was probably small because it hadn’t been picked up on the scan. They couldn't have been more wrong.’ Surgery had revealed Amy had a rare form of ovarian cancer called Low Grade Serous Carcinoma – and surgeons had been forced to remove her ovaries, fallopian tubes and appendix as it had spread so much. Surgeons were forced to remove Amy's ovaries, fallopian tubes and appendix as the cancer had spread so much. She is pictured singing at a Teenage Cancer Trust event . The radical surgery meant she had been thrown into the menopause at 19 and would never be able to have children. ‘It felt horrible to suddenly be infertile,’ says Amy. ‘I had always wanted to have a family one day and didn’t have time to save any eggs because my ovaries had been removed so suddenly. I remember just lying in the ward, crying. I can never conceive a child, which still hurts me. I also started my menopause at just 19, something else my friends wouldn't understand. In February this year, a month after surgery, Amy began six months of chemotherapy . ‘Chemo was difficult; I became very sick and fragile and a month later, I had no hair. ‘I have been a Christian for years and this really challenged my faith. I questioned how a caring God could do this to me. This time was hard for those closest to me too, but they helped me pull through. I kept my brave face on to please everyone around me. ‘One thing that really helped was having my chemo at the Teenage Cancer Trust unit at The Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre, where everyone is aged between 16 and 24. Amy has now finished her treatment and is in remission. ‘I am so pleased the treatment is over but I’m experiencing effects of the chemo now such as bowel problems.’ She firmly believes that had she been older, her symptoms would have been taken more seriously. ‘There’s no doubt in my mind that an older woman would have been tested for cancer. ‘I even remember my doctor saying I was too young to have it. I’ve met other people through the Teenage Cancer Trust who were told the same thing. Indeed, a report released by the Teenage Cancer Trust this week shows that over a third of young people with cancer (37 per cent) are diagnosed through admission to accident and emergency. This is nearly three times the number of adults diagnosed in this way. Of these young people, over a quarter . (26 per cent) had already been to see their GP with cancer symptoms. The . report also highlights that diagnosis through A&E is associated . with poorer outcomes and care. Amy is now back at university studying business and trying to get on with life. She is also passionate about raising awareness of teenage cancer symptoms. (Pictured with Alex Neil, Scottish Health Secretary) The five most common signs of cancer in young people aged 13 to 24 are persistent and unexplained: . Pain . Lump, bump or swelling . Significant weight loss . Extreme tiredness . Changes in a mole . Around seven young people aged 13 to 24 are diagnosed with cancer every day in the UK and more young people die as a result than any other disease. While it is accepted that early diagnosis leads to better outcomes in adults, cancer in young people is harder to diagnose because the signs are so similar to other less harmful problems. This means young people with cancer are frequently misdiagnosed with issues like infections, sports injuries and exam stress.

Police officers in a California town smashed a car window Sunday night to free a black bear that had locked itself into a Honda SUV, the latest episode in an apparent spree of trapped-bear incidents that has hit the area near the resort region of Lake Tahoe. The problem is proving to be region-wide as animal rights activists fighting to protect the local bear population allegedly branded Lake Tahoe business owners 'murderers' and 'executioners' for killing strays. Local police said the wandering bear caused substantial damage to the vehicle parked in the town of Truckee, near Lake Tahoe, and claimed officers broke the window because they couldn't locate the owner of the car. The latest incident, the third in just two weeks in the small town that sits on the Donner Pass, infamous for extreme winter weather, is the most-recent in a pattern of bear-related auto drama that has swept the Truckee area. This Black Bear was trapped in a Honda SUV in Truckee, California, near Lake Tahoe. Police smashed a window to rescue the stressed animal . 'There was major damage to all three of these vehicles,' Truckee police said in a statement. 'Imagine what a stressed, angry bear could do stuck in your car.' Last week, a bear stuck in a car parked in Truckee was released by the car's owner while the previous week saw another bear trapped in a car that broke a window to escape. 'Bears can and do open unlocked car doors,' police said. 'Never leave food or anything smelly in your car.' A photograph posted on the Facebook page 'Lake Tahoe Wall of Shame' shows dumped garbage that attracts bears . The recent incidents have highlighted an increasingly heated battle over bears between animal rights activists and game wardens on the California-Nevada border. Activists in Lake Tahoe are using aggressive strategies to keep California and Nevada game wardens from trapping bears that break into homes, businesses and campsites in search of food. Members of the Bear League, a grass-roots group that tries to educate people not to fear the animals and to keep better tabs on their trash, have started keeping vigils by traps and confronting the game wardens who set and check on them. 'They are just gorgeous creatures, and they are so misunderstood,' Carolyn Stark, a Bear League board member, told the Sacramento Bee. Starked helped maintain a . round-the-clock vigil at a trap recently set at an Incline Village home . where a female bear had twice broken into the garage. 'It’s so unfair,' said Stark. 'I want to help protect them.' While Truckee police advised local residents to refer to recommendations from the Bear League, . other activists have coated traps with Pine-Sol to deter bears and even . used teddy bears as decoys, the Sacremento Bee reported. An American Black Bear photographed in Mammoth Lakes, California, similar to those found in the Lake Tahoe region. This bear has climbed a tree for safety . A Facebook page called the Lake Tahoe Wall of Shame prints the addresses of places that have been careless with garbage bins or where traps are rumored to be imminent. Residents and business owners who have called wildlife officials to report bears on their property also have been caught in the crosshairs with anonymous threats and online slurs. John Brissenden, manager of Sorensen’s Resort, said employees were threatened after two bears were killed there last year. 'We were branded as murderers and executioners,' Brissenden said. 'It was alarming, discouraging, given our 40 years of protecting wildlife habitat, including bear habitat.' Bear League Executive Director Ann Bryant said her group only intervenes legally and does not endorse threats or trap-tampering. 'We are accused of all kinds of things,' Bryant said. 'People who don’t like bears don’t like us. We know that.' The combination of tactics has made property owners reluctant to call wildlife officials for assistance, Nevada Department of Wildlife director Tony Wasley said. 'We’ve had residences broken into by bears where the occupants made the statement that the people were more dangerous than the bears,' Wasley said. 'For that reason, they didn’t want a trap or, in one case, asked that the trap be removed.'","Third bear incident in two weeks as local cops break vehicle windows to free stuck bears .

Move towards the centre: Rachel Reeves, the new shadow work and pensions secretary, said Labour would be 'tougher' on welfare . Senior Labour figures were accused last night of shifting their rhetoric towards the centre ground – but without changing any of their policies. The debate centred on the key issues of free schools and welfare just days after leader Ed Miliband reshuffled his top team. Blairites were axed and replaced with more Left-wing  figures in what MPs hailed as a ‘new dawn for socialism’. But, in what appeared to be a bid to persuade voters the party has not lurched to the Left,  frontbenchers yesterday gave interviews suggesting a move towards the centre. Rachel Reeves, new shadow work and pensions spokesman, claimed that Labour would be ‘tougher’ on welfare than the Tories. She declared that claimants who turned down work would lose their benefits. Miss Reeves added: ‘We have some really great policies...that show we are tough and will not allow people to linger on benefits, but also that we are fair.’ This earned her a written rebuke from Iain Duncan Smith, who holds the post in Cabinet. He welcomed the change of tone but questioned if there had been any change of policy. ‘I was hoping you might explain exactly which of the many reforms you have personally voted against, you will now be in favour of?’ he said. ‘Will you reverse the benefit uprating limit? The housing benefit cap? The benefit cap?’ Tristram Hunt, new in the shadow . education role, appeared to reverse his previous dismissal of free . schools, which are set up by parents separate from local authority . control. The TV historian was asked in an interview about his earlier assessment that they were  a ‘vanity project for yummy mummies’. Shift: Tristram Hunt, the new shadow education secretary (left), appears to have reversed his position on free schools while Iain Duncan Smith (right) welcomed the change of tone but questioned any change in policy . He . replied: ‘I regret those comments because any parents, be they yummy . mummies or faddy daddies, involved in the education of their children is . great.’ A Labour government would not close any free schools and would back parent-led academies, he pledged. Mr Hunt said that there could be no return to all state schools being run by local authorities. He added he would happily send his children to a free school. ‘If you want to do that when we are in government, we will be on your side,’ he said. ‘There has been this perception that we would not be, and I want people to be clear that we are.’ But Mr Hunt later emphasised there were important differences between free schools and Labour’s parent-led academies, which would have to employ qualified teachers and could not be set up in areas with enough school places. Despite his latest comments, a party source insisted that there had been no policy change.","Senior party figures were accused of shifting towards the centre ground .

Stunned: Lucy Elliot, now 31, was amazed that a message in a bottle she wrote and threw out to sea while on holiday in Looe, Cornwall (a holiday photo pictured in her hand) in 1994 was found in Norway recently . Treasure not trash: Incredibly, Kurt Johnny Haaland found the message in a bottle (pictured) while walking along the coast in Norway and prised the bottle open to reveal the faded letter . Mr Haaland was amazed when he prised the message out of the plastic bottle and found it had been written by a girl named Lucy Elliot, who wrote that she lived in Tile Hill, Coventry and had ‘brown thick wavy hair’. He said: ‘My wife and I went for a walk a few weeks ago. We live on the south-west coast of Norway and like to go for walks along the coast.

The full-time mother living in Woodford Halse, Northamptonshire, said: ‘I can remember writing the letter like it was yesterday. ‘I had lost my bracelet and was pacing up and down the beach trying to find it. ‘I got bored eventually so decided to write this message in a bottle and threw it into the sea. ‘When .

Green Party MP Caroline Lucas yesterday denied two public order offences following a mass protest at a potential fracking site. The MP for Brighton Pavilion was one of 25 people arrested among hundreds protesting outside the Cuadrilla drilling platform in Balcombe, West Sussex, on August 19. Miss Lucas, 52, is alleged to have failed to comply with a condition made by a senior police officer under the Public Order Act and obstructed the road to the site. Wearing a grey dress and plum-coloured cardigan, she smiled as she entered the dock at Crawley Magistrates’ Court before confirming her name, age and address. A handful of supporters, including former glamour model turned politician Marina Baker listened to proceedings at the back of the court. She pleaded not guilty at Crawley Magistrates’ Court and was released on unconditional bail until her trial next year. Speaking outside court, Miss Lucas said: ‘By joining the peaceful protest I wanted to actively oppose the exploitation of yet more fossil fuels.’ Critics of fracking, in which water and chemicals are pumped into the ground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release gas, fear it could harm water resources and cause small earthquakes, and development of the sites will harm the countryside. Cuadrilla has since completed its exploratory oil drilling and left the village after more than two months of operations which involved the drilling of a vertical exploration well to a depth of 2,720ft, collecting 294ft of rock samples. Protests: Police were brought in to escort a tanker to the site in West Sussex . Arrests: 25 people were arrested following a mass protest at the fracking site in Balcombe on August 19 . Designer Vivian Westwood gave her support to the protestors at the fracking site at Balcombe in West Sussex . The energy firm also confirmed the presence of hydrocarbons, which can be used for fuel, and said it would apply for planning permission to carry out further testing to determine flow rates. Sussex Police said the overall cost of the operation, which saw 400 officers at peak periods patrol the area over three months and 125 people arrested, is estimated at about £4 million. Sussex Crime Commissioner Katy Bourne has applied to the Home Office for financial support to meet the additional cost of policing and drafting in officers from 10 other forces, describing Balcombe as ‘a national issue’.

Diet Coke, the second-most popular soft drink in the country, may be losing some of its pop. During a conference call with analysts Tuesday, a Coca-Cola executive noted that the soda brand was 'under a bit of pressure' because of people's concerns over its ingredients, alluding to the growing wariness of artificial sweeteners in recent years. Steve Cahillane, who heads Coca-Cola's North American and Latin American business, noted that the issue wasn't specific to Diet Coke, but that many diet foods and drinks in the U.S. are facing the same concerns. Losing its appeal? Diet Coke, the second-most popular soft drink in the country, is 'under pressure' due to people's concerns over its 'unnatural' ingredients . 'We believe very strongly in the future of Diet Coke,' Mr Cahillane nevertheless stressed, noting that the drink was still the number two soda in the U.S, after knocking Pepsi from that perch in 2010. The company still sells twice as much regular Coke as Diet Coke. Mr Cahillane also noted that the company is investing in boosting Diet Coke's performance, pointing to recent promotions with singer Taylor Swift as an example. Soda has been under fire from health advocates for several years now, and Americans have been cutting back on sugary fizz for some time. But in a somewhat newer development, diet sodas are falling at a faster rate than regular sodas, according to Beverage Digest, an industry tracker. Last year, for example, sales volume for Coke fell one per cent, while Diet Coke fell three per cent. Pepsi fell 3.4per cent, while Diet Pepsi fell 6.2per cent. Those figures aren't going unnoticed in Coca-Cola's Atlanta headquarters. This summer, the company launched its first ad addressing the safety of aspartame to ease concerns people might have. It has also distributed fact sheets on the topic to its bottlers and retailers who sell Coke products. Aware of the shift: Coca-Cola is now working on producing sodas made with natural, low-calorie sweeteners . The Food and Drug Administration says aspartame may be safely used in foods as a sweetener, and the American Cancer Society has said that most studies using people have found that aspartame is not linked to an increased risk of cancer. Still, the broader trend in the U.S. has been toward foods and drinks people feel are natural or organic. And Coca-Cola is clearly aware of the shift; the company is working on producing sodas made with natural, low-calorie sweeteners. It also launched a version of its namesake drink sweetened with stevia in Argentina this summer. Stevia comes from a plant of the same name. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola said that sales volume for regular, full-calorie Coke rose two per cent in North America in its latest quarterly results reported on Tuesday. Coke Zero, which is made with artificial sweeteners and targeted more toward men, rose five percent. The company didn't break out Diet Coke's performance, but overall soda volume for the region was flat.","A Coca-Cola executive says the .

Thousands of schools are expected to face disruption today as teachers strike in a row over pay, pensions and working conditions. Pupils in the North East and Cumbria, the South West, South East and London - will be affected by the industrial action which has been organised by the National Union of Teachers and the NASUWT. The Government has condemned the move, saying it is 'disappointed' that the unions have decided to strike. Members of NUT and NASUWT marched earlier this month, during a one day strike by thousands of teachers across four English regions about pay, pensions and working conditions . NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said that the 'overwhelming majority' of teachers in each of these areas would be on strike. She said: 'No teacher has any wish to inconvenience parents or disrupt pupils' education, but this action is not the failure or due to the unreasonableness of teachers. 'It is the failure and unreasonableness of the Secretary of State, who day-in-day-out is disrupting the education of children and young people through his attacks on the teaching profession.' Chris Keates of the NASUWT . A Department for Education spokeswoman said: 'It is disappointing that the NUT and NASUWT are striking over the Government's measures to allow heads to pay good teachers more. 'In a recent poll, 61 percent of respondents supported linking teachers' pay to performance and 70 percent either opposed the strikes or believed that teachers should not be allowed to strike at all. 'All strikes will do is disrupt parents' lives, hold back children's education and damage the reputation of the profession.' The dispute focuses on three key issues - pay, pensions and conditions. Unions are opposed to Government plans to allow schools to set teachers' salaries, linked to performance in the classroom, and argue that pensions changes will leave their members working longer, paying in more and receiving less when they retire. They also accuse the Government of attacking their working conditions, including introducing reforms that will allow schools to have longer school days and longer terms. The first regional walkout took place in the North West on June 27, and further strikes took place in East of England, the East Midlands, West Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside on October 1. Plans for a national one-day walkout before Christmas have also been announced by the two unions. Research published earlier this month revealed that the UK public think teachers should be paid around 15 percent more than their current salaries, while almost three-quarters (74%) were in favour of performance-related pay for teachers. The findings, part of the Varkey GEMS Foundation Global Teacher Status Index, also revealed that the UK was split over the influence unions should have in teachers' pay and conditions. More than 40 percent said they had too little influence, and just under 30 percent said they had too much.","Teachers from four regions go on strike over pay, pensions and conditions .

It is believed around 200 people have been put to death in Iran since its new president Hassan Rouhani came to power in June . A death row prisoner in Iran is to be hanged for a second time once he 'becomes well again' after he survived an initial bungled execution. The 37-year-old man named as Alireza M was 'put to death' in the Islamic regime's Bojnourd prison last Wednesday for drugs offences. After 12 minutes, he was certified as dead and taken to the prison morgue. But when his family went to collect his body the following day, they noticed he was still breathing and rushed him to hospital. One family member told Iran's state-run media: 'When we were told the death sentence had been carried out, we went to collect his body to prepare for a memorial service. 'But when we went to the coroner's office we found him alive again, which made his two daughters very happy.' Once officials were told Alireza M had survived, they put him under armed guard at the hospital to await a second execution. A judiciary official told the state media: 'The verdict was the death sentence, and it will be carried out once the man gets well again.' Iran has executed an estimated 560 people this year - including around 200 that have been put to death since new 'moderate' president Hassan Rouhani came to power in June. Rouhani vowed to end the repression of the previous regime, but human rights groups have said executions have actually increased under his rule.

Brown Labrador-spaniel cross Arthur became 'spaced out' and then depressed after accidentally eating a lump of cannabis . A mischievous dog became 'spaced out' and depressed after accidentally eating a lump of cannabis while on a walk. Brown Labrador-spaniel cross Arthur . bounded off across the field and started eating something, believed to be a cake laced with the drug, in the field . while on walk with owner Emma Butterfield. Ms Butterfield, 40, thought nothing of it until her dog started to shake, look dazed and struggled to stand up. Her partner Joe Lepper, 41, rushed the six-year-old dog to the vets where he was described as being 'intoxicated'. He stopped shaking at the vets, but started to look more 'spaced-out', slowly leaning over and began to drift off. Mr Lepper, from Street, Somerset, said: . 'Arthur had darted off because he saw something on the ground, which . isn’t unusual, and ate it. 'But about an hour or two later, when Emma brought him home he started looking very dazed, confused and couldn’t walk. 'He was really wobbly and when we put his food out for him he wouldn’t touch it, which is unusual. 'At that stage we didn’t think that he . was stoned, but on reflection, he was giving all the hallmarks of being a . very stoned dog. 'The vet was fairly convinced that he had taken some kind of drug and that he was stoned.' Arthur was taken to Orchard Veterinary Group, in Glastonbury, Somerset, where he was seen by vet Niall Taylor. Mr Taylor said: 'When I saw him first he . walked into the consulting room fine, but he was indeed shaking like a . leaf, it’s no wonder they were worried. Arthur started to shake, looked dazed and struggled to stand up after eating the drug . 'I checked him over and he looked a bit . flushed, with red gums. The most striking thing about the examination . was his incredible low temperature - several degrees below normal, . something only usually seen in severe shock. 'But strangely he seemed fine, with no . sign of shock. I even checked by using a second thermometer. His heart . rate was also extremely slow. 'It was beginning to dawn on me that . this was a possible intoxication. The trouble is that we had no idea of . how much he’d had or of exactly what, although I strongly suspected . marijuana, given the circumstances. 'Probably in some sort of sweet cake, hence the reason he was so keen to eat it.' Mr Lepper was given strict instructions . to keep a close eye on Arthur overnight but despite his condition . getting better his mood worsened and he spiralled into depression. Mr Lepper said: 'Arthur is usually a very happy dog, full of energy and friendly. But after he’d eaten what ever it was that he ate he was very depressed that night. Joe Lepper rushed the dog to the vets after he started to look dazed. The dog has now been given a clean bill of health .

'He was sad all night and even a little . in the morning but eventually as it worked its way out of his system he . was back to his normal, happy self.' A check-up at the vets the next day gave . the dog a clean bill of health, but the dog's owners are now urging . others to keep an eye while walking their pets. Marijuana is toxic to dogs and cats, and symptoms can be severe and life-threatening if not treated promptly.","Arthur ran across field and started eating something while on a walk .

Nick Boles suggested newspapers should refuse to co-operate with a new Royal Charter enshrining a newspaper watchdog . One of David Cameron’s closest ministerial allies has attacked plans to regulate the 300-year-old free Press. Nick Boles suggested newspapers should refuse to co-operate with a new Royal Charter enshrining a newspaper watchdog. They should also mount a legal challenge to the way the Government has handled the issue. The remarks by the planning minister, a member of the Prime Minister’s inner circle, are by far the strongest criticism from a member of the Government of a cross-party deal imposing a new system of regulation on the industry. Mr Boles said of the Royal Charter on Press regulation, published last week: ‘There’s nothing we’ve done that troubles me as much as this.’ He said the best argument Culture Secretary Maria Miller could muster to justify it was that Labour and the Liberal Democrats were threatening to join forces to push through something more draconian. Mr Boles also launched a strong attack on his Lib Dem Coalition colleagues, saying their stance was ‘completely amazing’ from a party that likes ‘spouting guff about liberalism’. He added: ‘One of the strands that connects Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher and modern Conservatives is freedom under the rule of law. We do not believe in freedom under the watchful eye and wagging finger of a state-sponsored regulator.’ The minister’s remarks, in an interview with the ConservativeHome website, cast serious doubt on the future of the cross-party plan and suggest it does not command support at the top of government. The Government has passed legislation meaning that newspapers that refuse to join a new regulator will be hit with ‘exemplary’ damages in privacy and other cases. However, senior figures including Lord . Lester, an eminent QC who is the architect of reforms to Britain’s . notorious libel laws, have suggested that will violate Article 10 of the . European Convention on Human Rights, which protects freedom of . expression. Last week, the . three main parties finally agreed the detail of a Royal Charter setting . up a system of newspaper regulation in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry . into media standards. 'One of the strands that connects Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher and modern Tories is freedom under the rule of law. 'We do not believe in freedom under the wagging finger of a state-sponsored regulator,' Nick Boles, Planning Minister . An alternative proposal by the Press, . which would have given an independent regulator strong investigative . powers and the right to impose fines of up to £1million, up-front . corrections, with inaccuracies corrected fully and prominently, and . independence from the industry and politicians, was rejected. It . is thought to be the first time that the Queen has been asked to sign a . Royal Charter imposing a system of regulation on an unwilling industry. Mr . Boles said that the strongest argument put by Mrs Miller was ‘that if . it didn’t go through, Labour and the Liberal Democrats would do . something much worse through explicit statutory legislation’. He . added: ‘If you ask yourself a simple question “Would a . Conservative-only government be doing this?”, I think the answer is . unquestionably “No”.’ He said the proposal ‘does not compel any publisher of any news publication to co-operate with it. All it does is create this [pressure to co-operate] through the punitive damages. So there is absolutely no legal reason why any publisher needs to play along with it.’ Mr Boles went on to suggest that the use of the Privy Council, a ministerial body which advises the Queen, and the Royal prerogative to impose the regime was a ‘pretty big constitutional innovation’ and suggested the Press should challenge it. He likened the use of the Privy Council and the Royal prerogative to ‘Alice in Wonderland’. Three out of four voters believe there is a risk that future governments would use a legal system of press regulation to try to stop newspapers from criticising them. A YouGov poll for the Sun also found that 45 per cent agree it is vital that a free press is protected. He said it would be ‘very reasonable’ for the Press to want to ‘establish whether each and every one of the steps that has been undertaken to set up these structures has been properly undertaken’. ‘This is a very, very big constitutional innovation, using a mechanism that is itself a pretty arcane piece of constitutional machinery.’ He added that by their behaviour over Press freedom, the Lib Dems have shown that they are not liberal. ‘What I find completely amazing is how they can carry on spouting guff about Gladstone and liberalism…while co-operating with statist Labour to try to bring in a much more draconian system of state regulation of the Press.’ The editor of the New York Times has said she would ‘probably not sign up’ to a charter for state regulation. Jill Abramson, arguably the most powerful Press figure outside the UK, also said US journalists had more freedom than their counterparts here. ‘The Press in Britain has more restrictions on it than we do,’ she told BBC’s Newsnight.","Planning Minister Nick Boles says newspapers should refuse to co-operate with Royal Charter enshrining a newspaper watchdog .

A government minister grew so fed up with Whitehall’s ‘clunky and rubbish’ IT systems he had his own personal wi-fi network installed. Francis Maude became frustrated at the time it took to log on to government systems and wanted to use his iPad instead. But the Cabinet Office minister was astonished to find that a multi-million contract signed by the Labour government did not include providing a easy wireless web access usually found in coffee shops. Frustration: Cabinet Office Francis Maude, pictured in his Whitehall office, demanded wi-fi be installed so he could use his iPad and bypass cumbersome government systems . He now wants almost all civil servants to use ‘off the shelf’ computers and mobile phones to cut costs and speed up the way they work. The coalition has grown increasingly irritated with the way Whitehall buys and uses technology. A study found civil servants waste the equivalent of three days a year waiting for their computers to turn on. Mr Maude was forced to take matters into his own hands when he could not get his phone or iPad to work in his Whitehall office. He refused to use a high security . computer issued by contractors under the Labour deal because it involved . entering numerous passwords and could not use it to surf the internet . properly. Farce: IT systems in different departments are not compatible so officials have to dash around Whitehall carrying printouts of emails . Instead he had a wi-fi system . installed in his office overlooking Horse Guards Parade so he can . by-pass government systems and use his iPad to go online. A source close to Mr Maude said: ‘He got wi-fi so he can use the internet on his own machine. ‘When we came into government everybody in the Cabinet Office was using encrypted laptops which cost £7,000-a-year to run. ‘You can buy several good machines off the shelf for that. This was under a contract signed by the last government. ‘What were Labour doing signing up to an IT contract which didn’t include wi-fi?’ Sensitive: A document detailing on what days different milk was bought for civil servants to make tea and coffee was marked 'restricted' by over-zealous security officials . It is understood the contract is due to expire soon and Mr Maude is demanding it be dramatically rewritten. In . June Stephen Kelly, the Government's new chief operating officer, . revealed his frustrations with Whitehall’s IT: 'I came into the office . and I pressed my PC and it took me seven minutes to boot up. 'That's government in the old world, that's three days of the year I waste of my time booting up,' the Standard reported. 'I think the average cost of a desktop [computer] a year is about £6,000. You could go and buy 10 iPads a year.' The changes emerged as Mr Maude announced changes to the security classification of documents in a bid to improve communication and save millions of pounds.

In an open letter, the former videographer, laments: 'I behaved badly'. In fact, she feels so terribly in the wrong, Hunter writes, that today an updated version of her 2012 memoir is published 'annotating all of my regrets and mistakes'.

She said sorry to his late wife Elizabeth, who was dying of cancer while they carried out the affair, and his children . Hunter, who has a five-year-old daughter Quinn from her affair with Edwards, also said sorry to John and Elizabeth's children and the voters who once supported Edwards as North Carolina senator and in his bid for the White House. In a hand-wringing, confessional piece in the Huffington Post, Hunter writes: 'Unfortunately, I was not thinking about anyone but myself. 'I was selfish. I fell in love with John Edwards and wanted to be with him and that desire trumped everything else.' Hunter explains that she regrets having written a book about her scandalous affair with Edwards in 2004. Hunter says that she feels 'horrible' about the mistakes that she made in her book so has now published an . 'annotated' version, marking out exactly where she went wrong. The 'explosive tell-all' was published last July but sold just 6,000 copies despite a media blitz.

A women’s basketball player who left the College of the Holy Cross is suing the school over allegations of emotional, physical and verbal abuse from the team’s head coach. Ashley Cooper, 20, played two seasons under long time head coach Bill Gibbons, 66, before giving up a full scholarship and leaving after complaints of him striking and shouting at players went unanswered by school administrators. Filed in Manhattan because Ms Cooper now attends New York University, the lawsuit against the Worcester, MA., based school seeks compensation for tuition and expenses at NYU, as well as other unspecified damages, according to ABC News. She had a full ride: Holy Cross' Ashley Cooper (left) says she fled the school to escape the abuse from coach Gibbons documented in the lawsuit . Ms Cooper told ABC News she no longer plays collegiate basketball after fleeing the 28-year, 533-win coach’s abuse. ‘I don't want this to happen to anyone else ever again,’ Ms Cooper told ABC News. ‘I want to stop it. I'm doing this for other people. I'm taking a stand for others, for every freshman that walks through the door.’ The Colts Neck, NJ native told ABC of the coach screaming in her face and other abuse. The lawsuit, according to ABC, says Mr Gibbons’ ‘actions constitute the worst type of bullying because not only is defendant Gibbons her coach and supervisor, but also he is someone she is supposed to respect.’ The coach ‘violently yanked and pulled Cooper by her shirt collar and strongly squeezed the back of her neck causing pain while barking instructions in her face at close range,’ the suit claims, according to the New York Post. Acting in an ‘outrageous manner in his yelling, ranting, screaming and hysterics,’ the coach once struck Ms Cooper so hard he left a hand print that didn’t immediately go away, court papers cited by ABC claim. As a result of behavior exceeding ‘the misconduct involving former Rutgers men's basketball coach Mike Rice,’ leading to ‘fear of physical pain,’ according to the lawsuit, she had no choice but to leave the school. Accused abuser:: Holy Cross head coach Bill Gibbons faces allegations of physical, emotional and verbal abuse in the suit . Players on opposing teams would often console Holy Cross players after a belittling at the hands of the abusive coach, Ms Cooper told ABC. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie famously said Coach Rice’s conduct was ‘completely unacceptable’ because it violated ‘the trust those parents put in Rutgers University,’ the Post noted. Mr Rice lost his coaching job as a result of the behavior. Mr Gibbons also  ‘struck another female player on the back’ last season, resulting in a complaint from the girl’s father to the school that was ignored, Ms Cooper told ABC. A message left at Mr Gibbons home by MailOnline seeking comment was not returned. When reached by ABC News, the coach hung up. Picturesque: Holy Cross College. in Worcester, MA., has a beautiful campus . Holy Cross emailed the following statement to MailOnline. ‘The physical, mental and emotional well-being of our students is our highest priority at Holy Cross. We just received the lawsuit and are in the process of reviewing it.’ ‘Ms. Cooper had brought her concern to the college and we investigated at that time. The lawsuit we received today includes a series of new allegations and we will now bring in outside counsel to review them.’ Athletic Director Richard Regan has been critical of a coach’s conduct in the past as a member of an NCAA committee that chided the University of New Mexico’s men’s soccer coach and goalkeeper. ‘We believe the championship is discredited by the unsportsmanlike actions of these coaches and expect all coaches to conduct themselves in a manner befitting the championship,’ he said at the time, according to ABC.

A bill awarding compensation to the victims of Cleveland kidnapper and rapist Ariel Castro is set to be voted on this week by the Ohio legislature. Kidnapped, held prisoner, abused and raped for about a decade by the madman, Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight would receive $25,000 for each year they were held if the bill is voted into law. The money would come from  the Ohio Court of Claims’ victims of crime fund, according to the Cleveland Plain-Dealer.

Under those guidelines, Ms Knight would receive $275,000, Ms Berry $250,000 and Ms DeJesus $225,000. Local officials are also looking for a federal waiver to grant the victims Medicaid for life, according to the paper. Should the three women decide to go to school, the state would pay their tuition and living expenses if they enrolled in a state university or college, the paper said. News of the reparations comes only two weeks after Mr Castro was found dead in the Ohio jail cell to which he was sentenced to serve 1,000 years.

The bill is being brought to the Ohio Assembly by John Barnes (R-Cleveland), who wants the state government to provide assistance to anyone held in captivity for eight years or more, according to the paper. ‘The proposal isn't a giveaway but rather an opportunity for three women to build a better future by giving them access to an education and other life experiences,’ Mr Barnes told the paper. ‘We are merely trying to restore what they lost as a result of their involuntary servitude,’ he added.","The compensation is part of a new law applying to anyone held captive eight years or more .

Newark Mayor Cory Booker has been elected as the new Senator for New Jersey after winning  a special election Wednesday night. The win now gives the rising Democratic star a bigger political stage after beating conservative Steve Lonegan, a former small-town mayor. With nearly all precincts reporting, Booker had 55 per cent of the vote to Lonegan's 44 per cent. Scroll down for video . Next stop, Washington: Cory Booker has been elected as the next Senator of New Jersey . The first reaction from the social-media savvy victor came, of course, on Twitter: 'Thank you so much, New Jersey, I'm proud to be your Senator-elect.' In a speech later to supporters in Newark, Booker spoke, as he often does, of the unity of the American people. 'That's why I'm going to Washington - to take back that sense of pride. Not to play shallow politics that's used to attack and divide but to engage in the kind of hard, humble service that reaches out to others,' he said. Booker also told of how his father, who died last week at 76, taught him about love and hard work, values he says he'll carry to the Senate. Booker, 44, will become the first black senator from New Jersey and heads to Washington with an unusual political resume. He . was raised in suburban Harington Park as the son of two of the first . black IBM executives, and graduated from Stanford and law school at Yale . with a stint in between as a Rhodes Scholar before moving to one of . Newark's toughest neighborhoods with the intent of doing good. Big win: Booker, seen here with his mother Carolyn, mentioned his father in his acceptance speech following his death last week . Moving on up: Booker is seen as a rising star in the Democratic party and this win will propel him to a more national stage after raising his profile within New Jersey after working as the mayor of Newark . He's been an unconventional . politician, a vegetarian with a Twitter following of 1.4 million - or . five times the population of the city he governs. With . dwindling state funding, he has used private fundraising, including a . $100million pledge from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, to run . programs in Newark, a strategy that has brought his city resources and . him both fame and criticism. Booker was elected to complete the 15 . months remaining on the term of Frank Lautenberg, whose death in June at . age 89 gave rise to an unusual and abbreviated campaign. If . he wants to keep the seat for a full six-year term - and all . indications are that he does - Booker will be on the ballot again in . November 2014. Wide margin: He got 55 per cent of the vote compared to his competitor's 44 per cent . Governor Chris Christie, a Republican with a national following of his own, appointed his attorney general, Jeffrey Chiesa, to the Senate temporarily and scheduled a special election for a Wednesday just 20 days before Christie himself is on the ballot seeking re-election. Christie said he wanted to give voters a say as soon as legally possible. Democrats challenged the timing, saying Christie was afraid of appearing on the same ballot as the popular Booker but the courts upheld the governor's election schedule. Booker had a running start on the election. Before Lautenberg died, Booker passed up a chance to run against Christie this year, saying he was eyeing Lautenberg's seat in 2014, in part so he could complete a full term as mayor - something he won't do now that he's heading to Washington. He won an August primary against an experienced Democratic field including two members of Congress and the speaker of the state Assembly in a campaign that was largely about ideas. The general election was about deeper contrasts, both ideological and personal. Lonegan stepped down as New Jersey director of the anti-tax, pro-business Americans for Prosperity to run. Lonegan, who is legally blind, got national attention as mayor of the town of Bogota when he tried to get English made its official language. After two runs in Republican . gubernatorial primaries and as the leader of successful campaigns . against ballot measures to raise a state sales tax and fund stem-cell . research, Lonegan was a favorite of New Jersey's relatively small right . wing. Gathered with . supporters Wednesday evening in Bridgewater, he said, 'Unfortunately for . whatever reason the message we delivered together ... did not win the . day.' Democratic influencers: State Senator Barbara Buono (left) is running against current Governor Chris Christie in his bid to get re-elected . Lonegan, who has twice sought his party's nomination for governor, told The Associated Press he has no plans to challenge Booker again next year or seek any elected office again. Booker does not expect to be sworn in until close to the end of the month, an aide said, noting the results still need to be certified by the state. When he steps down as mayor of New Jersey's largest city, the council will be able to appoint an interim mayor. The two candidates had portrayed each other as too extreme for the job. Throughout the campaign, Lonegan was aggressive, criticizing Booker during a string of homicides in Newark, holding a red carpet event in rally to mock the time Booker spent fundraising in California and declaring that 'New Jersey needs a leader, not a tweeter.' Lonegan also criticized Booker when a Portland, Oregon stripper revealed a series of not-so-salacious Twitter messages she'd exchanged with Booker, who's single. Looking nationally: Chris Christie, seen here at a debate against Buono, is also a popular New Jersey politician who has publicly expressed higher aspirations and is seen as a possible presidential candidate in 2016 . The topic resurfaced last week when Lonegan fired a key adviser after a profane interview in which the adviser suggested Booker's words were 'like what a gay guy would say to a stripper.' Lonegan had called it 'strange' that Booker won't say whether he's gay. Booker, for his part, has said his sexuality should not matter to voters and has been elusive on the subject. At a debate this month, Lonegan responded to Booker's comments about the need for environmental regulations to clean a river through Newark. 'You may not be able to swim in that river,' he said. 'But it's probably, I think, because of all the bodies floating around of shooting victims in your city.' Booker seemed stunned at the remark, and his campaign has criticized Lonegan for it.","The popular mayor of Newark is now a member of the Senate .

It could be a scene from an action movie - if you ignore the tie flapping awkwardly under the seat belt. Boris Johnson clung on to a helicopter as it flew with its doors open over Hong Kong in an unlikely recreation of the film Apocalypse Now. The London Mayor took to the skies as he again made a pitch for a new airport in London, warning the David Cameron and George Osborne are ‘kidding themselves’ if they think Britain can compete internationally without one. Action hero: Boris Johnson takes a dramatic helicopter ride over Hong Kong as he arrive in the city on day 5 of a trade mission to China . Mr Johnson called on the UK Government to follow the example of Hong Kong, overcome its doubts, and give the green light to a new airport. The Mayor pointed to Chek Lap Kok airport, an engineering marvel built on land reclaimed from the sea - much like the Mayor's plans for a so-called ‘Boris island’ - as an example of what could be achieved with a new airport to the east of London. Looking out over its two runways, Mr Johnson claimed the situation in Hong Kong in the early 1990s when the old urban airport had no room for expansion was similar to the one currently facing Britain with a third Heathrow runway a controversial and, he claims, unworkable option. The Mayor warned that there was a risk of a ‘convulsive heave’ from the British Establishment that would end with the ‘catastrophic’ building of a third Heathrow runway but said Mr Osborne's attitude to big infrastructure projects like high-speed rail indicated he might be persuaded to build a new airport. Making waves: The London Mayor's trip to China has risked overshadowing George Osborne who has also been in the country this week . High flier: Mr Johnson used his trip to renew his call for a new airport serving London and the south east of England . Chancellor Mr Osborne was due to land in Hong Kong shortly after Mr Johnson as the pair come to the end of their separate trade missions to China. Looking out over the misty bay in Hong Kong, Mr Johnson told reporters: ‘I do think there is a risk that what's going to happen basically is that at the end of this year they're going to keep the Heathrow third runway option in the mix, there will then be an election and there will then be one last convulsive heave by the Treasury and by the CBI and the British Establishment generally to impose another runway on west London and that would be absolutely catastrophic. ‘People say that's the only thing we can do in the short-term, actually in reality that won't be delivered, even if you got going now on the third runway it wouldn't be until 2028 and you'd be massively compounding the economic damage in west London. ‘Why not get it right from the off as they have in Hong Kong? Why not take the long-term decision? Think long-term, that is what we should be doing.’ Landing: Mr Johnson hit back at reports a senior Cabinet minister had dismissed his dream of a brand new hub airport being built . He went on: ‘There is a recidivist instinct in the Treasury and the CBI amongst people.’ Asked if it was shared by the Chancellor, he said: ‘I don't think so. I think if you look at the Chancellor's record, his personal commitment to big infrastructure projects such as HS2, I think in principle he could well be on for it. ‘I think the trouble is that there are a large number of people in the Treasury and elsewhere who basically think 'little old us, we can't do something like that, we can't compete with China in that way' and I think that is negative, I think that doesn't show sufficient ambition for this country.’ Mr Johnson wants a four-runway airport either built in the Thames Estuary on an island reclaimed from the sea or on the Isle of Grain in Kent's Hoo Peninsula - as outlined by architect Lord Foster. Another option would involve expanding Stansted to make it a four-runway airport. Touchdown: Mr Johnson said Chinese investment in big projects proved his ambitions were right for the future . The Mayor said a new airport would serve the country for generations to come. He said: ‘At the moment we in London are losing business to other European airports, our business people cannot get off to these mainland Chinese destinations. ‘One thing that has really come through to me loud and clear in the last few days is that if you have the will and the determination you can do it. ‘I was amazed to hear somebody in Government say we can't possibly build a new airport, that's a kind of Chinese thing to do. ‘Well, the Chinese are showing us that that is the approach we have got to have in the future. ‘Aviation accounts for about 60 per cent of Hong Kong's economic output at the moment and if we followed this route we would not only be solving a critical noise pollution problem in west London, but we would also be creating a logistics hub that would serve our city, our country, for generations to come.’","London Mayor flies into city to make pitch for a new London airport .

A woman died of heart failure after waiting more than an hour for an ambulance, an inquest heard. The family of former Christian missionary Nicolette Clarke, 49, made desperate 999 calls to London Ambulance Service as they watched her deteriorate until her heart stopped on September 17 last year. They were repeatedly told no ambulances were available. A boss at the ambulance service told the hearing that response times had become slower and there was a national shortage of paramedics. Former Christian missionary Nicolette Clarke died after waiting more than an hour for an ambulance. Her family made desperate 999 calls to London Ambulance Service as they watched deteriorate until her heart stopped . Miss Clarke’s family say they have been left feeling let down by the authorities in the wake of her death. Miss Clarke lived with her mother and sister in Worcester Park, south west London, and suffered from diabetes that caused a kidney infection in August last year. She was discharged from hospital but complained of nausea and a lack of appetite. Her sister found her in bed at 11.45pm on September 16. She told the inquest, held at Westminster Coroner’s Court on Friday, Miss Clarke looked 'pale and grey' and said she was not feeling well. She gave her two doses of insulin but her condition did not improve so, at midnight, her mother called 999. Miss Clarke was put in the C1 category, which LAS aims to attend within 20 minutes, although this standard is only achieved in around 65 per cent of cases. After 30 minutes, her mother called 999 again to find out where the ambulance was - but was told one had not been dispatched because of high demand.The case was not reclassified after the second call as her condition had not changed. However, by midnight Miss Clarke had lost consciousness so a third call was made to 999 - but she was still not reclassified. It was not until 1.19am that a paramedic arrived at the scene - by which time Miss Clarke’s heart had stopped. She was taken to hospital but died on September 28 because of damage her brain sustained while her heart was not beating. The inquest heard if the ambulance had . met its target time, Miss Clarke would have arrived at hospital as her . heart stopped. Miss Clarke was described as mischievous, very caring, loving, creative and artistic . Although there is no data for survival rates following . cardiac arrests in ambulances, it is accepted that survival rates are . increased among those whose hearts stop in hospital. Dr Fionna Moore, medical director at London Ambulance Service, said: 'It has become apparent that we give a poorer response time in the last 12 months - our staff are exceptionally highly utilised. 'It means there are always calls waiting for ambulances. Four years ago we thought we were busy if we had 900 category A [the most critical] calls in a day. This weekend we had 1,400 on each day. There is a national shortage of paramedics.' Coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe said: 'Even if the ambulance had come earlier, there is no way we can say she would have had a different outcome. Yes, she would have had more specialist help on hand but the survival rates following cardiac arrest are still poor.” She recorded a narrative verdict, referencing ambulance delays and Miss Clarke’s health problems. But she said it was not for her to investigate the state of the ambulance service and suggested people contact their MPs to call for increased funding. Following the hearing, Miss Clarke’s sister Debby said: 'I feel let down. We’re not out here for compensation or anything like that, we just want things to change but it doesn’t feel like that’s going to happen. Everyone just seems to have accepted what happened. 'Nicky was a person who would do anything for anyone. She was mischievous, had a wonderful sense of humour, was very caring, loving, creative and artistic. 'When she needed help, after helping others so selflessly, it just seemed that no one was available to help her in her time of need. 'We were always extremely close. She was not just my sister, but my very best friend. As a family, the three of us have gone through some very hard times but we stuck together and helped each other through them all. We feel incomplete without her.'","Nicolette Clarke's family called an ambulance after she looked 'pale and grey'

The parents of a severely brain-damaged girl blew her £2.6million compensation on a lavish lifestyle, a court has heard. Cathy Watson and her husband Robert Hills allegedly used the money to buy sports cars, jewellery, property and racking up huge credit card bills. The couple allegedly pocketed £500,000 over an eight-year period that was set aside for Cathy’s daughter Samantha Svendsen, Doncaster Crown Court heard. Payout: Cathy Watson, left, and Robert Hills, right, 'behaved as if they had won the lottery' after Cathy's daughter Samantha Svendsen received the payout, the court was told . The girl, who is now aged 29, was given a payout in December 1999 after the NHS admitted medical negligence leaving her with cerebral palsy. Jurors were told Samantha's mother and stepfather behaved 'as though they had won the lottery'. Watson, now 44, was given £270,000 to cover expenses she had already incurred and the rest of the £2.6million payout was given to the Court of Protection for the child's benefit. Samatha's mother and Hills, now 49, were given a ‘generous’ £4,000 a month . for household expenses to compensate them for not being able to work . through providing full-time care. Katherine Robinson, prosecuting, said that the couple bought a property in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, in February 2000 for £22,500 under a council right to buy scheme using part of the £270,000 paid to Watson for her own use. They later claimed £213,000 to from the Court of Protection to buy three properties - including the one they had already purchased. Miss Robinson said: 'The money was never used to buy that house because they already owned it.' They subsequently sold the property for £74,000 and spent the cash.

JPMorgan Chase & Co has agreed to pay a $100 million (£62.4m) fine to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and admit its traders engaged in reckless behaviour during the London Whale trading debacle in 2012. The settlement follows one month after . it paid $920 million to four other U.S. and British regulators to . resolve probes of the bank's $6.2 billion in derivative losses involving . its chief investment office. The bank was instructed to send the funds to accounts receivable at the CFTC's division of enforcement. Fined: JPMorgan Chase & Co has agreed to pay a $100 million (£62.4m) fine to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and admit its traders engaged in reckless behaviour during the London Whale trading debacle in 2012 . The episode has proven to be one that just about every regulator the bank deals with has wanted to investigate and levy fines. The Justice Department, even after filing criminal charges against two former JPMorgan traders who allegedly helped conceal the losses, is still investigating whether to bring any action against the bank. 'We are pleased to be able to put behind us another aspect of the CIO (chief investment office) trading matter by the resolution of the CFTC investigation,' JPMorgan spokesman Joseph Evangelisti said. Crisis: JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon (pictured in 2009) was dubbed the King of Wall Street but has seen his reputation tarnished by the debacle . The settlement with the CFTC comes as JPMorgan continues to deal with regulators and U.S. authorities on a number of fronts. The bank is the middle of trying to negotiate a global settlement with federal prosecutors over its role in the packaging and selling of faulty mortgage-backed securities that could result in a potential $11 billion settlement. On Friday, JPMorgan announced it has set aside up to $23 billion in reserves to pay for all its potential legal bills to come. The CFTC, in its case, charged the bank with violating a prohibition on manipulative conduct when it traded in the credit default swaps that the bank had built an outsized exposure to by early 2012 and then needed to quickly exit to try to minimize the losses. By selling a huge volume of swaps in a concentrated period, the bank's traders 'recklessly disregarded' the principle that legitimate market forces should set prices, the CFTC said. 'JPMorgan traders acted recklessly with respect to this fundamental precept by employing an aggressive trading strategy,' the CFTC said in a portion of the settlement to which the bank admitted to. The reckless conduct occurred on one day, February 29, 2012, according to the agreement. One Republican commissioner, Scott O'Malia, voted against the settlement and said he thought the CFTC should have further investigated whether JPMorgan engaged in a more serious violation of price manipulation. 'I am concerned that in a rush to join in on a settlement brokered by other regulators, the Commission may be missing the opportunity to pursue allegations of greater wrongdoing,' O'Malia said in a statement. By charging the bank with 'employing a manipulative device,' the agency relied on new powers granted it by the 2010 Dodd Frank financial regulatory overhaul. The agency previously had to prove a defendant intended to engage in manipulate conduct, a bar so high that the commission was able to bring few cases under it. The new authority, introduced by Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell, allows the CFTC to rely on evidence of 'reckless' misconduct rather than any specific intent. The CFTC case against JPMorgan 'is exactly what were looking for' in providing the new authority, Cantwell said in an interview. 'We think it really does create a bright line in the marketplace,' she said. According to the CFTC charges, a JPMorgan portfolio in credit default indices with a net value of more than $51 billion started to plummet in January 2012. In February, as daily losses were large and growing, the traders tried to reduce their mark-to-market losses. The chief investment office had a $65 billion short position on one index, CDX NA.IG9 10 year index, and on February 29, sold $7 billion in protection on it. The sales substantially dropped the market price of the index and improved the book value of the group's position, the CFTC said. Two former bank employees have already been criminally charged with trying to hide some of the losses by deliberately giving inaccurate values to the securities involved in the trades. The CFTC has been operating on a skeleton staff since the October 1 government shutdown, and called some employees in on Wednesday on an 'emergency basis' to announce the settlement, Commissioner Bart Chilton said on CNBC.","To admit traders acted recklessly during London Whale trading debacle .

A burglar who vowed to go straight after forming a bond with one of his victims under a flagship government scheme has sentenced to five years in prison after a new crime spree. Margaret Foxley, 54, had agreed to meet career criminal Ian Ashworth in prison, despite the fact that he had stolen a laptop containing photographs of her daughter Jessica, who subsequently died in a car crash. Ashworth, 44, and Mrs Foxley had taken part in the Government’s flagship Restorative Justice scheme, and even appeared together on BBC’s The One Show to discuss the initiative,  in which victims come face to face with offenders in the hope of shocking them into staying out of trouble. Behind bars: Ian Ashworth publicly vowed to go straight after stealing a laptop containing photographs of singer Jessica Foxley, 21, who later died in a car crash . However, just eight months after chatting to hosts Alex Jones and Matt Baker about ending his life of crime, Ashworth crept into a private area of his local church and helped himself to the £100 from in the charity boxes. He was caught and bailed, only to then go on another burglary spree striking eight times, including twice in one day at homes and another church stealing cash and valuables. Police rearrested him again after he was placed on a wanted list. His arrest follows reports the restorative justice scheme has been a success across the UK. Despite his return to crime Mrs Foxley, a Conservative town councillor, has promised to meet Ashworth again in jail after he pleaded guilty to two burglaries and asked for eight other break ins to be considered. 'I would like to speak to him to understand what went wrong and also believe it would be beneficial for him to meet the more recent victims of his crimes,' she said in a statement.Ashworth from Great Harwood, Lancashire, who has clocked up more than 90 offences met Mrs Foxley in 2009 after he was locked away for year and nine months following a series of raids including a burglary at her home. Apology: Jessica's mother Margaret, pictured with her daughter, agreed to meet Jessica just days after her daughter's funeral in October 2009 . During the break in, Ashworth grabbed a camera and jewellery as well as a laptop containing photographs of her singer daughter Jessica, 21, who was subsequently killed in a car crash with two friends in Colne. He also stole Jessica’s silver necklace set which her parents had made for her 18th birthday. Mrs Foxley had initally refused to meet Ashworth because she was so appalled at his crimes yet was persuaded to see him after being moved by the forgiving nature of Jessica in the weeks before her death. The meeting took place in the chapel at his prison just ten days after Jessica’s funeral in October 2009. Ashworth and Mrs Foxley shook hands and he admitted he had sold the laptop for just £35 on the black market to buy drugs. During the meeting he wept and said: ‘I’m really sorry for what I’ve done.' Later . he explained: 'I wanted to change but I didn’t know how. When I met . Margaret at first I wanted to get it over with and get out of there. When she told me about her daughter, it really hit me. 'I . realised I’d been selfish and hadn’t given a damn about -anybody. What . right did I have to do what I’d done to her? It gave me strength to go . straight and I believe Margaret saved my life.' After . his release on parole from jail last year, Ashworth went on the One . Show in January and promised to go into schools to talk to students . about his experiences in the hope of warning them off crime. Theft: During the break-in at the Foxley family home, Ashworth stole a laptop containing photographs of Jessica and a necklace she received on her 18th birthday . Tragedy: Jessica Foxley died in a car crash in Colne, Lancashire, in 2009. Her mother met burglar Ian Ashworth after being moved by Jessica's forgiving nature . However, Burnley Crown Court was told on August 4 that the priest at Wulstan’s Roman Church in Great Harwood found charity boxes missing. Ashworth was identified by police from CCTV footage and was questioned and charged before being bailed. Despite being on bail, on August 29, Ashworth break into a house and stole an iPhone while the occupant was home. He was again recognised from CCTV and while police tried to trace him he carried out seven more raids. Stephen Parker, prosecuting, said that in one of the break ins on September 16, a mother and daughter returned to their home, to find Ashworth in their hall. The daughter chased him through the house and into the back yard. The victims discovered a glass panel had been smashed and rooms searched and a handbag containing £200 cash and four gold rings worth £800 were stolen. Keith Harrison, mitigating, said . Ashworth had 'resolved' not to commit any crime on his release, but . unfortunately his heroin addiction 'got the better of him'. Meeting place: Margaret Foxley went to meet Ashworth while he was serving his sentence at HM Prison Preston . He added: 'He committed the offences in a flurry of uncontrolled behaviour. The crimes were unsophisticated and opportunist, but grossly upsetting for those whose houses were burgled.''He’s let himself down and the court down. He did manage to stay clean for quite a while.' Passing sentence, judge Mr Recorder Philip Parry slammed the charity boxes theft. He told Ashworth: 'It’s bad enough that somebody would go into a church and steal charitable collections, but this was that in a private area of the church. 'You explained to police that you felt really bad about what you did that day, were remorseful and didn’t want it to happen again. 'The court is sympathetic to people who have done their best to rid themselves of the vice-like grip of heroin addiction, but you committed many more offences. 'Your expressions of remorse and sympathy can only take you so far today. The public in this area are entitled to be protected from people like you, addiction or no addiction.'","Ian Ashworth stole laptop containing pictures of Jessica Foxley .

A kind-hearted charity boss had his life 'torn apart' after he was conned and falsely accused of rape by a man who pretended to be a vulnerable 17-year-old. Will Clark, founder of the award-winning charity Rainbow Rooms UK, spent several weeks trying to help Shane Peake who claimed to have been thrown out by his family for being gay. The 26-year-old was put in temporary lodgings with carers after he went to Wiltshire Council. Mr Clark's Salisbury-based charity Rainbow Rooms UK also provided him with additional support. Shane Peake (left) has been jailed for four-and-a-half years after falsely accusing charity boss Will Clark (right) of rape and stealing from carers who put him up . But Peake, who said his name was Steven Shaw, stole from those who took him in and 'destroyed' the life of mentor Mr Clark by falsely accusing him of rape. Peake, who had claimed to be a poor teenager from South Yorkshire, has now been jailed for four and a half years. Mr Clark's organisation supported gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender young people. But the 43-year-old grew suspicious about Peake’s story and questioned him about his background and situation. Peake then went to the authorities and accused Mr Clark of rape, Salisbury Crown Court heard. Detectives investigating the allegation uncovered a number of aliases used by Peake and he was arrested. He had also stolen from his carers and Mr Clark, it was revealed. Peake has been jailed for four-and-a-half years after admitting theft, burglary, fraud and perverting the course of justice at Salisbury Crown Court . He admitted theft, burglary, fraud and perverting the course of justice. Mr Clark, from Salisbury, Wiltshire, said his life fell apart ‘beyond repair’ following the fake rape claims. He became depressed and ended up in hospital following an overdose. Mr Clark ran the award-winning charity Rainbow Rooms UK for six years . Mr Clark, who lives with his partner of 17 years, said: 'I was destroyed. I was devastated and I couldn’t believe what was being said about me. 'I went to pieces, mentally and physically.' Police told him within days that no evidence had been found to support the rape claim and no charges would be brought against him. But Mr Clark still faced an agonising three-month wait for Peake’s case to come to court and the facts to be made public. He was forced to close down the award-winning charity he had devoted years to building up and says the sentence doesn’t end his ordeal. Mr Clark, who ran the charity for six years, said: 'I couldn’t believe people when they said they didn’t believe the rape allegation. 'I didn’t want anyone near me. I couldn’t bear to be around people and I couldn’t bear anyone touching me. 'Everything felt dirty. It wasn’t rational - but I wasn’t rational. It is hard to believe that anyone can do something like this to another person. 'I used to give people the benefit of the doubt but I can’t do that any more. I get panic attacks when I’m in large groups of people and I can’t be alone in a one-to-one situation with someone without thinking about what they might say about me. 'I have no confidence in myself and I have no trust in other people. I’m simply not the same person that I was before.' He added: 'I went to court because I thought it might give me some form of closure. But it wasn’t like that. 'I used to give people the benefit of the . doubt but I can’t do that any more. I get panic attacks when I’m in . large groups of people and I can’t be alone in a one-to-one situation . with someone without thinking about what they might say about me' - Will Clark . 'I had to hear it all again and go through it all again.' Mr Clark, who is on medication for depression and is seeing a counsellor, says he cannot see the charity re-opening. He said: 'Everything was tarnished by what he said I did. He has destroyed not just my reputation but the reputation of the charity. 'Everything the charity was and all it did in the community has gone. It is such a huge loss.' Detective Constable Cat Isaac of Wiltshire Police said: 'This case has had a massive impact on Will Clark. His life has been torn apart by Peake’s actions. 'We hope all those people who were deceived by Peake and have suffered as a consequence will be reassured by the sentence.' Wiltshire Council said they take every precaution when dealing with vulnerable young people and those involved in their care are always trained and vetted. A spokesman said: 'Firstly, we need to highlight this is a very unusual set of circumstances. 'Wiltshire Council’s priority is to ensure the most vulnerable in our communities are protected.

A Pacific Islander trying to flee rising seas caused by global warming in his home country of Kiribati has asked a New Zealand court if he can pursue his claim to be the world's first climate change refugee. The low-lying South Pacific island nation has a population of more than 100,000, but its average height of six-and-a-half feet above sea level makes it one of the countries most vulnerable to rising waters and other climate change effects. Ioane Teitiota, 37, asked New Zealand's High Court in Auckland to let him appeal a decision that refused him asylum on the grounds he fell short of the legal criteria, such as fear of persecution or threats to his life. At threat: The low-lying South Pacific is one of the countries most vulnerable to rising waters . Teitiota, who came to New Zealand in 2007 and has three children born there, said he and his family would suffer serious harm if forced to return to Kiribati because there was no land he could safely return to. 'There's no future for us when we go back to Kiribati,' he told the appeal tribunal, adding that a return would pose a risk to his children's health. Michael Kidd, Teitiota's lawyer, told Radio New Zealand: 'The refugee convention which came into effect at the end of the Second World War needs to be changed, to incorporate people who are fleeing climate catastrophe, and what's happening to Kiribati in the next 30 years is a catastrophe. The High Court on Wednesday reserved its decision. Last month, leading climate scientists said they were more certain that human activity was the main cause of global warming, which would bring rising sea levels to swamp coasts and low-lying islands. Officials in Kiribati (pictured) has bought land in Fiji to grow food and build a potential resettlement site . Teitiota's claim for refugee status spelled out how high tides breached seawalls and rising ocean levels were contaminating drinking water, killing crops and flooding homes. New Zealand's Immigration and Protection Tribunal accepted the genuineness of Teitiota's claims but said he was in the same position as other residents of Kiribati, which was taking action to avert the impact of rising sea levels. Kiribati has bought land in Fiji to grow food and build a potential resettlement site for people displaced by rising seas. It is trying to give its people skills to become more attractive as immigrants, an approach it calls 'migration with dignity'. New Zealand and Australia, the two most developed countries in the South Pacific, have resisted calls to change immigration rules in favour of Pacific people displaced by climate change. Jane McAdam, an expert on refugee law at Sydney's University of New South Wales, said while conditions in Kiribati are difficult, there was little chance they fell within the scope of the refugee convention or the U.N.

Mohammed Yasin was drinking vodka before getting into his Nissan Micra, accompanied by his four-year-old child, at rush hour. Yasin, 29, was driving close to his home in Cheetham Hill when he swerved in the road, mounted a pavement and careered into the bus stop, a court heard. Police officers were called to the scene of the accident at around 5.30pm on October 1. They discovered Yasin at the wheel smelling of alcohol. Kerry Bell, prosecuting, told . Manchester City Magistrates’ Court: 'The defendant did a U-turn and mounted a . pavement and collided with a bus stop. 'He said he took a short cut, and a child had run out in front of him, which caused him to lose control of the vehicle. 'He accepted he consumed some vodka and was drunk in charge of a child.' The father had been to pick up his wife's medication from a nearby hospital and his son 'insisted on going with him', magistrates were told. When police breathalysed Yasin they found 111mg of alcohol on his breath - the legal limit is 35mg. He admitted two charges, one of drink-driving and another of being drunk in charge of a child. Defending his client David Philpott, said: 'He’s admitted that the accident was caused by someone running into the road.' But District Judge Paul Richardson said: 'It doesn’t matter. He was driving with 111mg of alcohol in his system and was in charge of a four-year-old.' The judge told Yasin: 'You should never have been driving. Thankfully, there wasn’t anyone at the bus stop.' Yasin was handed an interim driving ban. He is due to be sentenced next month after reports have been prepared by the probation service.","Mohammed Yasin admitted drinking vodka before getting behind wheel .

A benefits fraudster who enlisted a sidekick to pose in a wheelchair and pretend to be his sick and bedbound father in order to scam more than £20,000 from taxpayers has been spared jail. Emilio Brunetti, 54, of Fulham, south-west London, paid 62-year-old Martin Rafferty £80 per time to pretend to be elderly Antonio Brunetti in an attempt to evade detection by a council fraud team. The son was granted power of attorney for his ailing father in April 2008 and was on housing benefit, council tax benefit and a social tenancy in his father's name, Harrow Crown Court heard yesterday. Avoids jail: Benefits fraudster Emilio Brunetti (right in both), with his late father Antonio Brunetti (left). The son, 54, has been spared a jail sentence after he enlisted a sidekick to pretend to be his sick and bedbound father . Hammersmith and Fulham Council investigators said suspicions were raised when neighbours reported that they had not seen the father for a long time and understood that he was living in Italy. When fraud officers visited the home to check that the father was living there in 2012, they were greeted by Brunetti and a sleeping man in a wheelchair - now known to be Rafferty. Brunetti said that he could not wake his father as he had taken strong medication due to a recent operation to remove a brain tumour. But fraud officers did not believe this and rumbled the scam. The investigators viewed housing association London and Quadrant’s CCTV footage which clearly showed the man posing as Mr Brunetti Snr walking to his car unaided after the visit.

Brunetti . received a six-month sentence suspended for two years at the court in . north-west London. Rafferty, of Hammersmith, west London, received a . four-month sentence suspended for two years. Greg Smith, Hammersmith and Fulham Council's deputy leader, said: ‘It beggars belief that these two men have avoided jail and there can be no doubt that they have got off very lightly indeed. ‘Paying someone to pose as your dying father to cheat taxpayers is about as low as it gets. This duo did not sleepwalk into committing this crime but they have now been given a rude awakening. ‘If Antonio Brunetti knew the lengths his son went to in order to scrounge benefits he would probably be turning in his grave.’ Brunetti defrauded the council out of £5,988 of housing benefit and £990 of council tax benefit. He also illegally claimed £13,140 of income support. Mr Brunetti Snr has since died in Brazil.

A Southern California man went looking for sharks on his paddleboard on Wednesday, but he ended up being the one watched when a 9-foot great white shark came right up to his board. Mike Durand had already spotted one of the juvenile sharks as he plied the waters off Manhattan beach. When that one swam away, he thought the thrill had ended. Then another beast came right at him. Scroll down for video... Up close and personal: Mike Durand took his paddleboard out at Manhattan Beach to spot sharks but one specimen ended up taking even more of an interest in him . 'He's swimming around me,' Durand says in video he captured with his GoPro camera. 'Hopefully he's not coming to get me.' 'Holy s**t! He's checking me out,' says Durand as the torpedo-shaped shark swims directly under the paddleboard. The encounter lasts only a moment, but the shark's proximity understandably rattles the veteran surfer. 'I'm shaking like a leaf,' he says as he gasps for air. 'Gnarly!' 'I'm shaking like a leaf!': The 9-foot great white shark spent some time cruising around Durand, who is understandably rattled in the video he captured of the encounter . Circling: As the beast circled, Durand kept his camera steadily trained on the 9-foot juvenile great white . Durand's curious shark was a juvenile, about half the length of a full-grown adult. The largest specimens of great whites, which frequent waters off the coasts of every continent but Antarctica, can grow in excess of 20 feet and are able to detect a single drop of blood in 25 gallons of water. Durand and his employees at SwellMagnet.com, a site that posts free surf reports and streams surf cameras, posted his heart pumping footage on Youtube and the story quickly spread to local news. But the original post on Durand's Youtube account likely sums the experience up best: . 'It's all fun until someone loses an eye, (or leg).' Memorable: After some very tense moments, the shark swam away and Durand was left with a very thrilling story to take back to his friends and family--and thanks to his video, to the entire world .

A bride who was jilted just weeks before she was due to get married has donated her lavish reception to a disability charity. Michelle Marxen had planned her dream wedding down to the finest details when her financé suddenly told her he didn't love her anymore. Instead of letting the ballroom venue, food and entertainment go to waste however, the North Dakota bride-to-be handed it over to a charity so its disabled clients could have a Halloween party instead. Jilted: Michelle Marxen's boyfriend called off their wedding weeks before the couple were due to get married . When Miss Marxen's boyfriend walked out on her their whole wedding, due to take place on October 19, had been booked and paid for. 'My fairy tale wedding. You know, as a young girl, you dream of your wedding day,' she said. The limousine, flowers, band and reception at Ramada's Crystal Ballroom could have gone to waste when the wedding, which had cost Miss Marxen thousands of dollars, was cancelled. 'We spent a whole year planning this wedding and it all ended in a phone call,' Miss Marxen told Fox 10. However, a charity dedicated to enhancing the lives of those with disabilities will now host a Halloween party for the people it cares for. 'What was supposed to be my special day will now be their special day,' Miss Marxen said, after donating the reception to Creative Care for Reaching Independence. Miss Marxen was jilted the day the couple's wedding invitations were set to go out. Lavish: The couple were due to celebrate their wedding at Ramada's Crystal Ballroom . Heartbroken: Michelle's financé broke off their wedding in a phone call . Her fiancé told her 'I love you,' as he left for work but later that day, as Miss Marxen was returning from a funeral, he called with life-changing news. 'He didn’t want to marry me. He said he didn’t love me anymore,' the young woman said. Her dream wedding may have turned into a nightmare, but Miss Marxen was determined the reception would not go to waste. 'You can’t heal if you’re just going to dwell on what could have been,' she said. Now, on the day she was supposed to be celebrating her marriage with family and friends, disabled adults will gather at the Crystal Ballroom for a party. Jody Hudson, of CCRI, said she was speechless when she heard about the offer. 'I could not believe it. I called the next day to make sure it was for real,' Ms Hudson said.

Robert Perez, of Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, was said to have made groaning noises as he whispered obscenities to his horrified victims. The 31-year-old had a stash of SIMs used to make the calls and one was found in his work locker, said Tom Gill, prosecuting. ‘Perez admitted harassing the females - he said he knew he could not have them but they were his sexual fantasies,’ he told West London Magistrates’ Court in Hammersmith. ‘He said he did it for his own sexual benefit and admitted (performing a sex act) and touching himself while on the phone to the victims. ‘He said he had thrown away all the other SIM cards. One was found in his locker at work.’ Perez was either at home or visiting family in Harrow, north-west London, when he made dozens of calls from May 2012 until last month. ‘Five females had been receiving sexually explicit texts and calls from May 2012 and they had continued to that date,’ Mr Gill added. ‘The victims believed he was (performing a sex act) and the content was sexually explicit.

A nursery nurse has been spared jail after watering a 'professional' cannabis farm uncovered at her rural home when her ex reported a burglary. Josephine Merrick, 59, was arrested at the £420,000 Herefordshire home she shared with Malcolm White in October 2011. White, 63, dialed 999 to report a robbery but when officers arrived at their isolated home in Whitbourne, they discovered the cannabis factory in the couple's garage. Police officers were called to the home Josephine Merrick shared with Malcolm White after Mr White dialed 999 to report a burglary at the property. Officers found a 'professional' cannabis factory in the couple's garage . Officers seized around 60 plants, believed to be worth up to £18,000 and capable of producing £60,000-worth of cannabis a year. Merrick pleaded guilty to producing a controlled substance but said her involvement in cultivating the Class B drug was limited. Hereford Crown Court heard the nursery nurse only 'watered the plants when asked and trimmed the buds but had nothing to do with their growth.' On Tuesday the mother-of-three was spared prison after Judge Robert Juckes QC said a custodial sentence would be a 'wholly inappropriate' punishment. Instead she was ordered to carry out just 15 hours of unpaid work. Merrick was also sentenced to a 12-month supervision order after she entered a guilty plea at an earlier hearing. Police found around 60 cannabis plants at the couple's home in Whitbourne in Herefordshire . Prosecutor Simon Phillips told the court police discovered the cannabis farm after White called 999 to report a break-in. Two Birmingham men, Robert Richards, 30, and Darren Randall, 26, were arrested in nearby Leigh Sinton in Herefordshire, hours later. The pair were jailed in February this year after they were convicted of aggravated burglary. Nicholas Roberts, defending, said Merrick’s arrest and the ordeal of giving evidence during the burglars’ trial had been a ‘sentence in itself’ for her. He said: 'She is only here today because she was honest. 'She . was initially treated as being a witness in the burglary case but she . told police that she did know about the cannabis and was arrested. 'She . gave a frank interview and helped all she could and gave evidence in . the trial of Randall and Richards. Her life has been on hold. 'Police . installed alarms in her home and told her she wouldn’t even be safe to . walk to her local Tesco. She has moved addresses.' Merrick, who shared the £420,000 rural home, pictured, with White admitted producing a controlled substance but said her involvement in cultivating the Class B drug was 'limited' Speaking at the time, Mr Froggatt said: 'The news of her arrest was a complete shock to the system. 'She has very little do with us now but we never thought she would get into something like this. 'I find it hard to believe. Josie has always been very anti-drugs.' White, who also admitted growing cannabis at an earlier hearing, is accused of shooting Richards, who had his leg amputated following the botched raid. He denies wounding with intent and will face trial next month at Worcester Crown Court.

Xu Anyou was born with a condition which made his feet grow but now he finally has pair of shoes that fit (right) Parasitic worms, spread by mosquitoes, can grow up to four inches long and block the lymphatic system, causing arms, legs, breasts or genitals to swell to huge sizes. As Xu grew older his feet became so large he was unable to find a suitable pair of shoes. In the summer he would go barefoot while in the winter he would have to wear a specially made pair constructed by his brother. But after hearing about Xu's plight, the manager of a local company has presented him with three pairs of tailor-made shoes which are 28.5cm long and 22.5cm wide. Xu Anyou, 27, from Fuzhou, in eastern China's Jiangxi Province, has a form of Elephantiasis . The kind manager has also said he would provide Xu with free shoes when these pairs needed replacing. Last year a boy underwent surgery at a hospital in China because his feet grew so big he was unable to walk. Teenager Xiao Meng was born with a genetic condition that causes the feet to swell abnormally. The manager of a local company has presented Xu with three pairs of tailor-made shoes . Xiao's family were too poor to pay for treatment and, as a result, his feet grew bigger and bigger with age. His family received thousands of pounds towards his care as a result of a campaign. In 2007, 546 million people around the world were treated to prevent elephantiasis. Xiao's father massages his feet in Shanghai Children's Hospital before the operation . A total of 81 countries are endemic for the disease. Infection is usually happens in childhood but the painful and profoundly disfiguring visible manifestations of the disease occur later in life. Lymphatic filariasis leads to permanent disability. Approximately 65 per cent of those infected live in the South-East Asia Region, 30 per cent in the African Region and the remainder in other tropical areas. The medical term for elephantiasis is Lymphatic filariasis. Infection occurs when filarial parasites are transmitted to humans through mosquitoes. When a mosquito with infective stage larvae bites a person, the parasites are deposited on the person's skin from where they enter the body. The larvae then migrate to the lymphatic vessels where they develop into adult worms in the human lymphatic system. Patients with chronic disabilities like elephantiasis, lymphoedema, or hydrocele are advised to maintain rigorous hygiene and take necessary precautions to prevent secondary infection and aggravation of the disease condition.","Xu Anyou, 27, from Jiangxi Province, has a form of Elephantiasis .

A living blob of jelly that dwells in the darkest depths of the ocean has been officially named the world's ugliest animal. The blobfish, described as 'hideous' by Simon Watt from the Ugly Animal Preservation Society, is a jelly-like fish that resembles a bald, grumpy old man. Measuring up to a foot in length, it lives between 600 and 1,200 metres below the ocean surface off the coasts of Australia and Tasmania. Scroll down for video . The blobfish, described as 'hideous' by Simon Watt from the Ugly Animal Preservation Society, measures up to a foot in length. It lives between 600 and 1,200 metres below the ocean surface off the coasts of Australia and Tasmania . Despite being completely inedible, it has a habit of being hauled up in trawler nets. Experts believe the blobfish is under serious threat, although there are no reliable estimates of its numbers. 'We've needed an ugly face for endangered animals for a long time,' said Mr Watt, speaking at the British Festival of Science at the University of Newcastle. The Axolotl, a freaky cross between Peter Pan and the Xmen, is endangered because of urbanisation in Mexico City and polluted waters . 'For too long the cute and fluffy animals have taken the limelight but now the blobfish will be a voice for the mingers who always get forgotten.' The blobfish topped a shortlist of five ugly animals voted for online by members of the public. In second place was the Kakapo, a critically endangered giant parrot from New Zealand, and number three was the Axolotl, a weird type of salamander from Mexico that is the equivalent of a giant tadpole. Next on the list was the Titicaca water frog, aka the 'scrotum frog', which is only found in Lake Titicaca on the border of Peru and Bolivia.

Locals make a frappe of the unfortunate frog, which is considered an aphrodisiac, by cooking it and running it through a blender. The last ugly animal is the proboscis monkey, from Borneo, whose enormous nose is literally its hooter. The nose provides a resonating echo chamber for the monkey's deafening mating calls. The Ugly Animal Preservation Society was set up to champion the cause of endangered creatures with no friends. It is backed by a number of celebrity scientists, presenters and comedians, and organises road shows and school visits. Particle physicist and broadcaster Professor Brian Cox said: 'I support the ugly animal campaign. There are too many people trying to save cute animals. They get all the press, and all the attention. 'Ugly animals are more deserving than cute animals.' Describing the blobfish, Mr Watt said: 'Indeed this is an ugly hideous thing.

An inspirational business student has refused to let being diagnosed with ovarian cancer put a stop to her ambition of taking part in the Miss Arizona pageant. Kristina Anderson, 25, was told in July that she had an aggressive form of cancer and needed to start chemotherapy immediately. While many young women in her situation would focus on getting better, Miss Anderson decided to enter the state pageant as a way to take her mind off her health problems. Inspiration: Kristina Anderson, pictured this week, is getting ready to take part in the Miss Arizona pageant while she has chemotherapy . Fighting spirit: The Miss Arizona contest will be the biggest pageant Kristina, pictured above in 2006, has ever been part of . 'I thought it would be a good distraction to focus on something else,' Miss Anderson said. In between chemotherapy treatments the former University of Chicago cheerleader has spent hours searching for dresses and preparing for the pageant, due to be held in Mesa in November. 'When I'm having chemo for eight hours a day, I'm able to get on the internet and shop for dresses,' she said. Miss Anderson, who is studying for her MBA at Grand Canyon University, has also had to raise funds for the first six months of her cancer treatment because of exclusions in her medical insurance. ' It was a shock,' Miss Anderson told the East Valley Tribune. 'Sadness, anger, all different types of emotions.' To help cover her medical costs, the student has set up a Go Fund Me website that has raise more than $11,000 so far. Positive: Former cheerleader Kristina, pictured a few years ago left, will wear headscarves at the pageant after losing her hair, right . Ambitious: The Chicago University student, pictured at her graduation, above, moved to Arizona recently to study for a MBA . With her family still in Illinois, Miss Anderson has been helped in her pageant preparations by one of the nurses from her doctor's office. 'I’m just kind of along for the ride. I went with her to pick out some dresses,' Sandy LeDuke said. Finding the perfect outfits to dazzle the judges has also been an obstacle for Miss Anderson, who had to find gowns that would cover the port in her body where her life-saving drugs are administered. She is also dealing with hair loss, telling ABC News: 'I'm trying to find unique ways to have pretty headwraps.' Miss Anderson, who is due to start her fourth - and hopefully final - round of chemotherapy soon, said losing her eyelashes due to treatment made her sad, but the support from friends and family helped her stay positive. Her determination has been supported by the current Miss Teen Arizona Olivia Argue, who tweeted: 'If this isn't inspiring I don't know what it.' Pageant director Britt Boyse added: 'She has such a rare positive outlook on everything. She's fighting for her life, but no matter how poorly she feels, she's just happy, outwardly, and appreciative.' The state pageant will be a big step for Miss Anderson, who has previously only competed at lower levels. Support: Kristina's family and friends, pictured with the student in August, have been helping her through treatment and her pageant preparations . Struggle: Kristina, pictured with her brother Sam, had to raise money for the first six months of her treatment . Winning attitude: Kristina, pictured at a 2006 pageant, has been praised for her positive outlook . She said that despite her challenges she tried to remain upbeat and hoped her experiences would inspire others to overcome difficulties in their life too. 'I try to stay positive and just be at peace with myself because it is challenging to know what's in front of me,' Miss Anderson said. 'Just be positive and be grateful for what you have,' she added.","Kristina Anderson is having chemotherapy for ovarian cancer in run up to competition .

Cringe-inducing subtitling errors could soon be a thing of the past, as broadcasting watchdog Ofcom have launched a quality crackdown. The BBC reported that the move follows complaints by viewers about the accuracy and reliability of the service, which is often used by viewers who are deaf or hard of hearing. Ofcom is now demanding that broadcasters monitor the quality of subtitles, which are used by more than a million people, every six months for two years. Scroll down for video . A weather presenter is the subject of a subtitling blunder - Ofcom has announced a crackdown on errors like this . According to the BBC, some complainants have said that although the pre-prepared subtitling is generally of good quality, live subtitling is often poor with errors sneaking in. Ofcom's Claudio Pollack told the BBC: 'Ofcom expects regular reporting by broadcasters to help improve subtitles over time, as well as allowing us to identify exactly which areas need most progress.' An embarrassing mistake spotted by an eagle-eyed BBC Breakfast viewer . Seventy channels in the UK now provide a subtitling service, and a consultation which started in May suggested that problems began when pre-recorded programmes were delivered to broadcasters too late to allow subtitles to be prepared in advance. Ofcom will publish a report based on its findings in spring 2014, and use the evidence to decide is changes to the current guidelines are needed. The BBC reported that the watchdog has also asked broadcasters to consider adding a time delay to live programming that is not time-sensitive, so that the quality of subtitling can be improved. Wrong: This Morning's staff had to apologise after viewers using the subtitles service saw this typo . A BBC announcer reporting 'a moment of silence for the Queen Mother' had his words transcribed as 'a moment of violence.' In another TV gaffe the sale of 'millions of puppies' confused subtitle users in a news piece about the Poppy Appeal for Remembrance Day. A roving reporter on BBC Breakfast became . an internet sensation, when he was subtitled wrongly as saying that the . pigs he was with 'love to nibble anything that comes into the shed, . like our willies.' These ladies were mis-subtitled when discussing Eurovision star Engelbert Humperdinck . The leader of the Labour Party has also not escaped the subtitling error - being referred to as 'Ed Miller Band' on one occasion. Former chief medical officer Sir Liam Donaldson became 'Silly and Admundsen' while the National Union of Students was renamed the National Union of Stew Departments. The Morning also suffered a toe-curling gaffe with its sub-title service after it accidentally confused the word 'rate' for 'rape' during a fashion segment. Live football commentary is also subtitled which has resulted in Poland being called Holland and former Liverpool keeper Jerzey Dudek becoming 'Dudeback.' But these kinds of errors are not just confined to the UK. Browne University in the US apologised after accidentally mis-subtitling the Dalai Lama. Their subtitle team quoted the holy man as saying 'f**k it' at the end of a speech on world peace.","Could this spell the end for embarrassing errors such as 'Ed Miller Band'?

Experts do not think Herod's tomb is the modest mausoleum that was discovered in 2007 (pictured) His burial place was a mystery for thousands of years, but in 2007 archaeologists believed they had uncovered the tomb of Herod the Great. However, now experts do not think the Biblical ruler's tomb is the surprisingly modest mausoleum in discovered in recent years, so the search is on once again to find the king of Judea's real resting place. The tomb thought to be Herod's, who ruled just before the time of Jesus' birth, was found in Herodium, which is a huge complex built under the rule of the king on a circular hill in the desert near Jerusalem. While there was much excitement at the time that the tomb had finally been found, archaeologists now believe that it is too small for a ruler known for his decadence and love of ambitious, large scale architectural projects. King Herod, who lived from 74 BC to 4 BC built a number of lavish building projects including the fortress of Masada, but he did so by burdening his people with heavy taxes. It was Jewish historian Flavius Josephus who suggested that the ruler was buried in his own creation of Herodium. Joseph Patrich, an archaeologist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told The Huffington Post that Josephus described the body laid out on a gold bed with luxurious fabrics and carried to its final resting place accompanied by a procession made up of subjects and the entire army. Archaeologist Ehud Netzer proclaimed that he had found Herod's tomb in 2007 - a building measuring 10 x 10 metres with a pointed roof - that contained three coffins. Archaeologists think the modest tomb does not belong to the famous ruler as it is too small and modest for a king who planned and built grand architectural complexes, such as his huge temple (a model is pictured) The base of what Israeli archaeologists thought was King Herod's tomb, near the West Bank town of Hebron . It was thought that a coffin of carved . red stone was that of the famous ruler, but Dr Patrich and his colleague . Benjamin Arubas, who also works at the university, are convinced that . the coffin does not belong to Herod. They came to this conclusion because the building is smaller than other royal tombs of the time and only has one pyramid. The tombs of the Hasmoneans - the royal dynasty proceeding Herod - had seven pyramids. Dr Patrich said: 'There is hardly space for 20 people to stand conveniently and there is no respectable gateway to lead in.' The archaeologists said the building has an awkward layout with two staircases above the tomb and is not symmetrically aligned with the rest of the complex, which would have been a design faux pas not fit for a king. The duo also believe that the ruler, known for his expensive taste, would not have settled for a coffin made of local stones, leading experts to question where the real location of Herod's tomb is and to whom the trio of coffins in Herodium belongs. Dr Patrich said that the people buried in the tomb could have been 'very dear' to Herod and might even have been close family members. He said that while Herod's tomb has not been found, there is much more of Herodium that has not yet been excavated.","Experts do not think the Biblical ruler's tomb is the surprisingly modest mausoleum that was discovered in 2007 .
