Physicians caring for the king of Spain say he is likely to be recuperating for the next six weeks after fracturing his hip during a much-criticized elephant-hunting trip to Africa. King Juan Carlos has come under a barrage of criticism for taking the trip while his country faces financial crisis. The 74-year-old monarch - recovering in a Madrid hospital from a hip replacement operation - has delegated his duties as head of state to his son, Prince Felipe, while he recuperates. The accident occurred early on Friday while the king was on safari in the Okavango area of Botswana. He was immediately flown home by private jet. Angel Villamor, a spokesman for the medical team caring for him, said he is recovering well.A royal palace statement said the king is due to begin physiotherapy Sunday. King Carlos underwent hip replacement surgery after fracturing his right hip in three places. The king had arrived in Africa on Monday and fell in his bedroom at a hunting lodge on yesterday. He was taken to Madrid last night on a 10-hour flight by private jet. The four-hour operation was carried out by Dr Angel Villamor at the San Jose Hospital in the Spanish capital. The king is expected to spend around ten days in hospital and another six weeks recuperating. A spokesman for the Royal Palace said today: 'Don Juan Carlos suffered a fracture in three fragments of his the right hip, linked to arthritis. 'His majesty's hip was operated on in the early hours of this morning by Dr Angel Villamor. 'A reconstruction of the fragments of the femoral fracture was carried out, and a prosthetic hip was inserted during the same surgery. 'His Majesty the King was admitted into hospital last night on return from a private trip to Botswana, where he injured his hip in an accidental fall.' Unlucky: The Spanish King was on trip hunting elephants in Botswana when he fell after returning to his bedroom in a lodge . The jaunt was the king's fourth operation in the past two years. Photographs of Juan Carlos posing next to a dead elephant and holding a shotgun were posted on Spanish news websites yesterday. The country is going through its worst . financial crisis for decades. But the King's trip is understood to have . cost around 33,000 euros (£27,000) a person. Many Spaniards took to Twitter to criticise the monarch for shooting elephants. 'What a disgrace to see a photo of 'our king' killing elephants in Africa,' wrote Manuel Caballero. Another wrote: 'Killing elephants is the cruelest and most expensive form of hunting.' Some Spaniards were outraged that the king was on an expensive hunting trip in Africa while his country is in the grip of a recession, with a record 4.75 million unemployed. Last week the king's 13-year-old grandson Felipe Juan Froilan was taken to hospital after accidentally shooting himself in the foot with a small 36 caliber shotgun while carrying out target practice at his home near Madrid. He is still recovering in the Quiron clinic in the Spanish capital. In 1956 Juan Carlos, then 18, accidentally shot and killed his 14-year-old brother Alfonos while handling a gun in Estoril, Portugal. The king has had eight operations since the 1980s, three of them following accidents while practising sports. He is a fan of hunting, sailing and skiing, but had to give up the the slopes recently for health reasons. Queen Sofia, who disapproves of hunting, is on a trip to Greece.","Monarch flown to to Madrid for four-hour operation .

French President Nicolas Sarkozy was told he had 'failed' the French people in a bitter televised debate with his socialist rival Francois Hollande. Fighting for his political life, Mr Sarkozy, who trails in the polls, was reminded that he had failed to control unemployment and 'abandoned industry'. Mr Hollande said: 'Unemployment rose by 1 million under Sarkozy – four million in total. A record high – 10 per cent of the population. Becoming angry, the incumbent retorted by saying: 'It's a lie, it's a lie [...] you're a little slanderer.' But despite a series of fireworks, neither candidate managed to land a knock-out blow in what observers described as a 'dramatic' debate but which, in reality, will not affect Sunday's vote. Scroll down for video... Question time: Francois Hollande (left) and Nicolas Sarkozy (right) with journalists Laurence Ferrari and David Pujadas during the televised debate . Rivals: Francois Hollande (left) and Nicolas Sarkozy (right) tried to wow voters by setting out their policies . Contented: Supporters of Socialist Party candidate Francois Hollande react as they watch his televised debate in Marseille . Staring straight at Sarkozy, Hollande said: 'In 2007 when you came to power you said if I don't reduce unemployment to five per cent I will have failed. You indeed failed because it doubled to 10 per cent.' A robust president hit back claiming there had been little social unrest while he led France for everyone. Sarkozy, who arrived at the studio with wife Carla Bruni, said he objected to left-wingers likening him to a fascist like Spain's former dictator General Franco or Marshall Petain, who led France's collaborationist Vichy regime during World War II. 'Why not Hitler?' said Sarkozy, as Hollande said he had been likened to 'all manner of zoo animals', without specifying which. Turn out: Nicolas Sarkozy's wife Carla Bruni (left) and former presidential socialist candidate Segolene Royal (right) were present behind the scenes at the debate . Support: The debate ¿ broadcast on France's two main terrestrial channels and on satellite news ¿ was expected to be watched by more than half of the country's 44.5 million voters . Mr Hollande said on France-3 . television afterwards that he showed voters 'what I was capable of' but . admitted: ''I don't think this is a debate ... that could bring out new . voters.' The campaign has largely focused on domestic issues such as the weak economy, immigration, and integration of French Muslims. Yet the outcome is considered crucial . to the rest of Europe as well because France is a major economic engine . at a time when the eurozone is trying to climb out of a debt crisis. Vociferous: A supporter of Socialist candidate Francois Hollande reacts during the televised debate . Mr Sarkozy said France needs to do . more to cut spending and high state debt, while Mr Hollande backs . government-funded stimulus programs. Both have pushed for similar approaches for the rest of the continent, too. The two debaters quibbled over . statistics; they scoffed sarcastically or spoke over each other, pointed . fingers and raised their voices. Their debates came across at times as . wonkish, esoteric or nitpicking. 'It's a lie! It's a lie!' Mr Sarkozy . insisted in one heated exchange on economic policies. The Socialist . contender, meanwhile, forcefully denied some of Mr Sarkozy's claims . about his intentions, insisting: 'I never said that'. Mr Hollande accused Mr Sarkozy of . appointing cronies to government posts, and the president shot back, . calling his rival 'a little slanderer' and noting he had named some . ministers from the political left in his first Cabinet. A high point came as Mr Hollande teed off on a presenter's question about what kind of president he would be. He tipped back in his chair, folded . his arms, and launched into a litany of points starting with the phrase: . 'As president of the Republic, I ...' on issues like the independence . of judges, his plan to defer much policy-making to the prime minister or . energy policy. 'You've just gave us a nice speech - . we got teary-eyed,' retorted Mr Sarkozy, trying to break down some of Mr . Hollande's points. 'Your bit about independence of judges is a joke.' Mr Hollande repeatedly using one of . his campaign catchwords: like 'unity' and 'change' to stress the . contrast between him and the divisive Mr Sarkozy. France's Socialist Party candidate for the 2012 French presidential election, Francois Hollande (centre) and his companion Valerie Trierweiler arrive at the TV studios . Pollsters say the incumbent turned . off a lot of voters early in his five-year term with his brash personal . style. A stagnant economy made those troubles worse. Mr Sarkozy said he is being unfairly . blamed for France's economic problems after years of crisis, and . insisted he's not 'the only guilty one'. 'Mr Sarkozy, you would have a hard . time passing for a victim,' replied Mr Hollande. 'It's never your fault. You always have a scapegoat. 'It's not me, it's the crisis that hit . me'.' Mr Sarkozy said Mr Hollande's economic plans would send France's debt through the roof and hurt the rest of Europe. The Socialist repeated his line that an euro-zone austerity package needs growth-minded policies, too. Mr Sarkozy stressed, again and again, . Mr Hollande's inexperience, and suggested the Socialist would not be . able to handle Europe's debt crisis. 'We avoided the disappearance of . Greece, that wasn't so easy. ... I'm not sure, Mr Hollande, that you . would have done much better.' Showman: Nicolas Sarkozy spoke to thousands of his supporters at Trocadero square on May 1 . Mr Hollande fired back: 'Europe isn't . out of the woods. It is today confronted with a possible resurgence of . the crisis with a generalised austerity, and I don't want that.' Mr Hollande further criticised tax . reforms under Mr Sarkozy seen by leftists as too friendly to the rich. Mr Sarkozy countered: 'Saying that we offered gifts to the rich ... is . slander. It's a lie.' At this, Mr Hollande laughed. Both the Socialists and conservatives . have sought ways to lure voters who backed Marine Le Pen, leader of the . anti-immigrant National Front party who won a stunning 18 per cent of . the first-round vote. Mr Sarkozy denounced those who compared him to France's Nazi collaborators because of his tough campaign rhetoric on immigrants. 'Borders are not a bad word,' Mr Sarkozy said about his calls to limit the number of immigrants France takes in. Mr Hollande, meanwhile, took a similar . position to Mr Sarkozy when it came to special treatment for France's . large Muslim community. He said he would not allow separate . menus in public cafeterias or separate hours in swimming pools for men . and women to satisfy Muslims' demands, and also said he would firmly . support France's ban on the face-covering Islamic veils. Mass rally: Tens of thousands waved French national flags as Nicolas Sarkozy took to the stage on May 1 . Mr Sarkozy took a predator pose from . the outset, leaning forward on the desk through much of the debate. Mr . Hollande frequently leaned back in his chair, raising his voice less . often, and at one point even appeared to yawn. Mr Sarkozy's assertive posture, in . another setting, could be seen as a good thing for a debate. But one of . the things his critics dislike most about him is a personality seen as . too aggressive, so it may not work in his favour. The debate – broadcast on France's two main terrestrial channels and on satellite news – was expected to be watched by more than half of the country's 44.5 million voters. No fewer than 22 cameras were trained on the two politicians as they sat eight feet apart across a single table. Both agreed on a strictly maintained studio temperature of between 19 and 20 degrees Celsius (66 to 68 Fahrenheit). Sarkozy, who cancelled all engagements on Wednesday so as to be ready for the debate, insisted on chairs that could be adjusted for height. Voilà! French President Nicolas Sarkozy cast's his vote in Paris in the first round of the elections while wife Carla Bruni looks on last week . The 5ft 5ins president is extremely sensitive about his height, and has been known to stand on boxes, and even on tiptoe, in a bid to look taller. There was also a digital clock to show how long each candidate spoke for. Polls have regularly portrayed him as the most unpopular president in the history of modern France, with critics attacking his brash, moneyed style. Sarkozy awarded himself a pay rise of 140 per cent within a few days of attaining office in 2007 and then married Bruni, the ex-supermodel and multimillionaire heiress. If he loses in the second round, Sarkozy will become the first president since Valery Giscard d'Estaing to fail in a re-election bid. Polls put Hollande seven points ahead of Sarkozy. In recent days, Sarkozy has been desperately trying to appeal to the far-right National Front vote, saying he will cut down on immigration and strengthen border controls. He has also warned that Hollande's tax-and-spend plans would cause economic catastrophe. The latest poll by BVA has Hollande winning the election by 7 percentage points, with the Socialist ahead on 53.5 per cent to Sarkozy's 46.5 per cent.","Socialist Francois Hollande tells Sarkozy he has 'failed' French people .

"By . John Hutchinson . PUBLISHED: . 16:56 EST, 25 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:57 EST, 25 May 2012 . Loyal: Osama bin Laden was still honoured by his surviving wives despite his atrocities . Osama bin Laden's three wives remained fiercely loyal and refused to give information following the death of the terror-leader, it has been revealed. The three women were arrested by Pakistani security forces after the Navy SEAL raid on bin Laden's safe house in the town of Abbottabad, about 35 km (60 miles) from the capital Islamabad. Slowly puffing on a cigarette in a rundown Islamabad villa a Pakistani intelligence agent described months of questioning the women and said he struggled to glean any worthwhile information. Yemeni-born Amal Al-Sadeh, the youngest of the three, was headstrong and showed fury when asked questions, while the others, Saudi citizens, expressed displeasure by mostly keeping silent behind their veils, the agent said. All appeared to strongly support bin Laden, despite the militant's long and bloody record of orchestrating violence across the world. 'They were all nostalgic whenever they talked about him,' said the intelligence agent, a slim man in a dark suit. 'I could sense Amal was always angry whenever I spoke with her,' he added. 'She objected to being questioned and rarely gave away anything.' But at times Amal was somewhat flexible. 'Amal once told me that she and bin Laden liked Che Guevara. She seemed like a rebel so I questioned her about Latin American leftists. I found her very interesting,' said the agent. It was not possible to independently confirm his account. Ernesto 'Che' Guevara was an Argentine Marxist who was a major figure in the Cuban revolution. He was executed in Bolivia in 1967. Keeping an eye on things: The now famous picture of bin Laden watching the TV in his hideout - he was soon found and killed . Scene: The hideout house of Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden where he was killed by US Special Forces in a ground operation in Pakistan's hill city of Abbottabad . Amal, who was wounded in the raid that killed bin Laden, traveled to Afghanistan to marry bin Laden when she was 18 years old and he was in his early 40s, her father told Reuters in an interview in Yemen in 2011. 'The other wives didn't say much. They were boring,' said the agent. Pakistan deported bin Laden's three widows and 11 children to Saudi Arabia last month. A Pakistani court had sentenced them to prison for entering Pakistan illegally and ordered their deportation after the end of their prison term. Loyal: Amal Al-Sadeh, one of Osama Bin Laden's wives, has stuck by her husband in spite of his atrocities . The agent did not say whether other Pakistani or U.S. officials questioned the women. He also did not give details on whether his questioning included anything about the night of the raid. Based on his conversations, the agent said he concluded the al Qaeda leader lived in the country for about six or seven years, in two towns. Pakistani officials describe bin Laden's long presence in the garrison town of Abbottabad as a security lapse and reject suggestions that members of the military or intelligence services were complicit in hiding him there. Pakistan dismisses Western criticism of its performance against militancy, saying it has sacrificed more lives than any other country which joined the U.S. war on militancy after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. Pakistan also stresses that it captured several high-profile al Qaeda figures on its soil such as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-confessed architect of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. The intelligence agent, who said he questioned the widows once a week, sometimes twice, recalls seeking information on whereabouts of other senior al Qaeda leaders, and coming up empty handed. 'I wanted to know if any others are in Pakistan,' he said. 'I wanted to know about Zawahri,' he said, adding that he didn't believe the former Egyptian doctor and current al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri was in the country. Turning to information he said he had come across on al Qaeda over the years, the agent said he was convinced that Zawahri was running al Qaeda's show in the region. 'Bin Laden was an inspirational figure for militants. It was Zawahri who was the main man. He was much more violent than bin Laden,' he said. 'These are my conclusions'. The intelligence agent said Pakistani authorities had retrieved some computers and cellphones from bin Laden's Abbottabad home, but trying to make sense of coded Arabic language proved frustrating -- with only a few clues on al Qaeda activities in Pakistan's northwestern tribal areas. The agent was non-committal about Pakistani doctor Shakil Afridi, who was sentenced to 33 years imprisonment by a court this week for running a fake vaccination campaign that helped the CIA pinpoint bin Laden's location in Abbottabad. 'Discovering that Afridi was helping the CIA and arresting him was not a problem,' he said without elaborating. But the agent, who was once stationed in Abbottabad while bin Laden was said to live there, only shrugged when asked how it was possible that the al Qaeda chief evaded capture in Pakistan for so long despite a global manhunt.

Approval: People with Alzheimer's have been left waiting for years to receive new drugs on the NHS it is claimed because the rationing body is bogged down in other tasks . Patients are waiting up to nine years for cancer and Alzheimer’s drugs to be available on the health service because approval takes so long. The delays mean that even new drugs given the all-clear in extensive trials remain stuck in the queue for years. A major study found that on average it takes five years from a treatment’s launch by a manufacturer to approval by the rationing body, NICE. But the process often lasts far longer, and on occasions NICE will not even start its assessment until a drug has been on the market for more than a year. One of the problems is that NICE – the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence – has a wide-ranging remit which includes drawing up NHS guidance on tackling obesity, alcohol abuse and other public health issues. But last night doctors and charities said it was unfair that patients were being denied potentially life-saving drugs just because the rationing body is bogged down in other tasks. They said the delays are affecting patients’ quality of life and could make the difference between someone being able to live independently or needing full-time care. Although patients can get drugs that have not yet been approved by NICE by paying privately or applying to the Cancer Drugs Fund, doctors are often reluctant to prescribe them. The report by the Office for Health Economics, obtained by GP Newspaper, looked at all the drugs approved by NICE since 2000, covering a total of nearly 300 treatments including those for cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and heart problems. When making its decisions, NICE classifies drugs into two groups. Those which would be used on their own undergo ‘single’ appraisals, while those which are taken with another drug are subject to ‘multiple’ appraisals. These take several years longer. Delays: A major study found that on average it takes the NHS rationing body NICE five years to give approval to a treatment after its launch . In 2010, the most recent year for which figures are available, the average delay for the 11 drugs which were approved after multiple appraisals was 10.2 years. They included treatments for arthritis, hepatitis C and Crohn’s disease, a debilitating bowel disorder. The average delay for multiple drugs given the green light in 2005 was 8.7 years. They included treatments for bowel cancer (irinotecan and oxaliplatin) and cancer of the womb (topotecan and pacilitaxel). In 2006 NICE approved three Alzheimer’s drugs, Aricept, Reminyl and Exelon, although only for patients in the ‘moderate’ stages of the disease. These treatments would have been classified as multiple appraisals, and that year the average time these assessments had taken was 7.8 years. Delays: Patients can get drugs that have not yet been approved by NICE by paying privately or applying to the Cancer Drugs Fund, but doctors are often reluctant to approve them . Last night Andrew Chidgey of the Alzheimer’s Society said: ‘People with all types of dementia desperately need effective treatments to live a better quality of life and stay independent for longer. ‘Five years is a long time to wait. Whenever a new drug is available, NICE guidance should be issued as quickly as possible.’ Heather Walker of Cancer Research UK said patients needed effective drugs ‘swiftly’ and added: ‘There needs to be a balance between giving NICE enough time to make the right decisions and ensuring that drugs get to patients as soon as possible.’ Dr Anita Sharma, a senior GP in Manchester, said: ‘Being too busy to appraise a drug is not acceptable.’ NICE’s role includes drawing up public health guidelines such as how NHS trusts should tackle obesity. It also sets ‘quality standards’ which state how patients with a range of illnesses should best be treated. Earlier this year the watchdog took on yet another role and began drawing up guidelines on social care. It will shortly be issuing advice on how NHS staff should care for the elderly with dementia and vulnerable children. A spokesman from NICE said: ‘We don’t recognise most of the conclusions reached by the Office for Health Economics report which was published in January this year. ‘The report includes in its average figures some drugs that received their licences many years before NICE was established in 1999. ‘NICE has since been asked to appraise such drugs, but their inclusion in this report has skewed the average length of time elapsed from marketing authorisation to published NICE guidance quite considerably.’","Rationing body NICE is denying potentially life saving drugs because it is bogged down in other tasks, doctors claim .

After weeks of torrential downpours, the bank holiday weather will at least offer some respite from the rain. Instead of a soaking, most parts of the country will experience only light showers. But that’s where the good news ends, as temperatures remain stubbornly low – and there could even be light snowfall on northern high ground on Sunday when the mercury dips to -2c (28f) overnight. Chance of snow: Temperatures remain stubbornly low, and there could be light snowfall in Scotland and the north of England this bank holiday . Freeze: Parts of Britain could be seeing scenes like these that hit earlier this year as the normally warm Atlantic air that heats the UK in May is forced out by a band of freezing air . Elsewhere, daytime temperatures tomorrow will linger around 10c (50f) in both the South and the North, rising to 11c (52f) in both regions on Sunday. Monday will be slightly warmer in the South, with highs of 13c (55f), but around 10c (50f) in the North. Met Office forecaster Sarah Holland said: ‘It will be quite chilly throughout the weekend with low-level cloud and patchy light rain. It will be a lot drier than we have seen this week. But next week will see more unsettled weather, with rain returning from Tuesday.’ It is usually around 16c (61f) at this time of year. The Met Office say temperatures will get back to normal by the middle of May. Seaside resorts say the chilly bank holiday will cost them millions of pounds. Bournemouth area hospitality association chairman, Andrew Woodland, said: ‘Visitor spending will be down by around £1million this weekend due to the weather, with hotels at just average occupancy, around 70 per cent. Last-minute visitors will feel it’s best to stay at home and do the DIY rather than get wet down here.’ It is also bleak news for farmers and food lovers after the wettest April for 100 years hit the asparagus harvest. Growers usually start cutting the green spears by the end of April, but so far hardly any have appeared, forcing supermarket prices up from £6 to £10 per kilo.

Police in Portland, Maine are looking for a Harvard Business School student who disappeared while celebrating his upcoming graduation. Nathan Bihlmaier, 31, was last seen by the Portland waterfront at Ri Ra, an Irish pub, around one o'clock Sunday morning. After scouring the marina, police still have no clues as to his whereabouts, causing his pregnant wife Nancy to rush to the coastal town. A piece of Mr Bihlmaier's clothing was found in the bay, and police say they are concerned about how close he was to the water when he was last seen after a night of heavy drinking. Vanished: Harvard student Nathan Bihlmaier, 31, was last seen by the Portland waterfront late on Saturday night. He is pictured with his wife, Nancy . Last seen: He and two friends had visited the Old Port area before Mr Bihlmaier vanished around 1am . Police told the Portland Press Herald that Mr Bihlmaier and two friends traveled to Portland for the weekend to celebrate their graduation from business school. The revelers visited the Old Port area on Saturday night, before Mr Bihlmaier was asked to leave the bar soon after midnight because he was drunk. Police confirmed that he had 'a little bit too much to drink', but added that he did not cause a disturbance while leaving the bar. 'At that point he left the bar very cooperatively,' police chief Michael Sauschuck said, according to the Bangor Daily News. 'There were no altercations - he just left voluntarily after being spoken to by bar staff.' He spoke to his friends on the phone, but did not return to the hotel where they were staying. They searched for him to no avail and reported him missing at 9am. Concerned: His pregnant wife, Nancy Hi Bihlmaier, rushed to the coastal city after receiving the news . 'He is a well-established individual from a strong family. He has a wife who is expecting their first child. There is no reason he would [purposely] go missing,' Lt Gary Hutcheson told the Press Herald. 'It's an unusual one.' According to his cell phone records, Mr Bihlmaier did not venture far. Police tracked his movements through his phone signal after he left the bar until his battery apparently died 40 minutes later. Divers scoured the marina, looking for clues to Mr Bihlmaier's location. Family: Mr Bihlmaier, originally from Kansas, with his wife Nancy and his parents Cheryl and Steve . The Coast Guard and the Portland harbormaster worked together with police to launch the underwater hunt for clues. They even used a cadaver dog on an inflatable raft to search for the man's scent. On Monday afternoon they found an item of his clothing in Casco Bay not far from the bar where he was drinking. Mr Sauschuck said: 'We do have some divers in the water, and that concern is really just to look at all options. 'It’s certainly a possibility that Nate could be lost in our fair city, or maybe caught a ride somewhere, but given the information we have at hand, we are concerned with the proximity of the waterfront to where he was last seen.' Mystery: Police tracked him after he left Ri Ra, pictured, until his phone battery died 40 minutes later . His pregnant wife, Nancy Hi Bihlmaier, rushed to the coastal city after receiving the news that her husband was missing, as did around 20 of his business school friends. Mr Bihlmaier is due to graduate from Harvard Business School this Thursday. 'He is from a strong family. His wife is expecting their first child. There is no reason he would go missing.'Lt Gary Hutcheson . A spokesman for the school told the Press Herald: 'His friends describe him as really one top-notch guy.' He continued: 'We do remain hopeful, despite signs to the contrary. It's important if anybody saw him, we want to hear about it.'

He has previously worked at several other healthcare firms, as well as for the Department of Health and Human Services.","Nathan Bihlmaier, 31, was celebrating graduation at Irish pub when he was asked to leave for being too drunk .

One in eight deaths of UK adults under the age of 64 is caused by alcohol, an international conference on tackling problem drinking has heard. The social cost of alcohol abuse has been estimated to be £240 a year for each European, with the annual bill for the NHS alone being £2.7 billion. A major conference of addiction specialists from across the world is meeting at Newcastle University and organisers have called for England to follow Scotland and set a minimum price per unit. They have also demanded a ban on advertising alcohol. Too easy to splurge: Prof Eileen Kaner from Newcastle University said the government had to be bolder about tackling cheap alcohol . Professor Eileen Kaner cited new research which showed one in eight UK deaths of people aged 15 to 64 was caused by alcohol. In Europe, alcohol consumption is more than twice the global average and it represents the biggest addiction in the UK, greater than any illegal drug or gambling. The conference has heard that the cost per capita in Europe is around £240 when the bill for health, welfare, crime and reduced output is calculated. Professor Kaner, who is director of the Institute of Health and Society at Newcastle University, said: 'Alcohol costs the UK so much in so many ways, both in financial and social impacts. 'Governments need to have a clear and unbiased view of the most up-to-date research on alcohol problems and be bolder about tackling some of the root causes such as overly cheap alcohol and irresponsible marketing that encourages heavy drinking. 'This conference will hopefully help inform the debate and highlight key measures governments should be taking to improve public health and safety around drinking behaviour.' Britain has one of the highest drinking rates in the world, figures collected last year have revealed. The average drinker in the UK has 15-and-a-half litres of pure alcohol a year - the equivalent of 775 pints of beer. That's the same as 500 glasses of strong wine or 1000 shots of whisky or other spirits. Only eastern European countries such as Russia, Croatia and Estonia drink more. Although Britain's overall alcohol consumption was 13th highest in the world behind former Soviet Bloc countries, it drinks the fourth highest amount of beer in the world. The research was carried out by the World Health Organisation (WHO) which measured alcohol consumption between 2000 and 2005. Dr Ala Alwan, WHO Assistant Director-General for Non-communicable Diseases and Mental Health said: 'Many countries recognize the serious public health problems caused by the harmful use of alcohol and have taken steps to prevent the health and social burdens and treat those in need of care. 'But clearly much more needs to be done to reduce the loss of life and suffering associated with harmful alcohol use.' She felt there was growing agreement between the public and policy-makers that something must be done. 'I think there is more political will than we have ever known and the public are alive to this debate and receptive to the idea that it is part of the government’s responsibility,' she said. She believed the most cost-effective way of reducing the harm caused by alcohol would be to reduce demand by banning advertising and implementing a minimum price per unit. The Scottish Government announced on Monday it would implement a 50p per unit minimum charge. Professor Peter Anderson, who specialises in alcohol and addiction policies at the universities of Newcastle and Maastricht, said stricter regulations on drink were being discussed by governments across the EU. He said: 'If England really introduces a minimum unit price, other countries will be persuaded to follow. At the moment it is a waiting game.' He said Finland was in the process of strengthening its advertising laws, while in France, alcohol adverts cannot be shown on television or in the cinema. The ALICE RAP (Addiction and Lifestyles in Contemporary Europe - Reframing Addictions Project) conference in Newcastle, involves 150 researchers from across the globe who help to shape addiction policy internationally.",Addiction experts call on England to follow Scotland's lead and set a mimimum price per unit of alcohol .

Callous: Stephen Whittaker, 37, befriended the family of a dying baby, just to steal from their charity appeal . A conman motivated by 'nothing more than greed,' callously befriended the family of a dying baby, just to steal from their charity appeal. Stephen Whittaker, 37, even went to the extraordinary lengths of taking part in a sponsored bike ride, but never handed over a penny of the estimated £800 he raised. Not content with ripping off one family, the Wythenshawe dad-of-two was also conning two other major charities. They believe he could have been raking in £400 a day tricking kind-hearted shoppers by waving buckets outside supermarkets saying he was collecting for The Christie hospital and Barnado’s - often with his young son in tow. It has emerged he could have been staging the con for at least three years. It will never be known exactly how much Whittaker stole - but police believe it runs into thousands of pounds. Whittaker, of Felton Avenue, Benchill, pleaded guilty at Manchester magistrates’ court to three charges of theft. The family of Tyler Furness - who was born three months premature at Stepping Hill Hospital - were there to watch him brought to justice. As he walked out of court, Tyler’s furious grandfather thrust a photograph of his grandson into Whittaker’s hands, shouting: 'This is who you stole from.' A shame-faced Whittaker stared at the floor as he was bailed for sentencing. Tyler, from Buxton, died from chronic lung disease at 13 months, shortly after Whittaker was arrested. Whittaker first hit upon the callous plot after seeing a charity poster in Wythenshawe hospital. He said he wanted to help raise money for its neonatal unit which cared for Tyler via their charity the Light At The End fund. But after meeting the family and taking part in their sponsored bike ride he pocketed an estimated £800 in donations. Generous: Baby Tyler was born three months premature at Wythenshawe Hospital so his family decided to raise funds for the neo-natal unit to help other patients . The fundraising manager at Wythenshawe Hospital called police after it became clear Whittaker hadn’t handed over any of the money. He initially lied and said he had handed in a smaller amount of money to a security guard prompting a full investigation by the fundraising office. But when questioned by police he eventually confessed to stealing the sponsorship cash. As police began investigating, it emerged he had stolen thousands from other charities including Barnado’s, where he had been working as a volunteer, and The Christie. He asked for official charity buckets and was seen outside ASDA and Tesco supermarkets in Wythenshawe collecting money. Distraught: From left - Tyler's grandmother, Tracey Furness, his mother Kelly Gilbride and his grandfather, John Furness. The family said they felt 'repulsed to have welcomed him to our home' Whittaker also told the charities he was doing other sponsored bike rides to raise money. But the only money ever banked by Whittaker to any charity was £358 which he gave to The Christie after he was repeatedly questioned. Tyler's grandmother said Whittaker's deceit added further pain to their already overwhelming grief. Tracey Furness told how she feels ‘violated and repulsed’ after being taken in by the serial conman. She founded the Light At The End fund for neo-natal units with her son Nathan, 22, and daughter-in-law Kelly Gilbride, 21, shortly after Tyler's birth. When Whittaker asked to take part in the sponsored ride Tracey said she was dubious about allowing a stranger to join the ride and insisted he came to meet the family at their home in Buxton. Tragic: Baby Tyler, from Buxton, died from chronic lung disease at 13 months, shortly after Whittaker was arrested . Jobless Whittaker, who is believed to claim around £1,800 a month in benefits, told them he had done lots of charity work previously because ‘he wanted to give back to society’. Tyler's grandfather John Furness, 54, even told how he and others bought Whittaker drinks during the 150-mile coast to coast trip because he was on the dole. He joined the Furness family and eight friends on the ride at the end of September last year. Tracey Furness said: 'All the family were devastated by the revelation that Whittaker had targeted us, impudently participated in cycling 150 miles, exploited members of the public and then self-indulged with innocent victims’ money. 'I personally feel violated and repulsed to have welcomed him to our home and to aid our cause.' The police officer who investigated Whittaker’s charity thefts said the conman was ‘motivated by nothing more than greed’. Pc Phil Gurton, from the Northenden neighbourhood team, led the probe into Whittaker’s scam. After Whittaker denied the allegations a crucial piece of evidence was handed over by Whittaker’s former partner. While being questioned at his home she overheard Whittaker claiming he had no record of his donations and gave Pc Gurton a sponsorship form full of pledges. The officer went on to interview hundreds of kind-hearted people on the lists. Pc Gurton said: 'The actions of Whittaker are that of an individual who was motivated by nothing more than greed. 'Whittaker took advantage of the public’s generosity and we have no doubt that in all cases he collected a lot of money and kept it.' He also stressed the public should not let Whittaker’s actions put them off giving to charity. The three charities ripped off by Whittaker last night hit out at his disloyal, sickening and callous actions. Sick plot: Whittaker first hit upon the callous plot after seeing a charity poster in Wythenshawe hospital - they said they were upset Whittaker's theft has 'soured' the fundraising efforts for baby Tyler Furness . During his scam Whittaker took money meant for Barnado’s, The Christie and a Wythenshawe Hospital appeal. Samantha Howarth, a community fundraiser with Barnado’s, said he had been volunteering at a Barnado’s shop in Wythenshawe town centre when he asked if he could have some collection buckets to start raising more money in the streets. He also said he was planning to do a sponsored bike ride from Edinburgh to Manchester. It’s not known whether he ever completed the ride but Samantha says he told her he was aiming to raise up to £5,000. She believes he may have pocketed at least half that amount. Samantha said: 'He was very active - he was always out and about collecting. It is so sad. I was really disappointed when I found out.' Jan Owen, fundraising coordinator at Wythenshawe Hospital, said she is upset that Whittaker’s theft has ‘soured’ the fundraising efforts for baby Tyler Furness. And a spokeswoman for The Christie said: 'It is even more of a shame considering we are fortunate enough to have thousands of very loyal hard working fundraisers.' Whittaker will return to Manchester crown court for sentencing on June 14.","Stephen Whittaker, 37, was caught after his ex-partner gave police a list of his donation pledges which he claimed he did not own .

Artificial light is essential for modern societies to function, but doctors fear our 24/7 culture could have unintended consequences for human health. The American Medical Association has just voted to accept the recommendations of a report that recognises exposure to light from street lamps to TV screens is linked to sleep disorders. The AMA added that is supported further study into the possible link between keeping lights on all the time with cancer and obesity, as well as exacerbation of chronic diseases such as diabetes. Artificial light exposure is higher now than ever due to our 24/7 culture and reliance on technology . Cancer epidemiologist Professor Richard Stevens from the University of Connecticut, said: 'It is a recognition by a major health body, the American Medical Association, that this is an emerging environmental issue that has a potentially large impact on the health of society. 'Based on an accumulation of evidence, this august body is now making the statement: ‘We take this seriously, and the public should take it seriously too.' Professor Stevens is credited with being the first to articulate the hypothesis that the increasing use of artificial light at night may be related to the high breast cancer risk in the industrialized world. 'There’s no question that this light at night changes our physiology in the short term,' Stevens says. 'We know that artificial light disrupts circadian rhythms. We’re learning more and more about the specifics of what that means. The clearest evidence is about the hormone melatonin. We’re lowering it, we’re even suppressing it completely, depending on the amount of light.' Melatonin has been shown to inhibit breast cancer in laboratory rats. Stevens is careful to say that the changes in human physiology from artificial light, circadian disruption and melatonin suppression have not been proven to cause breast cancer. Instead he offers a judicial analogy: . 'It’s guilty in a civil trial, but no verdict in a criminal trial. A reasonable jury would say there is a preponderance of evidence, but it’s not beyond a reasonable doubt at this point.' The adoption of the AMA council report’s . recommendations by the association could mean more federal funding for . studies into the health impact of . artificial light at night.

The TV ad, screened in February ahead of Ladies’ Day at the Cheltenham Festival, stated: 'We’re going to make Ladies’ Day even more exciting by sending in some beautiful transgendered ladies. Spot the stallions from the mares.' The ad showed a series of brief shots of people at the event while the voiceover attempted to guess their gender. In one scene a woman was shown holding a dog while the voiceover stated 'woman' then hesitated while the shot changed to show a woman walking out of a men’s toilet and stated 'dog, I mean man'. Scroll down for video . 'Offensive': Bookmaker Paddy Power encouraged harmful discriminatory behaviour towards the transgender community with an ad inviting viewers to spot the 'stallions' from the 'mares', it was ruled today . Degrading: Transgender campaigners criticised the ad, which here shows one of the 'transgender ladies' leaving the men's toilets . The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) received 92 complaints that the ad was offensive and condoned and encouraged harmful discriminatory behaviour. Paddy Power said it consulted the Beaumont Society, which it understood was the largest and longest established transgender support group in the UK, to ensure the ad met broadcasting and decency standards. It did not intend to cause harm or offence and was 'saddened' to learn that some viewers were offended by the ad, but believed that the complaints had come from an organised campaign. The Beaumont Society told the ASA that the script it had been given did not include the scene in which a woman left a men’s toilet and was referred to as a dog, and that it was not happy with the manner in which the terms 'stallions' and 'mares' were used in the finished ad. Upholding the complaints, the ASA said the suggestion that 'trans people' could be segregated into the gender stereotypes 'stallions' and 'mares' as part of a guessing game trivialised a complex and difficult issue and objectified them in a way that was likely to cause them serious offence. It said: 'We considered that the ad trivialised a highly complex issue and depicted a number of common negative stereotypes about trans people. 'We considered that by suggesting that trans women would look like men in drag and that their gender could be speculated on as part of a game, the ad irresponsibly reinforced those negative stereotypes and, particularly by framing the game in a way that involved a member of the public who had commented on Paddy Power’s Facebook page, the ad condoned and encouraged harmful discriminatory behaviour and treatment.' It ruled that the ad must not be shown again in its current form. The TV ad screened in February, ahead of Ladies' Day at the Cheltenham Festival (pictured) No stranger to controversy: This Paddy Power advert, which showed a blind footballer kicking a cat, was the most complained about ad of 2010 . A Paddy Power spokesman said: 'We are disappointed with the ASA ruling on our Ladies’ Day commercial. 'This decision is especially frustrating given that the commercial was pre-approved by British television advertising clearance body Clearcast who then considered the humour in the advert, while not to everyone’s taste, fell short of causing offence. 'Additionally, we reached out to leading UK transgender group, The Beaumont Society, for feedback on the script. Furthermore, we exclusively cast members of the trans community in the various transgender roles in the commercial. 'Finally, it is worth pointing out that the commercial has almost 600,000 views with twice as many ""likes"" than ""dislikes"".'","The TV ad, screened in February, showed a series of brief shots of people at Ladies' Day at the Cheltenham Festival while the voiceover attempted to guess their gender .

More than a third of British expats in Spain and Greece are selling up to escape the Euro crisis, it has emerged. Research shows that 39 per cent of Brits who own property in Greece are trying to sell, while 34 per cent who live in Spain have put their houses on the market. The findings, from the foreign exchange broker HiFX, comes after separate research last week revealed that the number of UK owners making enquiries about selling eurozone homes this year is up 191 per cent on the same period in 2008. Idyllic: The view might be spectacular and the weather warm but the euro crisis is causing ex-pat Brits to think of leaving Spain . HiFX's marketing director Mark Bodega said: 'If Greece were to exit the Euro and return to the drachma, we would expect their property to immediately devalue by anything up to 50 per cent.' Britons who have already agreed a sale could also lose out when the sale value of their property in Euros is converted to sterling, Mr Bodega said. Lesley Wilton, 56, lives with her husband Patrick Tetlow, 57, and their children Oscar, 13, and Daisy, 12, near Marbella. The family has lived there for the past 11 years but are now contemplating a return to Britain because they are struggling to make ends meet. Their property is on sale for 300,000 euros (£242,000) - 40,000 euros less than they paid for it nine years ago. Ms Wilton told The Sunday Times: 'Every time the pound strengthens against the euro the potential savings we will have to take back to England go down.'

Tara Ghale, 44, has not had a single viewer since her Marbella home went on sale 240,000 euros last year. Ms Ghale, who lives with her daughter Calypso, 15, told the newspaper: 'What's happening with the euro is a worry. 'It will become a real concern the moment I get an offer on the house. 'I need money to have a chance of starting afresh in the UK.' She added: 'The thought I may have to start again with nothing if my pounds pot is diminished is very demoralising. 'I fear for the future.' Fears for the future: Tara Ghale, 44, may be forced to return to Britain because if the harsh economic climate in Spain . The credit crunch in 2008 has already force Louise Hynd, 44, to relocate from Dassia in northern Cyprus to London. Ms Hynd, who built the property, said: 'I was set up in my lovely house but I lost all my buyers.' France has not been hit as hard by the euro crisis as Greece or Spain but nevertheless property values are still falling and affecting expats. Mr Bodega said: 'A typical home in France priced at 250,000 euros would have cost £213,000 on February 24 while now, ten weeks later, it would cost just £200,800.' Besides falling property prices, may ex-pats in Spain have been falling behind with their mortgage payments and having their homes repossessed because of the country's economic meltdown.

The next day he underwent an operation to have it removed and he returned to Britain to recuperate. But a follow-up scan revealed the cancer had spread to Lance Corporal McMullen's lymph nodes in his stomach and doctors warned him it was growing. He underwent immediate chemotherapy and radiotherapy and after a nine-week course of gruelling 16 hours-a-day treatment the cancer stopped spreading. He is now waiting to have a scan to confirm the cancer has gone.

'It was serious stuff, I was devastated at missing the birth of my little boy but I knew I had to have the treatment otherwise he wouldn't have a dad.

"By . Chris Parsons . PUBLISHED: . 10:41 EST, 22 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:41 EST, 22 May 2012 . An aspiring teen football coach and his 18-year-old accomplice who videoed their sexual assault on a 'vulnerable' drunk 14-year-old girl have been jailed for just three years each. Teejay Walker, 17, and David Lingard, 18, abused the young teenage girl when she was in a 'drunken stupour' at a New Year's Eve party in Burnley this year. Lingard, then 17, had intercourse with the girl, despite her being 'clearly unconscious', while Walker photographed the incident on his mobile phone as the pair'clearly enjoyed' the abuse. Abusers: Teejay Walker, 17, left, and David Lingard, 18, right, carried out the sexual abuse on the 14-year-old girl despite her being 'clearly unconscious' A judge told the pair they 'chose to ignore the standards of morality' in abusing the girl by laughing and posing as they recorded the sexual assault. Walker was even said to have threatened to to post the photos of the incident on the internet, Burnley Crown Court heard. The duo are able to be identified after Judge Lunt ruled there should be no reporting restrictions on their names because they are 'not children but young men'. Police only became aware of the 'horrible' abuse when the victim told a teacher at her school what had happened. Lingard and Walker both from Burnley, admitted sexual activity with a child, sexual assault and taking indecent photos of a child and were each sentenced to three years and four months. Judge Beverley Lunt allowed identification of Walker and Lingard after ruling they were 'young men, not children' Both will be on the sex offenders’ register indefinitely. Lawyers for Walker applied for a court order banning him from being publicly identified as he is under 18. But Judge Lunt, 58, refused and told the boys:'You both knew the girl was clearly under the influence of alcohol and was vulnerable and a non custodial sentence would be wholly against the interests of justice. 'You are not children. You are young men. You chose to ignore standards of morality and the law and to commit these offences.' Earlier Mark Savill, prosecuting, said the offences took place at a house in Burnley on January 1 this year. Walker and Lingard got into bed and asked the victim to get in with them. She was wearing clothes at that point and the teenagers started to undress her. The prosecutor said : 'She puts herself as very, very, very drunk at this point.' Walker then performed a sex act on the girl and Lingard had sex with her. At this point the girl became aware Walker was taking photographs. One of the pictures was a level 4 indecent picture - just one below the most serious level - and showed Lingard having sex with the schoolgirl. Three others were taken later and showed the boys showing off their private parts and' a young woman who is plainly unconscious.' In mitigation for Lingard, defence counsel Martin Hackett said alcohol was not used by either defendant to facilitate the offence. The barrister continued : 'His actions in the early hours of Jan 1 this year were, and indeed are, wholly out of character for this young man. 'He will now have to face his punishment for his disgraceful and serious behaviour over that short period of time. 'This was a one-off offence, a bad and serious offence, an offence which will mean he loses his liberty, but the sentence could be kept as short as possible. His parents are devastated at their son’s behaviour.' Burnley Crown Court heard Walker and Lingard 'both knew the girl was under the influence of alcohol and vulnerable' James Heyworth, defending Walker, said :' This is wholly and exceptionally out of character for him. 'There is no real explanation for what happened. It happened. It was horrible, he is sorry for what he has done. He cannot turn back the clock. He cannot put it right.' Mr Heyworth said character references spoke of Walker as being 'kind and generous’. He had wanted to be a football coach, but that would not now happen.","Teejay Walker and David Lingard abused young teen despite her being 'clearly unconscious'

"By . Rebecca Camber . PUBLISHED: . 07:08 EST, 21 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:46 EST, 22 May 2012 . Julie Middleton's son Regan died at six weeks but his brain was kept in a jar for 13 years by request of the police . Hundreds of body parts taken from victims of suspicious deaths have been kept needlessly by police for more than 50 years without their families knowing. Relatives reacted with fury to the revelation that forces stored 492 body parts and organs, some taken as long ago as 1960. Police chiefs disclosed yesterday that organs such as hearts, brains and limbs had been left in police stations, hospitals and mortuaries after being forgotten long after the criminal investigation concluded. In a scandal that has revived painful memories of the retention of infants’ organs at Liverpool’s Alder Hey Children’s Hospital, police failed to inform relatives at the time that organs had been removed. In some cases, families are still being kept in the dark. The true number of human tissue samples being kept is likely to run into thousands. Police have revealed only the number of whole organs and ‘significant body parts’ retained unnecessarily years after the case was closed. Those required for ongoing criminal investigations or appeals were not counted in the audit. The calculation also failed to take  into account small tissue samples  and other material taken such as hair and fingernails. Avon and Somerset Police said their records indicated that 110 victims had been buried without various body parts. But the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) counted only two samples in its nationwide audit as the majority of the material did not constitute whole organs or ‘significant’ body parts. Forces are now contacting hundreds of bereaved families and in some cases are paying for new funeral arrangements so that the organs can be interred with the original remains. Stored: Brains, hearts and limbs were among the samples retained, ACPO found . But, controversially, some families may not learn the truth as forces can decide that the tissue sample is not significant enough if the case dates back more than five years. When asked whether families were aware that tissue had been retained, ACPO spokesman Debbie Simpson, deputy chief constable of Dorset, said: ‘It may well be a case by case basis’. She admitted that the true number of body parts could be far higher than the audit indicated, saying that the data was ‘just a snapshot in time’. The Police Service of Northern Ireland retained the most body parts with 71 cases recorded. The Metropolitan Police kept 39, Merseyside 37, Cambridgeshire 35 and West Midlands 30. The samples were taken following post-mortem examinations as evidence in cases involving suspicious or unexplained deaths. Records: Body parts were kept by police forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland . In Northern Ireland, some body parts were disposed of without the consent or knowledge of their families. ACPO was unable to provide details of other forces. Miss Simpson offered a belated apology to families after conducting a two-year review, although she insisted that forces had acted within the law. She said: ‘The police service has a duty of care towards the families of those who die in suspicious circumstances or in homicide cases, to ensure such cases are fully investigated while loved ones are treated with dignity and compassion.’ Helen Shaw of Inquest, a charity which advises the bereaved, said: ‘It’s outrageous that some families might not be told. This report will just make many families worried about whether their relatives’ organs have been kept. ‘The key issue in my experience is people feel very angry about not knowing and other people taking the decision for them based on whether the material retained is significant enough.’ Opening up: Police Service of Northern Ireland assistant chief constable George Hamilton (left) and the State pathologist for Northern Ireland, Professor Jack Crane, admitted last week that body parts had been kept . Some body parts retained by police in Northern Ireland were disposed of without the consent or knowledge of their families, according to Northern Ireland's Justice Minister. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) kept human tissue samples relating to 63 suspicious and unexplained deaths between 1960 and 2005. A helpline has been established for relatives of people whose body parts were kept. Stormont Minister David Ford said: 'The state pathologist has clarified to me that there were, in the past, occasions when human tissue was taken without the families' knowledge and subsequently disposed of without family consent or knowledge. 'To many that may seem a shocking statement.' The cases, including 23 attributed to the conflict, were discovered as part of a UK-wide audit. The Commission for Victims and Survivors set up the helpline. Mr Ford meets members of the Commission in a fortnight to consider matters raised by victims' families and any unanswered questions. Chairman of the Commission Brendan McAllister said: 'It is important now for this situation to proceed in an atmosphere of calmness.' He appealed to the community to remain sensitive to those who have lost someone through violence or in other tragic circumstances and who may be especially vulnerable to distress arising from this situation. He added: 'With regard to the emergence of disturbing information about the retention of body parts by agencies of the state, it is important that we remember the motivation of those involved, to serve the public by helping to determine the cause of death or by providing forensic evidence to help secure justice. 'Nevertheless, ours is a wounded society which is still vulnerable to the long reach of a violent past. 'These new revelations about the retention of body parts may cause victims, families or individuals to suffer new distresses and even suspicions.' Last week, Assistant Chief Constable George Hamilton apologised for the distress caused to families but said the PSNI had acted within the law. The body parts were retained as part of investigations and could include skulls and organs. ACC Hamilton added that until 2006 police were under no legal obligation to inform relatives but said he was not defending what happened, when no mechanism was in place to review what material was held. The Police Ombudsman, which investigates complaints against police, also stored body parts. Officers have been visiting affected families to advise them of their options. Mr Ford apologised for the distress caused to the bereaved families and confirmed that he will review support arrangements. 'I am committed to ensuring that the recommendations in today's national audit are implemented fully in Northern Ireland to ensure public confidence,' he said. He has contacted the Human Tissue Authority, Criminal Justice Inspection Northern Ireland and Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary to discuss the best approach and said the needs of the bereaved families must remain paramount. He added: 'I deeply regret the fresh pain that families have had to suffer since this issue became known. 'I appreciate that this is a very difficult time for those families. 'Although the retention of human tissue following a post-mortem without informing the families was common practice prior to 2006, I share the view expressed by ACC Hamilton that there is a great difference in acting legally and doing what is morally and ethically right.'","Forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland needlessly held brains, hearts and limbs, report finds .

Suspicion: William 'Clyde' Gibson is being held in connection with the murders of two women . Authorities said they have dug up human remains in the backyard of a southern Indiana man who is suspected of killing two women a decade apart. Police found the remains of what they believe is a third victim late on Friday night at the New Albany home of 54-year-old William 'Clyde' Gibson III, a convicted sex offender. The remains were later identified as those of Stephanie Marie Kirk, 35, of Charleston, Indiana, WDRB.com reported. Floyd County Prosecutor Keith Henderson said told the Courier-Journal in Louisville, Kentucky, that the remains may have been there for weeks or months. Her exact cause of death is still under investigation, authorities said. 'The fact is it is a serious matter,' Mr Henderson told the News and Tribune of Jeffersonville. 'We do have three individuals at this point.' Henderson didn't reply to a phone message left at his office on Saturday. Gibson is being held without bond at the Floyd County Jail in connection with the deaths of two women. Christine Whitis, 75, of Clarksville, was found strangled in Gibson's home last week, and Karen Hodella, 44, a hairdresser from Florida, was discovered near the Ohio River in Clarksville in January 2003. Gibson was arrested on drunken-driving charges last week after police spotted him driving Ms Whitis' car. Scroll down for video . Grim findings: Police found human remains in Gibson's back yard in southern Indiana identified as 35-year-old Stephanie Marie Kirk . Possible evidence: Police haul away some of the remains during the night . An officer at the jail said Saturday . that there was no record of any formal charges against Gibson. He also . said he didn't know if Gibson had a lawyer. The discovery of the remains came . hours after officials called off a search of the Ohio River, where they . had been looking for Stephanie Marie Kirk, who was last seen on March 25 . when she left a friend's New Albany home to meet a man at a bar. New Albany police Maj. Keith Whitlow had said that they were searching the river as a result of information developed in the Gibson case. Gibson carries a lengthy criminal record. Discovered: The remains in his yard were identified as Stephanie Marie Kirk, left, who was last seen March 25 when she left a friend's house; the body of Karen Hodella, right, was found near the Ohio River in 2003 . The Courier-Journal reported he was sentenced to seven years in prison after pleading guilty to robbery and sexual abuse in a 1991 attack on a woman at a mall in downtown Louisville. Court records show he fondled her and stole her purse after pushing her into a phone booth, and later he said he had been drinking and using cocaine. Records also show he had arrests for assault, wanton endangerment and driving drunk. In 1992, Gibson told a psychologist that 'it's hard to predict what I might do,' when he drinks heavily. But in 1999, a psychologist found Gibson was at 'low risk' for being arrested again as a sex offender. This week, prosecutors also charged Gibson with being a habitual offender, listing convictions on 10 charges in eight cases between 1992 and 2007. The Courier-Journal reported Gibson was discharged from the Army for bad conduct in 1979 and had spent a year in the military prison at Leavenworth, Kansas. Earlier search: Before discovering the remains, police were searching the Ohio River for Kirk's body . Prior search terms: Police said Kirk was last seen March 25 as she left a friend¿s home in New Albany to meet a man at a bar . Court records also describe Gibson as a well-liked, 'extremely shy' person who didn't know how to respond when introduced to people. They said he had borderline intelligence and was emotionally immature, The Courier-Journal said. Michelle Rucker, Hodella's oldest daughter, said Friday that her mother had been in Indiana visiting her boyfriend's family for less than a day when she called her family in Florida and asked for money for a bus ride home. She told her family that a 'nice man' was buying her drinks at a bar. 'We never heard from her again,' Ms Rucker said. 'She was in Indiana one night and was missing the next day.' Ms Rucker said the latest developments had reopened old wounds. 'My family is a train wreck,' she said.

Women who remain childless after seeking fertility treatment are significantly more at risk of being hospitalised for mental problems, a study has found. Researchers looked at data on 98,737 Danish women investigated for infertility between 1973 and 2008. Childlessness increased the risk of being hospitalised for a mental illness by 18 per cent . Over a period of 12.6 years, more than half the women had a baby. But those who did not were 18% more likely to end up in hospital being treated for a psychiatric disorder. In total, almost 5,000 of the whole population of women were hospitalised for mental conditions such as alcohol abuse, psychosis, depression, and obsessive compulsive disorder. Childlessness increased the risk of alcohol and substance abuse by 103%, and schizophrenia by 47%. It also raised the risk of eating disorders by 47%, although this result was not statistically significant. However, common problems such as depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder were not affected by fertility status. The findings were presented today at the annual meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Istanbul, Turkey. Dr Birgitte Baldur-Felskov, from the Danish Cancer Research Center in Copenhagen, who led the study, said: . 'The results suggest that failure to succeed after presenting for fertility investigation may be an important risk modifier for psychiatric disorders. 'This adds an important component to the counselling of women being investigated and treated for infertility.

Emily Horne, who dressed up as a man to pose as her seventh husband in order to obtain prescription medicine walks free from court . A serial bigamist who dressed up as a man and  posed as her seventh 'husband' in order to get prescription drugs, was spared a jail sentence today. Former glamour model Emily Horne, 33, cropped her hair and donned a baggy football shirt and trousers to con a doctor into giving her sleeping pills she was addicted to. She told medics she was her husband, Craig Hadwin, serving in the Navy at RNAS Yeovilton, Somerset. Horne, of Wells, Somerset, had 'married' him earlier in 2011 in a bogus ceremony in Scotland before using his name to dupe doctors into giving her sleeping pills. The 33-year-old has been jailed before for bigamy after she failed to divorce her first husband Paul Rigby - and went on to ‘marry’ six more husbands between 1999 and 2011. Horne admitted fraud after fooling her unsuspecting doctor and was sentenced for duping her GP into giving her prescription drugs in court in Taunton, Somerset. Judge Jonathan Barnes told her: 'You have come terribly, terribly close to being sent to prison. This will be the last chance. 'Fundamentally I think you are a sad figure with serious problems rather than a wicked person. I feel the interests of justice do not require that I send you to prison today.' He said she had breached a two-year . suspended sentence for bigamy from 2009 but said: 'You have not again . gone through a ceremony of marriage and you have disclosed the fact that . you are apparently even now still married.' He sentenced her to a community order . with a 12-hour nighttime curfew, seven days a week for 28 days, and 12 . months supervision. Prosecutor Nigel Askham said: 'She has a history of deception. She has used a number of aliases.' Emily Horne, who has worked as a glamour model in the past, admitted to dressing up as her seventh 'husband' in order to feed her addiction to prescription drugs . In January 2009 she was in court for 11 similar offences of obtaining prescription painkillers. Defence barrister Rebecca Bradbury said Horne was overcoming her addiction with the help of her GP and a loving partner and she is now living in an abandoned pub in Wells. Miss Bradbury said: 'She has really been incapable of being honest in these relationships. She has not had the courage or foresight to admit she is still married. 'She has not committed any further offences of bigamy.' She added Horne’s previous . supervision related to her relationships with men and how to conduct . these relationships and keep herself safe. 'This . is a woman who due to injury and her psychiatric history had been given . swathes of prescription medicine which she is now addicted to and has . come to use as a crutch.' Horne wore a black trouser suit to court and a black bandana with white anchors to cover her cropped hair. Chris Barrett, left, became her third husband after meeting Horne on a bus. They moved in with her second husband, Sean Cunningham, before he found out about her bigamy. Simon Thorpe, right, learned of Horne's bigamous ways when he discovered she had married two men during their two-year engagement . Horne, who has appeared in X rated films, is now living in an abandoned pub in Wells with her partner . Horne admitted two fraud allegations in Castle Cary in July and Yeovil in May after using fraudulent details to obtain prescription drugs. She has also asked for three other similar offences to be taken into consideration. At an earlier hearing the prosecution said Horne has an extensive medical history including her addiction to prescribed painkillers and sedatives and has used a string of aliases to trick health service professionals into handing over various drugs. In May she telephoned the NHS out of hours service claiming to be the sister of Accastes Hadwin ringing on her behalf to say she needed painkillers after she had been assaulted. She gave a false address but was prescribed diazepam and the same day, rang again claiming to be her sister in law, saying she was experiencing more pain and was prescribed codeine phosphate. After a failed attempt to get drugs from a GP’s surgery in Ilchester, she made an appointment for her husband to see a GP in Castle Cary. Further painkillers were given to her when she went to the A&E department at a Taunton hospital in July saying she was Cassie Hadwin. She said she had hurt her wrist in a fall, asked for her arm to be put in plaster and was prescribed co-codamol tablets for the pain. Horne is no stranger to courts because of her tangled marital status and was still subject to a suspended jail term imposed by a Manchester court in 2009. Horne's web of lies started soon after she married her first husband, Paul Rigby, in 1996 when she was 18. They split up after three months, however, and three years later she wed Sean Cunningham. Their relationship ended after a couple of months and she left him for his friend, Simon Thorpe - the man who had given her away at her wedding to Mr Cunningham. While Horne and Thorpe were engaged . she married another two men, Chris Barrett, who she met on a bus, and . James Matthews, who she met on a train where he worked as a conductor. It was at this time that Horne started working as a glamour model, appearing in X-rated films. When Horne refused to return to Matthews after walking out on him to live with one of his friends, he contacted police. Husbands four and five: James Matthews, left, and Ashley Baker, right, both fell under Horne's spell and both found out she was still married soon after their own weddings to her . She was jailed for bigamy in 2004 but three years after her release Ashley Baker fell under her spell. He stood by her for another 10 months despite her honeymoon confession that he was husband number five after she lied, telling him she had cancer. In 2010 she met IT worker Stuart Allen from Burnley and he soon became 'smitten' with the brunette who introduced herself as Max. She agreed to marry him, but when she went away for a few days to visit her father, he learned she had actually gone to the U.S. to marry policeman Fred Miller who she had met online. After just a few days into her honeymoon with husband number six, their marriage fell apart and Horne returned to England to live on benefits in Wareham, Dorset. In early 2011 she married her seventh husband, Mr Hadwin, at a ceremony in Scotland after meeting him on a dating website. Horne, who changed her name to Max Accastes Quiberon by deed poll in 2010, did not comment as she left the court.","Former glamour model Emily Horne cropped her hair and donned a .

Poppy Rodgers was found critically ill at a terraced house on a rundown housing estate during the early hours last Friday. She was taken to hospital but later died. The trainee beauty therapist is understood to have taken a yellowy-white powder, believed to be an amphetamine paste. Torn apart: Poppy, pictured, with her mother Ann-Margaret Rodgers. The trainee beauty therapist is understood to have taken a yellowy-white powder, believed to be an amphetamine paste . Her death prompted police to issue an urgent warning about the concoction as they conducted further tests to determine what exactly she took. Last night, her devastated family were being comforted by family liaison officers. Poppy Rogers died after taking the substance while at a house in York . A friend of the family said: ‘This is a very difficult time for all of them. It’s totally unexpected. ‘The family are all understandably devastated and this is very raw. Poppy was a loving, happy, well-liked young girl. But she was naive and stubborn. ‘I don’t know whether she got into the wrong crowd or what happened, we don’t know much at the moment. I don’t know whether she was friends with the people at the house or how she got to be there. ‘She wasn’t a little tearaway, she was a lovely young girl who was naive.’ The friend added: ‘This is a lesson for young people not to experiment with drugs.’ Her mother, Ann-Margaret Rodgers, is believed to have began a relationship with local artist Andy Hinkles, 45, after separating from Poppy's father . On a social networking site Poppy’s . mother writes: ‘I’m the proud Mummy of a beautiful daughter, without her . in my life the sun would never shine.’ She lives less than a mile from the . house where Poppy collapsed in the Tang Hall area of York. It is not yet . known if Poppy, a student at York College, went to the house party on . her own or with friends. Neighbours said the house was known for attracting trouble. The front window was boarded up last week after a sofa was hurled through it. Tributes: Twitter users have been taking to the internet site to pay tribute to 16-year-old Poppy Rodgers . On the evening Poppy died they said they heard loud music and fireworks being let off in the back garden of the property at about 10pm. Then, just after midnight, they heard the siren of an ambulance. Simon Moss, who lives opposite the house and is the chairman of the Tang Hall residents’ association, also reported hearing ‘a lot of police activity’. He said: There are always sirens going off here. It seems there is some kind of trouble more often than not. The fact that it is connected to drugs does not surprise me.’ Poppy formerly studied at Norton College and at King James’s School, in Knaresborough, North Yorkshire. A man of 21 who was taken to York Hospital, pictured, with Miss Rodgers has since been discharged . The school’s head Carl Sugden said: ‘We are all desperately saddened by this news. ‘Poppy was a well-regarded girl and was popular and had a good group of friends.’ A man of 21 who was taken to hospital with Miss Rodgers has since been discharged.

"By . James Tozer . UPDATED: . 05:52 EST, 14 July 2011 . A frail widow who served her country in the Second World War as a member of the Women's Land Army was left in bed with no food or water for more than three days after her carers failed to turn up. Beryl Carter, 85, suffers from severe dementia, and depends on carers visiting her home four times a day to get her up, dress her and provide for all her daily needs. But after an apparent mix-up when a new company took over providing home help for the local council, she was left lying helplessly in her filthy bed for three-and-a-half days until worried neighbours raised the alarm. Left alone: Beryl Carter, pictured here with her son Andrew, was left lying in her own home for three days after carers failed to turn up . By then she was badly distressed, had . lost weight and was suffering from dehydration, and later had to be . taken to hospital. She may now have to move into a care home. Yesterday her son – who at the time . had been preoccupied by his own nine-year-old boy who was in hospital – . said he was furious that she could have been so badly let down and . demanded to know what had gone wrong. The scandal comes just weeks after an . official investigation found that appalling standards of home care . provided by local councils amounted to a neglect of elderly people's . basic human rights. Some are routinely left in bed for 17 . hours a day, while many receive such short visits they have to choose . between being washed or given food, the Equality and Human Rights . Commission said. The Daily Mail has highlighted the . appalling treatment of older people by care workers in their own homes . as part of its Dignity for the Elderly campaign. Shocked: Beryl's son Andrew and his partner Debbie Howat said they were outraged by the mistake . Mrs Carter, who was a member of the . Women's Land Army before travelling the world with her RAF engine fitter . husband Robert, who died in 1992, moved into a bungalow after being . diagnosed with dementia ten years ago. Carers visited her home in Audenshaw, . Greater Manchester, four times a day, but she apparently slipped . through the net when the local council switched service providers. The old firm, Housing 21, visited Mrs . Carter as normal at about 9pm on July 3 before handing over the . contract to Care UK at midnight. However the new agency claims it was . not notified that the pensioner had been discharged from hospital a week . earlier following a blood transfusion. They only realised the blunder . when neighbours raised the alarm at lunchtime on July 7, and a carer was . dispatched, finding her in a distressed state. Her son Andrew, 45, . said: 'When I got the call, I just felt sick. 'I visit my mum but my nine-year-old . son had been in hospital at the time and we had taken our eye off the . ball a bit, but believed mum was being cared for as usual.' His partner, Debbie Howat, added: 'I was outraged that an old lady could have been treated like that. 'Beryl is only five-and-a-half stone . and had lost a lot of weight, her catheter had come out and she had been . lying like that for days without even a drink.' Mrs Carter was later . taken to hospital after her condition deteriorated, and her son believes . she may in future need round-the-clock care. 'We are all human, and I know . mistakes can happen, but this was a mistake which could have been fatal . and we don't want it to happen to anyone else,' said Mr Carter, a former . council worker. Yesterday Housing 21 said it had . notified Tameside council's social services department that Mrs Carter . was back home, but Care UK said this information hadn't been passed to . it when the new contract began. Last night Lynn Travis, the council's . executive member for adults' services, said: 'An investigation is . taking place to ascertain the facts concerning the transfer of care . arrangements specifically relating to this case following the . retendering of its homecare services.' Last month's report into home care . highlighted a series of problems with an overstretched system where some . pensioners see dozens of different carers every fortnight, in many . cases visiting for just 15 minutes a day. Beryl Carter is one of Britain's . quiet heroines - a woman who fought to provide for her country during . the war, and for her family for the rest of her life. She . never expected any praise or favours. What she surely could have . expected in return for a life of service was to be spared the indignity . of lying in a filthy bed for three-and-a-half days, not knowing whether - . or even if - anyone was coming to help. Mrs Carter and her twin brother Victor were born in Stoke-on-Trent, the youngest of a large Victorian family. Adventure seeker: A younger Beryl in Libya in 1951, during one of her many trips around the world . When war broke out, she took her place in the Women's Land Army - working round the clock. Following the war, she met her future husband Robert and the pair married on January 22, 1949. Together they travelled the world as part of Robert's duties as an engine fitter for the RAF. Son Andrew said: ‘They visited dozens . of countries including Cyprus, Germany and North Africa. She would tell . me stories of going on shopping trips to Tripoli and Beirut with the . rest of the RAF wives. ‘Even to this day she shakes her shoes to make sure there are no scorpions hiding in them.’ Andrew, . the couple's only child, was born in 1966. He said: ‘My first memories . are of Germany because even though I was born in England I spent my . early childhood there until dad left the air force when I was five.’ The family relocated to Tameside, living in Denton on what is now the Crown Point North shopping centre. Home town: Mrs Carter lives in Audenshaw, Greater Manchester . Mrs . Carter took several jobs to help provide for the family - including . working in a factory and as a dinner lady at the nearby Russell Scott . Primary. Her . son said: ‘She wasn't afraid of hard work and always managed to get . herself a job. She worked right up until her retirement in the 1980s.’ Her . husband died in 1992 but Mrs Carter continued to live independently. She later moved to a bungalow after being diagnosed with dementia about . ten years ago. Andrew . said: ‘The dementia just sneaked up on us. Although she is now 85 and . battling several health problems, there is no doubt that her spirit . still shines through.’",Beryl Carter served her country during war in women's Land Army .

'It stinks': Sally Bercow is accused of exploiting her husband's position in accepting the 'dream job' offer in Barbados . She’s posed naked except for a bedsheet, with the Houses of Parliament as her backdrop. She’s taken part in Celebrity Big Brother, and made a tabloid TV show about her friendship with My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding star Paddy Doherty. She’s even admitted to being a former binge-drinker who had a string of one-night stands. You could be forgiven for thinking that Sally Bercow has already caused her husband, Commons Speaker John Bercow, enough embarrassment. But now she has given him a fresh headache after accepting a celebrity public speaking engagement, which she said came with a fee of ‘about £2,000’ and a trip to the West Indies. The Institute of Travel and Tourism offered her the ‘dream job’ just weeks after her husband allowed the organisation to host a Christmas cocktail party in his official Commons apartment. One Tory MP said the arrangement ‘stunk’ – and accused 42-year-old Mrs Bercow of profiting from her position. Last night, the attention-loving Mrs Bercow claimed her £2,000 fee for the hour-long talk was ‘not a fortune’ – but admitted she leapt at the chance to address delegates at the five-star Barbados Hilton. She told The Mail on Sunday: ‘They said, “Will you come and speak in Barbados? We will pay for your flights and accommodation.” ‘I thought about it for five seconds and said, “Yes, please, I’ll bite your arm off.” I’m not crazy.’ She added that she was unaware whether the flights would be business class, saying: ‘No idea. It doesn’t matter to me. I am quite happy to go economy. ‘I’ll take what I’m given.’ The offer to Mrs Bercow came after the trade body was permitted to hold two Christmas parties at Mr Bercow’s grace-and-favour Westminster home, one in 2010 and another last year. At the 2010 event, Mr Bercow himself reportedly put in an ‘unexpected’ appearance and showed guests the apartment’s ceremonial four-poster bed. Mrs Bercow has previously spoken of how ‘sexy’ the flat feels. Last night, Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance campaign group, said: ‘It is good that the Speaker uses his position to encourage the British tourist industry, but he and his wife need to be very careful not to put themselves in a position where the appearance is given that they are getting an advantage for helping this organisation.’ One Tory MP privately accused Labour-supporting Mrs Bercow of profiting from her privileged position, saying: ‘I’m afraid this looks as though she’s getting work on the back of events being held at her husband’s official residence. It stinks.’ Mrs Bercow hit back, saying there was ‘nothing dodgy’ about the offer of what she admits is a dream job. She said she had never attended an ITT event, and the offer came on the back of her Channel 5 documentary with Mr Doherty, an Irish traveller. She added that it was ‘nonsense’ to bar her from getting work from organisations that have held events in the apartment where she lives with the Speaker and their three children. She said: ‘To say I can’t make a living or earn any income from completely independent approaches from organisations that happen to have been into Parliament is ridiculous.’ Lap of luxury: The five-star Barbados Hilton, where Mrs Bercow will give her speech . Sun, sea and sand: Mrs Bercow said she had to think about the Barbados job offer for 'about five seconds' before accepting the position . Mrs Bercow said the engagement in Barbados would be her debut on the lucrative international speaking circuit. In taking it, she is following in the footsteps of Tony Blair’s wife Cherie, who addressed the conference three years ago. Advance publicity for the £485-a-head event in June says: ‘Sally will give her take on being an independent woman balancing a career with family life whilst living in the goldfish bowl of Westminster.’ By coincidence, Mrs Blair’s book about life in No 10 was called The Goldfish Bowl. The ITT blurb describes Mrs Bercow as an ‘outspoken member of the Labour party’ and adds: ‘Her experiences, media controversies and thoughts on Parliament, politics and politicians making the news will be well worth a listen!’ Mrs Bercow was unclear what she was supposed to talk about, but asked if it would involve any tourism expertise, she said: ‘Oh god, no.’ Last night, ITT chairman Steven Freudmann insisted there was no connection between the events held at Speaker’s House, which were charity fundraisers, and hiring Mrs Bercow. A spokesman for Mr Bercow said he had ‘no involvement with his wife’s professional diary’, adding: ‘Around 100 events are allowed in Speaker’s House each year for educational, charitable or Parliamentary purposes. The event in December 2011 was held to promote the Just A Drop charity. Neither Mr Speaker nor Mrs Bercow attended. ‘There is absolutely no connection between the event and the separate speaking invitation.’","Sally Bercow accepts travel firm job offer to give one-hour speech .

Taliban fighters armed with rocket-propelled grenades stormed a prison in north west Pakistan and freed 400 prisoners, it emerged today. The raid by more than 100 fighters was a dramatic display of the strength of the insurgency gripping the nuclear-armed country. Police said at least 20 of the inmates set loose were 'very dangerous'. Pakistani security officials stand guard outside the main prison in Bannu, where the Taliban armed with assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades attacked the jail . Authorities fear the escaped prisoners may now rejoin the fight, giving momentum and a propaganda boost to a movement that has killed thousands of Pakistani officials and ordinary citizens since 2007. The attackers battled their way into the prison before dawn in the city of Bannu close to the Afghan border and near Peshawar. Bannu prison superintendent Zahid Khan said they used explosives and hand grenades to knock down the main gates and two walls. 'They were carrying modern and heavy weapons,' said Mr Khan. 'They fired rockets.' Once inside the building, the attackers headed straight to the area of the prison where death-row prisoners were being kept, he said. Police officer Shafique Khan said they fought with guards for around two hours, setting part of the prison on fire before freeing the 380 inmates, including at least 20 'very dangerous Taliban militants'. The raid took place in Bannu district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province in the early morning hours . Miian Iftikhar Hussain, the provincial information minister, said the militants first set up the roadblocks around the prison and then broke in through the main gate . One escaped prisoner, Adnan Rashid, was on death row for his involvement in an assassination attempt against former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, said Zahid Khan. The prison in Bannu housed 944 inmates. A Taliban spokesman, Asimullah Mehsud, claimed the movement's fighters freed 1,200 of their comrades. The group is known to make exaggerated claims. Where the jail is . Pakistan's military has launched a series of operations against the Pakistani Taliban group in the northwest, where it is strongest and has forged alliances with al-Qaida and other transnational militant movements based there along the Afghan border. The movement is closely linked to the Afghan Taliban, which is battling U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan. Soldiers and police have killed or arrested hundreds of militants, but the insurgency has proved resilient. Insurgents have carried out suicide bombings and other attacks across the country in retaliation, raising doubts in some quarters over whether the county can survive. Prison breakouts like the one Sunday have been rare. Bannu city is the main gateway to North Waziristan, the most militant-infested region along the border.","Raid took place near the border with Afghanistan .

A woman desperate to become a mother died after a surgeon cut open her bowel during a procedure aimed at helping her to have children. The slit went unnoticed by medics at Birmingham Women’s Hospital and Pavla El Nahas died at her home in Birmingham, just over two days later. The 39-year-old had fatally inhaled vomit after becoming sick with bile seeping from the cut, an inquest heard. Pavla El Nahas married Sam in 2010. They had both longed for children and discussed baby names . Paramedics found Mrs El Nahas in bed, not breathing and without a pulse. They confirmed she died at just before 1am on June 23 last year. Her distraught husband, 30-year-old trainee security guard Sam, said after the hearing at Sutton Coldfield Town Hall: 'I was missing someone call me ‘dad’ and she was missing someone call her ‘mum’ - those were our dreams.' Mr El Nahas, added: 'We argued about having a son - I wanted to call him Abdul and she wanted to call him Youssef. 'I wanted blue eyes and she wanted brown eyes. We had great hopes. We weren’t bad people, why did this happen to her?' The couple met in Mr El Nahas’s native Egypt in 2006. He was a barman at the Sharm El Sheikh hotel where Pavla was staying on holiday. They married there two years later, before moving to England in 2010. However, after unsuccessfully trying for children the following year, TK Maxx warehouse worker Czech-born Mrs El Nahas was referred to the women’s hospital. Surgeons carried out a laparoscopy on June 20 last year, which is a minimally invasive procedure to explore her abdomen and pelvis. Medics said they could 'see nothing wrong' after the procedure. Grieving: 'We weren¿t bad people, why did this happen to her?' Mr El Nahas asked . Pathologist Dr Peter Acland, who carried out the post-mortem examination, said he discovered a gynaecological procedure carried out in the Czech Republic 'several years' earlier had resulted in Mrs El Nahas’s bowel fusing with abdominal wall scar tissue. This, he said, meant the usually free-moving organ wasn’t pushed away as the surgeon cut into Mrs El Nahas. Women’s hospital consultant obstetrician Dr Peter Thompson later told the hearing an internal investigation had cleared the surgeon of any wrongdoing and up to three in every 1,000 patients who had the procedure suffered such an abdominal perforation. Coroner Aidan Cotter ruled Mrs El Nahas died following elective surgery. He said: 'This does not mean that anybody did anything wrong, nor does it mean they didn’t do anything wrong.' He added: 'The surgery caused a small perforation in her bowel. That perforation later leaked and caused an infection. That infection made her very ill. 'Just that illness alone could and would have caused her death, but she actually died because while she was so very ill, some of her gastric contents came up and went into her lungs.' In a statement, Women’s Hospital NHS Trust chief executive Dr Ros Keeton said: 'The trust was saddened to hear of the death of Mrs El Nahas. A thorough investigation was launched and, while no problems were found with the medical care provided, we took the opportunity to review and improve communications with patients following surgery.'","Surgeons accidentally cut into Mrs El Nahas' bowel .

The Salvation Army has encountered its first trafficking victim brought in for organ removal (posed by model) A charity working with victims of human trafficking in Britain has faced its first case of a person being brought into the country for organ harvesting. An unnamed woman was brought into the UK by criminals operating a black market trade in body parts for transplant. New details were released today by the Salvation Army, which was awarded a contract by the Ministry of Justice to provide victims with safe accommodation, counselling, medical care, translation services and legal counselling. During the first six months of the contract, more than two fifths (41 per cent) of the people they worked with in England and Wales were male. The charity helped 112 women and 78 men between July 1 and December 31 last year, supporting them through their experiences and helping them rebuild their lives. Almost half (45 per cent) had been forced into sexual exploitation, while 43 per cent were trafficked into forced labour and eight per cent into domestic servitude. The police referred 44 per cent of the victims, with the south east of England accounting for more than half (54 per cent) of referrals. The majority of the 190 had come from eastern Europe (58 per cent), a quarter had been brought in from Africa and 12 per cent from Asia, while another four per cent had been trafficked from within UK borders. A survey conducted by YouGov also revealed the public's misconceptions about the face of human trafficking. Respondents thought 68 per cent of victims were sexually exploited - a much higher proportion than that seen by the Salvation Army - and that just 29 per cent of victims in England and Wales were male. Among the male victims helped by the Salvation Army were two men from the Czech Republic, who had been trafficked to the UK for forced labour after they answered a job advert in a national newspaper. The pair, who had thought they were being taken on as factory supervisors in England, told how they were sold numerous times between gangmasters within the UK. Crispin Blunt: The Minister for Justice said 'male victims are often overlooked' The Salvation Army gave the victims temporary accommodation and support until they were able to Scotland amd start a new life. One of them, named only as Aleksandr, said: 'I was given the number of The Salvation Army. 'They saved me and they took me to a police station, where I made a statement. 'That same day, we helped my friend to escape who had been trafficked the same way as me. 'The Salvation Army hid us in a safe house. 'It's sad but it's true: there are hundreds of people with similar stories to me, people who have been fraudulently bought and sold.' Major Anne Read, the Salvation Army's anti-trafficking response co-ordinator, said: 'Male or female, no matter where the victim is in England and Wales or the reason that they are trafficked, we are helping all people caught up in all types of trafficking to get them the support they need, when they need it. 'The Salvation Army has a strong track record of supporting victims of human trafficking and we are working with a wide range of experts in delivering the contract to ensure that specialist, individually tailored support is available to every victim. 'This includes gender-specific services and support for victims with disabilities and mental health needs.' Minister for Justice, Crispin Blunt, said: 'Human trafficking is often seen as predominantly affecting women - meaning that male victims are often overlooked and are forced to go without the support they so desperately need. 'The support The Salvation Army offer to trafficking victims, regardless of gender, was a key reason why they were awarded the contract. 'In the first six months of providing this service, The Salvation Army have shown that they are able to offer a high quality, tailored system of support to some of the most vulnerable victims, regardless of their country of origin, religion or gender.'","Salvation Army reports back on nearly 200 trafficked people it helped over six months .

Teenage girls who are on the Pill are at risk of having high blood pressure in later life, according to research. Scientists have found that even those who have been taking the contraceptive for only a few months have readings which are significantly higher than those of other girls. Doctors have long known that high blood pressure is one of several side-effects of the Pill but this is one of the first studies to show its effect on young girls within such a short space of time. Risk: Teenage girls who take the Pill are in danger of having higher blood pressure later in life (picture posed by model) Although the girls’ blood pressure was still within the healthy range, the Australian researchers are concerned that it may rise further when they get older, putting them at risk of heart attacks and strokes. High blood pressure is known as the ‘silent killer’ within the NHS as there are rarely any symptoms, but it gradually puts extra strain on the blood vessels and heart. If left untreated, it can lead to heart attacks, strokes, fatal blood clots or kidney disease. Side-effects: High blood pressure is known as the 'silent killer' within the NHS . Researchers from the University of Western Australia asked the teenagers a range of questions on their weight, diet, how often they drank alcohol and whether they smoked. Girls were also asked if they were taking the Pill. As they were only 17, it is probable most had not been on it for long. Normal blood pressure should be around 130/80 mm Hg, with anything over 140/90 mm Hg deemed high. For girls on the Pill, the first figure in this reading was already 3 mm Hg higher than others. Dr Chi Le-Ha, whose study is published in the European Journal of Preventative Cardiology, said: ‘Teenage girls taking oral contraceptives should be advised about regular blood-pressure monitoring.’",NHS have branded high blood pressure as a 'silent killer'

A mother almost died after losing an astonishing 12 pints of blood while giving birth to a boy weighing more than 11lbs. Rachel London, 29, is lucky to be alive after having a blood transfusion followed by emergency surgery at Ipswich Hospital just minutes after welcoming baby Jacob on April 7. She was only able to hold the newborn for a few moments before being rushed to theatre with a torn cervix and vaginal wall. Close call: Rachel London almost died after losing an astonishing 12 pints of blood while giving birth to baby Jacob. Also pictured is her daughter Eloise . There doctors performed a transfusion, but the mother-of-two continued to leak blood. She was then transferred to surgery where doctors operated to stem the blood flow. Her devastated husband Michael feared she would die after she lost over seven litres of blood, the equivalent of 12.3 pints. The average woman has eight to ten pints in her body. And baby Jacob, who weighed a hefty 11lb 2oz, was also fighting his own make-or-break battle. Seriously ill with a vomiting bug, the newborn was taken straight to the hospital's special care baby unit. Mrs London, who also has a three-year-old daughter, Eloise, has now saluted nurses, including midwife Geraldine Davies,  in the hospital's maternity ward for saving her life as well as her son's. Mrs London, of Ipswich, said: 'There were times when they didn't know if I would survive because I was losing so much blood. 'Without the nurses and doctors I wouldn't be here today - they were brilliant. I can't praise them enough for everything they did for me.' Survivor: Jacob, who weighed a hefty 11lb 2oz, was rushed straight to a special care baby unit seriously ill with a vomiting bug . She added: 'I was given a blood transfusion. But I was even losing that blood and in total doctors said I lost seven litres of blood - which is actually more than is in the average human body. 'It was all a bit of a blur because one minute I'm giving birth and the next I'm going through to theatre. 'My husband thought he was going to have to explain to our three-year-old daughter Eloise that her mummy wasn't going to come back.' Mrs London was kept in intensive care for two days before undergoing further surgery. She then spent three days recovering on the maternity ward. Jacob was transferred to Norfolk and Norwich Hospital to be assessed by specialists but was allowed to return to his mother's side after eight days. Nurses on the maternity ward even took pictures of Jacob in the special care baby unit so grateful Mrs London could see how her baby was coping. Maternity manager Frances Bolger said: 'It's great to hear Rachel and baby Jacob are doing so well. Their thanks means a lot to the team here who work incredibly hard every day to provide quality care to mothers and babies.' Mrs London also urged people to give blood to save lives all over the country. She said: 'It saved my life and it is so important because giving blood can save so many people. 'I didn't realise the importance of giving blood until this happened to me but now I would urge everyone to give blood.'","Average woman has 8 to 10 pints of blood in her body .

This is the moment when a father . thought he was seeing his son die as a hot air balloon burst into flames . after hitting 132,000-volt power cables. Watching from another balloon, Martin Griffiths feared the worst as 18-year-old Adam drifted into the overhead lines. As he landed in a nearby field, Mr Griffiths, 42, heard bolts of electricity blasting through the canopy of his son’s craft. Hit: This is the dramatic moment the balloon crashed into the cables and was set alight, caught on camera by bystander Rachel Smith at about 6pm on Sunday . Drama: Three teenagers were left suspended 15 metres above the ground as they waited for the overhead cables to be turned off . Then the small basket under the balloon containing Adam and his two companions was set ablaze by showers of sparks. Convinced that Adam had been killed, Mr Griffiths sprinted back to the scene. He added: ‘I had landed a couple of . fields along when I heard the bang. I thought Adam was dead. The basket . was on fire and he was stuck in the cables.’ As the passengers, Colin Giggle and a . girl aged 16 who has not been named, cowered in the bottom of the . 9ft-square basket, Adam doused the flames with a fire extinguisher. Adam . was unhurt, Mr Giggle suffered a burned shoulder and the teenager’s . hair was singed. Terrifying accident: Pilot Adam Griffiths, 18, suffered burns when he and two teenage passengers crashed into an electricity pylon, absorbing 132,000 volts . Then, after their brush with death, . the passengers – who had not been in a hot air balloon before – and . their pilot played I-spy as they dangled 45ft off the ground for five . hours waiting for the power to be switched off so they could be brought . down by rescue teams. Mr Giggle, 52, said they had to ‘curl . up like hedgehogs’ as they smashed into the wires, adding: ‘It was like . being inside a firework. There were a lot of sparks. ‘This sort of thing kills people – we were very lucky to walk away from the scene. ‘As we dropped below the wires we were . waiting for contact, thinking it would cause a spark. When the wires . twanged on the basket we did think, “This will hurt”. ‘The experience definitely used up one of my nine lives.’ Adam and his father were in two of six . balloons that had taken off together from a field at Riseley, . Bedfordshire, on Sunday afternoon. They had travelled about ten miles . when a gust blew Adam into pylons near Bozeat, Northamptonshire, just . before 6pm. Adam, from Rushden, Northamptonshire, said: ‘I did panic after hitting the wires. ‘There was quite a bang when we hit the power lines, and then I saw there was a fire in the basket. ‘It is all a bit of a blur really, but it was scary. ‘You go through all these things in . your training but it still doesn’t come into play until it actually . happens.’ And he added: ‘It won’t put me off flying balloons. I’ve been . doing it since I was a baby.’ Rescue: Emergency services had to wait until 11pm for the power to be turned off so they could get to the hot air balloon . Mr Giggle, himself an amateur . aeroplane pilot, said the waistcoat he had been wearing was ‘full of . holes on the back’ from where he was hit by ‘little gobbets of fire’. He added that the trio passed the time . with games as they waited for rescue. The marketing data manager said: . ‘We played I-spy. But after we had “g” for “grass” and “p” for “pylon” we didn’t have many more ideas. ‘The wind picked up and the basket was . moving to and fro, but there was nothing we could do. We did get very . cold, but you just cope.’ When they were rescued at 11pm, each of them was harnessed to a fireman who abseiled down the pylon. Hanging: The three passengers had to put out a fire started on impact with the pylon . Danger: Pilot Adam Griffiths and two others were forced to cower in the basket for five hours while waiting for the electricity to be turned off . The incident is being investigated by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch. However, Mr Griffiths believes a sudden change in wind direction caused the ‘freak accident’. He said the £25,000 Cameron N-77 . balloon had been destroyed in the accident, but added: ‘I’m just so glad . Adam’s all right. It could have been so much worse.’ Despite his ordeal, Mr Giggle is . determined to have another flight, joking: ‘I will be going up in a . balloon again as I want to experience a normal landing.’ Deflated: The balloon's limp outline is shown silhouetted against the Northamptonshire sky as it drapes over the power cables .

Gyanendra Shrestha, of Nepal's Mountaineering Department, said: ‘There was a traffic jam on the mountain on Saturday. Climbers were still heading to the summit as late as 2.30pm, which is quite dangerous.’ Climbers are advised to not attempt to reach the summit after 11am. The area above the last camp at South Col is nicknamed the ‘death zone’ because of the steep icy slope, treacherous conditions and low oxygen level. ‘With the traffic jam, climbers had a longer wait for their chance to go up the trail and spent too much time at higher altitude,' Shrestha said. 'Many of them are believed to be carrying limited amount of oxygen not anticipating the extra time spent' The three climbers who died Saturday were believed to have suffered high altitude cerebral oedema. The missing climbers are a Chinese national and his Nepalese Sherpa guide. Feat: Climbers reaching the summit of Everest in 2009 . Among the climbers who succeeded in the treacherous mission was student Mollie Hughes, 21, from Bristol, who has become the youngest woman ever to reach the summit. Her mother was told she was safe after beginning her descent. Her mother Jane Spreckley, from Torbay, Devon, is incredibly proud of her daughter's achievements. She said: ‘We're all beyond proud of Mollie. She's dedicated her life to today and has raised an incredible £2500 for her charity Action Aid. ‘I still haven't managed to speak to Molly but the group radioed to base camp to say they had made it safely. ‘We are extremely relieved to hear everything has gone well and she is fine - we can't wait to hear all about it.’ Weather conditions are clear enough to permit climbing to Everest's 29,035ft peak for only a short time in May. On May 10, 1996, eight people died on what is believed to be the worst day on Everest. The main reason was said to be that climbers who started their ascents late in the day were caught in a snow storm that swept the mountain in the afternoon.","German, Canadian and South Korean die from high altitude brain swelling .

"By . Jill Reilly . PUBLISHED: . 10:44 EST, 28 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:27 EST, 29 May 2012 . Sentenced: Christopher McGuire, was today imprisoned for the 'carefully thought out and skilfully executed' scheme . A codeine addict who replaced pills in a Nurofen Plus pack with his own schizophrenia medication to fund his habit was jailed today for 18 months. The contaminated packs ended up in the hands of unsuspecting members of the public and two men ended up taking them. Christopher McGuire cost the manufacturers £2.4million and saved himself just £7 by placing strips of an anti-psychotic drug in empty packets of the painkiller and swapping them for new packets at pharmacies. He was today imprisoned by a judge at Southwark Crown Court for the 'carefully thought out and skilfully executed' scheme, which created a 'good deal of public fear and anxiety'. Passing sentence, judge Alistair Mcreath told McGuire: 'Your acts caused very considerable financial harm, amounting to well over £2 million. 'The costs included recalling the product, destroying suspect stock, investigating the problem which you caused, returning new products to the market and handling the reputational damage caused by you. The court has heard how McGuire’s scheme involved asking for Nurofen Plus at a pharmacy counter and then attempting to pay for it with a card he knew would be declined. In doing this, he created sufficient distraction to discreetly swap the contaminated packet for the fresh one and walk away. His actions cost manufacturer Reckitt Benckiser £2.4 million when the painkiller was recalled. McGuire, who went to university at the age of 16, took 32 tablets of the drug each day to feed his secret addiction. But after losing his job he struggled to pay for it. Dangerous: The 31-year-old replaced empty packets with the Seroquel he was being prescribed for schizophrenia, and the contaminated packs ended up in the hands of unsuspecting members of the public . Instead, the 31-year-old replaced empty packets with the Seroquel he was being prescribed for schizophrenia, and two men, Peter Letham and Paul Connor, took the anti-psychotic drugs in error, believing them to be Nurofen Plus, and were left feeling unwell. Mr Letham and Mr Connor swallowed the wrong tablets after Mr Letham’s wife, Jacqueline, bought what she thought was a 32-pack of Nurofen Plus from a branch of Boots pharmacy in The Glades Shopping Centre in Bromley, south-east London, on August 21 last year. The next day Mr Letham, who was employed on a building site, took the packet to work. There he took three tablets and gave two to his colleague Mr Connor, who was suffering neck pain. Both men soon began to feel unwell, experiencing tiredness and dizziness. They later discovered the drug inside the packet was in fact Seroquel instead of Nurofen Plus. On July 24 and July 28 last year two other consumers realised the Nurofen Plus they had bought also contained Seroquel instead, but did not swallow any. Evidence: The court has heard how McGuire's scheme involved asking for Nurofen Plus at a pharmacy counter and then attempting to pay for it with a card he knew would be declined . The first incident occurred when a woman bought a 32-pack from a Boots pharmacy in London’s Victoria station and the second when a man bought a 32-pack in a branch of Boots in Beckenham High Street in south-east London. In a fourth incident, an assistant at a Beckenham pharmacy found Seroquel tablets inside a Nurofen Plus packet in the store. McGuire, of Edzell Drive in Glasgow, was tracked down to his landlady’s home in Swanley, Kent, on September 23 after the origins of the Seroquel were traced. He admitted his actions and was later charged with causing a public nuisance. Judge McCreath told McGuire his actions put the building site workers at significant risk and said others may have unwittingly taken the contaminated medication, leaving them similarly vulnerable. 'It needs little imagination to consider the many different circumstances in which that might have happened,' he said. 'What if they had been driving a car? Or operating machinery? In short, the risk of potential harm was very high.' He acknowledged McGuire was a man of good character and took steps to overcome his addiction. Telling McGuire he would serve half his sentence behind bars, minus the days already spent in custody, the judge added: 'What you did was potentially very dangerous, caused very substantial economic loss and was something for which you must take responsibility, not in the sense that you intended the consequences of it but because you chose to ignore them.' An overdose of Seroquel can cause coma, tachycardia (rapid heart rate) and hypertension (high blood pressure), she said at the opening of his sentencing on Friday. 'The consequences of the defendant’s actions were wide-ranging and spread beyond the actual medical harm suffered by Mr Letham and Mr Connor. (They) must have been to cause fear and alarm among the public as regards the safety of their health, and that can’t be minimised,' she added. Lawyer James Hasslacher, defending, said the figure of £2.4 million was an 'eye-popping' one for an offence that centred on McGuire saving himself £7. An extensive investigation was launched when the health scare broke out as 'it could not have been perceived that what was occurring was a young man in a very pathetic state of health trying to save himself £7', Mr Hasslacher said. 'He’s the most remorseful that one could be, to know the effect of his crime.' He described McGuire as a musically talented and intelligent man 'with so much potential', who had begun but not completed a string of degrees. McGuire had been 'reckless and stupid' but his mind had been addled at the time, Mr Hasslacher said. The defendant nodded quietly as the nature of his addiction was detailed in court this afternoon. He bowed his head as the judge spoke of the implications of his actions, before waving to a supporter in the public gallery, as he was led from the dock.","Christopher McGuire, 31, from Glasgow took 32 tablets of the drug each day to feed his secret addiction .

"PUBLISHED: . 07:54 EST, 8 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:07 EST, 8 August 2012 . Two drug smugglers who tried to hide cocaine worth £34million in boxes of imported pineapples have been jailed. Company director Terrance Smith, 58, and unemployed Frederick Colverson, 56, were jailed for a total of 45 years for their part in the biggest ever drugs haul discovered in Suffolk. The pair were arrested after police raided an industrial unit in Brandon last October. Convicted: Terrance Smith and Frederick Colverson have been jailed for a total of 45 years after their part in the biggest ever drugs haul discovered in Suffolk . Officers found 174kg of high-grade cocaine hidden in the bottom of the fruit crates, which had entered the UK through Felixstowe Docks. Smith's former lover, Anita Kennedy, tipped the police off about the operation by calling the Crimestoppers hotline following their acrimonious split,  Ipswich Crown Court heard. Smith, of Thetford, Norfolk, admitted on Tuesday to conspiring to supply class A drugs and was jailed for 20 years. Colverson, of Tower Hamlets, east London, denied the charge but was found guilty at Ipswich Crown Court last month and was jailed for 25 years. Sentencing the men, Judge John Devaux said Smith's ex-girlfriend had told police about an earlier drugs shipment in January last year. That was described by Smith and Colverson as ""the mother of all loads"" and they had expected to make a lot of money. Judge Devaux said that load had not been seized but he was satisfied it had taken place and had involved a significant amount of cocaine. Hidden: Police officers found £34m of cocaine stashed away at the bottom of boxes used for imported pineapples . The court also heard that in April 2010, Smith had set up 24/7 Import Export (Europe) Ltd and had rented industrial units in Brandon. He was the sole director and signatory on the company's bank account and between June and October that year, substantial amounts of money had been paid into the account. Colverson's fingerprints had also been found on documents in the industrial unit and incriminating documents had been found at his home. The pair's illegal activity finally came to an abrupt end when officers, who had been gathering information for months, swooped on the industrial unit on October 31 last year. A lorry carrying the massive stash of hidden drugs turned up at the unit and when the cargo was opened, officers heard an ""animated reaction"", said David Holborn for the prosecution. Record: The discovery of 174kg of high-grade cocaine is the largest ever drugs haul found in Suffolk . In defending Smith, Stephen Spence said he was ""a cog in the commercial chain"" and was not the organiser or financier of the ambitious money-spinning operation. Lindsay Cox, for Colverson, said her defendant was in poor health, lived in a terraced house and had a mortgage. But the pair were found guilty. At sentencing, Judge Devaux said Smith had played a . leading role in the drugs racket in this country and both men had . expected to make a lot of cash. Detective Inspector Benny Benford, of Suffolk Police, said after yesterday's hearing: 'The sentencing at court today emphasises the seriousness of Smith and Colverson's crime and sends out a strong message to those who maybe following the same criminal path.' He added that the discovery of the haul would have a ""significant impact"" in disrupting the drugs trade in England.","Terence Smith, 58, and Frederick Colverson, 56, tried to smuggle 174kg of high-grade cocaine into country .

Thieves have stripped lead from the roof of the church where the Bronte sisters are buried, causing thousands of pounds of damage to the historic building. The Rev Peter Mayo-Smith, has told of his 'great sadness' and claims that they may now even have to think about different material for the roof to prevent further vandalism. He also said that the raids on St Michael and All Angels Parish Church, where the Bronte sisters' father was once the reverend, may also have contributed the problems of a leaking roof which is causing religious paintings inside to 'literally start to disappear.' Stealing history: St Michael and All Angels Parish Church, in Haworth, West Yorkshire where thieves have stripped lead from the roof . A £1.25 million scheme is about to start to restore the 1879 fabric of the West Yorkshire  churchbut its targeting may force English Heritage to replace the North and South roofs with something other than lead to deter the thieves. Mr Mayo-Smith said: 'My response is one of great sadness because of the lack of respect it shows not just for churches but historic buildings in general. 'Other buildings in Howarth have also been attacked for lead including the local school and community centre. Distressed: The Rev Peter Mayo-Smith, has told of his 'great sadness' and claims that they may now even have to think about different material for the roof to prevent further vandalism . 'We have suffered at least three metal thefts in 18 months. They have stripped lead from the North and South roof and over the vestry. 'As a result we have had quite significant amounts of water come into the building. 'The damage runs to tens of thousands of pounds for the roof alone whereas the scrap value will be in tens of pounds. He said the main church roof was very long and it would have been been very heavy for the thieves to carry out in one job. He also told how the church had reached its insurance limit. 'For a large amount of effort for . very little reward they have caused so much damage to our infrastructure . and the other damage is hard to put a figure on.' Rain had been seeping into the building anyway because the roof was reaching the end of its life. However, . three raids by metal thieves on the North and South roofs may have . contributed to the water damage inside the church, he feared. Burial place: A painting of the Bronte sisters - left to right, Anne, Emily and Charlotte. At the church a floor plaque marks the graves of Charlotte and Emily . He said: 'The plaster is starting to fizz and you can see the damp and stains in the plaster work.' It was also damaging Italian style paintings depicting Biblical stories which were put up on the walls. He said: 'They are beautiful paintings but they are literally starting to disappear.' The church is to close on July 8 for 15 weeks for the first stage of a £1.25 million scheme backed by English Heritage to completely restore the building, including the religious paintings. It was in the hands of English Heritage and the architects whether lead was used for the roof or another material less attractive to thieves. He said: 'It would be a great pity if it was not lead because it is traditional and we are in a heritage site. 'But metal theft has become endemic and reached the stage where it is damaging the whole country.' The church's modern fame is chiefly due to its connections with the Brontë sisters and the link is what attracts thousands of visitors each year. The Reverend Patrick Brontë, father of the authors, was the incumbent from 1820 to 1861. He died in 1861 aged 84, having outlived his entire family and having served the Parish for 41 years. Members of the family, including Emily and Charlotte, are buried in the family vault adjacent to the present south-east chapel. There was a national outcry from Bronte enthusiasts in 1879 when it was decided to take down the old church building and build a new one. However, the building was unsafe and unsanitary as water from that graveyard was seeping in through the floor, so the scheme went ahead. However, the church remains as place of pilgrimage for visitors from all over the world. Leaflets in the church have been translated into Japanese, Chinese and Korean. A floor plaque marks the early graves of Charlotte and Emily.","Plundered thousands of pounds of lead from the roof of Haworth Parish Church in West Yorkshire .

"At £525,000, the garage is more than three times the average house price in Britain . By . Becky Barrow, Business Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 10:10 EST, 1 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:28 EST, 1 May 2012 . If your home is in Hartlepool, Newport, Sunderland or Newcastle upon Tyne, you should probably look away now. While house prices are plunging around Britain, particularly in these cities, there is one gold-plated corner of the capital where a garage is on the market for more than £500,000. Hidden in a tiny back street close to Harrods, the double garage does not look special from the outside. The garage on the little-known Rysbrack Street is painted black, but not that recently, and the brown brickwork around the garage has been blackened by dirt. Expensive: This garage, in Rysbrack Street, Knightsbridge, is on the market for £525,000 . But it has just been put on the market with the highest price tag ever charged for a garage by the estate agency WA Ellis, which was founded in 1868. At a record price of £525,000, the buyer could buy three of Britain’s ‘average’ homes, which currently cost £160,000 each, for the same price, and still have £45,000 left over in change. It is possible to swing a cat in the garage, but only just - it measures 6.4 metres wide and just 4.75 metres deep. Robert Lewis, an associate at W A Ellis, insists the garage is ‘exceptionally valuable’ because it is ‘very rare’ for a freehold garage in Knightsbridge to come up for sale. He said: ‘We anticipate interest from those already living within a two or three minute walk of the garage. 'For example, the large houses on Walton Place where there is no off-street parking.’ The garage was put up for sale a week after a  flat-roofed brick shed, in Highgate village, north London, went on the market for £259,950. Price tag: The shed, which went on sale in Highgate village,London, last week for £259,950 . Exclusive: One Hyde Park, in Knightsbridge, is the most expensive address in London . Ironically, news of the garage’s record asking price emerged on the day that official figures reveals house prices continue to drop sharply around the country. Overall, house prices have dropped by 0.6 per cent over the last year to an average price of £160,372, but the regional picture is far more worrying for many hard-working homeowners. For those who bought in 2007 - the year that house prices peaked in many parts of Britain but the credit crunch began - the figures, from the Land Registry, are particularly gloomy. In Hartlepool, the price of the average home has dropped by nearly a third since homes in the city peaked at an average of £110,743 in October 2007. Today the same home is worth £75,786, which means a homeowner has seen around £35,000 wiped off the value of their home since that date. Shopping mecca: The iconic Harrods store is located near the garage in Rysbrack Street . Others have also been hit hard. Over the last year, for example, prices have dropped by eight per cent in Newport, by 8.9 per cent in Sunderland and by 6.4 per cent in Newcastle upon Tyne. Meanwhile, they have reached an all-time peak in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, which includes the Rysbrack Street garage. The average price in the exclusive borough is close to £1million, having shot up by nearly 11 per cent over the last year. Knightsbridge is located in London's Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. In the past four and a half years, average property prices in the borough have risen from £827,238 to £983,842. One of the most exclusive properties in Knightsbridge, and indeed, London, is One Hyde Park, in which one flat was sold for an incredible £136 million in April 2011. The high rise building comprises 33 penthouses registered with a combined value of £727m. Between October 2011 and December 2011, 553 properties were sold in Kensington and Chelsea . In October 2007 - the month that property prices peaked in Hartlepool - the average price in Kensington and Chelsea was £827,238. Today it is £983,842. This is a rise of just over £150,000, an increase which the vast majority of homeowners in Britain can only dream their home will ever be worth. Peter Rollings, chief executive of the estate agency Marsh & Parsons, said prime parts of London are very attractive to foreign buyers wanting a safe haven for their cash. He said: ‘Central London’s bricks and mortar has long been the first port of call for investors - whether from the UK or abroad - looking to guard their wealth against economic uncertainty. ‘This will perpetuate demand for the limited stock of quality property in prime London, driving a larger wedge between London’s market and the rest of the country.’ The consultancy Capital Economics predicts average house prices in Britain will be around five per cent lower by the end of the year than they were in January.","At £525,000, the garage is more than three times the average house price in Britain ."
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 04:15 EST, 8 July 2011 . Failed . Nigerian asylum seeker Anthony Harrison, 32, used bizarre rituals to trap children into sex slavery . A council caretaker who smuggled two teenage girls into Britain and forced them to . work as prostitutes after they were put under a voodoo curse was jailed for 20 years. Failed . Nigerian asylum seeker Anthony Harrison, 32, also became the first person . to be convicted of trafficking the victims out of the UK in a groundbreaking . case. A jury at . Woolwich Crown Court unanimously convicted Harrison of a string of trafficking . charges but cleared him of two charges of rape. The girls involved, aged 14 and 16, from Edo in Nigeria, are believed to be the first 'Juju' voodoo rites victims to give evidence in a European court. The two . teenagers - who cannot be identified for legal reasons - underwent a series of perverse ceremonies which saw one of them . stripped naked, cut all over her body with razors and locked in a coffin for . hours. Another . ceremony saw her forced to drink blood while yet another involved eating a . chicken's heart. The Juju . rituals were intended to ensure the victims were 'bound' to a medicine man and . would never reveal the truth about their harrowing ordeals. Until now, those who have undergone such rituals have refused to speak out of fear that a curse would kill them. Harrison, . of Albert Square, Stratford, east London, worked for Newham council under the name Charles Pepple. Passing sentence, Judge Philip Shorrock said: 'The . trafficking of young girls from rural villages in Nigeria so they can be . compelled to work as prostitutes is a vile business. A 'black magic' wound inflicted on one of the unnamed victims smuggled into Britain by Anthony Harrison . 'When they . are as young as these girls and their innocence and credulity is exploited by . subjecting them to Juju ceremonies to terrify them into obedience and silence, . it is a trade that is viler still.' Prosecutor . Riel Karmy-Jones added: 'It is the first time the crown have been . able to persuade victims of this type of trafficking to give evidence in court. 'It is the . first time there's been a prosecution for trafficking out of the UK.' Harrison . led a double life as a 'key player' in a people trafficking gang which used . bizarre rituals to trap the children into sex slavery. He arrived in the UK in April 2003, claiming to be Liberian, but evidence . suggested he was actually from Nigeria. Although . his asylum application and subsequent appeals were refused, he was granted . indefinite leave to remain under the Home Office 'Legacy' programme. In 2009, . Harrison oversaw the smuggling of the girls  while he . worked for Newham council. Harrison . then shipped them on to Spain and Greece to work in the sex industry. Harrison 'controlled' his young victims using Juju witchcraft. Seen here is another injury sustained by one of the teenagers . When the . trial started, Judge Shorrock warned jurors that they would hear . evidence of terrifying voodoo rituals and gave them the chance to absent . themselves from the trial. The case . evokes memories of the five-year-old west African boy, later identified simply . as Adam, found washed up next to the Globe Theatre in 2001 after he was . smuggled into Britain. He had . been drugged with a 'black-magic' potion and sacrificed in a Juju ritual . killing before being thrown into the Thames. Jurors . heard how the two girls were sold by their families in Nigeria to people . traffickers. After . being subjected to Juju rituals in Africa, they were given 'scripts' to tell UK . immigration staff that they were claiming asylum, having been forced to flee . their country because they were accused of being lesbians. Juju . is a form of witchcraft thought to have originated  in West Africa . which centres  on the belief that objects can  be endowed with magical . powers. It is widespread in . Nigeria, where such objects are made into charms believed to have the . power to protect people or influence events. Many . of the practices of Juju are unknown as they are  conducted in secret, . but are generally characterised by elaborate rituals, often involving . animals. It is thought the word Juju means ‘fetish’ in Hausa, a language of northern Nigeria. Juju . travelled to the Americas from west Africa with the influx of slaves, . and still survives in some communities that retain strong ties with . their traditions. In more recent times, migrant workers from the region brought Juju to Britain and other parts of Europe. Once in . the UK, both girls were placed in care before they absconded in order to contact . their handler, Harrison. Both girls . were from a part of Nigeria where Juju magic or medicine 'exists side by . side and in conjunction with other religions such as Christianity.' Ms Karmy-Jones told jurors 'It is what many of us would immediately jump to . call black magic, or a kind of voodoo, but we would probably be incorrect in . that simplification,' she said. 'I am not . going to give you any huge detail, other than to say that Juju is amongst those . who believe in it considered to be very strong magic and is greatly feared. 'Both . girls were subjected to ceremonies involving this magic, although each appears . to have been quite different, and it has taken a long time - two years of . painstaking work - for the police involved in the investigation to build up . sufficient trust for these two girls to talk more openly about what happened to . them.' Jurors heard both girls feared they would die if they exposed their . captors to UK authorities. In a taped . interview with the 16-year-old who arrived in Britain on May 30, 2009, a female . officer is heard to ask: 'Do you still think that you're going to die from . talking to the police?' She replied: 'That's what they told me but I don't . know. 'At that . time, I believed it - even till now - because people are scared of it and they . said it kill people. 'I always believed that if I talked to the police I . will die - it was in my head. 'It's beginning to change because the first . time I talk to the police I was waiting, I thought I was gonna die, but I was . still waiting. Until now I haven't died.' The court heard the girl had been sold . to the trafficking gang by her uncle, who had also sexually abused her. After . collecting the girl, Harrison made the girl sleep outside at his east London . flat. She was . finally picked up by immigration officials in Madrid on June 20. Later a . 14-year-old girl was brought to the UK and forced to work as a prostitute out . of a spare room at Harrison's home before he attempted to pack her off to . Greece. The . teenager was intercepted at Luton airport. Giving . evidence, Harrison denied he had been involved in a sophisticated plot to . smuggle the girls through the UK to other European destinations. He claimed . he had been duped by a friend who told him both girls were relatives in need of . help, before they flew to Spain and Greece, respectively, of their own . volition. He told . the jury: 'When I was arrested the police told me I had been charged with trafficking. 'I was . shocked. I did not . know anything about any trafficking.' From August 2004 until his arrest at the . end of last year, he worked as a caretaker at Newham Council. Ms . Karmy-Jones added that it was impossible to be sure of his real age or name . because he had used at least seven different aliases at various times. Harrsion was found guilty of two counts . of conspiracy to traffic people into the UK for sexual exploitation, two of . conspiracy to traffic out of the UK for sexual exploitation, two counts of . false imprisonment and four of conspiracy to facilitate breaches of immigration . law. He also . admitted five counts of fraud by using false names to obtain employment, credit . cards and telephones at the outset of the trial. Welcoming the conviction, DC Andy Desmond of the Metropolitan Police's Human Exploitation and . Organised Crime Command said: 'I would like to pay tribute to the two victims . who showed tremendous courage by talking to the police and agreeing to testify . against their captor. 'These . young women suffered the most terrifying and degrading ordeal - leaving them . emotionally, psychologically and physically traumatised.

Lee Davison, 28, and Jessica Hopkinson, 18, are accused of injuring Krystal Davison at their home in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, and both sobbed throughout the short hearing today. Krystal was taken to Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield last Thursday evening and police were called in after reports of a baby being brought in with serious injuries. Tragic: Seven-week-old Krystal Davison is alleged to have been killed by her parents . She died in the early hours of the next morning. Today the pair spoke only to confirm their names, addresses and dates of birth at Pontefract Magistrates Court. Accused: Jessica Hopkinson, 18, pictured, and Lee Davison, 28, are charged with the murder of baby Krystal . Flanked by three security officers Davison, with short brown hair, jeans and a grey sweater crossed with thin blue lines, stood in front of Hopkinson, dressed in a bright pink top with black hair hanging down to her shoulders. The pair were visibly upset during the short hearing, her wiping her eyes with a white tissue and him crying with his head on his arms, but they did not acknowledge each other in the dock. They were both told that their case is to be sent to Leeds Crown Court on Wednesday. No bail application was made. The public gallery held around eight people, consisting of police and friends of the defendants. It is understood the couple moved to their rented three-bedroom home in Pontefract in February. A neighbour said the family had rushed to hospital on Thursday and police had been stood outside their semi-detached house ever since. Keith Coverdale said he had seen little of the couple since they arrived in the street - and even less of their child. On guard: Two police officers outside the house of Lee Davison and Jessica Pontefract who are accused of killing their young baby Krystal . Murder investigation: The seven-week-old baby girl eventually died at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield after an ambulance brought her in with serious injuries . Mr Coverdale, 28, said: 'The only clue I had that there was a young child in the house was the babygrows I would see hanging on their washing line. 'The only conversation I have had with them was on Tuesday night, when I took my dogs out for a walk,' he said. 'They were returning home with a baby in a pushchair and warned me to keep the dogs away from their gate.' Paul Rothwell, 67, the owner of the property, said he understood the couple moved in before they had the baby. He said the house is managed by a letting agency. A spokesman for Wakefield Council confirmed the family was known to social services. He added: 'It's obviously a really sad event but I cannot comment further in view of the police investigation.'","Lee Davison, 28, and Jessica Hopkinson, .

An employee of the company was subsequently contacted and identified . him.

Controversial: Considered a member of Gaddafi's inner circle until his defection, Mr Ghanem insisted that Libya bore no responsibility for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland . He also repudiated Libyan responsibility in the 1984 shooting of WPC Yvonne Fletcher during a protest in front of his country's embassy - an incident that led to the severing of British-Libyan relations. Mr Ghanem's efforts were supported by Saif al-Islam, the Gaddafi son associated with the reform wing. At the same time, he was viewed with suspicion by the old guard opposed to change - and their opposition to him led to his ousting as prime minister and subsequent appointment as head of the state oil company and de-facto oil minister. He was reinstated in those positions in 2009 just weeks after his resignation, a move reflecting the power struggle between reformists and nationalists in his oil-rich North African nation. Mr Ghanem continued to live in Vienna after Gaddafi was ousted and later killed last year in the Nato-backed rebel campaign.","Police say no .

Workers on the construction site where a baby boy was killed by an falling lampost were 'under pressure' to get the job done quickly, an inquest heard today. A steel plate supporting the lamp post was inadvertently severed during the excavation works being carried out in Chiswick, west London. Five days later, the lamp post toppled over and struck Tommy Hollis as he slept in his pushchair, causing devastating head injuries. He died in hospital 48 hours later, on the eve of his first birthday. Tragedy: Tommy Hollis died after being hit by a falling lamppost as he slept in his pram in Chiswick, west London, an inquest heard . Engineer Kelvin Elmore – a father himself . – told the hearing yesterday he wished he could ‘take the child’s place’ after learning of . his role in the death. Amin Sinani, a senior consultant with Aecom which designing the road re-widening scheme near said he had an email from the council stressing the importance of the work being done promptly. West London Coroner's Court was told that the council's head of transport in the London Borough of Hounslow expressed 'the growing concern, with this being a civic site and the election approaching'. The email continued that the council was 'very relieved' that Virgin Media was on site, as its underground cables needed to be moved as part of the scheme. Probe: Workmen inspect the lamppost on the day it fell. Civil Engineer Kelvin Elmore, who cut the post, said he wished he had died instead of Tommy . Asked by Owain Thomas, counsel for Tommy's parents Chris and Kate Hollis, if he was 'under pressure to complete this project quickly', . Mr Sinani replied: 'The site had been excavated for a long time. In that sense, yes, there was some sort of pressure to deliver the work on time.' Asked if the local authority was expecting him to 'exert pressure on Virgin Media to get on with it', Mr Sinani replied: 'Yes'. At the time engineer Kelvin Elmore cut through the steel plate holding the lamp post up, wrongly believing it to be part of an old tram line, a full excavation of the site was being carried out in a bid to avoid any further delays, the inquest heard. The trench ran on either side of the lamp post. Happy family: Tommy laughs for a photo shoot with his mother, Kate, and . father, Chris. He died after a lamppost fell on his head . A police officer removes the pram from the scene: Anna Martin said she was wheeling the sleeping toddler past roadworks when she heard a 'hollow' noise followed by a 'terrible scream' Mr Elmore, who was working for . construction firm McNicholas, contracted by Virgin Media to move their . cables, was trying to get the steel plate out of the way, believing it . to be an obstruction to the works. He was not able to remove it, . however. He is still employed by the firm, although an internal investigation found him guilty of gross misconduct. When . asked if there was any consideration given to nearby structures, . including the lamp post, when the decision was made to dig the trench, . Mr Sinani replied: 'No'. The . lamp post had been due to be removed from outside Chiswick Town Hall as . part of the works and moved to the other side of the road, the inquest . jury heard. Helping others: Mr and Mrs Hollis had another son, Jack, in September. They have set up a charity in Tommy's name to 'give loving care to children, in particular those without parents' Tragedy: Nanny Mary Gregory lies behind Tommy's buggy in Chiswick, West London . Tommy was . air-lifted to hospital after the accident on the morning of February 23, . 2010, which happened as his nanny was taking him to a coffee shop from . his parents' Chiswick home. Grandmother Mary Gregory was also hit in the lower back. Tommy's nanny Anna Martin told the inquest how she tried to resuscitate him after the lamppost fell. But his brain injuries were so serious he could not survive them. Mr and Mrs Hollis set up the Tommy Hollis Children's Fund after their baby's death. A . message on the charity's website reads: 'Tommy was a happy, smiley boy . who spread joy to everyone he met and we would like to do something in . his honour to spread the joy he gave us.' The couple, who live in Chiswick, had a second son, Jack, last September. Respect: A couple look at flowers laid at the scene. Nanny Miss Martin tried to revive the little boy with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation but he never regained consciousness . The . inquest has heard that the way the lamp post was secured was unusual, . with Mr Elmore adding that he had never seen such an arrangement in his . 17-year career. Mr Sinani also said he had not come across the set-up . before. A lamp post usually runs straight into the ground, or is secured on a concrete plinth, the inquest heard. The . bottom of the lamp post concerned had instead been cut off, and a steel . plate and concrete structure connected to it in a 'dog-leg' arrangement. Mr Sinani said . the decision to excavate the trench surrounding the lamp post did not . lie with him as his role was to act as a liaison between his client, the . council, and McNicholas, on behalf of Virgin Media, and to report on . the work being done. He had, however, expressed a preference for the full excavation so as to avoid a delay, he said. Mr . Sinani, who has worked in project management for Aecom for five years, . added that he had not seen a risk assessment of the site before the . digging of the trench that led to the lamp post foundation being . damaged.

French president Francois Hollande and girlfriend Valerie Trierweiler are set to marry 'in the near future', it was revealed today. Presidential aides have been urging France's first ever unmarried 'first couple' to wed quickly to avoid protocol problems on state visits to strict religious countries. Their status may be viewed as 'living in sin' by hardline states like Saudi Arabia or The Vatican, advisors have warned. To wed? Sources say France's new President Francois Hollande (left) is to make his companion Valerie Trierweiler (right) an honest woman and pop the question . And the pair have now decided to bow to pressure and tie the knot, France's Closer magazine reported. It said today: 'Members of Valerie's family have confided in us to reveal that they are planning a happy event, and in the not too distant future. 'For her to become Mrs Hollande would clarify her status in the eyes of the French people and the world, though the president's wife technically has no official status in our constitution.' Hollande, 57, and Trierweiler 47, met 15 years ago at a political rally and have been a couple for five years. The socialist president has four children with his previous 'live-in lover' Segolene Royal, who he left after she lost her bid for the presidency to Nicolas Sarkozy in the last election five years ago. Ms Trierweiler is said to be still so jealous of Ms Royal that she can not even bear to hear her name spoken. Complicated: The socialist president Hollande (left) has four children with his previous 'live-in lover' Segolene Royal (right) Until now both Mr Hollande and Ms Trierweiler have resisted calls to marry. The president said recently: 'I'm not ruling anything out, but this is an issue that concerns only Valerie and me. 'I am not presenting myself to the French people during this campaign as part of a couple, but as a political personality offering his ideas. 'We may marry through choice, but not for questions of protocol.' And Ms Trierweiler, a magazine journalist, has also told the French media they couple 'have no current plans to marry'. Takeover: Carla Bruni, wife of French President Nicolas Sarkozy, is the former First Lady . She said on her first day as the new First Lady today on May 6: 'I'm not so sure it will pose a diplomatic problem - though perhaps on a visit to the Pope. 'Frankly, it's not a subject that preoccupies me. This marriage issue is first and foremost a private matter for us.' But she is said to have changed her mind after being repeatedly asked about her status by American journalist at the recent G8 summit in Washington DC. She told French newspapers on her return: 'They kept asking if I was actually allowed to be there. What kind of era are we living in.' But Closer magazine added: 'Her main priority now is uniting her destiny with that of the president of France.' Nicolas Sarkozy faced the same problem five years ago after divorcing within months of taking office. Saudi Arabia - where unmarried couples are not permitted to be alone together - asked him to not to bring his new girlfriend Carla Bruni on a visit there in January 2008. Mr Sarkozy travelled alone and then married Bruni six weeks later - shortly before they shared a bedroom at Windsor Castle on a state visit to Britain. French constitutional expert Christian Delporte said: 'The fact that Francois Hollande and Ms Trierweiler are not married may not bother the French. Here, public and private life are separate. 'But it is not the same in some other countries, where their relationship may be viewed as sinful. 'If they don't marry then the same thing could happen to him as to Mr Sarkozy, where whatever his private feelings, he gets married out of his obligation to better perform his duties to France.' Le Figaro newspaper added: 'There are those close to Mr Hollande who are starting to advise him to do precisely this and do it within a few weeks, just to avoid any possible controversy on his trips overseas.'",Rumours Francois Hollande is looking to tie the knot .

Three men found dead in a BMW parked near Columbia University’s campus in Manhattan were known for robbing drug dealers and their murders may have been a retaliation, police said. Amaury Rodriguez, 31, Heriberto Suazo, 26, and Luis Catalan, 25, were shot in the skull execution-style by a gunman police believe was sitting inside the car during the shootings at the Morningside Heights neighbourhood. The men, discovered on Thursday evening near the Ivy League college, all had lengthy criminal records as they switched between robbing drug dealers or getting robbed by them. Killed: Amaury Rodriguez (left) and Heriberto Suazo (right) were two of three men shot dead in a BMW near Columbia University in what may have been a retaliation as they were known for robbing drug dealers . The $88,000 car was parked near the intersection of W. 122nd Street and Claremont Avenue, between the Union Theological Seminary and Riverside Church, DNAInfo reported. Authorities said they believe a gunman used a revolver to shoot the victims because no shell casings were found. Police said they believe the gunman first killed Catalan, sitting on the right, back seat, by shooting him in the left temple and side, the New York Post reported. Then driver Rodriguez died next followed by Suazo, who was sitting in the front passenger seat as they were both shot behind the ears. Bloody scene: Three men were found dead in a brand new BMW near Columbia University and the Manhattan School of Music . Sources said that the shooter was likely sitting behind the driver when he unloaded his rounds. Police believe the car had been parked for a maximum of an hour when it was discovered. The high-end vehicle had temporary registration stickers and appeared to be stolen, according to the New York Daily News. Catalan had been arrested at least 10 times for charges ranging from marijuana possession and driving without a license, the Daily News reported. Suazo was arrested late last year for having 12 pounds of marijuana and loaded guns. Rodriguez served two years in state prison for gun charges, according to the Daily News. No 911 calls were made to report any shootings and no students at the university claimed to hear any gunfire. 'This was a classic triple assassination,' said one source to the New York Post.’ 'The shooter had to be a cool customer to kill three men so close to him. He was quick and deadly.' Keeping vigilant: Two NYPD officers stand watch over the crime scene; all three victims were shot in the skull . One source told the Post that the attack, which happened during the day, was ‘a very bloody scene. 'Shooting three people in a car is extremely loud and the shooter may . have used a silencer,' said a police source. And 'he may have plugged . his ears.' Hours later, it was reported that 'blood was still dripping' from the car as it sat outside the university's Knox Hall. Police blocked off a wide area around the triple homicide after the bodies were found. ‘Both men in the front seat were wearing white T-shirts, both drenched in blood,’ said a police spokesman. Disturbing the peace: The three men were found on W. 122nd Street near Claremont Avenue, a generally quiet area within Morningside Heights . Addressing: NYPD Deputy Commissioner speaks to reporters about the bloody crime . The police were alerted around 6.30pm by a man walking by the scene who saw the two men in the front seat of the car appeared to be dead. Sources told the Post that they weren’t believed to have been students of the music school or at Columbia. NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne told reporters that authorities will go through surveillance video in hopes of putting the pieces together. Students in the area were badly shaken by the incident. The area, which is full of students from several of the schools and universities around, is generally considered a very safe area of Manhattan.","Police identified the three dead as Amaury Rodriguez, 31, Heriberto Suazo, 26, and Luis Catalan, 25, inside the dark grey BMW .

"By . David Gerges . PUBLISHED: . 05:06 EST, 4 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:46 EST, 4 May 2012 . Maxwell Stuart Alvey has admitted to profiting from his car mileage scam . A bogus car dealer made thousands of pounds by wiping the mileage off cars before selling them on to unassuming drivers. Maxwell Stuart Alvey, from Arnold, Nottinghamshire, profited in excess of £100,000 in just 10 months after buying a fleet of vans at auction then tampering with their mileage. People who bought the vans complained to Trading Standards after noticing there was an unusual amount of wear and tear for their mileage. In one case he reduced the mileage of a Mercedes Sprinter by more than 275,000miles from 364,370 to just 89,000. When cross-referenced with auction house records with AutoTrader records it was discovered he had taken more than 200,000 miles off another Mercedes Sprinter van before selling it to a plumber in Derby. Pegasus Plumbing Services forked out £6,319 for the vehicle which Alvey had bought for £4,423 at auction just weeks earlier. Mark Denton, contracts manager for . Pegasus, bought the 55-registration . Mercedes from Alvey who claimed it had clocked a mere 76,000 miles when in fact it had done 276,000. Mr Denton said: 'I was looking for a . larger van and when I saw the Mercedes it looked ideal. It was five . years old when we bought it, so the 76,000 miles quoted in the advert . was reasonable for a commercial vehicle. 'The price was a little bit lower . than the dealer prices I’d seen for the same model but because I thought . I was buying privately I wasn’t suspicious. 'When I went to see the van it looked . in good condition and Mr Alvey seemed a genuine character. He told us . the vans he sold were all supplied by the same company. 'We had the van HPI-checked - which it passed - and went ahead and bought it.' Angus will be sentenced today at Nottingham crown court for the series of offences . After altering the milometer readings . and tidying the bodywork, Alvey typically advertised the vans at between . £1,000 and £2,000 more than he had paid for them at auction. Trading Standards officers sifted . through documents and sales records relating to 123 vehicles, 111 of . which had already been sold. The . remaining 12 vehicles found in Alvey’s possession were seized. Only . four of the 123 vehicles had not had their milometer readings altered. In . total, 22 of the vehicles had milometer readings reduced by 100,000 . miles or more, with two vans having more than 200,000 miles wiped off . their real mileage. Councillor Mick Murphy, Cabinet . member for community safety at Nottinghamshire County Council, said: 'The extent of the vehicle clocking in this case is absolutely shocking. 'Mr . Alvey not only ripped off unsuspecting buyers, he placed their safety . at risk by making them think they were driving a vehicle with much less . wear and tear.' Alvey, has admitted 10 counts of fraud and will be sentenced at Nottingham Crown Court today. His then-partner, Jane Louise Starbrook, was cleared of any involvement in the fraud at an earlier hearing. Following . sentencing, Trading Standards’ Proceeds of Crime team will begin . proceedings to recoup profits Alvey has made from the van scam.","Reduced a Mercedes van's reading from 364,370 miles to just 89,000 before selling it on .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 04:56 EST, 18 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:30 EST, 18 April 2012 . A meeting between Anders Breivik and an English anti-Islamic militant calling himself ‘Richard the Lionheart’ was outlined in court yesterday. Nine years before his killing spree left 77 dead, the Norwegian said he was sitting in a London cafe with members of an extremist group called Knights Templar, to plot ‘how to seize power in Western Europe’. As well as ‘Richard the Lionheart’, Breivik was also ‘ordained’ by the group and given the name of the 12th-century Norwegian king, Sigurd ‘the Crusader’. Defiant: Breivik, for a third day running, pumped his fist out in front of him as he took to the stand to answer questions . Under cross-examination on the third . day of his trial yesterday, the right-wing extremist initially refused . to discuss meetings in Liberia and London in April and May 2002 as he . joined a network of ‘like-minded’ militant anti-Muslim nationalists. But after repeated questioning by . prosecutor Inga Bejer Engh, who told him she was trying to shed doubt on . the network’s existence, he conceded he had travelled to Africa and . London ten years ago to help set up his Knights Templar (KT) movement. For the first time Breivik, 33, . appeared rattled as it emerged he left Oslo on April 17, 2002, to fly to . the Ivory Coast before entering Liberia, posing as an aid worker. Breivik said that once there he met an exiled Serbian ‘war hero’, but . refused to identify the man. Breivik became agitated and claimed . Norwegian police had not been clever enough to uncover the KT movement’s . members. He said: ‘Exactly what is it you’re getting at? Are you trying . to sow doubt over whether the KT network exists? It does.’ Fearless: Mass killer Anders Breivik, pictured with his lawyer Geir Lippestad, told the court if he had feared death he would never have undertaken his 'operation' Fantasist: Anders Breivik, seen with lawyer Geir Lippestad, was told by prosecutors that his Knights Templar organisation didn't exist as he imagined . Hard job, but somebody has to do it: The stress of defending mass killer Anders Breivik shows on his face as he talks to a member of his team in the Oslo court . The court heard that Breivik flew to . London in late April 2002 where he attended a founding session of the KT . movement but he refused to give exact details of his co-conspirators. As images of Breivik’s 1,800-page . manifesto were flashed on to screens, the court heard that he met three . other founding members of the Knights Templar during his London visit. At 23, he was the youngest member of the group. World watches: Journalists work at the pressroom as defendant Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik is led into court for the third day of his trial . There were two Englishmen – including . his ‘mentor’, Richard the Lionheart – and a French nationalist at the . founding meeting. Breivik told the court: ‘It is not in my interest here . to discuss what went on. What I will say is that Richard was responsible for calling the meeting.’ In his manifesto, Breivik said: ‘It was basically a long-term plan on how to seize power in Western Europe.’ He told the court that the people he . had met in London had ‘great integrity’ and how his codename of . ‘Crusader’ was taken from Sigurd Magnusson, a 12th-century Viking king. Asked if he felt he had met some . ‘like-minded friends’ in London, he said: ‘I felt I was a foot soldier . associated with the others. Now I feel I have managed to do what I . wanted to do.’ Breivik also said he should face the death penalty – describing the 21 years he faces in prison as ‘pathetic’. When asked if he thought Norway should introduce the death penalty, he replied: ‘It would be the right thing.’ Watching intently: Hajrie, left, and Donika Selaci cousins of Lejla Selaci, who was gunned down by Norwegian Anders Behring Breivik, study his trial today from Vucitrn, Kosovo .

When a 38-stone unemployed woman was given an £8,000 gastric sleeve operation on the NHS, she knew she had been given the golden chance to turn her life around. But now Laura Ripley is now set to undergo a further £15,000 gastric bypass to help her lose weight and £12,000 worth cosmetic surgery. The 28-year-old complained that after slimming down to 20 stone because she had a gastric sleeve fitted, she lost her disability benefits because she was no longer fat enough to claim. Food for thought: Jobless Laura Ripley, 28, who will undergo a £15,000 gastric bypass at taxpayers' expense - three years after moaning that her disability benefit was being cut after her last operation . Left with 'just' £600 in handouts to live on each month, she moaned that she was unable to afford healthy food. Now, three years after she was first operated on, the junk food fan from Hastings, East Sussex, continues to eat chocolate and crisps every day. She is booked in for surgery so she can have a £15,000 taxpayer-funded gastric bypass. And . then she expects to receive a further £12,000 worth of cosmetic work to . improve the look of her body. She will undergo arm and thigh lifts and a . tummy tuck. Junk food fan: Laura continues to eat crisps and chocolate bars every day but says she will stop if she undergoes a new gastric band operation . Weight loss: Laura Ripley is now set to undergo a further £27,000 worth of surgery to help her lose weight . This will bring the final cost of her medical treatment to £35,000. This time she hopes her weight problem will finally be brought under control. Laura claims all the surgery is vital as she does not have the willpower to slim down by herself. She told Closer magazine: 'Some people might say I don’t deserve the second operation, but I do. It’s not my fault. I crave chocolate like every other woman. 'I always allow myself a few treats a day - usually two packets of Quavers and a chocolate bar at night.' Laura believes that, since the sleeve was fitted, her stomach has gradually stretched and this has meant she has been eating more. She says she lost weight in advance of the sleeve op, but does not have the strength of mind to do it again. 'I sometimes feel guilty about all the money that has been spent on me,' she said. 'But, after the bypass, I could be 16st by Christmas. Then I won’t eat crisps or chocolate.' After she had the original operation, . Laura complained that because she had lost so much weight she no longer . qualified for £340 per month in disability benefits - so couldn't . afford to eat healthily. At the time she said: 'I can't afford . to buy WeightWatchers crisps and cereal bars any more so I eat Tesco's . chocolate bars and packets of Space Invaders crisps, sometimes four of . each a day. 'People ask why I don't snack on an apple - they're cheap, but emotionally I don't always feel like an apple.' Laura's decision to have further medical treatment has enraged Tam Fry from the National Obesity Forum. He said: 'Laura would have been told what to eat after her gastric sleeve, but she has ignored advice and gone back to her old ways. 'The NHS came to her aid when it was necessary. But now she is scrounging off the system and could be denying surgery to someone with a life-threatening illness like cancer.' Laura, who is a vegetarian, claims her . typical daily diet would be Rice Krispies for breakfast, jacket potato . with beans for lunch and spaghetti with Quorn Bolognese for dinner. But she admits that, once a week, she has two slices of toast for breakfast and treats herself to a salad wrap. Laura says she feels guilty about living off the state.

A man accused of rounding up 200 Bosnian Muslims for slaughter in what is thought to be the bloodiest mass killing since World War Two has been found running a grocery store in Las Vegas. Dejan Radojkovic was arrested and deported to his native country to face charges of genocide for his part in the Srebrenica massacre in 1995 which saw the murder of  up to 8,000 Bosnian Muslims. Court documents show that Radojkovic and his family were granted refugee status and admitted to the United States in 1999 - four years after Srebrenica. Dejan Radojkovic arrives at McCarran Airport in Las Vegas, for the initial leg of his removal flight back to Sarajevo . He is said to have two children, daughter, Ranka Shaw, who now lives in Bosnia and son, Ranko Radojkovic, who lives in Las Vegas. Documents show that Radojkovic became a permanent U.S resident in January 2002 and used money from an insurance settlement to open the grocery, which sold food, tobacco, sundries and videos. It is understood that his wife died in a car crash in Las Vegas in September 2000 at 43 years of age. The business closed when Radojkovic was arrested in January 2009. He remained in U.S. custody for more than three years. Officials have confirmed that he arrived in Sarajevo, Bosnia- Herzegovina, yesterday, after boarding an overnight commercial airline flight from Las Vegas accompanied by federal agents. His lawyer in Las Vegas, Don Chairez, claimed that no evidence links his 61-year-old client with the execution of Muslim boys and men in July 1995. 'He is not a war criminal,' said Chairez . 'There is no evidence that Mr. Radojkovic ever killed anybody.' Prosecutors say that the father-of-two commanded a special police brigade that rounded up hundreds of Muslims in the Konjevic Polje region for execution. Radojkovic will face genocide charges. He lived in the United States for 12 years where he ran his own business . But his lawyer refutes this, claiming that Radojkovic didn't know the men would be killed when he turned the men over to Bosnian Serb forces. Radojkovic was arrested in 2009 for failing to disclose his wartime history when he entered the U.S and documents identify him simply as an ethnic Serbian refugee. An immigration judge in late 2009 ordered him deported on multiple grounds, finding that he ordered or participated in 'extrajudicial killing'. U.S. and Bosnian authorities confirmed that Radojkovic was handed over to police yesterday at the Sarajevo airport for prosecution based on evidence collected by investigators from the ICE Human Rights Violators and War Crimes Center, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia at The Hague and prosecutors from Bosnia-Herzegovina. Nicole Navas, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman in Washington confirmed that Radojkovic was wanted on genocide charges. Announcing the Bosnian national's deportation Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton said: 'For the families who lost loved ones at Srebrenica, justice has been a long time coming. 'But they can take consolation in the fact that those responsible for this tragedy are now being held accountable.' Morton added: '(America) does not serve as a haven for human rights violators and others who have committed heinous acts.' Authorities preparing for the trial of another former Bosnian Serb military leader, Ratko Mladic, on war crimes charges at The Hague, Netherlands, said this month the remains of almost 6,000 people had been exhumed from mass graves in the Srebrenica area. Mladic is standing trial before the military war tribunal on wider charges stemming from atrocities during a process dubbed 'ethnic cleansing.' Mejra Dzogaz searches for the names of her killed relatives in a memorial plaque. Her husband, three sons and a grandson were killed during the Srebrenica massacre in 1995 by a Serbian army unit commanded by Mladic . Bosnia's 1992-95 war following the breakup of the former Soviet republic of Yugoslavia left more than 100,000 dead. Chairez said: 'The government merely alleges that as an individual who was part of a group that accepted the surrender of these enemy soldiers, it is presumed that Radojkovic should have known that the Bosnian-Serbian military forces were likely to kill them. 'There is no evidence and there is no allegation that Radojkovic shot and killed a single prisoner.' The appeals court in February denied Chairez's appeal, clearing the way for Radojkovic's deportation.","Dejan Radojkovic built a life in America after being granted refugee status in 1999 .

A Parish councillor has been suspended in a quiet picturesque village for swearing and threatening a man during a furious row over a tombola draw. Tempers boiled over in the historic and beautiful village of Long Melford, Suffolk, when councillor Richard Michette, 66, objected to criticism of his wife's handling of the draw. Richard Roper, a member of the public, had made a statement at a public meeting criticising Mrs Michette for her part organising Long Melford's street fair. Drama: Respected councillor Richard Michette (left, with wife Carole), called Richard Roper (right) a 'little s***' before threatening to punch him during the tombola row . Picturesque: The furious row has caused unprecedented drama in the beautiful historic village of Long Melford . And faced with the verbal assault on his wife's ability to run the historic fair, Mr Michette raged during the council meeting: 'One more word from you and I will thump you.' In dramatic scenes at odds with the usual sedate pace of village council meetings, Mr Michette also branded Mr Roper a 'little s***', before threatening legal action against him. The unprecedented ugly scenes saw Mr Michette suspended from the 120-year-old Long Melford Parish Council for swearing at and threatening Mr Roper. The spat began when prizes donated to the Long Melford raffle by village businesses were allegedly offered at the tombola instead. Mr Roper also used his chance to make a statement at the meeting to vent his anger at supposed errors with the raffle and tombola prizes. Mrs Michette's husband Richard, a local optician who has lived in the village for 30 years and a parish councillor for 25 years, lost his cool over what he regarded as unfounded criticism. Quiet: The furious exchange in Long Melford caused drama at the normally sedate public meeting for the Parish Council . He stood up and described Mr Roper as 'a little s***', before adding: 'Shut your mouth.... One more word from you and I will thump you now.' Mr Michette, who is also trustee and . secretary of The Friends of Long Melford Church, also warned Mr Roper: . 'You will be hearing from my solicitor'. The . outburst led to him being suspended for six weeks form his role as a . councillor by the Babergh District Council and Mid Suffolk Council joint . standards committee. Cllr Michette has sat on the authority for 30 years while his wife joined last May. Last night Mr Michette said: 'I lost my temper and - under severe provocation - called him a 'little s**t'. 'Following the meeting I wrote to him and apologised and he accepted my apology.' Mrs . Michette said her husband was simply doing what anyone would have done . in the circumstances if their partner was criticised in public. She said: 'It's been very stressful. We are not going to stand down. 'We have been voted in by lots of people and I am a bit vocal and stand up for things - sometimes that goes against you.' Mr Michette's outburst was so shocking that another member of the public at the meeting complained to Babergh District Council about the 66-year-old's behaviour. A hearing was held in February following an investigation. Criticism: Richard Roper, a member of the public, had made a statement attacking Carole Michette for her role in organising the village fair in Long Melford . Long-standing: Mr Michette, who has stood on the local authority for 30 years, has been suspended for six weeks following the outburst . The sub-committee concluded that Mr Michette had failed to treat Mr Roper with respect, contrary to the code of conduct and had brought the office of councillor and the parish council into disrepute. The members found his conduct was 'threatening, unreasonable and demeaning' to Mr Roper and was a clear, serious breach. Long Melford attracts thousands of visitors and holidaymakers from all over the UK as well as worldwide every year.

Tory MP Charlie Elphicke said: . ‘Today’s vote is very disappointing news for hard-working families and . businesses who will be inconvenienced by this unnecessary and . irresponsible strike. ‘Ed Miliband must condemn this strike and get Labour’s biggest trade union paymaster round the negotiating table.’ Unite has warned the strike will lead . to 7,900 petrol stations closing, as the firms it balloted supply 90 per . cent of the total.

The looming protests serve as a . reminder of September 2000, when the petrol blockade brought the nation . to its knees.

A baby was baptised at birth because doctors gave her such a low chance of survival has made a full recovery. Mother Kellie Burville, 27, developed a rare condition during pregnancy that caused her body to attack her unborn baby. Doctors said there was a high risk that her daughter would be so severely brain damaged she wouldn't survive and she was given the option of having a termination. But Kellie, who was nearly full-term, decided to continue with her pregnancy. Proud parents: Kellie Burville and partner Callum Campbell with daughter Logan who is hitting all the normal milestones . Even after her baby was born, Kellie and partner Callum Campbell from south London were advised to get their daughter baptised because she wasn't expected to live longer than a few hours. However, although their daughter Logan was dangerously ill at birth, she stunned medics by making a rapid improvement and is now progressing well. Ms Burville said: 'I had gone through my whole pregnancy looking forward to having my first child. I was determined to go through with it. 'I'd carried her for nine months in my tummy and refused to give up hope.' At 36 weeks pregnant, Kellie was told her baby might be in the breech position, which could cause complications during birth. She was sent for a scan a week later to see if her baby could be turned. Kellie, a full-time mother, said: 'When he started scanning my stomach he went quiet. He went to the consultant but she had gone home for the day and he told us we needed to come back on Monday. 'I asked if something was wrong but he said he wasn't qualified to tell us. It was such a long, horrible weekend. We didn't know what was wrong.' Logan (pictured left at one day old) was baptised at birth as doctors feared she wouldn't survive. She is now four months old (right) The following Monday, the consultant delivered the devastating news the couple's baby had suffered a brain bleed and she would be severely brain damaged. They were told she was not expected to survive and the couple were offered a range of options, including a termination. Kellie said: 'Our whole world fell apart in that moment. I looked at Callum and burst into tears. 'I'd just had my baby shower a couple of days before. We already knew we were having a girl and had bought everything for her. We'd been so excited. 'The doctor explained that if she did survive, she wouldn't be able to walk or talk. She wouldn't be able to feed and wouldn't know who we were. 'Having a termination never crossed my mind though.' The scan showed Logan's head was twice the normal size because of the amount of fluid on her brain and a natural birth would be impossible. Tense: Callum and Kellie had thought of songs for their daughter's funeral before the birth . Kellie said: 'They had already told us they wouldn't do anything for her or give her any treatment after she was born. They weren't expecting her to live. 'Callum and I tried not to think about it but we picked some songs we wanted playing at her funeral. 'We were given a bereavement blanket to wrap her in and a moses basket.' A caesarean section was scheduled the week before Kellie's due date and Logan was born weighing 5lb 5oz. She said: 'It was amazing to hear her cry. Our little girl was alive. Her head was normal size and she started feeding straight away.' Tests revealed Logan had a platelet count of just five - dangerously low. A newborn baby should have a level between 150 and 450. Logan was given a blood transfusion to help boost her platelet levels. The couple were placed in a private room to spend what little time they had left with their daughter. Kellie said: 'A midwife asked if we wanted to see a chaplain to get her baptised. My tummy had already been blessed before the birth. 'It was such a happy time and for her to come and say that burst our bubble.' Logan was diagnosed with Neonatal Alloimmune Thrombocytopenia, which is where the mother's body treats her unborn baby as a harmful invader . An MRI scan the next day showed fluid had build up in the brain, pushing it against the skull and causing a brain bleed. Doctors were still baffled by what was behind it and initially put it down to an infection during pregnancy. However, at four-days-old Logan was diagnosed with the potentially fatal Neonatal Alloimmune Thrombocytopenia (or NAIT), where the mother's body treats her unborn baby as a harmful invader. The condition causes the mother to make antibodies that attack the baby's platelets. This can cause babies to bleed into their brain, stomach or spinal chord during pregnancy or shortly after birth. Babies can be at serious risk of brain damage or even death. It is so rare, the condition was only discovered after Kellie's sister typed Logan's symptoms into an online search engine and came across a charity called Nait Babies. She passed the information onto doctors and a simple blood test confirmed the diagnosis. Doctors were happy with Logan's platelet count and she was allowed home the same day. Four months on, Logan has confounded medical opinion and her parents believe she will live a normal life. Logan's consultant was planning to insert a shunt to help drain any fluid from her brain but Kellie has been told there is currently no need. Precious: Logan's consultant told Kellie her daughter was using other parts of her brain . Kellie said: 'She's doing everything you would expect of a healthy baby. She's hitting all her milestones. 'Her consultant said babies are very resilient. They can use other parts of their brain. She's my little miracle.' Logan's father, 23, said: 'I was scared but I didn't want to express how I felt because I had to be there for Kellie. I had to stay strong but inside I didn't know what would happen. 'Logan is doing really well. It's amazing to see her doing all the things the doctors said she wouldn't be able to do.' A spokesman for Chelsea and Westminster Hospital said: 'When Kellie Burville was 37 weeks pregnant, we carried out scans which showed that her unborn baby had a brain bleed. 'Our doctors discussed the implications of this with Kellie and her partner who were offered a range of choices including terminating the pregnancy because there was a more than 50% risk of serious handicap to her unborn child. 'Kellie and her partner were not advised to terminate her pregnancy, they were offered choices which included termination. 'We fully supported Kellie and her partner in their choice to continue with the pregnancy and we delivered their baby by Caesarean section and then provided treatment after Logan was born on our Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. 'We are delighted that Kellie and Logan are doing well and we wish them well for the future.'For more information, visit www.naitbabies.org .","Logan's parents refused to have a termination despite their daughter having a greater than 50% risk of severe handicap .

Philip Hammond paid tribute to the servicemen saying 'Their sacrifice will not be in vain and we will never forget them' He said: 'I send out my heartfelt condolences to the families and friends of Corporal Brent McCarthy and Lance Corporal Lee Davies, whose lives were cut tragically short by a cowardly act of aggression. 'Both servicemen were performing an invaluable role, training and mentoring Afghan police, helping to ensure that Afghanistan will never again be a place from which international terrorists can launch attacks on our society. 'Their sacrifice will not be in vain and we will never forget them.' Cpl McCarthy was born into a service family in Hanover, Germany, before returning to the Midlands, where he grew up in Telford, Shropshire. He joined the Royal Air Force in August 2008 and later joined the RAF Police. He was described by family and friends as 'a man of many talents and diverse interests' and was a keen football and hockey player and also played the drums.

In his personal life Lance Corporal Davies was a livewire who enjoyed nothing more than a night on the town. He was the living embodiment of the Army’s work hard, play hard ethos.' He added that he was a 'formidably talented team commander' and that the Welsh Guards 'have lost a man of inestimable promise'. This year 22 Nato troops have been killed by Afghan allies in so-called ‘green-on-blue’ incidents. Last year 35 servicemen were killed in such attacks.

A two-year-old boy was in intensive care today after being found so malnourished that he weighed less than half as much as a normal child his age. The toddler, whose heart had stopped, weighed between 8 and 10 pounds and had no hair or muscle tone when emergency responders arrived at his home in Moses Lake, Washington. His mother, who said she chose to consult a Chinese herbalist when it came to health matters for her son, was seen attempting to perform CPR when emergency workers arrived. Malnourished: The toddler weighed less than 10lb and had no hair or muscle tone when emergency responders arrived at his home in Moses Lake, Washington . He was airlifted to a Spokane hospital, where his parents, Richard and Michelle Staats, remained with him. In the police report, emergency workers noted that it was not likely that the boy would survive even once he arrived at the hospital. 'The child was treated for severe malnutrition and dehydration,' the search warrant for the family home stated. 'The child's condition was so severe that he was flown by MedStar to Spokane, Washington and was not expected to survive.' Cause for concern: The boy was on life support at Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center in Spokane . The boy had no hair or muscle tone, had a weak pulse, was bleeding from the rectum and had a core body temperature of 89F compared to normal body temperature of 98.6F. 'It was also obvious that the child could not even have sat up on his own for some time,' the warrant stated. The symptoms were consistent with long-term malnutrition. Mrs Staats, 32, told detectives she had spoken about the boy to a Chinese herbalist in San Francisco on the telephone, and also had consulted with a local naturopath. There are no known medical records for the boy, and police described him as 'skin and bones'. Kyle Foreman, a spokesman for the Grant County Sheriff's Office, said: 'There are a lot of questions investigators need to find answers for.' Emergency: The two-year-old, who lived in Moses Lake (pictured), weighed only a couple of pounds more than the average weight for a newborn baby in the U.S. Four other children who lived at the family home were in good condition, Mr Foreman said. They were taken into custody by child protective services. John Wiley, a spokesman for the state Department of Social and Health Services in Spokane, said child protection workers had no previous contact with the family. Mr Foreman could not speculate on why the other children were not ill. He added: 'There have been no arrests, and no one has yet been charged.' The scene: Emergency responders arrived at the home to find the boy's mother giving him CPR . Protection: Four other children who lived at the family home were taken into protective custody . 'The parents did have the opportunity to check on their child but that child and all the other children are in the custody of child protective services so they are safe,' a police officer told local NBC affiliate KHQ. According to a search warrant, someone at the home dialled 911 on May 9 to report that a child had stopped breathing. Mrs Staats, 32, was giving the child CPR when emergency responders arrived. The boy was taken first to a Moses Lake hospital, then airlifted 90 miles to Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center in Spokane. According to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a two-year-old boy in the U.S. usually weighs between 22lb and 34lb. The malnourished toddler weighed only a couple of pounds more than the average weight for a newborn baby in the U.S.- 7lb 5oz.

A gas fitter wept today as he was jailed for three years for the manslaughter of a millionaire’s daughter who died from carbon monoxide poisoning following his botched installation of a boiler. Andrew Hartley, 37, fitted the new boiler into Zoe Anderson’s Bath home less than two weeks before she was overcome by gas fumes. He was told by the judge it was 'simply the price he must pay'. Jailed: Andrew Hartley, 37, left, fitted the new boiler into Zoe Anderson’s, (pictured right), Bath home less than two weeks before she was overcome by gas fumes and was found dead in the shower . Judge Neil Ford QC said there were 'absolutely no malicious or hostile intentions in this case' but the loss to Miss Anderson’s family was 'profound'. A jury at Bristol Crown Court found Hartley guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence by a majority of 10 to two following a two-week trial last month. Hartley, of Radstock, Somerset, had already admitted a charge of breaching gas safety regulations under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 by failing to secure the boiler flue pipe with screws. The family man appeared in court today dressed in a purple shirt and tie and was supported by his wife and two friends. Father and daughter: Zoe Anderson, who died in December 2010, and her father the multi-millionaire media mogul Chris Anderson who now lives in America . As the judge read out the gas fitter’s sentence Hartley wiped tears from his eyes and his face was visibly reddened. Judge . Ford said: 'On the 16th December you installed a new gas boiler at Sion . Hill, a property owned by Chris Anderson and used from time to time by . his daughter Zoe Anderson. 'On 28th December Zoe was overcome by carbon monoxide in the shower room and tragically died. 'Zoe was a young and talented woman with a fruitful life ahead of her. 'When you left the site you believed the flue was correctly fitted, but the flue was not connected to the turret elbow. 'The quality of work fell below your normal high standards. Miss Anderson died within just 30 minutes . of being exposed to the carbon monoxide after fumes leaked from the . flue pipe connected to the boiler in the garage of the Victorian . townhouse . 'You knew the potential dangers of a . carbon monoxide leak and leaving the flue unconnected created a clearly . foreseeable risk to life and, as the jury found, amounted to criminal . negligence. 'You were qualified, your record of work in the field was long and good. You are a wholly respectable man. 'Your sense of guilt can properly be characterised as overwhelming. 'There . is no self pity in your approach to the tragedy, you are accurately . aware of the suffering that you have inflicted on others and that the . suffering of the Anderson family is the greatest of all. Chris Anderson's Bath home where his daughter Zoe was found dead in the shower by her boyfriend . 'There . is no prospect at all of you committing further offences, this is . simply the price that you must pay for an isolated but serious criminal . offence.' Judge Ford sentenced Hartley to three years in prison for manslaughter by gross negligence and one year, to run concurrently, for breaching gas safety regulations. Hartley’s wife sobbed from the public gallery as he was taken away to start his prison sentence. During the trial the court heard that Miss Anderson, 24, the daughter of magazine tycoon Chris Anderson, was found dead by her boyfriend in the shower room of her father’s home in Sion Hill - one of Bath’s most exclusive streets - on December 29 2010. Zoe (right) and her father Chris. A tribute page set up on Facebook described the last month of Miss Anderson's life as 'one of the happiest months of her life' as she prepared for an internship in New York . At first it was thought the neuroscience graduate had slipped and banged her head, but later it was found she had collapsed from carbon monoxide poisoning. The prosecution said Hartley did a 'rushed' and 'botch' job, failing to secure the flue pipe correctly. Miss Anderson died within just 30 minutes of being exposed to the carbon monoxide after fumes leaked from the flue pipe connected to the boiler in the garage of the Victorian townhouse. Hartley - who has been in the gas and plumbing industry for 20 years and had an unblemished career - was said by colleagues, acquaintances and friends to be reliable, professional and trustworthy. Michael Fitton QC, defending, said today: 'This is not a man who has lied to the police. This is not a man who has sought to escape what he did. 'He came to this court a man of good character, he came to this court respected as an employee and an employer. 'He stands here a family man and a businessman, whose family will suffer greatly in his absence. 'Your Lord has read powerful testimonies of my client as a friend, as a father, as a husband and as a good man. 'He stands here today knowing he will go to prison.' Hartley had previously told the jurors he admitted a charge of contravening gas safety regulations, which reflected his failure to secure the flue pipe with screws. However, he denied he was grossly negligent and said he felt 'awful' about not carrying out the installation properly. 'I didn’t complete it the way I should have done because I didn’t put the screws in,' Hartley said. He added that when he left Mr Anderson’s home the Worcester boiler was working properly and he had fully tested it. Miss Anderson's family were not in court today, but speaking following the verdict last month, her mother Lucy Evans, said her family had 'felt an intense pain and bewilderment' following her death. She added that she had found forgiving Hartley 'hard work', but said her family were now hoping to now rebuild their lives. Following her death Mr Anderson, the founder of the Future Publishing stable of magazines who now lives in America, described his daughter as 'beautiful' and 'larger-than-life'. A tribute page set up on Facebook described the last month of Miss Anderson's life as 'one of the happiest months of her life' as she prepared for an internship in New York. The page described Zoe as 'living big. She touched the lives of everyone she met with her laughter, curiosity and generosity'. Mr Anderson started Future Publishing in 1994 with a £10,000 loan in his parents' garage in Somerton, Somerset. He sold the company in 1994 for £52.7 million before buying it back four years later and selling it again in 2001. He then headed for America where, based in New York, he is the owner of TED, which hosts talks by globally renowned thinkers. Detective Inspector Neil Beament, who led the investigation, said: 'This is a tragic, tragic case. Andrew Hartley is a professional tradesman with all the relevant qualifications. 'His substandard work has led to the death of Zoe Anderson, a young woman with a very bright future. 'The verdict and sentence reflects the severity of his failings and sends a clear message to all tradesmen in relation to the duty of care they owe all their customers. 'The case also highlights the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning and I would urge all householders to consider the installation of appropriate devices. 'My thoughts are with Zoe's family at this very difficult time.' It is a legal requirement that anyone who carries out gas work must be registered on the Gas Safe Register. To be registered, gas engineers have to provide proof of their technical expertise, including qualifications and certificates of competence, which they are re-tested on every five years.

The war of words between Rupert Murdoch and Gordon Brown continued this morning as the media mogul renewed his attack on the former prime minister's 'state of mind'. In the opening minutes of the Leveson Inquiry, Mr Murdoch said Mr Brown ordered Lord Mandelson to make up lies about an alleged secret deal with David Cameron. The 81-year-old said that Lord Mandelson admitted in his autobiography that he 'did this under order from Mr Brown . knowing it to be false', adding: 'I think that reflects Mr Brown's state . of mind at the time.' Rupert Murdoch speaking on day two of the Leveson Inquiry . Mr Murdoch also rejected Mr Brown's claim that he . was wrong when he said the former prime minister 'declared war' on the . tycoon's media empire after the Sun switched support to the . Conservatives in 2010. Yesterday, Mr Brown issued a frank denial of the conversation, but Mr Murdoch said this morning: 'I said that very carefully yesterday, under oath, and I stand by every word of it.' Mr Brown yesterday accused Mr Murdoch of misleading the Leveson Inquiry following his comments on the disputed 'declare war' conversation. In extraordinary testimony at the inquiry which prompted a war of words between the two men, Mr Murdoch claimed Mr Brown phoned him in 2009 to demand to know what was going on when The Sun, his flagship newspaper, declared it was switching its backing from Labour to the Tories. He said that during the conversation, accounts of which have circulated for months at Westminster, it was clear that Mr Brown was not in a ‘balanced state of mind’. Back for day two: Rupert Murdoch with his wife Wendi and son Lachlan leave his Mayfair flat in west London this morning as they head back to the Leveson Inquiry to be quizzed about phone hacking . Battle: Gordon Brown and Rupert Murdoch were engaged in an incredible war of words last night with the former Prime Minister accused of making a 'threatening' phone call to the media mogul when The Sun dropped support for Labour in 2009 . Mr Murdoch said that when The Sun declared its support for Mr Cameron in September 2009 he had told Mr Brown: ‘I’m sorry to tell you Gordon, we will support a change of government when there is an election.’ He said Mr Brown responded: ‘Well, your company has declared war on the Government. We have no alternative but to declare war on your company.’ Mr Murdoch told the inquiry: ‘I said, “I’m sorry about that Gordon, thank you for calling”, and that was that. End of subject. I don’t think he was in a very balanced state of mind... I don’t know.’ Last night Mr Brown issued a tersely worded public statement, insisting: ‘I did not phone Mr Murdoch or meet him, or write to him about his decision. The only phone call I had with Mr Murdoch in the last year of my time in office was a phone call specifically about Afghanistan and his newspaper’s coverage of the war. Threatened: Rupert Murdoch said Gordon Brown was not 'in a balanced state of mind' when he phoned him as he gave evidence to the Leveson Inquiry yesterday . ‘This was in the second week of November after his newspaper, The Sun, printed a story in the second week of November about the death of a soldier and his mother’s complaints. ‘I hope Mr Murdoch will have the good grace to correct his account.’ His denial is exceptionally serious, as it alleges Mr Murdoch was not telling the truth at a judicial inquiry where witnesses swear on oath to do so. The feud between the two men, who were once so close that their wives held a ‘slumber party’ together at Chequers, the Prime Minister’s official residence, escalated in the dying days of the Labour Government. Mr Murdoch’s allies note that Labour figures close to Mr Brown have since led the pursuit of his empire over the phone-hacking scandal. Cosy relationship: Gordon Brown and his wife Sarah with Rupert Murdoch and his wife Wendi shortly after Mr Brown became Prime Minister in 2007 . Big smile: Rupert Murdoch is driven away with his wife Wendi after giving evidence to the Leveson Inquiry at the High Court in central London yesterday . Giving evidence to Lord Justice Leveson’s inquiry into the Press yesterday, Mr Murdoch, 81, used glowing terms to describe Mr Brown’s nemesis Tony Blair, saying he was ‘impressive’ and a personal friend who was god-father to his daughter Grace. He even revealed it was true he had joked to Mr Blair, when he was leader of the Opposition in the early 1990s: ‘If our flirtation is ever consummated, Tony, then I suspect we’ll end up making love like porcupines – very, very carefully.’ The News Corporation chairman and chief executive insisted he had never asked any politician for commercial favours, and resented the implication that his newspapers backed political parties depending on such factors. ‘If that had been the case we would have endorsed the Conservative Party in every election,’ he said. ‘But I didn’t. I was interested in issues. I want to put it to bed once and for all, that that is a complete myth... that I used the influence of The Sun or the supposed political power to get favourable treatment.’ In a moment of levity, Mr Murdoch caused laughter when describing the ‘pyjama party’ held by Mr Brown’s wife Sarah at Chequers which was attended by former Sun editor Rebekah Brooks and Mr Murdoch’s wife Wendi Deng. ‘I think there were just a bunch of women, mainly complaining about their husbands probably,’ he said. In his testimony, Mr Murdoch also attacked Mr Brown for his ‘outrageous’ suggestion that The Sun had hacked medical records to get the story of Mr Brown’s son Fraser being diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. The inquiry heard Mr Murdoch’s visits to Downing Street were always by the back door because prime ministers ‘don’t want me to be photographed going in the front’, adding: ‘It happens to be a shortcut to my apartment so it’s quite OK.’ by QUENTIN LETTS . Rupert Murdoch swore on a Bible to tell the truth. Minutes later, after he had assured us that he never sought commercial favours from prime ministers, there came a crash of thunder from the heavens. It may or may not have been an expression of scepticism from the Almighty but it lent proceedings an air of Scooby Doo, which invariably featured thunder and lightning, normally when the baddie was terrifying Shaggy. The inquiry is being held in court 73 at the Royal Courts of Justice, the same room where the Hutton Inquiry was conducted. Low ceiling. Joyless lighting. Polite but firm officials. Shades of a Dignitas clinic. Evidence: Rupert Murdoch gestures as he gives evidence before Lord Justice leveson yesterday . Beak Leveson wears no robes or wig. En route to the court I passed a wig shop in a street behind the building. In the window: two wigged, waxwork heads, one of them a ringer for Jeremy Hunt. Lord Justice Leveson sits on a dais before a dull blue curtain which may have been borrowed from one of those passport photo booths. Mr Murdoch, who dingo-loped into the room accompanied by a bodyguard and karate-chopster wife Wendi (in pale blue nail varnish), was seated at a sparse interrogation table. He scrunched his eyes, giving his 81-year-old face the appearance of a scowl. He could have been a character in a Pinter play. The day was intriguing chiefly for the personality of its star witness, this leathery, contemplative, gum-sucking abo’ elder of the global power pod. At a parliamentary committee last summer he seemed barely compos. Not yesterday. He may have taken a while to respond to some questions from the inquiry’s leading counsel, Robert Jay, QC, but that was because Citizen Rupe’s mental cogs and spools were swivelling, analysing dangers from every aspect, computing the ramifications of each word about to be glurped from his molten core. The voice was scratchy, sometimes fluting, whistly. Mr Murdoch said that when his Sun announced it was dumping Labour, Gordon Brown telephoned. The two men had a soft-volume conversation (they’re always the nasty ones) in which Mr Brown said he would ‘make war’ on Mr Murdoch. Mr Brown was not ‘in a very balanced state of mind’. Straitjacket for Gordon! Joint appearance: Rupert Murdoch and Tony Blair together at a news conference in 2008 . Mr Brown was one of several bystanders to take some buckshot in the rump. Sir Harold Evans, ex-Murdoch editor and a darling of the Left, was horribly punctured when Mr Murdoch alleged that this great Champion of Truth once begged his boss to ‘tell me what you want me to say’. Oooh dear. The late Woodrow Wyatt overstated his connections. Lord Patten had been a ‘very bad’ Governor of Hong Kong. When Mr Jay mentioned Fleet Street poohbah Andrew Rawnsley, Mr Murdoch drily asked: ‘Who’s he?’ A scribe from Mr Rawnsley’s sister paper enjoyed that putdown. The judge intervened occasionally, once after Mr Murdoch said prominent people should expect to be inspected by the gumshoes of the Press. Lord Leveson wondered if that was fair about, say, actors. Were they also fair game? One does hope the inquiry does not think politics is confined to parliamentarians and officials. Some of society’s most powerful people are in the arts and business. As for Mr Jay, he is that scruffy one with the stubble you may have seen in coverage of the inquiry. Could be a robber caught on a petrol station’s CCTV. Or the late Kenny Everett. If his questions seemed to move slowly, that was because they covered an impractically long period. A Right-winger such as I might have discerned that he was not a natural reader of The Sun. When he asked Mr Murdoch if he was a Thatcherite, he might have been asking if he had scabies. And a reference to editorial decisions made at least this listener suspect that Mr Jay regards newspaper readers’ views as being distinctly below the salt.","Mr Murdoch stands by the 'declare war' conversation he claims he had with Gordon Brown .

Portuguese police have dealt another devastating blow to the parents of Madeleine McCann by refusing to reopen the investigation into her disappearance, claiming there is no new evidence. But only yesterday, Scotland Yard said there were 195 potential leads in the case and declared the missing child 'could still be alive'. Just hours before the Portuguese announcement, Kate and Gerry McCann spoke of their hopes for a fresh examination of the case by Portuguese officials. Madeleine McCann as she looked aged three (left), and how Scotland Yard envision her now at the age of nine . This morning, the couple's spokesman Clarence Mitchell said: 'Kate and Gerry welcome this and they are hugely . encouraged by what the police have been doing all of this last year . since the launch of the investigative review. 'They (Scotland Yard) believe that it is quite possible that Madeleine . could still be alive and that is what Kate and Gerry have said . throughout the five years and they are hugely encouraged by all of this . momentum in the case.' He added that like the British police, Mr and Mrs McCann want the case . to be reopened but it is 'up to the Portuguese authorities'. But their hopes were dashed just hours later when Pedro do Carmo, deputy head of the . criminal police department, said: 'There are no new elements at the . moment that would allow for the reopening of the inquiry.' Detectives in Portugal were thought to be keen to re-open the case, despite needed judicial approval via the courts. The announcement is the latest in a . series of blows to the McCanns from Portuguese authorities ever since . Maddie vanished five years ago. Shortly afterwards, both parents were wrongly named as suspects and questioned by Portuguese police. Then, four years ago, the official inquiry into her disappearance was shelved. Her parents repeatedly called on officials to resume the search for Maddie, who vanished just days before her fourth birthday in 2007. Yesterday, the family released an image of how Maddie could look now aged nine. Speaking on the age-advanced picture of Madeleine, Mr Mitchell said: 'They are very pleased that the new age-progressed . image of Madeleine aged nine was put out yesterday, which is getting . wide publicity today. 'Of course, that is the girl that people should . still be looking for. 'We need to remind people around the world that this is probably what . Madeleine looks like today, not the very famous picture of her when she . went missing. This is Madeleine as a young girl now. 'Kate particularly feels there is a very strong family resemblance. She . sees Madeleine, Sean and Amelie her brother and sister, and herself in . the image.' Yesterday, the detective leading the Metropolitan Police review said the case could still be solved. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood said he believed her . disappearance was a stranger abduction, as he said there were 195 'investigative opportunities'. But police refused to say what evidence they had uncovered to suggest Madeleine was alive. Mr Redwood confirmed that his team of more than 30 officers involved in . the case had been to Portugal seven times, including a visit to the . family’s holiday flat in Praia da Luz. It will be five years next week since the three-year-old went missing as her parents dined with friends nearby. The investigative review was launched last year after a meeting between . former Met commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson and the Home Office. Five years of uncertainty: Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, still hope for their daughter's rescue . The National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children released these projections of how Maddie might look aged six and nine . Is she alive? There have been no confirmed sightings of Madeleine McCann since she disappeared on May 3, 2007. The original Portuguese police team believed she died in a ‘tragic accident’. Kate and Gerry McCann have always insisted there is no evidence to suggest she is dead, and British police now believe ‘there is a possibility she is alive’. Where is she? There have been reported sightings all round  the world, ranging from the credible to bizarre psychic visions. Of those investigated, none have been confirmed as Madeleine. Who is responsible? Three people were officially named as arguidos, or suspects, in the investigation - Kate and Gerry McCann and British expat Robert Murat. All three were formally cleared when the investigation was shelved and have won libel cases against newspapers and broadcasters which falsely claimed they were involved in Madeleine’s disappearance. The McCanns believe Madeleine was taken by an abductor. Convicted paedophile Raymond Hewlett allegedly said he saw the girl twice before she vanished and claimed she was stolen to order by a gypsy gang, but denied he was involved. He died in 2010. Are there new leads? British police have identified almost 200 new lines of investigation from the Portuguese case files and the McCanns’ own private detectives. They have refused to reveal details. Why was this not done before? Portuguese officers were convinced Madeleine was dead and have admitted publicly that they did not fully investigate other theories, including many of the sightings. What else was missed? Police did not set up effective searches and did not alert the Spanish border for 12 hours, allowing a potential abductor to escape with Madeleine undetected. Even a basic check of the other guests at the Ocean Club resort in Praia da Luz was not completed for 48 hours, by which time many potential witnesses had left. What about forensic evidence? Police did not seal off the McCanns’ apartment until 10am the next day, by which time the McCanns, their friends, resort staff, concerned helpers and police officers had all potentially contaminated forensic evidence. Samples were taken and tested for blood and DNA but were found to be so degraded and contaminated that the results were inconclusive. Will the case be solved? British police want the case reopened but public opinion in Portugal has not been supportive of the McCanns and there may be little interest in raking over a five-year mystery which has already damaged the country’s tourist industry. Even if the case is reopened, the reality remains that blunders in the first few days after Madeleine’s disappearance may mean the McCanns will never know what happened to their daughter.","Portuguese police say there is 'no new evidence' in devastating blow to McCanns .

The controversial replacements for the Harrier jump jets may cost taxpayers even more than their £500million asking price - because the heat from take off could melt aircraft carriers' decks. The fumes from the U.S. Joint Strike Fighters are so hot that special heat-resistant paint will be required to protect the take-off strip. But American military experts are still developing the coating, which the Britain will now have to beg for as well as the new planes. Takeoff: Fumes from the F-35 jump jet can damage ships' decks, US tests have revealed . The flaw is the latest problem to hit the ministry of defence's 6.2billion plan for two new aircraft carriers after scrapping the Ark Royal and selling off the Harriers. It comes just two weeks after Defence Secretary Philip Hammond was forced into an embarrassing U-turn over the purchase of the new jets. He scrapped plans to replace the Harriers with conventional F-35C planes, which take off from an runway, when the £2billion cost of fitting the new warships with catapult take-off systems was discovered. The Government then had to revert to the previous Labour government's plan to purchase 12 F-35B 'jump jets', at a cost of up to £500million each. The turnaround cost taxpayers an estimated £250million. The new heat-resistant 'Thermion' coating has been developed in America after U.S. tests showed that exhausts from the jets could melt ships' decks. Expense: The 170,000 square ft HMS Queen Elizabeth will have to be covered with heat-resistant paint . U-turn: The MoD committed to purchasing 12 £500m jump jets in an embarrassing turnaround this month . Wasted: The RAF's entire fleet of GR9A Harriers was refitted at a cost of millions just before Cameron's defence review scrapped the entire fleet and sold them to the U.S. An MoD spokesman said the cost of the new paint would be 'negligible' and were 'greatly offset' by the savings from not fitting the £2billion 'cats and traps' to the aircraft carriers. 'Work to identify a suitable deck coat is ongoing so exact costs are not yet available,' the spokesman said. The new aircraft carriers, HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales, are set to be completed in 2020. The project has been branded an 'omnishambles' by Labour defence spokesman Jim Murphy. A spokesman for the MOD said: 'The MoD will save £2BN by not fitting ""cats and traps"" and this will greatly offset the relatively small cost of specialist deck coating which has always been factored into our plans. 'Deck coating was always part of the STOVL variant ship specification. Work to identify a suitable deck coating paint is ongoing with our American partners in this project.'","MoD must pay for heat-resistant paint on new warships .

Thousands of women over 40 could be eligible for fertility treatment on the NHS under new proposals published today. IVF is currently only recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence for women aged 23 to 39 because the chances of success decline rapidly with age. However, NICE is now considering offering one full cycle of IVF to women aged 40 to 42 in draft guidelines which will now go to public consultation. Women struggling to fall pregnant could soon be offered IVF up to the age of 42 on the NHS . The health rationing body will also advise the health service to offer free IVF to gay and lesbian couples as long as they have tried - and failed - to have a baby at least six times using a private fertility clinics. Its previous guidelines did not specifically state that such couples should not be offered treatment and all bar a few NHS trusts do so. Each course or 'cycle' of IVF costs the NHS about £3,000. Nice does not know how much its proposals are likely to cost the taxpayer every year. But the most recent figures for 2010 show that nearly 8,000 women aged 40 to 42 have IVF privately. If all these women had had their treatment on the NHS it would have cost £24million. Dr Gill Leng, Deputy Chief Executive, NICE, said: 'Infertility is a medical condition that can cause significant distress for those trying to have a baby. 'This distress can have a real impact on people’s lives, potentially leading to depression and the break-down of relationships. 'However, in many cases infertility can be treated effectively – there are thousands of babies and happy parents thanks to NHS fertility treatment – which is why the NHS provides services and why NICE produces guidance on the topic.' She added that there had been many  advances in both treatments and in the understanding of different fertility techniques since the last guidelines were published in 2004. 'For this update we are using the latest statistical and clinical evidence to make sure that treatment for infertility is offered at a time and in a way which is most likely to result in pregnancy,' she said. The new guidance would also mean that women aged under 39 would be eligible for three cycles of IVF after two years rather than having to wait for three under the current rules. They also appear to remove the lower age-barrier of 23 for treatment. However, there are concerns that many cash-strapped health trusts will ignore the guidelines. Last year a report by MPs found that three quarters of health trusts were refusing to fund the recommended three courses for eligible couples. Specific recommendations have also been put forward to limit the number of embryos implanted during treatment as multiple births create more risks for both mother and children. In 2004 it was recommended no more than two embryos should be transferred during a cycle. Now NICE recommends single embryo transfer for women under 37 and in women under 39 if there is at least one top-quality embryo. Dr Leng added: 'New groups of the population have also been included in this update. These groups include people who are preparing for cancer treatment who may wish to preserve their fertility, those who carry an infectious disease, such as Hepatitis B or HIV, same-sex couples and those who are unable to have intercourse, for example, if they have a physical disability. 'The aim of these new and updated recommendations is to ensure that everyone who has problems with fertility has access to the best levels of help. We are now consulting on this draft guideline and we welcome comments from interested parties.' When published, the update will replace some but not all parts of the original fertility guideline. Until then, NICE said NHS bodies should continue to follow the recommendations from the current guidelines.","Nearly 8,000 women aged 40 to 42 had IVF privately  in 2010.

Jailed: Ian Maxwell, 61, from Wrexham in Wales - pictured here with grey hair and sunglasses - tricked three women into investing their life savings through him . A Falklands RAF pilot who callously duped his two elderly aunties and a third woman out of a total of £312,000 has been jailed for two years today. Businessman and financial adviser Ian Maxwell, 61, from Wrexham in Wales tricked the three women into investing their savings through him. One of his aunties, who suffers from dementia, was left £10,000 overdrawn and financially ruined after Maxwell blew her money and that of the two other women on items such as jewellery and an expensive car, Caernarfon Crown Court in North Wales heard. Judge Niclas Parry told the father: 'These were despicable offences which have led to financial ruination for vulnerable, elderly victims. 'The case involved a serious breach of trust. Your elderly and mentally vulnerable victims trusted you professionally with their life savings. 'Some of the money was wasted on items of lavish luxury.' Maxwell admitted seven fraud offences between 2002 and 2008 and £250,000 is still unaccounted for. Prosecutor Jonathan Austin said aunt Vera Davies, in her 80s, gave Maxwell £35,000 to invest in an Australian company, to generate an income, having been assured by him that her cash would be safe. But Maxwell didn’t invest the money and monthly payments by him totaling £27,000 had been paid with her own cash or other money that he had. The barrister said the payments stopped in 2007 when Maxwell was in financial difficulties. Mrs Davies’s sister Dilys Williams, who died in 2010, was swindled out of £172,500. She suffered from dementia and was extremely vulnerable. 'She couldn’t handle her own finances. In 2005 the defendant obtained an enduring power of attorney over her finances. It’s clear she trusted the defendant,' Mr Austin said. 'That money was used to help his failing business interests.' Using his power of attorney, cash was transferred to him. Mrs Williams had to live in a residential home but monthly payments from her savings couldn’t be made, cheques bounced and she became £10,000 in the red. Counsel said eventually social services approached the Court of Protection to overwrite his power of attorney. Better times: Maxwell is a former RAF flight lieutenant who flew sorties during the Falklands War . The third victim was Judith Rich from Bath who is in her 60s . She made four payments totaling £105,000 for Maxwell to invest in Australia in return for a monthly income. She got back £32,000 over the years but in 2007 payments to her stopped. Mr Austin said : 'She asked for her money back and never got it and had to seek financial assistance from her local authority because of the impecunious position she found herself in.' The money had been her 'nest egg' for the future. The prosecutor said £250,000 was outstanding and Maxwell stood to benefit by £16,000 from Mrs Williams’s estate. Defence barrister John Wyn Williams told the judge it was a 'tragic day for Mr Maxwell and his family.' Counsel declared : 'He stands before you a broken man.

Anthony Hill, 32, was caught trying to steal a £190 ladies handbag from upmarket fashion and jewellery boutique Folli Follie in Regent Street in April. It was the heroin addict's 37th conviction for 63 separate offences, including 50 for theft. He already has a three-month suspended prison sentence hanging over him following another bout of shoplifting in September last year. But Hill, appearing at Westminster Magistrates Court, begged to be given one more chance. Anthony Hill was caught trying to steal a £190 ladies handbag Folli Follie in Regent Street . Paul Brooks, chair of the magistrates, said: 'We have listened very carefully to the representations made on your behalf, and today we are not going to send you to prison. 'However, if you reoffend in the next three months, there will be two suspended sentences hanging over you and you will go to prison for six months.' Hill, who was given a second three-month suspended prison sentence, told the court 'it's no problem' when he learnt of a night-time curfew imposed on him. Mr Brooks said: 'We hope it is no problem, because we don't want to see you in court again. 'You are a prolific offender. 'On the next occasion in court, for a similar offence or indeed any offence, it is most unlikely the court will be as lenient.' Hill, a heroin addict, has 37 convictions for 63 separate offences, including 50 for theft . Hill himself gasped with surprise when Mr Brooks said there were 50 convictions for theft on his record. He hugged and kissed his partner when released from the dock, and thanked magistrates profusely for letting him go free. The court heard Hill, from Holloway, in London, suffers from psychological and physical impairments and has been diagnosed as bipolar. He has recently become engaged to his girlfriend, who is helping him to recover from heroin addiction and episodes of self-harming. The court heard he tried to swipe the handbag on April 4 to sell it on, because his benefits had been temporarily stopped. When confronted by the shop's security staff, he admitted the theft and left behind a CV with his contact details. He was arrested and charged with theft on May 22. He will be electronically tagged and have to obey a curfew for three months to be at home between 8pm and 6am.","Heroin addict Anthony Hill was caught trying to steal a £190 women's handbag from Folli Follie in Regent Street .

The measure is predicted to save 500 lives a year, and will see the price of a standard bottle of wine at 12.5% volume set at a minimum of £4.69 in Scotland, compared to £2.99 for the cheapest bottle of plonk in England. The proposals raise the prospect of cross-border booze raids from Scots who wish to avoid paying up to two and a half times the current price of alcohol. The price of a can of strong cider will rise from 45p to at least £1.17 under the planned changes. Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon with during a visit to Glasgow Royal Infirmary where she announced the Scottish Government is planning to set a minimum price for alcohol .

Meanwhile Scots will pay at least £1 for a can of lager while bulk-buy deals in England will knock the price down to around 65p. Scottish Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon made the minimum pricing announcement during a visit to Glasgow Royal Infirmary. She said: 'Cheap alcohol comes at a price and now is the time to tackle the toll that Scotland's unhealthy relationship with alcohol is taking on our society. 'Too many Scots are drinking themselves to death. The problem affects people of all walks of life. 'It's no coincidence that as affordability has increased, alcohol-related hospital admissions have quadrupled, and it is shocking that half of our prisoners now say they were drunk when they committed the offence. It's time for this to stop. 'Introducing a minimum price per unit will enable us to tackle these problems, given the clear link between affordability and consumption.' 'There is now a groundswell of support for the policy across the medical profession, police forces, alcohol charities and from significant parts of the drinks and licensed trade industry who recognise the benefits minimum pricing can bring - saving lives and reducing crime.' Raising the price of alcohol is expected to save 500 lives a year in Scotland . The Alcohol Minimum Pricing Bill is making its second passage through the Scottish Parliament after defeat in 2010 when the SNP was in a minority administration. Labour is the only party not to have supported the revised legislation when it was debated at the first stage in March this year. Earlier this month, MSPs agreed to a 'sunset clause' meaning the law could be scrapped in six years if the policy does not work. MSPs have previously banned discount deals such as two-for-one on bottles of wine, restricted ""irresponsible"" drinks promotions and advertising around premises, and set a requirement for age verification. The proposed minimum price first time round was 45p per unit. Ms Sturgeon said: 'Since 45p was first proposed as the minimum price 18 months ago, we have seen inflation of around five per cent. A minimum price of 50p takes this into account and will achieve a similar level of public health benefits to what 45p would have achieved in 2010.' Dr Brian Keighley, chairman of the British Medical Association in Scotland, said: 'Despite efforts to encourage responsible retailing by supermarkets, they continue to sell high-alcohol products such as vodka and ciders at ridiculously cheap prices to entice customers to their store. 'The trend for cheap alcohol and excessive consumption has a human cost. Alcohol-related illness causes one death every three hours in Scotland and the total healthcare costs are more than £268 million. 'This increasing cost could cripple the NHS with a financial burden that is no longer sustainable, especially in the current financial climate. 'A minimum price, as part of a wider strategy, could end Scotland's heavy-drinking culture and I am proud that Scotland's politicians are once again leading the world on public health policy.' A spokesman for Alcohol Concern said: 'With minimum pricing due to be introduced in England and Wales, the Government in Westminster should follow Scotland’s lead and set the minimum price to at least 50p to make a real difference.'","A bottle of whiskey will cost £14 in Scotland compared to just £10 for a supermarket own-brand in England .

'Tragic accident': George Dunning died after trying to climb back into a house was locked out of . A schoolboy who locked himself out of the house died after falling and smashing his head on the ground as he tried to climb back in, an inquest heard. George Dunning, 17, had taken the day off school while he was ill and left the front door open as he stepped outside. But the door closed behind him and he is understood to have tried to  scale a 6ft tall fence to get in through the back garden in Twyford, Berkshire. The teenager was found by a neighbour slumped in the front garden fitting and bleeding heavily from the head, the inquest in in Windsor, Berkshire heard. The inquest heard that George had been at home alone after his mother Wendy reported him sick to school after he was sick three times in the night. Mrs Dunning range her son from her workplace to check up on him at around 3.30pm. He seemed confused and disorientated. She left work early and returned to the family home to find her neighbour Hayley Bartlett hunched over George who was in a pool of blood and suffering seizures. He was airlifted by air ambulance to the specialist head injury unit at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, where he underwent emergency surgery but never regained consciousness. He died two days later, on November 30, last year. Police investigated the death but were left puzzled as to what happened. One theory detectives suggested was that George had locked himself out of the front door and had been trying to climb the six foot side fence to access the unlocked back door when he fell. Fall: The teenager was found in a pool of blood and having seizures after suffering severe head injuries consistent with falling from a height . Coroner Peter Bedford concluded that this theory was the most likely when he recorded a verdict of accidental death at the inquest on Thursday. Mrs Dunning told the coroner: 'We as a family are at a loss as to what happened. The only logical reason he sustained the injuries is if he had fallen when climbing the fence.' Detective Constable Emma Smith said: 'It is not known why George had left the house. It is believed he must have been climbing around the back when he fell.' The post mortem examination found that George had died from severe head injuries consistent with a fall from a height. Death: The street in Twyford, Berkshire, where the teenager died after trying to climb over a 6ft fence to get into the back garden while being locked out . Coroner Peter Bedford, in recording a verdict of accidental death, said: 'While at home alone George has apparently locked himself out of the property. It seems to me he deliberately left the front door but that has closed behind him. 'It's logical that having found himself locked out, the obvious step would be to climb the wall and gate to the side of the property to access the back door. 'However, because he was feeling unwell and weaker than normal he has fallen and suffered a head injury.

Four separate bombs were detonated in . a series of coordinated terrorist attacks in the Ukraine today, raising . fears that this summer's Euro 2012 football tournament could be targeted. Up to 27 people were injured when the . devices, which were planted in rubbish bins, exploded at short . intervals in the city of Dnipropetrovsk, authorities said. The Ukraine is preparing to co-host the European Championships with Poland this summer. The Olympic Stadium in Kiev, Ukraine, that will host matches in the Euro 2012 football tournament . England's first group stage match against France on June 11 is due to be held at the Donbass Arena, 150 miles away in Donetsk. Today's bombings are the latest blow for the country that had hoped to use the football tournament to showcase its modern outlook. A shadow has already been cast over the Kiev government, with calls for a boycott by Western politicians because of the country's jailing of its former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko. President Viktor Yanukovich said the bomb blasts were 'a challenge ... to the whole country.' The first blast occurred at a tram stop at 11.50am (8.50am GMT), injuring 13 people. The second explosion came 30 minutes later next to a cinema, injuring 11 people, nine of them children, the Emergencies Ministry said in a statement. The third blast followed shortly afterwards next to a park, injuring 2 people, it said. It was unclear whether there were any injuries from the fourth explosion which also took place in the downtown area.

Interior Minister Vitaly Zakharchenko immediately left for Dnipropetrovsk to head an investigation, police said. 'No-one has been detained yet,' a police spokesman said. Authorities offered no immediate explanation of any motive or say who they thought could be behind the bombs. But the prosecutor general's office said it had launched a criminal case classifying the blasts as an 'act of terrorism'. Dnipropetrovsk, 250 miles southeast of the capital Kiev, is one of the former Soviet republic's biggest industrial hubs and was a key centre of the nuclear, arms and space industries in Soviet times. The city provided a springboard for former President Leonid Kuchma, who was in office from 1994-2005, to rise to power. It is also the birthplace of jailed opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko. Bomb attacks have been rare in the former Soviet republic which will co-host the European football championship in June and July. But political tension is high because of the detention of Tymoshenko who was jailed for seven years last October for alleged abuse-of-office which she denies. Her imprisonment has prompted sharp criticism from Western governments which see her trial as political revenge by Mr Yanukovich, who narrowly beat her for the presidency in February 2010.

Nadeem Hussain has been jailed for 10 months after he carried out a road rage attack on a horse called Merlin and its rider . A white van driver who rammed his vehicle into a horse and rider has been jailed. A judge branded Nadeem Hussain a bully and said he had used his vehicle as a weapon. Hussain was driving along a country lane when Charlotte Watmough signalled for him to slow down. Instead, the father of five skidded to a halt and got out of his vehicle. Words were exchanged before Hussain got back into his van and drove forwards a few feet, past the horse and rider. He then slammed it into reverse and drove into Miss Watmough's mount, Merlin, pushing him into a wall. The animal panicked and reared up, causing the rider to lose her stirrups and have to fight to stay in the saddle. Merlin, a 12-year-old Anglo Arab, was later seen by a vet, who found he had suffered bruising to his fetlock. Miss Watmough, 20, who has ridden regularly since she was three, was left traumatised, with a sore arm, shoulders and neck, caused by the force with which she had to hold on to the horse. Hussain, 31, drove off after the incident in Baxenden, Accrington, Lancashire, but the rider noted his registration number and he was later arrested. Hussain, of Accrington, admitted dangerous driving and was jailed for ten months at Burnley Crown Court. He was also banned from driving for a year and must take an extended retest. Speaking afterwards, Miss Watmough, of Rossendale, Lancashire, said she was delighted with the sentence and urged drivers to show more respect to riders. 'I couldn't sleep': Lancashire student Charlotte Watmough, pictured with Merlin, was traumatised and suffered pain in her arms, shoulders and neck, while her horse was left bruised . She said: 'It's just brilliant, when I . got the news I couldn't believe it. I never expected him to go to prison . for that length of time. 'It will hopefully give him time to think about what he did.' The student, who is due to begin a course in primary school teaching, added: 'Because Merlin was rearing up, I just hung on trying to control him. 'I was screaming at the top of my voice, I thought I was going to fall off and get run over or be squashed by Merlin. Thinking back, it was really, really dangerous. I could have been paralysed. 'It was just so random, I was so shocked - it wasn’t provoked, I’m always polite. 'I’ve never come across anyone like that out on the road. 'I didn’t think he would stop until either I or Merlin was on the floor. 'I couldn’t sleep for about a week afterwards. I just kept waking up crying and I was referred to counselling by my doctor. It still upsets me and I’m nervous when I go out riding.' Sarah Johnston, prosecuting, said . Miss Watmough described herself as an experienced rider, having ridden . almost every day for 16 years. She had been wearing a specialised hat and a high visibility vest when the incident occurred. She was riding her horse on Back Lane, in Baxenden, on June 26 last year when Hussain's van came round a bend in front of her and, instead of slowing down, approached her at some speed. The prosecutor told the court that . Miss Watmough had put up her right hand, with her palm out flat, to . signal to the driver to slow down, but he made no effort to do so and . skidded to a halt. Terror: Rider Charlotte Watmough, pictured with 12-year-old Anglo Arab Merlin, had to fight to stay in her saddle. She said she 'could have been paralysed' in the run-in with Hussain . She had tucked Merlin in as far as possible and was effectively looking down on the van roof. At the time the horse was not frightened, as he was used to vehicles and traffic. Hussain got out of his vehicle, words were exchanged and he was said to have threatened to ram the horse with his van. Miss Watmough was scared and explained all she had intended by her gesture was to invite him to slow down. The defendant got back in his van, drove forward ten to 12 feet, slammed on his brakes and then reversed towards the horse, pushing him into a wall, before driving off. Defending, Martin Hackett, said . Hussain accepted there had been an 'altercation' but denied getting out . of his vehicle or reversing into the horse. He claimed Miss Watmough had . hit him with her 'riding stick'. Hussain agreed that reversing towards the animal and rider was dangerous and likely to frighten the horse, but said that he did not deliberately aim for the animal. Judge . Beverley Lunt told him he had intended to frighten the horse and rider . and his actions could have had very serious consequences. She continued: 'You behaved like a bully. You used your vehicle to intimidate and threaten. That's like using it as a weapon. 'People . who lose their temper and use their cars to threaten and intimidate, . and where they cause fear and harm, must understand the consequences . will be severe.'

John Norrish outside Exeter Crown Court today where he stands accused of raping a 33-year-old married woman . A woman who alleges she was raped by a hunt master after a black-tie ball had consumed around 20 alcoholic drinks, a court heard yesterday. The 33-year-old drank three or four glasses of wine in a pub before arriving for the ball where she drank another ‘four to five wines and ten to 11 vodka and cokes’. On a scale of one to ten of drunkenness, she said she was ‘eight to nine’, adding: ‘I was quite drunk.’ But she repeatedly rejected suggestions at Exeter Crown Court that she had consented to sex and made the rape claims only when her husband appeared at the scene. She denied that she stopped having sex only when she noticed one of her husband’s friends outside the vehicle who had seen the huntsman’s ‘white bottom’ through the window in the dark. It is alleged that John Norrish, 67, who was only vaguely known to the woman, approached her after her husband had left the annual ball of the Tiverton Staghounds at Cobley Farm, West Worlington, Devon, which was attended by up to 400 people. She said he offered her a lift home, which she accepted, but that once they were both in his 4x4 he groped and then raped her. Norrish told police that he was impotent, and said on his arrest: ‘I could not get it up.’ He later admitted having sex with the woman, saying it had been consensual. Norrish, who was master of the hunt at the time of the ball last July, denies rape. But yesterday his alleged victim told the jury: ‘He leaned across and tried to touch my neck and kiss my neck. I asked him what he was doing. I did not want to. He tried to kiss me. He was all over my face. ‘I was not thinking, I was so scared. I did not know what to do. I said I did not want to.’ The mother told the court that Norrish reclined the passenger seat, removed her underwear, and then sexually assaulted her before raping her for about 15 minutes. She said: ‘I was just crying. It felt like I had no control. He kept saying that I was pretty and how gorgeous I was. ‘I was lying there, not making any noise. I was scared and did not know what to do.’ The court was told that Norrish stopped when the lights of another car illuminated the makeshift car park in a field, allowing the woman to escape, leaving her possessions behind. His alleged victim said: ‘I managed to find the strength to push him off with both hands as he had sex with me. I bolted for the door and I ran back to the yard where the party was.’ Accused: Norrish, left, is the former master of hunting team the Tiverton Staghounds .

She rejected claims by Norrish’s barrister that she had been a willing participant who had removed her own shoes and underwear, and invented the story to explain herself to her husband. She sobbed in the witness box and said ‘No, no’ when she was asked whether she had jumped out of Norrish’s car only after realising that her husband had arrived. Robert Linford, defending, said: ‘I suggest what took place in the front seat of the car was utterly with your consent. ‘It was the reappearance of your husband which led to you saying you had been raped. You had to account for your actions. ‘You had taken your shoes and underwear off. You helped him move the seat back. ‘You were able to get him off you when your husband arrived back in the car park. ‘A friend who was with your husband looked into the car and saw the defendant’s white bottom. You saw him and that is why it had to be rape. ‘Once you had told your husband you had been raped you had to stick to that account to keep your marriage.’ Norrish is on trial at Exeter Crown Court over the allegations .

You helped him move the seat back. ‘You were able to get him off you when your husband arrived back in the car park. ‘A friend who was with your husband looked into the car and saw the defendant’s white bottom.

While a debate grows over New York City's proposed sugary drinks ban, Mayor Michael Bloomberg says he's fine with a change in state law that would cut back on marijuana arrests. Gov Andrew Cuomo on Monday proposed cutting the penalty for public possession of a small amount of marijuana, a change in state law that would defuse some criticism of the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk policy in minority communities. With three weeks remaining in the legislative session, Gov Cuomo said his bill to reduce the criminal misdemeanor to a violation with a fine up to $100 would save thousands of New Yorkers, disproportionately black and Hispanic youths, from unnecessary arrests and criminal charges. Reefer madness: New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo announced legislation that would make penalties for private and public possession of small amounts of marijuana the same . 'There's a blatant inconsistency. If you possess marijuana privately, it's a violation. If you show it in public, it's a crime,' Gov Cuomo said. 'It's incongruous. It's inconsistent the way it's been enforced. There have been additional complications in relation to the stop-and-frisk policy where there's claims young people could have a small amount of marijuana in their pocket, where they're stopped and frisked. The police officer says, 'Turn out your pockets.' The marijuana is now in public view. It just went from a violation to a crime.' Support: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the proposal largely mirrors the city police directive issued last year . New York City prosecutors and Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, whose offices handled almost 50,000 such criminal cases last year, endorsed the Democratic governor's plan. Bloomberg said the bill largely . mirrors the city police directive issued last year for officers to issue . violations, not misdemeanors, 'for small amounts of marijuana that come . into open view during a search.' Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance said it will help them redirect limited resources to serious crime, and key Assembly Democrats expressed support. Some opposition is expected in the state Senate's Republican majority, where a spokesman said they will review the measure once Gov Cuomo submits it. Possession of less than 25 grams was reduced in state law to a violation in 1977, subject to a ticket and fine. If the pot is burning or in public view, it rises to a misdemeanor that leads to an arrest. Gov Cuomo's proposal differs from . pending Assembly and Senate bills because it leaves public pot smoking . as a criminal misdemeanor. He acknowledged the existing approach . disproportionately affects minority youths, with 94 per cent of arrests . in New York City, more than half of those arrested younger than 25 and . 82 percent either black or Hispanic. He also defended keeping smoking pot a . crime. 'I believe the society does want to discourage the use of . marijuana in public, on the street. Violation: If pot is burning or in public view, it rises to a misdemeanor crime that leads to an arrest . 'Smoking a joint, I think, is a different level of activity than just being in possession of it,' he said. According to advocates for . decriminalising it, 14 states, including Oregon and Massachusetts, have . lowered penalties for possessing small amounts of marijuana to civil . fines in a movement that began in the 1970s. Since 1996, 16 states, including California, have legalised its use for medical conditions, though New York has not. Commish: Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said he faced criticism from City Council last year about too many arrests for small amounts of marijuana . Kelly said he faced criticism from City Council last year about too many arrests for small amounts of marijuana. He responded that they need to change the state law because officers can't simply turn a blind eye to it.

Assemblyman Hakeem Jeffries, a . Brooklyn Democrat and sponsor of the Assembly bill similar to Cuomo's . proposal, said the racially disparate arrest numbers are a consequence . of both the statute and the police stop-and-frisk policies.

Federal agents arrested 37 Boeing workers on charges of dealing illegal painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs at a plant that makes military aircraft used in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Following a four-year investigation, 23 current and former employees were charged with selling the prescription painkiller Oxycontin and other illegal drugs at the factory in Ridley Park, Pennsylvania. Another 14 people were charged with attempted possession of various drugs for trying to buy them.

Boeing employs more than 6,000 people at the Ridley Park plant, where the V-22 Osprey vertical take-off aircraft and H-47 Chinook helicopters are produced. The Osprey and Chinook are standard U.S. military aircraft used in Iraq and Afghanistan. U.S. Attorney Zane David Memeger said there was no evidence that the integrity of the work on any aircraft had been compromised. U.S. Attorney Zane David Memeger said there was no evidence that the integrity of the work on any aircraft had been compromised . He said: 'This investigation and prosecution focused not only on the sellers, but also on the users because of the critical role that these employees play in manufacturing military aircraft.' Vito Guarino, acting Drug Enforcement Administration special agent in charge, added: 'These sales placed the individual abusers as well as society at large at risk.' Boeing spokesman Damien Mills said Boeing cooperated with the investigation and took steps to make sure the employees under suspicion were in no position to compromise the safety or quality of the aircraft. The U.S. military is the primary consumer of the aircraft. All but one of those charged is a current or former Boeing employee. Another person was expected to be arrested as well. The employees charged in the case were suspended, Boeing said. Federal agents launched the bust early Thursday morning at the plant in Ridley Park, an industrial suburb a few miles west of the Philadelphia International Airport. The bust turned up the power painkiller Oxycontin as well as fentanyl, which is sold in lozenge form as Actiq. The Osprey (left) and the Chinook see regular service in Iraq and Afghanistan . It also found the painkiller buprenorphine, which is sold as Suboxone, and the anti-anxiety drug alprazolam, sold as Xanax, officials said. The investigation was triggered in 2006, according to Mills, when some employees contacted the company's internal ethics hotline with suspicions that there was illegal drug activity at the plant. He said Boeing launched an internal probe and in August 2007 turned its findings over to federal investigators. Boeing issued a statement saying it 'commends the U.S. Attorney's Office, and other federal law enforcement agencies for their rigorous and thorough investigation, throughout which we took appropriate steps to ensure safety of our employees and the absolute integrity and quality of the products we produce for our customers.' If convicted, those charged with distribution face possible sentences of 10 to 260 years in prison and millions of dollars in fines, the U.S. Attorney's office said.","Factory produces Chinook and Osprey aircraft used in Afghanistan and Iraq .

The Queen’s Jubilee flotilla is being paid for by foreign donors after British firms refused to contribute to the £10 million cost because of a ban on branding on the boats. The pageant of more than 1,000 boats, which will sail down the Thames on June 3 to mark the 60th anniversary of Her Majesty’s reign, is expected to attract more than a million spectators to the riverbank. But a Mail on Sunday survey has revealed that most FTSE 100 companies have not donated to the event, which at the Queen’s request is being funded by private sponsorship. Abandoned ship: The Queen's Jubilee flotilla is being paid for by foreign donors after British firms refused to contribute to the £10¿million cost . Businesses appear to have been deterred by the lack of opportunity to receive branding on the boats. The shortfall has forced organisers to turn to wealthy foreign investors. A number of six-figure cheques from America, the Far East and Australia has led to confidence among the organisers that they will meet the £10 million target. Organisers made it clear to potential benefactors that overt advertising would be banned to preserve the dignity of the occasion. Those who have failed to contribute include consumer goods company Unilever, which holds a Royal Warrant, and British Airways, the national carrier used by the Queen when she takes commercial flights. Celebrations: At the Queen's request the event is being funded by private sponsorship . The Queen does not want tax- payers’ money to be spent on the celebration given the mood of economic austerity. ‘She is very sensitive to that,’ said Lord Salisbury, the Conservative peer who chairs the Thames Diamond Jubilee Foundation, which is organising the event. Among the few UK businesses that have contributed to the foundation are HSBC bank, which has given £100,000, and Sainsbury’s, which is sponsoring two vessels. Lord Salisbury made clear at the outset that he would prefer blue-chip contributors, saying he did not want ‘to make it a Tesco pageant’. The UK headquarters of British-Dutch company Unilever are by London’s Blackfriars Bridge – offering unrivalled views of the event. Three of the company’s best-known products, Stork margarine, Hellmann’s mayonnaise and Colman’s mustard, bear the Royal warrant. The procession, from Wandsworth to Tower Bridge, will be led by Gloriana, a hand-built 88ft Royal Rowbarge, followed by a fleet of paddled vessels including coracles, American whalers and Second World War landing craft. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh will travel in tourist cruiser Spirit of Chartwell. The Sunday pageant will be the centrepiece of the four-day weekend’s jubilee celebrations, which will also include a concert at Buckingham Palace. Opt out: Among the British companies who have failed to contribute are consumer goods company Unilever, which holds a Royal Warrant, and British Airways . A source close to the fundraising effort said: ‘We accept the economic climate is difficult, but we were surprised a higher-than-expected proportion of donations came from overseas. It has been a pretty poor show from corporate UK.’ A British Airways spokesman said: ‘We’ll be releasing any plans we have in due course.’ A spokeswoman for Unilever admitted the company was not part of the pageant.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 03:17 EST, 22 May 2012 . A Victorian nun known as the Mother Theresa of Manchester has moved a step closer to sainthood today after Vatican officials approved her life's work as worthy of canonisation. Sister Elizabeth Prout, who lived and worked in the slums of Manchester over 160 years ago, could become the first female British saint in over 40 years if approved by Pope Benedict XVI. Theologians attached to the Congregation for the Causes of Sainthood have ruled that SISter Elizabeth lived out the virtues of faith, hope and charity to a heroic degree. Historic: Sister Elizabeth could become Britain's first female saint in 40 years if approved by Pope Benedict XVI . Officials are finalising a position document which, if approved by Vatican theologians and scholars, will be presented to Benedict XVI, who will then declare Sister Elizabeth to be venerable. The search will then start for two miracles for her beatification and her canonisation. A candidate for sainthood must have at least two approved miracles attributed to them before they can be canonised. The unexplained recoveries of two terminally-ill people after their families prayed to Sister Elizabeth are being investigated as possible miracles. The last British women made saints by the Roman Catholic Church were all martyrs of the Reformation. St Margaret Clitherow was crushed to death in 1586 in York for harbouring a priest in her home. A sharp rock was put under her spine, and a door loaded with rocks placed on top. She took 15 minutes to die. St Margaret Ward was hanged in 1588 after she helped a priest escape from prison. St Anne Line was hanged at Tyburn, London, in 1601 for harbouring a Jesuit priest in her home. Other Britons being put forward for sainthood as well as Sister Elizabeth include Venerable Mary Potter, the London-born founder of an order of nursing nuns in the 19th century, and Venerable Margaret Sinclair, a 20th century Scottish nun who died of tuberculosis after tending to the poor in Edinburgh's slums. Victorian Cardinal John Henry Newman and aristocrat Father Ignatius Spencer are also being considered. The latest development in the story of Sister Elizabeth's sainthood was revealed when exerpts from the positio were disclosed at a Mass in her honour in St Helens, Merseyside, last weekend. Sister Elizabeth was renowned for her work with poor mill workers and refugees from the Irish potato famine, which saw her branded a 'revolutionary' in her own lifetime. A 14-year inquiry into her life of 'heroic virtue' is sending its findings to the Vatican, and it could result in the Pope declaring her 'Saint Elizabeth of Manchester' in as little as five years. A Roman Catholic convert, Sister Elizabeth opened nine schools in England's industrial North West. She also set up an order of nuns  -  the Sisters of the Cross and Passion, or Passionist sisters  -  who helped women escape poverty by training them in the skills necessary to make a living on their own. The order now has more than 600 nuns in more than ten countries including Argentina, Peru and Chile, where the sisters are known for their work with the poor. The possible miracles attributed to Sister Elizabeth involve the unexplained recoveries of two people in Chile  -  a man suffering from cancer and a woman with a brain injury from a fractured skull. They are said to have recovered after their families prayed to Sister Elizabeth.","Sister Elizabeth Prout worked in Manchester slums in 1850s .

Ban: France's ban on full face veils introduced in April last year was the first in Europe - with Belgium following suit soon after . Belgian right-wingers have offered to pay a bounty to anyone who reports a veiled woman to police. The Vlaams Belang political party made the 250 euros (£200) offer today in the wake of face veil riots in Brussels. Filip Dewinter, a senior figure within the right-wing party, told Reuters the riots had made police apprehensive about enforcing the burqa ban. He claimed that the payment should put pressure on authorities to further enforce it. Mr Dewinter said: 'It's a textile prison for the women who have to live under it.' The anti-immigration nationalist party's stunt follows protesters hurling bins and metal barriers at a Brussels police station last week. The riot broke out after a Muslim woman was arrested for refusing to remove her face veil, or niqab. A Brussels police spokesman said he was unaware of the money being offered. But added that any officer who sees a woman wearing a niqab would issue a penalty. He said: 'When someone is breaking the law we always have to intervene, demonstrations or no, the niqab is prohibited.' Women in Belgium risk a maximum fine of 150 euros (£120) if they wear a full face veil in public. Mr Dewinter said he was not aware how many people had already responded to the offer of a bounty. A spokeswoman for Belgium's federal police said the legality of the bounty was a question for the judiciary, but if someone felt insulted by it they could file a complaint with the police. Police in Belgium are investigating last week's riots and arrested 13 members of the Islamist group Sharia4Belgium on Sunday, the police spokesman said. Fines: A right wing party in Belgium is encouraging people to report Muslim woman wearing traditional burqa or niqab face coverings to the police, so the ban on their use can be enforced . Sharia4Belgium was not immediately available for comment. Belgium and France both banned the wearing of full veils in public last year. Nicolas Sarkozy, who was French president when the ban was brought in,  had commented that the outfits oppress women were 'not welcome' in France. Canada announced in December that new . citizens had to remove any face coverings, including the niqab and . burqa, when they take the oath of citizenship.","Ban on burqas first introduced by Belgium's government last year .

Diet guru Pierre Dukan, a favourite of Carole Middleton, faces being struck off as a doctor in France for giving ‘dangerous’ food advice to teenagers. The celebrity nutritionist was yesterday accused of breaching medical ethics for saying slimmer pupils should be awarded higher exam marks than their fatter friends. Dr Dukan said in January that pupils should be able to opt for an extra exam subject called ‘ideal weight’, which they could pass simply by being thin enough. 'Breached medical ethics': Dr Pierre Dukan is being investigated in France after saying that thinner pupils should get higher exam marks . They would then earn extra marks in their Baccalaureate, the French equivalent of A-levels, which they take at the age of 17. But the French College of Physicians . yesterday lodged a complaint against Dr Dukan for ‘remarks which could . harm teenagers already struggling with obesity or anorexia’. The popularity of Dr Dukan’s . high-protein diet soared after Mrs Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge’s . mother, revealed she had been following it. Other celebrity followers include the . duchess herself and her sister Pippa Middleton, Jennifer Lopez, . supermodel Gisele Bundchen and Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins. Fans: The Duchess of Cambridge's mother, Carole (left), and singer Jennifer Lopez (right) are among a host of well-known figures who have followed Dr Dukan's high-protein diet . But food experts in Britain  and . abroad have claimed that the regime is a ‘health hazard’ because it . involves a very low vegetable and carbohydrate intake. The French College of Physicians said . Dr Dukan was in breach of article 13 of the medical ethics code, which . states: ‘A doctor must be aware of the repercussions his views can have . on the public.’ The Dukan is a complicated four-phase diet which promotes weight loss of around 7lb per week. It starts with the ‘attack’ stage in which users eat only lean protein and zero-fat dairy products for up to a week. In the second stage, dieters can add non-starchy vegetables on alternate days. Fruit and starchy foods are allowed only in the final two phases. Dieters are also told to drink two litres of water a day and eat oat bran to provide fibre. Dr Dukan says the diet is safe to follow and has claimed that 40 per cent of Dukan dieters have not regained weight afterwards. However, it topped the British Dietetic Association's annual list of the five worst celebrity diets to avoid this year. The BDA says cutting out food groups is not advisable. They also said the multi-million-pound profits from his diet food empire were not compatible with the code of medical practice. Dr Dukan defended his plans to reward . slimmer pupils with higher marks, after his scheme came  under attack . from the French media in January. He said: ‘There is nothing unhealthy about educating youngsters  about nutrition. ‘My idea would change nothing for . those who have no need to get thinner. But for those who do, it would . only motivate them to lose weight.’ Dr Dukan’s controversial schools . project came a year after a study found that almost half of the . traditionally slender French were now overweight. Despite still being officially . Europe’s second thinnest people, the report found the French are piling . on  the pounds with a diet of fast-food and TV dinners. It also revealed obesity increased . most in France in the 1990s, when the weight of the average French . person increased by 10 per cent between 1992 and 2003. France’s Obesity Commission president . Valerie Boyer said after the study that a major national action plan was . needed in order to slim down Gallic waistlines. It was back in October 2010 that Mrs . Middleton helped fuel publicity for the diet when she told an . interviewer: ‘I’ve been doing it for four days and I’ve lost four . pounds.’ Her daughter Pippa joked that 57-year-old Mrs Middleton was surviving on cottage cheese and prawns on the high-protein diet. The news prompted speculation that Mrs . Middleton was slimming for a royal wedding, and the following month . William and Kate’s engagement was officially announced.

Shocking news: Michael Tillett, resigned after having an affair with one of his flock, a mother of two who is separated from her husband . When churchgoers discovered they were to be addressed by their bishop at Sunday service, there was excitement at the prospect of a major announcement. And they weren’t disappointed – although the news wasn’t what they  were expecting. The stunned congregation at St Helen’s Church, Ipswich, were told their married vicar, Michael Tillett, had resigned after having an affair with one of his flock, a mother of two who is separated from her husband. The Bishop of Dunwich, the Right Reverend Clive Young, told worshippers bluntly:  ‘Rev Tillett is no longer your vicar because he has been having extra-marital relations with a parishioner.’ The 55-year-old vicar and his lover Anne Alcock, a lay chaplain with a teenage son and daughter, were believed to be in hiding together last night after he revealed the affair to a member of the diocesan staff last week. The couple said in a statement yesterday that they could ‘no longer deny’ the love they shared for each other. They said: ‘We regret the heartache that we have caused both to our families and friends. We felt we had no choice but to be open about the love that we had, and have still. ‘Realising the consequences for both our professional and vocational lives, we are spending some time away in an effort to take the spotlight off our respective families and to seek both peace and understanding amongst ourselves. ‘We would value people’s understanding and concern at this very difficult time for everyone but for all concerned the love that we have for one another is something we can no longer deny. We felt the only response was to tell the truth.’ Affair: Michael Tillett's wife Sue Tillett, 65, left,  and Anne Alcock, right, a lay chaplain that he is believes to be in hiding with. Mrs Tillett, spoke of her ‘distress’ at the way he had treated her, although she called for him to be shown forgiveness . Mr Tillett’s wife Sue, 65, spoke of her ‘distress’ at the way he had treated her, although she called for him to be shown forgiveness. ‘I feel great sadness, shock and bewildered that this has happened but I do not wish there to be any recriminations towards those involved,’ she said. Mrs Alcock, 49, is a director of Inspire Counselling and Training, formerly Inspire Christian Counselling, which offers advice on religion and relationships. She and Mr Tillett are believed to have fallen for each other while she worked at the church, where she was lay chairman of the deanery synod. Her husband Graham, 47, is deputy head at a secondary school in Ipswich. One parishioner said yesterday: ‘We were all shocked earlier this year when we heard Anne had split from her husband. ‘They always seemed such a perfect family. But no one had a clue that she was carrying on with the vicar.’ Man of the faith: The induction of Reverend Michael Tillett to Holy Trinity Church . Another said: ‘I can’t remember anything like this happening. It was right (for Mr Tillett) to resign – he simply couldn’t have carried on once people knew what had happened. He is meant to set an example.’ Mr Tillett and his wife were due to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary in September. They have a 28-year-old son, Benjamin, and Mrs Tillett has a 31-year-old daughter, Emily, from a previous marriage. Mr Tillett served as a trainee curate at Framlingham with Saxtead, Suffolk, from 1998 and became a priest the following  year. In 2001 he was made priest  in charge of Stoke-by-Nayland  with Leavenheath and Polstead and in 2007 he became rural dean of Hadleigh. From 2010 until his resignation last week he served as rector at  St Helen’s and two other churches in Ipswich – Holy Trinity and  St Luke’s. Senior clergy delivered the shock announcement at the other two churches on Sunday. The curtains were closed and no one was answering the door at Mrs Alcock’s four-bedroom end of terrace house in Ipswich yesterday. Mr Alcock said in a statement: ‘I would ask for respect for my and my family’s privacy at this time.’ Mrs Tillett was at the detached four-bedroom family home she had shared with her husband and was being comforted by the Bishop’s chaplain, the Rev Mary Sokanovic. A neighbour described Mrs Tillett as ‘an absolutely lovely lady’. A spokesman for the Diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich said: ‘It is with great regret that it has been announced that the Rev Michael Tillett will be standing down from all ministerial and parochial duties with immediate effect. The resignation is for personal  reasons and we ask for prayers for all those who will be saddened by this news. ‘Michael Tillett revealed the existence of an extra-marital relationship to a senior member of diocesan staff late last week. ‘Such an admission involves statutory disciplinary procedures which have been instructed. No further detail can be given in order that these processes are not compromised.","Congregation at St Helen’s Church, Ipswich, were told their married vicar, Michael Tillett, had resigned after having an affair .

The parents of three teenagers killed in a horrific coach crash during their gap year in Thailand have called for the Foreign Office to issue more warnings about the dangers of bus travel in the country. Bruno Melling-Firth, Conrad Quashie and Max Boomgaarden-Cook were on a coach bound for the northern town of Chiang Mai when it pulled across a six-lane highway into the path of an oncoming bus in the early hours of June 28, 2011. The students, all 19 and from south London, were just days into a nine-week trip, along with a fourth friend who escaped the accident with minor injuries. Tragic: Bruno Melling-Firth, left, Max Boomgaarden-Cook, centre, and Conrad Quashie, right, were killed in a coach crash in Thailand. Their parents want the Foreign Office to issue more warnings about bus travel in the country . They were on a coach on their way from Bangkok to Chiang Mai when the crash happened in Khlong Khlung, in the Kamphaeng Phet Province, shortly after midnight. An inquest at Southwark Coroner's Court yesterday heard the boys had not carried out a great deal of research into bus travel in the country, and their parents told the court they had no idea of the dangers. Coroner Dr Andrew Harris said he would write to the Foreign Office to suggest it publishes the same extensive warnings about bus travel as it does about motorcycle travel. Recording narrative verdicts, he said the trio were on board a Hino tourist bus which was just leaving a petrol station where it had stopped for a break. 'The bus in which the deceased was travelling took a wrong turn exiting the petrol station to make a u-turn in a turning point in the middle of the highway, placing it in the path of another bus which was overtaking at the time,' he said. Rescue efforts: Rescuers tried desperately to rescue the trapped holidaymakers . Wreckage: The three men are said to have died instantly . Changes: Polly Cook, the mother of Max Boomgaarden-Cook, said she wants the Foreign Office to update their website to include the fact that the roads in Thailand are hugely dangerous . The inquest heard the parents of all three boys had collected information about the huge number of road traffic accidents in Thailand, and felt although there were warnings about motorcycles on the Foreign Office website, there was not enough about the dangers of buses and coaches. After the hearing, Max's mother Polly Cook said: 'We want them (the Foreign Office) to update their website to include the fact that the roads are hugely dangerous. 'We would like the FCO (Foreign and Commonwealth Office) to update its website to the level that the US does, indicating that it's extremely dangerous travelling by road.' The inquest heard a statement from Jack Beagley, now 20, who was on the trip with the trio before they started university. He said they had booked their flights, but no other transport, and had been in Bangkok for four days when they bought their coach tickets to Chiang Mai from an internet cafe for the equivalent of £5 to £10. 'We hoped to travel around all of south-east Asia and did not really research transport in Thailand before we went on holiday,' he said. He added that they still probably would have taken the same trip if they had known the risks, but would have 'thought twice about buying the cheapest tickets'. The inquest heard the teenagers were picked up in the evening. 'The coach was very basic, the air conditioning didn't work and it was clear the coach was old,' he said. 'I don't remember there being any seatbelts on the coach.' He explained that they stopped twice and the second time pulled into a petrol station where they got some 'disgusting' food. As they pulled out of the petrol station, Mr Beagley said he remembered the driver stopping for what he thought was too long, as there was little traffic on the road. 'I can't think of any reason for the coach to wait as long as it did, I didn't see any traffic, and I think the coach could have turned right immediately,' he said. He described seeing lights approach the coach, 'all of a sudden that coach crashed into our coach'. 'It happened so quickly we didn't have time to move from our seats or brace ourselves,' he said. In the aftermath of the crash, Mr Beagley said he 'understood immediately' that his friends had been killed. The inquest heard that as well as the three Britons, a Korean tourist died in the crash, as well as the driver of the other bus. Advice: Coroner Dr Andrew Harris, sitting at Southwark Coroners Court, pictured, said he would write to the Foreign Office to suggest it publishes the same extensive warnings about bus travel as it does about motorcycle travel . Chan Noisri is reported to have been jailed for two years for driving offences after the accident - the inquest only heard there had been a 'successful prosecution' in the case. Gillian Melling, Bruno's mother, said she had left the boys to their preparations and said she had 'presumed wrongly' that coaches would be regulated. She said figures suggested there were around 12,000 people killed in accidents each year in Thailand, compared to 3,000 in the UK, and claimed these figures were 'massaged' to make them less damning. Ms Melling told the inquest she wanted the foreign office to 'take responsibility for their British citizens'. 'It would not take much, just a paragraph stating specifically that there's a huge amount of unregulated transport out there,' she said. Chiang Mai: The boys had been heading to the northern Thai city, 422 miles north of Bangkok . 'I had an idea of every other danger except buses, travelling by road, apart from motorcycles.' Mr Boomgaarden-Cook died of a severe head injury, Mr Melling-Firth died of multiple injuries, and Mr Quashie died of a head injury. Coroner Dr Harris said: 'This has been a harrowing and tragic inquest. 'It's never easy to hear an inquest into the deaths of young people.' He said he would write to the Foreign Office, telling the court: 'It does seem to me to be a reasonable and sensible solution to make that I could ask the Foreign and Commonwealth Office that if they have any evidence of unregulated bus travel that they should give the same warning for bus travel as they do for motorcycles.'","Max Boomgaarden-Cook was killed with Bruno Melling-Firth and Conrad Quashie when their coach swung into the path of an oncoming bus .

A brave two-year-old girl suffering from a rare killer liver condition has to stay in a cot under bright blue ultra violet light to keep her alive. Areesha Shehzad must spend 12 hours a day under the bright blue phototherapy rays in her cot to prevent lethal brain damage. The toddler, from Bradford, West Yorks, suffers from Crigler-Najjar syndrome, a rare condition affecting less than 200 people worldwide. Baby blue: Areesha Shehzad lies in her specially-made cot covered in phototherapy blue lights which help keep her alive. Family support: Areesha, who often has disrupted sleep due to the bright blue lights in her cot, is watched by her brother Subhaan . She is missing a vital enzyme that breaks down and gets rid of a toxic chemical found in red blood cells, and could die if the chemicals are not broken down. To help her live with the condition, Areesha now spends at least half of every day surrounded by 20 ultra violet blue lights. Areesha's condition means she has dangerously high levels of bilrubin, a naturally occuring waste product from the blood usually broken down by an enzyme in the liver. The UV rays from the blue light affect the bilrubin in Areesha's system when they come into contact with her red blood cells and skin tissue. By helping to manage bilrubin levels in her body and keep them at an acceptable level, Areesha is saved from long term damage. The lights do mean Areesha is often unable to sleep at night due and as a result is exhausted during the day and naps for hours. This means she misses out on play group and socialising with other toddlers her age. Areesha needs to be kept under the blue lights for at least 12 hours a day to help her body break down a chemical which could otherwise cause her fatal brain damage . Areesha's parents say her condition, which only affects less than 200 people in the world, has been emotionally draining on her whole family . Areesha’s Dad Majid, 37, from Bradford, West Yorks, said: 'It’s a difficult treatment for a two-year-old. 'She gets very frustrated, and trying to explain to a toddler why we are making her sit in such an uncomfortable environment is so hard. 'It’s like a prison camp for her - we feel so guilty forcing her to lie down in her cot for so long but we have no choice.' Areesha’s mum Salma, 25, said: 'I was so worried when we had the diagnosis and it’s upsetting that we can’t do anything to help her. Family unit: Areesha on a rare moment allowed away from the blue lights, with father Majid, mother Salma and brother Subhaan . 'We didn’t know much about the disease as it’s so rare and it was an emotional time for the whole family.' Because she is forced to spend so much time in her room, Areesha has become used to playing alone at night, when the bright blue lights prevent her from sleeping. Salma gets up to check on Areesha several times a night, and if her daughter is distressed she tries to distract the tot with toys. Born in October 2009, Areesha was just three days old nurses at Bradford Royal Infirmary noticed there may be something wrong. They initially thought that Areesha had jaundice, as her skin had developed a yellow tinge, but reassured Salma and Majid that it was nothing to worry about. After two weeks of phototherapy Areesha was sent home while waiting for test results. It wasn’t until the couple received an urgent call from the hospital asking to bring Areesha back they began to worry it was more serious. Areesha had dangerously high levels of a toxin known as bilirubin, a naturally occuring waste product from the blood usually broken down by an enzyme in the liver. The dangerous levels meant she was forced to stay in hospital for four months while doctors ran further tests and finally diagnosed Crigler- Najjar syndrome type one. Phototherapy has helped Areesha however the treatment becomes less successful after the age of four, because the skin thickens and blocks the light. The older little Areesha gets and the bigger her body becomes, the more time she will be forced to spend having the phototherapy, which could be more than 16 hours a day. This means a liver transplant is likely for the toddler, who is due to under-go preliminary tests next month at Leeds General Infirmary, and Majid is to be tested to see if he is a match. Fighting to stay alive: The younger will have to be kept under the blue lights until she is old enough to have a liver transplant . Unusual: Areesh's parents say they hope the blue lights she is subjected to won't affect what they want to be a 'normal childhood' Majid said: 'It’s very painful for both of us - we obviously don’t want her to miss out on having a normal childhood. 'We don’t know what will happen when she gets to school age, as she’s so tired during the day.' Areesha’s liver consultant, Doctor Patricia McClean at Leeds General Infirmary, said: 'Areesha’s unconjugated bilrubin level has continually increased and is around the 300 mark currently. 'We would expect a normal level to be between 5 and 20. 'Anything over 450 means there is a high risk of severe brain damage, and fitting.' 'I’ve worked here for 20 years, and in this time have seen only a handful of children with Areesha’s condition- around half a dozen cases. 'Areesha hasn’t shown any signs brain damage, as the phototherapy has ensured her bilirubin levels have been kept below the high risk level, but the family are aware of the risks and are looking into a liver transplant.'","Areesha Shehzad must spend half of every day under lights to keep her alive .

Disgusted parents today condemned primary school teachers after they set their young children the task of memorising a 'thuggish' song about threatening to kill people. Pupils at Abbotskerswell Primary School, in Devon, were told to learn the lyrics to the song entitled 'We're going to kill you' about the Ancient Olympics as part of a project linked to the 2012 Games. But the words more closely resembled a gangster rap than an educational singalong with most of the verses referring to extreme violence. Violent words: Excerpt of lyrics from a song about killing people that were given to children at Abbotskerswell Primary School in Devon who were then told to memorise the words . Abbotskerswell Primary School: The song sheet distributed to 'impressionable' pupils at the village school included the lyrics: 'We're going to kill you' and 'I'll break your arms and legs' Lines in the song, taken from a play called The Ancient Olympics: The Legend of Callipateira, include: 'You think you’ve got a chance, you think you’ll make us dance, but when you make your stance, we’re going to kill you. 'You think you’re really tough, that you have trained enough, but we don’t give a stuff, we’re going to kill you. 'I'll break your arms and legs, I'll make it that you’ll beg, for me to stop the pain, think again. Apology: Viv Clare, head-teacher at Abbotskerswell Primary School in Devon, apologised for the 'unsuitable' song lyrics . 'You think you're going to win, I tell you think again, I’ll put you in a spin, we're going to kill you. 'I'm afraid your time is up, I think it's time to ruck, so it's time that we showed our stuff, so the going just got tough, let me know when you've had enough, we're going to kill you. 'I'll break your arms and legs, I'll make it that you beg, For me to stop the pain, Think again.' Furious parent branded the song 'thuggish' and claimed the teacher could not justify such lyrics being handed out to 'young and impressionable children'. The first Olympics games, which started in 776 BCE, featured running, boxing, wrestling, and pankration - a type of martial art. The fights could be very brutal as they had no rest periods and no rules against hitting a man while he was down. The bouts continued until one man either surrendered or died but contenders tried to avoid killing their opponent as the dead boxer was automatically declared the winner. But the ancient Olympics were not just about sporting events but featured songs, plays and poetry as well. The ancient Olympics were as much a religious festival as an athletic event and were held in honor of the Greek god Zeus. Artistic expression was a major part of the Games and sculptors, poets and other actors would come to the Games to display their works. The play chosen by the school was a fictional tale based around a story written by a Greek traveller Pausanias, that described ancient Greece and the games, around 150 AD and translated by W.H.Jones of Harvard University in 1918. The play charts the adventures of Callipateira who couldn't attend the games because she was a married woman so donned a wig so she could go and help her son to become an Olympic champion. Inappropriate: Parents criticised the choice of song to to rouse Olympic spirit among pupils . The play book, which features many other songs as well as 'We're going to kill you', which can be purchased online through numerous school education websites. But Dave O’Neill, the father of one of the school's pupils, said: 'I’m furious that anyone would allow children to recite, rehearse and sing this song. 'It’s supposed to support the Olympics, and this certainly isn’t in the Olympic spirit. 'Children need a good education at an early age, not learning thuggish lyrics in school.' But the school’s headteacher, Viv Clare, has defended the lyrics, saying they were contained in a published educational musical about the Ancient Olympics that the school planned to produce to tie in with the Games. However, they have withdrawn the song following concern from angry parents. Ms Clare said: 'As soon as their unsuitability was brought to my attention, I told staff they must be withdrawn and re-written. 'I can only apologise to anyone who has been offended by these lyrics, and trust they have been reassured by our swift action to redress the mistake.'","Song was part of a musical production set to be performed by pupils .

A British soldier shot dead in Afghanistan on Friday has been named as Corporal Michael Thacker. The serviceman, from 1st Battalion, The Royal Welsh, was manning an observation post in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand Province when his patrol came under attack from small arms fire, the ministry of Defence said. The 27-year-old father-of-one received immediate medical attention and was evacuated from the scene by helicopter but died of his injuries. Cpl Thacker - who was born in Swindon, Wiltshire, had also served in Northern Ireland and Iraq and had completed two previous tours of Afghanistan. He was described as a 'soldier's soldier' and 'natural leader' by his comrades. His wife Catherine, who he lived with in Coventry, said: 'Michael was the love of my life. 'He was an amazing husband and father who will always be remembered as a funny, loving and kind man. 'Everyone who met Mike instantly liked him and through time came to love him.' Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Webb MC, Commanding Officer, 1 Royal Welsh, said: 'Corporal Michael Thacker had all the attributes of a superb Royal Welsh junior non-commissioned officer and he was exactly the man that you would want at your side when life got difficult. 'He was a soldier's soldier - a larger than life character, highly competent, fiercely loyal and hugely proud of his family. 'He had a great sense of humour, banter was his speciality and any time spent with him was time well spent.' He added: 'No-one ever left him without a smile on their face - he simply loved life. 'He was mischievous, fun, incredibly amiable and with a grin that would brighten the darkest of days.' Lt Col Webb said the solider, who has a two-year-old daughter named Millie, had a bright future ahead of him after recently being promoted. He added: 'He was a professional soldier and a natural leader. People were drawn to him and he recognised the role that he had to play. 'He knew exactly what was needed to bring out the best in those around him. 'He never shirked a challenge or took the easy option and this selfless commitment spread through those around him.' Frontline: British troops on patrol in Helmand Province . Cpl Thacker's younger brother, Lance Corporal Matthew Thacker, also served in the 1 Royal Welsh but was not in Afghanistan at the time of his death. Describing his older sibling as 'the best I could wish for', he said: 'We were more than brothers, we were best friends and words cannot express how much he will be missed. 'Michael is one of those people who would help others before helping himself. He could light up a dark room, always making people laugh because of his great personality. 'Devastated cannot come close to how we as a family are feeling. He died doing the job that we Thacker brothers love. He is a true hero. 'Rest in Peace. You will always be in my thoughts.' The MoD said Cpl Thacker was part of his battalion's fire support group. The unit was manning an observation post in the war zone when they came under attack. The fallen soldier was known affectionately as 'Thacks' and had two other siblings, Mark and Ashley. Major Jon Matthews, the officer commanding the battalion's fire support company, described him as 'a great man who will be sorely missed by all those who had the pleasure of working with him'. 'I am immensely proud to have known him and I am grateful for the zeal and determination with which he approached soldiering in Fire Support Company,' he added. 'Thacks was not only a soldier; he was a family man too. He was a devoted husband and a doting father.' Cpl Thacker is the 416th member of UK forces to have died since operations in Afghanistan began in October 2001. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said he was 'deeply saddened' to hear of the death. He added: 'It is clear he was a larger than life character. He was a credit to his regiment and I extend my deepest sympathies to his family, loved ones and colleagues at this very difficult time.'","Cpl Thacker, 27, leaves his two-year-old daughter Millie .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 00:58 EST, 8 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 00:58 EST, 8 June 2012 . A poet-historian representing a younger generation of writers will soon take office on Capitol Hill, overlooking the politicians, in a lesser-known post enshrined in federal law. The Library of Congress named Natasha Trethewey on Thursday to be its 19th U.S. poet laureate with a mission to share the art of poetry with a wider audience. The 46-year-old English and creative writing professor at Atlanta's Emory University distinguished herself early, winning the Pulitzer Prize in 2007. Great honour: Author Natasha Trethewey has been named the 2012-2013 US Poet laureate . Overcome: Pictured Thursday, Tretheway hugs friend Joshilyn Jackson (right), after she was named the 19th U.S. poet laureate . Trethewey will be the first poet in chief to take up residence in Washington to work at the library's Poetry Room for part of her term in 2013. As one of the youngest poet laureates ever selected, she also brings fresh perspective to an office more recently held by poets in their 80s. Part of her work has focused on restoring history that has been erased or forgotten from the official record and the nation's shared memory. She has researched in the library's Civil War archive to inform some of her writings. Trethewey won the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for her collection of poems, 'Native Guard.' She wrote of the Louisiana Native Guard, a black Civil War regiment assigned to guard white Confederate soldiers held on Ship Island off Mississippi's Gulf Coast. The Confederate prisoners were later memorialized on the island, but not the black Union soldiers.A stanza reads: . 'Some names shall deck the page of history'as it is written on stone. Some will not.' Librarian of Congress James Billington, who chose Trethewey after hearing her read at the National Book Festival in Washington, said her work explores many tragedies of the Civil War. 'She's taking us into history that was never written,' he told The Associated Press. 'She takes the greatest human tragedy in American history - the Civil War, 650,000 people killed, the most destructive war of human life for a century - and she takes us inside without preaching.' Cause for celebration: The English and creative writing professor is, at 46, one of the youngest U.S. poet laureates . Range of emotions: The professor was moved to tears during the ceremony, but looked happy as she chatted with friends after she was named poet laureate . It's a 'happy coincidence,' he said, that Trethewey was chosen during the 150th anniversary of the War Between the States. He was also impressed with her skill in translating a visual image into words and moving from rhyme to free verse - but always keeping her poems accessible. Trethewey began writing poems after a personal tragedy. While she was a college freshman, her mother was killed by a stepfather Trethewey had long feared. 'I started writing poems as a response to that great loss, much the way that people responded, for example, after 9/11,' she told the AP. 'People who never had written poems or turned much to poetry turned to it at that moment because it seems like the only thing that can speak the unspeakable.' She is the nation's first poet laureate to hail from the South since the first federal poet - Robert Penn Warren - was named by the Library of Congress in 1986. She is also Mississippi's top poet and will be the first person to serve simultaneously as a state and U.S. laureate. Proud papa: Father Eric Trethewey kisses her daughter as she is named the nation's 19th poet laureate; her father is also a poet . Her term, beginning in September, also coincides with the 75th anniversary of the poetry centre and a dedicated poet-consultant position at the world's largest library. Trethewey said she hopes to promote national activity around poetry and to engage with the library and people who visit the nation's capital. Past poet laureates have included W.S. Merwin, Kay Ryan, Stanley Kunitz, Robert Pinsky, Rita Dove and Warren - the Southern native who was an inspiration for Trethewey. 'The biggest thing that I learn each time is that I can find, I hope, the best words in best the order to convey what seems to me, often, so difficult to speak, what must be spoken.' Their agendas as the nation's chief poets have included readings across the country, newspaper syndication of poems and poetry readings over high school public address systems. Poetry lives in the Trethewey family. Her father, Eric Trethewey, is a poet and college professor. But when she went to graduate school, she was more interested in telling stories and studied fiction writing. 'On a dare that first semester, a poet friend of mine got me to write a poem. I did it because I thought I would prove that I couldn't do it,' she said. 'It was at that moment that something really clicked.' Her Pulitzer-winning poems also included her personal history as the daughter of interracial parents - and the story of her mother, who died at the age of 40. In 'Miscegenation,' a poem in 'Native Guard,' she wrote about her parents' journey to Ohio in 1965 for a marriage that was illegal at home in Mississippi. 'They crossed the river into Cincinnati, a city whose name begins with a sound like sin, the sound of wrong - mis in Mississippi.' Trethewey's next collection of poems, 'Thrall,' will be published this year. It explores her relationship with her white father and shared and divergent memory within families, along with poems about paintings and the history of knowledge from the Enlightenment.","Natasha Trethewey named 18th U.S. poet laureate by Library of Congress .

An insurance company is trying to avoid a payout for the Christmas Day blaze that killed three young girls, claiming their mother's boyfriend - and the home's contractor - had told a number of lies. The inferno at Madonna Badger's mansion in Stamford, Connecticut claimed the lives of her children, nine-year-old Lily Badger, seven-year-old twins Sarah and Grace, and her elderly parents. Now Utica First Insurance Company has filed a lawsuit claiming the policy holder Michael Borcina - who escaped the blaze with Madonna - had repeatedly misled the insurer since 2007. Refusal: An insurance firm hopes to avoid paying out over the Connecticut fire, claiming contractor Michael Borcina lied to them. He is pictured with girlfriend Madonna Badger, whose children and parents were killed . The firm claims he had failed to tell the truth about the number of his employees, his company's annual receipts and payroll, and the type of work he did, the New York Post reported. He also allegedly wrongly claimed his company, Tiberias Construction Inc., was not a . general contractor and did not carry out demolition, carpentry or . exterior work over three storeys, it added. If the suit filed at Manhattan Supreme Court is successful, no one would receive a payout - including Madonna Badger, her estranged husband Matthew, or the estates of the grandparents or children. Borcina's attorney, David Grudberg, said he is looking at the insurance firm's complaint and will be responding in court. 'We are very disappointed that Tiberias Construction's insurance company is trying to get out from under its legal obligations,' he said. Devastating: A blaze ravaged the waterfront mansion after smouldering embers from the fireplace were put outside and caught alight. It later emerged fire alarms at the home had not been installed . Devastated: Stamford firefighter Nick Tamburro pays respect outside the destroyed mansion. It emerged that Borcina's company did not have the required paperwork to be working on the home . Matthew Badger’s lawyer, Richard Emery, added: 'At first blush it certainly seems that the insurance company is trying to wiggle out of their responsibility to compensate Borcina's victims.' Emery has previously put the blame on Borcina, saying he would sue . the contractor after it emerged one floor should not have been occupied . and fire alarms had not been installed. In February, he said: 'That fact is that Borcina was the . contractor on the job. He was aware of the dangers, or should have been . aware of dangers, that a civilian would have been unaware of. 'The fact that kids were living in this house was unbelievable,' he said, adding the bereaved mother was not to blame as she cannot have known the dangers. Construction workers who were helping with the home's renovation were also questioned following the deadly blazed as police sought to understand the cause. Victims: (L-R) Grace, Sarah and Lily Badger died in the fire at their mother's home on Christmas Day . Tragedy: The three girls (pictured left) died alongside their grandparents, Pauline, 69, and Lomer Johnson, 71 . Mr Borcina’s company was also heavily . scrutinised during the investigation, and it was discovered that . several required forms were missing for the renovation work on the $1.7 . million home. The house did not have a new certificate of occupancy since the Badgers moved in, and Mr Borcina’s contracting licenses had expired at the time of the fire, it was reported in January. His contractor registration for work in the state of Connecticut expired in 2000, and his home improvement license for the state of New York expired in June 2010. It is also not the only time Mr Borcina has had a run in with the law over his construction sites. Greenwich Time reported that he owes almost $100,000 in from previous legal judgements, and is also in the midst of two other lawsuits from clients- one in Manhattan and one in Long Island. Stamford prosecutor David Cohen continues to review the investigation to decide whether criminal charges, such as involuntary manslaughter for unintentionally starting the fire, should be brought. After the deadly 5 a.m. blaze at Mrs . Badger's waterfront mansion, Borcina reportedly admitted he had taken . embers from a fireplace as the girls were worried about Santa climbing . down the chimney. Bereaved: The girls' father Matthew Badger previously said he would sue his ex-wife's boyfriend . Remembered: He has set up a foundation to incorporate art into school lessons in the girls' memories . Fun: Mr Badger celebrated Christmas a day early with Sarah, Grace and Lily and said they were 'very happy' He put them in a paper bag near a mud room outside - and they ignited and set the home alight. The . three girls, who had celebrated Christmas at their father's Manhattan . home the day before, perished in the fire along with their grandparents . Lomer, 71, and Pauline Johnson, 69. Mr Johnson was a department store Santa Claus who had worked as safety director for a Louisville, Kentucky, company. The day before his death he had worked as Santa at Saks Fifth Avenue. Mrs . Badger, 47, a former Calvin Klein art director, and her boyfriend escaped the flames. After the girls' funerals on January 5, she . reportedly tried to kill herself and is now said to be in deep isolated . mourning as she struggles to come to terms with the deaths. Matthew Badger spoke out earlier this week to reveal the grief he has suffered since his daughters were killed. 'The experience of memories about their lives has been one of tears,' he told GMA. Struggle: While Matthew Badger, holding a picture of Sarah in a tribute video created for the fund, has spoken out about his loss, his estranged wife is said to be in deep isolated mourning . Grief: Borcina is seen comforting Madonna and Matthew Badger at their daughters' funerals . 'Every time I open my computer and look . at pictures of them, I am moved,' he said. 'It was very difficult to . see. Why did this happen? I mean, it doesn't make any sense.' But he added he has channelled this pain into something positive, creating the Lily Sarah Grace Fund to raise money for public schools to incorporate art into their lessons. 'It's . really hard,' he went on. 'People treat their grief in different ways. Either they head straight into the wind [or] some people hide behind a . rock. 'I had a very hard time making sense . of what life was. The instinct of a father for me was that I needed to . love my children and that love I channelled into the creation of the . Lily Sarah Grace Fund. 'I need to try and make them have made a mark on the planet, and not have just died in vain.' Following the December 25 tragedy, Stamford Fire Chief Antonio Conte said the fire was the town's deadliest since a 1987 blaze that also killed five people.","Michael Borcina escaped blaze that claimed the lives of his girlfriend's three daughters and elderly parents .

The Middleton family have been invited by the Queen to join the royal party at the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant. The Duchess of Cambridge’s parents Michael and Carole will sail on the Elizabethan, a replica 1890s Mississippi paddle steamer, at the event on June 3, the Daily Mail can reveal. Although the duchess and husband William will be accompanying the Queen on a gilded barge, it is expected that the Middletons’ other children, Pippa and James, will join them on the Elizabethan. On the guest list: Pippa Middleton, her brother, mother and father have been invited to join the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant on June 3 . The fact that they are being included in the Royal Squadron – a handful of boats sailing behind the Queen – is a further sign of her cordial relations with Kate’s family. Shortly before last year’s royal wedding she invited Mr and Mrs Middleton, who run a company selling children’s party goods, to dine with her privately at Windsor Castle and subsequently included them in her carriage procession at Royal Ascot. Sources say the Queen appreciates how close her new granddaughter-in-law is to her family and feels their relationship continues to give her enormous stability. Prince Charles has also arranged for his former valet Michael Fawcett, who now works as his party planner, and his wife Debbie to be on the boat alongside the Middletons to ensure their day runs smoothly. Thames: Kate's family will be on the Elizabethan, a replica of a Mississippi paddle steamer . As Charles’s manservant, Mr Fawcett was even rumoured to squeeze the prince’s toothpaste on his brush for him. It is said Charles once declared: ‘I can do without anyone except Michael.’ Following the ‘cash for gifts’ scandal in 2003, during which it emerged that Charles had been selling off presents given to him during his official duties, often through his valet, Mr Fawcett was forced to quit. Within weeks, however, he was back at Clarence House working as a freelance events organiser and is still paid tens of thousands of pounds for his services every year. Other VIP guests on the vessel include Lord Coe, chairman of the London 2012 Olympic organising committee, and his wife, Lady Carole. Organiser: Prince Charles has arranged for Michael Fawcett, his former valet, who now works as a party planner to be on the boat alongside the Middletons to ensure their day runs smoothly . ‘Michael and Carole’s inclusion on Elizabethan has only just emerged and has taken a lot of people by surprise, but the Queen is incredibly supportive of the duchess and her family,’ said a palace source. ‘Boats travelling in the Royal Squadron are solely reserved for special guests of the Queen, which demonstrates just how far the Middletons have come.’ One of the largest charter boats in London, the Elizabethan is a recreation of a 19th-century stern-wheeled paddle steamer but with the interior of a modern restaurant and night club. The 235-seater vessel also has an upper-deck walkway which offers the largest outside area of any Thames riverboat and will provide its occupants with an unrivalled view of events on the day. The normal cost of a charter for the privately owned boat is £650 an hour. The £10.5million pageant on Sunday June 3 will see a flotilla of 1,000 boats and more than 20,000 participants take to the water in the largest celebration to be staged on the Thames for more than 300 years. Stretching more than seven miles, the cavalcade – which includes a remarkable floating belfry and several orchestras and choirs, will make its way down the Thames from Battersea to Tower Bridge, with an estimated worldwide audience of a billion. Every senior member of the Royal Family will be taking part, led by the Queen and Prince Philip who, accompanied by Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall, William and Kate and Prince Harry, will take centre stage on the lavishly decorated royal barge bedecked with flowers. Privileged: The Middletons' paddle boat will join the Royal barge, above, which will carry the Queen and Prince Philip, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry and other senior royals in the Jubilee pageant .

In a gesture of unyielding compassion, Jennifer Hudson is offering prayers for the man found guilty of murdering her mother, brother, and young nephew. The Academy Award-winning singer and actress wrote in a statement Friday evening that ‘the Lord will forgive Mr Balfour of these heinous acts and bring his heart into repentance someday.’ She and her sister Julia thanked God, their prosecutors, and authorities involved in the case, as well as those following the trial across the globe who offered encouragement. They wrote: ‘We have felt the love and support from people all over the world and we’re very grateful. We want to extend a prayer from the Hudson family to the Balfour family. We have all suffered terrible loss in this tragedy.’ The sisters concluded: ‘It is our prayer that the Lord will forgive Mr Balfour of these heinous acts and bring his heart into repentance someday.’ Hudson's former brother-in-law was found guilty of murdering her mother, brother and seven-year-old nephew in what prosecutors described as an act of vengeance by a jilted husband. The jury convicted 31-year-old William Balfour on three-counts of first degree murder on Friday, after three days of deliberations. He faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison. Hudson was in court to hear the verdict, and wept softly as it was read, according to the Chicago Tribune. She then looked at her sister and smiled. Scroll down for video .

The jury was comprised of six men and six women. Some of the jurors spoke to the press following their decision, saying that phone records were the tipping point amid a sea of circumstantial evidence. The evidence that helped seal Balfour’s fate was the testimony from a forensic investigator who told the court how he triangulated Balfour’s location using cell phone towers. ‘Once we were able to piece the timing together…we were able to put a timeline together,’ juror Paula Holcomb said, according to NBC Chicago. ‘We realised that he could not be at two places at one time.’ Explanation: Several jurors spoke to the press as to how they finally reached the 'guilty' verdict .

Balfour's attorneys proposed an alternate theory: that someone else in the crime-ridden neighborhood on Chicago's South Side targeted the family because of alleged crack-cocaine dealing by Jennifer Hudson's brother, Jason Hudson. During the 30 minutes in which they called just two witnesses, however, they presented no evidence to support that theory. Jennifer Hudson, who was in Florida at the time of the killings, attended every day of the two-weeks of testimony, sobbing when photos of her relatives' bloodied bodies were displayed to jurors during closing arguments. Known for wearing designer dresses on Hollywood's red carpets, Hudson wore toned-down clothes at the trial, often all black. Hudson, 30, rose to prominence as a 2004 American Idol finalist.

She said she knew Balfour since the eighth grade but always deeply disliked him. Balfour had lived in the Hudsons' three-story Englewood home after marrying Julia Hudson in 2006. He moved out in early 2008 after falling out with his wife, but witnesses told jurors he often stalked the home. The killings occurred the morning . after Julia Hudson's birthday, and prosecutors said he became enraged . when he stopped by the home and saw a gift of balloons in the house from . her new boyfriend.

"By . Christine Show and David Williams . PUBLISHED: . 01:00 EST, 21 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:27 EST, 22 May 2012 . Former President Ronald Reagan's foundation expressed outrage today after a vial said to contain his blood taken after a failed assassination attempt was put up for sale in an online auction. The Guernsey-based PFC Auctions claimed the blood was from a sample taken after the President was shot and seriously wounded outside a Washington hotel in 1981. As the bidding passed $9,700 yesterday, John Heubusch, executive director of the foundation, threatened legal action and said it would fight to stop 'this craven act.' Presidential fluid: The seller's mother asked the director of the lab that handled Reagan's blood tests where she worked if she could keep the tube . He said the hospital where Mr Reagan had been treated had assured the foundation that an inquiry was under way into 'how something like this could possibly happen.' The website for PFC Auctions showed a picture of a blood-filled vial with a label stuck to it showing the president's name. The glass vial is five inches long with a half-inch diameter, and has a white label with purple ink writing attached to it. The label reads 'Reagan Ronald', lists the president's patient identification and the exact date of the assassination, March 30th 1981. Reagan's birth date is incorrectly listed as February 2nd 1911. His actual birthday is February 6th of that year. Mr Reagan suffered a punctured lung and internal bleeding when he was shot by John Hinckley Jnr outside the Washington Hilton Hotel. Reagan survived the assassination attempt at the Washington Hilton Hotel in Washington, DC where he was for a speech. Sale: A seller whose deceased mother gave him a vial of Ronald Reagan's blood she had kept since his 1981 assassination attempt is auctioning the tube . Hinckley was later found not guilty by reason of insanity. He is allowed to visit his family away from the psychiatric hospital where he is being treated. Also posted on the PFC site was an image of a form from Bio-Science Laboratories that lists George Washington Hospital as the source of the vial, along with a statement from an unnamed person offering the vial for sale. The seller wrote that the vial came from his or her late mother, who took it from her workplace at Maryland-based Bio-Science Laboratories, where blood work and testing were done for George Washington Hospital. The seller said he had contacted the California-based Ronald Reagan Library and Museum, which is run by the late president's foundation, months ago and had been told that Mr Reagan's family would like to have the vial given to them. In a letter of provenance on the site, the seller claims : 'The test tube and the lab slip that I have are for his blood work to be tested for lead on. The testing was completed and the test tube was sitting on my mother's desk. 'At the end of the week, she asked the director of her laboratory if she could keep the paper work and the test tube. The director of the lab told her no problem and really never gave it a second thought. It has been in my family ever since.' Attempt: Ronald Reagan waves during his time at a Washington, DC hotel moments before he is shot in a near assassination on his life . Next move: The son or daughter of the woman who kept the blood tube after Reagan's assassination attempt (pictured) tried to figure out what to do with the vial . The blood residue remained with her family for three decades. After the seller's father passed away in 2009 and the mother died in late 2010, the seller inherited the presidential fluid. The seller said that an official at the Reagan Library had checked with lawyers, the FBI, the National Archive and other agencies before telling him or her 'everything was OK'. 'Since 30 years had passed by, he thought that it was simply something that was of no importance at this time and that I was free to do with whatever I wanted with it. 'He then stated that he felt the family would be interested in it being returned to them and if I was interested in doing so to contact him and he would make all of the arrangements. 'I told him that I didn't think that was something that I was going to consider, since I had served under Pres. Reagan when he was my Commander in Chief when I was in the ARMY from '87-'91 and that I was a real fan of Reaganomics and felt that Pres. Reagan himself would rather see me sell it rather than donating it.' 'Real fan': The seller really liked Reagan's economic policies so decided to sell the blood tested when he was wounded in 1981 instead of donating it . The seller claimed to have contacted the Reagan national library and national archives about whether they would be willing to purchase the blood. But neither entities were interested in the vial and paperwork - though they did threaten to have the seller investigated by police over his or her possession of the artifacts. Mr Reagan, who went on to serve two terms as president, died at the age 93 in 2004. A spokesman for PFC was unavailable for comment yesterday. Other items available for sale on the site include Winston Churchill's personal letters, a slice of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding cake, a Cuban flag signed by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara and guitars signed by John Lennon, the Rolling Stones and U2.","Seller claimed to have been was driven to auction memento rather than give it away because of free-market 'Reaganomics'

Silvio Berlusconi's accountant brought an amazing £16million in cash to the former premier's luxury villa to pay girls who attended his infamous bunga bunga parties, a court has heard. The eye-watering sum was revealed by Berlusconi's grey-haired accountant Giuseppe Spinelli during two hours of questioning as the trial of the sleazy politician who is accused of paying for sex with a minor continues. Prosecutors believe dozens of women were given money, cars and jewellery in return for spending the night with him and in return for attending his bunga bunga parties. Prosecutors believe dozens of women were given money, cars and jewellery in return for spending the night with Silvio Berlusconi (above) and in return for attending his bunga bunga parties . The trial has already heard how women dressed as nuns and police officers before carrying out seductive pole dances for Berlusconi and two of his cronies. The venue for the parties was the basement in the billionaire media tycoon's villa at Arcore near Milan and Mr Spinelli told the court how he brought the money to the house from his office over a period between 2009 and 2010. As prosecutors showed him a long list of bankers drafts and withdrawals from the former prime minister's accounts Mr Spinelli said: 'I was just following the orders of Silvio Berlusconi. Every slip had to be personally signed by him and I would then take the money to Arcore.' One of the young women who attended Berlusconi's parties told the court that she dressed up as a burlesque version of U.S. President Barack Obama to entertain the former Italian prime minister. Marysthell Polanco also said she had dressed as prosecutor Ilda Boccassini. Boccassini, known as 'Ilda the Red' because of her hair colour and what Berlusconi says is her communist political sympathies, is one of the prosecutors in the ongoing trial. 'I dressed up as Boccassini with a toga to make him laugh, and also as Obama,' Polanco told the court. Polanco, a striking 28-year-old from the Dominican Republic, said the parties were innocent fun accompanied by burlesque, but not pornographic, entertainment. Berlusconi denies all wrongdoing. He had a close rapport with former U.S. President George W. Bush, earning several invitations to Washington and even to his Texas ranch, but he never was able to establish a similar relationship with Obama after repeatedly describing him - and later his wife - as 'suntanned'. 'During the week the girls would speak to me and tell me what they needed and then on a Monday I would go to Arcore where I had a meeting with him (Berlusconi) and he would tell me what amounts to put in the envelopes. 'He asked me to bring the money in cash and I would put it in the safe at the villa. In 2009 I brought around €7,665,000 while in 2010 I brought more than €12 million. 'Whenever large sums were needed I would forewarn the bank and they would break it down into smaller amounts for me. The money was for the girls daily living expenses and for bills, that sort of thing. We helped so many people and we still do. 'Some of these girls had come from overseas and had nothing. They all needed help.' Berlusconi is accused of paying for sex with underage minor Karima El Mahroug, also known as Ruby the Heartbreaker, in February 2010 when she was just 17 years old and therefore technically a minor. In Italy the age of consent is 14 but paying a woman under 18 for sex is seen as prostitution with a minor and punishable by up to three years in jail. Mr Spinelli said: 'I gave her less than €10,000, probably around €8,900. One day she came to my office and her face was al bruised and she said her flatmate had beaten her up so I gave her €3,000. 'Another time after I had spoken to Berlusconi about her, I gave her €5,000 and I think on two other occasions when she turned up at my office unannounced i gave her between €100 and €300.' Earlier the court had heard from another witness Natasha Teatino, a guest at the parties, who described how Berlusconi had 'paid numerous girls for sex' after an evening at the villa. Berlusconi is accused of paying for sex with underage minor Karima El Mahroug, also known as Ruby the Heartbreaker, in February 2010 when she was just 17 years old . She told the hearing of one evening in January 2011 and said: 'Silvio Berlusconi paid numerous girls for sex. There was about 20 girls, some were in swimming costumes and others were in their underwear. 'I didn't see anyone completely naked and there were only three men present Emilio Fede (TV news anchorman) and Mariano Apicella (Berlusconi's singing partner on their album) who sang and played his guitar.' Ms Teatino added: 'At the end of the evening some girls left but around half of the women, around ten or so, stayed. I left, I chose not to stay and a driver took me home. It was my choice, I wasn't specifically asked if I wanted to have sex but when I accepted the invitation I knew what was expected of me. If I had wanted to, I could have stayed. 'My friend Ariel Espinosa stayed the night and she told me that she had sex with Berlusconi in return for money but he didn't just pay for sex with money he also paid the rent for some of the girls as well in return. He paid for Ariel's rent.' She said: 'The girls were all semi naked. We were in the bunga bunga room as it was called in the basement. They would perform erotic dances and the prime minister would touch them. I was a little bit upset after the party because I didn't get an envelope like the other girls.' Berlusconi has insisted that nothing untoward happened at the parties which were simply 'elegant dinners' and belly dancer Miss El Mahroug, who he is accused of paying for under age sex with, has also insisted that nothing happened between them. Berlusconi is also accused of abuse of office, with prosecutors claiming he had Karima freed from police custody when she was arrested for theft by wrongly telling officers she was related to the then Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak.","Accountant's revelations during trial of politician accused of paying for sex with minor .

Bosses at the Regent Road store in Salford closed the pumps when they discovered the mix-up. By then, reports were coming in of cars conking-out on the streets. Sainsbury's apologised and has already agreed to cover the cost of repairs to the vehicles. One of the car drivers, from Manchester, said the blunder had ruined a friend's birthday. The 35-year-old had filled her Peugeot 3008 with £40 of the wrong fuel.She said: 'I drove away and the car felt strange but I thought it was just cold or something. It was only 7.40am. I made it to work, but when I came back at lunchtime to go and meet my friend, it wouldn't start. I thought about phoning Peugeot and give them a hard time, but rang the AA instead.

A British soldier was killed in Afghanistan while on a daring mission to rescue a local police chief who had been kidnapped by armed insurgents. The soldier, who has not yet been named but was from 3rd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment, was a member of a task force fighting to save senior Afghan police officer Abdul Walid. He is the 417th member of UK forces to have died since operations in Afghanistan began in October 2001. Ongoing conflict: A soldier from the 3rd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment, has become the 417th member of the British forces to have been killed in Afghanistan since 2001 . Officials said Mr Walid, a deputy chief, was kidnapped at a police checkpoint in Payan village, in the Nar-e-Seraj district of Helmand province on Sunday night. British troops with colleagues from ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) laid siege to the area and recovered Mr Walid. But the soldier, whose next of kin have been informed, was killed by small arms fire and another British serviceman was injured. The insurgents escaped from the area but ISAF forces captured one mobile phone, some of their documents and explosives. Gulab Mangal, governor of Helmand province, applauded the British forces for their bravery.

Anger: Leigh Turner's wife Anita Turner was recorded telling her son that she his model girlfriend had 'ruined his life' The mother of a man accused of strangling his model girlfriend in a jealous rage was recorded telling her son that she had 'ruined his life'. Anita Turner, 51, denies helping her son Elliot cover up the murder of 17-year-old Emily Longley in his bedroom at their £350,000 home. Mrs Turner broke down at Winchester Crown Court yesterday as she described how she had told Miss Longley's grandmother that she was safe in her care. She insisted her heavily built son had not murdered the part time Top Shop worker despite having a row with her in the hours before her death. But the court was played covert recordings the police had made in Mrs Turner's home in the weeks after Miss Turner's death in May last year. In the tapes Mrs Turner is heard in conversation with her jeweller husband Leigh, 54, and Turner, 20, telling him to claim he had acted in 'self defence.' Indonesian born Mrs Turner tells her son: 'She kicked you and kicked you, even though she is slim she does kick boxing, it was self defence. Stick with it.' Later Mrs Turner is heard saying: 'You have got to stick to it that you didn't do anything.' When asked about her comments she told the court: 'I don't know what self defence means. 'It's what they say in the movies when someone has a fight and an accident happens. When I told him to stick with it I meant stick with the truth.' The jury also heard a recording of her telling her son that Emily had ruined his life. On trial: Elliot Turner is charged with the murder of girlfriend Emily Longley . He is heard saying: 'I was always the one who looked like the bad guy but she caused it. That f***ing bird. 'That girl has ruined my life.' To which Mrs Turner replied: 'She did, she did ruin your life.' Under cross examination Mrs Turner was asked if she Emily had ruined her son's life. She paused for several seconds before saying: 'No.' The court was also told Turner had sent a text message to his mother in the hours before Miss Longley's death saying: 'I'm sorry for my sins.' However Mrs Longley insisted this text was nothing to do with Miss Longley and her son was apologising for swearing and being 'horrendous' to her in the week before. Under cross examination Mrs Turner insisted the text message did not worry her saying: 'you have portrayed it so horrendously.' The court has heard how Turner, 20, had held his girlfriend's neck for 'five or six seconds' during a violent argument before she died. In his evidence he claimed he stormed out of his bedroom 'disgusted' with himself before writing a letter to his mother and putting it under her door asking her forgiveness. Pictured together: Elliot Turner and Emily Longley, pictured in the days before her death . Mrs Turner yesterday denied seeing any letter pushed under her door in the hours after Miss Longley's death. Simon Jones prosecuting said: 'You would do anything for your son Mrs Turner?' She replied: 'Not if he harmed somebody, of course not.' Mrs Turner claimed her son had woken her in the morning asking for her help because Emily would not wake up. She insisted she did not think Miss Longley was dead because she had struggled to wake her on other occasions and had even had to put a wet flannel on her face in the past. She said: 'I called her name. Emily was asleep with the duvet (on her). She didn't wake up so I just tapped on the duvet. 'I called, ""Emily, Emily, wake up, wake up"". She didn't wake up. I didn't think anything at all. I made a cup of tea and I still called her. 'I climbed on the side (of the bed). I tried to let her sip the tea but her mouth would not move. I called Elliot and we were both trying to wake her - we kept shaking her. 'I said, 'there is something really wrong - she does not move. He (Turner) said, ""I think she got a terrible, terrible headache last night"". 'I didn't know what to do. I called my husband.' On the beach: Emily spent long periods of her life in New Zealand . Investigation: Emily was found dead at Elliot Turner's £300,000 family home . Mrs Turner was asked why she did not call an ambulance and she replied that at that point she did not believe Emily was dead. She then said she peeled an orange in the hope the aroma would wake Emily when she put it under her nose. She added that her son was 'really gobsmacked' by what had happened. Asked if she knew straight away that Emily was dead, Mrs Turner said no. She was then asked if her son told her he ended Emily's life on the morning of Saturday May 7, and again Mrs Turner said no. The prosecution claims Turner strangled Miss Longley and that he was a violent and jealous boyfriend, fearful she was being unfaithful. He went 'absolutely nuts', it is claimed, in a culmination of a month of anger and upset over his suspicions that she was 'twisting his heart'. Family loss: Emily with her mother Caroline Longley . Flowers were left at the scene following the death of Emily Longley, pictured on a night out . Photoshoot: Emily, centre, poses with the Cheeky Buff Butlers, which upset her boyfriend Turner . When arrested he had his passport in his pocket and his bags packed, the court heard. He told paramedics the couple had argued and Emily had attacked him and he defended himself and then when he woke up she was dead. He told officers at the scene: 'I never meant to harm her, I just defended myself.' He then made no comment in police interviews. Computers seized from the home had Google searches for 'death by strangulation' and 'how to get out of being charged for murder'. Yesterday the court heard Mr Turner has admitted paranoia led him to believe a letter he found could have been his son's confession. He said that all he saw was 'Dear Mum' in his son’s handwriting and he had 'paranoid thoughts of what had happened' so he destroyed it. Mr and Mrs Turner deny perverting the course of justice. Emily was born in Britain but her family emigrated to Auckland, New Zealand, when she was nine. She had returned to live with her grandparents in Bournemouth to study when she died.

Reunited: Martin Robson Riley with his grandfather's World War One Medal that vanished 30 years ago . A World War One medal that vanished 30 years ago has been reunited with the soldier's grandson after he spotted it on eBay. Martin Robson Riley, 45, said he was left 'flabbergasted' when he came across the Victory Medal awarded to his grandfather in 1919. The medal, and one other belonging to Private Henry Riley, had disappeared from the family home in Bournbrook, Birmingham, but the Victory medal eventually found its way to a dealer in Cornwall who put it up for auction. Mr Riley, from Llandre, Ceredigion, . Wales, says it was 'sheer chance' that he found the medal on the online . auction site with a starting price of just 99p. Mr . Riley, who works at the National Library of Wales, said: 'I couldn’t . believe my eyes when I saw my grandfather’s name and regimental number . come up as part of the description for the medal. 'I . hadn’t been actively looking for it, but I’d occasionally type my . grandfather’s name and the word 'medal' into search engines to see what . happened and out of sheer chance when I looked last week, there it was.

He returned to the army and served with the British forces who occupied the Rhine after the war ended in 1918. Honoured: Private Henry Riley, pictured on his wedding day in 1922, was awarded the World war One medal in 1919 . The . medal’s dedication 'The Great War for Civilisation 1914 to 1919' is . because under British common law the war 'officially' ended in 1919. But the war took its toll and Private Riley died in 1927 at the age of just 28 so Mr Riley never got to meet the man whose medal he now owns. He said: 'My grandmother remarried and when her second husband died in 1981 we went to clear the house and the medals were missing.

Private Riley’s other missing medal, the British War Medal, was not amongst those being sold by the dealer.

Four-year-old Seth Skelton-Thake who is being forced to start his school days at a Sure Start centre, with his mother Mikala . And the youngster is not alone as primary schools across the country struggle to cope with the soaring demand for places. Figures released last month show that nearly a third of five-year-olds in parts of London missed out on their first choice. The statistics, published by the Pan-London Admissions Board last month, revealed that across the capital more than 20 per cent of youngsters did not get a place at their preferred school. Seth's parents Mikala and James, both 33, from . Withington, Greater Manchester, said they sent off applications to four schools within a day . of getting their application forms - and several weeks before the . deadline last December. A Manchester Sure Start centre similar to where four-year-old Seth could start his schooling in September . His mother Mikala, a nurse, said: 'I was stunned when I found out he had no place at all.

'This is no start to an education and there will be others . in the same situation. 'I’d rather he was taught at home than a Sure Start centre with younger children.' Manchester council has already admitted that dozens of youngsters are likely to be left without a place in September but declined to comment on Seth's case. Councillor Afzal Khan, executive . member for children’s services in Manchester, said: 'We are looking at . how we create more places in the city. We know there’s a problem and . it’s a problem across the country.' And competition for places at primary schools is not the only worry facing parents. It was revealed in February that thousands of children across the country face the prospect of learning in converted sheds and shops as the competition for primary school places continues to rise. Pupils have been crammed into makeshift temporary classrooms, and even vacated high street stores as immigration and baby booms make places harder to come by. According to the Department for Education, it is expected that primary schools in England will need to find space for more than 800,000 children of primary school age by 2020. This will mean up to 3,200 additional schools will be needed to cope with the additional demand.

Jailed: Christopher Grierson, 60, forged travel documents to defraud his law firm out of £1.2million in bogus travel expenses . A senior partner at a top City law firm stole more than £1.2million from his company to help pay for the upkeep of his Lebanese mistress. Solicitor Christopher Grierson, 60, handed his lover £280,000 and put her up in a New York apartment during an 18-month affair. But their fling ended when his second wife found out what was going on and he then resorted to stealing from his employers with bogus travel claims to cover his debts. The father-of-four, who had risen to become 'one of the most highly regarded lawyers in London' was jailed for three years at Southwark Crown Court yesterday. He made 57 false claims using forged documents between January 2008 and May 2011 while working for . international law firm Hogan Lovells. The solicitor, who once acted for the . Sultan of Brunei’s brother, Prince Jefri and worked on the collapse of . the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, defrauded his firm out of . £1.27million. Mark Ellison, QC, defending, told the court: 'In January 2006 he became infatuated with a Lebanese woman in New York and over the next 18 months, until his wife discovered the affair, he spent a total of £630,000, paying rent on an apartment and handing over £280,000 in cash and funding other aspects of her expenditures. 'There’s no doubt his spending had got increasingly out of control. 'He had amassed monthly outgoings of £32,000 not including credit card bills. With credit card bills it was £40,000.' The . court heard that in the lead up to Grierson fiddling his expenses he . had owned properties in London and France which both of which had 'large . mortgages'. But the . court was told Grierson used his 'trusted' position as a partner to . carry out a 'planned' and 'sophisticated' expenses scam to get out of . debt. Secret affair: Solicitor Christopher Grierson spent thousands paying the rent for his Lebanese lover's apartment in New York as well as handing her £280,000 in cash . Scam: Christopher Grierson claimed travel expenses for numerous fake journeys between Heathrow and LA that he never took . Prosecutor David Levy said: ‘Christopher Grierson, who was a trusted partner of Hogan Lovells - a very important firm of solicitors in the city - made multiple fraudulent travel expense claims totalling £1.274m. ‘Mr Grierson had the authority, because he was trusted as a senior member of the frim to authorise his own expenses, though he had to account for that with supporting documents. ‘He continued, over the period in question, to make significant claims which were totally bogus.’ The court heard the matter came to light when a fellow partner at Hogan Lovells queried a £42,000 claim submitted for travel from Heathrow to Los Angeles. It was found the claim had been made against a dormant client account that less than ten hours work had been carried out for in the past. Mr Levy said following the discovery ‘the matter began to unravel’ and Grierson, who was away from work through illness at the time, gave notice that he was to retire as a partner. He said: ‘He realised the game was up and enquiries had been made into his financial activities. ‘Thereafter he was seen by members of the firm and, as a result of their investigation, it became quite clear he had for a long time abused his trust in a very, very cynical way. ‘There’s no doubt that the motive was financial betterment or greed.’ Mr Levy said that Grierson, who was dismissed from Hogan Lovells in May 2011, had now paid back all of the stolen cash through ‘a loan from a client’. Grierson became a solicitor in 1976 and rose to become ‘one of the most highly regarded lawyers in London’. Jailed: Christopher Grierson was jailed for three years at Southwark Crown Court after admitting four counts of furnishing false information . But in 2007 Grierson had been diagnosed with a ‘depressive illness’ having already been treated by the Hogans Lovell firm doctor for depression and bipolar disorder since 2005. Jailing the lawyer, Judge John Price said: ‘Unhappily during the period of 2008 to 2011 you took £1,274,414 from your firm. ‘It was well planned, it was sophisticated - you created false travel documents - and you obtained substantial sums of money. It was a serious breach of trust. ‘But it is right to say that you have suffered from mental illness. ‘It is a result of that mental illness that in part you behaved the way in which you did.’ Mark Ellison, defending, told the court twice married Grierson’s illness had been triggered after the solicitor had been 'unable to cope with the enormous stress he felt after the BCCI case collapsed'. He continued: 'It had been going since 1994 but in 2005 it was terminated, he felt he had been working on something that turned out to be a complete waste of time.' The court heard Grierson had then ‘tumbled into a period of severe depression’ though he continued to work ‘inordinately hard’. From May 2009 to May 2010 he worked 3,500 hours and in October 2010 he suffered heart problems and underwent a triple bypass in January 2011. ‘Given the other financial difficulties he already had this behaviour was totally bizarre and, I would submit, a real indication of the extent to which he had become derailed with his thinking and judgement at this time of his life. ‘Such was his judgment around this time he even gave up seeing his doctor.’ Mr Ellison said while committing the offences Grierson was ‘metaphorically sharing the driving seat with a bipolar mental illness’. Grierson, from Roehampton, southwest London, admitted four counts of furnishing false information between January 2008 and May 2011. He was jailed for three years.","Solicitor Christopher Grierson stole from the company over a three-year period .

Easy street: Oscar Fuller, seen leaving court last November, has been cleared of a felony and now only faces misdemeanour charges . A man who punched a woman in the face over a New York City parking spot was convicted Tuesday of a misdemeanour assault charge, but cleared of a more serious felony in his second trial over a clash that left her brain-damaged. Oscar Fuller, 36, could face up to a year in jail at a June 18 sentencing. He was accused of knocking 25-year-old Lana Rosas to the ground, which put her in a coma and gave her permanent brain damage. Ms Rosas’ mother Angie Harrison told the New York Post that her daughter cannot work or drive and spends the majority of her time in therapy. ‘It’s a slow process,’ she told the Post. She stoically listened to the surprise verdict being read and left the court without speaking to any reporters, the newspaper said. Fuller felt vindicated by his acquittal on the felony assault charge, defence lawyer Thomas Kenniff said after the verdict. 'My client feels like he had his day in court and he stood by his innocence,' Mr Kenniff told the Associated Press. Six months after a previous jury deadlocked, another panel deliberated for about a day before deciding a case that stood out as an extreme even for a city known for space crunches and competitiveness. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. called it shameful that 'a petty argument over a parking space could escalate into physical violence.' The Los Angeles Times called the case an illustration of 'the weightiness of New York City's parking woes.' Fuller, however, said he struck out in self-defence. The electrician acknowledged punching Lana Rosas in the face during their February 2011 confrontation in downtown Manhattan. He was pulling into a space that she was trying to save for her boyfriend. Unconscious: Lana Rosas was knocked unconscious and fell to the ground after an alleged altercation with Oscar Fuller over a parking space in New York's East Village in February 2011 . Emergency: Medics and concerned passers-by rush to Lana Rosas' aid after the alleged attack in New York's East Village; she was in a coma for about a week and now has permanent brain damage . The blow knocked Rosas unconscious and off her feet. Then 25, she hit her head on the ground, was in a coma for a time and is still undergoing rehabilitation, prosecutors said. Fuller, meanwhile, drove off. Witnesses got his license-plate number, and he was arrested a few days later. 'This was a brutal and unjustified act of rage,' Vance said in a statement Tuesday. Fuller said he punched Rosas after she ran up to him and hit him first. He never foresaw or intended the serious injuries Rosas suffered, Kenniff said. 'He didn't act with any sort of intent to harm anyone in any fashion, and whatever physicality he used was in response to the assault that he was enduring from Ms Rosas,' the attorney said. Altercation: The incident happened on E. 14th Street in Manhattan's East Village; finding a parking space in the city has long been an uphill battle . Intent was a key question in the trial, as the felony assault charge required prosecutors to prove Fuller meant to cause Rosas serious physical injury.

"By . Neil Sears . UPDATED: . 20:50 EST, 8 March 2012 . Royal Navy submariner Edward Devenney was charged with communicating information on January 28 this year which could be deemed useful to an enemy of the state . A Royal Navy petty officer who works on nuclear submarines has been accused of offering military secrets to an ‘enemy’ foreign embassy in London. Submariner Edward Devenney, 29, appeared in court yesterday charged with a breach of the Official Secrets Act under a specific spying clause which carries a maximum of 14 years in prison. The court heard he first contacted the ‘enemy’ embassy in November last year, offering highly sensitive information related to his work. The secret services are believed to have set up a sting operation in January by sending officers posing as agents for the unnamed country to meet him. Devenney is said to have offered them information on nuclear submarines, including the operation of electronic warfare systems and periscopes, which could have ‘hurt’ the navy. Westminster Magistrates’ Court was told that Devenney, originally from Northern Ireland, was charged with offering information ‘prejudicial to the interest of the state’ and ‘directly useful to the enemy’, contrary to the Official Secrets Acts 1911. He was remanded in custody and told his next hearing will be at the Old Bailey in June. His barrister, Lord Carlile of Berriew, indicated that his client would plead not guilty, adding: ‘The defendant will say that the information which is the subject matter of the charge is not “secret information”, and is available to the public on reasonable investigation – and secondly he will say the information is not of interest to an enemy.’ Devenney is a prolific user of Twitter, describing himself on the social network as ‘Edward Devenney. Nearly 30. Royal Navy Submarine Service. Labour supporter. Lover of ducks and chickens. Trainee Feminist!’. Edward Devenney from Plymouth appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court yesterday . The submariner has tweeted more than 5,400 times – up to 40 a day. He has 184 followers. In his tweets he has regularly discussed his work, mentioning his deployment on HMS Trafalgar, which he described as ‘one of Her Majesty’s finest submarines’. In January he tweeted: ‘Bomb Iran? Am not bothered, but I’ll probably be in the Submarine that fires the missiles!’ Later that month he tweeted about his work on his submarine’s electronic warfare, or EW, system, writing: ‘Repaired a periscope and half way through repairing EW system.’ In February he wrote: ‘Did I mention that I’m on a £2billion state-of-the-art submarine and we can’t get BBC1 so I’ll miss Question Time? Oh I did? Sorry.’ Moments later he tweeted: ‘Being a clever chap I utilised one of the periscopes on my submarine and got BBC1. Not great pic but could watch it!’ And in the last month he has been tweeting about Argentina and the Falklands, writing: ‘So Royal Navy has sent a V-boat to Falklands, apparently. Can’t speak for MoD, but as a Submariner I’d imagine that’s absolute b*******.’ Devenney has also tweeted about the Russian election and attacked David Cameron. Last month he tweeted ‘Cameron is putting his political pride before the best interests of the Service’, and, when the Prime Minister visited HMS Vigilant in Scotland, ‘Cameron visited my submarine today but I wasn’t there. Wish I was to give him a piece of my mind’. He has also tweeted directly to MPs and political figures including Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, former Labour deputy leader Lord Prescott and Labour activist and reality TV star Sally Bercow, wife of the Commons Speaker John Bercow. Devenney has been living at the onshore naval barracks HMS Drake at Plymouth in Devon when not on manoeuvres in a nuclear submarine or staying with his girlfriend’s family in Barnstaple in the county. He was shortly due to begin serving on HMS Vigilant, a submarine which carries Trident nuclear missiles. He has also served on HMS Trafalgar, a hunter killer submarine. Devenney had been enjoying a promising career in the Navy, with the service sponsoring him to take time away from sea to study for a degree in electronic engineering. He had also passed exams giving him a place on a course to become a commissioned navy officer – but budget cuts are understood to have led to that career move being scrapped.",Edward Devenney charged with breach of Official Secrets Act .

Rachel and Paul Chandler said they had the support of family and friends who raised half a million pounds of ransom money for them. They were kidnapped in the Indian Ocean in October 2009 and held separately for more than a year. Mr Chandler said those around them had been 'wonderful'. Back on the waves: Paul and Rachel Chandler plan to finish the round-the-world sailing trip upon which they were kidnapped by Somali pirates in the Indian Ocean in October 2009 . 'They want us to get our lives back, and life for us at the moment is travelling and sailing,' he told BBC Radio Five Live. 'I think they are relaxed about it, I . don't think they would be very positive if we were to be captured again, . but we had bad luck, we were in the wrong place at the wrong time, and . the chances of it happening again are incredibly small.' Mrs Chandler said: 'From day one, our . close family and friends were very keen that we should get back to . normal, they were very worried that would be permanently scarred by what . had happened to us. 'I think it was reassuring to them . that, having found out that we had our boat back, that the Navy had . brought our boat back for us, for them to know that we did actually want . to restore it, and get back to cruising to get our lives back again, . was reassuring to them.' Terrifying: The couple were held hostage by gun-toting pirates who stormed their yacht, Lynn Rival, near the Seychelles .

Overseas again: The couple previously said they want to sail the Lynn Rival, pictured here in 2009, across the Atlantic to the Caribbean .

The retired pair, from Tunbridge Wells in Kent, were released in November 2010 after a ransom was paid.

Prison visit: Sheila Lee was on her way to see paedophile Anthony Barry Lee in jail when she veering into the path of another car . The pensioner who caused the head-on collision which killed a father and son and left his wife and daughter fighting for their lives, was on her way to visit her paedophile husband in prison. Sheila Lee, 70, was heading to Doncaster jail when her car veered into the path of the VW Golf being driven by Derek Sarkar, 47, according to police. He and front seat passenger Ethan, 14, were killed instantly. Mrs Lee also died from her injuries following the impact on Saturday afternoon. It has now emerged she was on her way to visit Anthony Barry Lee, 67, who police described as a ‘monster’ for sex crimes against two generations of the same family, spread over 21 years. He was jailed for seven years for indecently assaulting the older victim repeatedly when she was aged ten to 17, and then, more than a decade later, assaulting that woman’s daughter three times, when she was aged between five and ten. York Crown Court heard he committed the offences when other people were present. Detective Inspector Shaun Page, of York and Selby Protecting Vulnerable Persons Unit, said after the trial in December, last year: ‘Anthony Barry Lee is a monster who preyed on his victims over a substantial period of time. 'Prison is the best place for him and will hopefully help him to realise the magnitude of his vile and heartless crimes.' Lee, of, Wigginton, Yorkshire, was put on the sex offenders’ register for life and made subject to a sexual offences prevention order for an indefinite period. Mrs Lee’s daughter had also been travelling to the prison in a separate car some distance behind and came across the scene. Scroll down for video . Devastation: Front seat passenger Ethan Sarkar was pronounced dead at the scene along side Derek Sarkar, pictured with his nine-year-old daughter, whose face has been obscured to protect her identity . Horror: The car driven by Sheila Lee veered across the carriageway, ploughing into the VW Golf driven by Derek Sarkar, right, killing him and son Ethan, left, and seriously injuring daughter Abbie and wife Karen . The devastating accident provoked a huge . emergency services response with two air ambulances, three land . ambulances and two rapid response paramedic units joining firefighters . and police at the remote scene near the village of East Cowick, East . Yorkshire. The investigation and clear-up operation took more than seven hours before the road was reopened. Derek Sarkar and his family, from Sheldon in Birmingham, are believed to have been on an Easter break. Devastation: Karen Sarkar was airlifted to Leeds General Infirmary where she is in a critical condition . A . police spokesman said: ‘It appears the Volvo crossed on to the wrong . side of the carriageway into the path of the oncoming Golf.’ Mr Sarkar and Ethan were pronounced dead after the crash shortly after 1.30pm on Saturday afternoon. Mr . Sarkar’s wife, Karen, 43, and their nine-year-old daughter Abbie were . airlifted to Leeds General Infirmary, where they were in a critical . condition. Witnesses told how they ran to the scene of the crash and could hear a child screaming. Debbie Hinchliffe, who lives a short distance from the bridge over the Aire and Calder Navigation canal, said she found Mrs Stavert-Lee unconscious in the Volvo, which had smoke pouring from its front. She said: ‘I was standing at my  gate and I heard the crash. I ran to  the scene. ‘The old lady was unconscious and people were screaming in the back of the other car. I couldn’t get anybody out. ‘The car was going to catch fire with the old lady in. ‘So I got in the car with her to turn the ignition off. I released her seatbelt and just stuck with her. I couldn’t do anything else.’ Mrs Hinchliffe said it was clear that both Mr Sarkar and his son were already dead. Within minutes other people arrived at the scene, including emergency services, and they were able to free the occupants from the mangled wreckage. Wreckage: A badly damaged car at the scene of the crash in which three people were killed . Locals complain the stretch of road is a death trap and the scene of regular accidents . Mrs Hinchliffe said she took the . pensioner’s shocked daughter to her house. Police arrived a short time . later to tell her that her mother had died. Mrs Hinchliffe claimed the stretch of road, which has a 40mph limit, was an accident blackspot. ‘There’s . accidents every other week,’ she added. ‘We want speed cameras. You . take your life in your hands every time you pull out. ‘How many accidents and deaths is it going to take before they  do something? ‘We have to live with this on a daily basis. It’s horrendous.’ Hugh Dales, a 55-year-old construction worker, said: ‘There are two or three serious accidents here each year. ‘They came out and did tests  and decided the speed limit  was correct. ‘My wife was told that as there had not been any fatalities there was nothing they could do. Both drivers and a 14-year-old passengers were killed when these two cars collided in Goole, Yorkshire, yesterday . ‘It’s shocking that they have had to wait for somebody to die.’ Last night a neighbour of the Sarkars said: ‘They were an absolutely lovely family, just lovely. ‘We all used to pop in and out of each other’s houses all the time, to chat and do things for each other. ‘Derek used to tease me about anything he could and the kids were really nice kids.’ n A father died yesterday while trying to rescue his son after a giant wave swept him out to sea.

'Tragic circumstances': Tegan Hancox (pictured) was found hanging from her top bunk with a bag strap around her neck, possibly as a result of sleepwalking, an inquest heard . A four-year-old girl who accidentally hanged herself in the night with her Hello Kitty bag had a history of walking in her sleep, an inquest heard. Tegan Hancox often climbed out of her cabin bed and spoke 'gibberish' without remembering a thing about it the next day. She was found hanging from the top of her bunk on December 16 with the bag strap wrapped around her neck. The bag had been on the floor when the youngster went to bed the previous evening. Tegan’s devastated mum, Becky Hancox, told the hearing in Coventry yesterday there had been four or five episodes of her daughter sleepwalking in the past, a condition she may have inherited from her father. Miss Hancox, 24, said: 'Other than being possessed, the only thing I can think of is that she was sleep-walking. If she had been playing she would have made a noise. 'She had sleepwalked four or five times. She would just get out of bed normally, come to the top of the stairs and talk gibberish. 'She wasn’t awake and would have no recollection of it in the morning. Her biological dad was bad for sleepwalking.' The accident happened in the room Tegan shared with her younger sister Tayla, in Westcotes, Tile Hill. Their older sister, Chanelle, slept in another room. It was nine days before Christmas and nine days after Tegan’s fourth birthday when the tragedy happened. Consultant paediatrician, Dr Peter Sidebotham, told the inquest that the girls’ stepfather, Stephen Shreenan, 23, had put them to bed at 7.30pm on December 15, and checked on them again half-an-hour later. He said Becky and Stephen slept downstairs, but at 7am were woken by seven-year-old Chanelle. Devastated: Tegan's mother, Becky Hancox, pictured with the youngster's sisters Tayla (left) and Chanelle, said her daughter would often talk 'gibberish' while sleepwalking and not remember it in the morning . Tragedy: Tegan (left) and (right) in fancy dress, may have inherited her sleepwalking from her biological father . Dr Sidebotham said: 'Chanelle came down to say Tegan was hanging from the bed and that she thought she was dead. They found her hanging from the edge of the bed from the strap of a bag. 'Her feet were only two inches off the floor. Becky lifted her down and started resuscitation, but Tegan appeared very obviously dead. Stephen said the bag had been on the floor the previous night.' The doctor added: 'There is nothing to suggest it was anything other than a tragic accident.' A pathologist gave the cause of death as hanging. Recording . a verdict of accidental death, Coventry coroner Sean McGovern told Miss . Hancox: 'It seems to me that sleepwalking was possible and would . explain what happened, but it’s something we will never know the answer . to. 'You have lost a four-year-old in tragic circumstances. Nothing I can say will make it better for you.' Speaking . after the hearing, Miss Hancox said she was campaigning to improve the . design of the sew-it-yourself bag and the cabin bed. Wants changes: Miss Hancox (left) says she is campaigning to improve the design of the sew-it-yourself Hello Kitty bag after Tegan was found hanging by the strap of her bag, like the one pictured above .

Possible changes could include quick-release safety straps on all children’s bags, and cabin beds without side slats. Tegan’s family and friends are set to take part in two big events this month to buy her a headstone. They are taking part in the Coventry Walkathon on May 13 and are hosting a fun day at Saracens RFC, in Binley, on May 20. Tegan is buried at Wolvey Cemetery. Any cash left over will go to giving the family, who now live in Willenhall, a much-needed holiday. After Tegan’s death, Becky and Stephen put their wedding on hold, but are now looking forward to tying the knot in August.","Tegan Hancox found with her feet only two inches off the floor, inquest told .

"PUBLISHED: . 12:48 EST, 17 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:25 EST, 17 May 2012 . Victim: Lance Corporal Michael Pritchard, 22, died while guarding a road where fellow British soldiers thought they had seen insurgents . A sniper who is believed to have shot a comrade he thought was a Taliban insurgent in Afghanistan has told an inquest he had not been trained to fire his rifle in the dark. Lance Corporal Michael Pritchard, 22, from Eastbourne, East Sussex, was killed by a gunshot wound to the ribcage which is believed to have been fired from a remote observation post, known as a sangar, by Lance Corporal Malcolm Graham, of The Royal Scots Borderers, 1st Battalion. L/Cpl Graham thought he was shooting at insurgents planting explosives in the road, the hearing at Eastbourne Town Hall was told. L/Cpl Pritchard, who was on secondment with 4th Battalion The Rifles, was deployed to the observation post N30 on December 20, 2009, to watch a blind spot on an access road, Route 611, in the Sangin area of central Helmand Province. He was posted there to make sure Taliban insurgents did not dig improvised explosive devices (IEDs) into the road, the hearing was told. L/Cpl Graham, the man thought to have shot him, said that all of his sniper training had taken place in daylight and he had never used a thermal imaging sight at night. He told the court he was in bed on December 20 when he was told there were insurgents planting IEDs and that he would receive a briefing when he got to the remote sangar. On arrival he asked section commander Corporal Jonathan Dolton what was happening and he was told two men were planting bombs the road 700m away, the hearing heard. Sniper: Lance Corporal Malcolm Graham said he was told Taliban insurgents were digging in the road next to L/Cpl Pritchard's position . He was also told escalation drills had been carried out and sentries had fired warning shots with a machine gun. L/Cpl Graham said: 'He (Cpl Dolton) told me there was an observation post in the area and that I had been brought in for accurate fire.' L/Cpl Graham said he was never given an exact location for N30 - the post where L/Cpl Pritchard was on watch - and asked Cpl Dolton for more information. He was told it was on the right hand side of the road from where the suspected insurgents were digging but that the targets could not see the observation post from where they were. Cpl Dolton told the inquest that if he had realised his men were shooting at British soldiers they would have ceased firing immediately. He said poor radio communication meant he never received any messages to say shots were being fired close to the observation post where L/Cpl Pritchard was fatally wounded. Cpl Dolton said that he was told by soldiers when he arrived at the remote sangar that they thought they had spotted insurgents in the road. He looked at the road through a viper thermal imaging sight and made out two human figures, the inquest heard. He said Lance Corporal Craig Knight told him the operations room had given them permission to fire warning shots at the two heat sources. Cpl Dolton said he reminded everyone that N30 was being manned to the right side of the road. But the inquest has heard that all the soldiers in the remote sangar said they were not aware there was an observation post in the area where shots were being fired. Cpl Dolton told the court he did not believe the heat sources were coming from the post because white light was being used, which goes against military tactics. Treacherous: British Warthog fighting vehicles on Route 611, the road through Helmand Province where L/Cpl Pritchard was on the lookout for Taliban fighters trying to plant IEDs . He said he could see the outline of a body, and that the people appeared to be in the road rather than on the roof of a compound. He said: 'We were all in agreement that there were insurgents laying or arming an IED in the road.' Cpl Dolton said getting information to the operations room was difficult because the Bowman communications system and their personal radios had started working intermittently. He said he tried to contact the soldiers manning N30 to let them know there were suspected insurgents in their area but he could not get through. The inquest was told that the operations room told Cpl Dolton there were no soldiers in the road. Cpl Dolton said: 'Following all the suspicious activity I asked the ops room for permission to follow the escalation procedure, meaning moving from warning shots to lethal.' The corporal got out his map and ranged the sniper into the target which was 750m to 800m away, the inquest heard. Lethal: A British Royal Marine Commando sniper fires a .338 caliber high power rifle during training . He said as far as he knew they had permission to shoot across the restricted firing line. Cpl Dolton said at no point was he told to cease firing at the targets. He said: 'One word, ""They have come a bit close to me"". That would have ended everything.' East Sussex Coroner Alan Craze said: 'That was sent.' The corporal replied: 'But it was not received, Sir.' Cpl Dolton said the first message he received over his personal radio was: 'Check fire. Man down.' He said: 'We all immediately began thinking the worst, that fire from our location had hit one of our men. 'L/Cpl Knight and Malc went quiet. They were in shock, as was I. 'I was happy that we had followed the correct procedure and escalation drills during the incident. I did not hear or receive a contact report from anyone saying they were being shot at.' He added that if he had received one message which put any doubt in his mind it would have overruled everything they were doing and they would have stopped firing.","Lance Corporal Michael Pritchard, 22, was gunned down after he was mistaken for a Taliban insurgent .

A boy aged five had his eyeballs gouged out by his own mother in what officials believe to be a drug-fuelled ritual - it has been alleged. Police arrested the mother and a number of her relatives on Thursday after police were called to a house in Nezahualcoyotl, Mexico. A passing police car was flagged down on the street by someone who reported the incident and when officers entered the home they found the mother in shock with the boy in her arms. Scroll down for video... Shocking: Medical personnel transport the young boy to the hospital after he had his eyes gouged out . The boy's mother has been arrested. It is believed she was under the influence of an unspecified drug . 'Once the woman allowed local police to check the boy, they were astonished to see the boy had no eyeballs,' the government said in a statement. Mexico state prosecutor Isaac Acevedo told local media that a total of eight people had been detained and that investigators believed the mother herself gouged the boy's eyes out with her fingers. The boy's father was apparently not in the home at the time. The crime appeared to have been part of a ritual, but was not apparently related to the Santa Muerte or Saint Death cult, some of whose followers were recently charged with the sacrificial killings of two 10-year-old boys and a 55-year-old woman in northern Sonora state, he said. Nezahualcoyltl spokesman Fernando Chavez told how the boy's aunt and uncle were also apparently at the house when the adults began using some unspecified drug. Chavez said one witness told police she had passed out under the influence of drugs and when she regained consciousness, the boy's eyes were gone. The adults have not yet been charged in the case, but are being held pending investigation. Two children and a 17-year-old were also found at the residence. Police officers seal a house after the arrest of several people who had been participating in a religious ritual in Nezahualcoyotl, near Mexico City yesterday . The adults have not yet been charged in the case, but are being held pending a police investigation . In March, authorities in Sonora state arrested eight people for allegedly sacrificing the two boys and adult woman as offerings to Saint Death, an idol usually depicted as a robed skeleton. Followers of the cult include criminals and drug traffickers.While statues of Saint Death are common in many poor Mexican neighborhoods, Chavez said no altar or statue of the figure was found in the Nezahualcoyotl home.Mexico's worst case of ritual sacrifice came with the notorious 'narco-satanicos' killings of the 1980s. Fifteen bodies, many of them with signs of ritual sacrifice, were unearthed at a ranch outside the border city of Matamoros, across from Brownsville, Texas.","Police were flagged down by a concerned member of the public in Nezahualcoyotl, Mexico .

He’s accused of being involved in the deaths of hundreds of wounded men and women in the Balkan War. But Milan Sarcevic has been allowed to stay in Britain because throwing him out would violate his human rights. Suspected war criminal Sarcevic was told by the Home Office that he must leave last year. But a judge overturned the decision, and ruled his right to a ‘family life’ under Article 8 of the Human Rights Act means he can stay in Britain. Sarcevic, a Serbian, is accused of taking part in the 1991 Vukovar massacre, one of the worst atrocities of the Balkans war, when up to 300 wounded Croats were beaten, executed and buried in a mass grave. The 60-year-old first came to Britain more than a decade ago and, when refused asylum, returned to Croatia in September 2002. But just eight months later he was allowed back into Britain to put in another asylum claim. At the time the system was in chaos, and his case was neglected for nearly eight years, during which time he and his family settled in the UK. When the Daily Mail tracked him down to the council flat where he lives with his wife and their daughter and granddaughter, he praised human rights laws for allowing his family to remain here. He had just spent the day volunteering at a polling station during the local government elections. The smiling former soldier said: ‘I truly have no blood on my hands. 'I was a conscripted soldier for many years but I never killed or targeted innocent civilians. ‘I am just happy that the Human Rights Act has allowed me to stay in this country. 'It is a good thing that the Act has allowed me to stay. It has changed my life. 'Now all I am waiting for is the Home Office to give me clearance so I can find some work.' ‘I know something of being able to do . accounts ... but I will do any work. Perhaps I will apply to be a . traffic warden, or a porter or a hotel cleaner. I want to make this . country my home now. Sarcevic lives with his 56-year-old . wife Nada in a Corporation of London flat on a small council estate off . Old Kent Road in South-East London. The . flat is also home to his 28-year-old daughter Srdjana and her . nine-year-old daughter. It is understood that he and his family have . lived on benefits since arriving here nine years ago because he has not . been allowed to work. Safety: The polling station in Galleywall Road, Bermondsey where alleged war criminal Milan Sarcevic volunteered . Sarcevic’s 35-year-old son Alexander – and his partner – have also been granted leave to stay in the country but do not live with him. When he was first questioned by immigration officials he admitted being a fighter with a Serb military unit in Croatia during the country’s war for independence. Serbian forces – under the command of Slobodan Milošević – took the city of Vukovar in November 1991 from Croatian defenders. Around 300 wounded Croats were taken from a hospital to a pig farm at Ovčara and summarily executed. Sarcevic . told officials he expected to be named as a suspect ‘because I was . there at the place where they brought the people who lost their lives’. And . he told officials he expected to be included on a list of war criminals . linked to the massacre, despite protesting that he had tried to rescue . the victims and as a result narrowly avoided being killed by senior . officers. Mass grave: Victims of the Vukovar massacre are unearthed in 1998 . Leader: Serbian forces, under the command of Slobodan Milo¿evi¿ who died in 2006, took the city of Vukovar in 1991 from Croatian defenders . The Home Office refused his application in February last year and accused him of taking a ‘direct role in massacre of the Croatian prisoners’. Before an immigration appeal judge he ditched his earlier story and claimed he did not know about the massacre until ten years later and that he ‘didn’t fire his gun’ during the battle for Vukovar. The judge ruled evidence of his involvement was ‘not conclusive’ and did not warrant breaching his family rights under Article 8, saying there was evidence of his ‘strong family life’. The judge added: ‘At best, there is a possibility that the appellant may have participated but that is not enough  to . . . permit the serious interference that would result in the appellant being removed to his family life and that of those around him.’ Sarcevic’s wife has also been given the right to stay in Britain, because she has depression and is seen as a ‘suicide risk’ if returned to Croatia. Tory MP Andrew Percy said: ‘It’s totally wrong that this man has had the opportunity to have two goes at the asylum system. 'It’s inexplicable. It’s nonsense to use this Article 8 right to family life. He can easily go back to Serbia and enjoy a family life there.’ Sarcevic is only the latest alleged  war criminal to be given sanctuary in Britain. Last year, a former henchman of Robert Mugabe was given refuge in the UK. Phillip Machemedze tortured opponents of the regime. He was given the right to stay here in case he faces ill treatment if returned to Zimbabwe. A UK Border Agency spokesman said: ‘Too often weak Article 8 claims have been used to dodge deportation and by this summer the Government will have in place new immigration rules which will help end this abuse. ‘Toughening the rules will make it clear where the public interest in removal should outweigh the migrants’ right to family life, helping us to remove the people who should be removed.’ Confronted: Milan Sarcevic denies he has blood on his hands .","Milan Sarcevic is accused of taking part in the 1991 .

"By . Jill Reilly . PUBLISHED: . 11:16 EST, 31 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:33 EST, 31 May 2012 . Investigation: Shafilea Ahmed 17, went missing from home in Cheshire, in 2003. Her decomposed remains were found six months later in Cumbria . Shafilea Ahmed's sister has told a court she lied to police investigating the teenager's disappearance because she was 'covering up for her parents.' Alesha Ahmed was continuing her evidence at Chester Crown Court where parents, Iftikhar, 52, and Farzana, 49, deny murdering 17-year-old Shafilea. The teenager vanished in September 2003 and her decomposed remains were discovered in Cumbria in February 2004. It was not until last year that Ms Ahmed provided the 'final piece of the puzzle' about Shafilea’s death, the prosecution say, when she disclosed that she witnessed her parents killing Shafilea at the family home in Liverpool Road, Warrington. Today, the jury were read passages of Ms Ahmed’s first police interview following Shafilea’s disappearance. The witness, who was aged 15 at the time, told officers that she woke up at 7am that morning and saw that Shafilea was gone and that her bag was also missing. She went on in the interviews to say she did not think her parents had caused any harm to her sister. Cross-examined about the interview, Tom Bayliss QC, defending Mr Ahmed, said: 'You were telling the truth, weren’t you?' Ms Ahmed, now aged 23, replied: 'No, I was 15-years-old and I was scared of my parents and had just witnessed a murder actually.' The barrister went on: 'Nobody would expect to see (Shafilea) back if they had seen a murder happen.But it didn’t happen did it?' Ms Ahmed said: 'It did happen and we all saw it.' Arriving at courtr: Shafilea's mother Farzana Ahmed, left, and Iftikhar Ahmed, right, deny murder . Mr Bayliss told the court that police asked Ms Ahmed outright if she knew where her sister was. He added: 'The answer to that, according to you, was that Shafilea is dead.' The witness replied: 'But was I not telling the truth, I was covering up for my parents.' Questioned about why Ms Ahmed suggested to police that Shafilea may have been with a male friend, the barrister said: 'The wicked and cruellest thing you could do in those circumstances, knowing someone is dead, is to lay suspicion on a wholly innocent individual.' Ms Ahmed responded: 'I didn’t put suspicion on someone else and I think it is wicked and cruel you are saying it yourself.' Family home: The Ahmeds lived in this house in Warrington, Cheshire . Last week, Alesha described how her parents pushed Shafilea onto the settee in their house and she heard her mother say 'Just finish it here' as they forced a plastic bag into the teenager’s mouth and suffocated her in front of their other children. The couple allegedly murdered their 'Westernised' daughter because they believed her conduct was bringing shame on the family, the prosecution say. Ms Ahmed made the claim about Shafilea’s murder when she was in custody after being arrested for organising a robbery at the Ahmed home in August last year. Mr Bayliss accused her of lying about the robbery and failing to tell the police who her accomplices were. He said she was expecting the jury to believe what she was telling them about her parents, but that 'time and time again' she had been telling lies. She replied: 'I think it’s actually ridiculous that I am on the stand and that my parents don’t have the guts to say what they have done. 'They are putting me through all this. I have been very kind to them.' On . trial: Iftikhar Ahmed, left, and Farzana Ahmed, right, are said to have . killed their 17-year-old daughter because she refused to obey them . 'I have been fair in everything I have said,' Ms Ahmed said, adding she told the police that the murder was not about Shafilea being forced into an arranged marriage. 'I have not told a lie.I have said that I have come here to be fair. 'I think it’s out of order that I am being put through this because they can’t tell the truth themselves,' she said. The court heard how in the days leading up to the robbery in August 2010 Ms Ahmed - a full time student - was 'flush' with money and that £6,500 was paid into one of her bank accounts, on top of cash including student loans being paid into another account. Tragic: Shafilea had been a keen student at her school in Warrington, Cheshire, and enjoyed trips to shopping centres and wearing Western clothes . The jury was told how she paid £1,500 for a Dolce and Gabbana bag as well as 'renting' a grey BMW for £400 a week. She claimed she had saved the money up through a job working at a petrol station, getting paid for doing girls’ hair extensions, and from saving on rent when she moved in with her boyfriend. The court was then told that Ms Ahmed was forced to 'pay off' the people who were threatening the robbery with a total of £3,700 in an attempt to stop it from happening. She said people came to her home, stopped her on her way to work and that once she was driven to Birmingham to draw out money for these 'mysterious men'. She said: 'I was putting people off to try and stop the robbery... basically I was being pressured. 'Where I was living, people were turning up there. I got myself into a mess and I was having to pay people off.' She told the court that she could not go into the reasons for the pressure and Mr Bayliss accused her of being 'evasive'. He said: 'You are avoiding naming your accomplices.' She replied: 'I don’t know who they are. If I knew who they were I would probably be able to help myself a lot more.' The court also heard that Ms Ahmed lied to police by telling them that £2,000 which had been paid out of one of her accounts had gone to charity. She said: 'It was a ridiculous lie. It should not have been told really.' Mr Bayliss said: 'It’s another ridiculous lie isn’t it?' She replied: 'It’s a ridiculous lie, yes.' And she admitted that she had still not told the police 'exactly why everything happened'.","Alesha Ahmed was continuing her evidence at Chester Crown Court where parents, Iftikhar, 52, and Farzana, 49, deny murdering 17-year-old Shafilea .

Her . friend Alisha Leggot told ITV News: 'I rang a few times, I left some . voicemails to tell her to contact us because we were worried about her.

Matthew, five, rushed over from the playground and said a ‘lady was . having a fit, she is on the ground. Can you come and help, Daddy?’ He said: ‘I ran over as quickly as I could and another woman who I had seen in the park earlier was already tending to her. ‘The girl was on the ground and her . breathing was very shallow. She was on the unconscious side of . semi-conscious and stirred a bit as we put her in the recovery . position.’ Mr Willis said his elder son had seen . the girl ‘walking normally’ through the park and when he looked across . again she was ‘on her knees and leaning forward as if she was trying to . get something out of her bag’. Emotions: Heartfelt messages at the scene included one from the Willis family, left, after John found the girl at the park . The boy then saw her fall forward on to her face. The girl had blood on one of her hands, Mr Willis said. Police arrived moments later and took . over the first aid until a paramedic arrived. He checked her over and . then said: ‘Clear the area – she’s been stabbed.’ Mr Willis added: ‘It was shocking at . the time and even more upsetting to find out the poor girl has not . survived.

It’s a very sad case and they are very traumatised.’ Appealing for witnesses, Mr Mann said: . ‘I can’t urge anyone enough, any detail no matter how small, please . come forward. Think about what Casey’s family are going through – . imagine if this was your daughter, sister, niece or friend.’ Grisly: An ambulance and two rapid response cars rushed to the park at around 1pm to help the girl . Mr Mann said they had yet to establish . a motive and that the attack was not believed to be a robbery. Acting . Chief Superintendent Peter Norman added: ‘This appears to be an . isolated, unprovoked and random incident.’ He said there had been only three . minor assaults in the park over the past 12 months and 39 reports of . ‘low-level anti-social behaviour’. Another girl of 13 said she and two . friends were screamed at by a woman in the park on Tuesday afternoon.

Face of innocence: Angel Mauro Cortez Nava was shot down and killed as he was cradled in his father's arms . A 14-month-old toddler has been gunned down outside his parent's house after his father was targeted for wearing purple clothing. Angel Mauro Cortez Nava was the innocent victim of a gang-related feud on Monday night in the Watts area of Los Angeles when he was murdered as Mauro Cortez, 24, cradled him on the pavement. Mr Cortez was wearing a purple top - a colour associated with one of two gangs that have been involved in a long-running and deadly feud. Neighbours say Mr Cortez has nothing to do with gang crime. Police are now searching for the killer who was a hoodie-wearing teenager and fired several shots as he rode by, injuring Mr Cortez. Mauro Jr was shot in the stomach and . rushed to hospital but died following surgery while his father was . struck in the shoulder and released yesterday. Police have not released a motive but neighbours and relatives all believe it could be a gang feud. Cortez, . who is from Mexico, told the LA Times through an interpreter that he . was devastated and his son was everything to him. He asked for help from . the public but added that he is scared. Marcus Williams, who lives nearby, . said: 'I have seen plenty of people pass away here. For a child to go, . this has to stop immediately.

Tim Leiweke, president of the group that owns the Kings, said the team was offering the reward 'to make sure everyone knows this is unacceptable in our city.' Cortez was wearing a purple shirt when the shooting took place, a colour some associate with the Barrio Grape Street gang, the Times said. Grape Street is one block west of Hickory. Cortez is an immigrant from Jalisco, Mexico, who did odd jobs, friends and relatives told the Times. When he showed up three years ago, the Cervantes family took him in, matriarch Sara Cervantes said. Cortez had nothing to do with any gang, neighbours said. He got married and in 2011, Angel was born. 'He . was always here playing with the baby. The baby was his life,' said . Maria Trujillo, another member of the family. 'With these shootings . going on, you don't feel safe in your own front yard,' she added. 'There . was a shooting around over there on the corner a block away; one on .

It happened at the height of the rioting which swept the country last August. The driving was part of a 'deliberate and co-ordinated' attack involving three vehicles, where the first car drew the victims into the road and thus into the path of the two following, the court heard. Yesterday eight men went on trial at Birmingham Crown Court, each charged with three counts of murder.

And jurors were also told that occupants of the Mazda were allegedly heard shouting 'Pakis, Pakis, we're coming for you,' followed by: ‘Pakis we are going to come back and shoot you,' shortly before the incident. Prosecutor Timothy . Spencer QC had earlier warned the nine women and three men of the jury . to ‘prepare to be shocked’ by the ‘shocking’ footage. As it the moment of impact was . replayed on flatscreens around the courtroom, some in the public gallery . gasped in horror, while others became embroiled in an angry exchange . which led to the case being temporarily halted. Eight men today went on trial at Birmingham Crown Court, each charged with three counts of murder. The jury watched as CCTV showed a . black Audi A3 Quattro slow down as it passed a group of men standing on . the pavement - drawing them off the pavement into the road. Yards behind, the Mazda 6 and a Ford Fiesta were seen pulling up alongside each other. As the Audi slowed, the driver of the . Mazda gestured with his arm outside the window to the Fiesta now . alongside in Dudley Rd, Winson Green. The two cars drove forward, with the . Mazda veering straight in to the group of men. Its bonnet sprung up on . impact as the victims were flung over the top of the car, which was . found burnt out around 90 minutes later. After the clip had finished, Mr . Spencer told the jury the Mazda driver’s gesture was ‘a signal, . particularly to the Fiesta, to go (forward).' He added: ‘The driving you have just seen was not chance. It was not accidental. ‘It was deliberate and co-ordinated. It was the modern day equivalent of a chariot charge. And it was deadly.’ He said the three victims were ‘killed in shocking circumstances.' Mr Justice Flaux cleared the court after a heated argument broke out in the public gallery . The court heard all eight defendants were allegedly in the three cars at the time of the incident. Ryan Goodwin, 21, Shaun Flynn, 26, . Juan Ruiz-Gaviria, 31, Joshua Donald, 27, Everton Graham, 30, Adam King, . 24, Ian Beckford, 30, and Aaron Parkins, 18, all from the Birmingham . area, were surrounded by seven dock officers as the trial began. Beckford was allegedly driving Graham . in the Mazda, Donald was said to be carrying Parkins in the Fiesta, . while King was allegedly driving the remaining three defendants in the . Audi. Mr Spencer told the jury the killings . unfolded amid high tension in an area of Birmingham where ‘a high level . of the population are of Asian origin, and almost everyone who has a . faith is of the Muslim faith.’ He said the incident took place . during the faith’s Ramadan period of fasting, in a three-day period . where there was a ‘breakdown of order across the country’, including . Birmingham. One of the important factors in that . breakdown was widespread looting of businesses, with a string of . businesses targeted in the Winson Green area. Mr Spencer said that hours before the . car ploughed in to the men, tensions were increasing in the area, . tensions which had been ‘ratcheted up’ by ‘gangs of youths driving . around in vehicles who were looking for places to raid and, on the other . hand, crowds or gangs from the community – essentially Asian males out . on the street, many armed with sticks, bats and bricks.’ He added: ‘All of the men in the dock . must have been aware of that backdrop. That backdrop was the reality in . this area of Birmingham.’ Mr Spencer said one car seen with . three balaclava-clad men in the back at the Jet petrol station close to . where the three victims were killed was likely carrying out ‘a form of . reconnaissance…looking for somewhere  to target later.’ The court was told that the night . before the murders, Tariq Jahan – the father of victim Haroon Jahan – . witnessed a convoy of three cars carrying mainly black passengers who . were wearing scarves or balaclavas. Mr Jahan told police the cars parked . in a street behind the Jet garage. Up to 15 men got out and walked . towards the petrol station, moments before it came under attack from a . mob of looters who armed themselves with plastic milk crates stacked on . the forecourt. Tariq Jahan pictured the morning after his son Haroon Jahan was killed after being struck by a car . Footage of the attack was yesterday . played to the jury and showed masked men smashing through the petrol . station windows with the crates before one leapt inside to steal money . from the till. They were beaten back by a garage worker armed with a . metal pole. Mr Spencer said that the following . day, the local community ‘got together and decided they had to protect . their businesses’ when nightfall arrived, in order to ‘prevent further . looting’. Up to 100 Asian men had gathered on the streets armed with sticks, bats and batons from around 9.30pm on the evening of August 9. The court was shown footage of a rock being thrown at a Saab belonging to Beckford's brother, John, has he turned into Dudley Road. The court was told there was then a flurry of calls between the two brothers and their associates. Within minutes, the Mazda, Audi and Fiesta were on the scene. The court heard Beckford later claimed: 'We all went down there to back him (brother John) up'. Mr Spencer said 'perfectly legitimate questions' could be asked about whether the conduct of some of the Asians was lawful. But he added: 'We do suggest that there was a genuine desire amongst many if not all of them to protect their businesses and livelihoods. ‘They lived in the area, they depended on the businesses in the area to survive. ‘The prosecution are here to put before you what we say was murderous conduct. ‘Whatever one's view about the actions of both sides of the divide, the prosecution say that the driving, the heart of the case, the driving which culminated in three deaths was out of any sensible proportion to anything that had gone on before and that conduct, that driving was murder and nothing less.’ The trial continues.","Jurors see CCTV of moment Shazad Ali, 30, Abdul Musavir, 31, and Haroon Jahan, 20, were hit by car .

"By . Lee Moran . PUBLISHED: . 07:03 EST, 16 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:52 EST, 16 April 2012 . The King of Spain has come under fire for hunting elephants in Botswana as his country is being sucked back into the eurozone's financial crisis and one in two youngsters are jobless. Spanish media have slammed Juan Carlos for the reported £27,000 cost of the trip - and have published angry editorials alongside pictures of a previous 'Big Game' hunting expedition. They are also angry at a 'lack of transparency' from the Royal Household, three months after it promised to disclose its income following a corruption probe linked to his son-in-law. It comes as fears rise that Spain will become the latest member of the eurozone to beg for a financial bailout - as its 10-year yield's creep perilously close to the 7 per cent level which saw Ireland, Portugal and Greece receiving a handout. Under fire: Spanish King Juan Carlos (right), pictured during a previous elephant hunting trip in Africa, has come in for criticism . The royal holiday last week would have remained secret if the king had not tripped on a step, fractured his hip and had to be flown back urgently to Madrid to undergo hip replacement surgery on Saturday morning. Juan Carlos called on Spanish leaders in his annual Christmas message to set a good example. More recently, he said there were times when he could not sleep because of concern about Spain's youth unemployment problem. Anger: Juan Carlos (left, on a previous trip) has been slammed for his upper-class pursuit as his country goes through the economic doldrums . Last week he cancelled his regular . weekly meeting with Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy because he had already . left for Botswana, several newspapers said. Spain's cost of borrowing on the international debt markets rose sharply again today - sparking fears it will become the latest member of the eurozone to seek a financial bailout. The yield - the interest rate Spain would have to pay to raise money on the debt markets - on the country's 10-year government bonds jumped to 6.10 per cent on the secondary market. It is the highest since the country's new conservative government under Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy took office in December. And it is close to the 7 per cent level that forced Greece, Portugal and Ireland to ask for bailouts. Although the administration has implemented a barrage of labour and financial reforms, investors remain worried about Spain on several fronts. They say the country's banks are weighed down by a mountain of bad loans from the collapse of the property market in 2008. There are also worries that many of Spain's 17 semi-autonomous regional governments have overspent wildly, and that the nation is expected to enter its second recession in three years this quarter. Fears are also compounded by the unemployment rate of 23 per cent, rising up to almost 50 per cent for those aged under 30. After the bailing out Greece, Portugal and Ireland, the eurozone has agreed to increase the size of its financial firewall to help out its members should they fail to raise money from the markets. But Spain's €1.1trillion economy is twice the size of the previous three bailout victims put together. Analysts say the eurozone's €800billion is not large enough to deal with the potential threats coming from Spain and Italy. El Mundo newspaper said in an editorial: 'It was an irresponsible trip, taken at the worst possible moment. 'The . image of a monarch hunting elephants in Africa at a time when the . economic crisis in our country creates so many problems for the Spanish . people is a very poor example.' Most Spanish dailies and TV channels yesterday showed a picture of the king in front of a dead elephant, taken on a similar trip to Botswana in 2006. The picture drew many internet and Twitter comments, some linking it to a Russian hunting trip in 2006 when the king was reported to have killed a bear which had been made drunk. News of the King's latest trip came at a time when Spain's political leaders face growing social anger. Support for Rajoy fell sharply this month after his government announced deep spending cuts and health and education reforms to fight the sovereign debt crisis, an opinion poll showed yesterday. ABC newspaper said it was Juan Carlos's 'bitterest year' since he came to the throne and became head of state shortly after the death in 1975 of dictator Francisco Franco. The King, who oversaw the country's tense transition to democracy, won respect from many Spaniards in 1981 when he publicly condemned an attempted coup. He has remained very popular, though a poll in October showed that the Spanish people's trust in the royal family was declining. The monarchy was also criticised in December when Inaki Urdangarin, the husband of the King's youngest daughter Cristina, was charged in a fraud and embezzlement case. A separate accident also drew media attention to the royal family on Monday, when Felipe Juan Froilan, the 13-year-old son of the king's eldest daughter Infanta Elena, accidentally shot himself in the foot with a shotgun during target practice outside a family home north of Madrid. The incident reminded older Spaniards of a more serious royal shooting accident in 1956 when King Juan Carlos's 14-year-old brother, Alfonso, died at the royal family's home. Unlucky: The Spanish King was on trip hunting elephants in Botswana when he fell after returning to his bedroom in a lodge . King Juan Carlos has had an emergency hip replacement after falling during a hunting trip . The palace said at the time that . Alfonso was killed by a bullet in the head when a revolver he was . cleaning went off accidentally. But historians have questioned the . official version of events. The . King, a keen sailor, has had at least five hunting and skiing accidents . in the past, some requiring surgery. He also had a lung operation in . 2010 and knee and foot surgery in 2011. Rajoy, who visited the king yesterday,  said he would resume his duties gradually and would attend their weekly meeting next Friday. He said: 'I saw him being very upbeat. He will recover very soon and resume his usual duties.' Physicians caring for the king of Spain say he is likely to be recuperating for the next six weeks, as he delegates his duties as head of state to his son, Prince Felipe, while he recuperates. The accident occurred early on Friday while the king was on safari in the Okavango area of Botswana. He was immediately flown home by private jet. Angel Villamor, a spokesman for the medical team caring for him, said he is recovering well.","Spain is being sucked back into eurozone's financial crisis .

Violence: An armed mob 'lured' police on to the streets by firebombing a pub so they could attack them during last summer's riots, a court has heard .

Police had been dispatched to deal . with reports of a fire at the Barton Arms pub in the Newtown area of the . city on August 9 last year.

"By . Emma Reynolds . UPDATED: . 11:24 EST, 19 December 2011 . Families have endured a drop in their disposable income for the fifth year running, with an average of £552 lost in the past 12 months, it was revealed today. In a stark reminder of how bad things have got for British households, one in ten told a survey by the Bank of England they had struggled to pay rent and bills this year. More than half said their wages had failed to keep pace with inflation, as the cost of living soared and VAT reached 20 per cent. Panic: One in ten households struggled to keep up bill payments this year as their wages failed to keep pace with inflation . The number of bill-payers who said they fell behind on payments was 7.5 per cent - almost double the 4.1 per cent it stood at a year ago. 'The environment facing households remains challenging,' concluded the NMG consulting survey for the bank's quarterly bulletin. A third of workers said they were more uncertain of their future salary than they had been 12 months earlier. The report said that incomes had fallen and the outlook for was relatively uncertain. Half of those surveyed admitted to taking steps such as increasing their hours or looking for a new job to help them cope with the financial squeeze. This would explain why, despite falling employment levels, the total number of workforce jobs has increased by 150,000. Squeezed: The average household's monthly disposable income plummeted by £46 to £720 . Crunched: The economy has yet to be revitalised by low interest rates, with more than 15 per cent put off spending by concerns over credit . Many put the problems down to Government austerity measures, and their outlook for the future was gloomy as well, with more than two-thirds expecting more pain to come. The report added: 'Some households reported that the fiscal consolidation was affecting them, mainly through lower income and higher taxes, and that they were responding, particularly by trying to increase their labour supply through finding a new job or working longer hours.' With confidence at a low and money tight, consumer demand is also falling - leading to fears of another recession. Interest rates remain at a low of 0.5 per cent, but Britain is on a knife-edge, with home-owners on variable interest rate mortgages admitting they would struggle if these rose by even one percentage point. Renters were worst affected, with an average disposable income of £450 per month, where the average across all households was £720. Debt-ridden: Credit percentage balances remain at a shocking low, especially for renters . Trying times: Bill-payers are finding it tough to keep up with their commitments . The average pre-tax income per household was just over £2,850. The Bank of England said credit conditions 'remained tight' and as many as a tenth of respondents said they had been forced to turn to family and friends to borrow money. It said: 'Over the past year, the recovery in the . UK economy appears to have slowed. That weakness in the UK demand has . been driven by falling consumption, reflecting the challenging . environment facing households. 'Some households were finding that they could not save as much due to lower income or the higher cost of essentials,' added the report. The number of households who saved nothing at all had increased from last year to two-fifths, and 14 per cent said they had dipped in to savings and other assets to help keep up with bills and repayments. The average amount of money saved was just £176 per month.","Bank of England survey paints gloomy picture .

Caine had only hoped to have some fun with a few customers when he turned his father's Los Angeles auto parts store into a makeshift arcade out of old discarded boxes. Scroll down for video .

Welcoming: Molly Atkinson, the owner of Pins and Needles in Los Angeles, is behind the generous gift .

"By . Amy Oliver . UPDATED: . 01:36 EST, 1 May 2012 . For five years she had been an ordinary single mother, bringing up her young son in a quiet suburb of an American city. But today justice finally caught up with Rasema Handanovic as she was jailed for five-and-a-half years for the war crimes she committed two decades ago at the height of the Bosnian conflict. The 39-year-old, who is a US citizen, admitted killing six Bosnian Croats during an attack on the southern village of Trusina in April, 1993. Jailed: After being extradited from the US Rasema Handanovic was jailed for five-and-a-half years today . Killing squad: This picture of Rasema Handanovic was taken at the time of the Bosnian conflict . The court had heard how she was a member . of the Bosnian army’s feared special unit, the Zulfikar, which killed . with impunity during the conflict. Handanovic had shot a woman and an elderly couple dead. She was also accused of joining a firing-squad execution of unarmed Croatian soldiers and civilians on the same day. A total of 18 Croat civilians and four prisoners of war, were killed during the attack on April 16 1993. Judge Jasmina Kosovic,sitting in Sarajevo,  said Handanovic had been the victim of a wartime rape before committing the Trusina crimes and had lost several family members in the conflict. Handanovic was sentenced to . five-and-a-half years in prison, after she struck a plea bargain and . agreed to testify against six other members of the Zulfikar special unit . of the Bosnian army which carried out the attack. Awaiting her fate: Handanovic at Sarajevo airport in December after being extradited to the US . Protectors: U.S. soldiers, members of the NATO led peacekeeping force prepare to go on patrol in Bosnia . Civil . war among Bosnia's three main groups - Muslims, Serbs and Croats - . broke out in 1992 and lasted until 1995, killing 260,000 people and . driving 1.8 million from their homes. Muslims . and Croats were allied against the Serbs at the start of the war, but . they became enemies when Croat forces sought to capture territory held . by the Bosnian army. War crimes trials have been occurring since the end of the war. The . worst atrocity was Bosnian Serbs' slaughter of 7,500 Muslims in . Srebrenica in July 1995. The killings galvanised international will to . end the war. The . testimony from combatants differs somewhat, but the underlying . narrative, included in the prosecution's file on Handanovic, is . consistent. According . to it, Handanovic's unit rounded up a group of Croat residents and, . along with three captured soldiers from the Croatian military, bound and . shot them, the combatants said. As . they lay dying, she 'shot into the heads of two or three (Croat) soldiers who were lying on the ground and showing signs of life,' a . combatant testified. 'She might have shot more of them, but I cannot remember now.' 'The court has taken into account that . Handanovic admitted the crimes, was willing to provide all information . and evidence related to the attack and the fact that she expressed . remorse to the relatives of the victims,' Kosovic told the court. Handanovic, whose parents live in the US, is the first woman to be jailed for slaughtering civilians during the Bosnian War. She was arrested in Portland, Oregon, . at the home she shared with her son, last year at the request . of the Bosnia and Herzegovia government. They also arrested her accomplice Edin Dzeko, 39, in Everett, Washington. Dzeko allegedly threw a man into the . yard of a house, then shot and killed him. When the dead man's wife . would not stop grieving, Dzeko allegedly shot her in the head and killed . her. At the time of Handanovic's arrest, neighbours spoke of their disbelief at the allegations. Speaking to katu.com, neighbour Ella Wilvorn said the arrest had been a complete surprise. 'That totally dumbfounds me,' she said. 'I can't even imagine it.' Another, who did not give her name, described the Bosnian Muslim as 'direct' but not violent and 'very calm'. Handanovic became a U.S. citizen in 2006 having come to America in 2001. She had lived in Portland since 2003. The killings occurred during the 1993-94 war between Bosnian Muslims and Croats. After a truce was brokered a Bosnian state war crimes court was set up in 2005 to try the thousands of war crimes suspects.

Adrian Cartwright, 46, had hired the taxi to take his family out for dinner at an Indian restaurant near Oldham, Greater Manchester. But before they could make the five-minute journey the driver, in his 20s, spotted the bottle of white wine and promptly refused to take them. The family was turfed out onto the pavement and he drove off. Ban: A Muslim taxi driver refused to take a family because they had an unopened bottle of white wine . On his Facebook page a furious Mr Cartwright wrote: 'We all got inside the car and the driver said: ""Is that alcohol?’""When I said ‘yes’ he replied: ‘I am sorry but I can’t allow it in my cab – it’s against my religion’. 'I knew it wasn’t worth arguing so we had to get out.' He added: 'The meal I had that evening was a Halal meal, whose methods I don’t agree with, but tolerate out of respect. 'I expect anyone offering a public service to do the same, and will be contacting the licensing department to suggest that the driver is politely asked to do so, or hand his badge back.' He also complained to the driver's employer Borough Taxis, who have around 70 Muslim drivers, and within half an hour he was sacked. Sacked: The man, in his 20s, was sacked as a cab driver within 30 minutes for his attitude (file picture) The company's former chairman, Fazal Rahim, who has also driven for them for almost a quarter of a century, said the driver's attitude was unprofessional. 'I am a practising Muslim, like a lot of the drivers. This was not a decision based on race or religion, however, but about being a professional taxi driver,' Mr Rahim said. 'As taxi drivers, we cannot be moral policemen. If I picked a customer up from a pub, should I ask him if he has been drinking? Of course not.

A total of 24 flights were forced to touch down at other UK destinations due to . the combination of poor visibility and runway repairs, a Gatwick . spokesman said. Engineers were carrying out planned maintenance work to the airport's main runway overnight, leaving just the second landing strip open. Shutdown: Gatwick Airport operators were forced to divert planes this morning due to poor visibility and runway repairs . The south-east of England was blanketed in fog this morning for the first time after days of hot weather. However, the sky is expected to clear later and temperatures could hit 25C in London and the south-east of England. Met Office forecaster Ruth Steele said: 'There is an area of quite extensive mist and fog which might be a bit slow to clear. 'By mid-day it should be clear and most places will be throughout the morning with some potential for showers later. 'There is still potential for temperatures between 22C and 24C. The centre of London expected to be the warmest and temperatures could hit 25C.' In the north-east, Newcastle will have a cloudy day and temperatures are expected to reach no higher than 14C, while in Manchester it will be 19C.

She then underwent four courses of chemotherapy to kill any remaining cancerous cells. But doctors warned her that she would likely to be left infertile and faced the heart-wrenching possibility of never having a family in the future. 'Fantastic': Clair Sudron, 32, has given birth to twins Bella and Scarlett just two years after she was told cancer treatment would leave her infertile . Yet just over a year later, the sales assistant discovered she was carrying twins. And seven weeks ago she gave birth to daughters Bella and Scarlett Herring, who were both given a clean bill of health. Miss Sudron, of Hartlepool, County Durham, discovered her lump early on, which resulted in medics being able to save her life. She is now encouraging others to go for a check-up if they have any doubts whatsoever. Miss Sudron, who lives with partner Steven Herring, said: 'I can’t really describe that moment when you are told you have cancer. 'The surgeon said to me he couldn’t believe I had breast cancer, I was young, didn’t smoke, wasn’t overweight and looked after myself.

Then in August last year, she realised that she was pregnant. She said: 'I had all of the symptoms of being pregnant but to be honest I thought it was the chemotherapy, it really messes all of your systems up. 'But I did a few tests and they were all positive.

Craig Shaw (pictured) admitted aggravated burglary in December and was jailed for eight-and-a-half years. A terrified father who killed a burglar by hitting him in the head with a meat cleaver was justified in his actions, a coroner ruled yesterday. Xiaopeng Wang had been bludgeoned with a wheel brace and his wife punched in the face as she cradled their two-year-old daughter after Steven Shaw and his brother Craig raided their home on a notorious estate in the middle of the night. A court heard the brothers subjected taxi driver Mr Wang and his family to a ‘harrowing and brutal attack’ lasting 15 minutes. The violence stopped only when Mr Wang, now 33, found a meat cleaver and hit Steven Shaw with it, causing a ‘sharp force trauma’ to his head. The burglar, 32, was pronounced dead after being taken to hospital. Police initially launched a murder inquiry and arrested four people, including Mr and Mrs Wang, now 32, and the victim’s brother. But no charges were ever brought against the couple after it was accepted Mr Wang had acted in self-defence. Police established the brothers had been targeting another person they thought lived at the address. When they realised they had the wrong victim, they decided to demand money from the Wangs anyway. Craig Shaw, 21, later admitted aggravated burglary and was jailed for eight-and-a-half years in December. Sentencing him at Nottingham Crown Court, Judge Michael Stokes said Mr Wang had been ‘fully entitled’ to pick up the cleaver to defend his family. The incident happened after Mr Wang was marched into the sitting room of his home on Nottingham’s Bestwood Estate to get cash for the burglars. He hit Shaw with the cleaver a number of times as the burglar attacked his wife and daughter. Recording a verdict of lawful killing at an inquest in Nottingham on Monday, coroner Mairin Casey said: ‘The defensive action taken by Mr Wang was proportionate and justified. ‘This was a harrowing and brutal experience for them, and I understand they are still traumatised.’ The inquest heard Steven Shaw punched Mrs Wang in the face and pulled her hair to force her to watch as her husband was assaulted. He was left with blood streaming into his eyes from a head wound. Steven Shaw and his brother Craig broke into a house in Morrell Bank (pictured) on the Bestwood Estate in Nottingham in March last year . Toxicology reports found traces of cocaine and alcohol in Shaw’s bloodstream. Miss Casey said: ‘Mr Wang and his family were subjected to extreme violence and trauma. In the course of the action, Mr Wang assaulted Steven Shaw, causing catastrophic injuries which led to his death.’ A spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service said: ‘When deciding whether to prosecute any offence, the CPS will consider the Code for Crown Prosecutors and any relevant guidance. The CPS has published guidelines concerning the reasonable use of force in cases where householders choose to defend themselves or their property. ‘In this case, these guidelines were applied and the CPS accepted that the householder had acted in self-defence, and that the correct course of action was to proceed with charges of aggravated burglary against the intruder and to take no further action against the householder.’ Residents in the street where the attack took place said police moved the Wangs to a secret location after the incident, telling their former neighbours: ‘You won’t be seeing them again.’ A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Police said yesterday the family remained ‘very traumatised’ and had since moved out of the region to make a fresh start.","Steven Shaw and his brother broke in and assaulted a taxi driver and his wife .

Locked up in her palace and spending her lonely days composing sad songs, the life story of Hawaii's first and last Queen is tragic. Liliuokalani, originally called name Lydia Kamakaeha, was the last Hawaiian sovereign to govern the islands, which were annexed by the United States in 1898. In 1862, Liliuokalani married John Owen Dominis, son of a Boston sea captain and himself an official in the Hawaiian government. Hawaiian royalty: Liliuokalani, original name Lydia Kamakaeha was the first and only reigning Hawaiian queen and the last Hawaiian sovereign to govern the islands, which were annexed by the United States in 1898 . 1870s royalty: In 1874 her brother David Kalakaua was chosen king, and in 1877, on the death of a second brother, W.P. Leleiohoku, she became Queen which is when she was known by her royal name, Liliuokalani . Their marriage was said to be an unhappy union and they were rumours of his infidelity. They lived with his widowed mother at Washington Place, today the official residence of Hawaii's Governor. In 1874 Liliuokalani's brother David Kalakaua was chosen king, but when he died in January 1891, Liliuokalani ascended the throne, becoming the first woman ever to occupy it. From then on she was known by her royal name, Queen Liliuokalani. Fortunately her experience as Princess Regent during King Kalakaua's nine-month world trip in 1881 and visit to the United States ,in 1890 had prepared her for her new role as Queen of Hawaii. Travelling: Her experience as Princess Regent during King Kalakaua's nine month journey around the world in 1881 and visit to the United States in 1890 had prepared her for her new role as Queen of Hawaii . Members of the native population persuaded the new queen to draft a new constitution in an attempt to restore native rights and powers. The move was resisted by the Committee on Annexation, which were a small group of businessmen and politicians who felt that annexation by the United States, the major importer of Hawaiian agricultural products, would be beneficial for the economy of Hawaii. On January 17, 1893, Queen Liliuokalani yielded her authority announcing it was to 'avoid any collision of armed forces, and perhaps the loss of life.' In 1895, a failed attempt by Hawaiian royalists to restore Queen Liliuokalani to power resulted in her arrest. She was forced to sign a document of abdication that relinquished all her future claims to the throne. She was then made to endure a humiliating public trial before a military tribunal in her former throne room. Queen Liliuokalani was convicted of having knowledge of a royalist plot, and was fined - she was sentenced to five years in prison and hard labor - although it was later reduced. Pose for the photo: Liliuokalani and Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson look thoughtful as they sit beside an open window, both with garlands of flowers around their necks . Instead she imprisoned in an upstairs bedroom of Iolani Palace and was denied any visitors other than one lady in waiting. Queen Liliuokalani spent her days reading, quilting, crochet-work, as well as composing music. She wrote approximately 165 songs, . including Ke Aloha O Ka Haku -- The Queen's Prayer, which was written . during her lonely imprisonment. Even after her release from Iolani . Palace, Queen Liliuokalani  remained under house arrest for five months at her . private home, Washington Place. It was still another eight months before all restrictions were lifted and she was allowed to move freely and in 1896, the Republic of Hawaii gave her a full pardon and restored her civil rights. On July 12, 1898, the Hawaiian islands were officially annexed by the United States. Retirement: Pictured here in 1917, after her reign ended, she withdrew from public life, enjoying a government pension, but was still well respected amongst the islanders . Queen Liliuokalani  lived in Washington Place until her death, aged 79, in 1917 due to complications from a stroke. She received a grand state funeral due to her status as a former head of state and her remains were placed in the Royal Mausoleum. Upon her death, Queen Liliuokalani   dictated in her will that all of her possessions and properties be sold. The funds raised went to the Queen Liliuokalani Children's Trust to help orphaned and indigent children and it is still in existence today. In 1993, 100 years after the overthrow, President Clinton signed a Congressional resolution in which the United States government formally apologized to the native Hawaiian people. Time: Today Hawaii is associated with idyllic beaches and is touted as an ideal holiday destination, but over 100 years ago, debate over its sovereignty was fierce .","Queen Liliuokalani, was the last Hawaiian sovereign to govern the islands, which were annexed by the United States in 1898 .

She admitted two offences of causing the teenage boy to engage in sex with her in her Jeep . A married woman had sex with a 15-year-old schoolboy in her car after enticing him by flashing flashing her breasts on the internet. Susan Millman, 47, used a webcam to try and tempt other teenage boys by promising them sex in video shows online. Millman, from Grimsby, whose husband runs a coach company, has now been jailed for 18 months after admitting two offences of causing the teenage boy to engage in sex with her in her Jeep. Grimsby Crown Court also banned her from working with children for life and ordered to sign on the Sex Offenders’ Register for 10 years. Photographs . of her appeared on a social networking site and were viewed by . teenagers. Police became aware when an adult was informed and the victim . was interviewed. Prosecuting . barrister James Byatt said Millman's initial contact with the youth was . on Facebook and was of a friendly nature prior to the two offences . between September and November 2010 and January and March 2011. He . said: 'She took a caring attitude and he confided in her. He felt he . could unburden himself and they had hugs. After rows with his mother he . felt he could go to confide in her. 'The nature of the communication changed and it became more sexual. She would comment on his good looks. 'There was a message for him on Facebook every day and texts of a sexual nature were sent. There were so many he asked her to stop it when he was at school.' Mr Byatt gave details of the first sexual encounter when she picked him up in her Jeep. On another occasion he climbed out of his bedroom window and again she picked him up in the Jeep in which they had intercourse. Detectives later discovered evidence on a webcam of her revealing herself and making provocative statements to one of the boys. Millman, 47, was sentenced at Grimsby Crown Court today to 18 months behind bars for sexually abusing the boy . She was arrested on May 24 and told police the contact had not been sexual - just kisses. She told police: 'He is chatty and bubbly, just like me.' Mr Byatt said the youth could not consent to having sex and she should have been aware of his emotional development. Having had contact with his mother in the past, she ought to have realised the boy’s vulnerable state, he said. In a statement on the impact on her son, his mother said there had been upset and he was 'more insecure'. The statement said the youth felt embarrassed and partly to blame. The defendant, dressed in a blouse and black trousers, sobbed throughout, with her head bowed. 'Female sex offenders should not be treated any differently. I am satisfied the court has recognised that.' For Millman, Simon Hirst said his client was adamant it was no fault of the teenager. He said: 'She feels she has let a large number of people down. Her life will never be the same. 'There was no element of planning. She behaved totally inappropriately and she takes total blame.' Mr Hirst said his client felt low self esteem at the time. Mr Millman went to work at 6.30am, until very late and she gained attention from the youth. Mr Hirst said: 'The relationship may have compensated for shortcomings in her marriage. She is remorseful and accepts full responsibility.' Judge David Tremberg told Millman: 'You were in a position of trust. You could not have failed to know that any form of amorous relationship, let alone full sexual relations with a boy 30 years your junior would have been wholly inappropriate and illegal. 'You were prepared to engage him on Facebook, by telephone and texts. At the time you were involved he should have been concentrating at school. He did not need to be distracted.' He added she had 'willingly' exposed herself to the boys on the internet. Judge Tremberg said the offence had harmed the relationship between the boy and his mother and the custodial sentence would act as a punishment and a deterrent to others. Following the hearing, investigating officer Detective Sergeant Stewart Watson said: 'Female sex offenders should not be treated any differently. I am satisfied the court has recognised that.' He said officers at Humberside Police safeguarding team were keen to hear from any other victims: 'I would urge victims of sex offences not to be put off by the justice system. There are support mechanisms in place.' Millman's husband, who owns a coach company, attended court and was said to be 'standing by his wife', according to her barrister.","Susan Millman first made contact with the teen on Facebook and bombarded him with messages .

The last photo of the Eton College pupil shows him as 'strong, fearless and kind', and 'on the cusp of adulthood' - how he was described by his devastated parents David and Olivia. Meanwhile, the father of a teenager who survived last week's attack has described his son's heroics which left him with the creature's teeth embedded in his skull. Patrick Flinders suffered a fractured skull after punching the 14ft polar bear in the face during the attack which saw his friend Horatio 'ripped to pieces'. The 16-year-old has been hailed a 'hero' by his father after 'fighting for his life' during the horrific episode on Friday. Hours before death: The last picture of Horatio Chapple, taken on Svalbard two days before the polar bear attack that killed him and injured a further four of his friends . Hero: Patrick Flinders was left with the polar bear's teeth lodged in his skull after the attack on Friday . Terry Flinders said his son was bitten on the arm and swiped in the face by the 250kg animal before Patrick tried to defend the group by jumping on the bear and 'smashing its nose' as it attacked their tent. Horatio Chapple died following the attack on Spitsbergen island, Norway, while Patrick, from Jersey, along with friend Scott Bennell-Smith, 16, survived and were flown to the UK on Sunday. Patrick underwent surgery to remove the bear's teeth from his skull and is now said to be 'conscious and lucid' at Southampton General Hospital. Trip leaders Michael 'Spike' Reid, 29, from Plymouth and Andrew Ruck, 27, who is from Brighton but lives in Edinburgh, were severely injured in the bear attack, but are now stable. Autopsy: A pair of scientists examine the body of the polar bear that was shot dead after attacking Horatio Chapple . Mr Reid shot the bear dead, but was also mauled himself. Terry Flinders said the ordeal his son went through would have affected 'even hardened SAS men', as his son and Mr Bennell-Smith saw Hortatio attacked in the same tent. Mr Flinders told the BBC Today . programme: 'Scott shot but did not kill the bear, which then went for . Patrick, he bit his arm and then just swiped his face and top of his . head. And then the same with Scottie. 'Patrick said he can't remember doing it, but I suppose it might come back to him later.' 'We are a small community here and he has become a hero. 'I've told him the girls will love . him for his bravery, and he will be able to walk through town on a . Friday night without any trouble because people will know him as the guy . who punched a 14ft polar bear. 'If three SAS men, who are hardened . people, had been in those tents and saw what Patrick and Scott saw - . their friend being ripped to pieces - they must be affected by that, let . alone a 16-year-old who fought for his life. 'His injuries are not my biggest worry because in six months time they will all be gone. 'But it must stay in his head and I don't see how anyone could put up with that.' Patrick's parents had previously thought he had only been bitten on the arm and swiped in the face by the bear. Mr Flinders added: 'I was told he had a broken skull, and said I didn't know about that. 'He had an operation to remove parts of the bear's teeth from his skull, and the surgeons did a fantastic job on him.'

'It will never leave me to think how close Scott came to being killed that day,' he said. 'I am so sorry for the loss of his new friend and fellow adventurer, Horatio. It is every parent's worst nightmare.' The family of Horatio paid tribute to him in a statement, describing him as 'strong, fearless and kind'. They said Mr Chapple had been 'so excited about his plans to be a doctor' and praised his 'amazing sense of humour and ability to laugh at himself'. Eton College, where Mr Chapple was a pupil, expressed its deep sadness at the schoolboy's death and offered its condolences to his family and friends.

Within the week, hundreds of thousands of internet users retaliated, many of them calling the video the stupidest thing on the web.

'We're hot!': Pop duo Double Take in their music video Hot Problems in which they lament the downsides to being pretty . Backlash: The video has garnered more than 100,000 'dislikes' on YouTube and a paltry 8,600 'likes' as of Saturday morning . Internet watcher Gawker jumped on the hyperbolic bandwagon, saying: ‘The worst song ever is pretty d*mn terrible.’ However, MSNBC tech blogger Helen A.S. Popkin has a very different view on the video, which was performed by Drew Garrett and Lauren Willy. She questions why, in the age when bullying is being put in the spotlight, it is so in favour to lambast teenage girls for doing something fairly harmless. While Ms Popkin doesn’t praise the girls’ musical talents (or lack thereof), she does say that the video is typical behaviour from teenage girls. Ms Garret told MTV News that she and Ms Willy meant no harm, saying: ‘It was all just for fun and to just have something we could share with our friends. 'Downsides to being pretty': Double Take have split opinion as journalist Samantha Brick, pictured, did when she wrote how women hated her because of her 'lovely looks' ‘We enjoy writing funny lyrics and songs and we decided that we really liked this one.’ Ms Willy added: ‘We knew we couldn’t really sing.’ There are more than 54,000 comments and counting on YouTube – many of them complaining over the mediocrity of the song and of its performers.

In the video, Drew and Lauren gesture flirtatiously in the back of a limousine while recounting all the obstacles they encounter with men and other girls because of their looks. Lamenting (out of tune) over a rather dodgy . electro-pop backing track, they proclaim: 'Hot girls we have problems, . too. We're just like you, except we're hot.' Other lines include: 'Please don't get me wrong. I know I'm hot, but textbook perfection really takes a lot. 'Weird guys calls my phone and girls call names... but I can't be tamed.' The song is at serious risk of splitting opinion as ferociously as Mrs Brick did when she claimed in a Daily Mail article earlier this month that women loathed her for being too attractive. She said: 'There are downsides to being pretty — the main one being that other women hate me for no other reason than my lovely looks.' Last year's meme: Double Take's video attracked derogatory comparisons to Rebecca Black's Friday which was heavily slammed last year . Her initial story attracted 1.6million hits - and thousands of vitriolic insults - on MailOnline, rising to 2.7million when including her follow-up article defending her stance. In a similar brewing storm, the 'Hot Problems' video has been watched more than a million times on YouTube, but has received more than 100,000 'dislikes' compared to just 8,600 'likes'. One poster pleaded: 'Please shoot my ears off.' As if anticipating the resultant backlash, the production company, Old Bailey Productions, made sure to distance itself from the video. 'Old Bailey Productions did not create any of the audio or lyrics for this video,' it stated in the description. 'We produced the video as a favor.' From an 'artistic' point of view, many are also making derogatory comparisons to Rebecca Black's widely slated flop Friday which was dubbed possibly the 'worst video of all time' last year. It is not entirely clear whether the high school pair are merely being tongue in cheek, but they have said they created the video 'just for fun'.","Double Take's 'Hot Problems' video gets two million YouTube hits .

French detectives have reopened their investigation into the murder of a British student 22 years ago after a tip-off about a new suspect. Joanna Parrish was raped, beaten and strangled before her body was left in a river in 1990. The 20-year-old, who was teaching at a French school as part of her university course, had arranged to meet a man who had answered her newspaper advert offering private English lessons. Mystery: Joanna Parrish (left) was found raped and strangled in a river in 1990.  The new investigation will probe convicted killer Michel Fourniret (right) and a new, unnamed, suspect . The investigation will re-examine . evidence against serial killer Michel Fourniret as well as an unnamed . new suspect, who is also a convicted murderer and sex attacker. Yesterday Miss Parrish's father Roger, 68, said: 'We are very pleased. They said there are now two strands to the investigation. 'One is Michel Fourniret and his ex-wife and there are many questions to be answered about that. Roger and Pauline Parrish are still fighting for justice, 22 years on . 'I personally think that they are the strongest suspects. The new lead we don't know much about. 'All I know is that it is a man who is . serving a prison sentence for violent sexual crimes and in the . investigations an informant told the police they suspected he was . involved in Jo's murder.' Fourniret, 69, was nicknamed the . 'Beast of the Ardennes' after he lured seven girls, aged between 12 and . 21, to remote spots before strangling, shooting or stabbing them. He was . convicted in 2008 and is serving life. He had been near Auxerre when Jo, from Newnham on Severn, Gloucestershire, was murdered, . But attempts to try Fourniret . floundered because incriminating evidence from his wife was extracted . under duress and police lost vital DNA evidence. The . Parrishes feared any chance of justice for their daughter was lost, but . they have been have been given fresh hope by the new development - . thought to have been prompted by a tip-off. The new suspect has not been named, but he is believed to be - like Fourniret - a convicted murderer. The Parrish family's lawyer Didier Seban said: 'The court has now requested the judges to . reinvestigate all aspects of the case including the Fourniret lead and a . new lead which has just emerged. 'This lead concerns another man with a . long list of criminal convictions who has been denounced.

'severe weather conditions' causing delays to flights was partly to . blame for the massive queues at Heathrow Airport. The Government is poised to make a . Commons emergency statement on the chaotic queues at immigration in the . London airport, with the Olympics looming just ahead. Speaker John Bercow has granted an urgent question to the chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, Keith Vaz. Problem: Boris Johnson expressed 'serious concern' over Heathrow, while . David Cameron claimed the disruption was partly down to severe weather . causing delays . London Mayor Boris Johnson also expressed 'serious concern' about the problem at Heathrow, in a letter to the Home Secretary today. He said the huge queues at . immigration gave 'a terrible impression of the UK' and it was . unfortunate that the country’s main port of entry was 'gaining such a . poor reputation'. Mr . Johnson told Theresa May he was looking forward to 'hearing what . measures the Home Office and the UK Border Agency plan to take in order . to rectify the situation both for the [Olympic] Games and for usual . passenger numbers'. The . Prime Minister's spokesman told a regular daily press briefing in Westminster: 'There . have been some queues over recent days, caused by a number of factors . including late planes and changes of schedules. 'We . have to make sure we don't do anything to compromise border security . but equally we need to make sure that there is a regular flow and . passengers are able to flow through the border in a reasonable way. Airlines and airport bosses fear Heathrow, which handles about 190,000 passengers a day, will be unable to cope with the millions visiting Britain for the Olympics and Diamond Jubilee . 'The Border Force is in constant . dialogue with BAA about passenger flow and is planning its resources . accordingly. The Home Secretary is going to meet the British Air . Transport Association (Bata) to discuss the steps Border Force are . taking. 'Our objective . is to keep disruption to a minimum while at the same time making sure . border security is not jeopardised in any way.' Asked . whether the Prime Minister was confident Border Force had sufficient . manpower to process passengers at Heathrow, Mr Cameron's spokesman . responded: 'It is not purely about staff numbers. 'It . is about how you deploy your resources effectively and better . management of those resources, better prioritisation of those . resources.' Big issue: Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt leaves his London home carrying the press summary that describes him as 'troubled' over Heathrow . Plans . are in place to deal with the expected increase in travellers coming . into the UK for this summer's London Olympics, said the spokesman. This could include retired border staff . returning to work for the period and trained staff being brought in from . other parts of the UK Border Agency or Government departments such as . the Home Office and HM Revenue & Customs. Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt was seen leaving his London home today carrying a press summary note that referred to his concerns over Heathrow. The minister, who has been put on probation over 'inappropriate' emails between his adviser and Rupert Murdoch, was photographed holding a document prepared by a private company for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport. It said the 'the readiness of Heathrow' was the issue that 'troubled' Mr Hunt. A top border official has sent an email to Heathrow Airport staff berating them for encouraging passengers to complain over huge queues at immigration control. The email orders airport operator BAA to stop handing out ‘inflammatory’ leaflets to passengers apologising for the ‘very long delays’ of up to several hours. It also instructs them to stop passengers taking pictures of the queues. The length of queues for arrivals at . border control has caused increasing anger, with reports of some . passengers storming through because they have grown so furious at the . delays. Airport operator BAA has tried to . defuse tensions with a leaflet apologising for the problems, saying that . people arriving in the country ‘deserved a warmer welcome’ and . explaining how to complain to the Home Office. But Marc Owen, director of Border . Force operations at Heathrow, has told BAA that the leaflets are . ‘inappropriate’ and that ministers would take ‘a very dim view’. In an email obtained by the Daily . Telegraph, he said: ‘The leaflet... is both inflammatory and likely to . increase tensions in arrivals halls, especially in the current . atmosphere. ‘It is inappropriate in that it is not for you to display how to complain on our behalf. ‘Please refrain from handing out (the . leaflets) or I will escalate (the matter) with ministers who are likely . to take a very dim view. I know there are copies in the hall and your . troops are ready with them.’ Mr Owen also told BAA to prevent . frustrated passengers taking pictures in the arrivals hall, after photos . of lengthy queues were posted on Twitter. Stretched: The document suggested the readiness of Heathrow was a big topic for the Culture Secretary . Former transport minister Jim . Fitzpatrick, Labour’s aviation spokesman, said: ‘This is a pure . cover-up. I can understand people wanting to take pictures of the . queues. This is further evidence of Border Force trying to hide the . severity of the problem. ‘Passengers need to know how to register complaints and for Border Force to try to prevent them doing so is outrageous.’ In a joint statement issued last . night, Border Force and BAA said: ‘The majority of passengers pass . through immigration control quickly but there are sometimes delays at . airports for a range of reasons. We think it’s important passengers are . given the full picture. ‘We will not compromise border security but we will work together to keep delays to a minimum.’ Labour’s immigration spokesman Chris . Bryant said: ‘The Government is in danger of scoring an extraordinary . double own goal, undermining our border security and giving a chaotic . first impression of the UK. 'No airport in the world is designed to keep . thousands of people waiting to get through passport control. May and [Immigration Minister] Damian Green need . urgently to make resources available so that the events of this week are . not repeated. ‘The Home Secretary... needs to avoid chaos at our borders come the Summer, the Olympic Games and thereafter.’ Retired immigration officers will be brought back to ease airport border control queues during the Olympics, it was reported today. Passport checkpoint veterans will return to duty over the summer to cope with the extra visitors set to descend on south east terminals. The Sunday Telegraph reported the Border Force, an agency of the Home Office, planned to spend £2.5 million bringing back ex-members of staff who will receive travel expenses, be given hotel accommodation and paid allowances of up to £30 an hour. The row comes after several incidents . of angry passengers storming past border guards at Britain’s airports in . frustration at queues. On Wednesday, a frustrated Spanish . passenger at Heathrow barged through passport control, but was . intercepted by counter-terrorism officers. But last month, about 20 . passengers stormed border control at Birmingham Airport after a two-hour . wait. Hotelier Alan Fitzpatrick described how holidaymakers made ‘a . dash for it, pushing Border Agency staff aside’. He added: ‘There were . scuffles, people being knocked to the ground and then resignation from . the powers that be, who stepped aside to let the crowd through.’ The Home Office admitted border controls had been breached but said passengers subsequently had their passports checked. On Thursday, police were deployed at Heathrow’s Terminal 5 when a group of Americans began shouting at border staff. At one terminal last week there were just three passport staff on duty for EU arrivals, and another three for non-EU nationals. The trouble has been caused by the reintroduction of full passport checks following controversy over their relaxation last year.","'Concerned' Boris Johnson has asked how the airport will be readied for Olympics .

The former British prime minister, 59, had to break off his his address as he spoke to 400 graduates and their guests at Colby College, in Maine. Protesters shouted phrases such as 'warmonger' and 'You're a war criminal' during his speech. One person was arrested. Guest of honour: Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair shakes hands with a Colby College graduate after giving the commencement address . Audience: The ceremony was attended by 400 students as well as their friends and family . In his address, Blair appealed for international cooperation and for people to try to understand other cultures. The former premier, who served from 1997 to 2007, backed the U.S. in it so-called war on terror and took Britain to war in Afghanistan and Iraq. His decision to send troops to topple Saddam Hussein prompted widespread criticism, including a massive anti-war march in London which attracted more than one million demonstrators. But, while he has long been dogged by demonstrations in Britain carrying out stunts like trying to arrest him, it is the first time his appearances in the U.S. have been hijacked by protesters. In the States, where initial opposition to the Iraq war was much smaller, Blair had long garnered widespread respect as a dynamic leader who stood by America. Furthermore, Americans usually focus their ire on George W Bush and prefer to see Blair as a man misled by the former president than someone who may have sought to deceive others. Flashpoint: Protesters outside the London Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq war where Blair gave evidence in 2010 . Anger: Protesters clash with police as Blair attends his book signing at a bookstore in Dublin in September 2010 . Anger at Blair stems from the fact his Labour government sold the case for war on a so-called 'dodgy' dossier based on false information claiming Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. Much of it was found to be plagarised from a PhD thesis and many protesters claim Blair knew its contentions - such as that Iraq could deploy chemical warheads within 45 minutes - were lies. He and his wife, Cherie, had three children when he entered office. She gave birth to another son, Leo, in 2000 - the first baby born to a serving PM in more than 150 years. Since leaving office he has made a multimillion pound fortune out of corporate consultancy and on the international speaking circuit. He has also taken up a role as official Middle East envoy of the Quartet and, in 2008, launched his Tony Blair Faith Foundation.","Blair branded 'warmonger' during speech at Colby College, Maine .

A tearful uncle has spoken about the moment he discovered the bodies of his two young nephews who had been stabbed to death by their mother. Leighton Dennis walked in on the grisly scene at the Manchester home of Romario Mullings-Sewell, two, and three-month-old Delayno Mullings-Sewell. Mr Dennis said he ‘knew something had happened’ as soon as he stepped into the house belonging to his sister Jael Mullings. Tragic: Leighton Dennis walked in on the grisly scene at the Manchester home of Romario Mullings-Sewell, left,  two, and his brother three-month-old Delayno . Mullings was sectioned indefinitely after killing Romario and Delayno on November 12, 2008. She denied murder but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Mr Dennis and his mother Andrea found the youngsters’ bodies at their home in Kilmington Drive, Cheetham Hill. They had became increasingly worried after Mullings, then 21, arrived at her auntie’s house without her two sons. She said that she was 'the devil’ and her sons were ‘at peace’, the inquest at Manchester Crown Court heard. Grim task: A forensic team enter the house in Kilmington Drive, Cheetham Hill, where the brothers were found dead . Horrifying: Mr Dennis and his mother took a taxi to Kilmington Drive and found the door unlocked - they shouted out Romario’s name but they did not get an answer, so made their way upstairs and made found the two bodies . Mr Dennis and his mother took a taxi to Kilmington Drive and found the door unlocked. Mr Dennis said the house was ‘a bit messy’ and added: 'It didn’t seem normal at all. There’s a sort of organised chaos with kids around and it’s never completely tidy. But it seemed as if something had happened.” Mr Dennis and his mum shouted out Romario’s name but they did not get an answer, so made their way upstairs. Leading Mr Dennis through his evidence, Manchester coroner Nigel Meadows said: 'Very sadly when you came into Jael’s room you saw the two children.' Troubled: Jael Mullings said that she was 'the devil' and her sons were 'at peace', the inquest at Manchester Crown Court heard . 'Yes,' replied Mr Dennis. Mr Meadows said: 'Essentially it was obvious to you that they had been injured and in simple terms there was understandable panic and there was a need to phone an ambulance. I think the children were lying on the bed?' 'Yes they were,' said Mr Dennis, who was then overcome with grief and bent over in tears. The inquest earlier heard how Mr Dennis was close to his sister and visited her once or twice a week. He told how Mullings developed an interest in religion and the search for truth. Mr Dennis said: 'As she was growing up she expressed strong spiritual beliefs. 'She wasn’t an avid churchgoer. She wanted to seek the truth. That was the sort of mission her and my mum were on at that time. (Jael) would read the bible and scriptures.' Mullings, who is now in a secure hospital unit, told her family after killing the boys that she was ‘a child of Israel’ and ‘the devil’ and had the power to give life and take it away.

Controversial new 'flexitime' arrangements are allowing Whitehall officials an extra three days holiday a month if they work over 36 hours a week, it was revealed today. More and more civil servants are working nine-day fortnights by cutting lunch breaks short and staying in the office until 6pm, allowing them extra holiday. Whitehall staff can even factor delays getting to work due to traffic into their contracted working week, according to a leaked document seen by the Daily Telegraph. Whitehall departments are said to be like 'ghost towns' on most Fridays thanks to generous contracts which allow civil servants an extra three days holiday a month . The generous contract schemes are indicative of a system which has 'hardly any controls' and sees some departments resemble 'ghost towns' at the end of most working weeks, according to one government source. The revelations are also likely to infuriate scores of company bosses in the private sector, where employees are usually contracted to a rigid 40-hour week. And it comes just days after plans emerged to let civil servants work from home for seven weeks during the Olympics and Paralympic Games in London this summer. The revelation is likely to infuriate business leaders not long after William Hague said companies should 'work harder' to boost growth . The arrangement, according to the Civil Service document, is based on the standard working week in London being 36 hours, with a working week being 37 hours outside the capital. This equates to the normal working day being slightly longer than 9am to 5pm, with an hour-long lunch break each day. Employees in the Civil Service are allowed to not take a full lunch break of work extra hours in return for accumulated overtime which they can take as time off later the same month. All Civil Service staff are eligible for the flexitime arrangement, according to the document seen by the Telegraph. A government aide told the newspaper: 'When we came into office we inherited various arrangements from the last government. We are reviewing these to ensure that they are reasonable and sensible.' Business leaders had only this week reacted with dismay to news that civil servants will be allowed to work from home during the Olympic Games. They said it sent out the dangerous message that Britain would close down for almost two months. The special dispensation, which is supposed to limit transport chaos in London, will extend from July 21 – six days before the Olympics opening ceremony – until the Paralympics ends on September 9. *The headline of this article has been amended to make clear it referred to new flexitime arrangements rather than suggesting flexitime was new.","Whitehall staff can also have delays in getting to work factored into their contracted hours .

A WOMAN has told how she was unrecognisable after an apparent reaction to her mobile phone cover left her face covered in a horrific rash. Jenny Taylor noticed her face swelling up after fitting a soft silicone Griffin FlexGrip Punch cover to her iPhone 4. The 30-year-old marketing manager developed the rash across her face and neck – with a ‘phone-shaped’ sore where she had held the handset to her ear. Jenny Taylor, 30, from Liverpool, suffered an horrific allergic reaction to an iPhone cover . Marketing manager Miss Taylor was covered in a sticky yellow 'phone-shaped' rash where she had held the handset up to her ear . Miss Taylor went to hospital when her own mother failed to recognise her, but was sent home with over-the-counter antihistamine tablets. The next morning, however, her face had swelled so much she was unable to open her right eye and could barely swallow. She returned to hospital where tests revealed she had developed 13 skin allergies. Miss Taylor, from Kirby, Liverpool, has now been warned she is allergic to dozens of household items including jeans, coins and door handles. She said: 'My neck looked like a roll of sausages and I knew I definitely needed to go back to the doctors. 'You could literally see the shape of where the phone had been on my face, lots of little spots came up in the same area. 'You could see a distinctive mobile phone shape, there was no question of what it was. 'My . mum didn’t recognise me at first, she gasped in shock when she saw me, . she was appalled. She thought I’d stay like that forever. The reaction also caused Mr Taylor's face to swell up just one week after using her iPhone 4 with a trendy new silicone case issued by Apple . The rash which covered Miss Taylor's face and neck swelled up and she said made her virtually unrecognisable . 'When I saw a new doctor they examined my throat and they got concerned when they couldn’t see down there. 'I couldn’t swallow properly, so the doctors booked me in to another hospital and told me to go there straight away.' Coins, belt buckles, and even mobile phones may also cause an unpleasant allergic reaction when they rub against the skin. The reason is that they all contain nickel, the most common cause of skin contact allergies in the industrialised world. Many millions of people know they have to avoid anything made with the metal - and now scientists understand why. They have shown that nickel binds to a particular immune-system protein normally involved in detecting harmful invaders. In susceptible people, this results in the body recognising nickel as an infectious agent and triggering inflammation. As the immune system goes into overdrive, it produces the classic symptoms of burning, itching, redness, swelling and blisters. After suffering the reaction in November Miss Taylor  was referred to the dermatology clinic at Royal Liverpool University Hospital, where she underwent 140 patch tests on her skin. The tests, which normally identify a handful of allergies, showed up an incredible 13 on Miss Taylor's skin. Doctors suggested her allergies could have been triggered by the silicone in her iPhone case. Miss Taylor, . who lives with partner Chris Oswell, 32, said: 'The doctors said that . just because I hadn’t had a reaction up to that point, it didn’t mean . that I wouldn’t have one in the future. 'The doctors gave me advice like . wearing gloves when I handle money, but I don’t do that as I’ve never . had an issue with it before. 'But I’m super-careful and I do anything I can to avoid setting off my allergies. 'I'm going on a spa date with my . boyfriend’s sister soon and stuff like that makes me really . uncomfortable because you don’t know what goes on your body when you go . to places like that. 'It’s really hard to get involved unless I take a few risks when I probably shouldn’t. 'Since . the incident with the phone case I've become a lot more sensitive to . the sun - I used to tan really well but now I have to be really careful. 'And . then I have to be really careful in terms of what chemicals are used in . suntan lotions because I could have a reaction to that as well. Miss Taylor, from Kirby, Liverpool, has now been warned she is allergic to dozens of household items including jeans, coins and door handles . 'The last bad reaction I had was at Christmas last year when I had a reaction to some kind of make-up. 'I borrowed some off my mum, and it made my eye swell up so that I couldn’t see out of it. 'It was probably a stupid thing to do but I sometimes completely forget what I’m meant to be doing and what I’m not supposed to do.' It also caused Jenny to come out in a rash if she came into contact with nickel and she is now allergic to coins, door handles and some make-up. Miss Taylor bought the £16 cover through the Apple store. She said: 'I've contacted both Apple and Griffin to warn them about my allergic reaction but I haven’t received any calls back or any letters. 'I just don’t want this to happen to anyone else because it's put my life on hold.'","Jenny Taylor, 30, noticed her face swelling up after fitting new case .

Though his extramarital exploits became public fodder some three years ago, the details of Tiger Woods’ personality off the green have been heavily guarded. Former swing coach Hank Haney is changing all of that – revealing Woods’ often selfish, egocentric behaviour in a new book. He writes during their six years together, Woods showed little respect for those around him, making others pay for takeout and simply leaving a restaurant when he was done eating - whether or not those around him had finished. Spilling the beans: Swing coach Hank Haney (left) paints a less than flattering picture of golf pro Tiger Woods (right) For months, Mr Haney was afraid to ask Woods for a Popsicle when the golfer was heading to the refrigerator. ‘He never offered me one or ever came back with one,’ he writes in his book, The Big Miss, which will be released March 27. He describes the anguish he felt over Woods’ simple lack of courtesy. ‘It actually took me a while to summon the courage to blurt out, “Hey, Bud, do you think I could have one of those Popsicles?”’ In the tell-all, Mr Haney depicts Woods as bad-mannered, cheap, and a lover of pornography and potty-humour. Before the 2006 Ryder Cup, several golfers, including devout Christian Zach Johnson, shared a hotel room with Woods. Tiger ‘immediately purchased the adult-move 24-hour package and turned it on,’ Mr Haney said, according to the New York Post. Walking on eggshells: Mr Haney says he was afraid to ask Tiger for a Popsicle and said Woods never offered . Mr Johnson had no choice but to ignore the adult programming. The ex-coach said Tiger let his fame go to his head. When he would go out to eat with now ex-wife Elin Nordegren, he’d get up and leave, expecting her to follow – even if she hadn’t finished her meal. ‘When he was done – and he habitually ate fast – you were done,’ he wrote. Though Tiger said he hated the ‘vultures’ in media for picking apart his personal life, he oddly loved his South Park depiction, in which he is seen calling Ms Nordegren a ‘fat Swedish cow.’ The coach quit via text message in May 2010 – perhaps a good move since he said Tiger was glued to his phone and would routinely ignore people to SMS. Dine and dash: Tiger would supposedly leave the restaurant as soon as he was done eating, and wouldn't wait for then-wife Elin Nordegren to finish . As it turned out, the golfer was messaging his mistresses. Woods has written off the book, calling it ‘unprofessional and very disappointing.’ He told ESPN.com in a telephone interview the book – which will be released prior to the Masters – was especially hurtful because ‘it’s someone I worked with and trusted as a friend.’ He called Mr Haney’s anecdotes ‘one-sided’ and a cheap way to earn money. ‘I’m not going to waste my time reading it,' Woods said. In the end, the 247-page book ends with Mr Haney wishing Tiger well – he even thanks him for ‘an incredibly rewarding six years.’","Swing coach Hank Haney says Tiger Woods loved potty-humour and thought being cheap was funny .

A boy with an inoperable brain tumour is using a special camera to help him remember what he's been up to each day. Jacob Tudor, nine, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, was diagnosed after suffering vomiting and headaches on a summer holiday in Cornwall last year. His condition improved after a course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but the treatment has left him with very poor short-term memory. He now wears a 'SenseCam' round his neck to help him remember what has happened throughout the day. Jacob's mother Louise said the SenseCam helped him to recall events from the day before . SenseCam: This image shows how the device records pictures based on changes in temperature and movement . It automatically takes 2,000 or more pictures a day, triggered by a change in temperature, movement, or lighting, or on a frequent timer function. Jacob can then look at the pictures to trigger and reinforce memories. His mother Louise, 36, from Westhoughton, said: 'Some days Jacob can do things and the next he can't. He will be doing sums one day, then he can't another day. 'It can be frustrating when he has learned things. He is very good with names and remembers things that were exciting or funny. 'He remembers what the SenseCam is. He keeps turning it to face himself to get on the pictures. 'We are extremely lucky. We have met so many other people who haven't been so fortunate.' Jacob Tudor will use the camera on a holiday to Greece . Jacob's parents are planning a holiday on the Greek island of Zante this summer and they are hopeful and excited that the camera will help Jacob remember the visit. The tumour initially left Jacob paralysed and unable to speak, but he is now able to walk with supervision and can speak again. Westhoughton Rotary Club paid for the £300 camera after Jacob's parents, Louise and Dave Tudor, wrote to them. A stroke in 2009 left the youngster weak down his left side and he is partially blind, but Mrs Tudor said he is a very happy boy who loves school, playing with Lego and tractors. Doctors continue to scan the tumour every three to four months to make sure it is not growing. Rotary club president Jim Yates said: 'When Louise contacted us, we were delighted that we were able to purchase this vital equipment.

The bloody attack took place on March 18 at the constituency home of Mr Rees-Mogg, the Conservative MP for North East Somerset, in West Harptree, Somerset. Dozer, a six-year-old labrador, had been playing in the garden with Ms Bower’s grandchildren when a pack of 10 dogs, which were being walked by a local man, jumped over the garden fence from a public footpath, which runs alongside Mr Rees-Mogg's land.

Nathaly Uribe has all the papers she needs to get a work permit - something the 17-year-old daughter of a construction worker only dreamed of while growing up as an illegal immigrant in the United States. The high school senior has pinned her hopes on a federal program launched this week which defers deportation for young illegal immigrants, making it easier to get a good job or go to college. Miss Uribe is just one of thousands lining up to take part in Obama's Deferred . Action for Childhood Arrivals - the Dream Act -  offering work permits to more than 1 . million young illegal immigrants, though . they would not obtain legal residency or a path to citizenship. The so-called 'Dream act' has been criticized as a shrewd political move by President Obama. Opponents accuse him of targeting the Latino vote in the last three months of his re-election campaign. The American Dream: Thousands of young illegal immigrants queued on Wednesday, August 15 at Navy Pier in Chicago to fill out applications for work permits under Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program . Whatever the political significance, however, the personal impact is clear. On Wednesday, around 13,000 people stood in line in Chicago, clutching piles of paperwork, for a workshop led by immigrant rights advocates at Navy Pier. Hundreds of potential applicants . waited . outside nonprofit offices in Los Angeles for help filing paperwork that . would lead to a work permit, Social Security number and driver's . license. 'This is my country. It's where my roots . are,' said Miss Uribe, who moved from Chile when she was a toddler and lives . in Glen Burnie, Maryland. 'It feels great to know that the country that . I call home is finally accepting me.' Less than three months before an expected tight presidential election, the new immigration program is mired in controversy. Republican critics accuse President . Barack Obama of drafting the plan to boost his political standing with . Latinos ahead of November's vote and say the program favors illegal . immigrants over unemployed American citizens during dismal economic . times. Republican presidential candidate . Mitt Romney does not support so-called Dream Act legislation for illegal . immigrants who attend college - a key group that Obama aims to reach . with this program. Hoping on a dream: President Obama works the crowd during a campaign stop in Davenport, Iowa this week.

The former Massachusetts governor has . also criticized the deferred action program but has not said it he would . reverse it, pledging instead an unspecified ""civil but resolute"" long-term fix to illegal immigration. In Arizona, which passed one of the . nation's toughest anti-immigration laws, Governor Jan Brewer signed an . executive order this week  directing state agencies to deny driver's . licenses and other public benefits to illegal immigrants who obtain work . authorizations under the program. Brewer . said the federal program doesn't give immigrants legal status and she's . following the intent of the current state law denying public benefits . to them. Initial concerns . that federal authorities might take a tough approach on applications or . that a Republican presidential victory could unravel applicants' gains . have largely been pushed aside by massive interest from thousands of . young people eager to work.

In Los Angeles, one immigrant . rights' group started hosting hourly information sessions over the last . month to keep up with the frenzy. The . Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles has handed out . 12,000 information packets about the program and is encouraging all . eligible immigrants to apply as long as they have stayed out of legal . trouble, said Angelica Salas, the organization's director. Manuel Pastor, director of the University of Southern California's Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration, said 'What . this has done is to signal that the president, who was unable to get . comprehensive immigration reform, does at least care about the situation . of these immigrants,' Pastor said. 'This is something that has been overwhelmingly popular in the immigrant population and in the Latino population in general.' Taking a chance: Thousands of undocumented people wait to fill out application forms for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program . Welcome in: Immigrants lined up for help filing applications at workshops around the country. There are fears that filing the identity documents might put relatives at risk of deportation . Some Republican lawmakers have accused Obama of sidestepping Congress and creating a backdoor amnesty program. 'It's a betrayal of American young people,"" said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican. 'We're . supposed to be representing the interests of the American people - not . people who come here illegally from other countries.' In . an internal document outlining the program's implementation, Department . of Homeland Security officials estimated more than 1 million people . would apply in the first year and about 890,000 would be eligible. On . Wednesday, immigrants lined up for help filing applications at . workshops around the country. Others sought identity documents from . consulates to be able to apply. Dreams come true? President Obama and First Lady Michele arrive for a campaign rally on Wednesday in Davenport, Iowa . Jaqueline Cinto said she's still working on gathering the documents she needs, knowing it's her only shot at putting her master's degree in education to good use. But she's nervous that filing the papers might put her relatives at risk for deportation - even though Homeland Security officials have said they will generally not use applicants' information to track down other family. 'I am even more afraid that I might be denied,"" said Cinto, 26, who came to New York more than a decade ago from Mexico. The documents to prove identity could . include passports, birth certificates, school transcripts, medical, . financial and military records. Multiple sworn affidavits, signed under . penalty of perjury, can also be used, Homeland Security officials said.

Worth the wait: People line up for assistance with paperwork at the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles in California . Laura Lichter, a Denver attorney who heads the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said everyone takes a risk by applying. 'I would say that people are between a rock and a hard place. In most cases, people can take (the government) at their word that their intent is to administer this policy in a fair and appropriate manner but there are going to be people that are going to find themselves having problems,' she saidA decision on each application could take several months, and immigrants have been warned not to leave the country while their application is pending. The lines on Wednesday grew throughout the day; the crowd in Chicago was so large that workshop organizers told them to come back another day.'Navy Pier is today's Ellis Island, and while they saw New York City, today they see Chicago,' said Illinois congressman Luis Gutierrez.

"Standard & Poor’s . puts France on warning that its AAA credit rating is at risk while . Britain’s is 'stable' By . Tim Shipman and Hugo Duncan . UPDATED: . 05:57 EST, 19 December 2011 . A week ago it was Britain that looked isolated from Europe following David Cameron’s veto of a eurozone treaty. But yesterday it was France and its president Nicolas Sarkozy who seemed to have no friends left after a devastating triple whammy. First, French prime minister Francois Fillon was rebuked by Nick Clegg, who said a series of provocative comments about the British were ‘simply unacceptable’. French President Nicolas Sarkozy and French Prime Minister Francois Fillion are looking increasing isolated after both launched attacks on Britain . Secondly, amid fears that the floundering French economy is heading for the rocks, a report revealed that nervous British banks pulled almost £20billion out of the country between July and September. Thirdly, German Chancellor Angela Merkel . told David Cameron she wants to resist Mr Sarkozy’s grandiose plans to . redraw EU rules and undermine Britain’s interests in the EU single . market. World Bank President Robert Zoellick has said he is 'deeply troubled' by the row between Britain and France over resolving the euro zone debt crisis especially at a time when the region's economic problems are far from solved.'I have been deeply troubled over the past couple of days to see some of the commentary going across the English Channel, not only comments from France but also from Brussels, and others,' Zoellick told the Atlantic Council.Zoellick said it was important in the face of the deep financial and economic crisis engulfing the euro zone that European leaders acted responsibility.'They need to be careful because I think you've got a tinderbox out there in both political and economic terms.'He cautioned that populist political tensions often led to protectionism. 'The European Union should be the last place we see internal protectionism,' he added. Mr Cameron’s relationship with Mr Sarkozy – forged during the war in Libya – appears to have broken down, with Downing Street announcing that he has ‘no plans’ to talk to the president. On Wednesday, Mr Sarkozy dismissed the . Prime Minister as an ‘obstinate kid’ over his use of the veto in . Brussels. And Mr Fillon put the boot into Britain, declaring: ‘Our . British friends have a higher deficit and debt [than us] but it seems . the ratings agencies have not yet noticed.’ Early yesterday French finance minister Francois Baroin took another pot shot at the UK just 24 hours after the head of the Bank of France called for the UK’s credit rating to be downgraded. ‘The economic situation of Great Britain is very worrying,’ said Mr Baroin. ‘From the point of view of the economy, it is preferable to be French than British at the moment.’ Amid British fury at the attacks, Mr Fillon was forced to ring David Cameron’s Europhile deputy Nick Clegg and explain himself. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘Mr Fillon made clear it had not been his intention to call into question the UK’s rating but to highlight that ratings agencies appeared more focused on economic governance than deficit levels. ‘The Deputy Prime Minister accepted his explanation but made the point that recent remarks from members of the French government about the UK economy were simply unacceptable and that steps should be taken to calm the rhetoric.’ Taking no prisoners: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg told Mr Fillon his comments were 'simply unacceptable' No 10 suggested that the aggression was the result of sour grapes over Britain’s veto last week and pointed out that ‘numerous international organisations’ have endorsed the UK’s plans to tackle the deficit. Ratings agency Standard & Poor’s has put France on warning that its AAA credit rating is at risk while Britain’s is ‘stable’. And it emerged that British banks voted with their feet over the summer and cut their exposure to France by £18.8billion or nearly ten per cent, to £177billion. A report by the Bank of England underlined just how worried is the City of London  about the French economy and its exposure to the eurozone. British banks also pulled a combined total of £13billion out of debt-ridden Italy and Spain and invested in Germany and the U.S. instead. Fair weather friends? Firm allies just last week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel (right) today distanced herself from Mr Sarkozy . Last night another ratings agency, Fitch, announced it is considering downgrading the ratings of Italy, Spain, Ireland, Belgium, Slovenia and Cyprus. It said that ‘a comprehensive solution to the eurozone crisis is technically and politically beyond reach’. With criticism that the treaty unveiled last week was a ‘Loch Ness monster: most people have heard about it but no one has seen it’, Brussels officials yesterday offered fresh details. Eurozone countries will have to get their total debt levels below 60 per cent of national income and limit annual budget deficits to 3 per cent of GDP. But Chancellor Merkel told Mr Cameron yesterday she wants the new deal to concentrate on new rules to enforce fiscal discipline – not result in an assault on the single market.","Nervous banks pulled £20bn out of France between July and September .

The director of a chimpanzee rescue facility where an American student was mauled by two chimps that he was caring for says that the creatures were also victims. Andrew Oberle, 26, was conducting a tour at the Jane Goodall Institute Chimpanzee Eden on June 28 when he was suddenly dragged under an electric fence and savagely attacked. The two alpha male chimps, Nikki and Amadeus, also dragged Oberle about a half mile away, and paramedics were forced to wait for armed escorts before they could go in and treat him.

Attack: Andrew Oberle, a University of Texas graduate student was savaged by two chimps while leading a group of tourists at the Jane Goodall Institute in South Africa . Speaking to ABC’s 20/20 this week, institute director Eugene Cussons said the chimps both had difficult upbringings before coming to the institute, and should be considered victims along with Oberle. Cussons told the network: '[Nikki] used to wear human clothes, he was shaved, it was very much like a human child.' He added: 'Amadeus had a more traumatic past. He was just a baby and a product of the bush meat trade. Some of his family members were being cooked and served.' Cussons also said that Oberle should have been more careful while he was conducting the tour, and a slight misstep led to his near-fatal mistake.

He said: 'You have to always keep in mind that these are wild creatures. [Oberle] had a lapse in judgment across the safety boundary and get too close to the main fence, and he took his eyes off the chimpanzees when he did that.' Oberle, a researcher at the University of Texas at San Antonio, was subjected to hours of surgery following the attack, and suffered large cuts to his head and face that left his skull and facial bones exposed. During the surgeries, Oberle was kept in a medically-induced coma to keep him comfortable.Mr Oberle's uncle, Carl Oberle, described chimps as his nephew's 'passion' and said he knew each animal by its 'name and face.'

Animal lover: Oberle was subjected to hours of surgery following the attack, and suffered large cuts to his head and face that left his skull and facial bones exposed . Calm before the storm: On Facebook these sleeping chimps (not the ones which attacked) are described by Oberle as 'cute' Shortly after the incident, Cussons said both Nikki and Amadeus were calm and actually exhibited remorse, which he claimed chimps show by behaving submissively. Neither will be euthanized. Oberle’s mother said that her son had been passionate about chimps since watching a documentary about famous naturalist Jane Goodall in seventh grade.

"By . Beth Stebner and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 05:49 EST, 18 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 15:03 EST, 18 March 2012 . On the six-month anniversary of the Occupy Wall Street movement, protesters swarmed its birthplace –Zuccotti Park – again sparking the cat-and-mouse clashes between New York City police officers and demonstrators. The sweep of the park by police just before midnight capped a day of demonstrations and marching in lower Manhattan. As of Sunday afternoon, there were 73 people were detained by police. The clashes began around 11.30pm Saturday night as protesters began breaking the official rule of the park which forbids the use of tents in an effort to curb overnight protests. Breaking rules: Police say that they started arresting protesters when they saw tents and sleeping bags which are both banned from the park in an effort to prevent night-long protests . Injuries: Witnesses said that police beat protesters with batons and night sticks, as this protester is taken away by ambulance . Anniversary: NYPD officers clash with members of the Occupy Wall St movement at Zuccotti park in New York last night . Several arrests: A bus was brought in to remove the arrested protesters . Witnesses claimed that police gave . the protesters very little notice before police entered the park and . forced the protesters out. Some even said that police beat the . protesters as they detained them, though there are no official figures . to check those claims against. 'Most of the people, they left the . park. People who refused to leave and were staying were arrested,' said . NYPD detective Brian Sessa. An unused public transit bus was brought in to cart away about a dozen demonstrators in plastic handcuffs. One female under arrest apparently suffered a seizure and had difficulty breathing. She was taken away in an ambulance to be treated. For hours, the demonstrators had been . chanting and holding impromptu meetings in the park to celebrate the . anniversary of the movement that has brought attention to economic . inequality, as police mainly kept their distance. 'They . set up tents. They had sleeping bags,' Mr Sessa told the Associated Press. Taken down: One protester missing his right shoe is pinned to the ground by an NYPD officer . The clash: An NYPD officer runs after a woman in green as those around her are being arrested . Electrical boxes also were tampered with and there was evidence of . graffiti. Mr Sessa said . Brookfield Properties, the park owner, sent in security to advise the . protesters to stop pitching tents and to leave the park. The protesters, in turn, became . agitated with them. The company then asked the police to help them clear . out the park, the detective said. Many protesters shouted and officers . took out their batons after a demonstrator threw a glass bottle at the . bus that police were using to detain protesters. Sandra . Nurse, a member of Occupy's direct action working group, said police . treated demonstrators roughly and made arbitrary arrests. She disputed . the police assertion that demonstrators had broken park rules by putting . up tents or getting out sleeping bags. Reigniting the movement: Saturday was the Occupy movement's six month anniversary which prompted protesters to head back out to its birthplace in Zuccotti Park . Stand off: 'Most of the people, they left the park. People who refused to leave and were staying were arrested,' said NYPD detective Brian Sessa . Famous face: Activist and outspoken filmmaker Michael Moore joined protesters and spoke briefly at the rally, calling it 'the beginning' American Spring: More than a dozen arrested protesters sit on the ground outside of Zuccotti Park; protesters are likening the Occupy movement to the Arab Spring . 'I . didn't see any sleeping bags,' she said. 'There was a banner hung . between two trees and a tarp thrown over it ... It wasn't a tent. It was . an erect thing, if that's what you want to call it.' She said they had reports of about 25 demonstrators arrested in the police sweep. Protesters . reconvened at the park following afternoon marches through New York's . financial district. By 11pm, roughly 300 had gathered there. 'People are concerned that they have no control over their own . democracy. They have no control over their own lives. This is the beginning. This park is sacred ground for millions across the country.' -Filmmaker Michael Moore . 'This . is our spring offensive,' Michael Premo, 30, of New York told Reuters. He identified himself as a spokesman for the movement. 'People think the Occupy movement has gone away. It's important for people to see we're back.' Inspired . by the pro-democracy Arab Spring, the Wall Street protesters targeted . U.S. financial policies they blamed for the yawning income gap between . rich and poor in the country, between what they called the one per cent . and the 99 per cent. The demonstrators set up camp in Zuccotti Park on September 17 and sparked a wave of protests across the United States. Events got under way near midday on . Saturday, with street theatre troupes performing and guitar players . leading sing-alongs. Some boisterous protesters marched through the . streets of the financial district, chanting 'bankers are gangsters' and . cursing at police. Spreading the love: Calling the move their spring offensive, Saturday night's protest was timed with the six-month anniversary . Peace versus police: Though the protesters have come and gone in waves since the initial stand off, Zuccotti Park has been the hub of the movement's activity within New York . As they have in past marches, . protesters led police on a series of cat-and-mouse chases. Marchers at . the front of the crowd would suddenly turn down narrow side streets, . startling tourists and forcing police to send officers on motor scooters . to contain the crowd. The movement has made headlines for its clashes with police after campsites were set up for months in cities from New York to California. The camps were eventually shut down by authorities citing zoning regulations and public health concerns. In New York, the Occupy movement lost significant momentum in November when a pre-dawn sweep broke up the encampment at Zuccotti, although Occupy protests in Oakland, California, in January led to police firing tear gas into crowds of protesters and more than 200 were arrested. Civil disobedience: Protesters that have been arrested sit on the ground in plastic hand cuffs . Hovering: Police stand over a detained protester; one NYPD officer holds another set of plastic hand cuffs . Protester Paul Sylvester, 24, of . Massachusetts said he was 'thrilled' to be back at the park but said he . hoped the movement would begin to crystallize around specific goals. 'We need to be more concrete and specific,' he said. Critics say the Occupy movement lacks direction and clear demands. It . continues to draw celebrities, however. On Saturday night, independent . filmmaker Michael Moore strode through the park before the police . incursion. 'I think it's great that this movement continues to grow,' Mr Moore said. 'I think the goals are clear. People are concerned that they have no control over their own democracy. They have no control over their own lives. 'This is the beginning. This park is sacred ground for millions across the country.' As always, the protesters focused on a variety of concerns, but for Tom Hagan, his sights were on the giants of finance. 'Wall Street did some terrible things, especially Goldman Sachs, but all of them. Everyone from the banks to the rating agencies, they all knew they were doing wrong. ... But they did it anyway. Because the money was too big,' he said. Dressed in an outfit that might have been more appropriate for the St. Patrick's Day parade, the 61-year-old salesman wore a green shamrock cap and carried a sign asking for saintly intervention: 'St. Patrick: Drive the snakes out of Wall Street.' Chalkupy Wall Street: Earlier in the day, protesters chalked OW-inspired phrases in Zuccotti Park . Stacy Hessler held up a cardboard sign that read, 'Spring is coming,' a reference, she said, both to the Arab Spring and to the warm weather that is returning to New York City. She said she believes the nicer weather will bring the crowds back to Occupy protests, where numbers have dwindled in recent months since the group's encampment was ousted from Zuccotti Park by authorities in November. But now, 'more and more people are coming out,' said the 39-year-old, who left her home in Florida in October to join the Manhattan protesters and stayed through much of the winter. 'The next couple of months, things are going to start to grow, like the flowers.' Some have questioned whether the group can regain its momentum. This month, the finance accounting group in New York City reported that just about $119,000 remained in Occupy's bank account - the equivalent of about two weeks' worth of expenses. But Ms Hessler said the group has remained strong, and she pronounced herself satisfied with what the Occupy protesters have accomplished over the last half year. 'It's changed the language,' she said. 'It's brought out a lot of issues that people are talking about. And that's the start of change.'","Protesters gathered at Zuccotti Park on six-month anniversary of movement .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 04:07 EST, 14 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:35 EST, 14 August 2012 . An Indian yoga guru leading a nationwide campaign against corruption is coming under increasing scrutiny over his own alleged financial irregularities. Baba Ramdev has millions of supporters and his daily TV programme is watched across India. Last June he held a nine-day anti-corruption hunger strike in Delhi before police evicted him. Yesterday, he was arrested on suspicion of violating prohibitory orders after calling for the removal of India's Congress party from its ruling coalition government at another protest against corruption near the country's parliament. He was later released. Under investigation: Baba Ramdev has millions of supporters and his daily TV programme is watched by millions across India. But organisations he is linked to are under investigation . At the start of his protest walk, which was attended by thousands of supporters, he said: 'Remove the Congress party and save the nation.' But while the star, who is known for sitting in the lotus position and performing breathing exercises on his show,  has embarked on a collision course with the Congress-led UPA government, organisations linked to him have come under investigation. A note prepared by the Directorate General of Central Excise Intelligence in July 2012 reveals charges were made against Ramdev's Patanjali Yog Peeth Trust at Haridwar in Uttarakhand as well as other organisations linked with him with financial irregularities. The DGCEI conducted a special audit and identified six major areas of investigation, the first being the overriding powers Ramdev has been accorded in the trust deed of PYPT. Also under the scanner is a 'donation', ranging from '11,000 to 11 lakh', received by the trust from corporate members for services rendered through yoga camps. The star was arrested at a protest walk, which was attended by thousands of supporters . This, the DGCEI noted, was in the nature of fees and not donation. The tax sleuths have also called into question the huge tract of land the PYPT possesses on the basis of unregistered documents, the trust's activities outside India - being carried out without obtaining any general or special order from the Central Board of Direct Taxes, and its 'illegal activity'. The DGCEI also observed that while the Vanprastha Scheme applicants paid money to enjoy lifelong residence in cottages, the amounts shelled out did not qualify as donations because they were received in exchange for services rendered. The primary focus of the special audit was on how money was being received by both PYPT and Divya Yog Mandir Trust to enable entities and individuals to participate in various schemes. According to the authority, showing these amounts as donations was a direct evasion of service tax. The note also disclosed that a showcause notice had been issued to PYPT by the additional director general, Delhi zonal unit, on April 24, 2012. It demanded service tax totalling 4.94 crore for the period from October 1, 2006, to March 31, 2011. The document stated that the case was pending adjudication with the state of Meerut's central excise commissioner. It added: 'The investigation revealed that PYPT is charging fees from participants in the name of donations wherein they send donation coupons printed by them to be sold at the local level. 'All the proceeds received from donation coupons are repatriated to PYPT. But the services provided by them are covered under ""health and fitness services"", which are defined under section 65 (51) and attract service tax under section 65 (105) of the Finance Act, 1994.' DYMT was also put in the dock for earning rent from immovable property but not paying service tax. The audit note said: '[It was only] after the initiation of the inquiry [that] they obtained registration and deposited service tax amounting to 19.78 lakh along with interest.'","Ramdev has millions of supporters and his TV show is watched across India .

A deputy headmaster with an unblemished 40-year career was dragged through the courts after an ‘uncontrollable’ seven-year-old boy accused him of assault. Royden Cope was ‘marched out’ of his Church of England primary school and endured a five-month legal nightmare before he was eventually cleared by magistrates. The chairman of the bench, Graham Parr, declared there were ‘real doubts’ about the case. Afterwards, Mr Cope’s daughter Joy Corrigan, 33, who is also a teacher, said: ‘The saddest thing is that my dad was nearing retirement and after such a long career one of his resounding memories will be being marched off the premises. It should not have ended like this.’ Mrs Corrigan, whose eight-year-old daughter was in her father’s class at the school, St Bartholomew’s in Great Harwood, Lancashire, added: ‘We have had to move her out of the school. Every day she would get asked questions about where my dad was, and she was getting distressed. ‘She was also being goaded by this young boy who seemed impressed about what he had done.’ Mr Cope, 63, whose record was ‘impeccable’ as deputy head for 34 years, was accused of restraining the boy by his wrists and then slapping him across the face. But he said the boy had slammed his head into his hand during an hysterical outburst. He could have been jailed for up to six months if found guilty. The incident happened on March 9 when the youngster ran amok, hitting ten classmates with his bag, pinning one of them to the wall, and yelling at teachers. Mr Cope was called out of a rehearsal for a forthcoming school production of Wind In The Willows to deal with him. One teacher said the boy was in such a temper his face was bright red, and he grabbed railings to stop himself being taken to Mr Cope’s classroom, repeatedly screaming: ‘Get off me, get off me’, the court heard. Mr Cope, wearing a grey pinstripe suit, told Blackburn magistrates: ‘He had worked himself into an incandescent rage, but I thought I would eventually calm him down and just needed to be firm with him. He was next to a cupboard and a desk leg, and I held him by the hands as I was concerned he would bang his head. ‘I was trying to stop his head from rolling around so I put my hand out to stop him. That’s when he slammed into my hand and there was contact.’ He added: ‘I am a teacher with over 40 years’ experience and with a good reputation within the school and local community. This allegation has caused me and my family great distress.’ However another teacher, Thomas Lowe, claimed he did see Mr Cope striking the child and recalled him saying: ‘Do you want another? I can hit you again.’ 'Marched off': Mr Cope was forced off the premises of St Bartholomew's School in Great Hardwood, Lancashire, and faced a five-month legal battle before he was cleared . Mr Lowe told the court that when Mr Cope took the boy into his classroom, he had followed as he felt he should ‘support’ his colleague who had recently suffered a heart attack. He said: ‘Mr Cope released or lost control of the boy’s left arm and then he struck him across the face.’ However this version of events was rejected by the magistrates. After the verdict, Mr Cope’s wife Carole, 63, a retired reception class teacher, said the family wanted to rebuild their lives. A parent at the 236-pupil school, Wendy Litherland, described Mr Cope as ‘an absolutely outstanding teacher’ and said: ‘He has dedicated his life to the school and all the parents are 100 per cent behind him. ‘This boy is still at the school wandering around the playground, attacking other children. It is just disgraceful.’ In his statement to police, Mr Cope said the boy – who cannot be named for legal reasons – was the most ‘disruptive and aggressive’ he had ever encountered and had been removed from class in his first year for hitting other children. Mr Cope told the court that on the day of the incident, the boy was ‘kicking off’ and being ‘very belligerent’. He said: ‘On some occasions he is uncontrollable. I would say that as he has got older, he has become more aware of his own physical prowess and he has become more aggressive.’ The boy told his mother that he had been hit by Mr Cope three days after the alleged incident. She said he had described ‘a struggle’ and said Mr Cope had grabbed his wrists before he ‘slapped him’. Last night Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ‘There are times when teachers do have to use physical restraint, even with young children, to prevent them hurting themselves or others, and it is perfectly within the law.’ Lancashire county council said Mr Cope remained suspended pending an internal inquiry.","Royden Cope was accused of assaulting a seven-year-old pupil at St Bartholomew's in Great Harwood, Lancashire .

Gunman: Page was given a general . discharge from the army in October 1998 and had been demoted from . sergeant to specialist during his service. He was deemed ineligible for . re-enlistment . Fears: Armed police investigate the Sikh Temple where it was initially believed that there was more than one gunman . Det Papineau admitted that the possibility that the cases . are linked seems remote, but ‘I haven’t ruled it out.’ Based on shell casings discovered at the scene of the Elk . Grove shooting, investigators determined that Singh and Atwal were shot by a . semi-automatic or assault weapon. Page used a semi-automatic handgun in the Temple massacre, . but it is not yet known if Page had visited California last year. Papineau told the Sacramento Bee that Elk Grove police are . working with authorities in Wisconsin, but 'obviously they've got their hands . full.' Page killed himself after exchanging gunfire with heroic cop . Lt Brian Murphy, who was the first officer to the scene. Response: After exchanging gunfire with a police officer, Page shot himself . Gunman: Page, a former soldier, was said . to be a frustrated neo-Nazi who had been the leader of a racist . white-power band . Lt Murphy, who was shot eight times, is currently recovering . at a nearby hospital. Page, who was kicked out of the army in 1998 when he worked . at Fort Bragg in Psychological Operations, gave an interview two years ago to . white supremacist website Label 56, telling them that he started the band End . Apathy because of his wish to 'figure out how to end people's apathetic ways . and start moving forward'. The six victims - aged between 39 and 84 - have been . identified as Bhai Seeta Singh, 41, Bhai Parkash Singh, 39, Bhai Ranjit Singh, . 49, Satwant Singh Kaleka, 62, Subegh Singh, 84, Parmjit Kaur Toor, 41. Page was given a less-than-honourable discharge in October 1998 . following a 'pattern of misconduct' including being drunk on duty and going . AWOL.

Baby wipes are as safe and effective as cotton wool and water and can even soothe nappy rash, according to scientists. A wipe is as gentle on baby skin as the cotton wool and water washing technique recommended by Government health experts, it is claimed. Researchers at Manchester University tested the wipe against cotton wool and water on 280 babies over a three-year period. The high street wipe tested is as gentle on baby skin as the cotton wool and water washing technique recommended by Government health experts . They discovered that wipes are ‘as effective and as safe as water - but much more convenient for parents'. And babies cleaned with wipes suffer less nappy rash. The findings run contrary to guidelines . from the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (Nice), which . recommends that parents wash newborns with cotton wool and water . to avoid skin irritation. Babies under the age one lose more moisture through their skin than older children and are more vulnerable to irritation, meaning parents have to use gentler washing techniques. Lead researcher Tina Lavender said 'the wipes were ‘equivalent to water and cotton wool in terms of skin hydration'. They also revealed slightly lower levels of maternal-reported napkin dermatitis - or nappy rash - among babies washed with wipes than those who had water and cotton wool used on them. Professor Lavender said: 'Our trial provides us with . the strongest evidence available so far that we shouldn’t base our . practice on tradition alone and that Nice needs to look at its current . guidelines. 'For the first . time, we now have a robust, adequately-powered study that can be used in . practice, the results of which should be adopted by our national . guidelines. 'These results should provide . healthcare professionals with much needed evidence-based information, . giving them the option to support the skin-care cleansing regime best . suited to individual parents and their newborn babies.' The experiment was sponsored . by wipe manufacturer Johnson & Johnson using their Extra Sensitive . Wipes. But Professor Lavender said the research was carried out under ‘strict, independent scientific . protocols’, using blind tests and peer reviews. She added: 'Our research, looking at one high street baby wipe, wanted to test whether the product was as safe and effective on newborn babies’ skins as water alone to see if midwives could help give parents more options than current guidelines provide. 'Parents can now be confident that using this specific baby wipe, proven in the largest randomised clinical trial conducted in newborn cleansing, is equivalent to water alone.' The research was published in the journal BMC Paediatrics.","Researchers tested one high street wipe against cotton wool and water on 280 babies over three years .

Two in five new mothers have struggled to cope with the demands of parenting during the first few weeks after birth, with a similar amount admitting getting 'angry' with their baby, according to a poll. A further one in five were frequently very upset at their child's crying during the first eight weeks, a survey by the NSPCC has found. Almost three-quarters (72 per cent) of new mothers wanted more professional advice before their baby was born, on subjects such as how to deal with anxiety, fear and depression, the effects of their own sleep deprivation and how to cope with their baby's crying and sleeplessness. Struggle: Two in five new mothers have struggled to cope in the weeks following their child's birth, with a similar amount admitting getting 'angry' with their baby (picture posed by model) Two in five of the mothers polled by YouGov on behalf of the charity either find it fairly difficult or very difficult to cope with the demands of looking after their newborn baby. There was also a marked difference between the number of ante-natal classes attended by well-off parents compared with those from a more disadvantaged background. The NSPCC called on the Government to ensure sufficient resources are available to 'provide the services babies and their families need'. Mothers need better support in dealing with the 'emotional turmoil' of looking after a young child, according to Chris Cuthbert, the charity's head of strategy and development for children under one. 'Currently much of the focus of antenatal education is on physical health, such as the choice of pain relief during labour,' he said. The NSPCC study found that women from better backgrounds were more likely to attend antenatal classes . 'However, we want both mothers and fathers to have access to high-quality antenatal education on the practicalities of caring for a baby that prepares parents for the emotional challenges they will face. 'This will help them cope with the impact it will have on their life, their relationships and their own well-being and assist them in being the best parents they can be. 'We appreciate times are tough financially but failing to provide vital support to new mums is a false economy. Damage done at this stage of their lives can prevent them reaching their full potential which also has a knock-on effect on society as a whole. 'Babies who are not well cared for are more likely to struggle at school and to have behavioural and relationship problems in later life.' The online poll of 516 women with babies aged under one finds that around three-fifths (57 per cent) 'felt isolated with no one to turn to'. While two-thirds of new mothers from well-off families attended antenatal classes, less than two-fifths  of less well-off mums had done so. Siobhan Freegard, founder of the Netmums parenting website, said the first few weeks of a baby's life are vital for their development but 'can turn a mother's life upside down'. 'Lack of sleep, isolation and loneliness and the fear they are not mothering in the right way can combine to make new mums feel distraught,' she said. 'Many women who have been cared for throughout pregnancy can feel abandoned after the initial euphoria of the birth has worn off. But this is often the time they need most support.'","NSPCC calls on Government to .

Police have reopened their inquiry into the mysterious death of a black bus driver, just days after being accused of racism. In a dramatic move, Scotland Yard said a new team of detectives will re-examine the evidence surrounding the final moments of Kester David, 53. His charred remains were discovered under a railway arch almost two years ago and officers insisted he took his own life. Scotland Yard is to reopen the investigation into Kester David's death after complaints of racism from his family . But on Sunday, his family called for an independent inquiry after a damning internal investigation revealed a ‘catalogue of errors’ by police. They are suing the force and fear he may have been murdered. The family claim detectives failed to fulfil their duties because the victim was black. The troubling case was the latest to come to light as a racism controversy threatens to engulf the London force. The independent police watchdog is re-examining ten cases in which Met officers have been accused of racism over the past two years. Last night broadcaster and historian Alex Pascall, who is supporting the family, said they were pleased at the decision. ‘It is good news,’ he said. ‘The way this matter has been dealt with has been extremely poor. ‘Whether you are black, white or green, it doesn’t matter. The way police have treated the family has been atrocious.’ An inquest at Barnet Coroner's Court in January last year into Kester David's death recorded an open verdict . A leaked report said police who investigated his death were responsible for blunders which ‘amount to a failing in duty’. Officers had not checked CCTV footage, failed to cross-reference DNA from the scene, did not examine phone evidence and ignored potential key witnesses. Mr David died from 100 per cent burns and inhaling petrol fumes. His body was found in North London, in July 2010. His mother Winifred Griffith compared the inquiry to the Stephen Lawrence murder, claiming it shows that the Met has learnt little from the case. At an inquest, a coroner returned an open verdict on Mr David after a forensic expert said he could not rule out the involvement of someone else.","Kester David, 53, found dead in North London in 2010 ."

Two experienced airline pilots were sacked after having a furious row on board a plane when they encountered turbulence. Captain Stephen Bird had referred to senior first officer Stephen Akers as his ‘bitch’ before their jet took off from Exeter to Spain, a tribunal heard. When they later flew into turbulence, Captain Bird ignored Mr Akers’s request to avoid dark clouds and the argument began, the hearing in Exeter was told yesterday. Captain Stephen Bird (left) and First Officer Stephen Akers (right) were sacked from FlyBe following an argument in the cockpit of an aeroplane from Exeter to Malaga . Mr Akers allegedly called Captain Bird a ‘control freak’ and told him to ‘**** off’. An investigation by their airline, Flybe, resulted in the sacking of both men, who are in their 50s and now representing themselves in an unfair dismissal case. Captain Bird, of Northam, Devon, told the tribunal that banter was common between Flybe pilots, many of whom are ex-military. Tension between the two men started when Mr Akers, of Exeter, asked the captain if the flight log – recording fuel, weather and destination details – had been finished. Captain Bird replied he had not done it ‘because you’re my bitch’. The captain said the comment was ‘clearly jovial’ and he did not realise former RAF squadron leader Mr Akers ‘found it offensive’, but he later apologised.When the flight encountered turbulence, Mr Akers urged Captain Bird to avoid dark clouds for safety reasons. Flybe found there had been a 'massive breakdown' between the pilots that could have put passenger safety at risk . But the tribunal heard that the captain decided to go through them because the flight, last May, was already running 25 minutes late. Mr Akers was said to have become very ‘agitated’ and the captain later said: ‘Sorry, that was worse than I expected.’ The hearing was told Mr Akers wanted to pursue the conversation, but Captain Bird told him to ‘fly the plane’, adding he would be happy to discuss it once they had landed in Malaga. The captain said Mr Akers then called him a ‘control freak’ and he replied: ‘Wow, now I can see why you have had issues with other captains.’ Captain Bird added that if the co-pilot continued to argue with him he would have no choice but to report the incident to the company, to which Mr Akers allegedly replied: ‘**** off.’ The row lasted several minutes but the plane landed safely. Mr Akers ‘stormed off the flight deck’ in Malaga, almost hitting the head of a senior member of the cabin crew with the flight deck door, the tribunal was told. The return flight took place in ‘virtual silence’ with Mr Akers reading a newspaper. Mr Akers told the tribunal that former Royal Marine Captain Bird never supported him and he was ‘patronised and humiliated’. He added that he was concerned about the weather on the flight because two weeks earlier his plane had been struck by lightning. The Captain, who has ten years command experience, said he was aware of Mr Akers' temper but did not feel the plane should be grounded for the return flight because of a 'relatively minor altercation'. The return flight was in 'virtual silence' with Mr Akers reading a newspaper and they landed after a 'perfectly safe and uneventful' trip. Once on the ground Captain Bird said . he always shakes the hand of his First Officer, but Mr Akers told him: . 'You owe me a f***ing apology.' The pair were on a flight from Exeter (pictured) to Malaga when the argument broke out . The . skipper said: 'I was shocked by his reaction. Stephen Akers called me a . liar and made several offensive remarks about me personally. He stormed . off leaving me to complete the shutdown and secure the aircraft.' Both pilots phoned their manager, Captain Stan Wood, about the incident and he told them to file an Air Safety Report. They were both sacked. Since his sacking, Captain Bird has not found any work despite applying to be an estate agent and work at a tile factory. Despite his flying skills, he said his future may be as a handyman. He said Captain Bird had told him: 'I am the Captain, just fly the plane.' The black box cockpit voice recorder was not used in evidence because the row on the way to Spain would have been wiped by the flight on the way back to Devon. Captain Bird has 1,100 hours flying time and Stephen Akers 2,000 hours, the tribunal was told. Captain Bird had been on sick leave for seven months and on anti-depressants after a messy divorce, said Mr Akers. Captain Wood, who led the investigation, said any breakdown in crew relationships caused a 'potential risk to safety' of the passengers, crew and plane. He said there had been a 'massive breakdown' between the pilots and his inquiry concluded that both pilots had been 'yelling at each other'. Captain Bird and Mr Akers said they had clean disciplinary records.The hearing continues.","Captain Stephen Bird and First Officer Stephen Akers hadn't even got off the ground when an argument started .

They are designed to make the process of ferrying hundreds of VIPs and officials to Olympic venues more environmentally friendly. But three low-emission taxis introduced in London for the Games had to be transported on a 130-mile round trip to Swindon to refuel. The black cabs run on hydrogen, but a fuelling station at Lea Interchange near the Olympic Park has been closed for security reasons. Long journey: Low emission taxis like the one above were taken on a 130-mile round trip from London to Swindon to be refuelled . A new fuelling station opened near Heathrow airport today, according to the consortium behind the scheme, the Hydrogen Transport for European Cities project (HYTEC). Until then, however, the taxis had to be loaded on to a transporter to be taken to the nearest station - at car manufacturer Honda's Swindon plant. HYTEC co-ordinator Diana Raine said: 'The fuelling at Swindon was a one-off. 'The new fuelling station at Heathrow is now operational and the taxis have today been fuelled and driven into central London to pick up the Olympic VIPs, as part of a three-year project to develop hydrogen technology.' The Government-run Technology Strategy Board said the scheme was aimed at demonstrating that hydrogen-fuelled low-emission vehicles could be used more widely in future. Richard Kemp-Harper, the lead technologist looking at transport and energy for the board, said the fuelling difficulties were 'short term'. 'The benefits for those taxis - apart from showing off some great British technology to the rest of the world - is actually that they produce water out of their tail pipes,' he added. Out of the way: The taxis were refuelled at the nearest available station, based at car manufacturer Honda's Swindon plant (pictured) 'So the particulates and air quality - it's a big difference for London even if there's a small carbon problem with having to ship them up to Swindon to pick up hydrogen at the moment.' At the taxi scheme's launch last month, London's Deputy Mayor Kit Malthouse said: 'London’s hydrogen economy is bounding ahead. 'The HYTEC project has been a terrific success, and it provides great lessons for others to get ahead in the most exciting new industry of the 21st century.' The station at the South Marston plant in Swindon is operated by industrial gases group BOC.","Hydrogen-fuelled cabs taken from London to Swindon .

A Brazilian nurse who was caught on camera repeatedly attacking a dog, which later died of its injuries, has gone into hiding after the video was published on YouTube. The disturbing video of Camila de Moura abusing the Yorkshire Terrier in front of her 18-month-old daughter was taken by a neighbour living in the same apartment block in Formosa, Brazil. She originally handed it over to the local police, but posted it online after becoming frustrated that the authorities had not arrested de Moura and were not going to pursue the case. Scroll down for video - warning graphic content . Cruel: In the video nurse Camila de Moura is shown picking the Yorkshire Terrier up by its neck and flinging it across the floor . Terror: By the end of the attack, the dog was cowering in the corner behind its basket, shaking and looking like it had been covered in liquid . After a national outcry, an investigation was quickly launched, and hundreds of thousands have joined Facebook groups or signed an online petition demanding that the 22-year-old be brought to justice. When officers arrived at de Moura's home she reportedly tried to explain her actions by saying she was ‘having a bad day, going through some family problems and an attack of nerves.’ Irresponsible: She repeatedly hit the dog on the head in front of her 18-month-old daughter who stood watching the abuse . The dog was found in a poor state and died of its injuries two days later. De . Moura, who is married to a doctor, has gone into hiding after receiving . more than 40,000 death threats, according to her lawyer Gilson Afonso . Saad. He told Brazil's . Correio Braziliense newspaper: 'It's humanly impossible for her to . remain in her home. Her apartment block was surrounded by a mob throwing . stones. There have even been people offering money for someone to kill . her. Hidden: A bucket was placed over the dog several times during the video . 'The situation has got out of control. The threats aren't restricted to her, but also affect her husband and daughter.' A . police spokesman said the investigation is expected to conclude on .

The elderly heiress whose money and how it was spent is the main focus of the John Edwards trial had a huge crush on him and would be 'euphoric' whenever the former senator was around, a friend testified. Bryan Huffman, an interior designer who became one of Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon's closest confidants, took to the stand yesterday at the Greensboro Court House in North Carolina. Reiterating what other witnesses have said about the now 101-year-old millionaire, Mr Huffman told the jury: 'She liked how he looked, what he espoused and what good he could do for the country.' She first met Edwards in 2004 and was said to have been in love with him ever since. Better today: Edwards was joined by his eldest daughter Cate as they headed into the trial on Thursday, just one day after she left the court in tears . Benefactor: Paul and Bunny Mellon stand with horse sculpture at Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, Virginia, circa 1987. Bunny is now blind and a recluse . Heiress: Bunny Mellon, right, is one of the . wealthy donors who allegedly provided Edwards with almost $1million to . cover up his affair . Mr Huffman is one of the people who is believed to have helped hide the huge campaign donations from Bunny that were allegedly used to hide his affair with Rielle Hunter and subsequent love child. Edwards' attorneys have said he didn't know about the money and Edwards has . pleaded not guilty to six counts related to campaign-finance violations. He faces up to 30 years in prison and $1.5million in fines. The 48-year-old recounted what Bunny said after a December 2005 . meeting with Edwards at her 4,000-acre estate: 'There goes the next president of the . United States.' He testified that she was more than happy to pay for personal expenses for Edwards after the controversy about his expensive haircut in 2007. 'The campaign gave [Mellon] a wonderful . focus and something to hold on to,' Mr Huffman said. Every phone call from . Edwards 'always made her extremely happy'. 'She was having fun with this,' he added. But there was one thing clear about Edwards' visits to her sprawling estate - he was not allowed to bring his wife Elizabeth, who Mr Huffman said she hated. 'Unless Mrs Edwards could come then Mr Edwards couldn’t come,' Huffman recalled. The now blind and reclusive Bunny told Newsweek in an interview last year: 'John had a hard time with Elizabeth.' Her lawyer Alex Forger added his client 'was not enamored of his wife and didn’t want his wife to know that he was getting money.' In stride: Yesterday's witness told how Edwards (right) denied having a relationship with 'crazy' Hunter but Hunter told the aide directly that she and the then-Senator 'were very much in love' Another former close aide to John . Edwards also testified yesterday about bungled efforts to keep the . former presidential candidate's affair hidden from staff members, . including an awkward confirmation of his suspicions from the mistress herself. Mr Davis, who traveled with Edwards . in 2006 and 2007 as a body man, is one of several former aides who have . testified about their suspicion or knowledge of the affair during . Edwards' campaign finance corruption trial. Ms . Hunter's contract with the staff wasn't renewed at the end of 2006, but . Mr Davis hadn't seen the last of her. He testified that in February . 2007, he ran into her in an elevator at the candidate's Detroit hotel. ‘We exchanged brief pleasantries. I would have preferred not to have seen her,’ he said. When he saw that she pushed the button . for Edwards' floor – where Davis also had his room – he stopped on . another floor just so he could get into a different elevator car. Shortly after, he was on the phone with his wife to express his shock at . seeing Ms Hunter. Possible defence witness: Rielle Hunter, the . former mistress of John Edwards, enters the federal courthouse in . Raleigh, North Carolina, Thursday, August 6, 2009 with the pair's child . Frances Quinn Hunter . He heard a knock at the door of his room. It was the mistress, who came in to talk. ‘She told me that she and Senator Edwards were very much in love. And that he was concerned that I had seen her,’ Mr Davis said. The next day, Edwards called Davis into his room and denied that he was having an affair with Hunter. ‘He . told me she was crazy and that we should make sure she didn't talk to . him,’ Mr Davis said, adding that he was satisfied with his boss's . explanation. Mr Davis is the latest in a string of . witnesses who have been brought by the prosecution to detail the steps . that the campaign staff took to keep Edwards’ bid for the presidency, . and then the vice presidency, leading up to Barack Obama’s victory in . 2008. In the Greensboro, . North Carolina court room on Thursday, Mr Davis told how staffers like . himself had growing concerns when they noticed how close Ms Hunter and . Edwards became after she was hired as a videographer for the campaign in . 2006. Disgraced: Edwards could face 30 years in prison and a $1.5million fine if found guilty . 'Sexually voracious': Before she was known as . John Edwards' mistress, Rielle Hunter dated an author who based a 'coke . addled' and 'sexually voracious' character on her . For example, while other staff members called him ‘Senator Edwards,’ Rielle Hunter called him ‘Johnny’ or ‘John’. Not long after Mr Davis' elevator run in with Ms Hunter, a change was made in hotel arrangements that struck Mr Davis as odd. 'Can people tell that you're showing?' -Former Edwards aide John Davis said he heard the then-candidate ask Rielle Hunter . Mr . Davis said he'd always stayed in a room close to the candidate, but . that the staff began staying on a different floor than the candidate . during trips. ‘Mr Edwards suggested maybe a little separation would be good,’ he said. His . most explosive revelation was what he heard when he went to Edwards' hotel room to retrieve a cell phone that the candidate had borrowed from . him. When he got to the . room, he could hear what sounded like a speakerphone conversation . through the door, and he was able to discern both Edwards and Ms . Hunter's voices, and he heard Edwards inquire about how far along Ms . Hunter was in her pregnancy. ‘I heard him ask Rielle if she was showing yet,’ Mr Davis said of the September 2007 incident. 'Can people tell that you're showing?' Mr Davis said Edwards asked. Indiscreet: The court has heard specific details about the cover-up, like how Rielle would demand to be flown on private . jets with Edwards and that he was often seen wheeling around her . luggage . Ms Hunter gave birth to Edwards’ daughter . Frances Quinn in February 2008, and given the date of the phone call, . that would have made Ms Hunter about four months pregnant at the time. ‘Rielle is a very unique personality,’ Mr Davis said in court on Thursday. ‘Everyone else on the team had a . political background. Rielle didn't have that sort of resume. She talked . a lot about meditation and yogis’ Though the details of Ms Hunter-spottings add to the intrigue level about the illicit affair, the most emotional day of testimony surely came yesterday, when Edwards’ daughter Cate left the courtroom crying. Former Edwards aide Christina Reynolds was testifying about an argument Elizabeth Edwards had with her husband on the day in October 2007 that a tabloid published a story about his affair. As Ms Reynolds was beginning the account about what happened at the Raleigh airport, Edwards turned to his daughter Cate, who was seated in the front row. 'I don't know what's coming. Do you want to leave?' Edwards was heard asking. She responded inaudibly to him, then walked away wiping tears. Edwards was heard saying, 'Cate, Cate' as she walked out. Cate Edwards later returned to court after a recess. Ms Reynolds testified, she observed a very upset Elizabeth Edwards confront her husband at Raleigh-Durham International Airport on the morning that The National Enquirer published a story about the affair. Carrying on: John Edwards (right) heads into . court Tuesday with his daughter Cate (center) as the damaging testimony . continued about his affair and ensuing cover up with Rielle Hunter . Upset: Cate Edwards, pictured with her father Tuesday, ran out of the court room in tears Wednesday when she heard stories about her parent's fighting . She stormed off and then collapsed in the parking lot, Ms Reynolds said, and the aide and another staff member helped her into the bathroom of a private hangar. After collecting herself, Elizabeth Edwards came back into the hangar, found her husband and began yelling. She then pulled off her shirt and bra, leaving herself bare-chested, Reynolds said. 'You don't see me any more,' Reynolds quoted the wife as saying. Testimony will continue tomorrow as the trial ends the second of what is expected to be six weeks of hearings.","Bunny Mellon's interior designer said she was in love with Edwards .

A suspect in the murder of businessman Neil Heywood struck a bizarre deal to import giant helium balloons to China in a bid to smuggle money into Britain, it was claimed yesterday. Politician’s wife Gu Kailai asked a  British firm to accept a secret £150,000 over-payment and to use the money to pay her son’s school fees at Harrow, a former company director said. When the firm refused, the lawyer lost her temper and threatened to have its bosses thrown into jail by her powerful husband if they ever set foot in China. 'Money-laundering' bid: Gu Kailai (left), accused of murdering British expat Neil Heywood (right), reportedly tried to covertly transfer £200,000 into Britain to pay for her son's education through a strange hot-air balloon deal . Murky dealings: Mrs Gu with husband Bo Xilai, the purged Communist leader of Chongqinq, and their son Bo Guagua. It is claimed Mrs Gu wanted to use the £200,000 to fund Guagua's public schooling in the UK . Mrs Gu, 53, is in custody in China . where she has been named as a suspect in the murder of Old Harrovian Mr . Heywood, and she and husband Bo Xilai are at the centre of a corruption . investigation. Reports in China claim the 41-year-old . British expat was poisoned with cyanide after he threatened to expose . Mrs Gu for illegally siphoning a vast fortune out the country, while her . husband was a rising star in the ruling Communist Party. The case has prompted a political . scandal in China and caused international embarrassment when Britain . demanded a full investigation into Mr Heywood’s death. It was reported at the weekend that . Chinese authorities are expected to release a confession from Mrs Gu in . an attempt to end the humiliating scandal. Career in ruins: Mr Bo, who was suspended from the Politburo after the scandal surrounding Mr Heywood's death broke, pictured with his son, Bo Guagua . Further evidence of Neil Heywood's strong links with Gu Kailai has emerged, of all places, in an Edwardian mansion block where Princess Diana, right, once lived. A £1.5million apartment in Coleherne Court, a block of more than 200 properties on the border of Earl's Court and South Kensington in London, is reportedly owned by Mrs Gu. According to The Sunday Times, neighbours say Harrow-educated Mr Heywood acted as keyholder for the two-bedroom flat on her behalf. Reports that Mrs Gu had become Mr Heywood's mistress have been denied, but their involvement together at Coleherne Court will fuel speculation about just how far their business dealings went. It has been alleged that Mrs Gu ordered the murder of Mr Heywood because he was threatening to reveal her overseas dealings, which involved her trying to move large amounts of money out of China through him. Princess Diana lived at Coleherne Court before marrying Prince Charles. Company director Giles Hall told how . Mrs Gu approached his firm, Vistarama, in 1998, when it ran the . Bournemouth Eye, a tethered balloon which offered views from 500ft above . the seaside town. Mrs Gu said she was married to Bo . Xilai, then mayor of Dalian, and she wanted the city to have a similar . balloon. As talks progressed she discussed importing hundreds of . tethered balloons to China. She was accompanied by Frenchman . Patrick Devillers, her business partner, and occasionally by Mr Heywood, . a consultant who was mentoring her son, Bo Guagua, to help him get a . place at Harrow. Mr Hall said: ‘She was a very cold, hard woman. 'It was . always apparent that she wanted things to be done quietly and secretly, . and we had to sign a confidentiality agreement, which seemed bizarre. ‘Patrick said later that we would get . our fingers burned if we were indiscreet. 'He said it was best just to do . the deal and not to ask too many questions about where the money came . from.’ The tethered balloon deal for Dalian . went ahead, but Mr Hall said payments came from a variety of sources, . including the Dalian Free Trade Zone, private companies and Gu’s account . with Coutts, the Queen’s banker. 'Admission': Chinese authorities are expected to release a formal confession from Mrs Gu to the murder of Mr Heywood at the Nanshan Lijing Holiday Hotel (above) in Chongqing last November . A senior US diplomat arrived in China last night on an emergency mission to calm rising tensions between the two superpowers. Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell landed amid a diplomatic storm between Beijing and Washington after blind  dissident Chen Guangcheng made a dramatic escape to reach the US Embassy and ask for asylum. Beijing has yet to react to the embarrassing flight of Chen, 40, from putative house arrest last week. Instead, the government has ordered a media blackout and shut down all blogs and internet search engine references to Chen’s escape. Chen has made a video addressed to China’s Premier, Wen Jiabao, pleading with him to arrest the officials who beat and tortured him. He also feared ‘insane retribution’ on his family and supporters, including his mother, wife and young daughter. His escape comes just two months after the senior police chief who exposed Briton Neil Heywood’s murder, Wang Lijun, fled to a US consulate to seek asylum.The Mail understands Mr Campbell’s arrival is part of an attempt to appease the Chinese by offering Chen passage to the US on medical grounds. He told how Mrs Gu offered to make a . £150,000 ‘extra payment’ on an air freight charge for a winch they . needed for the  Dalian balloon. ‘She said, “We have to get Bo Guagua . into Harrow and we need you to pay the fees”. 'I said we couldn’t afford . to do that and she said, “No, we pay. We pay the company, you pay the . school”.’ Mr Hall said his deal with Mrs Gu . soured when the winch could not be shipped to Dalian and had to go via . Beijing. He added: ‘By the end, it was very apparent that there was . corruption involved. She didn’t have to worry as long as everything went . through Dalian, where her husband was in control. ‘When the winch was sent to Beijing, . she was furious. 'She said if any of us turned up in China she would get . us locked up. Plainly she had the means to do it. 'In Dalian they were . all-powerful. 'Everyone was scared to death of her there.’ It was also reported at the weekend . that Dr Andrew Jackson, a London coroner, could ask Justice Secretary . Kenneth Clarke to allow him to hold an inquest into Mr Heywood’s death. That would pave the way for Scotland Yard to be called in.","Gu Kailai struck deal with British firm to import giant balloon to China .

A young couple who were in effect tried and cleared twice of shaking their baby son to death called last night for an inquiry into their ‘agonising’ treatment at the hands of social services, the NHS and the police. Rohan Wray and Chana Al-Alas were accused of killing four-month-old Jayden, who died of severe head  injuries. While awaiting trial, they lost custody of the little boy’s younger  sister, Jayda. They were cleared of all criminal charges when it emerged their son had been suffering from rickets which causes weak bones and could explain his injuries. Success: Chana Al-Alas and Rohan Wray (pictured) have won a High Court battle to prove their innocence over the death of their baby son . Charges of murder and causing or allowing Jayden's (pictured) death were dropped following a six-week trial . However, their local council refused to return Jayda to her parents because it remained convinced they may have been responsible for her brother’s death. The couple then endured a four-week hearing at the High Court during which the same accusations were levelled at them. Yesterday, in a landmark judgment, they were cleared for a second time, and later they spoke bitterly of their treatment. Mr Wray, 22, said: ‘There are medical staff who we believe should be disciplined at an inquiry. I think these medical experts who judge parents are dangerous people. They base much of what they say on opinion rather than fact.’ His partner Miss Al-Alas, 19, added: ‘The doctors and the police made allegations against us without any real proof, then they acted on these allegations.’ Their nightmare began in July 2009 when Jayden, their first child, began suffering seizures and refusing to feed. Doctors failed to identify that he had rickets and his condition continued to deteriorate. He died at Great Ormond Street hospital in London. After he was found to have multiple fractures and severe brain damage, his parents, from Islington, North London, were charged with murder and causing or allowing Jayden’s death. Jayda was born in October 2010 and was immediately taken from the couple. In December 2011 an Old Bailey judge ordered not guilty verdicts to be returned because there was insufficient evidence to convict after more than 60 prosecution and defence medical experts had failed to agree on a cause of death. The court heard that Miss Al-Alas suffered from a severe vitamin D deficiency that would have been passed to Jayden, causing injuries that led to his death. 'A very much wanted baby': Chana cuddles Jayden when he was two months old . But Islington Council remained concerned for Jayda’s safety  and, because the couple had not been acquitted by a jury, chose to stage in effect a re-run of the criminal case. Handing down her judgment yesterday, Mrs Justice Theis paid tribute to Jayden’s parents, saying: ‘Despite the parents’ youth and the fact the pregnancy was unplanned, Jayden was very much a wanted baby.’ Sitting at the High Court’s family division in London, she said the case against the pair was not proved and called for more research into vitamin D deficiency and its effects on young children. She said: ‘The issues surrounding vitamin D deficiency have dominated this hearing. ‘Evidence has been given that it is on the increase, leading possibly to an increase in congenital rickets. ‘The identification of it is not easily done, as this case so graphically demonstrated.’ The disease, which was discovered at Jayden’s post mortem, weakens the skulls of children and causes their bones to break easily – symptoms which closely  mimic those of a deliberately shaken baby. Mr Wray said: ‘We feel we were treated very poorly by the state authorities involved in investigating our case. We were viewed as guilty from the outset. ‘They went down the line that we had done this to our son by shaking him. ‘If the doctors had found the rickets problem, we feel our son could still be alive today. But our agony at losing Jayden was exacerbated when we were accused of killing him.’ Police refused to let the couple or their family attend Jayden’s christening, which they requested before his life support machine was switched off. Victory after agony: Rohan and Chana pose after their High Court victory . They were not allowed into the paediatric intensive care ward to see him when he died. But the parents said the most heartbreaking moment of their ordeal was when their newborn daughter was taken from them. Mr . Wray said: ‘Since the Baby P tragedy social workers, the police and . doctors have become over-keen to snatch children from innocent parents. ‘We feel that they should look more closely at the facts of each case before pointing the finger of blame.’ Ann Thompson of law firm Goodman Ray, representing Miss Al-Alas, said: ‘Nothing is as sad as the death of a child. ‘But for these parents, the nightmare went on and on. ‘It was compounded by the criminal investigation and then the loss of their daughter without being able to bond with her. ‘They are delighted and relieved that they can finally be allowed to grieve for their son and be reunited with their daughter.’ Islington Council declined  to comment.","They first walked free in December last year after being cleared of killing four-month-old Jayden .

Pilots were forced to ground the craft - an Embraer 190 - after hitting the birds shortly after takeoff at 6.45pm. The bird strike is the second to ground a New York flight in less than a week, after a Delta plane was forced to turn back to JFK Airport last Thursday. Bird attack: The JetBlue plane was forced into an emergency landing just 7 minutes after takeoff after two geese smacked into the windshield . A spokeswoman for JetBlue said the affected plane was flight 571 to West Palm Beach, which had 54 passengers and four crew members on board. One of the pilots radioed controllers immediately after hitting the birds, saying, 'We got to come back. We hit two big geese. We are declaring an emergency.' The plane travelled just six miles from the airport before turning back, and passengers found themselves back on the tarmac a mere seven minutes after leaving it. Nobody was injured as a result of the incident, but the weighty birds were less lucky: Their remains could be seen on the jet's windshield, which was damaged in the impact. The JetBlue flight was forced to make an emergency landing at Westchester Airport, outside of New York City . The plane had travelled just six miles when it was forced to land.

New fathers could take up to six months of paid leave from work under controversial plans  at the heart of the Queen’s Speech yesterday. Ministers said proposals were chiefly designed to make Britain more business-friendly and boost the economy, with measures to rein in a £1billion-a-year employment tribunal bonanza, reform the banking sector and lift red tape on firms. But legislation to revolutionise the workplace by introducing flexible parental leave by 2015 dismayed some business leaders, who said it would be a ‘nightmare’ to administer. Power of paternity: New fathers could take up to six months of paid leave from work under controversial plans at the heart of the Queen's Speech yesterday . Queen Elizabeth announced yesterday that new fathers could take up to six months of paid leave from work under controversial plans . Critics said the Coalition’s programme, details of which were delivered by the Queen in little more than eight minutes, was not radical enough given the economic emergency facing Britain following the economy’s slump into a double-dip recession. The Confederation of British Industry said the ‘jury was out’ on the Government’s flagship proposals to repeal unnecessary regulation on business and limit state inspections of firms. Aspirational: David Cameron hopes the legislation will smash the traditional assumption that it is the mother who should take time off work to care for a new child . Other key measures included: . ■ . A new flat-rate state pension, to be worth £155 a week, to be . introduced in the most far-reaching reform of the system for a century . ■ Forcing banks to ring-fence risky investment activities from their retail arms . ■ New powers for company shareholders to rein in fat cat pay . ■ Rights for fathers to maintain ‘meaningful’ relationships with children after a separation and moves to speed up adoption . ■ A new offence of drug driving and a National Crime Agency to tackle organised crime and border security . The plans threatened to be . overshadowed, however, by a row over House of Lords reform, which was . included in the programme but is fiercely opposed by many Conservative . MPs. The Prime Minister told the Daily . Mail that he was determined the Government would not get ‘bogged down’ in the issue and suggested a referendum might be held if MPs determine . one is necessary. David . Cameron sought to calm his Right-wing MPs – who agreed in a private . meeting of the backbench 1922 committee last night that criticism of the . party leadership had gone too far and should be tempered – by shelving . plans on overseas aid and gay marriage. Should fathers have the right to six months' paternity leave? But . proposals for flexible parental leave, championed by Deputy Prime . Minister Nick Clegg, were included, despite business warnings that it . will be a bureaucratic disaster if mothers and fathers are able to take . their leave in ‘chunks’ of a few weeks or months at a time. The . legislation is designed to smash the traditional assumption that it is . the mother who should take time off work to care for a new child. Ministers say the measures will offer . more flexibility to modern families where women are as likely as men to . be the main breadwinner, and allow fathers to spend more time with . their children. The Queen arrives by royal carriage at parliament for the State Opening of Parliament in London . Under existing rules, mothers are . entitled to take 12 months maternity leave, of which nine months is . paid. Fathers can take two weeks paid paternity leave. A consultation launched by ministers . last year proposed that mothers will automatically have five months paid . maternity leave, along with six weeks paid paternity leave for their . partners. The couple . will then be allowed to divide up a further seven months of parental . leave between them. All but the last three months will be paid at the . statutory minimum of £128.73. This . means that in cases where the mother chooses to go back to work after . five months, the father could take up to eight-and-a-half months off – . six months of which would be paid. Alternatively, . new parents could opt to take more than six months off at the same time . – doubling the disruption in cases where a firm employs them both. Employers . will be forced to keep their jobs open and would not be able to refuse . requests for the time off. The extra four weeks paternity leave would be . given to men who would be urged to ‘use it or lose it’.

According to the Halifax Price Index, the average home now costs £159,883, down 2.4% per cent from £163,796 in March - the same level as in 2004.

House prices have now fallen 11.8 per cent since they reached their peak in October 2007. The figure is a UK average which does not take into account regional fluctuations. In April 2010, as the property market hit a high point following its bounce back from the 2008/9 slump, the average price of a UK property was £168,593, Halifax says.

And Nationwide warned that house prices, which on average were also 0.9 per cent down on April last year, were set to stagnate or fall throughout 2012, as households' confidence lagged behind any possible economic recovery.

Ed Miliband yesterday called for new laws to protect members of the Armed Forces from discrimination as he visited British troops in Afghanistan. The Labour leader also called for the international community to ‘up its game’ on political progress in Afghanistan – or risk wasting a decade of sacrifice by British soldiers. He said that reports last week that soldiers had been turned away from a pub in Blackpool by bouncers saying ‘no Army here’ highlighted the barriers they faced.

Mr Miliband said: ‘I think it is wrong that any of our troops face discrimination, disadvantage or unfair treatment because they have served in the military or because they are serving. ‘I want cross-party talks, I want to work with the military charities, to say, “How can we really resolve this issue?” ’ After flying into Camp Bastion, the Armed Forces’ main base in southern Helmand, Mr Miliband and Shadow Defence Secretary Jim Murphy visited  a memorial to fallen British troops at a patrol base in the Nahr-e Saraj district. Mr Miliband denied his trip was a PR stunt. ‘My purpose for being here is to express the deep sense of gratitude I have for our troops,’ he said. Fry-up: Ed Miliband enjoys a full English breakfast with British troops at Camp Bastion . Hungry: The Labour leader helps himself to the breakfast buffet . He expressed fears that the country would slip back into being a failed state when combat troops are withdrawn in 2014, during a visit to the capital Kabul for talks with president Hamid Karzai. He flew in after visiting troops serving in southern Helmand, where he expressed surprise at the level of progress being made in training the Afghan security forces ahead of the international pullout. Despite giving his backing to the planned withdrawal date - reaffirmed at last weekend's Nato summit in Chicago - and to Prime Minister David Cameron's approach, he said there was 'a long way to go'. In an address to troops at the end of a tour of British bases yesterday, Mr Miliband told a gathering of troops that political failure must not be allowed to undermine their 'extraordinary' efforts. A total of 414 members of UK forces have died since operations in Afghanistan began in October 2001. Speaking at the British Embassy ahead of talks with Mr Karzai - as well as senior ministers and opposition leader Abdullah Abdullah - he said: 'It is incredibly eye-opening coming out and actually seeing what they are doing, throwing themselves in harm's way, every day going out on patrol.

'Seeing it up close, with people who are young enough to be my son or daughter doing that, is incredibly humbling. 'I think the best way we can honour the sacrifices our troops have been making is to make sure that they have the best support when they come back home. 'But also, the international community needs to up its game in getting a lasting political settlement here in Afghanistan because I think that is necessary in order to prevent Afghanistan slipping back into being a failed state and there is a lot more work to do to make that happen.' He continued: 'In this final phase it is very important that we don't take our eye off the ball. I do not think the Government is, I am not criticising the Government. 'The Prime Minister is right to set a timetable. I think we should stick to the timetable. 'We have invested a lot. Many of our troops have made huge sacrifices, including the ultimate sacrifice.

He said it would be wrong for anyone - including those who opposed the campaign in the first place - to argue for the troops to be pulled out before 2014, despite increased public hostility to the war. French president Francois Hollande was in Kabul for talks with Mr Karzai while the Labour leader - who is an ally of the newly-elected Socialist - was in Helmand, to explain his decision to accelerate France's pullout. Mr Miliband said: 'President Hollande has to make his own decisions. 'What is interesting about Afghanistan is that whether you were for the mission originally or against the mission, to suddenly up sticks now would not be the right thing to do.'

After flying in to Camp Bastion, the UK's main base in southern Helmand, Mr Miliband started the day by chatting with soldiers over a full English breakfast. Under a hot sun, he then headed to provincial capital Lashkar Gah to talk about the progress of Afghan control with the commander of the Helmand task force Brigadier Doug Chalmers. A moment of reflection followed as he stopped, flanked by shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander, before a memorial to some of the fallen British troops at a patrol base in Nahr-e Saraj district. The pause to remember the dead was made more poignant by the flag of The Yorkshire Regiment, fluttering at half mast in honour of the six men - five from the regiment's 3rd Battalion - lost when their Warrior armoured vehicle was blown up by a massive improvised explosive device on March 6. Some of their comrades were on hand to show the politicians the range of hardware used by British forces in the field - from Mastiff armoured personnel carriers to medical kits and search dogs. One dog, named Benny, was put through his paces as the politicians looked on, a little unsure of the canine member of the crew, one military chief joking: 'You're all eight to ten inches away from a 'reshuffle' there!'. All three of the districts where the UK is involved have now been transferred to Afghan control - with some troops telling Mr Miliband their local counterparts have become 10 times more efficient within just a couple of years. The transition process is due to be complete across Afghanistan by the middle of next year ahead of the 2014 Nato pullout deadline. Talking with an Afghan colonel, Mr Miliband praised the 'tremendous strides forward'.","Labour leader arrived in the capital Kabul ahead of talks with president Hamid Karzai .

Britain is now a cleaner country thanks to the army of volunteers who have hit the streets in a mass spruce-up for the Diamond Jubilee. In an extraordinary response to this newspaper’s anti-litter campaign, more than 25,000 people from all walks of life pulled together to make sure the country looks its best this weekend. Those signing up to the Daily Mail’s Spring Clean for the Queen campaign included everyone from fast food and supermarket workers to company chief executives and Rotary Club members. Some volunteers, such as those pictured here cleaning up in Birmingham, even donned Royal face masks for the occasion . Scores of Britain’s biggest firms backed the campaign, with Tesco, Lloyds TSB and Marks & Spencer organising mass clean-ups for thousands of employees. Environment charities have praised the success of the Mail’s campaign, which was set up only four weeks ago in response to the litter strewn across our parks, pavements and waterways. John Read, of campaign group Clean Up Britain, said: ‘The Daily Mail’s campaign has had a tremendously positive impact in galvanising people all over the country to get out there, clean up Britain, and pick up litter that’s scarring their local communities.

It’s been the most high-profile litter campaign for a long time. Well done, everyone.’ Efforts were stepped up in the week before the Jubilee, with 500 shop workers blitzing Oxford Circus in the West End on Wednesday. The workers, from stores including Debenhams, Gap and House of Fraser, picked up 1,400 pieces of gum during an hour-long clean. The coffee shops were also doing their bit, with bosses at Starbucks and Caffe Nero joining baristas in litter picks in London last week. Mayor of London Boris Johnson said: ‘Congratulations to the many community-minded volunteers and organisations who are pulling together to spruce up London ahead of the Diamond Jubilee, during what is undoubtedly one of the most exciting and inspiring years in this great city’s history.’","More than 25,000 people from all walks of life took part to ensure Britain looks its best for the Queen's special occasion this weekend .

Pro-tobacco activists have been accused of harassing and threatening to kill health experts and anti-smoking campaigners -  as the government considers banning branding on cigarette packets. The number of online attacks and hate campaigns has risen sharply, since the coalition began consulting experts about plain containers. Some websites have even called on followers to 'shoot' anti-smoking campaigners, listing businessman and Dragon's Den star Duncan Bannatyne among a list of targets. Mr Bannatyne, a former smoker, was named in an blog in March, alongside staff of Action and Smoking and Health (ASH) and Cancer Research UK. The article on freedom-2-choose.blogspot.co.uk also revealed the address of Ash's offices in London, Cardiff and Edinburgh, prompting staff to contact the police.It . It said: 'Snipers could soon snuff out . prohibitionists ... It is time the humble smoker fought back against . this intolerable persecution, for persecution is exactly what it is.' The website - which isn't connected to the campaign group Freedom2Choose - has since removed the article, claiming it was intended to be satirical. But those in favour of harsher regulation on tobacco products say it's not an isolated incident. Bath University has been forced to increase security for its tobacco control research group after staff began receiving threatening phone calls and emails. Group director Anna Gilmore says she received seven calls a day for two months after publishing an article about the illegal trade in smokeless tobacco. Conflict: The government is considering banning all branding on cigarette packets - angering smokers . Mrs Gilmore told The Guardian: 'The ones I answered were intimidatory; the tone was aggressive. Many of my team felt threatened and worried by this.' 'We've had abuse before, over the debate about banning smoking in public places, and I get some of this every time I publish a paper, but it's increasing...This is part of a deliberate attempt to misinform the public and politicians, denigrate our research and to harass, denigrate and undermine us as researchers.' When Stirling University's Linda Bauld published the paper that led to the Government consultation on plain packaging - she was bombarded with abuse. A pro-smoking blogger calling himself Frank Davis told her: 'You should start worrying when bricks start getting thrown through your window or messages daubed on your door.' He added that she should emigrate so she would be elsewhere 'when your old university department gets torched and your old colleagues are strung up from lamp-posts.' And said of Ash director Deborah Arnott: 'I'd have had a hard time preventing . myself from strangling Arnott on the spot and on camera, or bludgeoning . her to death with a microphone stand.' Liberal Democrat MP Stephen Williams, chair of Westminster's all party parliamentary group on smoking and health, has also been subjected to online abuse since he spoke out in favour of plain cigarette packs. Simon Clark, director of Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking (Forest), has distanced the group from the online abuse. He said smokers had felt disenfranchised since the UK-wide ban on smoking in public places, but condemned the threats of violence.","Smokers encouraged to 'shoot' targets including anti-smoking campaigner Duncan Bannatyne .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:23 EST, 22 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:17 EST, 23 May 2012 . Protesters have today defaced a controversial painting that draws attention to South African President Jacob Zuma's genitals and his reputation for promiscuity. Two men wielding cans of red and black paint walked into Johannesburg's Goodman gallery and daubed an X over the president's groin before smearing paint over his face. The painting by Brett Murray entitled 'The Spear' has been on display since early this month, but made the news only last week when it came to the attention of South Africa's governing African National Congress party. X marks the spot: A protester is caught on CCTV defacing the controversial portrait of South African Jacob Zuma at a Johannesburg gallery . Zuma filed an urgent application at the South Gauteng High Court for an order to have the portrait removed from the gallery and photographs of it taken off the City Press newspaper website. Both the gallery and the newspaper refused on the grounds it would be censorship. The matter was set to be heard today. Zuma claims portrait, which shows him fully clothed but with his genitals exposed, infringed on his constitutional rights to dignity and privacy. Zuma said he felt 'shocked, personally offended and violated' when he saw a copy of The Spear for the first time. He said the portrait depicted him as a 'a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect'. Polygamist: ANC leader Zuma is seen with three of his four wives Sizakele Khumalo (right) Nompumelo Ntuli (Left) and Thobeka Mabhija (centre) Iman Rappetti, a reporter for a South African TV channel who was in the Goodman Gallery when the men struck, said: 'Now it's completely and utterly destroyed.' Her channel showed footage of a man in a suit painting a red X over the president's genital area and then his face. Next a man in a hoodie used his hands to rubbed black paint over the president's face and down the painting. Rapetti said the men were detained by gallery staff and police arrived later to take them away. Rappetti said she initially thought the first man was part of a performance art piece, and that staff at the well-known gallery also were slow to react. The Goodman, which had said in a statement a day earlier that it was stepping up security, refused to comment Tuesday and closed the gallery as reporters and passers-by gathered outside its gate. The gallery's attorney, Greg Palmer, said they are going to file a charge for malicious damage to property. He said they did not know who the two men were who defaced the painting. 'The gallery has closed and they feel that their security is sufficient,' he said. Judge Fayeeza Kathree-Setiloane had been expected to begin hearing the case against the painting Tuesday. Instead, citing its national interest and the constitutional issues at stake, she said the case would start Thursday. Kathree-Setiloane and two other High Court judges, among the most senior in South Africa, will hear the case. Nearly one hundred pro-Zuma protesters were outside the court. Zuma's children asked to participate on the side of their father. Murray, the artist who painted the portrait, asked to participate alongside the Goodman. Protest: Around 100 Jacob Zuma supporters demonstrate outside Johannesburg court to demand the removal of a portrait . Speaking to the Pretoria News, Murray said he did not intend to cause any 'hurt or to harm the dignity of any person' and described his work as 'an attempt at humorous satire of political power and patriarchy within the context of other artworks in the exhibition and within the broader context of South African discourse'. The painting, a black, red and yellow acrylic on canvas priced at 120,000 rand (about $15,000), is in the style of a famous image of founder of Russian communism Lenin is part of a large exhibition of Murray's sculptures and paintings titled 'Hail to the Thief II.' The ANC has called the show an 'abuse of freedom of artistic expression.' Polygamist Mr Zuma, 70, has married six times. He currently has four wives having divorced South African cabinet minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma in 1999. Another wife, Kate Mantsho-Zuma, committed suicide in 2000. In 2006 he sparked outrage while on trial for rape when he said he had showered after having unprotected sex with an HIV-positive woman, thinking this would reduce his risk of being infected. He told the court he was prepared to marry his accuser and was later found not guilty.","Polygamist Zuma has married six times and has a reputation for promiscuity .

A . used-car salesman has been found guilty of murdering his estranged wife, . their young son and his father-in-law by setting fire to their family . home after his marriage collapsed. Danai . Muhammadi, 24, was fuelled by 'spite, anger and resentment' when he . killed Melissa Crook, 20, and their 15-month-old son Noah by torching . the house in Chatham Hill, Chatham, Kent. Mrs . Crook’s father Mark Crook, 49, was left critically ill with severe . burns in hospital following the fire just before 2.30am on September 10 . last year and he died six days later. Melissa Crook and her future killer Danai Muhammadi on their wedding day . Muhammadi . and his friend, bouncer Farhad Mahmud, 35, squirted petrol through the . letter box using a garden spray container, leading to fire breaking out . at the base of the stairs. Mahmud was also found guilty of three counts . of murder. The location of the fire cut off any reasonable means of escape for the family who were asleep upstairs as the blaze took hold. As . smoke and flames filled the three-bedroom terraced house, Mrs Crook . collapsed in an upstairs bedroom and was found dead by firefighters . lying by her son who was wrapped in a quilt. Amid . the chaos, her brother Bohdan jumped out of a front bedroom window, . causing fractures to his feet and hands. He then tried to get back . inside to reach his mother, Amanda, who eventually managed to escape. Her . husband, Mark Crook, meanwhile, tried to flee the building by following . his wife out of an upstairs window on to a flat roof outside. But . 26-stone Mr Crook got stuck in the window frame just as a fireball blew . the windows out. He . suffered 80 per cent burns and was taken to a specialist burns unit in . East Grinstead, West Sussex, where he never regained consciousness in . the intensive care unit. He died six days later. Muhammadi’s . new girlfriend, jobless Emma Smith, 21, was cleared of three counts of . murder and two counts of attempted murder but convicted of three counts . of manslaughter after a six-week trial at Maidstone Crown Court. Muhammadi and Mahmud were also found guilty of two counts of attempted murder. Fire fighters at the scene of the fire at the Crook family home in Chatham, Kent . Muhammadi and Mahmud showed no emotion as they learned of the verdicts flanked by security guards and interpreters. In . the public gallery, survivors Amanda and Bohdan Crook shook visibly and . hugged each other as the jury foreman read out the verdicts in front of . a packed courtroom. As Judge Mr Justice Sweeney said that Muhammadi and Mahmud faced life behind bars, a family member shouted 'good'. The judge told the jury: 'There can be very few criminal cases which are as taxing for a jury than this one must have been. 'I don’t suppose any of us are going to forget some aspects of the evidence we have heard about the fire.' In the weeks before the fire, the court heart how Melissa Crook's relationships with Muhammadi and Smith deteriorated. Smith . had started a relationship with Mrs Crook’s estranged husband, Danai . Muhammadi, and in four-letter text message exchanges she taunted her . about their “great life together”.Smith also mocked Mrs Crook . about her size, for being “boring” in the bedroom and added: “Enjoy your . life with no husband, no house... no money you gold-digger.” Muhammadi . told the court he had a good relationship with his estranged wife, but . it became clear in the trial that he had thoughts of extreme violence. Up . to three months before the fire, he told one workmate he wanted to harm . his estranged wife, telling them he was going to throw acid in her face . to “f*** up her life”. The couple's marriage collapsed after six months amid arguments and emotional conflict involving their son . Amanda Crook, 50, said she felt . “sick” when she learned Danai Muhammadi was suspected of starting the . fire that killed three generations of her family. Mrs . Crook escaped the burning building in Chatham, Kent, along with her . 22-year-old son Bohdan - Melissa’s brother - but both said the end of . the court case would not bring them closure.She said: 'We weren’t . just anyone, we were family, and the fact he (Muhammadi) did it to his . wife and his own child and his father-in-law. 'He’s taken away our whole lives, just because of his greed, and that’s all it was.'It was greed. There was no reason to do what he did.' Speakign . after the guilty verdict, she added: 'The verdict today is not a cause . for celebration for us, the family, but we are relieved that we have at . least received justice. 'The evil people convicted today are now deprived of their liberty, and justly so. 'However, no sentence they received could bring back the loved ones they took from us.' Police . initially had no reason to suspect Muhammadi until they visited him at . his new home in Coventry and discovered, through automatic number plate . recognition technology, that he had driven to Kent and back around the . time of the fire. Mobile phone records later revealed that, in an effort to eliminate himself . from suspicion, Muhammadi texted Mrs Crook at around 11am that morning. He wrote: 'Hi mel, hope you both well. Can I book the hotel for 22 . September. Let me know please. Love you, mate. Give Noah (a) hug and . kiss from me. X.' Prosecutor Mark Dennis QC described . it as a 'cynical and breathtaking attempt' to protect himself from . suspicion of the arson attack he committed just hours earlier. After police discovered he had travelled to Kent, . Muhammadi, who was raised in Iran, was arrested and during a search of . his home, a post-code for a property in Maidstone was found on a scrap . of paper. This led officers to Mahmud - and in the bath of his flat officers found the plant sprayer used to start the fire. Mobile . phone records then proved Smith was in Kent at the fire and had made a . 999 call - between calls to Mahmud and Muhammadi - claiming she had . driven past a burning house. A date for sentencing was provisionally set for the first week in July.","Danai Muhammadi and an accomplice used garden spray to start blaze that killed wife, 20, baby son and father-in-law .

An alleged accomplice to former KGB sex-sting spy Anna Chapman has been arrested in Holland after passing on sensitive German government documents. Identified only as Raymond P., aged 60, the man was targeted by the German Federal Prosecutor's Office. German media reported today he passed on some 450 secret files to a couple linked to Chapman who was expelled from America two years ago. He is now in custody and refusing to speak to investigators. News magazine Focus said the man, a Dutch diplomat, gave the paperwork to a couple arrested in the German university city of Marburg in October last year who belonged to the same espionage network as Chapman and were provided with false identity papers by their Moscow controllers. Chapman became known as the 'sexpot spy' because she used her feminine charms to try to entrap targets and gain vital information from them. Born Anna Vasil’yevna Kushchyenko, Miss Chapman adopted her Anglophone surname after marrying British former public schoolboy Alex Chapman - who she claims to have fallen for because he looked like Liam Gallagher. Chapman became known as the 'sexpot spy' because she used her feminine charms to try to entrap targets and gain vital information from them . In a documentary broadcast in April this year FBI counter-intelligence chief Frank Figliuzzi claimed the glamorous Russian agent got close enough to 'disturb' U.S. spy catchers. He said the fear that Miss Chapman was close to seducing a sitting member of the Obama administration spurred agents to swoop on the 10-strong spy ring of which she was a part. Mr Figliuzzi told the Channel 4 documentary the auburn-haired spy got 'closer and closer to higher and higher ranking leadership... she got close enough to disturb us.' Raymond P., say prosecutors, leaked sensitive documents to Andreas and Heidrun Anschlag in Marburg. Both held Austrian passports but are thought to be South American-born. The couple were both arrested in October last year. It is understood they were turned in to the authorities by the same double agent who last year led the FBI to uncover the Chapman ring of ‘deep cover’ Russian spies in the United States. According to the Moscow Times, the Anschlags maintained contact with the US operatives, including the flame-haired Chapman who has become a TV celebrity following her return to Russia in a spy exchange. Heidrun Anschlag was reportedly listening to encrypted radio messages from Moscow when police commandos entered her home.","Identified only as Raymond P. aged 60, the man was targetted by the German Federal Prosecutor's Office .

Controversial Italian MP Alessandra Mussolini has been slammed for signing images of her fascist dictator grandfather Benito during a corruption debate in parliament. Mrs Mussolini, 49, who is an MP with former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's People of Freedom Party, was spotted by photographers autographing black and white photographs of her grandfather. She had been given the pictures by fellow right wing politician Carolina Lussana in an envelope and asked to sign them for Lussana's friend. Outrage: Alessandra Mussolini is pictured handing over a photo she has just signed of her grandfather fascist dictator Benito to a friend . Controversial: Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, left, giving the straight-arm salute. His granddaughter politician Alessandra, right, has been criticised for signing photographs of the despised leader . One photo reportedly showed Benito Mussolini giving the straight arm Roman salute. Lussana was heard requesting an autograph and for the famous granddaughter to make a dedication. Centre left MPs immediately criticised Mrs Mussolini for her 'offensive actions' with Cesare Damiano of the Democratic Left saying: 'This is really beyond the pale and is unacceptable. 'It is an insult to the democratic institutions of our country.' Unapologetic: Carolina Lusana, pictured right, says she does not understand why Alessandra Mussolini, left, has been criticised for signing a photo of Benito Mussolini . Flavio Arzarello, of the Italian . Communist party, said: 'This episode involving Mussolini and Lussana is . an insult to parliament and to our country.

Miss Lussano, of the anti-immigration Northern League party, said: 'The pictures were for a friend of mine who is very interested in history.

Benito Mussolini's youngest son, jazz player Romano, was the father of Alessandra and the famous actress Sophia Loren is also her aunt. Mussolini was in power from 1922 until 1943 when he was executed after being caught by partisans. His body was hung upside down from a lamp post in Milan. Technically it is against the law to have fascist symbols or memorabilia but there is a ready market in artefacts from the era and Mussolini's grave in Predappio near Forli has become a shrine for neo Fascists.","MP signed one photo showing Mussolini giving straight-arm salute .

The British mother being held in Indonesia on suspicion of drugs trafficking has told how she fears for her six-year-old daughter's life. Rachel Dougall is currently receiving treatment in hospital for stress after collapsing in her jail cell, claiming she hadn't . 'slept or eaten for days'. She has been sedated and is being fed through . a drip. She, along with three other Britons including her partner Julian Ponder, face the death penalty after being arrested on suspicion of trying to smuggle cocaine worth £1.6 million. Despair: Prison officials struggle to take Rachel Dougall, the British . woman held over a £1.6 million cocaine haul, to hospital . Depressed: Dougall was moved to hospital after refusing to eat . and constantly calling out for her six-year-old daughter Kitty . Police . believe Dougall, 38, and Ponder, 43, were the . lynchpins in a crime syndicate supplying the drug to rich tourists on . the Indonesian island of Bali.  If convicted, they could be sentenced to death by firing squad. Dougall's six-year-old daughter Kitty, is currently being cared for by the family's maid and her gardening husband, although Dougall's parents are believed to be flying out from Britain. Speaking from her guarded room at Bali's Trijata Hospital, Dougall appeared frail and confused as she asked if the story was in British newspapers. Bewildered: Six-year-old Kitty Ponder standing with her family's maid Dayu Ariani and her gardening husband Ketut Suranchan . When she was told it was, she said she feared for her daughter Kitty’s life. Propping herself up on her elbow, she said: 'Oh my god, is my daughter safe? 'I am afraid for my daughter's life. ‘I am sick. I am suffering from stress. My mother and father are arriving.’ A Bali police spokesperson earlier confirmed officers had been forced to stop questioning Ms Dougall temporarily due to her bad health. 'We don't interrogate sick people,' he said. 'It will be against their human rights. We will be waiting until she is healthy again and then we will continue the questions.' Problems: Ms Dougall is now believed to be seeing a psychiatrist in hospital . Starved: Reports have said she did not eat anything for more than five days . Dougall has consistently protested her innocence since her arrest, insisting she was the victim of a 'fit-up'. The four suspects were held in a sting operation after British housewife Lindsay Sandiford, 55, was allegedly caught with 4.8kg of cocaine stuffed in the lining of a suitcase after being stopped at Bali's Denpasar airport after she arrived from Bangkok on May 19. Customs officials allegedly found 10.3lb of cocaine wrapped in pink gift paper. Bali’s head of Customs, Mr Made Wijaya, said: ‘It was stupid. There had been no attempt to conceal it.’ He . claimed that Sandiford had previously met up with Dougall in a . Bangkok airport cafe. She had been given a sim card for her mobile phone and that Sandiford made a ‘dry run’ a few days before she was found with the drugs. He . said: ‘She came into Bali on  May 5 and left a few days later. Then she . came in on May 19, which is when she was arrested. I believe she only . did this because she was forced to.’ Accused: Ms Dougall is pictured with her partner and fellow suspect Julian Ponder . Drugs: Lindsay Sandiford was allegedly caught with 4.8kg of cocaine stuffed in the lining of a suitcase as she arrived on the island . Referring to Dougall, he said: ‘She ordered the drugs. She organised this. Rachel was telling Lindsay what to do. Rachel made the first contact with Lindsay.’ It is believed Sandiford decided to co-operate with the police over a £1 bowl of chilli fried rice. They told her she would face the death penalty unless she helped trap the other suspected members of the drugs gang. A sting was set up allowing Sandiford to keep the drugs . with her in a £25-a-night hotel room, where she was accompanied by an . undercover police officer while she waited to be contacted by one of the . others in the alleged syndicate. Police claim Ponder turned up at the hotel while another Briton, Paul . Beales, whom they believe was the gang’s ‘muscle’, waited nearby. Informant: Sandiford reportedly gave police information about the other suspects over a £1 bowl of chilli rice . Suspect: Paul Beales, right, has also been arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking . Ponder has alleged that he was set up by Sandiford as he went to pick up a birthday present for his daughter. Dougall . and Ponder's plush Bali villa was built on 17,222 sq ft of land bought in . 2009 — the year after Mr Ponder’s UK-based party-organising business was . liquidated with huge debts. The . luxurious property is worth at least $300,000 (£195,000) on the local . market — a small fortune in Indonesia, where the minimum wage is about . £100 a month. It . is located in the village of Desa Belalang in Tabanan, about an hour’s . drive from Bali’s main tourist areas. The couple began living here with . their daughter a few months ago. The couple are also believed to own a property in Cyprus. The Foreign Office said British officials were helping Dougall's daughter as well as the arrested Britons.

A Second World War hero is selling his bravery medal to help with his grandson’s university costs. Major Bill Pickering, 88, hopes to raise as much as £30,000 from the sale of the Military Medal he was awarded after a dangerous spying mission in Italy in 1945. The family were at first against the . idea, but Major Pickering said it was better for them to have the money . from his medal now rather than it to be left gathering dust in a drawer. Devoted: Bill Pickering, pictured left during the war, and right today, hopes to support his family with the money from selling his medal . Rare: Maj Pickering's Military Medal is particularly valuable because it was won after an operation in Italy . The grandfather, from Lea Green, . Greater Manchester, was a daring Special Operations Executive agent in . World War II and was awarded the gallantry medal for his work behind . enemy lines in Italy in 1945. He said: 'I have known of several war veterans who have sold their medals to look after their family. Pass: This scrap of paper was used by Bill Pickering to ensure safe passage in lawless the mountains of northern Italy . 'I am not short of a few bob so I . don’t need it but it is better for my family to have the money now . rather than have the medals gathering dust. 'I am 88 years old and when I go I want to make sure there is plenty left for my wife in case she needs looking after. 'We have got two grandsons and one of . them is at university and I am sure he can use some of the money to . help pay his fees or rent. 'At first my wife Rossana and son David weren’t in favour of me selling my medals but they realise it is my decision. 'I . get the medals out and wear them at my local branch of the Parachute . Regiment’s parade every year but the rest of the time they are kept in a . drawer.' His son said: 'We would prefer him to keep hold of his medals because they are very precious and personal to him. 'Matthew has done one year at university and we have paid his fees for next year. 'But it is my father’s decision and it is up to him what he wants to do with them.' Maj Pickering lied about his age in order to join the army following the outbreak of World War II. Up until then he had been working as a trainee accounts clerk for a grocery business. He went on to volunteer for the Special Operations Executive and was parachuted behind enemy lines to carry out spying missions. It was a hugely brave act, because spies who were caught by the Germans were summarily executed. He said: 'Usually spies were executed very quickly, I think it was probably bravado that made me volunteer. 'At first I went on a few drops, taking agents behind the lines and training them in Morse code. Comrades in arms: Pickering (second right) in Turin with fellow soldiers at the war's end . 'I . was parachuted into north west Italy and the mission was to arm the . partisans by arranging for supplies and ammunition to get to them by . keeping in radio contact.' Maj Pickering received his Military Medal following an operation in which he and four other agents were pursued and shot at by the Nazis for two months in north west Italy in 1945. Maj Pickering, then a sergeant, and his captain, John Keany, were tracked down to a farmhouse. The young soldier told Keany of his fears that Germans were approaching them as they headed up a hilltop. He wrote in his memoirs: 'There was . not a sound or a sight to back up my claim. Keany said: ""Don't be silly, . Bill. They couldn't creep up a hill like this without us seeing or . hearing them."" 'To the best of my recollection, those were Keany's last words. Devoted: Hero Bill Pickering with his wife Rosanna, who he hopes to support with the money from selling his medal . Weapons supplies: Maj Pickering, left, with Italian fighters at a memorial service in 1988 . 'I had a sub-machine gun and started firing back. We retreated and gave each other firing cover as we did. Luckily we escaped.' Capt Keany was shot dead, along with four local partisans, while Maj Pickering stood beside him. Against all odds, Maj Pickering escaped . and managed to prevent his wireless set from falling into enemy hands. He returned to the scene the next day to recover his captain’s body and . arrange for its burial. Pickering joined up with another . group and continued to harass the enemy and among the partisans became . known as 'Inglese Billy' or 'il biondino'. He was present at the liberation of . Turin and later met an Italian woman, Rossana, who he married in . Cheadle, Greater Manchester. The Military Medal is being sold with six others and various mementoes including photographs. His Military Medal along with the . 1939-45 Star, Africa Star, Italy Star, Defence and War Medals 1939-45 . are being sold by London auctioneers Dix, Noonan and Webb. The 88-year-old, pictured with his Italian wife Rossanna, is determined to provide for her and his son's family . David Erskine-Hill explained that Maj Pickering should have received the higher award of a Distinguished Conduct Medal but did not due to a clerical error. He said: 'Maj Pickering would have been in no doubt whatsoever of his fate if captured - immediate execution at best - and yet when two of his officers were killed on operations, one of them riddled with machine-gun fire within six feet of him, he took charge of the mission and remained active in the field until the war’s end. 'He was rightly recommended for an immediate award of the Distinguished Conduct Medal, though an ill-informed senior had this reduced to the Military Medal. 'Be that as it may, his Military Medal is a great rarity, more so than similar decorations issued to the wartime SAS.' Maj Pickering’s gong is said to be particularly desirable because he operated in Italy and not in France like most other SoE agents. The auction takes place on Wednesday, and will be conducted by Dix Noonan Webb in London.","Special Ops agent Bill Pickering regularly parachuted behind enemy lines .

Shadow business secretary: Chuka Umunna will today argue that gang members demonstrate high levels of business acumen that could be put to good use . Young gang members display 'entrepreneurial zeal' in their criminal activities and should be encouraged to start their own businesses, according to the shadow business secretary. Chuka Umunna will today argue that teenagers involved in street crime demonstrate high levels of business acumen that could be put to good use if channelled in the the right way. The reality of entrepreneurial, young . inner-city gang members is similar to those portrayed in hit U.S. TV . series The Wire, which was based around a police operation to tap the . phones of highly-organised drug dealers in Baltimore. In a speech in Westminster, Mr Umunna, the Labour MP for Streatham, will say the way gangs build their own 'brand' through the internet shows a sense of enterprise that despite being 'shocking', needs to be redirected and positively harnessed. He will focus on his own borough of Lambeth as the perfect example of how the skills and energies of young people are being wasted as they become sucked into criminal life. Mr Umunna, who is Chair of the London Gangs Forum, will say: 'Make no mistake - at the heart of these gangs activities are criminality and very serious violence. 'But if one studies what Lambeth’s gangs do in more detail, it is both shocking and frustrating - they put a lot of effort into building up their gang’s brand. 'You can find music videos they produce to promote their activities on YouTube. This brand building is shocking because it glamorises what they do. Actor Dominic West as Jimmy McNulty in HBO hit The Wire, which was based around a police operation to tap the phones of highly organised drug dealers in Baltimore . 'What frustrates me is many of these young people are using skills that if channelled in the right way, would provide them with an alternative route to success.' He will add: 'In Lambeth, too much of this entrepreneurial instinct is being channelled into totally the wrong thing. 'Their entrepreneurial zeal, used in a legitimate business setting, could provide them with a ladder up. 'We must make legitimate business a more feasible avenue through which our young people can realise their dreams even when all else may have failed them.'

Manchester United have applied to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange in the hope of raising 100million dollars (£64m) from selling shares in the club. The Barclays Premier League club filed documents with the United States government's Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday. Share prices have yet to be set, but United would use the money raised from the flotation to reduce its debts, the application said. Owner: Malcolm Glazer, left, took over Manchester United in May 2005. Right, his son Joel Glazer watches a game at Old Trafford . The flotation would leave control over the club in the hands of the Glazer family, the billionaire US sports investors who bought the club in 2005 for 1.47bn dollars (£940m) - a takeover which left debts of £423million. The club pursued a 1bn-dollar (£640m) flotation on the Singapore stock market last year but the move was halted because of the volatile global economy. Under the reorganisation, the team would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Manchester United Ltd, a newly-formed holding company based in the Cayman Islands. Investment: Fans gather outside Old Trafford. The club is expected to raise £64m by floating on the New York Stock Exchange . Duncan Drasdo, chief executive of the Manchester United Supporters' Trust (MUST), welcomed the plan to reduce the club's debt. But he questioned the value of the shares on offer compared with those owned by the Glazers. Drasdo said: 'A minority shareholding with inferior voting rights and no dividends is going to severely impact on the attraction to both financial and supporter investors. 'However, if it turns out that the vast majority of the proceeds are used to pay off the debt that is certainly something MUST would welcome and entirely vindicates our long-standing position that their debt was damaging our club.' In April, Manchester United was valued by Forbes magazine at 2.24bn dollars (£1.43bn), making it the most valuable club in world football for the eighth year in a row. The Glazer's takeover in May 2005 of the now 132-year-old club sparked controversy among fans. Supporters were angry that the club had been saddled with £660m in debt after complex refinancing. They feared that ticket and merchandise prices could have to increase to pay off the interest on various loans. Angry fans wearing gold and green scarves and waving a 'Love United hate Glazer' banner clash with police outside Old Trafford during a demonstration against the owners . Groups of disgruntled fans formed campaigns to voice their anger - with large numbers wearing gold and green scarves. The 'Love United Hate Glazer' movement also staged protests at games and slapped graffiti stickers around the club. A new club called F.C. United of Manchester was also formed as an alternative to Manchester United. Despite a group called the 'Red Knights' making some attempts at taking over the club, the Glazers have remained in charge.

The mahogany box, described as a 'medicinal time capsule', comes complete with 29 exotically named bottled concoctions that would have been used by doctors to treat ailments such as gout, depression and indigestion.

The chest, dated 1817, comes complete with an instruction book . However, the likes of Laudanum - described in an accompanying handbook as 'as one of the most valuable medicines afflicted with mankind' - are now strictly controlled. This is not that surprising as Laudanum, an alcoholic herb preparation, contains opium. Other remedies popular in 1817, when the chest was made up, such as Turkey rhubarb (a plant thought to have healing properties), and cream of tartar (a byproduct of winemaking that was used as a laxative), have long since been replaced by more modern medicines. The set, found at a house in Derbyshire, also contains scales and mixing bowls .

Other remedies popular in 1817, such as Turkey rhubarb, a plant thought to have healing properties, and cream of tartar, a byproduct of winemaking that was used as a laxative, have long since been replaced by modern medicines . Here are just some of the 'miracle potions' found in the medicine chest... Manna: . A sweet substance obtained from various plants, especially from an ash . tree, Fraxinus ornus  ('manna' or 'flowering ash') was used as a mild . laxative. Steers’s Opodeldoc: This liniment was made from soap, spirit of wine, camphor, rosemary oil and sometimes spirit of ammonia. Tincture of fine Turkey rhubarb: A plant thought to have healing properties. Peppermint water: Used to treat ailments such as diarrhoea, flatulence and vomiting. Laudanum: Alcoholic herb preparation containing opium, which 'seldom fails to occasion a calmness in the system whence its use in gout and spasmodic disorders'. Lavender: Herb (right) used for digestive ailments - and 'useful for cases of depression, sickness and languor'. Epsom salts: Used as a mild laxative and anti-inflammatory agent. Cream of tartar: Byproduct of winemaking used as a laxative. Best double-distilled cardamon: An aromatic spice used for digestive relief. The chest was discovered in a house in Derbyshire. Auctioneer Charles Hanson, who will oversee its sale in Derby on Saturday, said it may have been used out of hours by a doctor on call, or owned by the family of a large country house to carry with them on a long journey by horse and carriage. Mr Hanson, who has appeared on BBC1’s Bargain Hunt, added: 'It would appear the chest, which dates back to the early 19th century, has been untouched for almost 200 years. 'It is wonderfully complete. It even has its original companion instruction book on how to apply the medicinal potions in the glass bottles, and what they may cure. 'I suspect the box was only used once or twice to administer medicines and has then been hidden away in an old country attic or cellar for almost two centuries.' As well as the bottled medicines, the chest also contains a complete set of utensils including scales, mixing bowls and a scalpel. Mr Hanson said: 'The bottles are a variety of colour, with liquid and solid contents from the Georgian period still visible. 'It is a medicine chest far removed from today’s practising doctors.' The handbook claims that 'diseases which threaten the most fatal consequences may be averted or subdued by the exercise of good sense and prudence and by timely recourse to the medicine chest'. It adds that the medicines 'are of the best quality and are selected for their efficacy. The doses are in general smaller than professional men might deem necessary'. The booklets also contains a description of each remedy, and what it should be used for. The chest was made up a year before the first successful blood transfusion, and 30 years before the first painless surgery with general anaesthetic . It states that 'Turkey rhubarb is an admirable medicine for disorder of the bowel. The dose is ten to thirty grains mixed with peppermint water.' A bottle of Laudanum in the chest 'seldom fails to occasion a calmness and quietude in the system whence its use in gout and spasmodic disorders', according to the guide. It wasn't until 1870 that Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch realised germs - not 'bad air' - caused diseases, leading to innovations such as antibiotics.

'I hope it is purchased by a doctor or medical professional who can appreciate how far we have come in the last 195 years!'

Mr Raper has been an enthusiastic kayaker since discovering the sport on a course when he was 13 and is a committee member of Scarborough and District Canoe Club. Club spokesman Martin Stirling said the teenager had travelled to Norway after visiting the Alps. He added: 'They had a lot of hot weather and the rivers were extremely high. Mr Raper went down a stretch of the river and disappeared. 'They finished the main body of the search on Monday morning.' Rapids: Mr Raper was kayaking down the River Raundalen when he went missing (file picture) Mr Stirling said that the search had involved helicopters and dog teams.

Accused: Steve Powell, stands before the judge enters the court for the second day of his trial for voyeurism charges . 'Sexually graphic and obsessive' diary entries belonging to the father-in-law of missing Utah mother Susan Powell were read out in court yesterday in which he described himself as a 'voyeur' and 'sexually out of control '. The judge presiding over the trial of Steven Powell will decide today whether or not the excerpts can be used as evidence in the 14 counts of voyeurism against him. Yesterday, the judge dismissed a charge of possession of child pornography against Powell, ruling the 2,000 images - of his neighbor's children taking a bath - did not prove he influenced the conduct of the subject of the pictures, for example asking them to pose provocatively. Prosecutors told Pierce County Superior Court Judge Ronald Culpepper yesterday they want to use eight portions of Powell's diaries they seized from his home last year which range in date between 2003 and 2010. Samples were read aloud and included phrases like: 'Susan likes to be admired and I'm a voyeur', 'I'm a voyeur and Susan is an exhibitionist' and 'I've been going nuts and nearly out of control sexually my entire life,' according to the Deseret News. Prosecutors also noted that in 2004, . Powell wrote in his diary that he 'likes taking video shots of pretty . girls in shorts and skirts, beautiful women of every age'. Deputy Pierce County attorney Bryce Nelson said the vast majority of the writing was 'obsessing' over Susan Powell, his daughter-in-law who has been missing in 2009 and talking of how he stalked her and secretly watched or videotaped her. Center of the debate: Steve Powell kept pictures of Susan breastfeeding and changing and diary entries detailing he watched her often . The judge said yesterday he was reluctant to use the diaries because of how much material mentioned the missing Utah woman and seemed to 'prove Steven Powell had an obsession with Susan Powell rather than proving any pattern of voyeurism'. But prosecutors argue that the diaries will help the jury understand how deep he was into voyeurism and pornography. Excerpts from Powell's diary read aloud in court . Defense attorney Travis Currie said the excerpts should not be used because it takes away from the voyeurism aspects of the trial and puts the focus on Susan Powell and her husband Josh, who killed himself and the couple's two sons in a . fiery explosion in February at a house in Graham. Many believed the murder suicide was an admission of guilt in his wife's disappearance but Chuck and Judy Cox have always maintained that Steven Powell had something to do with their daughter's disappearance. Josh Powell was the only named person of interest in the case but was never charged or arrested. He claimed he took his young sons, then four and two, camping on the freezing winter night around 12.30am. When he came home, Susan was gone and he said she  had run off with another man. Authorities searched the desert for twelve days in the area where Josh Powell said he went camping that night. At one point, they said they found a 'shallow grave' after cadaver dogs alerted them to the spot. But they found no human remains. Concerned: Susan's parents, Judy and Chuck Cox, hope that Steve Powell 'slips' and reveals something about the 2009 disappearance of their daughter . Defense attorney: Travis Currie, left, talks to Steve Powell, the day after a judge dismissed a child pornography charge against Powell, the father-in-law of missing Utah mother Susan Powell . Defense attorneys argued that even the mention of Susan Powell's name would prejudice a jury as it has been such a high-profile case, culminating in the murder of her sons earlier this year. It also emerged that a recording of . Powell sexually gratifying himself while looking at pictures of Susan . was discovered along with thousands of pictures that focused on her . behind and taken while she was breastfeeding. Pierce . County prosecutors agreed about the risk of prejudice, but said the . passages were crucial to prove that Steve Powell recorded the images, . and that he did it for his sexual gratification. Other categories of digital files . included close-ups of women putting groceries in their cars and others . titled, 'DMV girl', 'Tacoma Mall', 'gum-chewing cutie', and 'young teen . volleyball player'. Opening statements in the trial are likely to begin on Wednesday, assuming a jury is selected by then. Center of the debate: Steve Powell (left) previously claimed that he and Susan (right) were a perfect match because he was a voyeur and she enjoyed being watched . Susan Powell's parents Chuck and Judy . Cox watched anxiously as Powell was led into the courtroom yesterday . wearing handcuffs, a tie and gray suit. While more than 60 potential jurors . filled out questionnaires in another room, prosecutors and defense . attorneys discussed how much should be disclosed at the trial about . Steve Powell's apparent obsession with his son's wife. If convicted of the remaining 14 . charges, he would face a guideline sentence of about four years but the . state has alleged aggravating circumstances that could result in a . longer term. The thousands of images found by . investigators reportedly show a decade’s worth of his work, but in this . specific case they are expected to focus on the ones relating to the . years 2006 and 2007. They volunteered to redact her name, and the judge and defense counsel agreed with the suggestion. Revelations: Charlie and Braden were beginning to speak more and more about their mother, saying she was 'in the trunk' and then that she disappeared . Tragedy: Powell blew up his Washington home, pictured, killing himself and the two young boys when they were dropped off for a supervised visit .

Steve Powell's arrest prompted the state to take custody of Josh Powell's sons, who were living with their father at Steve Powell's home. The boys were turned over to Susan Powell's parents, prompting a custody fight that ended Feb. 5, when Josh Powell locked a social worker out of his home during what was supposed to be a supervised visit with his sons. He attacked Charlie and Braden, 7 and 5, with a hatchet, then started a fire that killed all three as the social worker called 911.","Steven Powell kept pictures of Susan Powell breastfeeding and changing .

Police say ‘Time is running out’ in the search for the former beauty queen wife of the great grandson of scout movement founder Lord Baden-Powell who mysteriously went missing six days ago. Today evidence bags were seized from the property where Gerard Baden-Clay is staying in Brisbane, Australia, as police continued their efforts to find his 43-year-old wife Allison. Officers arrived at the home of Mr Baden-Clay's parents in the Kenmore area of the city and collected a number of unidentified items, although according to the Brisbane's Courier Mail a computer was among property seized. Mystery: Allison Baden-Clay has been missing for six days. She is the wife of Gerard Baden-Clay, the great grandson of Scout movement founder Lord Robert Baden-Powell . Mr Baden-Clay is a descendant of Lord Baden-Powell, a former lieutenant-general in the British Army, who founded the Scout movement in the early 20th century. He has told police that he last saw his wife when they went to sleep together on Thursday of last week. He said when he woke up the following morning she was gone and that on Sunday, as he was driving to a police station to give details of the last time he saw his wife, he crashed his car into a bus stop and was taken to hospital with minor injuries before being released. Despite the removal of evidence from his parents' property police say Mr Baden-Clay, a prominent Brisbane real estate agent  is ‘not considered a person of interest in his wife's disappearance’. Evidence: Queensland Police detectives leave a house belonging to the parents of Gerard Baden-Clay in Kenmore, north-west Brisbane . Family ties: Elaine Baden Clay (left) outside her home from which . evidence was removed today. Police insist Mr Baden-Clay is 'not . considered a person of interest in his wife's disappearance' Today officers were also checking scrubland, drains and tunnels in the leafy suburbs surrounding the couple's home and police say they have spent four hours interviewing a woman believed to be a former colleague of Mr Baden-Clay. So far more than 100 officers and volunteers have been involved in the search for mother of three but as yet no clues to her whereabouts have been uncovered. Her fading mobile phone signal has been used to triangulate her last known location to an area spanning three suburbs and residents living in the area have been asked to check their properties for any sign of the woman or her mobile phone. What happened? Mr Baden-Clay has told police that he last saw his wife when they went to sleep together on Thursday last week. When he woke up in the morning she was gone . Superintendent Shane Dall'osto said: 'Time is running out. We're looking for Allison. We believe she is still out there.' Residents have also asked to keep an eye out for grey tracksuit pants, white running shoes and a white or black top - the clothing Mrs Baden-Clay was believed to be wearing when she disappeared. 'It is very diverse countryside - some of it is very unkempt and we are really appealing to the public, people that may not have searched their property, if they could do that,' added Detective Superintendent Mark Ainsworth. He said he was particularly interested in hearing from anyone who saw either of the cars owned by the Baden-Clays - a white Toyota Prado and a silver Holden Captiva - being driven at the time she disappeared, between 8pm on Thursday and 6am on Friday. Proud past: Sir Robert Baden-Powell (pictured) is the great grandfather of Gerard Baden-Clay. Mr Baden-Clay says he is praying that his missing wife will be found safe and well . The Forensic Crash Unit, he said, was investigating the incident in which Mr Baden-Clay's car crashed into the bus stop leaving him with bruised ribs. Supt Ainsworth said Mr Baden-Clay was staying with his parents and had provided 'a version of events to police in relation to specific matters' relating to a scratch he had on his face. Mrs Baden-Clay, who speaks five languages and is a former ballerina, is described as a creature of habit, waking every morning for her daily walk in the wealthy district where she lived. Mr Baden-Clay's sister said earlier this week that he is under enormous pressure and is praying for his wife's safe return. A profile about Mr Baden-Clay on a Brisbane real estate web page states: 'His personal philosophies of ethical excellence and team loyalty, derived from his lineage as the great-grandson of international Scouts founder Baden Powell, have clearly found their perfect landing spot in the field of real estate.'","'We're looking for Allison.

The M4 motorway has reopened in both directions a week after it was closed for emergency repair works but questions have been raised if the job was rushed to prevent national humiliation. The road, which is expected to be one of the busiest routes during the Olympic Games, was shut last Friday between junctions 2 and 3 after cracks were discovered on a viaduct. It was reopened to traffic - but only to cars and lorries under 7.5 tonnes - at around 5.30am after engineers completed the 'complex' repairs which were due to be fixed yesterday. It prompted Labour to question if safety corners were cut and the job rushed to prevent embarrassment ahead of the arrival of Olympic athletes and their families on Monday. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Good news: The M4 motorway has reopened in both directions a week after it was closed for emergency repair works, the Highways Agency said this morning . Labour shadow transport spokesman John Woodcock described the reopening of the M4 as a 'huge relief', but said ministers needed to come out and confirm they were totally happy that the road was safe to use. He said: ’Given the scale of the problem, ministers need to come out and say they are completely confident the crack is fixed.’He told BBC Breakfast: 'The whole country wants the Olympics to be a huge success so it is a huge relief that the road is open because of the chaos it would have caused with athletes arriving on Monday to travel to the Olympic Village.’ The shadow transport minister added: 'There are real questions as to why this crack was found so late in the day as works have been going on there for some time.'The Highways Agency hinted that an exception to the weight rule may be made for Olympic coaches transporting Olympic VIPs and athletes to and from Heathrow  preparations for the games get underway.A spokesman added: ""The crack was discovered during an ongoing repair programme. Work on that continues and for this reason vehicles weighing 7.5 tonnes or more will still be restricted from using the motorway between the junctions. A diversion route remains in place via the A4 and A312 dual carriageways.' But Roads Minister Mike Penning blasted Labour and other critics for ‘scaremongering’ over suggestions that engineers might have been bounced off by the Government into re-opening the M4 when it wasn’t totally safe to do so, saying those who spread such tales should be ‘ashamed’ of themselves.Speaking at the worksite on the M4, Mr Penning assured motorists the bridge was safe stressing: ‘Don't be scared. Scaremongers will be scaring you. Structural engineers have specifically done all the work. No structural engineer in this country is going to say ""Minister, you can open that bridge"" unless they are certain it is perfectly safe. 'Anyone saying it isn't safe is scaremongering and they should be ashamed of themselves.’He also denied political pressure had prompted the swift reopening of the motorway: ‘There was absolutely none at all, structural engineers don't work that way. You can say what you like to them but it's their reputation and their careers, their job is about safety. ‘Yes we have a commitment to have this open not only for the Olympics but for the people of London and this country because it's a major route in and out and of course I wanted it open but I said it would open when it was safe and this morning it was safe for seven and a half tonnes.’ Elsewhere: The first Games visitors arriving at Heathrow¿s Terminal Five faced two-hour immigration queues as Border Force desks remained unmanned . He added: ‘I've just passed a message . from the Prime Minister to the hard working engineers to thank them for . what they have done 24/7 to get this motorway open.’ The hairline crack was found on a highly stressed section of bridge . supports by engineers who had been carrying out other repairs on the . busy section of road. 'The Highways Agency closed the motorway . last Friday night because in entering the final stages of the repair . work, a new crack was found in a highly stressed part of the bridge . supports,' the spokesman continued. 'This required a unique repair solution involving the manufacturing bespoke specialist steel plates and their installation over the crack. 'The crack then had to be removed to prevent further damage to the structure. This intricate part of the operation took several hours - even though the crack was a hairline one.' Summit: Transport Minister Justine Greening has held emergency talks today to try to solve the problems . The M4, which is the main route from London to Heathrow Airport and the West of England, was initially closed between junctions 1 and 3, causing misery for thousands of motorists. It is expected to be one of the busiest routes during the Games because it links London and the Olympic Park in Stratford with Heathrow. The motorway will officially become part of the Olympic Route Network on Monday, with one lane of each carriageway reserved for competitors, officials and sponsors. Drivers have been warned the ORN will include temporary changes including suspended turns, stopping and loading restrictions and traffic signal alterations. A perfect storm of Olympic transport chaos erupted as Downing Street sought to cope with the closure of the M4 and long queues at Heathrow. The first Games visitors . arriving at Heathrow’s Terminal Five faced two-hour immigration queues . as Border Force desks remained unmanned. Before it reopened today, No 10 was drawing up . contingency plans to deal with the M4 fiasco. Downing Street had refused to rule out . options such as opening up a single M4 lane for Olympic traffic – . denying access to the motorway to all other motorists or hauliers – or . even commandeering the Heathrow Express train for the sole use of . Olympic VIPs to avoid putting stress on the stricken M4 bridge. Another . option looked at was to reopen the motorway to cars only – but turn . back all lorries and buses except for the Olympic coaches. Empty: This stretch of the M4 near London was completely closed for emergency maintenance . Cracks: White paint marks the cracks in the elevated section of the Boston Manor Viaduct flyover which need fixing before the Olympics starts. The cracks were first spotted four months ago . The Prime Minister was updated . several times yesterday and sent Transport Secretary Justine Greening to . the scene amid concerns that the repair work is not proceeding quickly . enough. Determined: Roads minister Mike Penning had vowed the motorway would reopen on schedule . Crisis talks were also held with London Transport Commissioner Peter Hendy and London 2012 transport director Richard George. Labour said David Cameron  was . presiding over a ‘national embarrassment’ which meant ‘humiliation’ for . Britain as London prepared to welcome the world to the Games. But Miss Greening’s supporters said Labour was ‘deeply irresponsible’ and playing politics with people’s lives over road safety. Adding to the Government’s woes, . there was fury at Heathrow where passengers faced long queues as . immigration desks remained empty. The Home Office has promised to beef up staff numbers for the Olympics though they will not go ‘live’ until Sunday. Airport operator BAA confirmed immigration queues of ‘around an hour-and-a-half’ – double the 45 minute target. The Immigration Services Union said . the combination of the first Olympic visitors with the start of the . school holidays ‘meant things were expected to get bad’ and said not . enough had been done to address the issue. Lucy Noreton, deputy general . secretary of the ISU, said drafting in contingency staff on Sunday was . ‘too little, too late’, adding: ‘Is this a national embarrassment – yes . probably.’ The Prime Minister’s official . spokesman said: ‘We are looking at various contingency plans to ensure . athletes and the Games family arriving at Heathrow can get through . easily.’ Repairs are ongoing on the M4 elevated section in west London after cracks were found in the bridge section . Repair job: Road workers are working around the clock to fix the cracked section of the motorway in West London . Stuck: The Great West Road (A4) is a key diversion route but has been impassible at times .

Masked gunmen have today killed nine trainee policemen after storming a house in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore. It is the second attack on security forces in the relatively peaceful Punjab province in four days. Police said at least half a dozen gunmen . were involved in the attack on the housing compound. Terror: Masked gunmen have today killed nine trainee policemen after storming a house in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore. This is a file picture of the city . Lahore city police chief Aslam Tareen . said: 'At around 6 a.m., masked gunmen on three motorcycles stormed the . house and opened fire. 'The victims were trainees at the Punjab Jail Academy.' No group has claimed responsibility for today's attack, which also left three policemen wounded. But police suspect it was carried out by Islamist militants. Many of the police officers were from the insurgency-hit northwestern Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province near the border with Afghanistan. On Monday, gunmen killed seven soldiers and a policeman at a riverside military encampment in eastern Pakistan, 60 miles north of Lahore. Unrest: Protesters shout slogans during a rally condemning the movement of Nato supplies to Afghanistan through Pakistan earlier this week . The unrest happened in Gujrat where thousands of hardline Islamists . spent the night on their way to the capital to protest over the . government's recent decision to reopen the Nato supply line to . Afghanistan. Police chief Basharat Mahmood said it was unclear if any of the Islamist . protesters were involved in the incident but that it was 'surely a . terrorist attack.' The camp was attacked at around 5.20am local time, a little less than an . hour after the leaders of the Difah-e-Pakistan, or Defence of Pakistan, . protest movement finished delivering speeches inside the city. The group, which includes hardline Islamist politicians and religious . leaders, left the city of Lahore along with 8,000 supporters . in 200 vehicles to make the 185-mile (300km) journey to Islamabad. They travelled about halfway, spent the night in Gujrat and planned to . hold a protest in front of parliament in the capital.

The leaders of Difah-e-Pakistan include people with known militant . links, including Hafiz Saeed, the founder of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba . militant group, and Maulana Samiul Haq, known as the father of the .

Dog-loving Minister Greg Barker has acknowledged that putting his pet dachshund’s pillow-like ‘warming pad’ in the microwave at his Whitehall office was never going to be the smartest move. Mr Barker’s colleagues at the Department of Energy use the same microwave to heat their tea and coffee – and one of them made an official complaint about his ‘unhygienic’ behaviour. Although he has apologised, the Energy and Climate Change Minister is adamant he has no plans to stop taking his pet to work from time to time. Popular: Dog loving Energy Minister Greg Barker at home with his 19-week-old Dachsund Otto who joins him at work from time to time . Conservative Mr Barker, a close friend of David Cameron, started taking 20-week-old Otto to his office because he thought he was too young to leave at home. ‘I bought the heat pad to go under his mat,’ he said. ‘It helps Otto nod off to sleep. 'Unfortunately, I forgot to heat it up at home so I popped it in the microwave when I got to the office, which I shouldn’t have done. 'There was a complaint and I have said sorry.’ Mr Barker says his dog is enormously helpful in getting meetings with foreign dignitaries off to a smooth start. Pampered pooch: Otto, the beloved dachshund belonging to Tory Energy and Climate Change Minister Greg Barker . ‘Otto is a tremendous ice-breaker,’ he said. ‘People melt when they see him. Some officials come to my office just to see Otto and take him for walks. 'The face of the lovely lady on our reception desk lights up when I arrive with Otto.’ One of Otto’s fans is Colombian environment minister Frank Pearl, who visited Britain recently. Mr Barker recalled: ‘At the end  of our meeting, Mr Pearl said, “Mr Barker, can I ask a special favour? I would love to have my picture taken with your dog.” Otto was fast asleep but we took a photo and Frank sent it to his daughter in South America. Eccentric: Mr Barker said he would continue to take the dog into work with him from time to time . ‘Otto is great for morale and people love to have a cuddle with him. He lightens the atmosphere in a stressful world, though I accept that you can only take a dog to work when it is appropriate. 'But he is very small and easy to look after.’ Otto does seem to be on his best behaviour when he’s at the office, sitting next to Mr Barker’s desk for most of the day. The Minister says the animal is house-trained, though he takes a pooper-scooper to work just in case. ‘We have only had a minor accident so far,’ he added. Mr Barker has always been a dog-lover. His family had two labradors and an Irish setter when he was growing up. His two children helped him choose Otto, whom he bought for £600 from a family in his East Sussex constituency. ‘Otto was the runt of the litter, but very lovable. Being a sucker for the underdog I was drawn to him,’ he joked. ‘He is happiest at my home in Sussex, but like me, he has a sense of adventure and enjoys a trip to the capital once in a while.’ Mr Barker decided to buy a dachshund after a conversation with Italian-born socialite Carla Powell, wife of Margaret Thatcher’s former adviser Charles Powell. ‘I got talking to her on an official trip to Rome. She is crazy about dachshunds.’ Mr Barker has tried to teach Otto to ‘sit’ and ‘fetch’ – without much success. ‘He will never be as clever as Pudsey on Britain’s Got Talent,’ he admitted.","Energy Minister Greg Barker is adamant he has no plans to stop taking his pet to work .

Horror: Jordan needed a three-hour operation after he was shot in the face with an air rifle while playing with friends . Jordan had been walking with two friends on land near to Hall Lee Bank Park in Westhoughton when the sniper struck. He was taken to the Royal Bolton Hospital before being transferred to the unit in Blackburn. The teenager was finally discharged with 12 stitches both inside and outside his cheek. The swelling must clear before he can be assessed by surgeons again in two weeks. Jordan, a pupil at Hindley High, said: ‘I was just walking when I felt a sharp pain. I just remember falling to the ground. My friends told me that I was bleeding and I covered it with my sleeve. The ambulance was there the next minute. It was very scary.’ Jordan’s dad Steve Winstanley, 32, said: ‘The child or adult who has got this air rifle needs to know the danger of what they are doing. Someone out there thinks it’s okay to go around taking pot-shots at people. ‘It’s horrendous. This air rifle needs to be taken off the streets.’ Bolton CID confirmed they had launched an investigation. None of the boys saw the gunman. Witnesses can call 0161 856 0064 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.","Jordan Winstanley told by medics the shot could have severed key nerves in his left cheek and mouth .

The Resperate machine which controls blood pressure by slowing down breathing by playing relaxing music through headphones . A gadget that controls high blood pressure will be available on the NHS for the first time. The device – which looks like a portable CD player – slows down breathing by playing relaxing music through headphones. Researchers claim it could help tens of thousands of patients control high blood pressure without having to take endless drugs with unpleasant side effects. Called the Resperate, it works by . first checking a patient’s breathing via a strap tied around the chest. It then creates a tune and patients breathe in and out in time with . certain notes. The music then gradually slows down – as does the patients’ breathing. From today, it will be available for GPs to prescribe to patients at a cost of £7.40 a time. Experts are cautious and say it should not replace any high blood pressure drugs. Maker Intercure, however, claims it has helped patients come off their medication. Patients are advised to use the Resperate for at least 40 minutes a week – four sessions of  ten minutes. Risk: Around 16million Britons have high blood pressure, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes (posed by models) The average person takes 18 breaths a minute, but to lower pressure you have to take ten or fewer – which is helped by the Resperate. But experts point out there is no evidence to suggest it could replace medication. A Blood Pressure Association spokesman said: ‘As with any adjunct therapy, it must not be used as a replacement for any treatments prescribed by a GP.’ Around 16million Britons have high blood pressure. It can lead to heart attacks and strokes. Many patients are able to control it through diet and exercise but others are forced to take a cocktail of drugs including ACE inhibitors, beta blockers and alpha blockers. Some can have unpleasant side effects including swollen ankles, dizziness and tiredness.",Resperate device available on NHS for first time .

A police force cutting 620 jobs and shutting some of its stations 'frittered away' almost £500,000 on consultants paid to consider its 'culture' and 'customer journey'. West Midlands Police's decision to splash out so much money despite chopping £126 million off its budget has been branded 'astonishing' by one Birmingham MP. Labour's Steve McCabe, who represents Selly Oak and sits on the Commons’ Home Affairs Select Committee, said: 'The force is facing the biggest cuts in its history and this year is the worst year of all. Anger: Selly Oak MP Steve McCabe, left, says the spending by West Midlands Police's Chief Constable Chris Sims, right, is 'wrong' 'This is entirely the wrong time to be frittering away cash on consultants. How is all this money available for consultants when we are losing police officers hand over fist? 'I am astonished they need to bring in outside people to tell them about their own culture. 'It would be helpful if the force could provide a succinct briefing of what it is paying consultants to do. 'The Select Committee took evidence on the issue of consultants at the force and the Chief Constable was not able to explain what they do.' Details of the spending - a total of £485,000 - emerged in a report to the West Midlands Police Authority. The document, called 'external expertise to support key programmes, projects and initiatives' sets out plans to spend the cash after the force conceded it could not do the work in-house. Cuts: Prime Minister David Cameron with West Mids Chief Constable Chris Sims, right, following last year's riots in Birmingham. The force is cutting millions from its budget . The projected costs include a £75,000 budget for a review of customer service and £80,000 for finding out more about the 'customer journey'. A sum of £70,000 was set aside to conduct a study on the culture of the force. The culture audit will include workshops with staff. The report said the consultants would 'discover details of the current culture at the force and analyse the valuable and distinctive features of the current culture for retention and development.' In March, the force announced more than 300 jobs would be axed, including 85 police officer posts. A first wave of cuts was made last year and led to the loss of 173 police officer posts and 217 civilian jobs as the organisation faces £126 million-worth of budget cuts. Ian Edwards, chairman of the West Midlands Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, said: 'I would question spending this amount of money on consultants when we are losing so many police officers. 'I have no idea what the studies are, but I will certainly be interested to find out.' Another Birmingham Labour MP Khalid Mahmood, said: 'It’s a lot of money that could be used to keep police officers in their posts. 'I am bemused that we have to bring people in. Surely there are senior officers within the force that can write reports about the culture inside the force?' West Midlands Police today defended the use of external consultants and claimed they actually helped save money and improve the 'services' the force can provide. Deputy Chief Constable Dave Thompson said: 'The details of proposed consultancy was contained in a report to West Midlands Police Authority that the force produced as part of its approach to openness and transparency. 'We accept employing consultancy can be very controversial in a very difficult financial climate and ensure we make sure this information is available to the public. 'The current requirement for savings is requiring the force to work very differently. In some areas we have the skills to make these changes ourselves and in other areas we need support. 'Using specialist consultancy can be effective, provided we use their support to improve our skills to carry out this work ourselves in the future. 'We have carried out major reviews using consultants that have directly helped achieve savings and have improved the services we provide. 'Consultancy is always about supporting the ideas of our own people. 'The proposed consultancy is not about an exotic experiment in culture. It is about understanding the experience of the public and improving how we deal with people by improving how we are working. 'Very clear expectations are always set before money is spent on consultancy and these sums will be no different.'","Meanwhile West Midlands Police is cutting £126 million from its budget .

Campaigners have called on the Duchess of Cambridge to put pressure on her favourite High Street store to better the lives of its workers. Zara has hit by a string of ‘slave labour’ scandals including the deaths last month of two workers in a Bangladeshi factory which supplies the Spanish chain. Kate, who turns 30 on Monday, is seen regularly shopping in the chain’s branches and has worn two of its outfits on high profile public occasions since becoming a member of the royal family. The first was a £49.99 cornflower blue dress she sported the day after her April wedding as she and Prince William left by helicopter from Buckingham Palace. The second was a daringly short nude and black lace tulip dress she wore to a Gary Barlow charity concert at the Royal Albert Hall shortly before Christmas. Both sold out within hours. The publicity was a huge coup for the firm which has been heavily criticised for the standards in factories used to manufacture its clothes. This week hundreds of workers took to the streets in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, demanding compensation for the families of victims of a blaze at the Eurotex factory in December. Taslima Akter, 22, and Jesmin Akter, 20, were died after a boiler explosion caused staff to stampede. The country’s National Garment Workers’ Association, partnered by British charity War On Want, are supporting the calls for redress. Greg Muttitt, campaigns and policy director at War on Want, said: ‘Kate has been a public ambassador for the Zara brand. In contrast, she has shown no interest in the lives and conditions of the workers who make Zara’s clothes. Problems: Zara has been hit by a string of 'slave labour' scandals including the deaths last month of two workers in a Bangladeshi factory which supplies the Spanish chain . ‘Following this tragedy, a people’s princess would insist that Zara fairly compensates the bereaved families and call on the British government to enact legislation to protect overseas workers for UK retailers.’ Zara is owned by Inditex, a family business founded in 1975 by Amancio Ortega.

As a lone RAF wartime aircraft circled a blue sky in the Peak District this morning, the landscape looked a picturesque scene of tranquility and calm. But sixty-nine years ago today, the view from the ground looked very different as the brave Dam Busters crew took to the air, practicing for a stealth mission to destroy Germany's dams during World War Two. Today a flying company offered war enthusiasts the chance to follow the identical flight path over the Howden, Derwent and Ladybower dams in a original Tiger Moth biplane - the aircraft the elite Lancaster squadron would have learnt to fly in. Step back in time: A Second World War Tiger Moth flies low over Derwent Reservoir, retracing the steps of Dam Buster Lancaster pilots who trained there . Taking to the skies: Dam Buster Lancaster pilots trained in the Peak District 69 years ago today ahead of their bouncing-bomb attack on Germany on 17 May 1943 . Scenic view: The nostalgic flight is just one of many being flown by this original Tiger Moth biplane. It gives people the chance to experience the practice route over the Derbyshire reservoirs in an original World War Two aircraft . Mission: Eight aircraft, such as the Lancaster pictured, failed to return, 53 men were killed and three became prisoners of war . The aircrew from 617 Squadron headed to the Derwent Valley to train in extreme low-level flying in bombers in preparation to destroy dams in Germany’s Ruhr Valley using top-secret ‘bouncing bombs’. The Derwent Dam and it’s surrounding hills resembled that of some of the German dams so formed a perfect training ground for the elite Lancaster squadron. Pilot, Will Flanagan, 32, said: 'All the Lancaster pilots would have learnt to fly in a Tiger Moth just like this one. 'I . fly as low as I can on the ‘Dam Buster Run Missions’ but I can’t imagine . how they managed to fly those bombers at only sixty feet above the . water – especially with people shooting at them. 'I . get a buzz from flying it, the provenance, smell and feel of an open . cockpit – there’s nothing like feeling the wind blowing through your . hair – it’s what I’d call real flying. 'I recently flew an RAF veteran who’d . worked as a ground based engineer on Lancasters during the war – he had . never flown in a Lancaster but wanted to know what it felt like to fly . over the dams. He found it very emotional – it’s a very nostalgic trip . for some of the older guys. 'This . is the only World War Two aircraft that you can fly the Dam Busters . route in.

We’ve only been . flying it since the end of March and it’s already becoming very popular. 'After . the war you could buy an ex RAF Tiger Moth for £60 – or two for £100. They’ve gone up a bit now – we paid £57,000 for ours,' said Mr Flanagan. The 1930s designed, de Havilland DH82 Tiger Moth was a multi-role aircraft. In its different forms it was used as a trainer, for reconnaissance, and as a light bomber.
