Andrew MacDonald, full-back for RBS Regional West League side Strathendrick, grabbed the woman as she made her way to a waiting bus after the event at The Black Bull pub in Killearn, Stirlingshire.

Shamed: Andrew MacDonald, 23, full-back for RBS Regional West League side Strathendrick, grabbed the woman as she made her way to a waiting bus after the event at The Black Bull pub in Killearn, Stirlingshire . Sheriff Wyllie Robertson told MacDonald at Stirling Sheriff Court today that he acted in a way that was ‘nothing short of disgraceful’, telling him he was an ‘embarrassment’ to his parents. The sheriff also criticised him for ‘lying in the witness box’ and not being able to ‘control himself and act in a civilised way’ after drinking. He said: ‘You now accept you lifted up her skirt deliberately to amuse your friends and of course you lied in the witness box and made this girl go through giving evidence and cross examination. ‘Your behaviour was nothing short of disgraceful. You are no doubt an embarrassment to your parents. That night you took away that young girl's dignity, you left her distressed by what you did. ‘I find it's not the first time you acted in a sexual and criminal way. Your criminal record, while short, is concerning. You have been convicted of drink-driving and sexually abusing a young women.

Sentencing: Sheriff Wyllie Robertson told MacDonald at Stirling Sheriff Court today that he acted in a way that was 'nothing short of disgraceful' She said after he lifted her skirt she felt a ‘breeze’ on her bottom, adding: ‘I was really terrified. He picked me up. He lifted my skirt.’ MacDonald, an accounts manager, of Fintry, Stirlingshire, was found guilty of indecent assault - a charge he had denied. His solicitor, Harry Coughlan, said: ‘He . had a good day, and was high of spirits after success at sport, he had . taken some drink and accepts he acted in the matter liable. ‘He did not realise that his actions . caused so much upset and he regrets that, he never intended to cause . harm to his victim, he gave no thought to the consequences. He was known . as the class clown in school’. Sentencing him to 200 hours unpaid work and placing him under two years supervision, Sheriff Robertson said: ‘This conviction alone would not warrant a prison sentence. ‘But with your previous convictions and the way you acted a custodial sentence has to be considered. ‘I am bound to look at the alternatives and I will consider a community payback order with supervision of a social worker for two years and also 300 hours unpaid work in the community’. MacDonald refused to comment outside court.","Andrew MacDonald grabbed the woman as she made her way to a bus .

According to the Brooklyn Community's Monday night board meeting notes, the new Williamsburg location was among the borough's bars and restaurants applying for a full liquor license. And it's not the first time the retailer has expanded to food and drink; a shop in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, has a cafeteria-style eatery inside, and the company's Westport, Connecticut, location serves up fancy dishes like lamb merguez and striped sea bass at its in-store restaurant. Shop and drink: A new Urban Outfitters location coming soon to Brooklyn, New York, is applying for a full liquor license for an in-store bar - and perhaps a restaurant, too . Wendy McDevitt, president of Terrain - the outdoor living company run by Urban Outfitters - said adding food to the retailer's repertoire will be a guaranteed way of getting more business. 'Food is becoming bigger and bigger in terms of entertainment value,' she told New York Magazine. The new restaurant-cum-clothing store trend was initiated by Tommy Bahama, whose flagship Manhattan shop also has a full bar and a tropical-themed restaurant. Installing the restaurant in their shop has not only been convenient for shoppers, but it has also been a very lucrative move for the clothing company. In fact, chief executive officer Terry Pillow told Bloomberg Businessweek that Tommy Bahama's restaurant-stores generate two-and-a-half times the sales per square foot of their locations without food. J.C. Penney is also reportedly looking to get in on the craze by adding juice bars to hundreds of its locations over the next few years. Doug Wood, president of Tommy Bahama, says a bar within a shop is risky, but worth it. 'It's challenging to operate but if you execute it right it's magic,' he explained. It has not yet been revealed when the new Urban Outfitters shop will be open to the public.","The Brooklyn Community's .

But to keep hens in such royal luxury, you must be prepared to shell out an eye-watering £3,750. This hen house is being sold by Prince Charles’s Highgrove estate in Gloucestershire and is inspired by the birds he keeps there. The made-to-order Highgrove Hen House is built using Forest Stewardship Council-certified timber, which means it was sourced from a responsibly managed forest, and decorated with eggshell blue water-based paint. Palatial: The luxury hen house costs an eye-watering £3,750 . The roof is natural cedar, the wheels are cast iron and other fixtures are in galvanised steel. Each house sleeps four to eight chickens and features two nest boxes, adjustable perches and stable-style doors. Made by Wildlife World, a Gloucestershire firm, the hen houses are being sold on the Highgrove website which describes the design as ‘unique and innovative’. Proceeds – as with all items sold on the website – will go to charities supported  by Charles. But a spokesman for the prince admitted yesterday that none has yet been sold. ‘We only launched the hen house in March and we have had a lot of inquiries but no firm orders yet,’ said the spokesman, adding that the houses ‘reflect the interests of Highgrove’. ‘We are confident the hen houses will sell well, and especially at the time of the Christmas market.’ Eggspert: Prince Charles in patron of The Poultry Club of Great Britain . Highgrove’s website says: ‘Our very first Hen House has been inspired by the poultry kept on the Highgrove Estate by HRH The Prince of Wales, who is Patron of The Poultry Club of Great Britain.’ Highgrove is selling a matching beehive which, it says, ‘allows bees to live in an environment which is sustainable and low-impact, more akin to their natural environment’. The hive has a base trough filled with natural woodland material creating an enclosed natural ecosystem that allows beneficial insects to live in harmony with the bees. Charles has spoken publicly about the plight of the bee and, as well as keeping his own bees, supports beekeepers’ associations through The Prince’s Countryside Fund. Like the hen house, each beehive is bespoke, takes eight to 12 weeks to be produced and has a hefty price tag – each costs £1,250.","Luxury chicken shed inspired by poultry kept on the Prince's estate .

Restaurant customers ought to order smaller plates of chips, the Government's recycling advisers declared . Restaurant customers ought to order smaller plates of chips, the Government's recycling advisers have declared. They say that too many people leave cold fried potatoes uneaten on their plates - and as a result hundreds of thousands of tons of food waste each year have to be dumped by pubs, restaurants and fast food chains. They called for waiters to be trained to tell customers they ought to have less chips, and for 'stealth menus' designed to encourage diners to go for lighter meals. The campaign against chips was launched by the Waste and Resources Action Programme, a £30million-a-year quango set up to encourage more recycling. Its verdict that restaurant meals are too big and people ought to have fewer chips on their plate came just a day after a committee of MPs told families to stop eating meat on a daily basis. The Commons International Development Committee said people should eat less pork, lamb and beef because the country is never more than a few days away from a food shortage and because of the need to cut the amount of food thrown away. The WRAP recommendations on chips were greeted with hostility by the restaurant trade, which said it was impossible for waiters to tell customers to order short portions, because the customers would think the restaurant was trying to short-change them and diners would resent the implication that they were too fat. Richard Bradford of the Restaurant Association said: 'It's just not on. The customer is going to think the waiter is making a rude suggestion.' WRAP - which is financed by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs - based its chips verdict on a large-scale survey of more than 10,000 people. It also ran a more detailed survey of over 5,000 people and 12 focus groups. They called for waiters to be trained to tell customers they ought to have less chips, and for 'stealth menus' designed to encourage diners to go for lighter meals . It found that people go to . restaurants either to fuel up on food or for a social occasion, and that . just over a quarter of them leave food on the plate. Most of these were young women, the survey said. It . added: 'The main dish and the accompanying sides were the courses most . likely to be left; while the appetisers, starters and desserts were less . likely to be left. 'The staple foods that tend to get left at the end of the meal are chips, vegetables and salad. 'Chips, vegetables and salad are seen by . some customers as plate fillers rather than part of the meal they . ordered. Some do not even consider these food types, especially salad . garnishes, to be intended for consumption.' It said that the food most often left on the plate was chips and that 32 per cent of people who leave food leave chips. The survey quoted people who said they regarded chips as 'extras' and one man who said: 'I always leave the grass.' WRAP said that to solve the problem 'eating venues could train their staff so they are better able to talk about portion sizes with customers and provide more information on the meals, for example ingredients, cooking. 'As the research findings suggest, . portion sizes can, at times, be a sensitive subject so discretion and . skill need to be used when communicating relevant information to . customers.' Menus might offer different-sized meals . and dishes which 'would give customers more choice and empower them to . order the right amount.' But the document, Understanding Out . Of Home Consumer Food Waste, warned: 'Any messages or communication . initiatives developed need to be stealthy and subtle, as diners do not . want to be told what to do when out enjoying themselves nor do they want . to think about food waste when eating out.' They said that too many people leave cold fried potatoes uneaten on their plates - and as a result hundreds of thousands of tons of food waste each year have to be dumped . Stealth . menu suggestions made by the WRAP research include portion sizes marked . by three chillies, by numbers of scoops, by different sized plates, or . by a three bear system in which different-scale meals would be called . mummy bear, baby bear and daddy bear. However Mr Bradford, who runs Porters English Restaurant in Covent Garden, central London, said: 'Our waiters have to ask people what side orders they want. These are free. If they then ask if people want a smaller portion, customers are going to think we are trying to get away with giving them less. 'Then people will start thinking we are trying to tell them they are overweight. 'Soon we will have TripAdvisor saying we are being rude to the customers and trying to cheat them. Recommendations for smaller portions are just not something that can come from the waiting staff.' WRAP's annual budget from DEFRA reached £80million a year in the mid-2000s when the body was given a major role in persuading local councils to abandon weekly rubbish collections and replace them with fortnightly bin rounds and compulsory recycling. However it was blamed for helping create a backlash at the polls against councils who stopped weekly collections after it published a controversial series of recycling recommendations. These told councils to introduce fortnightly collections only in winter so there would be fewer unpleasant smells in the early months, and not to bring them in close to an election so that voters could not register a protest. Its budget is now down to £30million and has been under review in the early months of this year.","Waste and Resources Action Programme said too many people leave chips .

The coalition is to go to war with the trade unions, using reforms in the wake of the lobbying scandal to open up the membership of Labour's biggest financial backers. Downing Street revealed legislation will be rushed out before the summer recess, creating a new statutory register of lobbyists after an MP and three peers were embroiled in a new sleaze scandal after being recorded by undercover reporters offering to publicise causes in exchange for money. But the new laws will also include changes to election funding rules and tougher checks on union membership in an attempt to curb the influence of unions on British politics. Confrontation: The move to use new lobbying laws to target trade unions, which have opposed government spending cuts, is likely to prove controversial . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today promised to act to deal with the 'murkier side of . British politics'. Voters will be able to sack sleazy . MPs and lobbyists will be regulated, Mr Clegg vowed as he . insisted the government would act to 'clean up' British politics. The Deputy Prime Minister admitted . the two years left before the next election was not long enough to give . Westminster the overhaul it really needs. But the bill creating a lobbyists register will also include measures to end self-certification of union membership and reform third-party contributions to election campaigns. Under the new proposals, unions will be required to carry out an annual audit of their membership and demonstrate that the figures they produce are accurate. The Certification Officer will be given the power to conduct investigations into the numbers produced, which are vital when ballots on strike action are conducted. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg promised action to clean up 'murkier' aspects of British politics . And unions appear to be the main . target of the proposed changes to third-party election campaign funding, . which will apply to organisations affiliated to political parties as . those making major donations of more than £100,000. The reforms will ensure that the true . value of activities such as leaflet-printing is reflected when judging . whether parties have breached the £19 million cap on campaign spending . in the year before a general election, said No 10. When calculating the campaign . spending they must declare, organisations such as unions would have to . include not only the cost of printing a leaflet but also overheads such . as staffing and rent on premises - which could potentially inflate the . figure considerably. Mr Clegg said earlier that fresh allegations of wrongdoing highlighted the need for action. 'It's the political equivalent of groundhog day: MPs accused of abusing their position; businesses of getting too close,' he said. The coalition will press ahead with . promised plans for a power of recall, 'where any MP guilty of serious . misconduct could be forced to resign if enough of their constituents . wanted them to,' Mr Clegg said. There will also be a crackdown on lobbyists, including a statutory register. 'Clearly there are instances where . access is abused – further undermining the already weak public trust in . our institutions – and greater transparency is a key part of the . antidote,' Mr Clegg wrote in the Daily Telegraph. The crackdown comes after three members of the House of Lords were embroiled in a new sleaze scandal. In what was branded a ‘new low for . British politics’, Labour kicked out two peers and a third resigned from . the Ulster Unionists after they were recorded offering to do . parliamentary business in exchange for cash. Tory . Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude yesterday said the Government is . set to legislate to create a statutory register of lobbyists in this . session of Parliament – even though it was dropped from the recent . Queen’s Speech. ‘We are . going to do this,’ he said, adding that he would be ‘astonished’ if the . powers were not in place by the next general election in 2015. But today Mr Maude admitted the register would not have prevented the cases which have made headlines in recent days. The House of Lords is a 'stinking swamp' of corruption dominated by 'dirty money', a senior Lib Dem peer claimed today. Lord Oakeshott called for an end to foreign governments bankrolling All Party Parliamentary Groups. He said a register of lobbyists would be useful 'as far as it goes' but Lords and party funding reform was also needed. The Lib Dem told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I regard it a little bit like eradicating malaria in Africa, you use a bit of disinfectant on the mosquito, which a statutory register would be, but we have got to clean out the stinking swamp, which is particularly the House of Lords, where there is a very nasty whiff of dirty money the whole time.' He said rules must be changed to allow disgraced peers to be suspended for up to 10 years and called for all-party parliamentary groups to be reviewed.He later told MailOnline: 'I don't think we should have these groups paid for by foreign governments.' He singled out the Cayman Islands group, which receives support from the government in the renowned tax haven. 'That is a lobbying operation to stop us cracking down properly on the Cayman Islands. 'All-party groups like that make it more difficult for HMRC and the British government to collect the full amount of tax and make sure foreign companies pay the right tax.' 'The . statutory register of lobbyists would have made no difference in this . case at all because what’s alleged to have happened would have been . against the rules, parliamentary rules, in any event,' he told ITV's . Daybreak. However, Labour dismissed the plans as 'shabby' attempt to deflect attention from Tory embarrassment over the lobbying scandal. A Labour source: 'The best way to proceed if you want to take big money out of politics and clean up the lobbying scandal is to act on a cross-party basis. Labour has done so. 'This seems to be a shabby and panicked response by David Cameron to divert attention from a set of damaging headlines hitting the Conservative Party.' The . scandal escalated yesterday after Labour suspended two . peers for offering to assist undercover reporters who were posing as . lobbyists. Former Cabinet . minister Lord Cunningham – once known as ‘Junket Jack’ for his love of . the high life – and former senior police officer Lord Mackenzie of . Framwellgate denied wrongdoing. But they and Ulster Unionist Lord Laird . were all recorded discussing how, in return for payment, they could help . lobbyists representing a fake solar energy firm by pushing their . agenda. Today it was announced that the three peers will be investigated by the House of Lords standards commissioner has begun investigating the three peers caught up in a lobbying scandal. Leader of the House Lord Hill of Oareford described the allegations as 'very serious and distressing'. The Sunday Times . released a video of Lord Cunningham saying he would accept fees of . £12,000 a month – £144,000 a year – to ask parliamentary questions on . their behalf, and that he could ‘get other people to ask questions as . well’. He told undercover . reporters he offered ‘value for money’ because he could introduce them . to senior members of all three of the main political parties. Lord Mackenzie, a former president of . the Police Superintendents’ Association, said he could arrange parties . for paying clients on the terrace of the House of Lords. And he said he . could get around Lords rules requiring peers to declare financial . interests by asking ‘a colleague who has nothing to do with it, “would . you host a function for me?” ’. Lord Laird told undercover reporters . that, working together, peers could ask parliamentary questions for each . other’s clients, put down amendments in debates or write to ministers. He . was also embroiled in a second, separate sting operation after telling . reporters from BBC Panorama, who were posing as lobbyists, that he would . be interested in accepting a retainer of £2,000 a month to lobby for . Fiji. He indicated that he would use the promise of a trip to Fiji as a . ‘bribe’ in order to get others to join the group. He was recorded . saying: ‘I’ll deny having said this, but it’s a bribe.’ That undercover operation – in tandem with a second national newspaper – was the same one that exposed Newark MP Patrick Mercer, who resigned from the Conservative Party on Friday after accepting £4,000 to ask parliamentary questions. Mr Mercer said he agreed to be a consultant for work he said was outside parliament. But he submitted five parliamentary questions which were all answered, as well as an early day motion, all in relation to Fiji. Last night it was suggested that a legal complaint is expected to be issued to the police so Mr Mercer can be investigated for breaches of the Bribery Act. The House of Lords code of conduct says peers ‘must not seek to profit from membership of the House by accepting or agreeing to accept payment for providing parliamentary advice or services’. Lord Cunningham referred his own case to the Lords Commissioner for Standards and said he was consulting lawyers. He claims he ‘quickly became suspicious’ of the journalists. He added: ‘I told them I always stick to the rules and declare any interests. I informed them the next day that I wanted nothing more to do with them.’ Patrick Mercer MP has resigned as images of him meeting an undercover BBC Panorama reporter posing as a lobbyist were released . The MP allegedly signs a contract with the fake lobbying company set up by BBC Panorama . As the MP signs the contract he is recorded saying: 'Let's sign this, with pleasure.' Lord Laird added: ‘I wish to make it clear that I did not agree to act as a paid advocate in any proceedings of the House, nor did I accept payment or other incentive or reward in return for providing parliamentary advice or services.’ Lord Mackenzie said he was ‘quite happy’ that he had not broken the rules. ‘I went back to my office, I checked the codes of conduct and  I decided that it was getting a bit near the mark and I decided to decline the offer,’ he said. Shadow Defence Secretary Jim Murphy said the latest claims were ‘a new low for British politics’ and voters would be ‘sickened’. ‘The public, who have looked on with a sense of astonishment and with a sense that there is one rule for those who govern and another set of rules for those who are governed, will just be utterly sickened by it, and they are right to be sickened,’ he said.","Downing Street plans to rush legislation out before the summer .

"By . Jason Groves and Gerri Peev . PUBLISHED: . 18:21 EST, 3 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:39 EST, 4 June 2013 . More than 80 lobbyists have been suspended from the Palace of Westminster in a dramatic attempt to end the latest sleaze scandal. Commons Speaker John Bercow said scores of parliamentary passes are being investigated amid fears they have been used by private firms to gain access to politicians. He promised 'urgent and effective action' over the politicians-for-hire controversy. Commons Speaker John Bercow has suspended 80 lobbyists from the Palace of Westminster . The 83 passholders are connected to . all-party parliamentary groups, which act as 'special interest' talking . shops but have faced criticism for being a backdoor for lobbyists. Around half of these individuals are linked to lobbying firms. In a statement to the Commons Mr Bercow said today: 'As Speaker I have long felt that the operation of all party parliamentary groups needed to be improved to meet the high expectations of transparency and accountability required in public life. 'Recent events have heightened my concern and underlined the need for urgent and effective action.' More than 100 lobbying professionals are believed to have been handed parliamentary passes by members of the House of Lords. This gives them the right to roam the parliamentary estate unsupervised. Some 120 out of 660 people working for peers have also declared they are consultants or lobbyists for businesses and charities. At the same time, Downing Street announced that legislation for a statutory register of lobbyists would be rushed out next month. The new law will also strike directly at the ability of the trade unions to ramp up Labour's campaign machine in the run-up to the general election. It will also require unions to comply with potentially costly new regulations to ensure the membership lists they use for strike ballots are up to date. Ministers conceded that the statutory register of lobbyists – first promised three years ago – would not have prevented the latest scandal. Proposals to allow voters to 'recall' disgraced MPs will not be published until at least next year, meaning that dodgy MPs are highly unlikely to get kicked out before the next election. Downing Street said the proposals were part of a 'transparency agenda' to give the public more information about the impact of lobbying. A source said the 'modest' union reforms were simply designed to ensure strike ballots were valid and to close loopholes in the law that have enabled the unions to get round the £19million cap on party spending in election year. But Labour and the trade unions reacted furiously. A senior Labour source described the proposals as a 'shabby and panicked' response to the latest lobbying scandal. The proposals on trade union reform also appeared to catch the Liberal Democrats off guard. Deputy Commons Leader Tom Brake, who is technically in charge of the lobbying legislation, said the idea of a union clampdown was 'premature' when he was quizzed about the plans shortly after they were announced by Number 10. A Lib Dem source said the details of the proposed union crackdown had 'yet to be agreed' within the Coalition. Yesterday's move followed a fresh  round of lobbying scandals, which saw Conservative MP Patrick Mercer and an Ulster Unionist peer resigning the party whip and two Labour peers suspended after it was alleged  that they had breached parliamentary rules. Lord Hill, the Leader of the Upper House, said an investigation would be launched into the 'very serious and distressing' allegations of sleaze against Ulster Unionist Lord Laird, former Labour Cabinet minister Lord Cunningham and fellow Labour peer Lord Mackenzie of Framwellgate. The three, who all deny any wrongdoing and referred themselves to the standards watchdog, were caught in an undercover sting by Sunday Times reporters posing as lobbyists working for a fake energy firm. Lord Laird was also targeted, with Mr Mercer, in a separate sting by journalists posing as lobbyists for the Fijian government. Mr Mercer, who referred himself to the Commons Standards Commissioner, is alleged to have been paid £4,000 by the bogus lobbying firm and tabled parliamentary questions and a motion, offered a security pass and set up an all-party parliamentary group on Fiji. The Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott said the register was only a small step in clearing up the 'stinking swamp' of Westminster sleaze. He said: 'I regard it a little bit like eradicating malaria in Africa. You use a bit of disinfectant on the mosquito, which a statutory register would be, but we have got to clean out the stinking swamp, which is particularly the House of Lords, where there is a very nasty whiff of dirty money the whole time.' Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC, last night said the union law was 'naked opportunism', adding: 'The Government is cynically trying to exploit a political sleaze scandal to crack down on unions – which are democratic and accountable organisations.' But ministers believe the change will simply force the unions to  comply fully with the spending rules. They also hope it will shine  a light on Labour's dependency on union funding in the run-up to  the election.","The passholders are connected to all-party parliamentary groups .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:37 EST, 5 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 00:43 EST, 5 June 2013 . The alleged video of Toronto mayor Rob Ford smoking crack cocaine has apparently ‘gone’ according to one of the men involved in attempts to purchase it. News website Gawker launched a campaign last month to raise $200,000 from readers to purchase the footage from its Canadian proprietor. Ford was consumed by a . sea of media speculation after rumors of the video surfaced last month, . but he adamantly claimed that it didn't exist. Off the hook? The alleged video of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford smoking crack has apparently disappeared . The website opened a ‘Crackstarter’ page on crowdfunding platform Indiegogo and had raised the money by May 27, but days earlier had lost contact with the video’s owner. A still image - allegedly taken from the video - purportedly shows Ford with three men. On Tuesday Gawker Editor-in-Chief John Cook confirmed that the video might really be ‘gone’ after he received a call from a man who had been acting as his intermediary with the owner of the tape. ‘The owner was trying to sell the video,’ wrote Cook, ‘but he apparently didn't want or anticipate the media circus that erupted after the story broke.’ Scandal: A still image allegedly taken from the video given to the Globe and Mail and Gawker.com purportedly shows Ford with two men, one of whom is believed to have been murdered over the video . It was Ford who on May 16 claimed to have seen video of Ford smoking a crack pipe, which he said belonged to drug dealer linked to Ford. The owner of the video had been identified as a Somali man by the Toronto Star and according to Cook the man was also being pressurized by Toronto's ethnic Somali community to make the video disappear. Cook had been dealing with an intermediary who called him last Friday to say he had finally heard from the owner. Cook wrote: ‘And his message was: ""It's gone. Leave me alone."" It was, the intermediary told me, a short conversation.’ If the video . fails to turn up 'soon,' Gawker will donate the money raised to 'a Canadian nonprofit that . addresses substance abuse issues.' Pout: Vacated by his communications staffers and facing drug allegations, Ford has clearly seen better days . Rumors: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford (right) said on a talk show hosted by his brother City Councillor Doug Ford that a video of him allegedly smoking crack cocaine does not exist . On May 24, Ford denied during a press . conference that he smoked crack cocaine, and insisted that video of him . engaging in the illicit act did not exist. However, . the Toronto Star reported that Ford had earlier met with staffers to . assure them such a video was no cause for concern because ""he knew where . it was."" Speaking two weeks ago on a weekly radio show that he hosts with his brother Doug Ford, a city council member, Rob Ford reiterated that the allegations were ridiculous, but he didn't say whether he has ever used crack. Reports on Gawker and in the Toronto Star claimed the videoo was taken by men who said they had sold the drug to Ford. The Star reported that two . journalists had watched a video that appears to show Ford, sitting in a . chair, inhaling from what appears to be a glass crack pipe. The Star said it did not obtain the video or pay to watch it. Fundraising: On Monday, Gawker successfully raised more than $200,000 in its 'Crackstarter' campaign to purchase the video . When asked by a caller to the show if it was him in the video, Ford responded: 'Number one: There's no video, so that's all I can say. You can't comment on something that doesn't exist.' Ford called the allegations false and said good journalists are 'few and far between'. 'A bunch of maggots,"" Ford said, quickly adding that he shouldn't have said that. In a press conference today, he apologized for the remark. Some critics called on Ford to step down, but he has vowed to seek re-election next year. 'I'll be the first putting my name on that ballot,' he said. Doug Ford is also facing drug allegations after another leading Canadian newspaper published Saturday the results of what it called a lengthy investigation into the Ford family's past that revealed 'a portrait of a family once deeply immersed in the illegal drug scene'. The Globe and Mail, citing anonymous sources who were involved in the drug trade, alleged that the mayor's older brother sold hashish for several years in the 1980s in the Toronto suburb of Etobicoke, where the family grew up. Doug Ford, 48, is an influential adviser to the mayor. 'I was not a dealer of hashish in the 1980s,' Doug Ford said on Sunday's radio show. Standing tall: Ford, with his wife, second left, and two friends, said he will be the first to put his name on a ballot for re-election . The mayor has been embroiled in almost weekly controversies about his behavior since being elected in 2010. The Toronto Star reported earlier this year that the mayor was asked to leave a gala fundraiser for wounded Canadian soldiers because he appeared intoxicated. During his campaign for mayor, Rob Ford vehemently denied a 1999 arrest for marijuana possession in Florida, but later acknowledged it was true after he was presented with evidence. He pleaded guilty to driving under the influence and failing to give a breath sample to police. While in office, he has been accused of flouting conflict of interest rules and making obscene gestures at residents from his car. The controversy has drawn comparisons to the 1990 arrest of then-Washington Mayor Marion Barry, who was videotaped smoking crack cocaine in a hotel room during an FBI sting operation. Barry served six months in federal prison on a misdemeanor drug possession conviction but later won a fourth term as mayor in 1994.","One of the men involved in attempts to purchase the video says he has been told that it is no longer available .

"By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 11:14 EST, 18 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:52 EST, 18 April 2013 . Case: Rafal Nowak is accused of murdering 23-year-old business analyst Catherine Wells-Burr for her six-figure life insurance policy . A 'possessive' Polish factory worker accused of murdering his British girlfriend had tearfully begged her: 'Don't leave me' in the months before he allegedly killed the 23-year-old, her father told a court today. Rafal Nowak, 31, was frightened that Catherine Wells-Burr would leave him before he smothered her at their home in Chard, Somerset, a jury heard. It is alleged Nowak then left their home before his lover Anna Julia Lagwinowicz, 32, and her uncle Tadevsz Dmytryszyn, 38, removed her body and burned it in a nearby field. The three Polish nationals deny murdering Bath Spa business graduate in September last year. Bristol Crown Court today heard evidence from her father Philip Wells-Burr, who worked at the Numatic factory in Chard alongside his daughter and her partner. He described Nowak, who has a wife and son in Poland, as 'possessive' and that the Pole would bombard business analyst Miss Wells-Burr with phone calls. Catherine's parents said they treated Nowak 'like a son'  and allowed him to sleep 'at the end of their bed' and comforted him after their daughter's death, the court was told. In a statement given to police, Mr Wells-Burr said: 'I felt he was quite possessive of her. She didn't get out with her old friends much. 'It was too much calling when she was supposed to be working.' Family: Philip Wells-Burr, Catherine's father, arrives at Bristol Crown Court to give evidence, accompanied by Jayne Wells-Burr (centre), Catherine's mother, and Leanne Wells-Burr . Mr Wells-Burr also recalled witnessing Nowak cry when he thought Miss Wells-Burr was going to leave him, months before her death. The witness said Nowak had become upset when Miss Wells-Burr had a heated telephone conversation with her mother, something that prompted the Polish national to believe his partner was going to leave him. Mr Wells-Burr said: 'I said to just leave them be (Miss Wells-Burr and her mother), let mother and daughter sort out their problems.' He said he later saw Nowak crying about the situation and told him to 'grow up'. 'Catherine wasn't very happy,' Mr Wells-Burr said. 'That's when he came downstairs all sorry, begging and saying: ""Don't leave me"".' The court heard how Nowak's former partner Anna . Lagwinowicz (left) and her uncle Tadevsz Dmytryszyn (right) dumped Miss . Well-Burr's body in a car which was then set on fire . The court heard a previous attempt to kill the 23-year-old Bath Spa University graduate on September 10 had to be cancelled at the last minute when Miss Wells-Burr's sleep was disturbed by a phone call from a wrong number. The court heard concern was raised for Miss Wells-Burr (pictured) when she did not arrive at Numatic International, where her parents, sister Leanne and boyfriend Nowak also worked . Earlier that day, Nowak and Miss Wells-Burr had been for Sunday lunch around at her father's house. He told the court the pair had acted differently that day, they weren't their usual 'lovey dovey' selves. Prosecutors allege the trio created a fake trail of text messages with a 'mystery man', implying Miss Wells-Burr was having an affair with an unidentified man who was responsible for her death. But police quickly identified clues allegedly pointing to Nowak, the 'bitter' and 'jealous' Lagwinowicz and her doting uncle. The court was told Nowak was arrested soon after the investigation was launched, but went to stay with Mr Wells-Burr when he was released on bail. Asked whether Nowak 'had ever mentioned Catherine' during the day he was with the grieving father, . Mr Wells-Burr replied: 'Not once.' The court heard concern was raised . for Miss Wells-Burr when she did not arrive at Numatic International, . where her parents, sister Leanne and boyfriend Nowak also worked. Richard . Smith QC, prosecuting, said Nowak initially told a colleague he had not . heard from Miss Wells-Burr and stated she had received a text saying . 'if I can't have you nobody can' from a mystery man. He . later recounted the text to her parents, Phil and Jayne, at the factory . as they gathered to work out where Miss Wells-Burr was, while her . sister Leanne went to their home in Chard to look for her. Mr . Smith said: 'She wasn't answering her phone, she hadn't come in and her . car wasn't there. Nowak and Catherine's parents set off in a car to . [their home] and met Leanne there. Prosecutors allege Nowak smothered Miss Wells-Burr with a pillow as she lay sleeping in their new home in Chard, Somerset in September last year, Bristol Crown Court (pictured) has heard . 'The police were contacted. She was nowhere to be found. As they waited the arrival of the police Nowak spoke to Jayne. 'He . said ""I lost my world, I have lost my future"". It struck Jayne as being . rather odd at the time because by that point Catherine was missing.' Police . discovered Miss Wells-Burr's body in her red Ford Focus car a few hours . later and arrived to break the news to her parents. Mr Smith added: 'Leanne and Nowak waited in the kitchen. Nowak remarked that he felt they were both suspects.' Officers arrested Nowak later that day but released him due to his alibi and a lack of other evidence. Mr Smith added: 'He was released to spend the night with the parents of the girl that he had murdered. 'They welcomed him back and let him sleep at the end of their bed, worried about him.' But he was later re-arrested and charged with her murder after officers uncovered the 'evil' plan, Mr Smith said. The three defendants did not confess to their part in the killings when interviewed by police. Nowak, of Willow Way, Chard, Lagwinowicz, of South Street, Taunton, and Dmytryszyn, of Holway Avenue, Taunton, deny murder. The trial continues.

Free: Former policewoman Ceri Rees, 35, has been cleared of stealing a mobile phone from a casino after a jury decided she was too drunk to know what she was doing . A former policewoman has been cleared of stealing a mobile phone from a casino after a jury decided she was too drunk to know what she was doing. Ceri Ann Rees, 35, was filmed by CCTV cameras as she walked through a door marked 'staff only,' at Aspers casino in Swansea during a night celebrating a colleague's retirement. The 35-year-old was seen rummaging through two handbags before returning to the restaurant area with an iPhone and a charger. Rees, then a serving officer with Dyfed Powys police, stuffed the phone down her top before slumping onto her side. Her colleague, policewoman Samantha Dawson, put her hand down Rees' dress and retrieved the phone after Rees had been challenged by casino staff. Rees was then arrested and charged with burglary - because she had entered an area of Aspers casino which was not open to the public. Rees, of Llanelli, South Wales, denied the charge, saying she could not remember even being in the casino. The court heard said she did not dispute what the . casino staff had seen but said she was 'adamant' she had no . intention of stealing the phone. At Swansea Crown Court today, a jury took just 40 minutes to find her unanimously not guilty after deciding she was too drunk to form the intent to steal. Rees, who has since been dismissed by Dyfed Powys Police, left the court without commenting. She broke down in tears on hearing the verdict. The trial had previously heard how she  and Mrs Dawson had gone to the Pumphouse pub in Swansea on October 2, 2011, to celebrate a colleague's retirement. She drank single vodkas in the pub before moving onto double vodkas in the Bank Statement pub - which is the last thing she could remember. Rees then went on to the casino with Mrs Dawson to carry on drinking vodka. On camera: The 35-year-old was seen rummaging through two handbags before returning to the restaurant area with an iphone and a charger . Drunk: Ceri Ann Rees, 35, was filmed by CCTV cameras and watched by staff as she walked through a door marked 'staff only,' at Aspers casino in Swansea . Francis Jones, prosecuting, told the . court that Rees and PC Dawson ordered a three course meal but Rees . suddenly got up and said she was going to the toilet. Instead, she went through a door . marked 'staff only,' down a corridor and into an area of the casino . where staff left their personal belongings before starting work. Rees was followed back to her seat by another casino worker, Adam Bergamo, who asked for the phone back. Rees, said Mr Jones, had hidden the phone down her top but it was retrieved by Mrs Dawson. Mr Jones said at that point Rees slumped over and began to cry. Boozy: Rees had gone to the Pumphouse pub in Swansea to celebrate a colleague's retirement before visiting the casino. She drank single vodkas in the pub . Police were called and Rees told officers she could not explain how the phone became hidden in her dress. She told them: ""I'm a police officer for God's sake. Why would I do something so stupid?"" Police arrested Rees but she became so . inconsolable that a doctor had to be called to assess whether she was . fit to be interviewed. Rees, of Panteg, Llanelli, west Wales, said she could not remember taking the 'phone or explain why she had. The 35-year-old admitted having a drink problem and said: 'I don't know when to stop - I don't have an off button.' She said she could remember drinking double vodkas in a pub and then waking up under a blanket in a police cell the following morning. 'It was my worst nightmare,' she said. 'I rubbed my eyes hoping that when I opened them again I would be somewhere else.' Rees told the jury it was not the first time she had done something stupid after drinking. Once, she had telephoned a police sergeant and claimed to have been assaulted. 'I was given appropriate words of advice,' she explained. Rees told the jury she had been sacked two months after the incident for misconduct. She said she did not dispute what casino staff said she had done, or what the CCTV cameras had recorded, but said she had never intended to permanently deprive casino worker Ceinwen Jones of her mobile and charger. The owner of Aspers Casino, Damian Aspinall, is pictured when the casino first opened . In her police statement Rees admitted . she may have a problem with alcohol and recounted incidents where she . had forgotten drunken incidents. She had no recollection of singing karaoke on one night out and had failed to get upstairs to bed on another night. Rees . also told police she had once called 999 to report being assaulted but . when officers arrived she could not remember calling them - or the . incident. Asked if she had ever stolen anything, she said she once took some mints when she was aged four.

Plea: David Cameron used a speech in Stirling today to invoke the D-Day landings and the Olympics as he appealed for Brits to 'face the future together' The Tory leader's intervention follows claims from Deputy SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon that Scotland and the rest of the UK could be the ‘closest of allies and the best of neighbours’ if there is a ‘yes’ vote in next year’s referendum. In a speech at Edinburgh University last night, Miss Sturgeon said the model of the Nordic Council that brings Scandinavian countries together could be adopted post-independence. Her suggestion is the latest attempt by the SNP to ease fears about separation, with the party previously announcing plans to keep the Queen as head of state and use the British pound. But a spokesman for the anti-independence Better Together campaign last night rejected the SNP’s vision and said: ‘The idea that separation actually means co-operation is like arguing that black is white.’ Mr Cameron also warned that ‘breaking-up Britain’ is not the answer to the country’s problems. Tory activists gathered in Stirling . today, where Scottish leader Ruth Davidson faces pressure to . unite the party behind her. Some MSPs are known to be concerned about . her leadership approach, and a large number of members are worried about . her new-found support for further devolution. But Mr Cameron praised Miss Davidson when he took to the stage.

Mr Cameron said there is ‘still so much more to come’. ‘Why wouldn’t we want to face the future together?’ he asked. ‘There . is simply no challenge we face today where breaking-up Britain is the . right answer. The future I see for Scotland is part of a dynamic, . enterprising, prosperous, compassionate Britain. ‘A . Britain that isn’t just competing in the global race, but winning in . the world. A country where we are pulling together, not pulling apart.’ But . Miss Sturgeon last night claimed that independence would create a . ‘healthier relationship’ between Scotland and the rest of the UK. SNP . leader Mr Salmond added: ‘The people of Scotland want and deserve a . quality debate on Scotland’s future – and Nicola Sturgeon’s positive . speech about the relationship of equality we seek with our friends south . of the Border stands in stark contrast to the fears and smears that are . all we have heard from the No campaign so far. ‘It . is time for the No campaign to draw a line in the sand under their . fears and smears about Scotland, and fulfil their pledge to pursue a . positive campaign based on reality.’ Mr Cameron also invoked the Olympic success of Scots including Sir Chris Hoy and scientific breakthroughs, including Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin, as proof that the United Kingdom has a history of shared endeavour . Mr Salmond also called for a head-to-head debate with the Prime Minister – something the ‘No’ campaign has rejected because Mr Cameron is ineligible to vote in the referendum. Instead, Better Together leader Alistair Darling has offered to debate with the First Minister. Responding to Miss Sturgeon’s speech, a campaign spokesman said last night: ‘There already exists a strong vehicle for co-operation across our island. It’s called the UK and it works well.’ Scotland Office minister David Mundell added: ‘The Deputy First Minister’s speech ignores the fact that Scotland and the rest of the UK are already the closest of allies and best of neighbours. We are part of the same UK family and leaving it would end a successful 300-year partnership.’ Meanwhile, First Minister Alex Salmond yesterday met outgoing Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King in Edinburgh. The talks came amid an ongoing row over the currency options facing an independent Scotland, with senior Westminster figures warning that Mr Salmond’s bid to share the pound is ‘unlikely’. No details of yesterday’s meeting were released.","Prime Minister invokes Normandy landings 69 years after they began .

Three men, including an 81 year old, have been arrested by police investigating a paedophile ring who drugged, raped and sold schoolgirls into prostitution. They were held today after officers raided the Nanford Guest House in Oxford, in connection with Operation Bullfinch, which was set up to break-up gangs of abusers. Seven members of a paedophile ring from . the city are already facing long jail terms after being found guilty at the Old . Bailey last month of a catalogue of offences, including conspiracy to . rape, child prostitution and trafficking over an eight-year period. Police raid: Officers outside the Nanford Guest House in Oxford, which is being searched in connection with child exploitation and where three men were arrested this morning . They had showered vulnerable children from care homes or the streets with gifts and attention, before grooming them, abusing them and selling them on into prostitution around the country. The three men arrested today also included a 48 year old and a 49 year old, who were taken away by police along with the 81-year-old suspect. They were held on suspicion of 'being a landlord letting a premise for use as a brothel, causing or inciting child prostitution for gain and encouraging or assisting in an offence believing it will be committed, namely rape and causing child prostitution'. A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: 'The warrant is in relation to information that came to light during the recent trial at the Old Bailey where evidence was heard that the guest house had been used to facilitate child sexual exploitation.' The three men were all in custody this morning. The warrant was executed at the guest house under section 8 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. Officers also raided another property in Sunningwell, Oxford, police added. Last month, two sets of brothers, Akhtar Dogar, 32, and Anjum Dogar, 31, and Mohammed Karrar, 38, and Bassam Karrar, 33, were convicted with Kamar Jamil, 27, Assad Hussain, 32, and Zeeshan Ahmed, 27. Brothers Bassam Karrar (left) and Mohammed Karrar (right) were found guilty of being part of a paedophile sex ring at the Old Bailey  last month . They will be sentenced on June 26. Two . other defendants - Mohammed Hussain, 25, and a man who cannot be named . for legal reasons - were cleared. Assad Hussain was cleared of raping Child A but convicted of having sex with a child . At . the end of the harrowing case, police and social workers apologised to . the victims for failing to rescue them as it emerged that officers . missed several chances to catch gang members before they were finally . arrested. Some victims . relived their ordeals during the four-month trial, describing how they . were groomed, beaten, betrayed and sold into prostitution around the . country. One was still . so frightened of her attackers that she refused to give evidence for . fear of reprisals. It was only after she was given legal advice that . Girl D agreed to tell her story on a videolink from another room in the . building. She had been . raped and prostituted at 11 by Mohammed Karrar, who bought her gifts and . showed her the first affection she had known. Another victim, Girl A, complained of her plight to police on two occasions but no one was charged. A . care home manager refused to pay her taxi fare when she returned after . absconding. The then 14-year-old was driven back to Oxford to be raped. The carer was later sacked and the privately run home where girls were placed by Oxford County Council was closed down. Brothers Anjum Dogar (left) and Akhtar Dogar (right) have been convicted of offences involving underage girls . Zeeshan Ahmed (left) and Kamar Jamil (right) were among those convicted at the Old Bailey last month . The . girls had been put into care because their behaviour was out of control . and for their own protection. Time after time, they disappeared from . children’s homes and were caught with older men by police, but the . exploitation continued. The six girls said they had been victims of men in the Cowley area of Oxford while aged between 11 and 15. The . gang was finally arrested after police and social services got together . to form Operation Bullfinch. By speaking to complainants and looking at . their histories, they realised they were dealing with an organised . grooming gang. Girls . were either threatened that they or their families would be harmed, or . brainwashed into thinking they were betraying their lover if they talked . to police. The trial . followed the jailing last year of men in Rochdale for abusing vulnerable . girls, another case where chances to stop the gang were missed. Earlier . this year the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Crown . Prosecution Service announced new measures to improve their response to . sexual offending, particularly involving children.

"By . Lisa Sewards . PUBLISHED: . 17:12 EST, 5 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:12 EST, 5 June 2013 . Back to his roots: the Reggae Reggae Sauce creator at Brixton Market, close where he grew up . British-Jamaican chef, musician and entrepreneur Levi Roots is adamant that the key to turning rags into riches is having a mentor. And he should know, he’s had a few – from the prison worker who convinced him to leave a life of crime behind, to Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones, who created a global brand from Levi’s Reggae Reggae Sauce. Now he’s passing his advice on to schoolchildren on his nationwide School Of Life Tour, which aims to get young people excited about cooking and making music, as well as motivating them to succeed. ‘I want to show them it doesn’t matter what your background is – if you work hard and are determined you can be a success,’ he says. Back in 2007, wearing his sharpest suit and his most infectious smile, Levi serenaded the stars of Dragons’ Den with his Reggae Reggae Sauce song. His performance secured him a £50,000 investment in return for 40 per cent of the business from Dragons Peter Jones and Richard Farleigh. Almost immediately Sainsbury’s announced it would be stocking Levi’s sauce in 600 of its stores, and within weeks it became its fastest-selling product. The Reggae Reggae brand now has some 50 products, from table sauces to soft drinks, rocketing Levi to multi-millionaire status. ‘Peter saw beyond the sauce and was sold on my song,’ laughs Levi, 54. ‘He’s the most important mentor in my life. He made the crucial phone call that got the sauce into Sainsbury’s. 'It . was surreal going from selling the sauce on a market stall to seeing . them on shelves all over the country. It was the most amazing thing . that’s happened to me.’ But it was a long slog. Levi had been . selling the sauce himself from market stalls since 1991 while trying to . make it as a musician, having been rejected for loans from banks for 16 . years on the grounds that the sauce sounded ‘too black’. It was when he started to feel the pinch with his seven children that he realised he had to change tack. ‘The time came when I realised I wasn’t making any money, so I decided . to merge the music and food and give a bit of soul to the sauce. And . I’ve never looked back, thanks to Peter.’ Peter was the one who warned Levi that success also brings trouble. On . the show Levi claimed the secret recipe for his sauce was handed down . by his grandmother Miriam. But his former business partner, chef Tony . Bailey, accused Levi of stealing the recipe the pair used when they ran a . stall at Notting Hill Carnival. 'Peter saw beyond the sauce': Levi Roots with his mentor Peter Jones, who created a global brand from Levi's Reggae Reggae Sauce . Bailey attempted to sue Levi for more than £600,000, but Levi won the case in 2011 after the judge ruled he didn’t steal the recipe. Levi says he feels no cause to celebrate. ‘Peter always told me my story was too good to be true and to be prepared for someone to throw a spanner at me. But I never expected the spanner to be thrown from so close to home. I still feel hurt.’ Levi was born Keith Valentine Graham in Jamaica, the youngest of six raised by his grandmother, as his elder siblings moved to the UK, one by one, after his parents came to Britain to start a new life. ‘As they established themselves here they could afford to bring one child over each year. But as I was the youngest, I was the last to arrive. So my grandmother brought me up. 'She was too poor to send me to school but she taught me to cook. We lived entirely off fresh fruit, herbs and spices from the garden and although there was no money, there were always good meals on the table. ‘Food and music have always gone hand . in hand for me. When I was playing, food was always there. I’d be . rustling up dishes in a pot and pan in the dressing room when we were on . tour.’ 'We cooked outside all the time,’ says Levi, whose latest book, Grill It With Levi: 101 Reggae Recipes For Sunshine And Soul, is close to his heart as it concentrates on the Caribbean traditions of barbecuing and grilling. Although in the court case Levi admitted it was a marketing ploy to claim the Reggae Reggae sauce recipe was his grandmother’s, he says, ‘My grandmother taught me how to cook and one of the key things in Caribbean cooking is jerk chicken sauce. So I learnt how she did it and later perfected the recipe at home over many years.’ At the age of 12, his parents sent for him to join them in Brixton, south London. ‘When I arrived I couldn’t spell my own name. At school I just tried to be cool by showing everyone I could open a bottle of pop without a bottle opener, as I couldn’t read or write. My mum took me to the library where I learnt to read from the Famous Five books. ‘But at home, the kitchen was my haven. Mum was busy working and my father worked nights as a rat catcher for the council, and as he went to work at 6pm, I’d have to cook dinner for him: classic Caribbean dishes I’d learnt from my grandmother, like goat curry, dumplings and soups.' Levi's School of Life Tour combines tips on how to succeed in business, a cookery lesson and a flavour of his music . Despite this homely life, Levi says . he was drawn into a life of crime as he grew up in Brixton in the 1970s . while trying to carve out a career in music. Special sauce: Levi's popular Reggae Regae Sauce has made him a multi-millionaire . Aged . 15 he was sent to Pentonville prison for six months charged with . assault on a police officer. In 1986, police raided the youth club he . ran and he was jailed again for possession of drugs. ‘In prison I met a woman who really . inspired me. She taught prisoners how to get ready for the outside world . and she said to me, “You’re not Keith. Keith is bad and gets into . trouble.” 'So as I lay in my prison cell bed I left behind Keith Graham and became known by my Rastafarian name, Levi Roots.’ Deciding to stay on the right side of the law, Levi persevered with his music. He formed a band called Matic 16, performed with James Brown and was nominated for a Best Reggae Act MOBO award in 1998. ‘Food and music have always gone hand in hand for me. When I was playing, food was always there. I’d be rustling up dishes in a pot and pan in the dressing room when we were on tour.’ Levi’s ongoing School Of Life Tour follows Government proposals for compulsory cookery lessons for pupils aged seven to 14 to be introduced from 2014. ‘If you can combine your two passions you have the best job in the world. That’s what I tell all the pupils I see,’ says Levi, whose tailor-made school visits include a flavour of his music, some tips on how to succeed in business and a cookery lesson. ‘Too many youngsters see cooking as dull or laborious, which is just not true. And I tell them everyone needs a mentor. I’ve been in business for five years now and the Reggae Reggae products have sold millions – but I still have a mentor in Peter Jones.’ For more information on Levi Roots’ School of Life Tour, visit www.reggae-reggae.co.uk.

MPs have attacked Richard Alderman for racking up nearly £25,000 in one year flying business class and staying in five-star hotels . The former boss of the Serious Fraud Office racked up nearly £25,000 in a single year by flying business class and staying in five-star hotels. At the same time his cash-strapped agency struggled with cuts. MPs have attacked Richard Alderman for spending 52 days out of the country during his last full year as director of the fraud-fighting agency. The Commons Public Accounts Committee . launched an investigation after it learned that Mr Alderman had given . three members of staff severance deals worth more than £1million paid by . the Serious Fraud Office. The . watchdog accused him of 'slovenly, sloppy' leadership as he . stayed in five-star hotels at a time when his agency faced accusations about cronyism . and struggled to deal with sharp budget cuts. Records . obtained by The Times show that the director visited Shanghai, . Marrakech, Manila, and went to Washington three times in six months. On . one trip he flew business class to Moscow, stayed in a five-star hotel . near the Kremlin, and caught a train to St Petersburg, as part of a trip . to attend anti-corruption seminars. His four-day trip cost the SFO £3,389, according to the newspaper. Usually . he went on the invitation of non-government agencies and law firms to . to discuss the UK's anti-bribery laws, The Times reported. The Committee began the probe after the National Audit Office (NAO) previously refused to approve the SFO's accounts. Records show that the director visited Shanghai, Marrakech, Manila, and went to Washington three times in six months . An . 'irregular' pension and severance payment of £422,000 was made to . Philippa Williamson, the SFO's former chief executive officer, last . year, and two other SFO employees also understood to have received large . payments. The Cabinet Office had not approved the payments made by the SFO - the independent body that investigates corruption. Margaret . Hodge, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, has also asked that the . NAO carries out a broader investigation into the payments, according to . The Times. In Ferbuary Hodge has condemned the payments - deemed 'irregular' by the NAO, as 'this sweetheart deal outside of official Treasury procedures'. The NAO said that this expenditure was 'not in conformity with the authorities which govern it and is, therefore, irregular'. Hodge said: 'The SFO showed a total disregard for taxpayers' money when it wrote out a five-figure cheque and failed to provide valid justification for the payment.' In March Shadow Attorney-General Emily Thornberry said that current SFO chief David Green had asked for an independent investigation but that its findings were not released. Mr Green sought legal advice when entering office about the deals that concluded the payments  were binding and that the money could not be recovered. At the time the SFO said the payments had been approved before Mr Green took the position and he had no prior knowledge of them. Mr Alderman, a former barrister, was director of the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) between April 2008 and April 2012. The SFO is responsible in the UK for the most complex investigations and prosecutions relating to fraud and overseas corruption. An SFO spokesman said: 'The foreign travel arrangements for Mr Alderman throughout his tenure as director of the SFO were decisions made by him to meet what he judged to be appropriate in the execution of his public duty. 'He answered questions on this topic when he appeared before the Public Accounts Committee on March 7 this year.'","Richard Alderman flew around the world while SFO suffered sharp cuts .

It's nickname may be the 'Great Red Island' - but Madagascar's stunning wildlife is anything but one-dimensional. The country's colourful plants and animals are as varied as the natural world gets. British photographer Dale Morris visited the country to document dozens of species, including chameleons, lemurs and unusual insects like the giraffe-necked weevil. He said: 'I lost count of how many animals I photographed. Every day was a photographer's dream. Madagascar is absolutely unique in every way. It's like no other place on earth.'

Madagascar is the world's fourth largest Island and is three-and-a-half times the size of Great Britain. It is is known as the 'Great Red Island' because large amounts of iron in its soil gives the earth a rusty colour. Its diverse landscape includes . rain-forests, sloping highlands and tropical dry-forests and much of its . flora and fauna is unique to the island.

In danger: The photographer wants to raise awareness about the rate at which forests and jungles are being destroyed on the island . Mr Morris, 40, who is originally from London but now lives in South Africa, had no trouble getting the animals to pose for him. He said: 'Much to my surprise, many of the nocturnal species were unafraid of me. 'I would venture into the forests with . a local guide and a flash light and there we would begin searching for . chameleons, giant geckos, tree frogs, snakes, owls and night lemurs. 'The chameleons and geckos were . particularly accommodating models and stayed perfectly still for me even . when I was right up close.' But perhaps the animals should have been a bit more hesitant as Mr Morris, who was suffering from food poisoning, accidentally vomited on one unfortunate tree frog he was trying to photograph.

Afghanistan could slip back into the hands of extremists and pose a terrorist threat to  the West when Western troops leave, experts have warned. David Cameron claimed at a Nato summit yesterday that plans for withdrawal by the end of December 2014 are ‘on track and on target’. Barack Obama went even further, declaring that the allies would soon be able to say: ‘The Afghan war as we know it is over.’ 'The war is over': President Barack Obama, accompanied by Prime Minister David Cameron, speaking during the meeting on Afghanistan during the NATO Summit in Chicago yesterday . But despite those optimistic statements, the U.S. commander of Nato’s troops said they would have to fight their way out of the country. A senior British official also conceded that it was ‘unrealistic’ to assume Afghanistan ‘is going to be completely secure’ or that there would be ‘no possibility of a terrorist threat re-emerging’. Yesterday’s summit was designed to set out a final timetable for the handover to Afghan security forces, which will lead all combat operations by mid-2013. General John Allen said he ‘fully expects that combat is going to continue’ past that milestone. ‘There is no end of combat before the end of 2014,’ he added. ‘And in fact, the Taliban will oppose the Afghan National Security Forces after 2014.’ He went on to warn that Nato may need to send more troops to Helmand province, where British forces are currently stationed, if extremists seize ground vacated by the allies. All smiles: Mr Obama greets participants during the Meeting with Partners event at the Nato Summit. Despite his remarks, experts warned that it was unrealistic to expect Afghanistan to be completely free of terrorism . Round table: Mr Obama is seen speaking on-screen at the meeting yesterday, which was designed to set out a final timetable for the handover to Afghan security forces, which will lead all combat operations by mid-2013 . Mr Obama, presiding over a 50-nation war coalition summit in his hometown, summed up the mood by saying the Afghanistan that will be left behind will be stable enough for them to depart - essentially good enough after a decade of war- but still loaded with troubles. 'I don't think there's ever going to be an optimal point where we say, ""This is all done. This is perfect. This is just the way we wanted it,''' Mr Obama said. 'This is a process, and it's sometimes a messy process.' Afghan forces for the first time will take over the lead of the combat mission by the middle of 2013, a milestone moment in a long, costly transition of control. Even in a backup role, U.S. forces and all the rest will face surprise attacks and bombings until the war's end. War torn country: Afghan security forces rush to the site of a battle in Kabul. Even if the withdrawal goes to plan, British taxpayers will bankroll the Afghan security forces for years to come . The partners are in essence staying the course on Afghanistan. They stuck with a timeline long established and underscored that there will be no second-guessing the decision about when to leave. Questioned about what will happen if Afghanistan eventually falls apart, Mr Obama signalled that there is no turning back. 'I think that the timetable that we've established is a sound one, it is a responsible one. Are there risks involved in it? Absolutely.' Unrest: Hundreds of protesters, many affiliated with the Occupy Wall Street movement, demonstrate in front of the Boeing headquarters on the second day of the NATO summit yesterday . Mr Cameron insisted that British troops will have completed their mission and can leave ‘with their heads held high’ – but he conceded that Western leaders would not control the country’s fate. ‘British troops will no longer be in a combat role beyond the end of 2014,’ he said. ‘That is our deadline. And at this summit, Nato confirmed it will be the deadline for the ISAF [International Security Assistance Force] mission. 'The plan for the transition of full security responsibility from ISAF to the Afghan National Security Forces is on track and on target.’","'The Afghan war as we know it is over,' declares President Obama .

New details emerged this week during a preliminary hearing for a Tennessee man accused of shooting dead his 34-year-old wife in the family home while his two-year-old child was left alone upstairs in a crib. The court heard that Randolph Maidens, 42, fled his Brentwood home on April 21st, leaving behind his dead wife Dr. Rachael Maidens, a confessional note on the kitchen counter, a shotgun on the couch, a car trunk stuffed with $87,200 and his young daughter who told responding officers, 'Daddy gone!' A coroner's report indicates that the orthodontist was found on the ground floor of the couple's home and died from multiple gunshot wounds said Lt. John Wood of the Brentwood Police Department. Court Hearing: Randolph Maidens appears in court on Thursday during a preliminary hearing in his trial for murdering his wife, Dr. Rachael Maidens . Police rushed to the plush home after a request by Dr. Maidens mother to check on her daughter after she suspected that Maidens might cause harm to his wife and daughter. The court heard how police could not raise anyone by knocking the door, so entered the property through an unlocked garage door and after announcing they were in the home heard a young child announce, 'I'm here.' The young child told officers that her father was gone and then were presented with the shocking sight of Dr. Maidens body wrapped in a blanket in a hallway close to the living room. A shotgun was rested up against the couch and a note nearby 'expressing regret for what happened' and asking for custody of the child to go to Dr. Maiden's mother. Court Date: Randolph Maidens is charged with shooting his orthodontist wife dead on April 21st with a shotgun in their Tennessee home . Officers also discovered $87,200 in his 2013 Infinit parked inside the home garage, including two Fed Ex envelopes filled with cash in a fireproof safe. While an extensive manhunt could not locate Maidens, he walked back into his home with his hands above his head at around 6 a.m. on April 22nd. Bail was set at $750,000, lowered from its original $2.5 million but District Attorney General Kim Helper argued at the time for the amount to be higher. This was because Maidens got into an altercation with three men during a conference he attended in Orlando, Florida earlier in the year - before he became unemployed. Witnesses who heard the argument allege that Maidens made statements in which he admitted wanting to kill his wife. However, Maidens' attorney, David Raybin, said that his client showed no intention of fleeing as his passport was in his desk drawer and pointed to the fact he surrendered himself freely. Murdered: Randolph Maidens allegedly killed his wife Rachael Maidens in their gated community home . On the evening of the murder, Brentwood police, helped by a SWAT . Team, a K-9 unit and . helicopters, launched an overnight manhunt for Maidens and put the gated community on lockdown as they searched the area. Maidens eventually walked out of the woods behind the back of his house and was taken into custody without incident at 6 am on Monday, ABC News reported. At the time one neighbor described how she witnessed Maidens acting bizarrely three weeks before the shooting. 'I saw him running through the woods behind our house, and he a had on a black ski . mask and a backpack that looked like a quiver,' the neighbor told WKRN-TV. Arrest: Maidens fled the home after allegedly killing his wife and leaving their daughter, 2, with her body . Scene: He later emerged from trees at the back of their plush home in Brentwood, Tennessee . Together: Police have not revealed a motive and friends and neighbors said the family had seemed happy . 'It was daytime . and he was running through the woods... and down to the ravine, right past our house, and I followed him . and he laid down in the ravine and pulled off the ski mask.' When she asked him what he was doing, 'he made some . kind of statement that made no sense' before adding, 'Well, I was walking my dogs, I got lost', she said. Maidens appeared before a Williamson . County magistrate judge In April and was charged with homicide in the . death of his wife, the Williamson County Sheriff's Department told ABC . News. He has no criminal record but on February 23, he was arrested for driving under the influence and refusing to take a Breathalyzer test, records show. Hunt: Police deployed helicopters and K-9 units to search for Maidens after the body of his wife was found . Ripped apart: Maidens is in jail on $750,000 bond while the couple's daughter is now with relatives . He was released on $1,500 cash bond and will appear in court on May 29 at 9 a.m. for the charge. Rachael Maidens owned an orthodontist practice, RM Orthodontics, in Maryland Farms. 'I think to say just how sorry I am and I'm going to miss coming to the office and seeing her,' former patient Cindy Bayer told News Channel 5. 'She always had a smile and was always friendly. She obviously enjoyed what she did, so it's a shame that her life's work is gone.' Mrs Maidens, who grew up in Brentwood, met her husband while practicing in Atlanta for three years.

There should have been plenty to talk about at socialite Heather Kerzner’s 44th birthday party a few weeks ago. It was held in a swanky London restaurant called Downtown Mayfair, and the guest list was eclectic. Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood and his new young bride Sally rubbed shoulders with Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, and their mother, the Duchess of York. Going public: James Middleton with Donna Air leaving Loulou's nightclub together last week . Even Bill Clinton’s former squeeze, Monica Lewinsky, was spotted doing the rounds. But, according to one guest, there was only one topic of conversation that night: what on earth was Donna Air, 33-year-old Geordie TV presenter, doing on the arm of 26-year-old cake entrepreneur James Middleton, brother of the future Queen? Could Donna, daughter of a Newcastle builder and an HR manager, and with a child from a previous relationship, really have bagged the Duchess of Cambridge’s baby brother? As celebrity pairings go, this surely took the biscuit. Or the cupcake. Could Donna, daughter of a Newcastle builder and an HR manager, and with a child from a previous relationship, really have bagged the Duchess of Cambridge’s baby brother? As one party guest noted, the pair didn’t much look like a natural couple: ‘She is pretty, though extremely thin, and obviously much older and more sophisticated than him. He is good-looking and tanned, but seemed a little dazed.’ As well he might. His friends believe he had no idea that going to a party thrown by extrovert Heather Kerzner, who is estranged from her second husband, 77-year-old hotel magnate Sol, would mean his new relationship with Donna Air, seven years his senior, would emerge blinking into the flash bulbs for all to scrutinise. Clearly, though, James appears to have conquered these early nerves about being seen with Donna in public. On Monday, the couple were pictured on a cosy daytime date in London’s Hyde Park, walking James’s dog and holding hands. Cosy: James Middleton with Donna Air in Hyde Park on Monday . And they were pictured last week outside another London nightclub, Loulou’s in Mayfair, after attending a night out with James’s sister, Pippa, and her stockbroker boyfriend, Nico Jackson. Again, Princess Beatrice and Fergie were also there. They have been dating for a few weeks since meeting in Robin Birley’s private members’ club, 5 Hertford Street in Mayfair, a favourite for well-connected Sloanes. James only likes socialising at parties and private clubs where he won’t be watched by inquisitive members of the public. Aside from Pippa, to whom he is very close, James may be reluctant to introduce Donna to his family. As one of his set put it: ‘James will be the only one of his friends to have been out with a Geordie, with someone who has a child, and who hasn’t been to public school. 'All his friends just date each other and each other’s sisters.’ Enjoying some fresh air: James and Donna put on an affectionate display as they wandered around the park . Another was more blunt: ‘Given that the future monarch is going to spend his or her first weeks in the Middletons’ house, no one can quite imagine the reaction to Donna arriving on the scene.’ Indeed, Donna’s journey from child star of TV show Byker Grove to Highgrove is something none of his set can quite believe. At 26, James Middleton lives rent-free with Pippa in Chelsea in a flat bought by his parents. He works for his parents’ party products website in Berkshire, as well as running his Cake Kit Company, which produces cake-making kits and novelty cakes. (Cake Kit was in the red in its last accounts, but not, according to James, to a worrying degree.) Perhaps his business efforts leave him little time for romance, because, since the Royal Wedding, he has been hard to pin down romantically. A few girlfriends have come and gone, including a pretty Australian called Amy Bradshaw, from whom he split in 2010; an unnamed American interior designer who, like Donna, was a few years older than him and, apparently, broke his heart; and, finally, a Japan-based public-school-educated English model called Emily Steel. Like Donna, all were angular faced, leggy blondes. And, like Donna, some of them were not quite the conventional Sloane types that one might expect — and his mother Carole might desire. Donna’s romantic history is far more colourful than that of her younger beau. She had a long-term relationship with zoo-owning property and gambling millionaire Damian Aspinall, now 52. The heir to John Aspinall, founder of elite casino the Clermont Club, Damian was divorced with two children when they met. He and Donna never married, but have a daughter, Freya, now nine. The couple separated when Freya was four, with friends citing his reluctance to marry again as the reason for the split. The Middletons: Carole, James, Michael and Pippa leaving the Goring Hotel after the Royal wedding in 2011 . Aspinall runs Aspers, the casino chain, but his real love seems to be the gorillas who live in his family zoo, Howletts. Donna attracted controversy when she planned to let Freya, then a small baby, be handed into the gorilla cage at Howletts to be passed around by the dominant female, as her half-siblings had been. After the split, Donna moved on to a succession of older, richer men. There was John Dorrance IV, the American London-based heir to the Campbell’s soup fortune, whose wife had gone off with David Beckham’s best friend, Dave Gardner. Donna said their relationship was ‘very serious’, but it didn’t last. After a brief flirtation with George Best’s son Callum, there was Sam Goldstone, a Cheshire-born millionaire who was accused of taking part in a giant VAT-dodging scam involving the sale of mobile phones. (The case against him was eventually thrown out.) As recently as November last year, Donna seemed happy on holiday with Goldstone, rubbing sun cream into his back in Barbados. But at the end of the year they split. James Middleton might not be Donna’s usual established multi-millionaire type, but he certainly has glamorous royal connections and the energy of youth. Last year saw a few unfortunate headlines for Donna. She spent time in a wheelchair after a car crash damaged her ankle, and was then prosecuted for fraud when she was found to have two simultaneous parking permits for two different boroughs. She was later cleared. Things perked up when her career portfolio was boosted with the launch of her children’s clothing range at Debenhams and an appearance in Tom Daley’s ITV diving show, Splash!, in January. February was notable only for her opening a new branch of the discount fashion store TK Maxx in Newcastle. Her website declares that she is a brand ambassador for companies like Next, Westfield and Cadbury’s and has edited organic cookbooks. Hers is a truly contemporary career path. Donna has already offered us many thoughts on her idea of romance. For a while she wrote a dating blog called Donna’s Diary on a matchmaking website called eHarmony. Her advice included the following: you shouldn’t ‘reveal your killer dress until date number three at least’; the perfect date look is trousers, as you feel more in control; and that ‘a spray tan, a Wonderbra, a vodka and tonic, and high heels’ are the best ways to beat tiredness before a date. She also asked pertinent questions such as: ‘How do you duck someone’s tongue lunging towards you without being a total b***h?’ Just as Donna isn’t James’s only older woman, he isn’t Donna’s only toyboy either. Social circles: James Middleton pictured in between mother Carole and sister Pippa at the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding . One online diary entry was entitled ‘Dating with an age gap’, and was an account of a night she spent with a 23-year-old male model ‘who clearly just want[ed] to get laid’. They went to Mahiki, the nightclub haunt of the young royals. Somehow, she avoided telling the model that she lived with her young daughter. She added: ‘But for the record, yes we did have a bit of a snog. Sorry, I couldn’t resist!’ She also expounded further on her ideas of love when she presented a TV programme that would surely turn Carole Middleton’s hair grey, entitled Fifty Ways To Tease Your Lover. Her number one tip was to do a striptease. Dressing up as Star Wars’ Princess Leia also featured highly in her advice. Thankfully, James Middleton is no prude. Some of his novelty cakes feature captions such as ‘jiggly jugs’ and ‘yummy bums’, and many photographs still circulate on the internet of him semi-naked with his boxer shorts pulled down. And while at first glance Donna and James might seem stratospheres apart, their sets do overlap. She has many well-connected friends from her days on TV, and her relationship with Damian Aspinall saw her life evolve from Noel Gallagher’s Primrose Hill gang to Chelsea/Holland Park grandeur — a scene James is thoroughly comfortable in. His friends include society magician Drummond Money-Coutts, Old Harrovian Antonio del Balzo and PR girl Katie Readman. Both he and Donna know Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie well, and hop from charity event to PR openings on the social circuit. Although Damian Aspinall is believed — despite the fact they never married — to have provided for Donna to some degree, she can justifiably consider herself a self-made girl who planted herself in the middle of high society through sheer determination. In which case, should the relationship spark into full flame against James’s friends’ expectations, Carole might find she has more in common with Donna than she might think.","They made their first public appearance as a couple last week after enjoying a secret three-month romance .

It’s a thought that licence-fee payers might echo after the BBC spent a reported £75,000 to hire his services – and several teepees – for a ‘festival-style’ event to boost staff morale. At a time when BBC budgets are being squeezed, some of the 300 employees invited to spend a day in the sunshine described it as ‘pointless’ and an ‘utter waste’ of money.

A spokesman said: ‘A marquee was the most cost-effective option because there are no internal meeting areas of sufficient size.

Worryingly for a man who controls a rogue state and regularly threatens nuclear war with America, North Korean dictator Kim Jung Un is 'socially awkward' and struggles to make eye contact when meeting anyone new. That is the verdict of the documentary crew who traveled with eccentric sports legend Dennis Rodman to the secretive communist nation in late February where he infamously declared himself a 'friend for life' to the 29-year-old despot as they bonded during a basketball game. Indeed, the surreal trip was more bizarre than anyone could have first imagined - as details emerged of Rodman serenading Kim with Frank Sinatra's 'My Way' at a dinner reception to mark the game but not before they had heard a female North Korean pop band play the theme song to 'Rocky' on electric violins. Scroll Down for Video . Former NBA star Dennis Rodman speaks to the media at the Pyongyang Airport before he leaves North Korea Friday, March 1, 2013 - VICE Media's Ryan Duffy is visible to the right . The brainchild of Brooklyn based media company VICE, the trip was ostensibly to follow the Harlem Globetrotters to the reclusive and repressive nation as they staged an exhibition basketball game. Incredibly, the crew had no idea it would meet the reclusive country's young leader, Kim Jong Un, until he showed up at a basketball game it was filming with Rodman - which led to the unlikely bromance between the pair. The crew from VICE discovered that Kim Jung Un loves basketball so much that he overlooked his government's antipathy for VICE founder Shane Smith, who had made two critical documentaries on North Korea, and personally invited the crew in. Smith wasn't allowed back but VICE's Ryan Duffy accompanied Rodman and three members of the Harlem Globetrotters traveling basketball troupe. Asked yesterday about the meeting that forms the center point of their documentary, Duffy said that Kim Jung Un was 'socially awkward' - but not as weird as Rodman who does not once speak to the camera - even though VICE organized the entire trip. Instead, he is only seen as a distant figure, wearing dark sunglasses and a baseball cap. Friends Forever: North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un hugging former NBA player Dennis Rodman following the basketball game between the Harlem Globetrotters team and North Korean University of Physical Education players . This undated publicity image released by HBO shows former NBA basketball player Dennis Rodman, with North Korea's Kim Jong Un (left and right) at a basketball game from an episode of the documentary series 'Vice' Harlem Globetrotters players and North Korean University of Physical Education players belonging to the Hwaebul basketball team at the Ryugyong Jong Ju Yong Gymnasium in Pyongyang, North Korea on February 28th this year . Tourist: Former NBA star Dennis Rodman (C) visits the Arch of Triumph in Pyongyang in this picture released by North Korea's KCNA news agency on March 1, 2013 . Duffy quickly learned his place: One of the first things one of his 'tour guides' told him was, 'I know who you are. I don't like you and I don't like your company,' he said Wednesday. to the New York Daily News. The crew was told when it could turn on its cameras and when they had to be off, and feared landing in a North Korean prison if it didn't comply, he said. The crew went through an elaborate week-long organized tour of North Korea's capital of Pyongyang, visiting a well-stocked mall with no other customers and the country's version of Sea World. At one point, it was shown a classroom with students sitting behind computers, but only one person either knew how or was allowed to use one of the machines. One student sat before Google's home page and never searched for anything, just moving the cursor back and forth randomly. To see more footage from Dennis Rodman's visit click here .

Busy Working: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un presides over an urgent operation meeting on the Korean People's Army Strategic Rocket Force's performance of duty for firepower strike at the Supreme Command in Pyongyang in March . The tour was taken in the hopes of catching one or two glimpses of the real North Korean people, which the group finally achieved toward the end when its minders let the bus stop at a park and the Globetrotters played around with some of the kids, helping them learn to spin a basketball on their finger. Duffy said the group was surprised when Kim arrived to watch what was essentially a pickup basketball game with the Globetrotters and some members of a North Korean youth team. Rodman didn't play; he sat in the stands watching with Kim. After the game, the VICE crew and players were rushed across Pyongyang unexpectedly for a dinner with Kim and other members of the North Korean government. Rodman was only in the country for two days for the Vice show but he and Kim Jung Un got on so well that Rodman was able to reveal stunning snippets of the dictator's life. He said to journalists after he returned that Kim Jung Un- the ruler that Rodman called a 'kid'- has a young baby girl and that he heard Kim's wife talk all about her at length during his trip to the exiled regime. Icon: Dennis Rodman in his heyday at the Chicago Bulls is broadcast to the throng of grey clothed North Korean supporters in Pyongyang before the exhibition match featuring the Harlem Globe Trotters . The 51-year-old athlete also told how the North Korean leader likes 80s disco music, is humble and normally wears normal clothes when not appearing for cameras. Host and executive producer Shane Smith attends the ""Vice"" New York Premiere at Time Warner Center on April 2, 2013 in New York City . The description that Rodman is touting comes in direct contrast to the widespread understanding of the dictatorial leader and the military rogue state that constantly threatens nuclear war. 'It was insane, they treat him like a god. But Kim is not one of these Saddam Hussein-type characters that wants to take over the world,' Rodman told The Sun. 'His grandad built all this s**t and then his dad built some more s**t but he is a normal guy,' Rodman told The Sun. Rodman revealed other details about the lavish trip, including the contents of the 15-course banquet (fish, noodles, and meat), the décor of the palace (‘marble everywhere’) and the height of Kim’s wife, Comrade Ri Sol-ju (5’5” which is ‘quite tall for a Korean’). The trip was apparently a major success, and Rodman has already accepted a second invitation to visit Kim again for six days in August. Although Rodman was key to securing the visit and played the most prominent role of any of the visiting Americans, he's only a bit player in VICE's documentary. Smith said Rodman declined to be interviewed about the trip by VICE afterward. The American group brought in some basketballs and basketball equipment to distribute to young North Koreans, but wasn't asked for anything else by its hosts, Smith said. VICE hasn't spoken to anyone in the Obama administration about the trip, he said. During the trip, the administration had refrained from commenting about it. HBO and VICE have not agreed to continue its series of news documentaries beyond this season, but the arrangement is likely. HBO said the show gets solid ratings, while VICE said the network gives VICE valuable exposure beyond the young audience that traditionally follows its product.","The documentary crew that accompanied Dennis .

A woman who bought a can of green beans on sale for 69 cents got way more than she paid for when she opened it to find a whole toad. But if you ask her, she’ll specify that it was missing its leg (they were mixed in with the beans). Gloria Chubb of St. Joseph County, Indiana didn’t notice the critter as she opened the can of Meijer beans and microwaved them for her family’s dinner of meatloaf, mashed potatoes, and gravy. But when her son scooped some onto his plate, he noticed it had something extra. Disgusting: Indiana woman Gloria Chubb opened a can of green beens and found a toad . ‘I thought maybe it was a piece of moldy bacon or something,’ Chubb told WBND. ‘Because they have bacon in them sometimes. ‘And I took it out of there and it wasn't moldy bacon. It was a toad with parts of his little legs all in the green beans, other than that he was fully intact.’ Chubb couldn’t believe her eyes. ‘I was sick, nauseated for two days,’ said Chubb. Chubb took her purchase back to the . store where she’d purchased them, Meijer. They gave her a full refund . for the can with the toad and all the other cans she’d purchased along . with it. She also took the can in question, and its slimy contents, to the St. Joseph County Health Department. There, food service director Rita Hooten sent her to the Indiana State Department of Health. Appalled: 'Nauseated for two days,' is how Gloria Chubb, right, described her reaction to a toad, left, she found in a 69 cent can of green beans . Their conclusion? The toad was, . indeed, packed in the can along with the beans. Canned food processing, . Chubb learned, is so fast paced the toad was likely totally overlooked. ‘When . the green beans were picked from the field, it was also placed on a . conveyor line and just was accidentally put into the can of green beans . during process,’ said Hooten.

Standing atop his column in Trafalgar Square, Nelson may soon be forced to stare down at a reminder of the nation he defeated - in the form of a giant electric blue cockerel. The 15ft-tall fibreglass bird, designed by German artist Katharina Fritsch, is due to be placed on the fourth plinth on July 20. But a conservation group, headed by a senior judge, has opposed the planned installation, saying it is 'totally inappropriate' for the site in central London. The cock is the national symbol of France - and the Thorney Island Society claims the artwork is unsuitable, given Nelson defeated the French navy at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. This 15ft-tall fibreglass bird, designed by German artist Katharina Fritsch, is due to be placed on the fourth plinth on July 20 . Conservation group the Thorney Island Society has opposed the planned installation, saying it is 'totally inappropriate' for the site in central London. The cock is the national symbol of France - and Nelson defeated the French navy at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 . In a letter to Westminster City Council, the society's chairman Jane Stubbs, wrote: 'We cannot see any logical reason for the proposed sculpture to be placed on the fourth plinth. 'It is unrelated to the context of Trafalgar Square and adds nothing to it but a feeble distraction.' The letter from the group, which has Lord Justice of Appeal Sir Nicholas Underhill as its president, continued that the artist's claim that the 'cockerel is a symbol for regeneration, awakening and strength' was weak. Nor were the campaigners impressed with Fritsch's boast that the giant bird should be viewed as 'a rude interruption to the grey formal architecture of the square', according to the Independent. The society - whose patrons include musician Jools Holland and Labour politician Lord Hattersley, and counts Conservative MP Alan Duncan as vice president - has just days to convince the council, which has recommended the plans be approved by next Tuesday. And this is how it could soon look... Katharina Fritsch told Westminster City Council her artwork (pictured here using an artist's impression) provoked mischief by being put in a square that celebrates victory over the French . Speaking on the controversy surrounding the sculpture, entitled Hahn/Cock, councillor Robert Davis, deputy leader of Westminster City Council, told the Evening Standard: 'I’m sure if this gets planning permission, it will cause quite a stir, particularly because it will be placed under the gaze of Admiral Lord Nelson. 'However, I do wonder what Nelson’s reaction would have been after returning home from battle only to be greeted by the French emblem standing proudly in the centre of London.' In her defence, Fritsch told the council that her artwork provoked mischief by being put in a square that celebrates victory over the French - and would act as a 'species interloper' at a place famed for attracting pigeons. In a sign that the council is likely to approve the installation, it said any perceived harm to the conservation area would be 'offset by the public interest' in the public art. A member of the Fourth Plinth Commissioning Group, Matthew Slotover, said: 'If you want a sculpture that looks like something that was made over 500 years ago, it's not going to be an interesting sculpture.' Alison Lapper, by Marc Quinn . The fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square was originally intended for an equestrian statue but has remained unfilled for 150 years. But since 1998, it has been used to showcase a rotating collection of artworks... ... but wouldn't Maggie be a more fitting choice? A statue of Margaret Thatcher could be erected in Trafalgar Square under plans being considered by ministers. Downing . Street gave the idea of a permanent memorial to the former Prime .

Kadian Harding was hit by a van after he could not stop his bike hours after having his brakes checked . A teenage cyclist who was killed in a road accident had taken his bicycle to a repair shop hours before he died because he was worried about the brakes, an inquest heard yesterday. Kadian Harding, 14, suffered fatal injuries when he crashed with a Mercedes van in July last year during a family bike ride to visit a relative. Kadian was riding down a steep path with five other people, including his father and aunt, when he was unable to stop as he approached the busy road. Eyewitnesses described hearing Kadian . screaming as the bike went down the path at a speed of between 25mph and . 30mph as he desperately tried to slow the bike down before colliding . with the van. The schoolboy suffered catastrophic head injuries and died at the scene. The inquest in Salisbury heard that the . group only ended up on the A4 at Clatford, near Marlborough, Wiltshire, . where Kadian was hit, because they had taken a wrong turn. Thomas . Harding, Kadian's father, told the hearing how his son had saved up the . money to buy the long haul trucker touring bicycle to assemble himself. 'We . were always clear with him that the bike would have to be checked by a . professional bike mechanic before it was deemed road worthy,' Mr Harding . said. 'It was always his intention to get it checked.' Mr Harding, a writer, said Kadian had taken the bicycle to one bike shop close to his home in the village of Steep, near Petersfield, Hampshire, on at least two occasions during July and to the Acceler8 shop in Marlborough on the day he died. Mr Harding, who is a cousin of former editor of The Times newspaper James Harding, told the inquest that in his view, having ridden the bike two days before his son died, the brakes were 'functioning' but not 'optimal'. On the morning of the day Kadian died, he said he told his son to get the bicycle checked by a professional. 'I specifically said: ""We are really concerned about the brakes. You must get the front and back brakes looked at.""' He was hit during a family bike ride and father Thomas said he was laughing and joking moments earlier . Mr Harding said Kadian took the bike to a shop. 'He said they looked over all the brakes and replaced a cable. I didn't have a go (on the bike) but I did try both front and back brakes. 'I noticed they were much firmer now. I noticed the pads were now about 1mm apart.' Mr Harding, an experienced cyclist, said that the day before his son died, in his opinion, there was 'no danger of a catastrophic failure'. 'From my narrative he would not have had the problems he had on the Wednesday if he had not gone to the bike shop,' he said. Describing the moments before the fatal crash, Mr Harding said: 'I was right behind Kadian. We were talking and he was laughing and making jokes. 'We weren't going that fast. We were cycling in tandem and then he was suddenly ahead of me. 'It made no sense that Kadian wouldn't stop because you could see the road and there was plenty of time to stop.' Witness Richard Knowles, who lives close to the crash scene, said he heard Kadian screaming as he cycled down the path. 'From the moment he came out of the tree line to the moment he passed me was only a few seconds,' he said. Inquest heard that Kadian had saved up to buy the self-assembled bike but his father insisted it be checked first to make sure that it was road worthy . 'He was pumping the brakes and that made me realise he was in trouble. 'He was standing up on the pedals. He was applying so much force to his brakes that he was trying to keep the bike stable. 'I . think I said to him words to the effect of ""come off"". He made no . attempt to steer off the path. He made no attempt to come off the pedals . and put his feet on the floor.' Philip . Birkett, owner of Acceler8, said Kadian had come into the shop and . asked him to look at the gears and the rear brakes but said the teenager . had not mentioned anything about the brakes in general. 'If that had been mentioned I would have suggested that the bike stay for longer,' he said. Mr Birkett said he adjusted the gears because they were 'ticking' and replaced a frayed rear brake cable and re-set them. 'I stand by my work and everything I did was correct. When that bike left the shop it was in a perfectly safe condition,' he said. Under cross-examination by Jeremy Hyam, representing the Harding family, Mr Birkett said he did not hold any qualifications for repairing bicycles. 'I have never felt the need to do so. I feel comfortable with my abilities.' Mr Birkett denied the suggestion that he had adjusted both the front and rear brakes. The hearing was adjourned until today.","Kadian Harding was hit by a van after careering into busy road .

A British grandmother who has been sentenced to death in Bali for drug smuggling says the British Government has let her down. Lindsay Sandiford is due to be executed by a firing squad after an Indonesian court convicted her of taking £1.6million of cocaine into the country in May last year. The 56-year-old is planning to appeal against her draconian sentence, but has failed in a bid to force the UK Government to fund her legal case. Speaking to Victoria Derbyshire on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sandiford said the Government's refusal to pay for her lawyers was 'tantamount to condoning the death penalty'. The talk-show host sent 14 questions Ms Sandiford, originally from Redcar, Teesside, via charity Reprieve, and she chose to answer two of them. When asked if she thought the British Government was doing enough to help her case, she said: 'The Government has done very little to support me. The FCO has done even less. 'However, I have been able to talk about my situation and will continue to do so because there are others in a similar desperate plight that are not seen. 'There are, and will continue to be, British nationals facing execution without lawyers, and because they can not raise their voices the Government is standing by refusing to assist with funding of lawyers for them.

One of the most notorious sex scandals in British history has taken a mysterious new turn after a chance discovery. A portrait of a young woman involved in the Profumo affair has been found on the back of a drawing of Christine Keeler, whose affair with a married Cabinet minister shook the Establishment in the 1960s. The woman apparently witnessed the moment the model first met John Profumo at a debauched party - but her identity is completely unknown and curators are now appealing for help in discovering who she was. Some have pointed out that the picture is almost identical to another key player in the scandal - but unfortunately, no one knows her name. Do you know the mystery woman? Call 0203 615 1833 or email hugo.gye@dailymail.co.uk . Discovery: A drawing of a mystery woman, left, was found on the back of a portrait of Christine Keeler, and could be a woman known as 'Miss X' who was connected to the Profumo affair . Chance find: The drawing was on the reverse of this picture depicting the model Ms Keeler, right . The discovery of the pastel sketch was made by a curator at the National Portrait Gallery, where an exhibition marking the 50th anniversary of the scandal has just gone on display. Clare Freestone noticed that a drawing of Ms Keeler by scandal-ridden doctor Stephen Ward had a note attached to it by its subject. The note, from March 1975, read: 'This is me, but I don't know who the girl on the back is - she is somebody we just picked up at a bus-stop.' When they turned over the paper, they saw a beguiling portrait of a young woman with a fashionable haircut looking off to her right. Scandal: John Profumo was forced to resign from the Cabinet after it emerged he was sleeping with Ms Keeler . In Ms Keeler's autobiography, Scandal!, she says that Ward had asked her to find girls to attend a party in 1961 at his house on the Cliveden estate, owned by the aristocratic Astor family. 'Driving past London airport we offered a lift to a girl waiting at the bus stop,' she wrote. 'She seemed nice, so we invited her to the party at Stephen's cottage.' That party turned out to be the start of the affair between Profumo, then the Secretary of State for War, and Ms Keeler, a showgirl 27 years his junior. The Tory MP walked in on Ward, Ms Keeler and their unknown new friend in the swimming pool, and chased the model around when she was wearing nothing but a towel. All this must have been witnessed by the woman, who could also have met distinguished guests at the estate such as Ayub Khan, then the president of Pakistan. Ms Keeler's memoir records that the mystery guest was driven back to London after the party. Affair: The picture of Ms Keeler, left, was drawn by notorious osteopath Stephen Ward, right . The Profumo affair was considered . emblematic of the early 1960s, a time when the traditional British way . of life was rapidly being replaced by modern customs. John . Profumo was forced to resign as Secretary of State for War in 1963 . after it emerged that he had lied to Parliament about his relationship . with model and showgirl Christine Keeler. The Conservative minister was 27 years older than his lover, and was married to actress Valerie Hobson. The . scandal was even believed to endanger national security when it was . revealed that Ms Keeler was also having an affair with Soviet spy . Yevgeny Ivanov, as well as notorious drug dealer Johnny Edgecombe. When . Harold Macmillan resigned as Prime Minister later that year, his . decision was widely thought to be linked to the fall-out from the . affair. Profumo, who died in 2006, devoted the rest of his life to rehabilitating his reputation through charity work. The National Portrait Gallery is keen to discover the woman's identity to fit another piece into the puzzle of the Profumo affair. 'We would love to know who she is,' curator Terence Pepper told the Guardian. 'Or if one of her friends knows who she is, or her grandchildren. It is a real mystery and that's why we need some help.' Ms Keeler, 71, one of the few actors in the scandal who is still alive, has not commented on the mystery. Her friend Leon Norell, who was at the Cliveden party, told The Times: 'I vaguely remember giving a lift to somebody. She must be about 70 now.' He added that he thought her name might be Ursula. One intriguing possibility is that she could be a woman known as 'Miss X' who testified against Ward at his trial for living off the proceeds of prostitution. The witness, who bears a striking similarity to the portrait, told a court in 1963 that the osteopath had seduced him and added that he had a two-way mirror as his bedroom door. Ward's trial came in the wake of Profumo's affair with Ms Keeler, which led to the minister's resignation and helped to bring down Harold Macmillan's government in 1963. The relationship was considered particularly scandalous because the model was simultaneously sleeping with Yevgeny Ivanov, a Soviet spy attached to the Russian embassy.

There was further chaos in the UKIP ranks last night as the father of a rising Tory star tried to withdraw his candidacy for the party just 90 minutes after it was announced. Securing the support of Sushil Patel was a coup for the Eurosceptic party as a British Asian, and the father of the Conservative MP for Witham and leading right-winger Priti Patel, 41. But shortly after yesterday’s announcement by Nigel Farage around 2.30pm that he was their candidate in the Bushey South ward of Hertfordshire County Council, Mr Patel told a journalist around 4pm that he had stood down. Priti Patel said she still 'loves' her father after he was chosen as UKIP candidate in the council elections . Minutes later, UKIP, released a statement saying Mr Patel was still standing and unable to give interviews as he is ‘currently convalescing from a recent serious operation’. They quoted Mr Patel saying: ‘I am proud of being a UKIP candidate and very proud of the achievements of my daughter who represents the people of Witham in an exemplary fashion. ‘My views are my own and I am astonished that there has been quite so much interest in my candidacy.’ It is understood he was unable to withdraw since his name is already on the ballot paper. Sources claimed he had a ‘wobble’ after Conservative central office were alerted to his candidacy. He and his wife were Ugandan Asian refugees who came to Britain in the 1970s, and ran a post office in rural Norfolk before settling in West London, where they ran a small shop. Mr Patel, 64, said last night: ‘Ukip is not a racist party – it is daylight coming through the darkness hours of this country... I joined a year ago because I had been watching it. Ukip is not racist – they are trying to make progress. Sushil Patel tried to withdraw his candidacy just 90 minutes after being announced by UKIP party leader Nigel Farage . ‘If you look at how many communities have settled here – they made their home. If it was genuinely racist it would be chaos by now. I am an example of it, not just me but all the East African Asians, Uganda, Kenya, South Africa, from Rhodesia. ‘The eye opener came after 2004 when the British jobs for British people were going away – we expect our jobs for our people. The British people are intelligent, this is a warm country, the only country in the world which is not racist’. He said he had not told his daughter about his plans to stand. She attended a local comprehensive school and studied economics at Keele University before going on to work for Andrew Lansley, then head of the Conservative Research Department. Also a well-known Eurosceptic, she headed the press office for the Referendum Party from 1995-7. The party set up by Sir James Goldsmith called for a referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union and polled some 800,000 votes in 1997. She re-joined the Conservative party in 1997 after they promised they would only join the single European currency if there was a referendum. Priti Patel said last night: ‘He’s my dad and I love him.’ Ten years ago, she gave an outspoken interview about ‘racist attitudes’ and ‘bigoted elements’ in the Conservative party after she had interviews with three constituencies and failed to be shortlisted.","Sushil Patel is standing for UKIP in Hertfordshire County Council elections .

A runner has suffered a setback in his training for a charity triathlon after discovering he is allergic to running. Within minutes of returning from intensive training runs, Ben Dixon, 29, finds his eyes swell up so much he can barely see. And as the extreme puffiness takes up to three days to go down, medical physicist Ben is embarrassed to face his colleagues at work because they think he's been in a fight. An eyesore: Ben is ashamed of his face when suffering an uncomfortable flare-up . Ben's wife Maria (right) believes he suffering with urticaria, more commonly known as hives. The allergic reaction, which also causes his whole body to come out in pink bumps, has baffled Ben's GP wife Maria, 30. Ben, who lives in Gateshead, said: ‘It only ever happens when I run really hard, nothing else brings it on. ‘I know it's not hayfever because it happens at all times of year and it's not an allergy to sweat because it never happens with other sports. ‘I've joined Saltwell Harriers running club and the other day I did their three mile club race and really went for it, sprinting at the end. ‘Within ten minutes of finishing I could feel my eyes starting to itch and then they just blew up - I could hardly see. 'I look absolutely ridiculous and it's really embarrassing - I end up trying not to make eye contact with anyone. Ben has tried taking antihistamines, but they make no difference during flare-up. Maria believes Ben's allergic reaction is exercise-induced urticaria, more commonly known as hives. Chris (left) and Ben (centre), pictured here with Ben's wife Maria (right), were the best of friends. Indeed there is a specific type of urticaria called exercise urticaria. Exercise triggers the flare-up because it stimulates the activity of mast cells, a type of . connective tissue cell. When the cells are put under stress, such as when a person is training intensively, they release a substance called histamine. It . is this chemical that triggers the swelling . Ben, who works at James Cook University . Hospital in Middlesbrough, said he has suffered the allergic reaction . about 20 times and it always occurs after pushing himself particularly . hard during a run. He is training for The Outlaw Half Ironman Triathlon in Nottingham in June in memory of his friend Chris Bygate. Chris died tragically aged 30 last October after falling 100ft while walking in the Lake District with his fiance Gar-Ling Ng. The couple, who lived together in Derby, were due to marry this May. Ben is doing a triathlon in memory of his late friend Chris (pictured), who was a keen runner. Gar-Ling, Chris's sister Lorna Smith and a team of 29 friends including Ben have entered the triathlon in a bid to raise £20,000 for the Great North Air Ambulance, whose paramedics were first on scene after Chris's accident and gave him the best chance of survival. The epic challenge is half the distance of a full Ironman Triathlon and involves a 1.2 mile swim, a 56 mile bike ride and a 13.1 mile run. Ben, who met Chris while they were both students at Durham University, said: ""Chris did a full Ironman Triathlon last year and I know he would be laughing his head off at us all doing this. 'He was someone who lived life to the full, not only in terms of his amazing achievements but also in his home life. 'He always had warm words and a huge smile for his friends and family and was such an uplifting and positive person to be around. 'He was totally inspirational and I'm truly privileged to have called him my friend.' Chris, who worked as an engineer for Rolls Royce, died in hospital four days after the accident and saved the lives of two other people by donating his organs after his death.

It can be limited to one part of the body or spread across large areas. It occurs when high levels of histamine are released in the skin. Allergic reaction, extreme hot or cold, infection and some foods can trigger an attack. However, in over 50% of cases, no cause can be found. If it clears completely within six weeks, it is known as acute urticaria. Treatment usually involves taking antihistamines, although in severe cases steroids can be prescribed. Long-term urticaria may require treatment from a dermatologist which involves medication and advice on avoiding triggers.","Ben Dixon, 29, develops painful, swollen eyes when he trains intensively .

The suspected killer had first told his brother that he had a vision of stabbing his girlfriend. The brother then passed this information to psychiatrist Noam Koenigsberg who called 911. The operator he spoke to dealt with it professionally and passed it on to the dispatcher, who is now under investigation.

Train company Arriva has said they have no problem with men wearing skirts, saying the uniforms represent their company, no matter the sex of the person wearing them. ‘Our thinking is that one should look decent and proper when representing Arriva and the present uniforms do that. 'If the man only wants [to wear] a skirt then that is OK,’ Arriva communications manager Tomas Hedenius told local newspaper Mitt I. ‘To tell them to do something else would be discrimination.’ Dress code: Stockholm train drivers are allowed to wear skirts or trousers, whether they are man or woman, as long as they do not go for shorts .

Fired up: The event is celebrated every year to herald good monsoon rains for increased rice harvest, prosperity and good luck . Monsoon weather will bring with it an increased rice harvest, prosperity and good luck. The rain festival is one of the Asian country's major events, and is observed by both the Buddhist and Hindu communities of the country's capital, Kathmandu. During the month-long celebration devotees ask the rain god, Rato Machindranath, for rainfall to prevent drought during the rice harvest season. Burning passion: The festival is observed by both the Buddhist and Hindu communities of Kathmandu . Grand finale: The culmination of the festivities were marked in Bungamati on the outskirts of Nepal's capital Kathmandu .

One day, the farmer had come to watch the chariot pulling festival when he saw someone wearing his missing garment. A quarrel ensued, and it was agreed that the vest would be kept with the chariot until the rightful owner was able to prove it had been theirs. Since then, the vest has been shown to the public annually as a call to potential claimants to step forward.

The Duke: A newly discovered memoir begun by Hollywood icon John Wayne before his death reveals the star never wanted to be an actor . He became one of Hollywood’s biggest stars, but John Wayne once saw acting as just ‘a brief detour’. His real dream was to become a film director. Cinema’s most iconic cowboy could have spent his days behind the camera had he not inadvertently stepped in front of one on a John Ford set, allowing the  director to see his potential. The disclosure is in a memoir he was working on that lay undiscovered among family papers. It said Wayne, who died in 1979, was working at 20th Century Fox in the 1920s simply to pay the bills. It added: ‘I had no thoughts of becoming an actor. Acting was a kind of apprenticeship toward becoming a director. It was also a source of petty cash … . 'I was dead-set on becoming a director. Elsewhere, he adds: 'If need be, I would take a brief detour into acting or whatever else was necessary to accomplish my goal.' The memoir was found by Michael Goldman in researching his book, John Wayne: The Genuine Article, published this month. Even Wayne’s family did not know of its existence in their archives. Its 72 typed pages paint a portrait of an ordinary man who became the Oscar-winning star of True Grit and The Searchers, a larger-than-life icon nicknamed the Duke. Wayne was working on it shortly before his death in 1979, having repeatedly rejected requests for an autobiography. He wrote about the 1920s, when he headed for Twentieth Century Fox’s studio and found menial jobs in props and stunt-work, learning his techniques for horse-riding, roping, guns and fighting. The memory of being desperate for money never left him and in the memoir he writes: 'The big Depression was still two years away, but my one personal depression was staring at me from the bottom of my empty soup bowl. 'I needed a job.' John Wayne as Ethan Edwards in The Searchers, . 1956: The memoir was found by Michael Goldman while researching his . book, John Wayne: The Genuine Article, published this month . He describes working as an extra – kicked off John Ford’s set for inadvertently stepping in front of a camera – and, like some star-struck teenager, was overwhelmed by the excitement of seeing his own movie heroes. On encountering Tom Mix, a silent Western star, Wayne writes of trying 'to figure out how to make the best impression possible on the greatest cowboy star in the world'. He records Mix ignoring him on his attempt to ingratiate himself. Mr Goldman notes the irony of Wayne idolising Mix: 'The man who would become ""the most iconic cinematic cowboy in history"" was racking himself over how to make an impression on ""the most iconic cinematic cowboy in history"".' True grit: Wayne as Rooster Cogburn in the . iconic 1969 Western. He had headed for Hollywood in the Twenties and . found menial jobs in props and stunt-work, learning techniques for . horse-riding, roping, guns and fighting . The biographer says of Wayne's 'brief detour' in front of the camera: 'It was a detour that lasted until his death. 'Wayne would ultimately direct just four films, including The Alamo and The Green Berets, ""passion projects"" for him. But directing was not what he became known for. 'Wayne does not elaborate in the manuscript on why he never made directing a priority in subsequent years. 'It was John Ford who saw Wayne’s star potential. He kept him on his prop crew, began using him as an extra, gave him his first on-camera speaking role and went on to direct him in about a dozen films, including their masterpiece, Stagecoach.' Wayne as John Elder in The Sons Of Katie Elder, 1965: Despite his original ambition, Wayne would ultimately direct just four films, including The Alamo and The Green Berets, ""passion projects"" for him says Mr Goldman . Wayne writes: 'John Ford would teach me everything I know about filmmaking. The feeling I would come to have for scenes and just about anything else would come from standing behind him and watching him work.' But another legendary director, John Huston, was not among his heroes and, in his memoir, he takes aim at him over his direction of Moby Dick: 'I had, for a number of years, blamed Gregory Peck - an otherwise excellent actor - for his bad performance as Ahab in Moby Dick… . 'I had desperately wanted that part and was annoyed with Peck’s portrayal…' 'It was a detour that lasted until his death': The left picture shows Wayne alongside Lana Turner in The Sea Chase, 1955. The right picture is taken from the 1961 movie The Comancheros . Referring to his own unfortunate collaboration with Huston – The Barbarian and the Geisha – he continues: 'Sitting on my horse waiting for the cameras to roll… [I] realized what kind of picture and performance this was going to be. 'Probably worse than Peck’s as Ahab… I finally realized Peck didn’t have a chance. Nor, for that matter, did I.' Goldman’s book – with a foreword by former US president Jimmy Carter and preface by Wayne’s son Ethan - draws on the memoir, along with unpublished letters and interviews with Wayne’s children and wife, Pilar.","Hollywood star saw acting as a 'brief detour' before his directing career .

Several people have been arrested for trying to cash-in on the devastation following the Moore, Okla., tornado that killed 24 and injured hundreds nearly three weeks ago. As thousands of people struggle to put their lives back together, Moore police continue to investigate looters in the disaster area who have stolen appliances, wires and even a $50,000 watch, The Oklahoman reported. Some people came from as far away as New York and Virginia to loot in Moore since the May 20 tornado. Three men told investigators they traveled more than 1,000 miles from Virginia in order to loot the disaster area. Shameful: Virginia residents Steven Corky Daniels, 36, left, and Justin Wagner, 25, right, were arrested for looting in Moore, Okla., along with Steve Costello, 44, of New York, after a tornado destroyed the city . Steven Corky Daniels, 36, was arrested June 2 after a police offer saw him walking with a 'large piece of utility wire in his hand'. Daniels, from Harrisonburg, Va., told police he was in the city just to loot. '[Daniels] advised he drove from Virginia to Moore ... with two other subjects for the purpose of removing steel and copper utility wire from the disaster area,' an affidavit filed in Cleveland County District Court read according to The Oklahoman. He was charged with disturbing a disaster area. Steve Costello, 44, and Justin Wagner, 25, were arrested with Daniels. Both also apparently confessed to police when they were questioned. Police spotted Costello standing next to a truck attached to a trailer that had 'a large amount of steel and copper utility wire' in it, according to the affidavit. Wagner was 'going through disaster debris' before he was arrested, The Oklahoman reported. Cashing in: Police stand beside two men sitting handcuffed on the street whom they have detained on suspicion of looting in Moore the day after the May tornado . Though Daniels and Wagner live some 1,200 miles from Moore, Costello listed his home address in Elmhurst, N.Y.--roughly 1,500 miles from Moore. In addition to outside threats, The Oklahoman reported that some looters can be found a little closer to home. Maria Lopez, from neighboring Norman, Okla., was arrested on May 29 after members of the National Guard and local residents allegedly saw her directing children to look through debris from the tornado. Police reported several stolen items were in the SUV she was driving 'in plain view', according to The Oklahoman. Moore resident Edward Dean McDonald, 45, was arrested May 28 after he was seen 'loading a refrigerator onto a dolly', one police officer wrote in an affidavit, according to The Oklahoman. Police said other appliances, including a washer and dyer, were seen in a nearby trailer when he was questioned. McDonald couldn't prove to police he had permission to take the items. Both Lopez and McDonald were charged with disturbing a disaster area. Looted: Even as homeowners continue to sort through tornado debris in Moore, Okla., some people are trying to cash in on the disaster, looting for wire, refrigerators and other goods . Another Moore resident Osbaldo de Jesus Sagastume-Rodas, 59, was arrested after police saw him loading 'metal, copper wires, tool boxes' into his pickup truck. Though many of those people arrested attempted to steal wire, copper and other industrial materials, Moore residents have also reported expensive items were taken from their homes. One Moore resident has reported more than $70,000 in stolen goods since the May 20 tornado, including a $50,000 Patek Philippe wristwatch and a $13,000 Rolex. Another resident reported $6,000 in stolen items, including a $1,300 hunting camera. After two other looters were arrested the day after the storm, the Oklahoma Insurance Commissioner said they would develop a badge system to deter stealing, according to KWTV. Residents were to be issued badges with their picture on it in order to enter the neighborhoods ravaged by the storm for the next three months.","Three men who traveled over 1,000 miles to loot utility wire, steel and copper from Moore homes arrested .

A woman of 20 has been questioned by police over the murder of a mother of two found with her throat slashed. Jabeen Younis’s body was discovered at her home on Friday by police following a tip-off. It is understood that her six-year-old son may have been with her when she was killed. Friends said Miss Younis, 30, had been planning a new life following the breakdown of her marriage after only five months. She had recently separated from her husband and was hoping to return to her native Pakistan for a fresh start, they said. Last night, as the 20-year-old woman was released on police bail until Thursday, Miss Younis’s home, in Oldham, remained sealed off. Sources said the murder was a ‘domestic’ incident but refused to elaborate. A post-mortem examination revealed Miss Younis died of multiple stab wounds. Miss Younis, who also has a nine-year-old daughter, moved to Oldham from Pakistan around ten years ago. She is divorced from the children’s father and remarried last year but recently ended the ‘turbulent’ relationship. One friend, who did not wish to be named, said he had spoken to Miss Younis, who worked in a furniture store, less than 24 hours before her death. He said: ‘Her marriage was over and she wanted to go back home to get away from it. ‘I’d been on the phone with her helping to arrange it all and she was looking to leave very soon. She was a nice girl who just wanted the best for her children and for them to lose their mum is just unbelievably tragic.’ Nearby residents have described dramatic scenes as police cars raced to the scene after receiving a 'concern for welfare' call . Extra patrols have been stepped up in the area and a team of detectives are working to establish the circumstances leading up to the death . Police have said a murder investigation was underway to establish the full circumstances surrounding her death. Another friend said: ‘Jabeen had problems, I saw her with a black eye not so long ago. A large section of the residential street was cordoned off throughout the day as forensics officers combed the house for clues . ‘She was very strong and wouldn’t put . up with any nonsense. She was westernised, a lovely girl who was always . there for her kids.’ Damian Salt, Miss Younis’s boss, . said: ‘She was very friendly and happy, really bubbly and talkative.

In the run up to the assault, Eljanabi told the victim: 'come with us, you're going to do anything we say and if you try to run away we will catch you.' After the assault, the victim was so frightened of catching a bus home in case the pair followed, he walked almost seven miles to a friend's house to confide about his ordeal. Police were called after the boy's mother found out about the incident. The boy, now 15, has been left 'absolutely devastated' by his ordeal. He took a drink and drugs overdose . two months after the rape, and now has difficulty sleeping and suffers . panic attacks if he goes into public toilets. Eljanabi and Wilson Fletcher ,who worked . as a finance officer for a Liverpool law firm, were trapped after police . issued CCTV of the rapists as part of a nationwide public appeal for . help. At Manchester . Crown Court today, El-Janabi, of Longsight and Wilson-Fletcher, of Ardwick, were found guilty of rape and sexual assault by unanimous verdicts following a trial last month. Horrific: The pair abducted their 14-year-old victim in Manchester's Arndale Centre on a busy Saturday afternoon and marched him to this Debenhams store where they carried out the attack . Passing sentence Judge Michael Leeming told them: 'There's no indication of any remorse, empathy or insight from you. 'This . attack will stay with this boy for a long time. He took an overdose of . pills and alcohol describing it as a cry for help because he didn't have . anyone to speak to. 'He's . depressed and has difficulty sleeping. He experiences panic attacks in . public toilets. He received counselling and expects to do so for a long . time.' It emerged El-Janabi had . been seen 'hanging around' the third floor toilets at the four storey . Debenhams store on numerous occasions by staff, and had on one occasion . been escorted off the premises. Wilson-Fletcher handed himself in after . seeing his photo on a BBC wanted website and was picked out at an ID . parade due to his distinctive lazy eye. The assault began in the early evening of June 2 last year after the boy went to a gentleman's toilet at Manchester Arndale Centre after leaving a youth club. Convicted: Abdelkader El-Janabi is pictured at Manchester Magistrates Court. He was jailed today for 15 years . As he stood at the urinals, Eljanabi and Wilson-Fletcher began staring at him. Giving evidence by video link the lad said: 'I left the youth group at 5.45pm. 'I was walking near the Arndale and I needed the toilet. When I went in, some Asian person stood next to me and started staring at me, looking at me up and down.' The boy said he felt so 'anxious' and nervous' he moved along one urinal for more privacy - but Wilson-Fletcher had already entered the toilets and started eyeing him up on his other side. The lad added: 'The Asian person grabbed my arm and said, ""come with us, you're going to do anything we say and if you try to run away we will catch you."" The boy said a cleaner and some other shoppers were present in the toilets, whilst he was threatened and said: 'I started panicking. He mumbled it to me - he said it to me so no-one else could here"", he added. The boy said he made a dash for it, but Eljanabi caught up with him, motioning the boy in the direction of the Debenhams Store with his paper - with Wilson-Fletcher following closely behind. 'He tapped me with the paper. The white person was behind - if I had ran the opposite way, the white man would have been there"", he said. Once inside the store, the youngster was directed into the lift, they took up to the toilets. The two men then abused the boy before Eljanabi raped him as Wilson-Fletcher looked on. Eljanabi became a suspect after his flat caretaker alerted police after seeing CCTV photograph of him in a public appeal about the attack. Police swooped and arrested him at his flat in August 2012 and officers found pornographic DVDs of boys in school uniforms. He was matched to the man in the CCTV footage by facial-mapping experts. Eljanabi who settled in the UK in 2002 later told police: 'I had nothing to do with this attack. I was not there. I was elsewhere. I didn't know the complainant. I have no involvement in this whatsoever.' The court heard he had served in the Iraqi army as a military intelligence officer and fought in the Iran-Iraq war in 1980 and the Gulf War of the early 90s. He claimed he had been captured and tortured by American soldiers which left him with long standing knee injuries and said he was bed ridden at the time of the sexual assault. Wilson-Fletcher said he had 'no recollection what happened that day', but denied any involvement in an attack. After the case Supt Stuart Ellison, of Greater Manchester Police said: 'This crime quite rightly shocked the city centre community as this vulnerable victim was marched across a busy part of the city during a Saturday afternoon. 'That a young boy could be preyed on while all around him shoppers go about their business was doubly shocking. 'Quite rightly everyone felt a sense of shock and disgust when we publicised this case and we still share those feelings.""","Abdelkader .

The head of the company promoting Michael Jackson's ill-fated comeback concerts told jurors that he never consulted a mental health professional to help the singer despite two high-level show workers suggesting it was necessary. AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips testified on Thursday about emails he sent and received in the week before Jackson's death, including a production manager's characterization that the entertainer's condition was 'deteriorating.' Phillips is testifying in a negligent hiring case filed by Jackson's mother against AEG Live LLC, claiming the company failed to properly investigate the doctor convicted of giving her son a lethal dose of an anesthetic. Her lawyers also contend that Phillips and AEG Live executives ignored signs of Jackson's poor health and pushed the entertainer to perform. Scroll down for video... Michael Jackson's tour manager said the singer shuold see a mental health expert before his London comeback tour . Emails displayed to jurors hearing the . case show that Phillips told Jackson's business manager he believed the . singer might have breached his contract by missing rehearsals. The . email was sent June 20, 2009, five days before the 'Thriller' singer . died from an overdose of propofol. 'And I thought it couldn't get worse,' the business manager, Michael Kane, responded. Phillips said Kane had . been seeking a $1 million advance for Jackson against the earnings of . his 'This Is It' shows. Phillips' email to Kane came hours . after the tour director, Kenny Ortega, and production manager, John . Hougdahl, emailed Phillips telling them that Jackson was in such a poor . emotional state that he couldn't rehearse that night and had to be sent . home. 'I have watched him deteriorate in . front of my eyes over the last 8 weeks,' Hougdahl wrote. 'He was able to . do multiple 360 spins back in April. He'd fall on his ass if he tried . it now.' According to Hougdahl, Jackson said . earlier that night after watching a pyrotechnics demonstration, 'You . aren't going to kill the artist, are you?' In a later email, Hougdahl told . Phillips he believed Jackson needed a mental examination. 'My layman's . degree tells me he needs a shrink to get him mentally prepared to get . him prepared to get on stage,' he wrote. Ortega also wrote to Phillips hours later, urging that Jackson get some psychological help. Lawsuit: The email was disclosed at the trial in the wrongful-death suit filed against AEG by Jackson's mother and his children . Earlier that night, Jackson had been 'trembling, rambling and obsessive,' according to Ortega, who wrote to . Phillips that the singer seemed unable to rehearse due to 'real . emotional stuff.' Phillips has yet to testify about a meeting he had with Jackson's doctor, Conrad Murray. Jackson died before signing Murray's . $150,000-a-month contract to accompany him for 50 shows planned at . London's O2 Arena. AEG denies it hired Murray, and several of its . executives have testified that the former physician's fee would have . been deducted from Jackson's earnings for the 'This Is It' shows. Phillips is the highest-ranking AEG . Live executive to testify in the trial, which has concluded its sixth . week. He denied Thursday that he ever threatened Jackson over missed . rehearsals. 'We would have never dealt with Michael that way,' he said. He also rejected the idea that he was responsible for Jackson's health. 'I'm not responsible for his medical needs,' Phillips said.

An allegedly violent man who created a fake dating website profile to convince his ex-wife to skip a court appearance for a protection order against him has been charged with stalking. Using a fake name and stolen pictures, Brian Matthew Cornelius lured his former wife into an intimate digital relationship during which she shared intimate details about her ex-husband for more than a year. But when the 36-year-old man started showing up to the same places as his ex-wife, the Minnesota woman put the pieces together. Stalker: Be careful who you talk to online . According to charges filed Tuesday in Dakota County District Court, Cornelius, from Sturgeon Lake in Minnesota, exchanged emails, texts and other electronic communications with his ex under the pseudonym 'Aaron Carpenter' about three months after their divorce. The pair were married from 2000 to 2011 and have two young children. Throughout the 'extensive' online union, the West St. Paul woman 'confided intimate details of her life and daily activities' and her concerns about her ex-husband, the Mercury News reports.

Then in March last year, the woman told 'Carpenter' about her plans to get a protection order against her ex after he allegedly physically assaulted her. He persuaded her to drop the court appearance - the order request was dismissed. About five months later, the manipulated woman discovered Cornelius' trickery after he started showing up at places she told 'Carpenter' she would be.

"By . Daniel Bates . PUBLISHED: . 23:52 EST, 8 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 23:52 EST, 8 June 2013 . The name you choose for your baby gives away your political affiliation, new research has revealed. Conservatives tend to choose more masculine-sounding names for their children with lots of K’s and B’s.They are also fond of choosing names with lots of D’s and T’s because they sound tough. The study showed that people with more left wing views do the opposite and tend to include a lot of feminine words. These include L sounds and soft-A endings such as Sophia. The findings may give a clue into why President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle, landed on Sasha and Malia for their kids names. Left wing: First daughters Sasha and Malia were given names by their parents that reflect the family's liberal orientation . On the other end of the spectrum are Sarah Palin's children. The former Republican governor of Alaska gave most of her children hard-sounding names like Track, Trig, Bristol and Piper (Willow being the exception). The US researchers looked at birth records from 545,018 babies born in California in 2004, representing 52,589 different names. They then compared the names to voting returns in each neighborhood and used these as an indication of their parents’ political inclination. The study found that ‘soft’ sounds, like the L in ‘Lola’, the A in ‘Ella’ or the Y in ‘Carly’ were more likely to be found in areas which voted on the left. Examples of this include ‘Julian’ or ‘Liam’ for a boy or a girl’s name like ‘Naomi’ - the name of one of Vice President Joe Biden's daughters. Conservatives by contrast went for ‘harder’ sounds such as Tagg, Craig, Ben and Matt, names chosen by the family of former Presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Romney & Sons: Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney speaks at an event flanked by his sons, most of whom have conservatively-typical hard-sounding names . The Palin brood: The only Palins pictured here without hard-sounding conservatives names are Willow, center, and Sarah herself . Lead researcher Eric Oliver, a political scientist at the University of Chicago, said that the difference could be to do with perceptions of names that are linked to wealth. Traditionally masculinity has been linked to economic success, so by giving your child a more masculine name parents could in theory be hoping they will become wealthy too. Professor Oliver said: ‘The fact that we would find any kind of systematic differences, much less the magnitude of differences that we found - I really did not anticipate that. ‘I think most of this happens unconsciously...underneath there is a lot of signalling going on’. Another finding related to the kind of names that parents chose. Liberal parents are more likely to choose an obscure name to denote status whilst conservatives usually opt for something more conventional, the study showed. Left-wing mothers and fathers try to use obscure cultural references to inflate their social position and show how smart they are. What's in a name: Couples who choose more outlandish names for their children, like Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, are more likely to be left wing . This could explain why many actors and actresses, who usually have left-wing views, choose odd names for their children such as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie who count Pax and Shiloh among their brood. Conservatives by contrast tend to opt for traditional names like John, Richard, or Katherine because the elites in society have them and they want their children to be part of the club. The findings have not yet been published but were presented at the 2013 Midwestern Political Science Association Annual Meeting in Chicago.","Conservative voters tend to choose masculine sounding names .

"‘Party powder’ designed to smell the same as cooked asparagus . Made using ‘molecular gastronomy’ techniques pioneered by Heston Blumenthal . But drugs campaigners claim it will ‘draw more people into a life of misery’ By . Anna Edwards . UPDATED: . 02:03 EST, 19 July 2011 . It certainly is an unusual way to get one of your five-a-day. In what looks like something out of TV chef Heston Blumenthal's kitchen, a London-based caterer has transformed asparagus into a powder which is  snorted by diners rather than being eaten. Bubble Foods used molecular gastronomy, which Blumenthal pioneered, to create the unusual dish, which they say provides a 'unique sensory experience'. Party powder: The powdery asparagus is meant to 'wow' diners . Diners sniff the powder, which smells the same as asparagus, notorious for making urine smell. But already drug campaigners have condemned the move, branding the unusual presentation of the green stuff as 'provocative' and glamorising drugs. But the caterers insist it is a 'tongue in cheek' move, and meant to be an innovative way of 'producing playful and exciting culinary and sensory experiences'. The white stuff: Drug campaigners say the 'tongue in cheek' presentation glamorises drugs and is irresponsible . No need for knives and forks: A chef carefully lines up the asparagus powder for dinner guests . The company says on its website that their head chef Alejandro Diaz is in charge of the metamorphosis. His menus 'transform the physical and chemical elements of ingredients beyond their original state' to bring the 'wow factor' to any dinner. No more solids: The vegetable goes through many processes before it is turned into a fine powder . Company boss Michael Collins told the Metro: 'We've started to do molecular gastronomy to make events more fun and interactive. 'It's about deconstructing and reconstructing food to stimulate all the different sense: smell, taste and vision.' But drugs campaigner Lucy Dawe, from Cannabis Skunk Sense,  branded the novelty as 'provocative and deeply irresponsible'. 'Personally, I think it's very irresponsible. People might think it's a huge joke but to me it's a very dangerous precedent to set. 'It's extremely provocative, I can see no reason to turn this into . something you can sniff - I'm sure there's lots of other ways they could . have turned it into something you can eat. 'It does risk bring more and more people into contact with drugs, a world where there's nothing but misery waiting for them.' Aside from transforming the vegetable the company can also whip up a quail trifle, encapsulated smoked duck salad, beetroot air and a corn and coconut pillow.","‘Party powder’ designed to smell the same as cooked asparagus .

A freshman Republican representative said Wednesday that August 1, the day contraception coverage goes into effect, is one of the darkest days in modern American history, likening it to the attacks on Pearl Harbour and the September 11 terrorist attacks. Speaking at a press conference Wednesday, Rep Mike Kelly (R-Pennsylvania) said that America was under attack with the mandate, saying: ‘I know in your mind you can think of times when America was attacked. One is December 7th, that’s Pearl Harbour. The other is September 11th, and that’s the day of the terrorist attack.’ He continued: ‘I want you to remember August the 1st, 2012, the attack on our religious freedom. That is a day that will live in infamy, along with those other dates.’ Anger: Rep. Mike Kelly spoke at the GOP Freshman Class Press Conference Wednesday at at Capitol Hill, likening the birth control mandate to Pearl Harbour and 9/11 . Rep Kelly, who is an outspoken supporter for the pro-life movement, made the apocalyptic comparison on Capitol Hill Wednesday. NBC News originally reported the Republican’s angry reaction to the mandate going into effect. He also called it ‘religious bigotry.’ Rep Billy Long (R-Missouri) agreed with his fellow Republican, caustically throwing out more thoughts against the HHS mandate. ‘We’re not in the land of the free anymore,’ he said, ‘and we need to get that straight.’ A spokesperson to Rep Kelly’s office did not immediately return MailOnline’s request for comment. The issue of birth control has been a hot topic in Washington and across the country, with Democrats and Republicans often seeing dramatically different views. Aside from the partisan debate, many Catholic leaders in many different dioceses rallied against the Obama administration’s health care reform. Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York wrote a letter to the president in February saying the law ‘does not meet our standard of respecting the religious liberty and moral convictions of all stakeholders in the health coverage transition. The new law requires employers – including those in religious organisations – to provide health insurance plans that in turn offer free contraception to their workers, something that many religious leaders find contradictory to their beliefs. Taking control: With the mandate going into law, non-exempt employers must provide insurance which in turn must provide birth control with no co-pays . President Obama signed the historic heath care reform bill into law in March of 2010. TPM notes that Rep Kelly’s fuming response to the bill’s passing is not the only one from a Republican representative. 'I know you can think of . times when America was attacked. One is Pearl . Harbour. The other is 9/11. I want you to remember August the 1st, 2012, the attack on . our religious freedom. That is a day that will live in infamy.' Earlier this summer, Rep Mike Pence (R-Indiana) compared the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the health care law to September 11, according to several Politico sources. Immediately after making the comment, Rep Pence issued a statement saying: ‘My remarks at the Republican Conference following the Supreme Court decision were thoughtless. I certainly did not intend to minimize any tragedy our nation has faced and I apologise.’ As of Wednesday night, Rep Kelly had not offered an apology for his statements earlier in the day. Those infuriated by his comments took to his Facebook page. Historic: President Obama, surrounded by lawmakers, is pictured on March 23, 2010, signing his signature healthcare insurance reform legislation . Look back in anger: Many protestors took to Capitol Hill in protest of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; the Supreme Court later voted to uphold it . One user wrote: ‘How embarrassing for our country. I think the congressmen ought to think carefully… then think again before he sprouts this fundamentalist garbage while wrapping himself in our flag.’ The freshman representative has already been blasted by Hawaiian Senator Daniel K. Inouye, who is a veteran of World War II. He wrote: ‘I witnessed the attack on Pearl Harbour and had the privilege of serving in the United States Army during World War II and I find the comments made by the Congressman from Pennsylvania to be misguided and insulting. ‘It is complete nonsense to suggest that a matter discussed, debated, and approved by the Congress and the President is akin to a surprise attack that killed nearly 2,500 people and launched our nation into the second World War or a terrorist attack that left nearly 3,000 dead and led to fighting and dying in Afghanistan and Iraq.’","Freshman Rep Mike Kelly (R-Pennsylvania) said Wednesday that the mandate was 'religious bigotry' and likened it to Pearl Harbour and September 11 terrorist attacks .

Scroll down for video . The missile - believed to contain Vegemite - didn't hit Labour leader Julia Gillard but it landed with a plop on the ground near her when she was mobbed by the students in Queensland today . The sandwich was thrown by a student at Australia's prime minister as she was mobbed by abusive children at a school south of Brisbane . Some of the students lining a footpath leading into the Marsden High School, south of Brisbane, yelled 'Loser' and 'Liar' as she stepped from her car and her security team had to hurry her through the crowd of angry students. Teachers ran from the building and tried to calm the students who, according to one by-stander 'went crazy'. Ms Gillard was at the school to attend an event called the Biggest Morning Tea and meet community leaders. 'It was complete chaos,' said one spectator, while Michelle Campbell, president of the Marsden High Parents and Citizens committee, said the incident was 'disappointing'. Some of the students lining a footpath leading into Marsden High School yelled 'Loser' and 'Liar' as the PM stepped from her car . Ms Gillard was at the school to attend an event called the Biggest Morning Tea and meet community leaders . She added, however, that 'kids will be kids'. Ms Gillard has called a General Election for next September, but her Party is a long way behind in the polls. One commentator on a website observed that today's incident 'serves to show that her bad performance as leader of our country has spread even to the kids' consciousness'. The Prime Minister's office later declined to comment on the incident. School officials said later that the student suspected of throwing the sandwich at Ms Gillard, named as 16-year-old Kyle Thomson, had since been suspended for 15 days. The teenager denied that he had thrown the sandwich, claiming he had tried to stop another student from throwing it. He told the Channel 9 TV network that he had hit one sandwich from the other boy's hand but had failed to stop him hurling another at Ms Gillard. His mother, who has not been named, told the network: 'Kyle's no angel, don't get me wrong, but I think there's a lot more to the circumstances.' She added: 'I'm sure she's had a lot more than a sandwich thrown at her throughout her life.' Ms Gillard, who replaced Kevin Rudd in a partyroom coup in June 2010, has seen her leadership under threat for most of the past two years . Ms Gillard said later that the incident was just 'high jinks'. 'One kid thought they might just be a little bit naughty,' she said. In March, Julia Gillard was re-elected unopposed after calling a leadership ballot. Her predecessor Kevin Rudd, whom Gillard ousted in an internal party coup in 2010, had been expected to attempt to replace her. But at the very last moment, he announced he would not contest the ballot. In what some commentators described as 'farcical' it resulted in no vote taking place and Wales-born Ms Gillard being re-elected unopposed as leader of the Labor Party. It was the second time in 13 months that the prime minister had called and survived a leadership election. It came after Ms Gillard had earlier delivered a historic national apology in Parliament to the thousands of unwed mothers who were forced by government policies to give up their babies for adoption over several decades. More than 800 people, many of them in tears, heard the apology in the Great Hall of Parliament House and responded with a standing ovation. Senior minister Simon Crean brought leadership unrest to a head earlier today by calling on his government colleagues to sign a petition to force a ballot if Gillard, who was born in Barry in the Vale of Glamorgan, refused to call one. The leadership challenge followed months of slipping polls and internal tensions that put her minority Labor government on course to be swept away at September elections. 'This is not personal. It's about the party, the future of the country,' said senior Labor minister Simon Crean at the time, calling the challenge to break a deadlock between Gillard and chief rival Mr Rudd. Gillard, who replaced Rudd in a partyroom coup in June 2010, has seen her leadership under threat for most of the past two years and her minority government has been unable to turn around a long-running slump in opinion polls, fuelled in part by internal instability, as well as flagging economic conditions. The conservative opposition led by Tony Abbott is well ahead in opinion polls and has promised to scrap a 30 percent tax on coal and iron ore mine profits, and to scrap an unpopular tax on carbon, if it wins power.","Julia Gillard was at Marsden High School, south of Brisbane, for Biggest Morning Tea event .

Justine Miliband's first foray into the election campaign trail revealed her to have been a rebel at school – including jumping out of a window to avoid being caught wearing lipstick. But the Labour leader's wife is no stranger to the cameras, having starred in TV shows as a child actor in the 1980s. She joined Ed Miliband on a visit to her old school in Nottingham this week, where the Labour leader admitted that his ‘troublemaker’ wife would have been ‘too cool’ for him. Scroll down for video . Rebel rebel: An 18-year-old Justine Thornton starred in the TV show Dramarama filmed in her hometown of Nottingham . Dramarama was filmed in Justine's hometown of Nottingham, where she returned with husband, Labour leader Ed Miliband, this week to meet pupils at her old school, West Bridgford . The couple made a rare public appearance on the campaign trail ahead of next month’s local council elections. During . a tour of West Bridgford School, it was revealed Mrs Miliband broke the . rules numerous times while she was a pupil in the 1980s. It . emerged she once leapt from a window to avoid a teacher spotting her . wearing lipstick. She also received detentions for wearing a purple coat . instead of the regulation black. But as a teenager, Justine Thornton carved out a career as an actor. She starred in the ITV series Dramarama, which ran from 1983 and helped launch the careers of talent including writer Kay Mellor and actor David Tennant. She also appeared in 1987 school-based sitcom Hardwicke House, which was axed after just two episodes after being mauled by critics. But her role as a rebellious teenager was a case of art imitating life, as Mr Miliband discovered while touring her old school. Dramarama ran from 1983-89 and was the launch pad for a host of British talent including writer Kay Mellor and actor David Tennant . Justine Miliband attended the school in Nottingham in the 1980s, when she broke rules on wearing lipstick and only wearing black coats . Mr Miliband, a self-confessed policy ‘wonk’, was surprised to learn that she received detention for flouting uniform rules. He said: ‘It's great to come back to Justine's old school. She has huge affection for it and so do I. ‘Obviously . I learned some things about her that I didn't know - that she was more . of a trouble maker than she's ever let on - wearing makeup against the . rules - but she owes a lot to this school.’ Mr Miliband visited West Bridgford School while campaigning ahead of county and unitary council elections on May 2 . Mr Miliband said she owed a great deal to the school, but had not realised what a 'troublemaker' she was . Mrs Miliband made a rare appearance on the campaign trail with her husband, ahead of the local elections on May 2 . By comparison Mr Miliband attended Haverstock Comprehensive School – dubbed the Eton of the left -  where he played the violin and became a master at the Rubik’s Cube. The couple, who have two children, tied the knot in May 2011, eight months after he beat his brother David to become Labour leader. Asked if he would have spotted Justine if they had gone to the same school, Mr Miliband suggested she would have been out of his league. ‘I would definitely have locked eyes on her,’ he told ITV News. ‘But I think she wouldn’t have had any time for me.’ Turning to his wife he added: ‘You were obviously too cool – this is what I now realise.’ The couple met pupils and staff during a rare appearance on the campaign trail . The couple, who have two children, tied the knot in May 2011, eight months after he became Labour leader . Mr Miliband is under pressure to live up to his One Nation slogan by making big gains in May 2’s local elections. The Tories have challenged Labour to win an extra 1,000 seats, although pollsters predict gains of 370 are more likely. However . he risks embarrassment that the Unite Union – one of Labour’s biggest . donor – is pushing for a general strike to bring the country to a halt . in opposition to spending cuts. He insisted he was against the strike, and would make that clear to union barons this week. He told ITV News: ‘I think it’s a terrible idea. I’m totally against a general strike. ‘We are funded by individual levy payers who are trade union members, who support the Labour Party. ‘But a general strike is a very bad idea for the country – I’m totally against it, I’m very clear about that.’ Mr Miliband defended his shadow chancellor Ed Balls as a poll revealed more people backed George Osborne to steer the economy out of trouble . He also dismissed suggestions he should ditch Ed Balls as his shadow chancellor despite a fresh poll suggesting voters have more faith in George Osborne to handle the UK economy. ‘Ed Balls is doing a great job as Shadow Chancellor,’ he said. ‘Three years ago, Ed Balls stood out against what most people thought and said 'I don't think this austerity is going to work'. What you find now, nearly three years on, is a lot more people agree with him than agreed with him at the time. Getting those judgments right is incredibly important.’ In the survey, carried out by ComRes for ITV News, only 17 per cent said they trusted Mr Balls to ‘see the country through the current economic situation’ compared with 21 per cent for Mr Osborne.","Labour leader returns to her old school in Nottingham .

Mitt and Ann are pictured with CNN's Gloria Borger . But it was Mitt's comments about the 47 per cent remark which were the most striking of the CNN interview. The secretly-recorded comments were made during a Florida fundraiser in which he claimed 'there are 47 per cent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what' because they are 'dependent on government' He added they 'believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing.' The comments were pounced on by the Democrats and provoked a media storm and proved to be decisive in the outcome of the race for the White House. When asked by CNN's Gloria Borger if he kicked himself over the remark, Mitt replied: 'Oh, yes.  I was very upset. There were a number of times that I said things that didn't come out right.

Two of the men accused of taking part in a horrific gang rape of a 16-year-old girl were 'laughing and joking' about the attack the following day, one of their friends has testified. Jose Montano, 22, and Marcelles Peter, 20, each face life in prison if convicted of assaulting the girl in Richmond, California after she left her high school homecoming dance in October 2009. As many as twenty men allegedly attacked her after plying her with alcohol. She was found bloody, bruised and covered in urine beneath a picnic table by police officers. On Thursday, a former high school student told the court in Contra Costa that Montano, Peter and a third acquaintance had laughed about how they participated in the assault. 'Vile': Jose Montano, 22, (left) and Marcelles Peter, 20, (right) laughed about participating in a gang-rape on a 16-year-old girl after her homecoming dance in October 2009, a witness has testified . 'I was uncomfortable talking about the . situation because it made me feel like that type of thing should never . happen at any schoolhouse,' the man said, the Contra Costa Times reported. The witness, who is not being named due to his fears for his safety, testified that Montano said he had sex with her and Peter said he violated her with his fingers. The third man, Ari Morales, said he urinated on her. The witness, who was a freshman at the time, said he was at home when the attack unfolded, but attorneys pointed out this contradicted previous claims he had seen the assault and tried to help her. But in court on Thursday, the man, who is now 19, said officers put words into his mouth. He added that he had originally avoided speaking to authorities as he didn't want to testify. He explained that he was 'sort of afraid of what might happen' if he did. In chains: Earlier this week, suspects (from right) Elvis Torrentes, John Crane Jr. and Jose Montano walk to a preliminary hearing in Martinez. As many as 20 men are believed to have attacked the girl . On trial: Montano's attorney said while he witnessed the grisly attack, he had no part in it . In court: Peter initially said he was not at the crime scene, but later told them he only had a 'small role' The testimony came after other witnesses described the horrifying attack in 2009. Contra Costa County Deputy District Attorney John Cope described on Monday how police found the girl propped up by a . metal beam under a picnic table half-naked and bloodied. He explained how the girl, feeling bored and . hot, had left the school dance and went outside to phone her father when . she encountered a male classmate who asked her if she wanted to come and . 'party' with them. After drinking brandy with the boys, things took a turn for the worst, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Witnesses will testify that the . victim was punched, kicked and dragged around the area. She was . assaulted with a walkie-talkie and someone urinated on her. Others . watching were invited to join in. Scene: In a photo taken October 27, 2009, police cars sit parked outside Richmond High School in Richmond, California, where a 16-year-old girl was plied with alcohol, robbed, beaten and gang-raped . As many as 20 men are thought to have . participated in the attack, Cope told the jury, with one even answering . the girl's cell phone and telling her father how good his daughter was . at sexual acts. Prosecutors also said how two condoms, a can of energy drink and a Four Loko were found at the scene. Peter's . attorney Gordon Brown told the jury in his opening statement that DNA . evidence found in a condom at the scene was unreliable and that the . crime scene had been compromised. He . said that wind from the helicopter could have compromised evidence at . the scene and carried Peter's DNA from a beer can to a broken used . condom found in the courtyard. 'I don't think we will ever know all that happened,' Brown told the jury. She was . 'incoherent and barely conscious' and covered in alcohol, urine and . dirt. Cope said Peter took part in the more than two-hour assault on the girl after she was plied with alcohol. Jailed: Ari Morales, left, who told the witness that he had urinated on the girl during the attack, and Manuel Ortega, right, and agreed to plea deals and are serving 32 and 27 years respectively . 'Participants': John Crane Jr, 43, left, turned . himself into police after the incident and Elvis Torrentes, right, faces . charges including aiding the act of rape that could land him in prison . for 26 years . She had a blood alcohol level of .35 and has no memory of the attack. On Tuesday, the father of the girl also revealed the . horrifying moment he received a vulgar call from his daughter's cell . phone from one of her attackers boasting how good she was at sex. Richmond police officer Todd Kaiser added on Thursday that he told the victim's father, who raced to the campus and searched for his daughter for about an hour, that he believed she had been raped. The father started screaming and shaking a nearby fence as he struggled to deal with the news. Kaiser said the owner of the fence told the devastated man: 'Hey, if you need to rip that fence out of the ground, you do what you have to do.' His . daughter passed by the man on a gurney and he saw her horribly beaten face and . the vomit that was in her hair, the Mercury News said.

First picture: Housekeeper Anne Lyndoe-Tavistock outside an employment tribunal in Southampton which heard she falsely accused her employer, South Dorset MP Richard Drax, of trying to entice her into a threesome with his wife . This is the lesbian housekeeper who falsely accused a Tory MP of trying to lure her into a threesome with his wife. Anne Lyndoe-Tavistock claimed she became suicidal after Richard Drax, 55, and wife Elsebet groped her and tried to perform a sex act on her as they drank wine in the sitting room of their Elizabethan stately home. But her ‘cynical’ case was dismissed at an employment tribunal after her former lover revealed she was a serial litigant who falsely accused a previous boss of sexual assault and had been awarded £16,000. Judge Roger Peters, rejected her ‘utterly incredible’ claims at the hearing in Southampton. The South Dorset MP wept as the decision was reached, and said afterwards that the claims had been ‘extremely stressful’ for his family. After the hearing on Wednesday, he said: ‘This finding vindicates our position throughout these proceedings that we acted lawfully and properly and that her serious allegations of sexual discrimination were untrue.’ Miss Lyndoe-Tavistock, 53, who lived in the Drax ancestral home, has received two other payouts in the last 15 years after bringing claims against former bosses, the tribunal heard. The housekeeper’s claims were dismissed when her estranged civil partner claimed that Miss Lyndoe-Tavistock had concocted the story for financial gain. Jo Lyndoe-Tavistock, who is divorcing her, said her former partner wanted to ‘satisfy a grudge’ and that her attitude when she was in a dispute was one of ‘I have an issue with that person, how can I get them back?’ She said her ex had brought a claim against the Royal Mail involving an alleged sexual assault, receiving a payout of £15,960. 'She . admitted to me that she had been in a tussle of some sort with a . colleague and that she had invented an allegation that he had touched . her breast,' she said. Miss Lyndoe-Tavistock received £15,960 after bringing the claim. She . received another payout from the Royal Mail after alleging she had hurt . her shoulder after the company overfilled a bag. 'In fact it was an . injury she had had for many years which was unrelated to her work,' her . civil partner said. She also received a £3,000 payout from a store where she was working after yet another dispute. Her ex-partner added said she believed the case against the MP was another attempt to 'extract money from an employer'. She told the hearing: 'She . knows Mr Drax is a public figure and I imagine she thought he was in a . strong position to secure a settlement from him as I know she has done . from previous employers. 'I . believe she concocted the allegations in her claim to cause . embarrassment to Mr and Mrs Drax and their family in the expectation . that she would receive a financial settlement.' Business leaders have now spoken out to say the case exposes the need to impose tougher penalties on workers who bring 'frivolous or malicious' claims with the hope of receiving a settlement. Cleared: The claims against Mr Drax and his wife Elsbet (left) were dismissed after Anne Lyndoe-Tavistock's former civil partner, Jo Lyndoe-Tavistock (right), told the tribunal she believed the housekeeper had  'concocted' the stories for financial gain . Mark Littlewood, the director of the . Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, told the Daily Telegraph: 'The . present system makes it too attractive for the complainant to simply . chance their arm, often causing expense and even distress to their . wholly innocent employer.' Companies . last year settled more than a quarter of employment tribunal claims out . of court despite often being given legal advice that they were likely . to win, according to a survey by the Confederation of British Industry. A fellow MP last night praised Mr . Drax's courage for fighting the case despite the 'pain, hurt and . embarrassment' caused to him and his family. Nadhim . Zahawi, the co-founder of the pollster YouGov who is now a Tory MP, . said: 'It must have been horrific for him and his family, but it was . absolutely right. 'When you think you are in the right, then you ought to take these things on.' Earlier . this week, Mr Drax said the allegations had been 'extremely stressful' for him, his wife Elsebet and his four children with his ex-wife, the . sister of former Royal nanny Tiggy Legge-Bourke. Relief: Mr Drax (right) said the allegations had been 'extremely stressful' for him, his wife Elsbet (left) and his four children with his ex-wife, the sister of former Royal nanny Tiggy Legge-Bourke . Mr Drax, . 55, a Harrow-educated former Coldstream Guards officer whose full name . is Richard Grosvenor Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax, had always denied the . claims and described himself to the hearing as a 'courteous gentleman'. The tribunal heard the housekeeper was invited to live in the Drax ancestral home, Charborough House, after previously working there as a groom. She claimed that in August she was in the staff kitchen when Norwegian-born Mrs Drax invited her to join her and her husband in their sitting room. She claimed when she entered the MP and his wife began to French kiss. Mrs Drax then started rubbing her crotch and her husband grabbed her thigh, she alleged. The housekeeper said she was 'extremely upset and scared' by their approaches and fled to her room and barricaded the door. A few weeks after the alleged assault, Miss Lyndoe-Tavistock said the MP told her she had an hour to leave, citing a series of fallings out she had had with other members of staff. She said he gave her £300 and a letter falsely claiming they had discussed disciplinary proceedings and that a severance deal would be drawn up. The housekeeper's former partner told the tribunal that when she spoke to her after she had been sacked by the MP, she boasted she had something 'big' on him. The housekeeper had claimed sexual discrimination, unfair dismissal, wrongful dismissal and for unpaid holiday pay. Mr Drax wiped his eyes as he sat holding his wife's hand as chairman of the panel, Judge Roger Peters, rejected her 'utterly incredible' claims. Outside, the MP said. 'This finding vindicates our position throughout these proceedings that we acted lawfully and properly and that her serious allegations of sexual discrimination were untrue. 'These allegations have been extremely stressful for my wife and I, and my children, and my family. We are all now relieved that we can put these matters behind us.' A spokesman for the Forum of Private Business said: 'It is wrong that one angry employee can humiliate her boss, even if there are no grounds. 'We think the culture needs to change where somebody is to blame – and that is always the employer.' Outside court, the housekeeper's solicitor said: 'We are sorry that she has not been able to prove her case at this tribunal and we will be considering an appeal.'","Anne Lyndoe-Tavistock made 'cynical' plot to win sex discrimination claim .

Victim: Well-known student activist, Clement Meric, has been left brain dead after an attack by a group of far-right skinheads . An 18-year-old student activist has been left brain dead after a brutal attack by a group of far-right skinheads in central Paris. Clement Meric,who attends the prestigious Sciences Po, was 'set about and viciously . beaten by a small gang,' said a police spokesman. 'Those responsible are believed to be . three skinheads, including a woman. All are believed to have attacked . the victim because of his political views.' The horrific crime took place last night, close to Saint-Lazare train station and not far from the Elysee Palace itself. It has already provoked widespread shock across France, where the country's Socialist government is proving incapable of curbing growing extremism. One of the attackers is said to have had a Swastika tattoo on his neck, while another used a knuckle-duster in the attack. Mr Meric, who was well known for his radical left-wing activism, was on his way shopping for clothes with friends when the attack happened. They are thought to have been goaded by the skinheads, who attacked them following an exchange of insults. Emotional: The attack has sent shockwaves through the student population of the Parisian Institut d'Etudes Politique (Institute of Political Science) Horrific: One of the attackers was said to have had a Swastika tattoo while another used a knuckleduster .

Meric was affiliated, reads: 'The horror of fascism has just killed . right in the middle of Paris.' Describing .

But Serge Ayoub, the leader of the JNR, insisted that his group played no part in the attack. 'That's absolutely false,' he said. Bertrand Delanoe, the Socialist mayor of Paris said he was 'horrified' by the attack, while Interior Minister Manuel Valls said he was determined to 'eradicate this kind of violence, which bears the mark of the extreme right.' 'There is no place for small neo-Nazi groups whose enemy is the nation,' said Valls. 'A group of the extreme right is at the heart of this assassination.

Pecking order: Prince Charles takes a keen interest in poultry on a visit to Abbey Home Farm in Cirencester . As an eager environmentalist, Prince Charles has always been keen to use his vast tracts of land to help foster some of the world’s endangered species. Now he is set to help save some rare chickens from extinction – but the crucial decision about which breeds to rescue could come down to one simple point: what colour eggs they lay. The Prince is said to favour brown eggs, which he – like the Queen – believes taste better than white ones. That opinion has little basis in science, but it could sway his judgment when it comes to choosing vulnerable breeds to add to his collection at the Highgrove Estate in Gloucestershire. Experts from the Rare Breeds Survival Trust have been asked to draw up a shortlist of hen types for Charles to consider, and will include details of their eggshells in their brief. Martin Anderson, chairman of the trust, said: ‘The Prince is a staunch supporter of rare breeds. He wishes to build up hen numbers and thought it was fitting to choose rare breeds. I will write some notes about each breed and the colour of their eggs and the Prince can choose for himself. ‘I was told he likes to eat brown eggs but I am going to suggest the breeds that need most help and not worry about the eggs.’ The colour of a breed’s egg is genetically determined, and, contrary to popular opinion, has nothing to do with diet – which is what affects the taste. A bright yolk is linked to a hen eating lots of cabbage and foraging freely on grass. The Prince already keeps a small number of hens at Highgrove, including Dutch Wellsummers and French Maran, which supply dark speckled eggs to the Royal household. Now he wants to add more, both for their eggs and to help incubate chicks of rarer breeds. Candidates for inclusion in the Royal grounds include the Modern Langshan, one of the rarest breeds in Britain, with fewer than 50 breeding hens surviving. These tall, black-feathered birds – which do lay brown eggs – were originally imported from China in 1872, but fell out of fashion during the 1930s. Another contender is the North Holland Blue, a large black and white hen that was developed in the late 19th Century. Today there are fewer than 100 breeding hens in the country. It also lays a brown egg, though it may be too pale for the Prince’s taste. Top of Mr Anderson’s list, however, is the Spanish, of which there are just a handful in Britain. This is a striking white-faced, shiny black-feathered hen, which has a long wattle– the flap of skin hanging from its neck – and resembles a bearded old man. But it produces large, white eggs. Mr Anderson said: ‘This breed needs a . lot of help and hopefully the Prince will agree to them. We know he . wants to develop the breeding side. ‘We . expect him to start with a trio of each breed he chooses, two hens and a . cockerel.  Each breed needs be kept separately and the cockerels must . be segregated from the hens.’ Poultry numbers: The Old Scots Grey (left) is becoming very rare and there are fewer than 50 Langshan hens (right) surviving in the UK . Laying low: The Rhodebar (left) lays brown eggs so could be a favourite for Prince Charles. There are fewer than 100 breeding North Holland Blue hens (right) left in the UK . Another breed at risk is the Scots Grey, which has existed in Scotland for 200 years but is now very rare, and lays a tinted white egg. The Prince, who is patron of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust, may also be attracted to the Welbar, which was created by a Devon breeder during the Second World War and which lays a distinctive terracotta egg. There is also the Rhodebar, which was developed by a Sussex breeder in 1950 and also lays brown eggs. The Prince has long been lampooned for being fussy about boiled eggs, with reports he was served seven each day to make sure there was a perfect one. But the claim, first made by Jeremy Paxman in his 2006 book On Royalty, was last year rubbished as ‘totally untrue’ by Clarence House.","Experts from Rare Breeds Survival Trust to draw up shortlist of hen types from Prince Charles to choose from .

Tipped for the top: Senior insiders believe the Very Rev Jeffrey John is a strong contender to become the next bishop of Monmouth . A controversial Church of England dean could become Britain’s first openly gay bishop. Senior insiders believe the Very Rev Jeffrey John, the dean of St Albans, is a strong contender to become the next bishop of Monmouth. If elected next month, the Welsh-born cleric would be the UK’s first Anglican bishop in a civil partnership, a development that would send shockwaves through the Church worldwide. However, insiders said the mood in Britain was changing and many worshippers would accept a gay bishop as long as he was celibate, as Dr John is. The dean, a respected theologian, is said to have been unfairly treated because of his sexuality. Dr John, a prominent advocate for gay marriage, was at the centre of a storm over gay clergy in 2003 when he was forced to step down as bishop of Reading by the then Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams after a backlash by conservatives, particularly in Africa and Asia. The men were close friends, but colleagues of Dr John, right, also accuse Dr Williams of helping to block the dean from becoming bishop of Southwark in 2010. Dr John, who has been in a civil partnership with hospital chaplain the Rev Grant Holmes for seven years, has even considered suing the Church of England for discrimination and hired a leading employment lawyer. The Church of England has now relaxed a ban on clergy in civil partnerships becoming bishops, but friends believe 60-year-old Dr John stands little chance of getting a post in England because he has been too outspoken. Rift: Dr John was forced to step down as bishop of Reading by the then Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, pictured, after a backlash by conservatives, particularly in Africa and Asia . Insiders believe that he has more chance in the Church in Wales, which is headed by its own archbishop, Barry Morgan. Archbishop Morgan, a leading liberal, has made it clear he would be happy to welcome a gay bishop. But although Dr John was born in Tonyrefail, South Wales, close to the Monmouth diocese, he has spent most of his career in the Church in England, which may prove a disadvantage when members of clergy and lay electors meet in Newport Cathedral to chose a candidate. He is expected to face stiff opposition from the clergy who feel they want a local candidate when bishop Dominic Walker steps down after ten years later this month.

Power plant employees were stunned when they spotted the man's face peering through a small opening in the ground in the city of Sishi in Fujian province. According to rescuers the man kept referring to himself as the Monkey King - a reference to classic Chinese literature - during the rescue. Monkey King: Fire crews had to rescue a man from an underground pipe in Shishi in China after he became trapped. He was only found when workers checking underground cables spotted his face through a hole in the ground . The man was discovered in the pipe by employees from a local power company who were checking underground cables. Unable to free the man themselves, the team called emergency services for help. When firefighters arrived they had to dig the pipe out of the ground before breaking it open and pulling the man to safety. It is not known why the man had crawled into the pipe or how long he was there for. During the rescue, the man kept telling firefighters that he is Sun Wukong, or the Monkey King, the lead character in one of the four great classical novels of Chinese literature, Journey To The West. The book, published anonymously in the 1590s, is thought to have been written by Wu Chengen. In the novel, monkey is born from a stone and acquires spiritual powers through practising Taoism. After . rebelling against heaven and being imprisoned under a mountain by the . Buddha, he accompanies the monk Xuanzang on a journey to retrieve the . Buddhist sutras from India. Rescued: Fire crews had to dig out the pipe and then break it open in order to rescue the trapped man . The book inspired a 1970s Japanese children's television series Monkey Magic which became a badly-dubbed cult classic in the UK. It featured memorable fight scenes in which Monkey used a magic staff that could grow in size. He could also fly on a cloud. The television series never came to a final resolution, but the book ends when Monkey learns to use his ego selflessly. The book also inspired an opera, a collaboration between Blur and Gorillaz front man Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett which was launched in London a year after its Manchester opening.

Hackers accessed 'some information' from . the Schengen Information System, a large European database on police . and judicial co-operation, said Denmark's justice minister. After Denmark police announced the investigation today, a source close to the probe said that one of the suspects is Pirate Bay founder Gottfrid Svartholm Warg. Svartholm Warg was arrested in Cambodia last year and repatriated to Sweden where he is in custody, suspected in a similar case. The source spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not allowed to speak to the media on the record. A 20-year-old Danish suspect was arrested Wednesday. Before being jailed for four weeks in pretrial custody today, the Dane, who was not identified under Danish privacy rules, pleaded not guilty, said his lawyer, Michael Juul Eriksen. National police chief Jens Henrik Hoejbjerg said the hackers copied some 4 million pieces of data but there was no immediate evidence it had been used. 'This is a very serious hacking attack on Danish police registers,' Justice Minister Morten Boedskov said. In January, police in Sweden told colleagues in Denmark about a Danish IP address they had found during an investigation into hacker attacks against a company handling sensitive information for the .

Tony Blair's multi-million-pound fortune has received an £80,000 boost from the will of his father Leo. Probate records reveal that Leo, a former barrister and law lecturer who died aged 89 last November,  left a net estate worth £295,000. His will, drawn up in 2005, left a legacy of £50,000 to his daughter Sarah, 56, who is unmarried. The rest of the estate was then divided between all three of his children, meaning Sarah, Mr Blair and their elder brother Sir William, 63, a High Court judge, each receive £80,000. Mr Blair, 60, was very close to his father and named his youngest son after him. Inheritance: Tony Blair, pictured with his wife Cherie after winning the Sedgefield seat in 2001, has been left £80,000 in the will of his father Leo, pictured right, who died last year . The former Prime Minister is notoriously secretive about his wealth, with most of his earnings since he left office in 2007 being hidden in a network of private companies. Mr Blair makes millions of pounds a year from advising business chiefs and governments. He is also one of the world’s highest-paid after-dinner speakers. It was revealed just last month how Tony Blair and his wife Cherie have added house number eight to their expanding property portfolio. Like the purchase of their seventh house, costing £1.35million in September, cash was again paid when they snapped up a £600,000 cottage for the former prime minister’s younger sister, Sarah Blair. The pretty woodland retreat – about a mile from the Blairs’ Buckinghamshire mansion for which they paid £5.75million in 2008 – was bought on Valentine’s Day earlier this year. Land Registry documents show it is owned jointly and ‘equally’ by Sarah and Cherie Blair. Close family: Tony Blair , pictured centre after his election as the Labour MP for Sedgefield in 1983 with his sister Sarah, left, father Leo, mother Olwen and older brother Bill, right . The homes the Blairs bought for their children are also co-owned by Mrs Blair. Mr Blair, 60, is said to be protective of his sister, who is unmarried, has no children and shuns publicity. He has said that they and their brother Bill were all very close and that he would often turn to his siblings for emotional support. Until recently Miss Blair lived in a £450,000 flat in Islington, North London. The Blairs also lived in Islington until the 1997 election when they moved to No 10 and sold their home only to see it rocket in value. Now the combined estimated value of the eight properties in their portfolio is nearly £21million.

A Saudi prince is suing Forbes magazine for libel because it said he was only worth $20billion in its annual rich list instead of $30billion. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, one of the world's richest businessmen, claims the magazine underestimated his wealth by £9.6billion when it placed him at 26th in this year's list. Being listed as worth $29.6billion would have placed him in the list's top ten. Alwaleed accused Forbes of 'flawed and inaccurate, displays bias against Middle East investors and financial institutions' in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph in March. The prince has now brought libel action against the magazine's publisher Randall Lane and two journalists in the High Court in London, reports the Guardian. He will claim that the Rich List caused serious harm to his reputation and to his company Kingdom Holdings' finances. His company Kingdom Holdings controls investments including stakes in Apple, Facebook, Twitter and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. His property includes the Savoy Hotel, the Plaza in New York, the Four Seasons hotel chain and a stake in the owners of London's Canary Wharf complex. Forbes calculated the prince's wealth based on the value of his known investments instead of Kingdom's share price on the Taduwal, the Saudi stock exchange, it said. The prince told the Sunday Telegraph: 'I am not pursuing it because of my wealth, but because they are accusing Saudi Arabia of being manipulated because we have no casinos. This is unacceptable.' The libel action is being brought at London's High Court . A spokesman for Forbes told the Guardian: 'We're very surprised at claims that Prince Alwaleed has decided to sue Forbes, particularly if he has done so in the United Kingdom, a jurisdiction that has nothing whatsoever to do with our recent story which raised questions about his claims about his wealth. 'The Prince's suit would be precisely the kind of libel tourism that the UK's recently-passed libel reform law is intended to thwart. We would anticipate that the London high court will agree. Forbes stands by its story.' MailOnline has approached the prince's lawyers Kobre & Kim for comment.

Rock Hudson’s wife confronted him about his homosexuality decades before the public knew he was gay - and told him to ‘grow out of it’. Phyllis Gates told her husband in 1958 that there was ‘nothing glandular’ about his interest in men, as if being gay were a disease. She also rebuked him for the ‘great speed’ with which he made love to her and accused him of picking up rent boys from the street, even after they were married. Screen idol: Rock Hudson was married to Phyllis Gates, his agent's secretary, from 1955 to 1956 . The eye-popping conversation was taped at Gates’ request by notorious Hollywood private investigator Fred Otash. He carried out surveillance on everybody from Marilyn Monroe to John F Kennedy from the mid 1950s until 1965, when his California investigator’s license was revoked. Otash was hired by Gates, an interior decorator, to keep an eye on her marriage to Hudson. It had been seen as a move to placate his fans who wanted to know why, at the age of 29, he was still single. The marriage would last just three years and ended in April 1958, supposedly because he inflicted mental cruelty on her. The conversation between them was on January 21 that year and starts off with Gates being frank about her views on homosexuality. She says: ‘There isn't anything glandular about homosexuality, it is only freezing at an emotional state, and it's up to the individual to grow out of it. ‘Everyone has to help themself, Rock.’ Gates then talks to him about conversations with his doctor and asks about a Rorschach test in which he looked at inkblots and said whatever came to his mind first. Revelations: Rock Hudson's wife, pictured left in 2004, accuses Rock Hudson in a recording made by private eye Fred Otash, left, of picking up rent boys . According to the transcript of the conversation, she says: ‘You told me you saw thousands of butterflies and also snakes. ‘[A therapist] told me in my analysis that butterflies mean femininity and snakes represent the male penis. ‘I'm not condemning you, but it seems that as long as you recognize your problem, you would want to do something about it.’ She also remonstrated with him about his ‘great speed with me, sexually’ and asked: ‘Are you that fast with boys?’ Hudson responded: ‘Well, it's a physical conjunction. Boys don't fit. So, this is why it lasts longer.’ Gates, who died in 2006, responds: ‘Everyone knows that you were picking up boys off the street shortly after we were married and have continued to do so, thinking that being married would cover up for you.’ Hudson replies that he has ‘never’ picked up any boys on the street or in bars ‘other than to give them a ride’. Hudson, who died in 1985 aged 59 due to complications related to AIDS, broke the hearts of a generation of women when his homosexuality was made public three months before his death. Talk of the town: Marilyn Monroe being interviewed in 1956. Her conversations were also recorded by Otash . He had been considered one of the most . desirable men of his day, starring alongside female screen . icons such as Doris Day in classics such as‘Pillow Talk’. Icon: Otash's files claim he cleared sleeping pills from Judy Garland's apartment . Otash died in 1992 having been used . as the inspiration for the shady PI played by Jack Nicholson in the . Oscar-winning 1974 film Chinatown. His files lay in storage for two . decades until being made public for the first time by his daughter . Colleen to The Hollywood Reporter. The tapes also detail how Otash was hired by Marilyn Monroe to monitor her when she was having sex with Kennedy - and even record her on the night that she died. In his notes he claims that on August 5 1962 she had a violent argument with the Kennedys and that she felt that she had been ‘passed around like a piece of meat’. The notes read: ‘She was really screaming and they were trying to quiet her down. ‘She’s in the bedroom and Bobby gets . the pillow and he muffles her on the bed to keep the neighbors from . hearing. She finally quieted down and then he was looking to get out of . there.’ Otash only found out she had died later on.

Inquest: David Pattrick (pictured with his wife Susan, 64, in Canada in June 2004) was found dead, face down in vomit and faeces, in a toilet cubicle . An NHS consultant has blamed a hospital system which allowed different doctors to look after the same patient for the death of a pensioner who was found collapsed in a toilet. David Pattrick, 69, was discovered lying on the floor of the cubicle two days after a gall bladder operation. An inquest heard he had complained of severe abdominal pain, which his widow, Susan, 64, said staff at Colchester General Hospital failed to investigate properly. Giving evidence at the hearing, the hospital’s professor of surgery, Roger Motson, said a system which allows different surgeons to check on post-operative patients had led to confusion about Mr Pattrick’s care. ‘A pool list was introduced to try to treat patients more quickly,’ he said. ‘It breeds uncertainty as to who is looking after a patient. It’s a reflection of doctors’ working hours and never would have happened in the past.’ Mr Pattrick, a retired banker from Marks Tey, near Colchester, was admitted to the hospital in December 2010, to have his gall bladder removed. He was told he would be able to return home the day after the routine operation but the surgeon discovered he had an infection and opted for a different procedure. He was put on antibiotics and his vital signs were monitored but on December 22 he was found collapsed in the toilet. A post mortem examination revealed he had died from septicaemia, or infection of the blood. Treatment: Mr Pattrick was found dead in a toilet cubicle in Colchester General Hospital in Essex in 2010 . The surgeon who performed the operation, Dr James Wright, told the inquest in Chelmsford: ‘In my opinion he was making good progress to getting better and going home.’ David Patrick is pictured with his wife Susan . But Mr Pattrick’s legal team questioned why staff had not become concerned at his high white blood cell count and blood sugar levels. They also said he had only seen a . nurse and a registrar with four months experience in the day before his . death. Mrs Pattrick has accused registrar Dr Kalpesh Vaghela of failing . to alert senior doctors to her husband’s abdominal pain. He told the inquest: ‘I agree some of . his levels were abnormal but not something to be alarmed at enough to . alert someone at a senior level.’ Dr Jonathan Refson, an independent . clinician, told the inquest he had concerns about how the hospital cared . for Mr Pattrick after the operation. He said the junior doctor looking after him should have raised warning signs with senior consultants. ‘There was a confusion of consultants,’ he said. ‘They are all saying it wasn’t their responsibility. No one took ownership.’ The hospital has denied wrongdoing, . but has admitted no senior doctors were able to see Mr Pattrick on the . day he died, leaving a trainee and a nurse to diagnose his symptoms when . he complained of pain. Nurse Jane Bradley-Hendricks admitted . she routinely made surgical decisions despite not being a qualified . doctor. Mrs Pattrick, an equality, diversity and disability consultant, . is suing Colchester General Hospital for other ‘failings’ in its care . for her husband.

Hate preacher Anjem Choudary has been spotted out spending his £25,000 a year benefits buying yoghurts and crisps. Dressed in a white tunic and black shoes, the cleric stepped out onto the streets of East London for the first time since his vile rant about the death of Drummer Lee Rigby. Choudary, 46, has been warned by the Met he is 'constantly' under surveillance to see if his comments are breaking the law. His bag of shopping included a toffee-flavoured Müller yoghurt and Walkers' Sensations crisps. On Tuesday a video emerged of Choudary declaring that murdered soldier Lee Rigby should 'burn in hellfire' and that his killers should be considered martyrs. The extremist maintains that despite . being executed in barbaric circumstances the 25-year-old father of one . deserves no sympathy because he was a 'non-Muslim' and called suspect Michael Adebolajo . a 'nice man'. He has persistently refused to condemn . the murder in Woolwich almost a fortnight ago and blames 'war monger' David Cameron for radicalising young British Muslims to the extent they . carry out acts of terror. A video uncovered by The Sun, shows the preacher, who claims £25,000 a year in benefits, saying that the people who murdered Drummer Rigby will go to 'Paradise'. Rally: Anjem Choudary preaches with Woolwich suspect and Michael Adebolajo (circled) behind him at a demonstration in 2007. He called Adebolajo a 'nice man' in video rant released on Tuesday . Message: The Hate Preacher said that suspect . Michael Adebolajo (left) was a 'nice man'. Adebolajo and Michael . Adebowale (right) have been charged with Lee Rigby's murder . Tragic: Drummer Lee Rigby died in the street as he walked back to his barracks in Woolwich, but Choudary says the Koran teaches that there should be no sympathy for non-Muslims . Two men have been charged with the murder and Choudary knew at least one of them, and called one of the suspects, Michael Adebolajo, 28, a 'nice man'. Filmed in an office near his mosque in north-east London, he would not denounce the soldier's death. 'So as an adult non-Muslim, whether he is part of the Army or not part of the Army, if he dies in a state of disbelief then he is going to go to the hellfire. That’s what I believe so I’m not going to feel sorry for non-Muslims.' Choudary went on that the British Government is to blame for Drummer Rigby's death, which is a 'drop in the ocean'. 'I think you need to blame the people who are inciting and who are radicalising these youths, which is really the British government. 'You need to take into account the hundreds of thousands of incidents of people slaughtered, of weddings bombed, of Muslims tortured, of innocent people kept in prison for over ten years.' He also attacked the charity Help for Heroes, which helps care for injured British soldiers, saying they cannot be heroes because they 'shoot children in Afghanistan'. Later extremist Choudary insisted he had not 'said anything incendiary' and claims he does not fear being arrested.","Extremist spotted on streets of London for first time since vile rant .

Convictions: Jan Morales has a 40-year history of appalling crimes yet was allowed to work as a paramedic . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has ordered an investigation into how the owner of a fleet of ambulances was allowed to drive vehicles and work as a paramedic – despite criminal convictions for kidnapping, assault and child pornography. The move follows serious concerns raised by a senior judge after The Mail on Sunday reported how health regulator the Care Quality Commission (CQC) granted the firm a licence. Jan Morales, co-owner of Staffordshire-based International Medical Assistance, has a string of convictions going back more than 40 years. Despite his history he had access to keys to the front doors of patients who might have to call for help. Now, after blasting the inadequate checks done on Morales by the CQC, the Care Standards Tribunal has referred the case to Mr Hunt. Earlier this year The Mail on Sunday reported that CQC granted the registration in full knowledge of Morales’s 21 child pornography  offences, for which he was jailed in 2005. But it took the CQC until this month to stop him from working with patients, even though he was on the sex offenders’ register. The MoS has been told by senior sources in the private ambulance industry that dozens of companies have never been properly inspected. Even before Morales’s firm was approved, concerns had been raised. ‘It is clear at the time of the assessment for registration, Staffordshire Police had disclosed that Mr Morales had been convicted of offences relating to child pornography,’ said tribunal judge Gillian Irving QC. ‘We found it astonishing as the facts of this case materialised that a man with the forensic history of  Mr Morales was able to hold the position of director in a company such as this. 'It was difficult to  imagine anyone less suitable or appropriate.’ Inquiry: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has ordered an investigation into how Morales was allowed to drive emergency vehicles . Observing that users of private ambulance services are ‘some of the most vulnerable in our society’, the judge worried that there is no requirement for staff to be checked through the Criminal Records Bureau. A spokesman for the CQC said: ‘We acknowledge that we should not have registered the private ambulance provider. CQC have written to the Secretary of State to make him aware of this case.’ The Department of Health said: ‘This is clearly wrong and never should have happened. We are currently looking into tightening safeguarding measures.’ Concerns: Andy Burnham . NHS bosses are increasingly using ‘poorly trained’ private ambulance crews for the most serious 999 calls as the crisis in emergency care worsens. In London the bill for using private ambulances has gone up ten-fold in two years to more than £4 million due to cuts and an increase in calls. Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘Whistleblowers have contacted Labour with concerns that even the most serious 999 calls are being handled by private ambulances without properly trained staff.’ Gary Palmer, from the GMB union, which represents paramedics, said: ‘The training of the private crews can often be less than for an NHS ambulance.’ A spokesman for Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘The NHS is seeing an extra one million more patients each year in A&E and despite the additional workload is coping well.’","Jan Morales allowed to work as a paramedic despite string of convictions .

"By . Harriet Arkell . PUBLISHED: . 07:21 EST, 2 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:22 EST, 2 May 2013 . A handwritten memo sent by Admiral Lord Nelson on the eve of the Battle of Trafalgar shows that the naval hero had more on his mind than defeating the enemy. Rather than worrying about battle plans, the 47-year-old naval tactician was thinking about onions, and how the pursers of his fleet were profiteering by using up free government supplies of them and keeping the money for food for themselves. On October 10, 1805, Lord Nelson fired off a detailed bureaucratic missive, telling the purser of every ship of his fleet not to cheat the system. Admiral Lord Nelson hand-wrote the memo on October 10 1805, just 11 days before he died at the Battle of Trafalgar . The government was sending out free onions to the ships to ensure troops received adequate vitamin C while they were away on duty, but Nelson had discovered that the pursers, whose job it was to manage the ships' budgets, were using the government onions first and keeping the money they saved from their budgets for themselves. And as the British ships were busy blockading the combined French and Spanish fleet at Cadiz, a gratuitous back-up supply of onions was shipped out to them to be used in soup by the government to prevent the troops developing scurvy. The document portrays the great naval hero as a prudent leader who was fiercely loyal to his employer at the time, the British government. It also shows that Nelson had to deal with the tedious administrative matters of running a fleet just days before going into a vital battle in the Napoleonic Wars. His signed memo reads: 'It is my positive directions that the Pursers are obliged to purchase vegetables for the ships soup when it is possible to procure them and that the Government onions are not used for the soup. 'And it is my further directions, that whenever fresh provisions can be procured on reasonable terms, that it is purchased; but that onions, for the account of Government, are not purchased without my orders. Lord Nelson was a master naval tactician who died at the age of 47 when he was hit by a French sniper . 'Ships, absent for any length of time from me, are at liberty to purchase the gratuitous onions of Government for the recruiting the health of their ships, who may have been long fed upon salt provisions.' The memo is one of two signed by Nelson that is now being sold at auction in Knowle, West Midlands, having been privately owned for more than 50 years. Andrew Baines, the curator of Nelson's . flagship HMS Victory based at Portsmouth, Hampshire, said the documents . showed another side to Nelson. 'Nelson had a responsiblity to his employer, the government, to make sure they weren't getting ripped off' He said: 'There were 31 ships in the fleet in total and each one had a purser. 'The difficulty with keeping a ship at sea with a healthy crew was massive because of the lack of vitamin C from fresh fruit and vegetables. 'The purser was required to supply these provisions and got to keep the money they didn't spend.  Sometimes they were not able to get hold of fresh produce if the ship was at sea for months. 'Where they could, the government replenished the stocks and sent out boat-loads of gratuitous onions, which were anti-scurvic.  They contained vitamin C and were easy and cheap to grow. 'But what was happening here was that when given the choice between the government onions or onions paid for out of their money, the pursers used the free ones. 'In this memo Nelson was telling them they could not use the government ones if they were able to buy them, otherwise the government was effectively paying twice. 'Nelson had a responsibility to his employer, the government and therefore the British people, and to make sure they weren't getting ripped off. The Battle of Trafalgar on October 21 1805 involved a fleet of 31 ships and was Britain's greatest naval victory . 'A lot of people think of Nelson for his brilliant military strategy and fighting battles at sea but here is the day-to-day minutiae of running a fleet, seemingly dull.' The memo, along with a second dated November 7, 1803, reminding seamen to take medical notes when going to hospitals in port, are to be sold by Knowle Auction Rooms for up to £2,000 each. Auctioneer Simon Rayner said: 'I think it is quite surprising that just days before Trafalgar, when you would have thought Nelson's mind might be on how to defeat the French and Spanish, he was getting a bee in his bonnet about onions.' The two documents are being sold by an unnamed woman from Sutton Coldfield.  The auction takes place on May 8.","Admiral Lord Nelson told ships' pursers to use their budgets to buy onions .

The debilitating condition ME is not caused by viruses, according to a study which claims to dismiss this theory ‘once and for all’. Hopes for a treatment were raised three years ago when researchers sensationally claimed that most cases of the illness - also known as chronic fatigue syndrome - may be triggered by little-known bugs in the blood. Now experts say the latest study - which involved many of the same US researchers - provides conclusive evidence that this theory was wrong. Tiredness: ME, or myalgic encephalomyelitis, affects 250,000 people in Britain and symptoms include extreme fatigue and muscle pain . The research, at Columbia University in New York, found no evidence that sufferers are infected with the rare viruses XMRV or pMLV, which are distantly related to HIV. It is believed that the 2009 study suggesting the link, which was published in a prestigious scientific journal, may have been flawed. Similar studies at King’s College London and in the Netherlands have also failed to find evidence of the viruses in the blood of sufferers. Co-author of the latest study Ian Lipkin, a professor of epidemiology, said: ‘We went ahead and set up a study to test this thing once and for all and determine whether we could find footprints of these viruses. ‘We found no evidence of infection with XMRV and pMLV. These results refute any correlation between these agents and disease.’ ME, or myalgic encephalomyelitis, affects 250,000 people in Britain and symptoms include extreme fatigue and muscle pain. Some sufferers become so weak they are bedridden or confined to a wheelchair. In profile: Some sufferers of ME, or myalgic encephalomyelitis, become so weak they are bedridden or confined to a wheelchair . It was dismissed as ‘yuppie flu’ in the Eighties and the lack of a clear cause led to scepticism over whether it was a genuine illness. It was only properly recognised in 2002 when then chief medical officer Sir Liam Donaldson said ME was a ‘debilitating and distressing condition’. In 2009 ‘spectacular’ findings published in the journal Science pinned 70 per cent of cases on the rare viruses, usually found in mice. 'We went ahead and set up a study to test this thing once and for all and determine whether we could find footprints of these viruses. We found no evidence of infection with XMRV and pMLV. These results refute any correlation between these agents and disease' Ian Lipkin, epidemiology professor . It is now thought these results may have been contaminated and the journal has retracted the research from the Whittemore Peterson Institute in Nevada. This time researchers took ‘extraordinary care’ to eliminate contamination in the chemicals used in the study, which tested the blood of 147 ME patients and a similar sized group of healthy volunteers. Speaking of the findings, published in mBio, the journal of the American Society for Microbiology, Professor Lipkin said: ‘We’ve tested the XMRV/pMLV hypothesis and found it wanting. ‘But we are not abandoning the patients. We’re not abandoning the science.’ Experts believe there may be a genetic cause for ME, or it may be triggered by a traumatic event or a weakness in the immune system.","Researchers thought bugs in blood may trigger illness .

In private, however, it seems Chuka Umunna – hailed by his admirers as Britain’s Barack Obama – is happy to be a man of the social elite, with a distinct taste for the high life. The former DJ, now Labour’s shadow business secretary, belongs to an exclusive online club for so-called ‘jetrosexuals’, where he asked for tips on the best nightspots to avoid the ‘trash and C-list wannabes’ of London’s West End. Fellow members of ASmallWorld, which has been described as MySpace for millionaires, reportedly include Tiger Woods and Naomi Campbell. The invitation-only website, which was founded by Swedish investment banker Erik Wachtmeister, currently features an article about ‘mile-high hook-ups’ on private jets. It has also been described as a hunting ground for ‘sugar daddies’. Mr Umunna, the 34-year-old centre-left MP for Streatham, South London, is registered on the social network with his middle name, Harrison. In July 2006 Mr Umunna was still working as an employment lawyer, but was beginning to make a name for himself as a left-wing commentator. On ASmallWorld, however, he was bemoaning the lack of ‘decent’ clubs in London’s West End, writing: ‘Is it just me or is there a serious lack of cool places to go in central London at the weekends. ‘Most of the West End haunts seem to be full of trash and C-list wannabes, while other places that should know better opt for the cheesy vibe.’ Praising a club he had recently visited in Kensington, he asked for suggestions for ‘a trash-free, decent night’. Two years later, when he was hunting for a safe Labour seat, Mr Umunna turned to the website for more advice, this time for ‘what’s hot right now’ in Miami. He said he was spending ten days in the city, and listed a string of exclusive clubs he had visited during a previous trip. These included Mynt Lounge, which boasts of having the ‘tightest door policy and the most fabulous crowd’. Reveller: Mr Umunna, the 34-year-old centre-left MP for Streatham, South London, is registered on the social network with his middle name, Harrison . A-list: Fellow members of ASmallWorld reportedly include Tiger Woods and Naomi Campbell . It is visited by ‘A-list celebrities’ including Ricky Martin, Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan and Britney Spears. Its owner Romain Zago says: ‘Mynt is for the famous and fabulous’. Mr Umunna’s other favourite, Mokai, promotes ‘Sexy Bitch Wednesdays’ which are reputed to attract ‘A-list celebrities’. It also runs Weekend Warrior Fridays, where ‘everyone is beautiful after 4am’. He also took time to visit Nikki Beach, an oceanfront ‘sexy South Beach nightclub’ and Forge, which holds champagne happy hours. A PR for the elite Opium string of clubs contacted Mr Umunna through the social network and offered him VIP passes, but last night the MP said he had not accepted the freebies. But he did accept an invitation to a private party for ASmallWorld members at the British Luxury Club in London, which features a bar made of Swarovski crystals. Tory MP Chris Heaton-Harris said: ‘In public [Mr Umunna] likes to portray himself as a man of the people. Yet we know in private he has a lack of respect for the public. ‘Chuka, or should I say Harrison, has been outed as the ultimate champagne socialist who revels in living the high life, brands the public C-list celebrities and trashes our capital city. You can’t get more out of touch than that.’ While he has not posted on the site since he became an MP, Mr Umunna last night confirmed that he is still a member of ASmallWorld. When contacted by the Mail, he apologised for any offence caused by the comments. A spokesman for Mr Umunna said: ‘Chuka used the ASmallWorld social network in the past, which is similar to Facebook. Up and coming: Chuka Umunna pictured signing autographs for schoolchildren . ‘Though his user account on the site still exists, he has not posted a thread on the site for many years, since long before he was elected as a Member of Parliament.’ The spokesman also said that Mr Umunna’s interest in ‘house music’ was well known, as he used to be a DJ. He added: ‘In terms of the post from 2006, these were comments made on a private social network well over half a decade ago. ‘Though light-hearted in tone and context, and made long before he became an MP, Chuka accepts the choice of words used were not appropriate and apologises if any offence may have been caused.’","Mr Umunna is a member of ASmallWorld, dubbed MySpace for millionaires .

Two rare bottles of whisky salvaged from a shipwreck off Eriskay in 1941 which inspired a book and film Whisky Galore to be auctioned . A whisky collector has paid more than £12,000 for two bottles of now-undrinkable whisky salvaged from a shipwreck which inspired a book and a film. The collectors' items were sold as a pair by Britain's biggest internet-only auction site Scotch Whisky Auctions, based in Glasgow, after more than a week of bidding which closed on Sunday. The bottles, which have documents of authentication, were part of the cargo on the 8,000-ton cargo ship the SS Politician, which sank off the shores of Eriskay in the Outer Hebrides in 1941 and inspired the book and film Whisky Galore. They were bought by an unidentified UK buyer who fought off rival bids from collectors around the world to win the auction with his or her bid of £12,050. Scotch Whisky Auctions director Bill Mackintosh said: 'I'm obviously very, very pleased for the people on whose behalf we sold it and I just think it's an incredible figure. 'It's not a whisky anybody's going to drink so they've bought it for its scarcity value and the fact that it's a fantastic part of Scotland's social history.' He added: 'Everybody loves the idea of the wily islanders diving to the bottom of . the wreck and coming back up with bottles of whisky which they would then hide . from the customs. 'But it is true that there are only eight which have . have been authenticated recently and these are two of those which were sold at . Christie's some time ago.' The eight bottles surfaced in 1987 when local man Donald . MacPhee from South Uist in the Outer Hebrides explored the wreck and found his . liquid treasure. He sold them at auction with Christie's and got £4,000 . for his loot. Two of those bottles were bought by a man in Fraserburgh . in Aberdeenshire.

Theresa May revealed that more police will monitor the event to prevent a repeated of the horrific terror attack at the finish line of the race in America on Monday. Giving evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee, Mrs May said: 'They’ve made some adjustments to policing. They’ve put in some increased policing for the marathon.' Nearly all of those who had signed up for Sunday's race say they will run despite the attack, although some admit they are nervous for the safety of spectators. Scroll down for video . Security: Theresa May has revealed more police will be on duty at the London Marathon, where runners will be wearing black ribbons like the one pictured right . Runner: Olympic gold medallist Mo Farah is planning to run a half-marathon during Sunday's race . Nick Clegg today insisted everything possible was being done to ensure the London Marathon passes off safely following the Boston bombing. The marathon, which will be preceded by 30 seconds' silence for the bombing victims, will feature an appearance by Prince Harry. The attack in Boston on Monday saw two bombs go off at the finish line of the famous race, killing three people and injuring more than 170. But a number of London runners told ITV News last night that they would not be cowed by the terrorist atrocity. 'There's . going to be an element of worry but they are ultimately there to . support us and everyone's going to stick together,' one said. 'We are . not going to let anybody put us off finishing.' Atrocity: Runners in the London Marathon have vowed to continue despite the carnage in Boston, pictured . One mother of three said she was worried about spectators being hurt at the event, saying: 'I'm not taking my children now because they are just nine months, four and five and I don't feel comfortable about taking them.' Another added: 'I have a question mark over whether my husband will bring my six-year-old daughter to the finish line. 'We have tickets for the grandstand through the charity we are running for and obviously since Boston that makes us feel a little bit nervous.' In his weekly LBC 97.3 radio . phone-in, the Deputy Prime Minister said the images from the United . States had been 'heartbreaking' and he understood that people were . anxious.

'To see all these pictures of these happy families on a summer day at the finishing line, and of course these photos of this poor little eight-year-old, is just heartbreaking. So anxiety is the most natural response to that.' In attendance: Prince Harry will hand out medals at the race, which will feature well-known competitors such as former England captain Andrew Strauss, right . Prince Harry has a long-standing commitment to preside over the medal ceremony at the end of the race, and Palace sources this week said that his plans had not changed. Runners will be encouraged to wear a black ribbon to commemorate the victims of the Boston bombing. Marathon chief executive Nick Bitel said he was confident the race would be safe and would be an event in which 'humanity can be united'. 'One of the great things about the London Marathon is that it is perceived as being this event that brings people together,' he said. 'One of the founding principles of the London Marathon was to show that at least on one day humanity can be united. 'We instigated a full security review. Considerable extra police and our own security resources will be employed. 'London . is one of the safest cities in the world. We saw last year with the .

The 36-year-old will represent the Lord's Taverners charity in the race. It is not the first time Mr Strauss has had to stand firm in the face of terror fears, as he was part of the England team which toured India in the aftermath of the Mumbai attacks in 2008. 'It's a horrendous tragedy and I think this is an opportunity for all of us that are involved in the London Marathon to come out and do our bit and show a bit of solidarity and also show that we're not going to cower with fear,' he said.

MPs are to investigate claims that the Pentagon is running a secret drone war from RAF bases inside the UK. The move follows The Mail on Sunday’s revelation last week that a drones company is openly recruiting US security-cleared staff to work on American military operations from Britain. Bosh Global Services, the firm at the centre of the allegations, wants drone personnel to work at RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire. Evidence: MPs from the all-party parliamentary group on drones will now consider evidence as to whether US Predator drones are being operated from RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire . Bosh says the new staff should have military experience and will support the US Air Force’s armed drone, the Predator, which has killed hundreds of people in Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen. MPs from the all-party parliamentary group on drones will now consider the evidence of a US ‘operations centre’ at the RAF base at their next meeting. John Hemming MP, treasurer of the parliamentary group, said: ‘If Americans are involved in extra-judicial killings from the UK then we should be told.’ The committee’s action is supported by Labour’s former Security Minister Lord West of Spithead, who said: ‘If there are drone attacks being operated by the Americans from this country against targets in countries with which we are not at war, then I, the public and Parliament should be made aware.’ Recruitment: US company Bosh Global Services has been advertising for staff at the RAF base to support the US Air Force's armed drone. A US solider operated a Reaper drone remotely in Nevada (above) Last week Bosh pulled the recruitment documents from its website and removed all references to RAF Waddington. The revelation has sparked claims of British complicity in the USAF assassination programme, which human rights groups have branded unlawful and is now being investigated by the United Nations. RAF Waddington has been designated as Britain’s first drone centre but will not be operational until next year, when it will fly five fully armed Reaper drones. Last night the Ministry of Defence confirmed that Virginia-based Bosh was working at RAF Waddington but was only supporting UK operations.

A sex-trafficking case that has already featured several prostitutes taking the stand to defend their pimps drew to a close on Thursday when the court heard summations. The defense lawyer for the father and son pimps Vincent George, Sr. and Jr., told the court that many woman would die for the kind of lifestyle that the hookers had. ‘I'm trying to find a job myself that pays me $10,000 a week,’ said defense lawyer Howard Greenberg who is representing George Snr. Father and son pimps Vincent George, Sr. and Jr. have pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and money laundering charges . Howard Greenberg, defense lawyer for the father and son pimps Vincent George, Sr. and Jr., told the court that many woman would die for the kind of lifestyle that the hookers had . He reminded the court that the five women were provided with homes, cars and even four years maternity leave, reports the New York Post. ‘The girls wanted for nothing,’ he told Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Ruth Pickholz, who will render a verdict in the non-jury trial. The women say they were one big happy family and enjoyed a comfortable suburban life as ‘wife-in-laws’ in Pennsylvania. At night, they commuted to work in Manhattan. But prosecutors say the women were coerced into prostitution by a father-and-son team that threatened them with beatings, withheld money and referred to them as animals. 'Happy hookers': Self-proclaimed prostitutes Danielle Geissler (left), Heather Keith (center) and Desiree Ellis (right) have testified in defense of their alleged pimps, a father-and-son duo . ‘If those threats had been real… there would have been medical records stacked a mile high,’ said Junior's lawyer, David Epstein. Vincent George Sr. and Vincent George Jr. have pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking, money laundering and other charges. Prosecutors say the women made as much as $500,000 a year for the Georges but got little money themselves. Desiree Ellis, one of the prostitutes told a Manhattan Courtroom last week that she and Vincent George Sr would get over their big fights: 'we kissed, we made up, we had a love session.' 'He's a teddy bear!' she testified. Vincent George Sr., right, and Vincent George Jr. sit in the courtroom before the start of closing arguments in New York on Thursday . 'We were happy,' she said of their 'family' style life where the three self-proclaimed prostitutes who are testifying in the case lived alongside the father-son pimp pair. Ellis testified how she and fellow prostitutes Danielle Geissler and Heather Keith, who is eight months pregnant with another man's child, all tried to continue their 'happy' lifestyle while the two Vincents were in jail on sex trafficking and prostitution promotion charges. They really missed the younger Vincent, who they lovingly called 'Ko', on Memorial Day when they had a barbeque because that was 'not really our department. The grill man is Junior...We were pretty unsuccessful there.' She said that one of the problems that came up both during and after the alleged pimps were arrested was the division of their time among the women. 'When you have one person who can’t split into five different directions, you get a little jealous,' she said. No complaints: Desiree Ellis is one of three self-proclaimed prostitutes testifying in the case against Vincent Sr and his son George Vincent Jr . Desiree Ellis shows a picture of what she says is her house in Allentown, PA . Vincent George, 55, and his son Vincent Georg Jr, 35, have been charged with money laundering and sex trafficking for allegedly forcing five young women into prostitution, and then beating them and withholding money from them. However, self-proclaimed prostitutes Danielle Geissler, 31, and 26-year-old Heather Keith painted a far rosier picture of their relationship with the alleged pimps in their testimonies last Tuesday. The women gushed about their cars, furnished homes, refrigerators filled with food, luxury ski and beach vacations, as well as a fully paid four-year maternity leave for Geissler. 'Did anyone named George force you to become a ho?' blunt defense lawyer Greenberg asked Keith, who replied 'No,' according to the New York Post. Third 'happy hooker' testifies about how great her pimp was - and how they'd have sex after fights . Taking the stand to a packed Manhattan courtroom last Tuesday, Geissler, dressed in a conservative tan pantsuit, described George Jr as her sweetheart and 'daddy,' said that she was in love with him and praised him for being a good father to their 8-year-old daughter. The 31-year-old 'lady of the night’ went on to boast about all the material fringe benefits that came with their illicit lifestyle, telling the court that each of the women in the Georges' harem had their own houses and cars, including her 1999 BMW and 1995 Nissan Maxima. She also shared with the courtroom that the Georges would take them on 'fabulous’ vacations to Florida and Vermont. Witness: Danielle Geissler, 31, strides into a Manhattan courtroom to take the stand last Tuesday in the trial of the father of her child, who also doubles as her pimp . Keeping it classy: Geissler, dressed in a conservative tan pantsuit accessorized with a large cross dangling from her neck, described Vincent George Jr as her sweetheart and 'daddy,' and said that she was in love with him . While the prosecution alleged that the father-son pimps had coerced the five women into selling their bodies for profit, threatened them and treated them like sex war horses, Geissler insisted that they all got along very well. 'We all took care of each other,' she said, adding that the women jokingly called one another 'wife-in-laws' and 'b****es.' At one point during the proceedings, Keith was questioned about a tattoo of a bar code on her neck below George Jr's street name, ‘King Kobe.' The prosecution claimed that the body art served as evidence that the alleged pimps treated the women like their property, but the 26-year-old, who is 8-months-pregnant with another man’s baby - insisted that the tattoo was her own choice. 'It was my way to show him that I cared about him, that I loved him,' she said. In her testimony, Geissler, who worked for George Jr from age 18, conceded that life with her ‘sugar daddy’ was not without its low points. Heather Keith, who is eight months pregnant with another man's child, defended the two men for whom she worked . ‘We slapped each other around sometimes but never over work or staying in the life,' she said, clarifying that things would at times turn violent when she was not sexually satisfied. 'If I didn't get it, I'd hate the world,' she added, according to the New York Daily News. The suspected sex traffickers were arrested last year for allegedly using a music recording company and livery cab service to launder money from the prostitution ring. The five blondes from Pennsylvania would drive into New York City and work eight-hour shifts, turning tricks for $300 each in the backseat of clients' cars or posh Manhattan hotel rooms, according to testimony. The prosecution’s case against the father and son includes hundreds of hours of profanity-filled phone conversations between the alleged pimps and their employees. On one call, the younger George could be heard threatening to beat one of the prostitutes if she fails to get him money or check in every two hours. The good life: Geissler testified that her pimps treated her and the other women well, furnishing them with houses, cars, fully stocked refrigerators, and even taking them on ski and beach vacations . Sister wives: The 31-year-old 'working girl' said in court that George Jr proposed to her and to three of her colleagues, and suggested that they all move to Africa so they could get married . Geissler, however, said on the witness stand that she never took George Jr's threats seriously and kept the money she made, according to the New York Times. She also revealed that after his arrest, the 35-year-old suspect proposed marriage to her and three of her colleagues, and even suggested they all move to Africa where they could legally marry. The Georges' defense team do not deny that the men were promoting prostitution, but they are fighting the sex trafficking charges, which could land their clients behind bars for up to 25 years, if convicted. ‘The women, simply put, worked as hos . because they wanted to,’ Greenberg said.’ Of course they're promoting . prostitutes ... what's the big deal?’ Last . Wednesday, the procession of 'happy hookers' continued in Manhattan, . with self-described prostitute Desiree 'Jessica' Ellis taking the stand. CBS New York reported. With a smile on her face, Ellis bragged about her five-bedroom houses and access to George Jr's cars and cash. ‘I didn’t have a desire to change anything about my life,’ Ellis testified. Willing participant: Heather Keith, who is eight-months pregnant, denied in court that the Georges had forced her into becoming a 'ho,' as the defense attorney phrased it . Marked woman: Keith was asked about a tattoo of a bar code on her neck below George Jr's street name, 'King Kobe,' which the prosecutors suggested was a sign that she was the pimp's property.

He is the fourth suspect to be taken . into custody in the March 30 attack on the American and her French . companion, who were held for six hours, robbed and beaten before being . dumped by the roadside. The other three suspects, aged 20-22, include the van's driver. The report says the teenager was the . van's money-taker. It says he has acknowledged robbing the couple and . beating the man but denied taking part in the rape. Scroll down for video . Suspects Wallace Aparecido Souza Silva, left, Carlos Armando Costa dos Santos, center, and Jonathan Foudakis de Souza are presented to the press at the Special Police Unit for Tourism Support (DEAT) Jonathan Froudakis de Souza (left) and Wallace Aparecido Silva (right) have been accused of raping an American tourist on a minibus in Rio de Janeiro . Police have said a male foreign tourist was also held captive and robbed on the minibus . The horrific crime has sparked fear . among visitors to the metropolis, which is set to host next year's . football World Cup as well as the 2016 Olympics. A few minutes after the pair of . tourists boarded the mini-bus, the operators ordered the . other passengers to get off and inflicted a 'party of evil' on the . couple. The three assailants took turns . raping the woman and beating the man, whom they handcuffed and sometimes . struck with a metal crowbar, police investigator Alexandre Braga said . yesterday. The men split up the driving, ending . up in Rio's sister city of Niteroi across, where they went on a spending . spree with the foreigners' credit cards. Once they hit the limit on both . cards, spending around $500 at gas stations and convenience stores, the . suspects drove the pair back to Rio and forced the woman to fetch . another credit card, Mr Braga said. He said that she did not dare call . for help at this point 'because the young man was still under the . suspects' control and she feared something even worse might happen to . him'. Around six hours after they were . kidnapped, the tourists - both in their early 20s - were dumped by the . side of highway 30 miles away from Rio. They managed to reach a consulate, . where staff helped them contact police. The woman has returned home, . while the man is still in Brazil helping officers with their inquiries. Wallace Aparecido Souza Silva, Carlos . Armando Costa dos Santos and Jonathan Foudakis de Souza have been . arrested on suspicion of the crime. 'The victims recognised the three . without a shadow of a doubt,' Mr Braga said. The men's mug shots were . also recognised by another woman who said she'd been raped by the three . under similar circumstances last month. Two of the suspects have confessed to Saturday's attack, while the third denies any responsibility. Left to right: Jonathan Froudakis de Souza, Carlos Armando Costa dos Santos and Wallace Aparecido Silva, who allegedly raped a foreign tourist in a minibus in Rio de Janeiro on March 30, 2013 . It has been reported that the woman and man boarded the minibus in the Copacabana beach district in Rio de Janeiro early on Saturday . Many are now asking whether Rio . authorities, who have succeeded in cracking down on much of the city's . drug violence, are up to the task of protecting the waves of tourists . expected to flood the city during the World Cup and Olympics. Some 2million people are also . expected to flock to the city in late July for World Youth Day, a Roman . Catholic pilgrimage that Pope Francis is scheduled to attend. Observers said the attack came as a . particular shock given that safety has improved at least in the city's . tourist-friendly seaside neighbourhoods. 'No one expects to be attacked in . Disneyland, handcuffed and roughed up,' said Alfredo Lopes, the head of . the hotel association. 'Copacabana is our Disneyland.' Three men boarded the minibus after the woman and her boyfriend got on and forced all the other passengers off, Rio police said . Police have said a Brazilian woman who was raped a week earlier has also identified the suspects . The suspects allegedly rented their . van, which seats about a dozen people and has dark tinted windows, from . the vehicle's owner, who has not been linked to the attack. Rio's van services are widely reviled . for their precarious safety conditions and reckless driving, as well as . their links to organised crime. Some vans are run by militias largely . composed of former police and firemen who control large swaths of the . city's slums and run clandestine transportation and other services. In . general, tourists avoid the vans and opt for regular buses or taxis. Australian visitors Emma Richardson . and Jason Sestic said they have been taking extraordinary precautions . throughout their weeklong stay in Rio. 'We've stayed well away from .

A former airline pilot murdered his estranged wife by deliberately crashing his car into a tree at more than 50mph after the passenger airbag had been disabled, a court heard yesterday. Iain Lawrence purposely careered off a bend on a quiet country road in order to kill his 47-year-old wife in a ‘most cunning way’, it was claimed. Despite being ‘fanatical’ about wearing a seatbelt, Sally Lawrence was not strapped in, jurors were told yesterday. Her husband, however, was wearing his seatbelt. 'Cunning': A court sketch shows Iain Lawrence in the dock at Leicester Crown Court where he stands accused of murdering his wife Sally, right, by deliberately crashing his car into a tree as she rode in the passenger seat . Mrs Lawrence, the managing director of . a business that specialised in cleaning up chemical spills, was said to . have been terrified of her husband in the months before her death, even . telling one friend: ‘One day he will kill me.’ Leicester Crown Court heard that she would never have got into his car unless forced or tricked. Prosecutor Nirmal Shant QC said . Lawrence, who ran a car trailer business, had been unable to accept that . his wife wanted a divorce and had started a new relationship. He killed her, the barrister said, ‘out of greed, anger and possibly jealousy’. Miss Shant told the jury: ‘The car was . driven into a tree and the deceased died almost instantaneously because . the airbag didn’t detonate – and the reason the airbag didn’t detonate . was because it had been switched off. ‘The question for you is, “Who . switched the airbag off?” His airbag was on, hers off. He was wearing . his seatbelt, she wasn’t. Him in the brace position, her dead. 'She was fearful he might do something . to her, and that is exactly what he did, in the most cunning way, in a . plan that was not likely, he thought, to raise suspicion.’ The couple had a ten-year-old son, who was away on a school trip at the time of  the crash. Gartree Road near Leicester, where Mrs Lawrrence died: An examination of her husband's car's data recording system found that 'someone' had turned the passenger side airbag off 'six cycles' before the crash . Mrs Lawrence, who also had two adult daughters from a previous marriage, suffered no injuries consistent with wearing a belt. The Crown claims she was either not . wearing one, or did not have it clipped in. Miss Shant told jurors: ‘If . she wasn’t wearing a seatbelt, you have to ask yourself who unclipped . it.’ She said accident investigators found . no evidence that Lawrence, 53, had attempted an emergency stop, and that . the passenger side of his Peugeot 406 received the ‘brunt’ of the . collision. He escaped the crash with minor . injuries – and bruising consistent with being in the ‘brace’ position at . the time he crashed into the tree at an estimated 52.3mph. A police officer who examined the . scene concluded that the vehicle had partly negotiated a bend and then . taken a ‘different and deliberate’ course that led to the tree. Miss Shant said it was a mystery what . Mrs Lawrence was doing in her husband’s car. She had her own Jaguar and . would ‘never willingly’ travel in his vehicle. When police examined the Jaguar, which . was at the estranged couple’s home in Oadby, near Leicester, last . October, they found it contained Mrs Lawrence’s purse, phone, laptop and . overnight bag. She had been planning to spend the night with her new . partner, Martin Smith, the court heard. Splitting the assets: The Lawrences' £300,000 family home in Oadby, which the couple still shared. The court heard they had an 'acrimonious' discussion about the division of their assets the day before the crash . Mr Lawrence's Peugeot 406: The 'brunt' of the damage, pictured here before the collision, was received by the passenger side, and there was no evidence the suspect had attempted an emergency stop, the court heard . Mrs Lawrence suffered multiple injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash near their home village. The prosecutor added that Lawrence . claimed to have no recollection of the crash but a number of witnesses . at the scene believed he was ‘faking’ unconsciousness. Miss Shant said ‘matters had been . brought to a head’ a day before the crash when Mrs Lawrence had an . ‘acrimonious’ discussion with her husband about the division of assets, . particularly the £300,000 home they still shared despite living . ‘separate lives’. In text messages to one of her . daughters that night, she said the conversation had gone badly because . Lawrence wanted ‘more than half’ of  the house, and that she planned to . lock herself in her bedroom because she was so scared of him. Miss Shant said Lawrence had previously told his wife in a ‘menacing’ way: ‘You’ll get your feelings back for me.’ She also told a work colleague her husband ‘had evil in his eyes’ when they spoke, and that she feared being alone with him. The couple had married in 2000, but the marriage ran into difficulties and Mrs Lawrence began divorce proceedings last year. The decree absolute was issued the month following her death. Lawrence denies murder. The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Iain Lawrence accused of killing his wife Sally in a 'most cunning way'

A Samurai sword-wielding Mormon bishop helped a female neighbor in Salt Lake City, Utah escape a Tuesday morning attack by a man who had been stalking her. Kent Hendrix woke up Tuesday to his teenage son pounding on his bedroom door and telling him somebody was being mugged in front of their house. The 47-year-old father of six rushed out the door and grabbed the weapon closest to him - a 29-inch high carbon steel Samurai sword. Mormon bishop Kent Hendrix, 47, draws his sword near his house in Salt Lake City on Tuesday . He came upon what he describes as a melee between a woman and a man. His son stayed inside to call 911 while he approached the man along with other neighbors who came to help. The martial arts instructor didn't hesitate in drawing the sword and yelling at him to get on the ground. 'His eyes got as big as saucers and he kind of gasped and jumped back,' Hendrix said by phone Tuesday afternoon. 'He's probably never had anyone draw a sword on him before.' The man ran down the street with the barefoot Hendrix and others in pursuit. Hendrix said he couldn't catch the man before he fled in his car, but he picked up ChapStick that the man dropped and memorized his license plate. 'I yelled at him, ""I've got your DNA and I've got your license plate: You are so done,'"" Hendrix said.

He was booked on charges of robbery, attempted burglary, trespassing and violation of a stalking injunction. Hendrix, a pharmaceutical statistician, was one of several neighbors who came to the woman's aid after she began yelling for help, Hoyal said. The incident began just after 7 a.m. when the 35-year-old woman came out of her front door, Hoyal said. Eggersten was hiding behind her carport and attacked her, knocking her to the ground, Hoyal said. He took her keys and tried to open the door into her house, Hoyal said. That's when the woman ran down the street calling for help. The woman did the right thing by fighting back and calling for help, Hoyal said. She suffered minor injuries. Hendrix, a bishop in The Church of . Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, said it was the first time in 30 . years of practicing martial arts that he's used the sword. He didn't . swing it at the man, only showing him he had it. He . said he's proud of his 14-year-old son for alerting him and quickly . calling 911.

A seven foot alligator has been confiscated and its owner faces animal cruelty charges after it was found caged in a plastic box in an Ohio basement. Vets say that the gator is severely undernourished, has damaged teeth and bone disease from a lack of sunlight after being kept locked away in the basement of the house for 15 years. The reptile was discovered after a video emerged on Facebook of it being taunted by teenagers. Dangerous pet: Vets are pictured carrying the alligator to be checked over after it was rescued from the basement of a house in Ohio . Freed: The alligator is believed to have been kept in a plastic tub in the basement for around 15 years . Poor condition: Vets say that the alligator is missing several teeth and is severely malnourished . The footage showed a young man laughing as he throws beer on the alligator which reacts by biting the plastic box it was kept in. According to the Humane Society of Greater Dayton which seized the animal, the youngsters filmed taunting the gator may also face cruelty charges. Tim Harrison, director of Outreach For Animals, a group which rescues exotic animals in Ohio, said that rumours that there was an alligator in the basement of the house had been circulating for more than two years. But authorities could not enter the property without any evidence. That evidence came in the form of the Facebook clip. Lack of light: Due to being kept indoors for so long, the alligator is lacking in vitamin D say vets . New home: The alligator will be moved to a refuge in Florida later this week where it will receive treatment . It is believed that the owner of the alligator would leave the door to his basement open and allow pupils from a local high school to come in and see the alligator even when he wasn't there. It is believed that he was out when the Facebook video was shot. According to Mr Harrison, the reptile has weakened and missing teeth and there were bite marks all over the concrete wall next to the alligator's tub indicating that it had repeateadly jerked its head from previous taunts. As well as its damaged teeth, the alligator is severely undernourished - it should be around 10 ft long instead of seven. Bullied: The alligator was rescued after a video emerged on Facebook of teenagers taunting the reptile in the basement . Beast: The alligator is only seven foot long when it should be around 10ft . Because it has been kept in the basement for so long, it is also severely lacking in vitamin D. Mr Harrison told SFGate: 'When we brought him out in to the sun, he actually just closed his eyes for a long time. It was really sad.' The alligator will be moved to a refuge in Florida and kept in a specially made outdoor area. President of the Humane Society of Greater Dayton warned others against keeping exotic animals as pets.

A state-of-the-art scanner that produces live 3D X-rays of a patient's body during surgery has been used for the first time in an NHS hospital. The machine means that surgeons no longer have to rely on low-quality images taken prior to the operation. Surgeons at The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital (RNOH) in North West London are using the £500,000 scanner to carry out complex spinal operations more efficiently and safely. The Medtronic O-Arm imaging scanner is a revolutionary type of X-ray machine that can circulate 360 degrees around a patient in just 13 seconds to deliver live 2D and 3D images of a patient . It allows the surgeon to manipulate images created by the scan so that they can view a variety of different 3D and 2D angles of the patient’s anatomy, including detailed images of the spine and bone structure. It also allows for much higher resolution and quality images than existing intra-operative imaging. The Medtronic O-Arm imaging scanner is a revolutionary type of X-ray machine that can circulate 360 degrees around a patient in just 13 seconds, resulting in both the radiographer and the surgeon having significantly less exposure to radiation. Once the images are obtained the surgeons can use the hi-tech navigation technology to insert metalwork into the spine safely, significantly reducing the risk of injury to the spinal cord and nerves. The scanner can also provide traditional 2D X-rays (pictured).Surgeons at The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in London are using the £500,000 scanner to carry out complex spinal operations more efficiently and safely . The device is so accurate that it also reduces the chance that the surgeon will have to adjust the position of screws and rods after they have been inserted. The new technology will also help improve surgery for patients with complex spinal deformities and anatomy. Mr Robert Lee, RNOH consultant orthopaedic and spinal surgeon, said: ‘We are delighted to be able to have this brand new technology available to improve care for our patients. Once the images are obtained, the surgeons can use the hi-tech navigation technology to insert metalwork into the spine safely, significantly reducing the risk of injury to the spinal cord and nerves . ‘This really is a breakthrough in medical technology that will make performing an operation much safer and easier. ‘Surgeons will be able to pinpoint exactly where surgical implants, such as metal screws, should be positioned along the spine, providing much greater accuracy and safety. ‘Being able to perform procedures in this way will ultimately reduce the time needed for surgery especially for complex procedures – an added benefit being that patients will require less time under anaesthetic. ‘It allows less soft tissue disruption and the use of more minimal access techniques meaning faster rehabilitation for our patients.’","The £500,000 Medtronic O-Arm scanner delivers high-quality 3D images .

A $5,000 reward is being offered to track down the person responsible for injuring Henry the Boston terrier so badly that he had to be put down. A passerby found Henry limping badly and covered in burns in the El Monte area of Los Angeles and took him to a local animal shelter. The shelter passed Henry on to a specialised Boston Terrier rescue organisation, Boston Buddies, in the hope of saving him. Chemical burns: Henry the Boston terrier was so badly disfigured that only pictures of his face can be shown . When Charla Hall from Boston Buddies took him to the vet, he whimpered for the entire hour on the way from the pain of his burns. She could only soothe him by stroking the small patch of his head that was not burned. The vet said that some type of caustic chemical that had been poured on him. In addition to the damage to his skin, one of Henry’s eyes was ulcerated – perhaps another result of chemical torture. The only thing the vet could do was to put Henry down. Justice for Henry: The public were so outraged by the cruelty Henry suffered that they raised money for a reward . Henry's injuries were so horrific that only pictures of his face can be shown as the rest of his body is too disfigured. Charla Hall, who was in tears, told local TV station KTLA: 'What I saw was the hardest thing that I have ever had to deal with . She could not believe that someone could be so cruel to such a 'small and kind' animal. When Boston Buddies posted Henry’s story online, the public were so outraged that they offered donations for a reward to catch the person responsible. Hall told KTLA: 'If that person could do this to an innocent dog, it’s only a matter of time before they progress to people. 'We’d like to do everything we can to get them off the streets.'

A mother who was told she could not hug or touch her children because her cancer treatment meant she was radioactive has finally been given the all-clear. Emma Day, 27, was given strict instructions to stay two metres from anyone after she underwent a pioneering programme of treatment for thyroid cancer which left her emitting harmful rays. She was initially hospitalised in an isolation ward but doctors allowed her to return home - as long as she did not go near her six-year-old daughter or one-year-old twins. Emma Day (pictured with husband, Jon, and their three children) was unable to cuddle her children after cancer treatment made her radioactive . But now, after three long weeks, the mother from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, has been given the all-clear meaning she can finally kiss and cuddle her children once more. Mrs Day said: ‘It was amazing just being able to hug my children again. The week before had been really difficult. ‘I was really surprised when the doctors told me I had the all-clear, and I certainly didn't expect it to happen that quickly. ‘They were a bit surprised themselves. ‘I was really struggling with not being able to be near my children, and it was really emotional especially when the children were crying and I couldn't go to them.’ Mrs Day said she rushed home to cuddle her children as soon as doctors told her it was safe. For three weeks she had to stay at least two metres from the children meaning she had to watch from a distance while her husband, Jon, played with them . Mrs Day had to take high doses of iodine as part of her treatment for thyroid cancer. This was the second time she had fought cancer as she suffered from leukaemia as a child . ‘People sometimes take their children for granted and just to be able to hug them again was a perfect moment,’ she added. Mrs Day was first diagnosed with thyroid cancer in January this year after seeing a doctor for a lump in her throat. It is the second time she has battled cancer, after defeating leukaemia as a child. She first thought the lump in her throat was a swollen gland but doctors soon realised the six-centimetre growth was cancerous after an operation to remove half of it. Mrs Day (pictured with her husband, Jon, and their eldest daughter on the couple's wedding day) was diagnosed with thyroid cancer after finding a lump in her throat . As part of her treatment, Mrs Day underwent a pioneering programme which saw her placed in an isolation unit at Cheltenham General Hospital. For her particular type of cancer, some patients receive radioactive iodine treatment – a form of internal radiotherapy. The treatment involves a radioactive form of the element called iodine 131, administered as a drink or capsule, which circulates throughout the body in the bloodstream. Thyroid cancer cells pick up the iodine wherever they are in the body, and the radiation kills them. Other cells are left unaffected, because only thyroid cells take up the iodine. She had now been given the all-clear and can cuddle her children again - she will have another scan in six months time to ensure that the cancer has not returned . She was initially so radioactive anything she touched inside had to be thrown away and she had only a phone for company. She was allowed home three weeks ago, but was forced to watch from a distance as her children played and were looked after by her family. Throughout her treatment Mrs Day kept a blog and more than 80 bloggers rallied around her, posting messages of support. She said: ‘My blog became therapy for me because I could share how I was feeling. They have been there to support me and to cheer me up, and I am very thankful for that. ‘I have only met a few of them, but they were really encouraging during those days.’ Mrs Day will have a scan in six months to see whether she will have to undergo the treatment again, but for now she is determined to make the most of being close to her family.

Warning: Home Secretary Theresa May says migrants are placing an 'unacceptable burden' on schools, hospitals and benefits system . Migrants are travelling from across the EU to ‘beg and steal’ on the streets of Britain, Theresa May will warn Europe’s leaders. The Home Secretary will demand action to end abuse of the EU’s free movement directive by people who have no intention of finding work. At a meeting of European home affairs ministers in Luxembourg on Friday, she will highlight how gangs of beggars are setting up camps in London to launch raids on the unsuspecting public. She will also outline a case in which Romanian fraudsters fleeced the British taxpayer of almost £3million. Home Office officials say it is a huge achievement for the issue to even be discussed. EU leaders have been reluctant to even contemplate any changes to the rules – it has taken three years for Mrs May to get it on the agenda, . According to Whitehall sources, the Home Secretary will say that abuse of free movement rights by some EU migrants is placing an ‘unacceptable burden on our schools, our hospitals, our social security systems and our local communities’. She will stress that it is unacceptable that some EU nationals are able to come to countries such as the UK with no intention of working, but simply to access our state benefits and take advantage of our public services. Mrs May will then tell the rest of Europe that it cannot be right that national governments are unable to act to stop this abuse. In a significant move, she will present the council with examples of how EU nationals are fleecing the British taxpayer. They will include the case of a Lavinia Olmazu, who helped more than 170 Romanians illegally claim £2.9m in benefits has been jailed for two years and three months. Olmazu, a leading campaigner for the rights of Roma gypsies, helped mastermind the scam involving 172 Romanians. After gaining access to the Romanians through her outreach work with Haringey and Waltham Forest councils and the Big Issue charity, she set up companies with her boyfriend to help facilitate widescale fraudulent benefit claims. Problem: Police from Westminster regularly target Romanian beggars and rough sleepers in London . Mrs May will also say there is a ‘recurring problem’ with groups of EU nationals who set up camps in public areas in London, and beg and steal from tourists. She will say they arrive under the free movement rules but have no intention of working, studying or setting up a business. In 2012, over 70 per cent of individuals arrested for begging in one London borough – Westminster – were EU citizens. Police have warned of aggressive begging by people from some Eastern European states, including Romania. In April Mrs May secured the backing of Germany, Holland and Austria to campaign for tighter restrictions on migrants’ access to hand-outs and other State services. The four countries wrote to the President of the EU  arguing that the free movement directive – a founding principle of the EU – must not be ‘unconditional’. They want to make to persuade the Eurocrats to make it harder for citizens of other member states to access benefits within days or weeks of arriving in another member state. The letter has led to the discussion at Friday’s meeting. Britain has long been seeking changes to the rules on entitlement to welfare. However, the chances of success were limited while the UK government was a lone voice in Brussels. Camps: Britain faces a 'recurring problem' with groups of EU nationals who travel to London to beg and steal from tourists, Mrs May warns . The fact that Germany, in particular, has joined the campaign will place huge new pressure on the other member states to agree to tighten the rules. Speaking last night, Mrs May said: ‘We are already taking tough action in this country to stamp out the abuse of free movement, to protect our benefits system and public services. ‘We will not allow this country to be a soft touch but this isn't just a UK problem - it will take the joint efforts of all our EU partners to tackle it.’ It comes at a time of heightened tensions between the British government and the EU. Last week, the European Commission announced it was taking Britain to court for insisting migrants pass a ‘right to reside’ test before they can access some State handouts. Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, is planning to defy the EC and make existing restrictions even tougher.","Home Secretary warns of 'unacceptable burden' on schools and hospitals .

Drugs used for treating Alzheimer's disease may protect against heart attacks and death, claim researchers. Scientists found medication such as Aricept was linked to a 38 per cent cut in the risk of heart attack, compared with people suffering dementia not taking it. Those on the highest doses of drugs called cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs), which are used to treat mild to moderate disease, got the greatest reduction in risk. Research claims: Drugs used for treating Alzheimer's disease may protect against heart attacks and death . The drugs are thought to have a beneficial effect on the vagus nerve, which controls how fast the heart beats, and may be anti-inflammatory. Professor Peter Nordström, of Umeå University in Umeå, Sweden, who led the study, which included the drugs donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine and galantamine. He said: 'If you translate these reductions in risk into absolute figures, it means that for every 100,000 people with Alzheimer's disease, there would be 180 fewer heart attacks - 295 as opposed to 475 - and 1125 fewer deaths from all causes - 2000 versus 3125 - every year among those taking ChEIs compared to those not using them. 'As far as we know, this is the first time that the use of ChEIs has been linked to a reduced risk of heart attacks and deaths from cardiovascular disease in general or from any cause.' In the study over 7,000 people with Alzheimer's were monitored from May 2007 to December 2010, says a report in the European Heart Journal. Those who were on ChEIs had a 36 per cent reduced risk of death from any cause, a 38 per cent reduced risk of a heart attack and a 26 per cent reduced risk of death from cardiovascular causes such as stroke compared to people not taking ChEIs. Patients taking the highest recommended . doses of ChEIs had the lowest risk of heart attack or death: 65 per cent . and 46 per cent lower compared with those who had never used ChEIs. In hospital: Those on ChEIs had a 36 per cent reduced risk of death from any cause and a 26 per cent reduced risk of death from cardiovascular causes compared to people not taking ChEIs . The researchers also checked whether the cut in risk applied to other drug treatments for dementia such as memantine, which works in a different way, but it made no difference to the risk of heart attack or death from any cause. Prof Nordström said: 'We cannot say that ChEI use is causing the reduction in risk, only that it is associated with a reduction. 'As far as we know, this is the first time that the use of ChEIs has been linked to a reduced risk of heart attacks and deaths from cardiovascular disease in general or from any cause' Professor Peter Nordström, Umeå University . 'However, the strengths of the associations make them very interesting from the clinical point of view, although no clinical recommendations should be made on the basis of the results from our study. 'It would be of great value if a meta-analysis of previous, randomised controlled trials could be performed, as this might produce answers on which clinical recommendations could be based.' As the findings came from a nationwide group of patients, Prof Nordström said they were likely to apply to other countries. Maureen Talbot, Senior Cardiac Nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: 'The link between this particular Alzheimer's medication and heart health is interesting, but by no means definitive. 'We don't know if the medication itself caused the drop in heart attack risk or if another factor was involved. This is the first study to link an Alzheimer's medication to reduced risk of heart attacks so we need to see much more research before we can draw any conclusions. 'In the meantime, there's lots you can do to protect your heart without a prescription. Quitting smoking, eating a balanced diet and getting enough exercise are all great ways to keep your heart healthy. If you're over 40 you can ask your GP for a free health check.'","Scientists found Aricept was linked to 38% cut in the risk of heart attack .

The youngest patient in Britain to be fitted with a mini-defibrillator has been given a life-saving heart transplant. Fifteen-month-old Carina Marcangelo suffered from . cardiomyopathy, a disease that damages the heart. She was just nine-months-old when she was fitted with an ICD . (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator), which gives the heart a shock if it goes into a dangerous rhythm. Fifteen-month-old Carina Marcangelo underwent a heart transplant at Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital in April. She is pictured with parents Nicole and Darren, and sister Emily . Cardiomyopathy, a disease that damages the heart muscle, meant her left ventricle had a thickened wall, which stopped it working as well as it should. Carina was admitted to the Royal Brompton Hospital in October 2012 after she collapsed at home. After a month in hospital, she was placed on the waiting list for a heart transplant and became the youngest patient in the country to be fitted with an ICD. Following an agonising wait, in early April the Marcangelo family received the call they had been waiting desperately for, and Carina was taken to Great Ormond Street Hospital for the transplant. Before the call, the family said they had prepared themselves for the worst. Carina became the youngest heart implant patient in the UK after cardiomyopathy, a disease that damages the heart muscle, meant her left ventricle had a thickened wall, which stopped it working as well as it should . Carina's father, Darren Marcangelo, 40, said: ‘The doctors had told us they didn't know what to do next for Carina. ‘It is a horrendous position to be in, but we were never going to give up on her.’ During her nine-hour transplant surgery, Carina almost bled to death and doctors had to act quickly to stop the bleeding. As a result, she ended up with a large blood clot behind her knee. She was diagnosed after being admitted to the Royal Brompton Hospital in October 2012 when she collapsed at home. She was put on the heart transplant list after a month in hospital . Her parents faced an agonising wait to discover whether a heart would come up in time to save her life but they prepared themselves for the worst as she became sicker and sicker . Mr Marcangelo said: ‘They initially said there was no hope for her leg after the transplant. It was horrendous. We didn't cope very well with it.’ His wife, Nicole, 36, said: ‘It just felt like one thing after another and we thought “what's next?""’ The family said they were ‘so lucky’ a plastic surgeon came up and looked at Carina's leg and suggested a procedure worth trying. The procedures to save her leg were successful and Carina now has blood thinning injections to her leg twice a day to help the recovery process. In April she underwent a nine-hour operation to give her a new heart but she nearly bled to death during the surgery and developed a blood clot in her leg which nearly resulted in it having to be amputated . After a month-and-a-half at Great Ormond Street Hospital, the family were delighted to be able to return home last month. However, their joy was short-lived as Carina was taken to Kingston Hospital at the end of May after suffering difficulty breathing and a high temperature. Mrs Marcangelo said: ‘They said it would be a short stay while she had oxygen, but it was quite strange being back at Kingston, as that is where it all began. Kingston Hospital saved her life the first day she collapsed. ‘The day we left Great Ormond Street, a consultant said to us they were amazed Kingston had kept her alive because of her complex condition. Kingston is a fantastic hospital and has a brilliant team.’ Doctors managed to save her leg but she now has to have twice-daily blood thinning injections to help her recovery . A few days after she returned home, Carina suffered breathing difficulties and developed a high fever which meant she had to be readmitted to hospital but she has now returned home again . After being given antibiotics for a chest infection, Carina returned home to her family. Mrs Marcangelo said: ‘Apart from the hiccup, life has been so amazing since we have been home but it is exhausting.’ After spending nearly half of her life in hospital, Carina is now enjoying little things such as seeing the clouds in the sky, feeling the wind in her face and watching the family's pet cat with fascination. Mrs Marcangelo: ‘The first time we went out of the hospital after her transplant, it was like the first time she had seen the world. Carina with her father Darren, sister Emily, and mother Nicole. The family are urging people to sign up to the organ donation register so that others, like Carina, are given a chance at life . ‘Now we are home, we won't take anything for granted, even doing normal things such as doing the housework and food shopping.’ The family are very hopeful for Carina's new heart, with a recent biopsy showing no signs of rejection. Mrs Marcangelo said: ‘If we could say anything it would be how much the transplant means to us as a family. It is amazing that we can come home and be a family again. ‘It would not have happened without that family who donated their child's organs.’ The family said they want to do their best to help raise further awareness about organ donation and will attend a fun run for Great Ormond Street Hospital at Battersea Park on June 9. Mrs Marcangelo said: ‘It is such a sensitive subject and is very taboo. We are not saying you should sign your child up, we are saying just think about it. It is just to make sure people think about it and talk about it as a family.’","Carina Marcangelo had cardiomyopathy, a disease that damages the heart .

Catherine Kieu, pictured, is accused of drugging her husband, tying him up, and cutting off his penis with a knife . A man has told a court how his wife drugged him before cutting off his penis with one slash of a knife and throwing it in the garbage disposal. The 60-year-old man, whose penis was too mangled to reattached but who had surgery so he could urinate, told the court: 'She murdered me that night.' His ex-wife, Catherine Kieu, 50, is accused of severing his penis because she was angry that he had started seeing a former lover and wanted a divorce. On the first day of the trial yesterday, deputy district attorney John Christl said that Kieu had bugged her house in a bid to catch her husband cheating on her with an old flame. The bugs found nothing, although they did record the attack Kieu is said to have committed on her 60-year-old husband. Mr Christl said Kieu laced her husband's tofu soup with insomnia drug Zolpidem on the evening of July 11, 2011, while they were both at their marital home in Garden Grove, southeast of Los Angeles. He said audio footage picked up the husband complimenting her on the soup, before going to bed, early, at 8.10pm. Kieu is then alleged to have waited until he was asleep before tying him to the bed and cutting off his penis with a ten-inch kitchen knife. The husband,who is known only by his first name in court, said he remembered waking up tied to the bed. Mr Christl said: 'When he woke, she told him ""You deserve it"" three times, and then slices off his penis with one motion of the knife', reported news.com.au. 'She then walks into the kitchen, takes the severed penis, and puts it into the garbage disposal.'  He told the court that after she put the penis in the garbage disposal, she then turned it on, before calling 911. 'All of a sudden I felt a very sharp pain,' the husband said. 'I will never have a sex life again.' Catherine Kieu sits next to her attorney,deputy public defender Frank Bittar, before opening statements yesterday . He added: 'My mental state is improving, but it may never be what it was before,' he said. In his opening statement, Deputy Public Defender Frank Bittar told jurors that Kieu’s traumatic childhood in war-torn Vietnam caused mental illness that should prevent her from conviction on the charges of aggravated mayhem and torture. He also said the husband was over-sexual, using erectile dysfunction drugs and forcing his wife into sexual positions that hurt. 'You're going to learn that in Catherine's mind, she severed his penis because she wanted him to stop hurting her with his penis,' he added. Mr Bittar said Kieu met the victim at a gym, and after they married he subjected her to sexual and verbal abuse. Kieu was held at Orange County Jail after the attack on her husband in the summer of 2011 . He said: 'In Catherine's mind, she severed his penis because she wanted him to stop hurting her with his penis.' Mr Bittar said the husband filed for divorce while they continued to live together in his Garden Grove home. Prosecutors played audio in court that was captured by a voice-activated recorder Kieu had hidden in the bedroom, according to Christl. Kieu is heard yelling 'You deserve it' three times before the attack on the recording.

Lydia Spilner, 100, was admitted to Leicester Royal Infirmary in January 2012 after she developed a chest infection . A woman aged 100 died of dehydration on a hospital ward after being taken off her drip. A ‘catastrophic error’ caused the death of great-grandmother Lydia Spilner despite frantic efforts by her family to get her treated. Her daughter Nora Spilner complained to nurses regularly during her mother’s four-week stay at Leicester Royal Infirmary. But she was unable to get her mother put back on a drip for ten days, even though her condition was clearly deteriorating. University Hospitals of Leicestershire NHS Trust has now admitted that Mrs Spilner died due to renal failure caused by dehydration and paid her family an undisclosed out-of-court settlement. During Mrs Spilner’s stay in hospital her daughter noticed there was no water jug next to her mother’s bed – and was told it had broken and there were no spares. On several occasions she found her mother lying in urine-soaked sheets, and with her hair caked in porridge. ‘The nurse was laughing as she told me my mother had fallen asleep in her breakfast,’ Mrs Spilner’s daughter said. She said her ‘fiercely independent’ mother, a widow since 1970, was admitted to hospital in January last year with a suspected chest infection and dehydration caused by medication prescribed by GPs. Her daughter, Nora (pictured by Mrs Spilner's grave with her grand-daughter, Amy), says that her mother was left without water and that it took ten days for her to be hooked up to an IV drip despite the fact she was severely dehydrated . ‘The A&E doctors explained that . her confused speech was a clear sign she had become dehydrated,’ said . Nora Spilner, of Tilton on the Hill, Leicestershire. ‘They put her on a . drip and within two hours she was back to her normal self. ‘I wish I had taken her back home . then, because I firmly believe I could have taken better care of her and . she would still be alive today. 'Instead I put my trust in the . hospital and allowed her to be moved to an elderly care ward, thinking . she would be in good hands and they would be able to sort out her chest . infection.’ Mrs Spilner was transferred to ward 31 of Leicester Royal Infirmary, where her daughter soon became alarmed. Nora also claims that Mrs Spilner (pictured celebrating her 100th birthday) was left lying in urine-soaked sheets and that nurses thought it was funny that her hair was caked in food . Nora also says that she was forced to alert nurses after finding her mother had slipped and fallen under her hospital bed and that on a number of occasions she found Mrs Spilner very hungry . She said: ‘My mum’s skin was becoming . dry and cracked and it was clear to me she was very dehydrated. I . pleaded with the doctors to put her back on a drip but it took ten days . for them to take action. 'The nurse was laughing as she told me my mother had fallen asleep in her breakfast' Nora Spilner . ‘Even then the drip didn’t work . properly. They first tried to administer it through her leg, which . swelled up like a balloon, and later they tried her hand and arm but the . drip either stopped working properly or made her arm swell.’ The great-grandmother – who had celebrated her 100th birthday on September 22, 2011 – died on February 22, 2012. Cause of death was confirmed as renal failure, combined with poor blood flow to her lower limbs. ‘Her condition was allowed to . deteriorate with very little thought for her dignity,’ said her . daughter. ‘The way she was looked after was appalling. The nurses didn’t . show her an ounce of compassion.’ The hospital has admitted that basic care failures led to Mrs Spilner's . death. Nora claims that her mother was subjected to a catalogue of . failures in basic care . Mrs Spilner died at the Leicester Royal Infirmary in February 2012 after suffering kidney failure as a result of dehydration. The hospital has accepted that its failures contributed to her death . Sue Mason, divisional head of nursing . at Leicester Hospitals, said: ‘It’s clear that our failure to give Mrs . Spilner intravenous fluids was a catastrophic error for which we have . apologised. 'We know that saying sorry won’t bring her back but we at least want her family to know that we will not avoid our responsibility, we are truly sorry' Sue Mason, Leicester Hospitals . 'We know that saying sorry won’t bring . her back but we at least want her family to know that we will not avoid . our responsibility, we are truly sorry. ‘As regards the equally important . issue of the compassion shown to Mrs Spilner, since this happened in . 2012, we have changed the nurse leadership on this ward, increased . staffing levels and introduced hourly ward rounds.’ Robert Rose, a medical lawyer with .

Actress Daryl Hannah was arrested in northeast Texas on Thursday, along with a 78-year-old landowner as the pair protested an oil pipeline designed to bring crude from Canada to the Gulf Coast. The Kill Bill star and landowner Eleanor Fairchild . were standing in front of heavy equipment in an attempt to halt . construction of the Keystone XL pipeline on Fairchild's farm in . Winnsboro, a town about 100 miles east of Dallas. They were arrested for . criminal trespassing and taken to the Wood County Jail, said Paul Bassis, Hannah's manager. Protest: Hollywood star and activist Daryl Hannah was arrested by Wood County authorities for protesting the Keystone XL pipeline in Texas . 'They've arrested Daryl Hannah and a rural Texas great-grandmother,' he added. Hannah has long opposed TransCanada's construction of the $7 billion pipeline, which is designed to transport heavy tar-sands crude oil from Alberta, Canada, to Texas' Gulf Coast refineries. 'It is unfortunate Ms. Hannah and other out-of-state activists have chosen to break the law by illegally trespassing on private property,' David Dodson, a spokesman for TransCanada, said in an email. He also said protesters were 'putting their own safety and the safety of others at risk'. Bassis said he spoke to the actress on Thursday evening and that there was 'a strong indication' that both women would be kept overnight at the local jail. 'The streets of Winnsboro will be much safer tonight now that they've gotten that 78-year-old great grandmother off the streets,' Bassis said. Hannah - who has starred in dozens of . movies, including Kill Bill, Thelma and Louise and Splash - also was . arrested in August 2011 while protesting the pipeline in Washington. She . was one of several hundred prominent scientists and activists arrested . that month. Making waves: Hannah, pictured in the 1984 movie Splash, has been arrested while protesting the Keystone pipeline outside of Dallas . In character: Hannah stars as Elle Driver in the movie Kill Bill, directed by Quentin Tarantino . They argue the pipeline would be . unsafe because it would be carrying heavy, acidic crude oil that could . more easily corrode a metal pipe, which would lead to a spill. They also . say refining the oil would further contaminate the air in a region that . has long struggled with pollution. TransCanada . says its pipeline would be the safest ever built, and that the crude is . no dirtier than oil currently arriving from Venezuela or parts of . California. The issue . became politically charged when congressional Republicans gave President . Barack Obama 60 days to decide whether TransCanada should be granted . the necessary permit for the pipeline to cross an international border . before snaking its way 1,700 miles south to the Texas coast. Obama, saying his administration did not . have enough time to study the potential environmental impacts, denied . the permit in January. Arrested: Landowner Eleanor Fairchild, 78, was also brought to jail with Hannah . However, he encouraged TransCanada to reroute the northern portion of the pipeline to avoid an environmentally sensitive area of Nebraska. He also promised to expedite permitting of a southern portion of the pipeline from Cushing, Okla., to the Gulf Coast to relieve a bottleneck at the Cushing refinery. TransCanada began construction of that portion of the pipeline this summer after receiving the necessary permits. Some Texas landowners, joined by activists from outside the state, have tried through various protests to stop or slow down construction. Taking a stand: Daryl Hannah was previously arrested at a protest against Keystone outside the White House in Washington last August .

Data from more than 3,500 STI consultations across Europe shows that Swedes seek the most advice for symptoms of STIs, closely followed by Germans and Britons . Sweden has been named the sexually transmitted infection capital of Europe. Data from more than 3,500 STI consultations across Europe shows that Swedes seek the most advice for symptoms of STIs. Germans were found to be the second most likely to require treatment for an STI and they are followed closely by Britons, who are the third most likely to catch an infection. The French, Poles, Spanish and Italians were also in the top ten most likely to suffer from an STI, according to data collected by an online health clinic. Across Europe, chlamydia was revealed to be the most common STI. The data, from online clinic HealthExpress, also shows that there has been a significant rise in the number of reported cases of STIs across Europe in the last decade - Sweden experienced a 38 per cent rise in chlamydia and gonorrhoea cases in recent years. However, experts believe that there may be other reasons why Swedes are the most likely to seek treatment for STIs – in Sweden it is a legal requirement that people tell any past sexual partners of their diagnosis if they seek treatment. Dr Hilary Jones, medical adviser at HealthExpress said: ‘With the stringent rules in their country, it may be we are seeing a knock on effect of Swedish people seeking treatment for STIs after they have been told by a partner they are infected. ‘Although some may view the country’s rules as “draconian”, having legislation which protects people from infection could help other countries within the EU dent the rising STI figures. 1. Sweden . 2. Germany . 3. United Kingdom . 4. Poland . 5. France . 6. Spain . 7. Italy . 8. Denmark . 9. Switzerland . 10. Austria . ‘There are a number of STIs that can be caught from either unprotected sex or close contact. Some are treatable, such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea. ‘However, those caused by viral infections such as genital herpes and genital warts may be difficult to treat or be incurable, and you could suffer symptoms throughout your life. ‘Curable, or incurable, all STIs pose a risk to your health and can cause permanent damage or infertility if left untreated, so it is imperative you seek advice if you have been put at risk of infection.’ The research comes after HealthExpress revealed that Birmingham is the STI capital of the UK. Following Birmingham were the residents of East London, with Glasgow coming in a close third. In . all locations, chlamydia was the most commonly treated STI in the UK, . with gonorrhoea and genital warts being the second and third. There has been a significant rise in . the number of reported cases of STIs in the UK since the 1990s, with the . number of reported cases of chlamydia tripling between 1995 and 2005. The most affected age group used to be 16 to 24-year-olds, but the online clinic found that the average age has risen to 34.9. Data also revealed chlamydia (pictured) is the most common STI in Europe and the number of cases is rising rapidly. The most affected age group used to be 16 to 24-year-olds, but the average age has risen to 34.9 . Cases of 'untreatable gonorrhoea' have also soared by 25 per cent in a year and experts are warning the disease is becoming more resistant to treatment. More than 20,000 new cases of the STI were diagnosed in 2011. The spike has led to the launch of a new campaign to tackle the growing threat in England and Wales in a bid to reverse the trend. Health experts are hoping the first Gonorrhoea Resistance Action Plan will increase awareness of the disease, which is the second most common bacterial STI in England. The plan, established by the Health Protection Agency, will monitor the global problem of increasing resistance over the last 10 years.","In Europe, Swedes are the most likely to seek treatment for an STI .

Tragic: Mother-of-two Shirely Pooley died of pneumonia aged just 51 three days after this picture was taken on Christmas Day 2010 . The photo shows a smiling Shirley Pooley, her face radiating health and happiness. Taken on Christmas Day 2010, there is no clue that less than three days later she would be dead from pneumonia, aged just 51. The fact that her untimely death left behind a loving husband, Gary, and their two teenage children, Megan, then 19, and Gareth, 14, is tragedy enough. The thought that she could still be alive today had she not been failed by a shambolic out-of-hours doctor service adds another layer of anger and regret to her grieving family’s terrible loss. As Gary, 57, explains, his wife’s medical history was a complicated one. Shirley suffered from asthma and the incurable auto-immune condition Lupus, which is caused by problems with the body’s natural defence system against illness and infection. It manifested itself in symptoms such as fatigue, joint swelling and skin rashes. With the help of medication, Shirley managed her health problems well most of the time, but after a happy family Christmas at home in Needham Market, Suffolk, she fell extremely ill with a cold on Boxing Day. ‘Her breathing wasn’t good and she felt lethargic,’ says Gary. ‘But Shirley was a no-fuss type. She always thought that, compared to others, her problems were minuscule.’ However, by lunchtime the next day Shirley had developed gastric problems and was so weak she had to be lifted onto the lavatory. Concerned by his wife’s deteriorating condition, Gary telephoned the family’s GP surgery shortly after 2.30pm. Had the GPs — who knew Shirley well — been on call, they would have been aware of her underlying health problems and of her need for prompt attention. Instead, Gary’s call was redirected to an out-of-hours helpline managed by Harmoni, Britain’s largest urgent care provider. It was 3.35pm when a doctor rang him back. ‘He was clearly foreign and I struggled to understand him,’ recalls Gary. ‘He offered us an appointment at an out-of-hours surgery, but I explained that my wife was too ill to be moved; that she was struggling to breathe. ‘Alarm bells should have been ringing, but the doctor just said: “We’ll get someone to you when we can.” He was no more specific than that.’ More than six hours after Gary’s first conversation with a Harmoni operator, a doctor had still not arrived. Ringing again, Gary was fobbed off with excuses. ‘I got the impression Shirley had fallen completely off the radar,’ he says. ‘I had told the doctor earlier that she appeared to be struggling to breathe, but when I called back it seemed as if I was starting from scratch.’ By now, Shirley was rapidly deteriorating. ‘Her lips had gone blue and her speech was slurred and incoherent,’ says Gary. Aware that his wife could wait no longer, he called 999. A first responder arrived almost immediately, and the ambulance just minutes later. ‘The paramedics were brilliant,’ recalls Gary. ‘They put an oxygen mask straight on her and I held her hand as they rushed her into resuscitation.’ He stalls, momentarily choked by the recollection. His daughter Megan, now aged 21, continues quietly: ‘It was the worst nightmare you can possibly imagine. It wasn’t my Mum there at all.’ Grief: Shirley's husband Gary, centre, with their two children, Megan, now 21, and Gareth, now 17, who were with her during her rapid deterioration which began with a cold on Boxing Day . Despite medics’ best attempts to save her, Shirley suffered two cardiac arrests. Her death certificate records she died of pneumonia at Ipswich Hospital, shortly after 4am on December 28. ‘She was so very ill and I could not bear to see her suffering,’ says Gary, and again he weeps. ‘I said: “You have to let her go.” ’ Megan adds: ‘I have so much admiration for Dad. He did his very best.’ Megan is now an undergraduate at Anglia Ruskin College in Cambridge, while Gareth, 17, hopes to join the Navy or the police. His parents, both dedicated to public service, set him an admirable example. Shirley, a police officer for 17 years before health problems forced her to retire, had been a schools liaison officer. ‘She knew everyone,’ smiles Megan. ‘Everyone respected her — even the little terrors in the schools she visited. At her funeral, there was a sea of people paying their respects.’ Gary and Shirley with their children on their wedding day in 2007: Shirley, a police officer for 17 years before health problems forced her to retire, had been a well-like and respected schools liaison officer . Shirley’s health problems had not constrained her. She still played netball and was an avid supporter of Ipswich Town FC. She and Gary, a retired police traffic officer who now works as a civilian driving instructor for Suffolk Constabulary, were planning their retirement when her life was so cruelly snatched away. The caravan they had bought to go touring in now stands idle on the drive of the home that was once the hub of a happy family life. ‘What do you miss about Shirley?’ I ask, and Gary reflects for a second. ‘Everything,’ he says, simply. ‘She was our linchpin. She held us all together.’ An inquest into Shirley’s death this April heard about irregularities in the way Harmoni dealt with her case. Gary’s conversation with the doctor was not recorded, although his other conversations with call centre operators were. He recalls telling the doctor that Shirley was ‘struggling to breathe’ but the doctor’s notes from the call referred to her having ‘no difficulty breathing’. Gary believes this discrepancy, and problems with Harmoni’s internal communications, led to his wife’s case being wrongly downgraded from urgent to routine. 'She was our linchpin': Shirley pictured in 2003 with Megan, then 11, and Gareth, then six. An inquest into Shirley¿s death this April heard about irregularities in the way Harmoni dealt with her case . Suffolk Coroner Dr Peter Dean recorded a narrative verdict that Mrs Pooley died from lobial pneumonia — a treatable infection — to which her pre-existing Lupus contributed. He said: ‘There were significant delays in providing medical assistance for a variety of reasons but whether these adversely affected the outcome could not be established on the evidence.’ A spokesman for Harmoni simply offered the same impersonal response their press office appears to issue in such instances: ‘We would like to express our deepest sympathy to those families who lose a loved one in any circumstances. ‘Sadly, any large health care provider like Harmoni will be involved over time in the care of some patients who then die, making it essential to understand the causes of death and any lessons for the service. ‘The coroner concluded it was not possible to know whether the outcome would have been different if Mrs Pooley had been seen earlier. The evidence heard at the inquest demonstrated that the service has appropriate policies and procedures to recruit clinicians and audit their performance.’ Gary, meanwhile, is left with a legacy of grief and regret. ‘I will always ask myself: “Had the doctor come, would the outcome have been different?” We’ll never know the answer — but we do know she would at least have had a fighting chance.’ ■ Have you had a problem with out-of-hours care?

The Royal Marines' much-feared Mud Run is the toughest part of the 32-week training course said to turn 'civilians into commandos', and looking at these astonishing photographs, you can see why even the strongest recruits dread it. Exhausted, demoralised, and covered in foul-smelling sludge from head to toe, these Royal Marine recruits hope one day to wear the coveted Green Beret marking them out as the elite of Britain's fighting forces. Scroll down for video . Crawling through the mire of the Exe estuary in Devon, these recruits are taking part in the notorious Mud Run - the most feared part of the Royal Marines' training course . Drenched in mud from head to toe, the recruits' boiler suits offer little protection from the foul-smelling mud left by the retreating tide in the Exe estuary . The Commandos-in-waiting have to call upon reserves of strength they didn't know they had, both mental and physical, to survive the notorious exercise . As these pictures, taken on Wednesday, show, the men need to call upon reserves - both mental and physical - that they didn't know they had simply to get through the gruelling ordeal. Captain Ben Chappell, who oversees physical training at the Royal Marines Commmando Training Centre in Lympstone, Devon, said: 'The Mud Run is about instilling a Royal Marines state of mind. 'The recruits spend up to 45 minutes in the mud that is so thick they can barely run, doing exercises and games, and it is so difficult that getting through it really builds team spirit. 'We are not just looking for physical strength but mental resilience as well, and the team cohesion that comes from getting through the hardship together - this strength and cohesion forms part of the Royal Marines' DNA.'

Their boilersuits offer little protection from the stinking slime as their superiors bawl at them to do press ups, and crawl on hands and knees through the mire left by the receding tide in the Exe estuary beside their training base in Lympstone, Devon.

Gruelling: The Mud Runs are the most feared part of the 32-week training course at the Lympstone military base on the mouth of the Exe estuary .

Two-year-old twin sisters are not able to enjoy playing in the park or to go on holiday because the excitement could kill them. Darcie and Evie Chapman, from Warrington, Cheshire, are the only twins in the UK to have a severe form of epilepsy called Dravet Syndrome. Seizures can lead to SUDEP (sudden . unexplained death in epilepsy patients) and the condition leads to . delays in development, feeding problems, sleep problems and . behavioural problems. Evie and Darcie Chapman have a severe form of epilepsy called Dravet Syndrome. It causes seizures, developmental delays, behavioural problems and feeding difficulties. They are pictured with parents, Mark and Natalie . Triggers for the seizures include excitement and extremes of temperature, meaning the girls must be strictly monitored. Mother Natalie, 36, said: 'The worst case scenario is that they . can have a fit and die in their beds, or that the oxygen supply to the . brain stops and leaves them brain damaged. 'At their worst we were calling out . ambulance after ambulance, but now they just have one or two fits a . month each. It's a big improvement. 'We try and keep things as normal as possible for them but it's hard, especially because there's two of them with Dravet. 'They see each other not walking and talking and think that it's normal. 'We have to be on high alert at all times and avoid their triggers, we have to constantly watch them - it's exhausting.' Evie and Darcie's seizures are triggered by excitement and extremes of temperature meaning that their parents constantly have to ensure that they are not getting over excited and that they are not too hot . The twins experienced their first seizures when they went on holiday to Spain at nine-months-old. They were diagnosed at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool when they got home . Darcie and Evie experienced their first seizure on a holiday to Spain when they were nine-months-old. Ms Chapman, a project manager for a building company, explained: 'Darcie had a fit first. It lasted about 20 minutes which is a long time.I just had no idea what was happening. We didn't even know the ambulance number.' The hospitals in Spain are not like . they are over here. They told us to get a taxi or drive there ourselves . as an ambulance could take over an hour to get to us. We had to carry her . in on foot. Dravet Syndrome is a rare and catastrophic form of epilepsy that begins in infancy. Children with Dravets tend to have normal development as babies but development starts to plateau when they are in their second year of life. Individuals with Dravet syndrome face a higher incidence of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy patients (SUDEP). They ofen also experience other conditions including developmental delays, sleeping difficulties, chronic infections and difficulty feeding. There is currently no cure and treatment options are limited - they mainly involve using anti-epilepsy drugs to treat the seizures. Little is known about the long term prognosis of people with Dravet Syndrome. 'We were in there for what felt like forever because no one could speak any English. 'The next day Evie had a staring . episode. Her eyes were rolling and we couldn't distract her by doing . anything. We didn't realise it at the time but that's another kind of . seizure. 'It was our first family holiday since . the girls had been born, and holidays abroad are a no-no now unless we . know there will be really good air conditioning.' When the family returned to England they visited their GP who assured them that some children have fits, but that . it could be a febrile convulsion that a lot of children have once in . their life. But the twins' fits became more and more frequent. Eventually they were referred to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool for tests on their brain activity. Ms Chapman said: 'Evie had a fit where she . looked to one side while we were at the hospital. As soon as the doctor . saw that he suspected it was Dravet Syndrome. 'They told us not to go home and look it up, but of course I did. 'I was absolutely devastated. To think . that you have normal children only to be told at nine-months-old that . they have a life limiting form of genetic illness that may cause them to . need care for the rest of their lives - it was horrendous. 'Tests confirmed our worst fears as we . tried to carry on as normally as we could whilst carrying the huge . burden that our girls were seriously ill.' Little is known about the long term prognosis of people with Dravet Syndrome but they tend to have normal development until they are two-years-old at which point their development plateaus . Now, the seizures are controlled by medication and the twins have far fewer fits. In the future, the children may be eligible for treatment using a special diet, known as a ketogenic diet. The ketogenic diet is an eating plan which forces the body to burn stored fat instead of glucose. This is achieved by making fat products the primary food that is consumed and by limiting the amount of carbohydrates eaten. It is not known exactly why this can prevent seizures but it is known that it works in some patients but not in others. They are at constant risk of SUDEP - sudden unexplained death in epilepsy patients - which is particularly common in people with this form of epilepsy . The twins' seizures are now successfully controlled with medication meaning that they each only have two or three fits each month . About a third of children who are on the diet become seizure-free, while another third improve but still have some seizures. The rest either do not respond or find it too difficult to stick to the diet. It is thought that following this diet also causes children to be more alert. Some people can be weaned off the diet after about two years. However, there can be side effects to the diet such as dehydration, constipation, kidney stones and gall stones. When they are older, the twins might be eligible for treatment using a special diet called a ketogenic diet - this is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet which forces the body to run off stored fat rather than glucose . It is not known why the diet reduces seizures, but in a third of children it stops them altogether and a further third see significant improvements in their symptoms . Ms Chapman said: 'The ketogenic diet has rave reviews and eliminates the need for medicine in some cases. 'Some users find that once their . children are off the medicine and on the diet they get their child back, . as in they could speak and walk. 'It's a very strict diet and the twins are not eating the best anyway. It would be too hard for them to stick to at this age.' Ms Chapman, and the twins' father Mark, 37, a civil servant, are hoping that one day . a cure will be found for Dravet Syndrome. The twins' parents, Mark and Natalie (pictured), hope that a cure will eventually be found for Dravet Syndrome. They are pictured with their sister, Ellie . Marie Baker, from the charity Dravet . Syndrome UK, said: 'Dravet Syndrome is one of the most catastrophic . epilepsies with higher rates of SUDEP than other forms of epilepsy. 'Seizures are very difficult to control . on conventional anti-epileptic medications and patients are prone to . status epilepticus, seizures that last longer than 15 minutes. The . longer a seizure lasts the higher the risks of the patient developing . brain damage. 'Alongside the seizures, which present . in the first year of life, patients with Dravet Syndrome also suffer . varying degrees of learning disability and many are diagnosed as being . on the autistic spectrum. Patients can also have mobility, communication . and eating difficulties. 'It is extremely unusual for twins to be . diagnosed with the condition and out of a membership of over 200 . families Darcie and Evie are our only twins.'","Darcie and Evie Chapman, from Cheshire, both have Dravet Syndrome .

A huge rise in expectant mothers who are 'too posh to push' is costing millions and putting pressure on the health service, it has been warned . Around one in four women in the UK now has their baby by caesarean – putting enormous pressure on the NHS, doctors claim. The rate has shot up to around 25 per cent in the last two decades, while in private hospitals it is around double that. In 1990 just 11 per cent of babies were delivered surgically. Recent figures show one in three Caesarean sections carried out in the UK is requested by the mother, compared to one in 20 in 1990, Dr Geraldine O'Sullivan, lead clinician for obstetric anaesthesia, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, claims. In private hospitals half of all Caesareans are carried out at the mother’s request. Out of the 700,000 births that take place in the UK every year, between 25 and 30 per cent are Caesarean sections, almost double the 15 per cent recommended by the World Health Organisation, she added. Each Caesarean costs the NHS £1,000 more than a regular delivery and a group of experts speaking at Euroanaesthesia, the annual congress of the European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA), claim that even a small reduction in the number of babies delivered using the procedure will result in a large reduction in costs and free up medical specialists to help with emergency procedures. Dr O'Sullivan voiced her concern for the added burden the increase is placing on an already stretched NHS. ‘The increased Caesarean section rate is putting anaesthesia, obstetric, and midwife teams under much greater strain at a time when there are increasingly reduced resources across healthcare systems,’ she said. There is a greater risk of death for women who have to undergo emergency Caesarean sections, which account for two thirds of all Caesarean sections in the UK. According to Dr O'Sullivan, reducing the number of planned Caesarean sections would allow doctors and nurses, especially anaesthesia specialists, to dedicate more of their time to women and their babies who are at risk of serious complications. She said: ‘Women who require an emergency Caesarean section during labour, but who have already had an epidural catheter sited during the labour, are in a good position to receive emergency anaesthesia for caesarean section, since stronger drugs can be injected down the epidural. ‘The use of these drugs, which are essentially stronger solutions of the drugs used for pain relief in labour, means that the mother can be ready for her emergency surgery within 10-12 minutes of the anaesthetist being informed that emergency delivery is required. Out of the 700,000 births that take place in the UK every year, between 25 and 30 per cent are Caesarean sections, almost double the 15 per cent recommended by the World Health Organisation . ‘Other countries in Europe are . experiencing similar issues to varying degrees and we need to ask why . this is happening,’ said Dr O'Sullivan. She explained: ‘Reasons could include better intra-partum fetal monitoring, fears of medico-legal claims, and, maternal demand. ‘Whatever the cause for the rise in the CS rate, it is likely that, in the near future, performance indicators will be devised for hospitals to help explain/evaluate that hospital's Caesarean section rate. ‘There is also a knock-on effect for future pregnancies, since once a woman has undergone one Caesarean section, she is then at greater risk of having an emergency CS in the next pregnancy, though in most cases she would demand another elective CS anyway. ‘Even for those women who have chosen vaginal birth following a previous caesarean section, around half will end up having a Caesarean section.’","One in four mothers having caesareans is putting pressure on NHS .

Merilyn Bartley, 46, said hours passed without a specialist checking on her five-month-old son Dominic, who had undergone major heart surgery . A mother has told of her despair as she begged for a doctor to save her dying baby at a hospital with a shortage of weekend staff. Merilyn Bartley, 46, said hours passed without a specialist checking on her five-month-old son Dominic, who had undergone major heart surgery. She described an ‘air of panic’ as nurses frantically searched for a doctor when his condition started to deteriorate. Prompt action would have saved the child’s life, an inquest heard. But crucial medical attention, equipment and test results were not available because he fell ill at the weekend. Dominic, who had had heart surgery at the Royal Brompton Hospital, was transferred to Barnet Hospital in North London to be monitored. He arrived on a Friday evening and the next day his condition started to deteriorate. His mother said: ‘I was very worried as we hadn’t seen doctors for a long time. 'There was an air of panic on the ward. I remember the nurses saying: “There are no doctors”.’ She said her family had been ‘really badly let down’. She added: ‘There was nobody to help. What do you do as a parent when your child is dying and there is nobody attending to him?’ Medical staff were meant to transfer Dominic back to the Royal Brompton for specialist care if he became unwell. However the on-call consultant failed to examine the baby, even after his condition suddenly worsened. On Saturday night Dominic stopped breathing and his face turned blue and mottled. He was rushed to theatre but suffered a cardiac arrest and died on Sunday morning, just 36 hours after being admitted. A specialist report eventually showed that his lungs had been overwhelmed by high levels of fluid. Dominic, who had had heart surgery at the Royal Brompton Hospital, was transferred to Barnet Hospital in North London to be monitored . On-call consultant Professor Anthony Costello said he would have ordered an urgent transfer back to the Royal Brompton if he had known about the problems. But he claimed he did not have access to an echocardiogram machine, which would have flagged up Dominic’s dangerously high blood pressure. He also revealed that he did not get the results of vital tests until after the baby’s death because it was the weekend. He arrived on a Friday evening and the next day his condition started to deteriorate . He told the inquest: ‘You wouldn’t get a report on a Saturday morning, it would have been the following week. Most hospitals at weekends don’t get consultant reports. 'You need a good echocardiogram service and someone who is using it a lot. You won’t get that on a weekend at Barnet. ‘You don’t want a child with any risk of complications in a district general hospital at a weekend.’ Expert witness Professor Robert Tulloh said Professor Costello’s decision not to examine the child was a ‘failure to provide basic medical care’, adding: ‘If he had taken action it would have prevented his death.’ Coroner Andrew Walker adjourned the inquest until later this month so he could hear further evidence. But he expressed concern that ‘crucial pieces of the jigsaw’ at the hospital were missing because of low weekend staffing and a lack of specialist services. He said: ‘You are missing a great deal of the facilities that you need at the weekend.’ The Daily Mail has highlighted fears that Britain’s out-of-hours health system is overstretched, with devastating consequences for patients needing care. The Barnet Hospital Trust said it would be inappropriate to comment until the inquest was completed.","Merilyn Bartley, 46, said family 'badly let down' after death of baby Dominic .

"By . Jenni Murray . PUBLISHED: . 17:17 EST, 5 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:25 EST, 5 June 2013 . Confirmation that I had begun what we used to know as 'the change of life' came as no shock to me whatsoever. Actually, it was a huge relief. I was in my mid-40s and had been experiencing the usual symptoms: unpredictable periods, feeling a bit low, and the occasional hot flush and night sweat. My wonderful GP did a blood test, confirmed my suspicions, asked whether I wanted Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) pills or patches. And that was that. My childbearing days were over. The menopause years have been 'the most rewarding of my life' Believe it or not, I welcomed it. With two sons then in their teens, I had no desire for more children. Having spent half my life trying to control my fertility - first to avoid being an unmarried mother, then to prevent expansion of my family which I saw as large enough - the menopause was, frankly, very welcome. And while some women regard ageing and the loss of their fertility as depressing, I have never been one to fuss about growing older and, hopefully, wiser. That is why I read reports last week from the biologist Dr Aarathi Prasad - arguing that the menopause may soon become a thing of the past, with women 'evolving' out of it - with absolute horror. Dr Prasad says the menopause dates from a time when generations of women were competing over scarce resources, and it was not ideal for them all to bear children at the same time. Now, in an age when resources are . plentiful, life expectancies are longer and women remain healthier at a . greater age, she says the menopause is not necessary and women could . soon bear children in their 50s and beyond. Murray greeted the news that women may soon 'evolve' out of menopause with 'absolute horror' Heaven forbid. While medical science and the cosmetics industry constantly chase the dream of eternal youth, please could our fertility cycle be left to run its natural course? Menopause is a natural rite of passage, as rich as any other in a woman's life. A good thing, not to be dreaded or avoided, but to be met with courage and a sense of adventure. This is that moment when you realise you no longer have to worry about getting pregnant or nurturing needy small children; that you have moved into a freer stage of life where your time is more often your own. And believe me, that moment is truly liberating. Some of the most beautiful and effective women I know are in their 60s, 70s or even their 80s. Helen Mirren, Judi Dench and Joan Bakewell to name but three. I was deeply touched when I once asked the politician and academic Baroness Shirley Williams about the anxiety so many women feel about losing their fertility as they grow older. She said: 'Getting older in public life is so secondary. If you see yourself only as a sexual, reproductive being, I'm sure it's hard if that part of life is behind you. But for me, even as a mother, it was only one part. I've always been valued, and valued myself, for other things.' Her wisdom is a lesson to us all, and one I have tried wholeheartedly to embrace. We should not be ashamed of growing old: we should embrace our wrinkles and be engaged with and admired for everything we've learned in our lives. As soon as I had my diagnosis, I took my doctors' advice and popped the HRT pills. My mother had a terrible time at around the same age and had taken HRT for 20 years with heartening results, so I followed her lead. I was told it would help sustain my energy and assist in stemming the loss of collagen in my skin. This way, my face would remain fresh, my hair thick and glossy, and I would not be plagued by hot flushes during a broadcast. The different ways in which women react to the menopause is a subject I am deeply interested in, and prompted me to write my book, Is It Me Or Is It Hot in Here? - A Modern Woman's Guide To The Menopause, ten years ago. 'Menopause is a natural rite of . passage, as rich as any other in a woman's life. A good thing, not to be . dreaded or avoided, but to be met with courage and a sense of . adventure.' In the introduction I pointed out how, given today's life spans, many women will be post-menopausal for a third of their lives. As we bring up our children so much later, we have to deal with that explosive hormonal cocktail; the menopausal woman and the teenage son or daughter. We also have to decide whether we want to go along with science that keeps us young, either through pills or the surgeon's knife. We can grow old disgracefully with hair dye as our constant companion, or be graceful and grey in the distinguished manner once only available to men. For some of the women I spoke to during my research, the menopause was a distressing time. Hot flushes and heavy periods are hardly pleasant experiences. But it rarely lasts long and there's no evidence to say the menopause has a damaging effect on a woman's brainpower. I remember the actress Julie Walters appearing on a television show to discuss her role as the dance teacher in the film of Billy Elliot. Julie and I are the same age, 63, and it was so refreshing to hear her laugh about her hot flushes during the dance routines. By this time I was on HRT, which stopped the flushes and night sweats. But after ten years of taking it, I developed breast cancer  - something I firmly believe would not have happened had I let the menopause pass naturally. Is It Me or Is It Hot in Here? 'Fans, darling, fans,' Katie Boyle once said. 'Always carry an elegant one.' If I had my time again, I would embrace the changes and welcome the freedom heralded by the absence of periods. I'd do my best to protect my heart with regular exercise and not smoking. And I'd take the advice given to the former newsreader, Angela Rippon, by Katie Boyle, one of the television stars of the Sixties and Seventies. When asked if she had ever taken HRT, Katie replied: 'No, darling. Fans, darling, fans. Always carry an elegant one.' I've now been post-menopausal for nearly 20 years and I can truly say they've been the most rewarding of my life. I've seen my boys grow into smashing young men, accompanied my parents through the ends of their lives, dealt with a life-threatening disease and loved every minute of working harder than ever and having more time to spend with friends. Another argument Prasad used to bolster her theory that the menopause was obsolete in the modern world was the 'grandmother hypothesis'. Hormone replacement therapy tablets: Many experiencing menopause use them to ease the effects of menopause . This makes the assumption that the menopause evolved in tribal cultures, because it creates a generation of child-free older women who can help the fertile childbearers look after the families: the maternal grandmother becomes the key person responsible for raising, but not bearing, children. But in the West, Dr Prasad argues, that system no longer prevails. Instead, older women are increasingly healthy and able to raise their own young families. However, the idea that the role of grandparents is now obsolete simply isn't borne out by evidence. Didn't research published last week by Grandparents Plus and Age UK reveal that the nation's grandparents save families £7.3 billion a year by taking on childcare for their working sons and daughters? The older generation cares for 1.6 million children, and the hours they put in have risen to 1.7 billion - a 35 per cent rise since 2004. So it seems the 'grandmother hypothesis' is actually a perfect fit for Western economies, where both parents often need to work but can't afford paid childcare. Post-menopausal women have a vital place in the world and should feel no need to compete with young women of childbearing age. I hope Dr Prasad's vision is wrong. A world where the menopause has died out to allow more babies to be born to women aged 50-plus is not one I'd ever welcome. Evolution should stand still on that score and the menopause should stay as it is - a valuable midlife experience beyond which women can enjoy new freedoms.","Jenni Murray greeted the onset of menopause with huge relief .

Family doctors have been reprimanded for leaving answerphone messages when they are at lunch or in a meeting telling patients to dial the NHS 111 service. Health bosses have written to GP practices warning them it is a breach of contract to divert patients to the new helpline during normal working hours. NHS England – the new body in charge of the Health Service – said some practices had been leaving recorded messages when they closed for lunch or during meetings. Don't leave a message: GPs have been reprimanded for leaving voicemail messages when they are out for lunch and daytime meetings telling patients to dial the 111 out-of-hours service for advice and treatment . The British Medical Association, which represents GPs, accused the organisation of trying to deflect the blame over its disastrous launch of the helpline. The system was expanded nationally this spring to provide medical advice for patients round-the-clock as long as it isn’t a 999 emergency. But there are concerns patients are being put at risk because they are being given the wrong information by unqualified call centre workers manning the phones. Under their contract with the NHS, GPs must provide care for patients between 8am and 6.30pm, Monday to Friday. But many surgeries close for lunch or on certain afternoons when doctors hold meetings, training sessions or work elsewhere. Some have an arrangement with an out-of-hours firm or locum doctors who provide temporary cover during these times. Any patient ringing the surgery at these times will be played a recorded message telling them to call the firm or locum if they cannot wait until it re-opens. But NHS England said it had been made aware that a handful of practices were leaving messages urging patients to dial NHS 111. A letter sent out to all practices in the capital last month states: ‘It has recently come to our attention that there are an increasing number of examples of where GP practices are diverting patients to NHS 111 during their core hours of 08.00-18.30 on Monday-Friday.’ Second best: There are concerns patients are being put at risk because unqualified call centre workers are giving them the wrong information . It reminds them that diversion of patients to 111 during lunchtimes, half-days or if they suddenly become busy is a ‘misuse’ of the service. The letter, signed by the three senior managers, adds that practices will be issued with ‘breach notices’ if they are found to be referring patients to the helpline. This could lead to them having their contracts terminated and being closed down. The BMA accused NHS England of ‘bullying’ GPs and being overly ‘heavy-handed’ when only a few surgeries were at fault. Dr Richard Vautrey, deputy chair of the BMA’s General Practitioners’ Committee, said that practices had been mistakenly using the same answerphone message during the day time as is played out-of-hours. When the surgery is closed during evenings and weekends, patients will be told to dial NHS 111. But some practices may mistakenly using this same message during the daytime when they should record a separate one telling patients to call to firm providing cover. He said: ‘This is a problem which could easily have been solved without some threatening letter to practices. ‘It’s bullying. There’s been so much reaction to NHS England’s position and failings over NHS 111 and it’s like they are trying to deflect the blame which really isn’t acceptable.’ There is growing tension between the Government and the BMA over its plans to force doctors to be responsible for patients round-the-clock. Health secretary Jeremy Hunt last month angered GPs for claiming that a contract that enabled them to give-up working evenings and weekends had led to soaring numbers of patients attending A&E units.","NHS England claims some practices are leaving messages telling patients to dial the out-of-hours service when they are closed for lunch .

He said: 'Our grandparents used to make a point of not throwing away leftover food. Consumerism has made us accustomed to wasting food daily and we are unable to see its real value. The pope urged people not to waste food and said doing so was like stealing from the poor and hungry . 'Throwing away food is like stealing from the table of those who are poor and hungry.' The comments are his latest call for greater social responsibility among the world's 1.2billion Roman Catholics. Since . taking office in March, Pope Francis has said he wants the Church to . defend the poor and to practise greater austerity itself. He has also made several calls for global financial reform. Around 1.3billion tonnes of food, or one third of what is produced for human consumption, gets lost or wasted every year, according to the United Nations' food agency. In the industrialised world the majority of waste is by consumers, often because they buy too much and have to throw away what they do not manage to eat. U.N. study found about 1.3billion tonnes of food is wasted every year . A U.N.-backed study released today said simple measures such as better storage and reducing over-sized portions would sharply reduce the vast amount of food going to waste. In U.S. restaurants, diners wasted nine per cent of the meals they bought, partly because of a trend to increase the size of everything from cheeseburgers to soft drinks, said the report by the World Resources Institute and the U.N. Environment Programme. Pope Francis said the 'culture of waste' was especially deplorable given the prevalence of hunger in the world. The United Nations says hunger affects some 870million people, while 2billion suffer from at least one nutritional deficiency. The Argentinian-born pontiff warned that too much focus on money and materialism meant financial market dips were viewed as tragedies while human suffering had become normal and ignored. 'In this way people are discarded as if they were garbage,' he said.","Pope Francis said consumerism has made people used to wasting food .

The Air Force has stripped 17 officers of their authority to control - and, if necessary, launch -  nuclear missiles, due to their shockingly low proficiency in operating a missile launch simulator during a routine inspection. During a March inspection of the 91st Missile Wing at Minot Air Force Base, N.D., . the team earned the equivalent of a 'D' grade when tested on its mastery of . Minuteman III missile launch operations . In April, base officials quietly removed 17 officers, more than 10 per cent of the total force at Minot serving in the highly sensitive role of standing 24-hour watch over . the Air Force's most powerful nuclear missiles, the intercontinental . ballistic missiles that can strike targets across the globe. Concern: The Air Force stripped 17 officers of their authority to control a nuclear missiles, after their poor performance during an inspection (Officers simulate launching a Minuteman III ICBM in 2009 at Minot AFB) The group's deputy commander said it is suffering 'rot' within its ranks. 'We are, in fact, in a crisis right . now,' the commander, Lt. Col. Jay Folds, wrote in an internal email . obtained by The Associated Press and confirmed by the Air Force. Folds is deputy commander of the 91st . Operations Group, whose three squadrons are responsible for manning the . wing's 15 Minuteman III launch control centers. The wing has 150 officers assigned to missile launch control duty. The U.S. Force has an estimated 450 . Minuteman-III missiles stored at missile silos around three bases - F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming, Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana . and Minot. The email describes a culture of indifference, with at least one intentional violation of . missile safety rules and an apparent unwillingness among some to . challenge or report those who violate rules. Folds also complained about . unwarranted questioning of orders from superior officers by launch crews . and failure to address superiors with the proper respect. Security: The disciplined officers showed a lack of knowledge in operating a missile launch simulator and compromised the security of launch codes (pictured in 2010, airmen at Minot AFB) Possible . disciplinary action is pending against one other officer at Minot, who had purposefully broken a missile safety rule in an . unspecified act that could have compromised the secret codes that enable . the launching of missiles, which stand on high alert in underground . silos in the nation's midsection. Officials said there was no compromise . of missile safety or security. Advising his troops on April 12 that they had 'fallen,' Folds wrote that drastic corrective action was required because 'we didn't wake up' after an underwhelming inspection in March. 'Now we're discovering such rot in the crew force that your behavior while on alert is accepting of' weapons safety rule violations, possible code compromises and other failings, 'all in the name of not inconveniencing yourselves,' Folds wrote. 'We are breaking you down, and we will build from the ground up,' Folds added. Folds' superiors, Col. Robert Vercher, commander of the 91st Missile Wing, said inspectors rated officers proficiency in operating the missile launch simulator . and responses to written questions about procedures. Their performance . was rated 'marginal,' which Vercher said is the equivalent of a 'D' grade. 'Nobody is comfortable with that,' Vercher said. Evaluation: Inspectors rated the officers during an evaluation of the 91st Missile Wing at Minot Air Force Base, N.D. (Two commanders stand on the platform at a missile silo in S.D. in Nov. 1964) The trouble at Minot is the latest in a . series of setbacks for the Air Force's nuclear mission, highlighted by a . 2008 Pentagon advisory group report that found a 'dramatic and . unacceptable decline' in the Air Force's commitment to the mission, . which has its origins in a Cold War standoff with the former Soviet . Union. In 2008, then-Defense Secretary Robert . Gates sacked the top civilian and military leaders of the Air Force . after a series of blunders, including the stunning mistake in a August 2007 incident in which an Air Force B-52 bomber flew from Minot to Barksdale Air Force Base, La., without the crew realizing it was armed with six nuclear-tipped cruise missiles. One outcome of the incident was the creation of Global Strike Command in January 2009 as a way of improving management of the nuclear enterprise. Bruce Blair, who served as an Air Force ICBM launch control officer in the 1970s and is now a research scholar at Princeton University, said the Folds email points to a broader problem within the nuclear weapons force. 'The nuclear air force is suffering from a deep malaise caused by the declining relevance of their mission since the Cold War's end over 20 years ago,' Blair said in an interview. 'Minuteman launch crews have long been marginalized and demoralized by the fact that the Air Force's culture and fast-track careers revolve around flying planes, not sitting in underground bunkers baby-sitting nuclear-armed missiles.' Blair is co-founder of Global Zero, an international group that advocates the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons.","Officers at the 91st Missile Wing at Minot Air Force Base, N.D. earned a 'D' grade during a March inspection .

A parasitic worm may hold the key to keeping skin grafts and plasters firmly in place over wounds, according to a new study. Researchers at Boston’s Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) have created a microneedle inspired by Pomphorhynchus laevis, a spiny-headed worm that lives in the intestines of its hosts. The worm securely attaches to the host's intestinal wall by piercing it and then expanding its cactus-like head into the intestinal tissue. The Karp lab invented this flexible microneedle adhesive patch that can stick to soft tissue . The graft contains microneedles with swelling tips. When they pierce the skin, the tips swell -  holding the graft in place. The swelling is reversible so the graft can be easily removed when the wound has healed. The microneedles are three times stronger than the stitches and staples currently used and are less prone to infection. ‘Dr Jeffrey Karp and his collaborators continue to look to nature to find new ways to solve real problems in medicine,’ said Dr Scott Somers. ‘Drawing on how parasitic worms attach to and feed on fish, they have designed a way to close surgical wounds that appears better than anything currently available for clinical use.’ Inspired by the worm's swelling mechanism, Dr Karp and his team created a sticky patch that can interlock with tissue by using microneedle tips that swell. The tips expand using a water-based mechanism that is both quick and reversible. ‘The adhesion strength of the tips of the microneedle is more than three times stronger than conventional surgical staples used for skin graft fixation,’ said Dr Seung Yun Yang, a BWH research fellow. Each cone-shaped needle is made of a stiff plastic non-swelling core, and a tip that is rigid in its dry state, but swells upon contact with water. ‘The unique design allows the needles to stick to soft tissues with minimal damage to the tissues. ‘Moreover, when it comes time to remove the adhesive, compared to staples, there is less trauma inflicted to the tissue, blood and nerves, as well as a reduced risk of infection,’ said Dr Karp. The invention may one day be an alternative to the trauma and infection-prone staples and sutures that are currently used in the operating theatre. How the needle tips swell to hold skin grafts in place over a wound . Bohdan Pomahac, MD, director of both . BWH Plastic Surgery Transplantation and the BWH Burn Centre, said: ‘I . envision that this device will be very effective in treating patients, . both by skin graft fixation, but also by delivery of active substances . into the surface of the wound. ‘These substances may be for example, antibiotics, growth-promoting compounds, or anti-inflammatory molecules. ‘It's . been a pleasure to collaborate with Dr Karp, who is a visionary in . science, to help provide the link to the microneedle adhesive's clinical . applicability.’ An artistic rendition of the spiny-headed worm, Pomphorhynchus laevis, which inspired the plaster .","Plaster contains microneedles with expanding tips to hold them in place .

Children as young as nine have been treated in hospital for alcohol-related illnesses, it has been revealed. And hospital emergency specialists have said they have seen a 'worrying' trend of an increase in young girls drinking. Figures from Lancashire Teaching Hospitals revealed during 2012/13 a total of 60 teenagers aged between 13 and 15 attended the emergency department with alcohol-related conditions. Figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act have revealed children as young as nine have been treated for alcohol-related illnesses (file picture posed by model) The information, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, also reveals that during 2008/09, at least one child aged nine attended the emergency department and was admitted to a hospital ward due to alcohol related reasons. And in the past 12 months, children as young as 11 and 12 have been treated in A&E or admitted to a hospital ward as a result of drinking too much. Hospital staff have revealed that they tend to see more under-age drinking in young girls than in boys and expressed their concern at youngsters putting themselves in vulnerable situations. Lynne Sime, acting matron of emergency medicine at Royal Preston Hospital, said: 'We have seen children as young as nine come into the emergency department as a result of alcohol and also a number of 11 and 12-year-olds. 'However, the majority of underage drinkers who end up in hospital tend to be 13 to 16-year-olds. 'With the young children, it is usually the case that they have a friend who is a bit older who has given them alcohol. Hospital staff have revealed that they tend to see more under-age drinking in young girls than in boys (file picture) 'Because they are younger, they do not metabolise alcohol as quickly as teenagers or adults, so it stays in their system and they become intoxicated and the affects of the alcohol are more pronounced. 'The worrying thing is that we are seeing a trend where there is more underage drinking in young girls. This is a concern as they are putting themselves in vulnerable positions because they do not know what is happening.' The statistics for Lancashire Teaching Hospitals show that during 2012/13, 27 15-year-olds attended the emergency department with alcohol related conditions, 20 14-year-olds and eight 13-year-olds. 'We usually get more cases in the summer . months when children break up from school and meet up in the holidays . with their friends in the park' - Lynne Sime, acting matron of emergency medicine at Royal Preston Hospital . There was also at least one 12-year-old and one 11-year-old attending A&E with alcohol problems, but the trust refused to reveal exact numbers. The affected young people were either treated and discharged from the emergency department or treated there and then admitted to a hospital bed. Lancashire Teaching Hospitals Trust, which runs the Royal Preston and Chorley and South Ribble Hospitals, works in partnership with Young Addiction and Discover Drug and Alcohol Services. Clinics are held weekly in the emergency department for patients who have been referred. The trust is also introducing a hospital alcohol liaison nurse at the end of this month who will be employed by the trust. Ms Sime said: 'We do get the odd accidental case where a child has drunk alcohol by mistake, but the majority of underage alcohol cases that we see are young people experimenting with alcohol with their older friends as a result of peer pressure. 'We usually get more cases in the summer months when children break up from school and meet up in the holidays with their friends in the park. Figures from Lancashire Teaching Hospitals revealed during 2012/13 a total of 60 teenagers aged between 13 and 15 attended the emergency department with alcohol-related conditions (file picture) 'When they come into hospital, we assess them and if they are intoxicated, they get a dedicated nurse to look after them. We give them IV fluids to help their alcohol absorption. 'We do not judge them as our role is to look after them. At the end of the day, they are children and it is all a learning curve. 'We treat them with compassion and understanding. A lot of them are mortified and distraught at being in the situation. 'However, if we see the same child more than once because of alcohol related issues, we speak to social services.' A spokesman for Lancashire County Council said: 'It is really important for everyone, especially young people, to remember that drinking above the recommended levels of alcohol can be hazardous to our health in a number of ways. 'Excessive drinking is associated with serious medical conditions such as cirrhosis of the liver and a wide range of digestive disorders. People often forget that heavy drinkers have an increased risk of developing cancer. 'There is also a strong association between alcohol abuse, injury and violent crime, and young people are more likely to put themselves in dangerous situations when they've been drinking to excess.'","Figures from Lancashire reveal number of children treated for drinking .

They were released on bail only when two separate friends acted as guarantors and handed over their passports. Miss Blake was bailed after a surety was paid by company manager Rowley Rees Brown, 42, a friend who lives in Dubai. She claimed she had not been arrested on suspicion of having sex and insisted she had been alone in the back of the cab. In an interview, she is reported to have said: ‘I have no idea where these sex allegations have come from because none were put to me by the authorities. 'I was arrested for having a bottle of beer in the back of a cab, not having sex. That is all. I was alone in the vehicle.’ Mr McRedmond, who is thought to work for an engineering firm, also denies the charges.

Nottinghamshire Police seized the 2.25 ton  tank under the Proceeds of Crime Act and cashed in on their discovery by selling it on eBay for £5,205 in January. They also found other military memorabilia, £2,000 in cash and a luxury Breitling watch at Barrett's £200,000 home in picturesque Barton-in-Fabis. The tank - complete with turret and fake cannon -was sold earlier this year but its origins only came to light after a meeting between Nottinghamshire Police and Crime Commissioner Paddy Tipping and other senior officers on Tuesday.

Detective Inspector Andy Baguley, from Nottinghamshire Police, said: 'This is a reminder of how powerful the Proceeds of Crime Act can be.

'It can be used to strengthen investigations and ultimately claw back the money and property held by those intent on a life of crime. 'By definition, the offence of money laundering will almost certainly have occurred where a theft or drugs transaction has taken place. 'Considering an additional money laundering offence allows us to access a whole raft of financial material, which could either support the prosecution of the original offence or provide an opportunity for a standalone charge where the original offence cannot be proven.'

Employees' claims, given as sworn testimony in a lawsuit, tell of wild partying, derogatory slurs and brawling at the members-only gym. The allegations appear to have so horrified those at the elite club that they tried legal action to keep the information coming out in the public domain - but to no avail. Members only: The reputation of the elite New York Athletic Club has been blighted by a sexual harassment lawsuit and reports of a brawl among members in April . Speaking out: Keisi Ballenilla has brought a sexual harassment lawsuit against her former employer, the New York Athletic Club . One employee and one former worker of . the Manhattan sports club have come forward to reveal that members . would use the N-word and female employees feared being sexually harassed . - but no action was taken by NYAC management against their wealthy . clients. The two men gave sworn testimony in the lawsuit brought by former waitress Keisi Ballenilla against the club, where it costs $8,500 to join and $3,000 a year in fees. Many employees refused to come . forward fearing they would lose their jobs at the elite . establishment which sits on the edge of Central Park, according to . transcripts seen by the New York Post. The . legal bid paints the club - which was founded in 1868, and boasts 231 . Olympic medals won by its members - in a less than decorous light. Club . managers were said to have swept employees' complaints about . inappropriate behavior under the carpet, according to the . depositions. Managers were also complicit in the wild partying and drinking at the club, the suit claims. Elvis Lopez, who has worked as a security man at . the club for seven years, said management and club members discriminated . against staff, according to the Post. Mr Lopez said that employees would be called racial slurs by guests and that one female employee was routinely shown images of half-naked men by guests - but no action was taken. The high life: Members of the NYAC, which sits on the edge of Central Park in Manhattan, costs $8,500 just to join . Miss Ballenilla, who worked at . the club for five years, has alleged that she was continually subjected . to sexual harassment by managers, singling out one boss Nesim Zuberi in particular. The New York Athletic Club had tried to keep the lawsuit out of public knowledge with a confidentiality order but it was rejected by a Manhattan court. MailOnline contacted the athletic club but calls were not returned at this time. It is not the first time that the club has found itself involved in criminal proceedings. In April, a rowdy bar-room brawl broke out among members, allegedly over a girl. Beginning . in the 'Tap Room' bar of the NYAC, the fight resulted in the arrest of . three men, with two reported broken noses and ten police being called to . cart off the angry fitness enthusiasts. One witness wrote on the blog WallStreetJackass: ‘It was the best fight I've ever seen. Young people, old people, girls, members, non-members, it was a nondiscriminatory ragematch. 'Not sure the reason but it seemed to be over a girl.' With no word on why the fight broke out, the club apparently had to deal with 'glasses thrown' around the room and a woman cut badly enough to require stitches. Emergency services did admit that in the early morning hours on April 13 a man with a cut head was transported to New York Downtown Hospital and one other man with unspecified injuries arrived at St. Luke’s-Roosevelt Hospital Center. The New York Times reported that when the dust cleared, Peter Doran, 28, and Matthew O’Grady, 31, were arrested and charged with third-degree assault and second-degree harassment. Also arrested was Colin Drowica, 30, thought to be a brokerage director who was charged with attempted menacing after he allegedly clutched a security guard's arm and threatened him. The club also attempted to keep this embarrassing incident under wraps. The New York Athletic Club was founded in 1868 and has approximately 8,600 members. Its main location is at 1800 Central Park South in Manhattan, a few blocks from the Plaza Hotel and the designer stores of 5th Avenue. There is a summer location for the club on Travers Island in Westchester County - an exclusive outpost nestled among upstate mansions and marinas packed with yachts. The Mad life: Don Draper (played by John Hamm) stands outside the New York Athletic Club in an episode of Mad Men . The club's long-established reputation as a haven of classy R&R has turned it into a renowned facet of the glamorous New York City lifestyle.

Frustration: Tory MP Anne McIntosh hung up on a 111 call centre worker after 15 minutes of 'completely inappropriate' questioning . A Tory MP has revealed how the NHS 111 helpline let down her dying father – a retired GP – in his hour of need. Anne McIntosh, 58, said she called the number after he developed worrying symptoms suggesting he had an infection. Despite pleading to be put through to a doctor or nurse, she was made to answer a series of ‘completely inappropriate’ questions by an unqualified worker ‘sticking religiously to the script’. After 15 minutes, the MP hung up ‘in sheer frustration’ and dialled 999 hoping to call out an ambulance. But as her father was so frail, paramedics were reluctant to transport him to the hospital 20 miles away and instead arranged for a GP to visit. The doctor did not arrive for another three hours and her father died from the urinary infection four days later. The Mail has repeatedly drawn attention to the failings of the helpline and the shocking state of out-of-hours care in our series The Out-of-Hours Debacle. The new phone service, which is meant to provide round-the-clock medical advice, has replaced NHS Direct and local GP out-of-hours numbers. Depending on a patient’s condition, they will either be told to go to A&E, given an appointment at a GP clinic or offered medical advice over the phone. But many people are being put through to call centre workers with just a few weeks training, who can only use a computer system to assess the severity of their illness. The MP – who is also a lawyer – acknowledged that her father’s death would have been very difficult to prevent. However, she said that both her father and her family had been failed by the helpline. ‘What is particularly poignant for me and my family is that my father had been a local GP in that area for some 30 years,’ she said. ‘He attended patients in all weathers and at all hours. My father was from a generation of GPs who were used to working all hours. He worked every other night on call and every other weekend on duty. ‘And he always made sure he put his patients first. It is obviously a source of some regret that he did not have similar access to a GP in his own hour of need.’ The MP for Thirsk and Malton, North Yorkshire, recounted her experience during a debate about the helpline in the Commons earlier this week. She had been visiting her father in County Durham – one of a handful of ‘pilot’ areas where the helpline has been running since 2010. She said: ‘When I called 111 I got the ritual reply of sticking very closely to a script, which I found completely inappropriate at times.  I explained my father’s condition but the responder insisted on sticking religiously to the script – asking whether the patient was breathing, whether they were bleeding. Concerns: Many 111 calls are answered by medically unqualified staff with only a few week's training (FILE PHOTO) ‘I kept saying that I was not reporting an accident but a regular condition, the symptoms of which were extremely plain, and asking whether I could, please, just be passed to a nurse or doctor. ‘I have to say that in the end I hung up in sheer frustration ten or 15 minutes into the call because I could tell that I was not getting anywhere quickly.’ Yesterday NHS England released figures which it claimed showed the system was ‘steadily improving’ with 92 per cent of patients being ‘satisfied’ with the call centre staff. But there were huge gaps in the data with crucial statistics apparently ‘not available’ for certain areas of the country where the launch of the helpline has been disastrous. And earlier this week a leaked official report revealed how calls were routinely answered by untrained staff, patients were put on hold and doctors’ warnings ignored. Recently Miss McIntosh, who is married but uses her maiden name, upset some women GPs by referring to the high cost of training female doctors who may end up working just a few days a week. She claimed those who only work part-time after having children are putting a ‘burden’ on the NHS.","Anne McIntosh called line but hung up 'in sheer frustration' after 15 minutes .

A college football coach has spoken of his joy at being cleared of child pornography charges stemming from cellphone videos he filmed of his kids dancing naked after a bath. Todd Hoffner said he was 'thankful to be waking up from this nightmare' during an emotional news conference alongside his wife after a judge dismissed the case today. The head coach at Minnesota State-Mankato was arrested in August when the videos were found on . his university-issued phone after he took it to the I.T. department to . be checked out. Relief: Todd Hofner speaks out alongside his wife Melodee after being cleared of child porn charges . Emotional: The football coach revealed the toll the charges had had on his family life . The three videos showed his children - aged five to nine years old - dancing around naked in their home and touching their private parts. On Friday, Blue Earth County District Judge Krista Jass said she had not found any evidence that the videos amounted to pornography. 'The videos under consideration here contain nude images of Defendant's minor children dancing and acting playful after a bath. That is all they contain,' she wrote in her 24-page ruling. 'My wife and I have anticipated this day . for a very long time,' Hoffner said after his acquittal. 'It has . finally taken a person with courage and authority to realise what these . videos were.' Joy: Hoffner now hopes to resume his job as head coach at Minnesota State-Mankato as soon as possible . Overwhelmed: The coach appeared to have tears in his eyes at the end of his news conference . Media storm: Hoffner has been firmly in the public eye since being arrested in August . The university placed Hoffner, who has . been the school's head football coach since 2008, on administrative . leave after the videos were found. He now says he is keen to return to work, but a spokesman for the university said he would remain on leave pending the school's own investigation. He had no timetable for when that could be completed. Dismissed: Hoffner had been charged for making child porn for footage of his children naked . Hoffner, 46, and his wife, Melodee, had both maintained there was nothing inappropriate about the videos, which they said simply showed the children being silly. His attorney Jim Fleming singled out Mike Hanson, an assistant county prosecutor, for bringing charges in the first place. 'Mr Hanson essentially argued that this was child pornography because he knows it when he sees it,' Hoffner said. A search of computers taken from the . Hoffner home has found 'no additional items that would be considered . child pornography,' said Blue Earth County Sheriff's Captain Rich Murry. Hoffner had been charged with one . count of using minors in a sexual performance or pornographic work and . one count of possessing child pornography. Both are felonies. Hanson - who cast the final decision that the images were . pornographic and an arrest had to be made - had said: 'Adults should not . make videos of children in lewd poses - period.' But in court, Hoffner explained the context surrounding the videos. Two of them - which prosecutors said are the most troubling - show his children fooling around after a whirlpool bubble bath. They drop their towels and run around naked. At one point, the eight-year-old son grabs his genitals and his daughters bend over and spread their buttocks apart. These were shot in June. Search: No child porn was found on the computers taken from the Hoffner family home . Support: Hoffman's wife Melodee publicly rejected the charges as 'ridiculous and baseless' Hoffner told the court, that after . their bath, the children came down to where he was working and asked . their father to videotape them because they had made up a skit and . wanted their dad to record it - which he did on the work Blackberry, . according to the Star Tribune. 'It started with their towels on,' he said. 'They were singing, dancing and laughing. They were doing silly things, having fun.' He said his son seemed determined to 'sabotage' his sisters' routine and jumped in front of them and 'grabbed his private parts' for a few seconds. He said he stopped recording at this . point but then his daughters, who were upset with their brother, asked . them to record it again. This time, the son ran in naked with just a . football helmet on. Hoffner said at this point he stopped recording as . he knew his son was determined to 'mess everything up'. In an August video, one of the coach's . daughters is woken up by her father and told to go to the bathroom. As . she is followed to the bathroom, the camera is focused on her underwear. Controversy: Hoffner was arrested and escorted off a football practice field in August, he remains on leave pending a university investigation . Work place: Hoffner has been the head coach at MSU Mankato, pictured, since 2008 . He said he did not show the videos to anyone and did not even view them again after taking them. In fact, he forgot they were even on there when he took his phone to the university's IT department, he told the court. But Hanson said it is for this very reason that charges should be withheld. He said: 'You typically have videos made to show to your friends or put on Facebook. That didn't happen here and it didn't happen for a pretty good reason.' Hoffner said he was genuinely shocked when he was arrested on the pornography charges and he had no idea what videos they were talking about. A search of computers and other equipment taken from Hoffner's home when he was arrested turned up no evidence to support the prosecution's case. Social workers who interviewed the children and saw the videos said they found no evidence the couple's children had been abused.","Todd Hoffner, 46, was charged on two pornography counts after three videos of his children were found on a work-issued cellphone .

Pillar of the community: Locals in Ystradgynlais said it 'was a joke' that Cenydd Nickels was arrested . Furious that his 14-year-old son had been buying cannabis, Cenydd Nickels vowed to bring the dealer to justice. His anger was made worse by the fact his mother had recently been violently mugged for the sake of just £6 to buy drugs. But when the 53-year-old tracked down the culprit and carted him to a police station, officers were not interested. They let the suspect walk free...and put Mr Nickels in the dock instead. Their decision triggered a five-month, £100,000 legal battle that ended only when the Crown Prosecution Service decided to drop the charges without explanation. Mr Nickels had confronted the drug dealer in a ‘sting’ operation at a park, having been promised by police they would be there to make an arrest. No officers arrived and – following a fight – Mr Nickels, who is a dog warden and junior rugby coach, put the younger man in the boot of his car and drove to a police station. The station was closed so he telephoned officers who arrived 20 minutes later. To Mr Nickels’s horror, they arrested him for assault – even though the dealer told them he did not wish to press charges. The next day he was charged with kidnap and causing actual bodily harm. That led to ten court appearances until, at Swansea Crown Court last month, prosecutors decided to offer no evidence and he was formally acquitted of both charges. One of his neighbours in Ystradgynlais, near Swansea, said: ‘Cenydd is a pillar of our community. ‘He’s there for young people week in week out at the rugby club and is well known in the area for being a lovely guy. 'No one here will have a bad word to say about him. It’s a joke that he was arrested in the first place. What a waste of everyone’s time and money.’ Mr Nickels posted an emotional message on Facebook about his arrest in January. In it he said his mother had been left black and blue by her mugging ordeal and needed hospital treatment, including stitches, for her injuries. He added: ‘I would like to take this opportunity to thank my family, county councillors, community councillors, scout leaders and the people who have supported me over the past few weeks. Battle: Mr Nickels appeared at Swansea Crown Court ten times during the five month legal struggle. Last month, prosecutors decided to give no evidence and Mr Nickels was acquitted . ‘We have won the battle, but not the war over drugs in our community. We must stick together and keep on top of the drug dealers and report them to the police, so that they will always be looking over their shoulder in future. ‘We as a community have to help the police to get rid of this scum and hope they will respond to our concerns. 'There will always be someone out there who will try to make money on the backs of our children by selling drugs to them. ‘They will cause misery and heartache to our families. Our community is worth protecting. Our children are worth protecting. Our children are worth fighting for.’ No one from Dyfed-Powys Police was available for comment yesterday.","53-year-old Cenydd Nickels drove drug dealer to police station after officers didn't show up for sting operation .

Activists in Turkey have called for protestors to be released and police chiefs to be removed from office in a list of demands to the government after almost a week of demonstrations. They said if the demands are met it could end days of anti-government protests that have engulfed the country, as trade unions joined the outpouring of anger and called on the prime minister to resign. The activist group denounced Recep Tayyip Erdogan's 'vexing' style and urged the government to halt Taksim Square . redevelopment plans and lift restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly.

Protesters carry stones to build a barricade on a street in Istanbul ahead of clashes with police . Garbage burns in Ankara after thousands took to the streets calling for the Prime Minister to resign . In a meeting with the deputy prime minister Bulent Arinç, they also called for the government to ban the use of tear gas by police and demanded that officials responsible for the violent crackdown be removed from office. The demonstrations were sparked on Friday by the heavy-handed police response to a protest against trees being uprooted in Istanbul's landmark Taksim Square. It snowballed into nationwide protests against what demonstrators see as Erdogan's increasingly authoritarian rule. Police have deployed water cannons and tear gas has clouded the country's city centres. The Ankara-based Human Rights Association says close to 1,000 people have been injured and more than 3,300 people have been detained over five days of protests. The protests appear to have developed spontaneously and remain leaderless. It was not at all certain that the tens of thousands of protesters would heed any call by the group to cease. The group of academics, architects and environmentalists, known as the Taksim Solidarity Platform, was formed to try to keep Taksim Square from redevelopment, including the rebuilding of an Ottoman army barracks and a shopping centre. Young demonstrators pass bricks for a makeshift barricade in Istanbul . Activists demanded police chiefs responsible for the heavy-handed tactics used by officers step down.

The protests were sparked by fury over a  pre-dawn police raid on Friday to roust activists camping out in an attempt to stop the plans. Protests appeared calmer today, even as thousands of trade union members on a two-day strike marched to Taksim and into central Ankara. In Ankara, protesters sarcastically called themselves 'looters', a reference to the name Erdogan's used for the demonstrators last week. A sign on a stall in Taksim providing free food and water read 'Revolution Market'. There were scattered violent clashes overnight on roads leading to Erdogan's offices in Ankara and Istanbul, as well as in the city of Antakya, near the Syrian border, where a protester was killed by an apparent blow to the head. Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc, who is standing in for Erdogan while he is on a trip to Northern Africa, has offered an olive branch to protesters, apologising for what he said was a 'wrong and unjust' crackdown on the sit-in. Erdogan had inflamed protesters, calling them an extremist fringe, and refusing to back away from plans to revamp Taksim. Young workers and students have joined forces with older trade union leaders and academics in the protests .

Many protestors have worn masks to protect them from tear gas and to prevent recognition . 'The steps the government takes from now on will define the course of society's reaction,' Eyup Muhcu, the head of a chamber of architects, said after meeting with Arinc. U.S .Secretary of State John Kerry said earlier this week that it was troubled by reports of excessive force by the police. He also said Washington is 'deeply concerned' by the large number of people who have been injured. The comments angered Turkey, with its state-run news agency reporting that Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu accused the U.S. of treating it 'as a second-class democracy.' He also complained that Washington did not react to similar protests in other countries, the Anadolu Agency said. Kerry has maintained that his comments were not intended as interference in Turkey's internal affairs, but an honest expression of the importance the United States places on such values in all countries. In Turkey's third largest city, Izmir, police detained 25 people for 'spreading untrue information' on social media and allegedly inciting people to join the protests, Anadolu reported.

They are sentiments that we all share.' It was not immediately clear what the Twitter comments were. Turkey's main broadcast media have been criticized for shunning the coverage of police brutality at the protest onset. Many people turned to social media to keep up to date. Erdogan has referred to social media as 'the worst menace to society'.","Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinç met activists on Wednesday .

Bonus: Network Rail chief executive David Higgins is to receive £100,000 extra on top of a salary of £577,000 . The boss of Network Rail triggered outrage yesterday after pocketing a lavish £100,000 bonus at a time when passengers face soaring fares and overcrowded trains. One in ten trains ran late last year, but Sir David Higgins was one of five rail executives who shared a £350,000 bonus pool despite missing targets over safety, punctuality and financial efficiency. Sir David is chief executive of Network Rail, which receives more than £3billion a year of taxpayers’ money. He received a bonus of £99,082 on top of his salary of £577,000, while four fellow chiefs were paid sums of between £59,000 and £67,000. If more than 92.5 per cent of trains had run to time, the executives would have been entitled to an even bigger bonus. But the figure was only 90.9 per cent. There was also a bonus cut of 10 per cent ‘to reflect failings’ in workforce safety. Maria Eagle, Labour’s shadow transport secretary, said: ‘Commuters facing inflation-busting annual fare rises will be outraged at the scale of the bonus packages being enjoyed by a few at the top of the rail industry.’ Network Rail chairman Richard Parry-Jones defended the payouts, describing 2012 as a year of ‘positive progress’. He said punctuality rates were ‘particularly impacted by a year of extreme weather, the wettest on record’. Sir David will get a bonus for 2012-13 of £99,082 while Group finance director Patrick Butcher, who is on a salary of £394,000, will get a bonus of £67,658. Concerns: The Network Rail remuneration committee reduced bonuses for top bosses by 10 per cent over concerns about staff safety . Robin Gisby, the network operations . managing director, and Simon Kirby, infrastructure projects managing . director, will both get bonuses of £63,708. Paul Plummer, the company's group strategy director, is being awarded a bonus of £59,759. Network .

Download our cars guide . But Sir David and his fellow top bosses will be getting pay rises of 2.5 per cent for 2013-14 ‘in line with the management pay award for the rest of the company’. NR chairman Richard Parry-Jones said: ‘2012 was a year of positive progress for the company with some great highs - delivering seamless transport for the Olympics - to lows of frustration with a slowdown in our rate of delivering better train punctuality. ‘While this was particularly impacted by a year of extreme weather, the wettest on record, we are working to improve the resilience of our network to cope with such demands.’ He went on: ‘Our executive bonus payments for this year correctly reflect successes as well as shortcomings and as a result have been significantly reduced from a potential award of 60per cent of salary to 17per cent for the financial year just completed. ‘Bonuses are only awarded for achievements significantly beyond what is expected of an executive in the delivery of their challenging day jobs. ‘The remuneration committee felt that while performance was good in most areas, truly exceptional performance had not been achieved in financial efficiency and asset stewardship, and our train performance targets were not met. ‘But we also needed to recognise the significant successes that had been delivered in the business during the year.’ Crowds: Bonsues were reduced after Network Rail missed targets for 92.5 per cent of trains to arrive on time . A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘As a private sector company, it is for Network Rail's remuneration committee to determine the value of payments. ‘It is the independent Office of Rail Regulation's job to ensure that the company's new incentive schemes only reward where performance delivers real value for taxpayers and farepayers.’ But Manuel Cortes, general secretary of transport Union TSSA, said: ‘The rail industry continues to reward failure on a grand scale. Again, NR have missed their punctuality and safety targets and still awarded directors massive bonuses. ‘As passengers face yearly fare increases, they will be puzzled why the directors across the rail industry, who cannot make their trains run on time, continue to reward themselves with taxpayers' money. Such announcements by the industry are the equivalent of several great train robberies each year."" He went on: ‘It adds insult to injury that Network Rail sought to justify such payments by reducing the payments by only 10 per cent to reflect the failure to improve workforce safety. ‘Coming only a month after NR was yet again being fined over a level crossing death, life is starting to sound very cheap indeed.’","Sir David Higgins gets payout on top of £577,000 salary .

Children as young as four have committed offences as serious as vandalism, theft and robbery, shock figures reveal today. A Freedom of Information request has revealed the disturbing catalogue of child crime dealt with by just one regional police force over the past two years. In one incident a pair of four-year-olds vandalised a car - leaving their parents to pay for the damage. Watch out for the cute ones: A Freedom of Information request has revealed the disturbing catalogue of child crime dealt with by just one regional police force over the past two years. (Stock image) In another, a seven-year-old was responsible for breaking into a shed while elsewhere a nine-year-old was caught committing a robbery. But no children were charged as they were under ten and therefore not deemed criminally responsible for their actions. Instead child offenders are normally subjected to curfews or referred to youth offending teams. The . figures, released by Nottinghamshire Police following a Freedom of . Information request, show that 83 offences were committed by under-tens . between April 2011 and April 2013. No children under the age of ten were charged as they are not deemed responsible for criminal actions. (Picture posed by model) Officers were called to incidents involving 94 children - including some repeat offenders. Roger Hopkins Burke, criminology lecturer at Nottingham Trent University said very young children who committed crime could be influenced by older youngsters. 'I think ten is too young but the worry is people assume you do things under the age of criminal responsibility and you get away with it - but that's not true,' he said. 'Some children are out on the street without adult supervision. 'It is about upbringing and what goes on in the family home.' Paddy Tipping, Police and Crime Commissioner for Nottinghamshire Police., said the force was committed to dealing with youngsters outside of the courts. He said community resolutions are used in the hope children will accept responsibility and learn from their actions. He added: 'I'm not sure these numbers are surprising, given the size of Notts. 'The fact that very young children don't go to court doesn't mean that nothing happens. 'We know we need to keep young people away from court using early intervention. 'The action of the four year-old is not as important as what the copper says to the parents.' Sergeant Deb Barton, from Notts Police's youth issues division, said: 'What we are doing now is going back with the children to their parents, talking to the victims of the crime and saying, ""this is what's happened, it needs to be put right"".'","Shocking figures revealed by Freedom of Information request .

British student Melisa Kenber said she was sprayed with tear gas as she tried to film the demonstrations . A British student was chased by Turkish riot police wielding tear gas after she began to film anti-government protests. Melisa Kenber, 19, of Ripon, North Yorkshire, had been visiting family in Istanbul when she became caught up in the riots. As she started to video the police they yelled, 'No pictures, no pictures,' and ran after her until she reached her car, her eyes streaming from the gas. The former head-girl, who was by herself in the square, said she was left in agony with red, raw eyes after being chased by riot police back to her car. She arrived in the country amid some of the biggest protests in Turkey for years. Tens of thousands of Turks have joined anti-government protests over the past four days expressing discontent with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's 10-year rule. The demonstrations were sparked by the heavy-handed police response to a protest in Taksim Square on Friday against a new development. It has since spread across the country as secular Turks voice their anger against perceived authoritarian policies, including the promotion of headscarves for women and tightening of alcohol laws. Miss Kenber said she could sense the tensions as soon as she arrived in the country, where she stayed with her grandmother. She said: 'I go to Istanbul every year but this time I went, before it all kicked off, I had never hear people so frustrated and angry and complain about the government.

But she saw events for herself when she was caught up in clashes trying to reach the airport to return to the UK on Saturday morning. Miss Kenber said she wishes she could have joined the protests for longer but had booked her flight in advance. She told Mail Online: 'I was scared at that moment but glad at the same time. 'I am guessing it was tear gas. I was crying and my eyes were so red. It was difficult to breathe. 'It felt like I was inhaling pepper.' She said she went to Taksim Square to see if she could catch a bus as the police had closed off many of the roads. She said: 'There was tear gas everywhere. I ran up to the square and there were hundreds of police buses. 'There were burnt advertising boards on the building sites and rubble and broken glass everywhere. 'The police had completely blocked off the park so nobody could leave. 'I decided to video the policemen and they started shouting, ""No pictures, no pictures"". 'And . then they started chasing me.

A picture of academic Ceyna Sungar being doused in pepper spray has been shared across the world as used as a galvanising force for further demonstrations. Miss Kenber, whose parents are Turkish, said the majority of the protesters are educated people who are fighting for their rights. She said: 'I am glad something is being done. I don't think the country will ever be the same again.' Turkey's deputy prime minister Bulent Arinc yesterday offered an apology for the violent crackdown on an environmental protest, in a bid to appease the days of anti-government rallies as hundreds of riot police were deployed around the prime minister's office in the capital. The Turkish Human Rights Association said 3,300 people nationwide were detained during the four days of protests. At least 1,300 people were injured and a 22-year-old man died during a protest. Turkey's state-run news agency says police have detained 25 people for 'spreading untrue information' on social media and provoking protests. The Anadolu Agency said today they were detained in the city of Izmir for allegedly 'inciting the people to enmity and hate.' It said police were still looking for 13 others. Mr Aric described the crackdown as 'wrong and unjust' but Mr Erdogan, who is out of the country, has previously described protestors as 'looters' and dismissed the protests as acts by fringe extremists. A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said they were advising British nationals to avoid all demonstrations.","Melisa Kenber said she was chased to her car by riot police .

A children's fizzy drink sold by McDonald’s has won the right to be labelled as one of the recommended five-a-day portions of fruit and vegetables, even though it contains around six teaspoons of sugar. The fast-food giant has been cleared by the Advertising Standards Authority watchdog to put Fruitizz in the same category as eating an apple or a serving of broccoli. The drink is a mixture of fruit juice concentrate – including grape, raspberry and lemon – with fizzy water, natural flavourings and the preservative potassium sorbate. Health pop: McDonald's has won the right to label its new Fruitizz drink as one of the recommended five-a-day portions of fruit and vegetables . A small 250ml serving, which costs 89p, has 100 calories and 25g of sugar, which equates to around six teaspoons. The high levels of sugar come from the fruit juice content. But the ASA said that the addition of natural flavourings and preservatives in the drink ‘did not negate the five-a-day benefits of that 150ml of fruit juice, providing the entire 250ml serving was consumed’. The ASA made its decision after an investigation, which was launched in response to complaints about a McDonald’s TV commercial and an advert on the Mumsnet website. A voiceover on the TV advert said: ‘Grape, apple, and raspberry juice with refreshing sparkling water. 'Fruitizz is full of fruity bubbles with no added sugar, artificial colours or flavours. And it’s one of your child’s five a day.’ Malcolm Clark, of the Children’s Food Campaign, said the ASA ruling was evidence that the rules which define health claims around fruit and vegetables are not sufficiently strict. He added: ‘McDonald’s is only doing what other companies do: exploiting the laxness surrounding the five-a-day claims regime for commercial benefit. ‘We are concerned that increasingly the five-a-day message – originally designed to tackle cancer and heart disease – is being used to promote junk foods, sometimes with very low fruit or vegetable content. An investigation was launched in response to complaints about a McDonald's TV commercial and an advert on the Mumsnet website . ‘If the Government actually values the five-a-day claim and wants it to be a meaningful label that consumers can have confidence in, they need to re-issue and reinforce robust guidance restricting the five-a-day message to genuinely healthy foods.’ Dietitian Christina Merryfield, of London’s Bupa Cromwell Hospital, said: ‘Sugary drinks can encourage tooth decay and erosion and lead to weight gain. 'Water is a much better option and milk is great because it is full of calcium and other vitamins and minerals.’ A McDonald’s spokesman said: ‘We welcome the ruling by the ASA. Fruitizz is a drink designed for the Happy Meal menu, served in a 250ml measure as standard and it is not marketed in any larger sizes. ‘In the development of Fruitizz we followed the five-a-day guidance provided by the Department of Health. ‘Fruitizz contains no added sugars, artificial colours or artificial flavours and all size servings provide one daily portion of fruit, as defined by the Department of Health.’","Fast-food giant  cleared by the Advertising Standards Authority watchdog .

Family and friends of a 29-year-old diabetic have described the 'suffocating helplessness' of losing their loved one to a rare condition known as 'dead in bed syndrome'. Emily Pearce, a type 1 diabetic, died a year ago from the condition which causes unexplained deaths in young people suffering with the disease. Despite having managed her blood sugars successfully for 10 years, Emily died in her sleep after experiencing a suspected hypoglycaemic episode – a period of extremely low blood sugar levels. Emily Pearce, a type 1 diabetic, died a year ago from 'dead in bed syndrome' - a little understood condition that describes unexplained deaths in young people suffering with the disease . It is the term used to describe unexplained deaths of young people with type 1 diabetes. There is little evidence as to the exact cause of this rare phenomenon. One theory is that it is caused by an episode of extreme low blood sugar while the person is asleep. It is thought to account for around six per cent of deaths in under-40s suffering with type 1 diabetes. Emily, a social worker from Crowthorne in Berkshire, was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when she was a 19-year-old university student. She was very successful at managing her condition and managed to live life to the full, taking part in everything from scuba diving to abseiling and charity runs. However, despite showing no previous signs of illness, Emily was found dead in her bed at Easter last year. Following Emily’s death, her older sister Alison wrote a tribute to her on a memorial blog: ‘I am Emily's big sister and I am heartbroken. ‘The . period from April has been the hardest of my life and I wrestle daily . with my emotions to keep it all together and trust that my mind and body . somehow knows what to do on this crazy unknowable grieving journey.’ She wrote: ‘I am one of many . devastated people in Emily's world. I was totally blown away by the . hundreds of people paying their respects at her funeral, some of whom I . knew, but many I didn't. Ms Pearce, pictured with her parents David and Susan, died in her sleep after experiencing a suspected hypoglycaemic episode - a period of extremely low blood sugar levels . ‘Emily . with her acute modesty I hope understood on some level how liked, loved . and respected she was and how many people she had inspired and what a . lasting difference she had made in her profession because these are . things everyone aspires to in life.’ Alison's partner Iain blogged: ‘Emily was one of the most kind and caring people I have ever known. ‘She welcomed me in to her family and . over the last seven years, we shared some fantastic times together . which have not only left me with treasured memories but also, in her . absence, a desire to carry on something of the legacy of Emily's . goodness in my own life.

Alison told MailOnline: ‘She was a friend to me as well as being my sister – we were very close. ‘She was very dedicated to her work, she always challenged herself and she was always smiling.’ Emily’s mother, Susan Pearce, also added to the memorial blog.

A 12-year-old girl has killed herself after relentless online bullying from her classmates, her family has claimed. Gabrielle Molina's 15-year-old sister found the young girl hanging in a bedroom at her family's home in Queens Village, New York on Wednesday afternoon, police said. The girl, who attended a local middle school, left a heartbreaking note explaining that she had taken her life after suffering taunts online from her classmates, the New York Post explained. Tragedy: Gabrielle Molina, 12, was found hanged in a bedroom at her family's home in Queens, pictured . In the letter, she also apologized to her family - her sister, 21-year-old brother Geonel, and parents George and Glenda - for taking her life. Her mother told police that Gabrielle was depressed over the taunts and revealed that her other daughter, Georgia, had forced her way into the bedroom when Gabrielle did not answer. Gabrielle's aunt, Irma Molina, told the Post that she didn't understand the young girl's death. 'She's very quiet, very friendly,' she said. 'She wanted . to dance and sing. She’s so young.' Neighbors also told the Post of their shock at the death of the young girl, whose family has lived at the home for nearly 10 years. 'Cruel': Fellow students at her school, pictured, drove her to suicide, she reportedly explained in a note . 'They're just a wonderful family,' said a neighbor. 'It's just so sad. I don't know how they are going to get by.' The National Crime Prevention Council notes that 43 per cent of teens are subject to cyberbullying, and there have been recent, high profile cases. In one heartbreaking story, 15-year-old Felecia Garcia killed herself last October after fellow students allegedly posted a video of her having sex with members of the football team. She was branded a 'slut' and humiliated by her classmates online, eventually taking her life by jumping in front of a train.","Gabrielle Molina 'left a note explaining she had been taunted'

With their lithe golden legs, perfect figures and stunning looks, the Victoria's Secret models are girls that most of us would love to resemble. But although mimicking the girls' gazelle-like limbs and towering height might not be within reach of most of us, you can at least get the Victoria's Secret make-up look thanks to a new online tutorial. The video, which stars top British make-up artist, Polly Osmond, and Victoria's Secret Angel Erin Heatherton shows you how to get what the company describes as 'the modern Italian bombshell' look. Scroll down for video . Before: Erin Heatherton goes (almost) make-up free as Polly Osmond explains how to get the Dolce Vita look . Not surprisingly, the products used to create it all come from the Victoria's Secret make-up range but the tips can be used by anyone in possession of some bronze eye shadow, a kohl pencil and a pot of rosy pink blusher. 'Dolce Vita is all about being sexy so start the look with the black pencil,' explains Osmond. 'Work it into the eyelid. You don't have to be precise at this moment - this is just to get the shape.' Next, she continues, wing it out then work it into the inner corner of the eye and underneath as well. Follow by smudging the liner to create a classic smoky eye. 'Finish off the eye using the Eye Quad in Bellissima,' adds Osmond. 'I'm not using the green, just the bronze tones. Use the base colour just in the inner corner, blending it outwards.Then go over the eyeliner a little bit at a time and then working it into the eyelid. This look is all about blending so no hard lines.' Osmond then goes on to give Heatherton a suitably supermodel-esque glow, dusting highlighter across the model's cheekbones and dabbing a little onto the cupid's bow. Despite being just 24, model Erin Hetherton is a Victoria's Secret veteran and has been an Angel since 2008 . Almost complete: Polly Osmond puts the finishing touches to Erin's smouldering Italian bombshell beauty look . 'Then,' she concludes, 'I'm going to use a tiny bit of the . bronzer just to give a little bit of contour and then a little bit of . the blush just to give some colour to the cheeks.' One of the UK's top make-up artists, Osmond’s career has seen her work for a veritable who's who of fashion photography, including Miles Aldridge, Patrick Demarchelier and Annie Leibovitz. Along with her work for Victoria's Secret, Polly has also created make-up looks for designer brands such as Armani, Calvin Klein, Chanel, Clinique and Lancome.' 24-year-old Heatherton, meanwhile, has made a name for herself on the catwalk at Diane von Fürstenberg, Shiatzy Chen, Oscar de la Renta and Tommy Hilfiger among others. Despite her youth, the American model is a Victoria's Secret veteran and has worked with the brand since 2008.

A council has ordered its bin men not to go down uneven rural roads because they could suffer 'whole body vibrations'. Residents in Fife, which recently introduced a new three bin system for rubbish, have been left to drag their own bins, sometimes for long distances, after the local authority instructed refuse workers not to go down roads with 'too many potholes'. Nearly 500 people have complained about the extra loads they will need to pull so the council workers don't have to experience the 'vibrations'. Vibrating binmen: Refuse workers in Fife, Scotland, have been ordered to steer clear of country roads with too many potholes (file picture for illustration only) In one road in St Andrews - Prior Letham Road - residents will have to hike 39 bins half-a-mile, to the road-end. Some have questioned the decision, saying postmen travel on the roads every day. The Health and Safety Executive describes 'whole body vibration' as: 'Transmitted through the seat or feet of employees who drive mobile machines, or other work vehicles, over rough and uneven surfaces as a main part of their job'. Threat: Fife council is concerned their bin men could be vibrated by potholes . Liberal Democrat Councillor Donald . Macgregor (East Neuk & Landward) said: 'Residents in rural areas . have been informed of a new three-bin refuse collection service, . enabling the recycling of cans, plastics, paper and cardboard. 'However, if the access road is considered unsuitable due to the quality of its surface, the number of potholes or its narrowness, then residents will have to take their bins to the end of the road for collection. 'This is to avoid the staff being exposed to potentially damaging 'whole body vibration'.' Cllr Macgregor pointed out that whole body vibration was a European legislation concept not universally accepted. In . response to Cllr Macgregor's questions at a recent Fife Council . meeting, officials said that despite the number of appeals there was no . need to review the arrangements as anyone dissatisfied with the result . could use the corporate complaints procedure. Access roads are assessed by a recycling advisor and a council lorry driver. Cllr Macgregor said that he would be happy to be present on-site during these inspections. He . said: 'Tractor drivers, post office workers and others drive up these . roads and tracks without any evidence of whole body vibration damage. 'The . concept of whole body vibration is a product of European legislation . which, as I understand it, has been ignored by, for example, the . construction industry. Burden: Many resident are being forced to drag their three required recycling bins up to half a mile away . 'Rural residents pay the same taxes as their urban counterparts but receive a much reduced level of service. 'Their refuse bins should continue to be collected from the same locations as they are now.'Fife . Council’s waste collection service manager Martin Kingham said: 'Fife . Council has a responsibility to protect its employees from injuries . resulting from carrying out their jobs. 'Altering . the way Fife Council collects waste from rural properties will not only . reduce the risk of injury to staff but also provide an improved . recycling service. 'We . carried out a very thorough assessment of the 5,400 rural properties we . collect waste from and based our decision on the information gathered . and advice from independent consultants. Liberal Democrat Councillor Donald Macgregor said the decision had been made to avoid staff being exposed to potentially damaging 'whole body vibration' 'We understand residents will have concerns about a change in service which is why we have written to every affected householder and explained to them the reason for moving them to a road-end collection. 'If householders upgrade their access road they we can review our decision. We would be very happy to carry out a reassessment once any upgrading work has been completed. He added: 'Fife Council has information from independent consultants that shows that rural collection staff are exposed to unacceptably high levels of exposure to whole body vibration. As a result we must take action. 'Risk assessments were completed for each access track leading to rural properties. If the access road was deemed unsuitable then bins would be moved to road end in order to reduce the risks to our employees'.Fife Council says the following factors would make an access road unsuitable due to the risk of 'vibrations'. Potholes greater than 40 cm (about an inch and a half) deep.An 'unsuitably surfaced' access road. Maggie Picken, 41, who owns the St Andrews Coach Houses, in Priorletham, said the council hadn’t seemed to be consistent in the houses they picked. She said: 'The council sent out about . 4000 letters and about 500 people appealed the decision for end of road . collection, of which we were one. 'One of the issues was health and safety on rural roads and whole body vibration for the bin men.'My husband goes up on the farm equipment on the road, the previous bin men used it and other people seem to be fine on it. 'We . were very unhappy about it as we pay our council tax just like everyone . else, but wouldn’t get the same service. Our road is about three . quarters of a mile long, it’s a long way to drag a bin. In one road in St Andrews - Prior Letham Road - residents will have to hike 39 bins half-a-mile, to the road-end . 'There doesn’t seem to be any consistency either, other people who have bin collections on a different day to us, but on our road, were still getting the service. 'We would see bin lorries going passed our house, and further up the road for collection, but they said they couldn’t get ours. 'A lot of people who live on these roads are also very elderly, and they can’t be trekking bins about.'We had a meeting with the council yesterday and reached some solution, but it is only as we were very vocal about it.

Security: A 16-year-old Bangladeshi actress has been chosen to play Malala Yousafzai, pictured, in a new film about her extraordinary story . A 16-year-old Bangladeshi student has been chosen to play the role of Malala Yousafzai in a new film about the young activist who was shot by the Taliban. Fatima Sheikh, who has no acting experience, was selected by Indian director Amjad Khan to play the schoolgirl in an upcoming biopic which chronicles her extraordinary story. But the actress's parents, from Dhaka, are so terrified of revenge attacks by the Taliban they have insisted her face is not revealed until midway through filming. After weeks of feverish speculation, Khan gave way to pressure and revealed the girl's name to the Times of India. But the only picture to be released shows the student wearing a niqab with just a narrow slit for her eyes. No further picture or information about her will be revealed until filming is well underway. Malala Yousafzai has become a global icon following her heroic struggle for the rights of girls to be educated in Pakistan's Swat Valley which almost cost her her life. After the Taliban gained control of the area in 2007, she began writing a blog for the BBC under the pseudonym 'Gul Makai'. The terrorist militia operated a regime based on fear and imposed their will on residents by forcing men to grow beards, preventing women from going to the market and blowing up many schools - the majority for girls. Global icon: Malala was 14 when she was shot by the Taliban for speaking up for women's rights to education . Malala wrote about these practices in the journal when she was just 11. After the . Taliban were pushed out of the valley in 2009 by the Pakistani . military, she became even more outspoken in advocating for girls' education. She appeared frequently in the media and was given one of the country's highest honours for civilians for her bravery. In . October last year, a Taliban hitman burst onto her school bus in Swat, . northern Pakistan, and shot the 14-year-old at point-blank range. The bullet entered just above her left eye and ran along her jaw, 'grazing' her brain. It . was later removed by surgeons in Pakistan before she was flown to the . UK for specialist treatment at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Heroic struggle: Malala survived the assassination attempt and now lives in Birmingham with her family. She has been nominated for this year's Nobel Prize for Peace . Indian director Amjad Khan said he had to keep the name of the actress playing Malala secret until this point at her family's request . Malala's attempted assassination was condemned by politicians across the world and she was inundated with messages of support from members of the public and celebrities alike. She now attends Edgbaston High School in Birmingham and has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Amjad Khan said his film will be called 'Gul Makai' in reference to Malala's original blog and filming will take place in London, Pakistan, Iran and India. He said he located Fatima Sheikh through a friend and flew out to Dhaka to do a screen test. 'She is a student. She looks like Malala - but there are security issues,' he told The Independent. Filming is expected to start in the middle of July. Malala is due to publish an account of her life later this year entitle 'I am Malala'.","Bangladeshi schoolgirl Fatima Sheikh chosen for coveted role .

A 65-year-old man has died in France from a deadly new SARS-like virus which health officials are warning is now a global threat. The unnamed victim died at Hopital Roger Salengro in Lille after returning from a trip to Dubai in April. It brings the death toll from the strain of novel coronavirus to 24 out of 44 confirmed cases. Fatal: A 65-year-old man has died from a deadly new SARS-like virus at Hopital Roger Salengro in Lille, France . The man's hospital roommate also fell ill and remains isolated and in intensive care. The fatality comes as the World Health Organisation warned that the disease, first identified in humans in September, is now their greatest global concern. The strain is related to SARS, which killed some 800 people in a global epidemic in 2003. Dr. Margaret Chan, head of the WHO, singled out the illness in a speech on Monday in Geneva. 'We understand too little about this virus when viewed against the magnitude of its potential threat,' Chan said at the annual WHO meeting. 'We do not know where the virus hides in nature. We do not know how people are getting infected. Until we answer these questions, we are empty-handed when it comes to prevention. These are alarm bells. And we must respond.' She said the 'novel coronavirus... is a threat to the entire world.' Global threat: The strain of novel coronavirus has now killed 24 out of 44 confirmed cases worldwide . WHO said in an update earlier this month that 20 of the 40 confirmed cases of the disease have ended in death. Most of those infected since the virus was identified last year had traveled to Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan or Pakistan. There also have been cases in Britain and Germany. Saudi Arabia accounts for the majority of confirmed cases, which stands at 33, according to WHO officials. Tunisia last week became the ninth country in which the virus has been confirmed. It is believed the disease is transmitted mainly from person-to-person contact, but so far does not spread easily among larger communities. Authorities believe initial transmission of the virus was from animal to human but have yet to identify the animal sources. French authorities earlier this month began handing out leaflets at airports to travellers to the Middle East advising them to wash their hands frequently and limit contact with animals. The French victim had been in hospital for more than a month, spending the last 20 days in a room of the intensive care unit of the hospital where he was on life-support systems. Speaking about the death of the patient from the virus, French health minister Marisol Touraine said 'There is no cause for additional concern.'","Unnamed victim died from novel coronavirus at hospital in Lille, France .

Cllr David Carr, the Tory cabinet member for community safety on Medway Council in Kent, has been suspended from his new role for his comments, just days after being appointed. Cllr Carr, a former Mayor of Medway, said he was 'against freeloaders' and that travellers 'c****ed all over the place' turning wherever they brought their caravans into a 'building site'. In his first interview since being posted to the job - which puts him in charge of allocating new traveller sites - he told the Kent Messenger: 'They move on and turn it into a building site. 'They c*** all over the place, they p*** over the field, they throw rubbish all over the place.' He added: 'Are they just people who sit in a caravan and plant themselves wherever they see fit without paying council tax and without cleaning up after themselves? Should one develop a nice strategy for that? No. 'They live on the fringe of that. They take everything they can get and give very little back so I take a pretty hard line.

The aptly-named The Last Ball was arranged by a joint committee from Somerville and Jesus Colleges and charged £150 a ticket with around 1,000 people thought to have attended. 'Decadence': The Last Ball for Oxford University students had promised to be an extravagant event but turned out to be a farce . Their ambitious plans had already caused a stir when it emerged they included hosting a live shark in a tank at the event.

Earlier today Detective Superintendent Adrian McGee said the 17-year-old died from 'pressure to her neck'. A post-mortem examination found she had suffered 'strangulation' injuries probably caused by having a ligature wrapped around her throat. A West Mercia police spokesman added: 'The guidance being given is that she probably died as a result of strangulation injuries. 'This would be different to being 'strangled' which suggests someone putting their hands around her. 'It is likely a ligature of some sort was used.' Detectives also said Georgia's body had been formally identified, four days after she was found dead in woodland near Wrexham. The results of the post mortem examination were held at Wellington Civic Centre at the same time that her friend Jamie Reynolds appeared at court, charged with murder. The 22-year-old has yet to enter a plea and was remanded in custody until his next hearing on September 6. Wearing a yellow top with a green collar via prison video-link he spoke only to give his name, acknowledge the judge and to confirm that he understood proceedings. Speaking as Georgia's inquest was opened and adjourned, Detective Superintendent Adrian McGee said: 'I can now confirm that the body found in woodland off the Nant-y-Garth pass near Wrexham on Friday afternoon has been formally identified as that of 17-year-old Georgia Williams. 'Although we are not in a position to release any further details for legal reasons, and out of respect for the Williams family at this terribly sad time, I am also able to confirm that Georgia died as a result of pressure being applied to her neck.' Police arrested Reynolds in Glasgow last Wednesday and charged him with murder on Friday following the discovery of a body in woodland near Wrexham. Georgia, whose parents were not in court, went missing from her home in Wellington on Sunday, May 26. Jamie Reynolds, 22, from Wellington, appeared at Stafford Crown Court via video-link today . Detectives today renewed their appeal for members of the public to get in touch if they find the teenager's missing personal items, including her phone, jacket and make-up bag.

Devastated: Britain's Got Talent contestant Scott Whitley looked distraught when he did not make it to the live semi-finals stage . A contestant rejected by the Britain's Got Talent judges has claimed he tried to commit suicide after failing to make it to the semi-finals of the show. DJ Scott Whitley, from Orpington, Kent, was initially a favourite of Simon Cowell and his fellow judges with an energetic dance routine and singing he called Funkacise. The 30-year-old said he had built up his hopes of winning so much he gave up his job as an entertainer in Lanzarote. But he was left devastated when he failed to make the cut and attempted to take his own life while watching the live semi-final. 'I was really depressed and couldn't stop crying. I just had enough and took pills to try and end it all. Luckily I threw them up when I realised what I was doing,' he told The Daily Mirror. The entertainer admitted he been 'naive' to stake all his dreams of achieving fame and fortune with the show, but insisted he had been given the impression he was a 'cert' to get through to the next stage by prodcuers. Britain's Got Talent has come under increasing scrutiny this year with critics raising questions about the welfare of contestants who come under enormous pressure. Child welfare campaigners have also raised concerns about whether younger contestants are emotionally equipped to deal with possible rejection. One case which drew particular criticism was five-year-old Jordan Nash who progressed through the auditions. While the youngster, from London, . received positive comments from the judges, there were concerns that he . is too young to cope with fame, should he progress to the final stages . of the competition. Scott Whitley had thought he was a 'cert' to get through after his act went down well with hosts Ant and Dec . Singer Arisxandra Libantino, 11, . remains in the competition and will sing in front of millions next . weekend with £250,000 at stake. Arisxandra burst into tears of relief as she won a tense vote during Monday’s semi-final to go through to the last ten. But although she impressed the judges . with her powerful singing voice, psychologists, campaigners and viewers . all expressed concern that she wouldn’t be able to cope with the . disappointment if she lost in the final. It . comes only a few weeks after Strictly Come Dancing host Sir Bruce . Forsyth condemned talent shows for putting children through the ‘ordeal’ of competing. Britain’s . Got Talent judge Simon Cowell responded to those remarks after . Arisxandra’s performance on Monday, saying: ‘If you’ve got it, you’ve . got it. Who cares how old you are. You’re 11 years old. You’re having a . great time, right? Concerns have been raised about whether 11-year-old singer Arisxandra can cope with the pressure of Britain's Got Talent . In 2010 Shirlena Johnson was axed from the X Factor after she 'misled' producers over her mental illness. The . mother performed a bizarre version of Duffy's hit song Mercy on . Saturday's show, which saw her clawing at the floor and growling while . dressed in tight leopard skin leggings. But the giggling . panel sent her through to the next round, with Simon Cowell telling her: . 'I have never heard anything like that in my life. It was like a . musical exorcism. 'What I love about you is you are fantastically nuts.' But Miss Johnson, from East London, was later dropped  -  under rules . introduced by producers after Susan Boyle had a breakdown on Britain's .

Within 24 hours, police officers and TV producers had forcibly escorted her to The Priory clinic in north London.

Named HFLS3, it is 12.8 billion light-years from Earth - and is producing the equivalent of nearly 3,000 Suns per year. This makes it more than 2,000 times more prolific than our own Milky Way.

Top right is VLA spectrum showing radio emission from Carbon Monoxide molecules, which gave away its location . The team made the discovery in a galaxy so distant that they see it as it was when the universe was only six percent of its current age. Stars are born within dust clouds scattered through galaxies. Turbulence pushes gas and dust together, and the resulting knot begins to collapse under its own gravitational attraction. As it collapses, the material at the centre heats up and becomes a protostar - the hot core that will eventually become a star. The protostar gathers more dust and gas, though not all of it ends up part of the star. The 'leftovers' become planets, asteroids, comets... or just remain as dust. The galaxy is massive, with a huge reservoir of gas from which to form new stars. 'This is the most detailed look into the physical properties of such a distant galaxy ever made,' said Dominik Riechers, of Cornell University. 'Getting detailed information on galaxies like this is vitally important to understanding how galaxies, as well as groups and clusters of galaxies, formed in the early universe,' he added. To accurately determine the galaxy's distance and characteristics required observations with 12 international telescope facilities, including both orbiting and ground-based telescopes. The telescopes ranged from visible-light telescopes, to instruments working at infrared, millimeter-wave, and radio wavelengths. The National Science Foundation's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) provided information about cold molecular gas from which new stars are being formed and the radio waves emitted by the remnants of deceased, short-lived, very massive stars. The National Science Foundation's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) provided information about cold molecular gas from which new stars are being formed . The scientists found that the galaxy has a mass of stars nearly 40 billion times the mass of the Sun, and gas and dust totalling more than 100 billion times the mass of the Sun, all surrounded by enough mysterious dark matter to eventually build an entire cluster of galaxies. 'This galaxy is proof that very intense bursts of star formation existed only 880 million years after the Big Bang,' Riechers said. 'We've gotten a valuable look at a very important epoch in the development of the first galaxies,' he said. The Universe currently is about 13.7 billion years old. 'Key information about the massive amount of gas in this galaxy came from the VLA observations of radio emission from Carbon Monoxide,' said Chris Carilli, Chief Scientist of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, who was not part of the research team. 'The techniques used by this team, along with improved technical capabilities available now and coming in the future, will allow the study of more such galaxies, and provide a much better understanding of how the first galaxies formed during the Universe's youth,' Carilli added.

A mother of two who disappeared in 2002 and was declared legally dead in 2010 has been found alive in Florida, after she turned herself over to police. Brenda Heist was reported missing by her husband, Lee, on February 8, 2002. The 42-year-old had last been seen that morning dropping off her two children at school in Lititz, Pennsylvania. Her car was found a few days later with no apparent sign of a struggle. On Friday evening Heist walked into Monroe County Sheriff’s Office in Key Largo, Florida and announced who she was. Eleven years on the run: Brenda Heist pictured left at the time of her disappearance and right as she looked when she walked into a Florida police office last Friday . Brenda Heist walked out on this house in Lititz, Pennsylvania on February 8, 2002 that she shared with her husband Lee and two children . Heist has told detectives she left her family because she was in the . middle of a divorce and was struggling financially. She said the . pressure was too much and she snapped. She said she left Lititz after joining a group of homeless people that she met in a park who were hitch hiking to Florida. When she disappeared, Heist's daughter . was 8 and her son was 12. Her son recently graduated from West Chester . University and is applying to a police academy in New Jersey. Her . daughter is a sophomore at West Chester University. 'She said she thought of her family and her children every day, and her . parents. However, she never acted on that and never made any phone calls . – not one,' Lititz Police Detective John Schofield told 8WGAL. She told police that she had decided to turn herself in because she was at the end of her rope and that she was having health . problems. She now hopes to live with her mom in Texas. Former neighbor Arlene Bingeman said she couldn't believe Heist could have left her children for such a long time, while Detective Schofield noted that she had never tried to call home . 'I can't believe that she would leave her two children,' former neighbor Arlene Bingeman told 8WGAL. 'I just can't, as a mother, I just can't believe that.' After arriving in the Sunshine State, she had lived as a homeless person in the Key West area, sleeping under bridges and tents and eating food thrown out by fast food restaurants, police said. In all the years she was missing she never used a bank card or ID, even when she made some money cleaning boats. Local, state and federal authorities spent months investigating Heist's disappearance in 2002, interviewing dozens of relatives, friends, neighbors and co-workers. She was entered into several national missing persons databases. Her husband eventually collected her life insurance policy in 2010. Heist is being held in protective custody in Florida.

This is the shoddy work of a cowboy builder caught in a TV sting after tricking homeowners into handing over 90 per cent of the payment upfront - and then leaving before the job is done. John Guerin, 56, left dozens of homes across London in a 'state of ruin' and in need of emergency structural repairs over a five-year period in a £370,000 rip-off. Many of the homes he targeted were left with gaping holes in walls or with full skips in the driveway which had not been paid for. Shoddy: A house is left without a roof and the metal beam exposed after the conman fled from a half finished job . Bodged job: An uninhabitable room left abandoned after most of the money had been paid upfront . Others had to be re-wired or re-plumbed because they work was unsafe. At one property Guerin had fled with the roof uncovered after the old one had been stropped away - but before a new one had been fitted. In another instance, foundations were laid for an extension and the first few layers of bricks were laid before the conman fled. Some were left in such a dangerous condition they were in peril of collapsing and homeowners had to stump up tens of thousands to get professional builders in to complete the job before they could move back in. Poor workmanship: An example of the shoddy work carried out by jailed conman John Guerin . Many owners had to re-mortgage their homes in order to pay for builders to come in and fix Guerin's shoddy work. John Guerin was jailed for five years at Croydon Crown Court earlier this month after being found guilty of 10 charges of fraud and one of obtaining money by deception. The conman, from Biggin Hill, Kent, targeted vulnerable people and after starting work convinced customers to hand over as much cash as possible before he vanished. The deception - which happened between 2006 and 2010 - was exposed on Channel Five's Cowboy Builders. In total, cowboy builders rip off homeowners by a staggering £260m a year, a study has revealed. According to research done by the Federation of Master Builders (FMB), people who pay builders in cash lose the equivalent of £712,000-a-day in shoddy work, which then has to be repaired. Jailed conman: John Guerin who was given five years behind bars for carrying out the £370,000 fraud . Caught out: John Guerin, right, is confronted by TV presenter Dominic Littlewood as his scam comes undone on Cowboy Builders . A spokesman for the FMB, the largest trade association in the UK building industry with a membership of 12,000 building firms, said that paying for work in cash was ‘dangerous’. The research by the FMB showed that of the 1,000 people quizzed in the poll, a total of 11 per cent said they had ended up with shoddy workmanship which they then needed to get redone. Of that 11 per cent, 76 per cent had paid in cash - showing that using ready cash to pay builders was more likely to lead to poor quality work. Brian Berry, spokesperson for the FMB, said today: 'Before employing a builder, it is vital to carry out checks to make sure you are using someone reputable, such as an FMB builder. 'Choosing your builder on price alone can be a false economy which may neither add value to your property nor make for a smooth building project.' Extension going nowhere: The first few layers of bricks had been made when Guerin abandoned this building site . George Clarke, the presenter of Restoration Man on Channel Four, said: 'If you pay a builder large amounts of cash upfront then you leave yourself vulnerable to them increasing the price or walking off the job half-way through and you don't have any warranty if it all goes wrong. 'By using a reputable builder, signing a contract, and organising staged payments with receipts, you will have recourse if it all goes wrong.' Many of Guerin's crimes took place in the London Borough of Bromley. After he was jailed, Bromley Borough Council released photos of some of his shoddy building work. The council said Guerin traded under a range of company names, including Bluewood Constructions Ltd, Greyfox Project Management and Merlyn Refurbishment Ltd, before he was snared. Rubbish job: A load of building waste left outside one house after work was left undone . Mess: A doorway has been cut out but left unfinished, rubble is piled up outside, wiring has not been done and the room, left, needs decoration . In one case, Guerin was asked to build an extension for a man suffering from Parkinson's disease, but left with the project in a 'total mess' after getting more than £20,000. Sentencing Guerin to five years in jail, Judge Heather Baucher said: 'It beggared belief that he would inflict such harm. 'Nothing will compensate the victims for the distress and misery caused.' The court heard how the total amount paid by victims was £370,000 - but that with the increased costs of getting the job done properly meant victims would be 'left considerably out of pocket'. Bromley Council added that it had made an application under the Proceeds of Crime Act to seize Guerin's assets. Councillor Tim Stevens said: 'We are delighted with the outcome of this case and the time is now conducting a financial investigation into any financial gains made so the council can seek to recover any sums that were overpaid. 'The outcome of this case sends out a very strong message that we will not tolerate criminals preying on Bromley residents and our trading standards team is doing everything humanly possible to make sure that the perpetrators of such crimes are brought to justice.' During his appearance on Cowboy Builders, Guerin was challenged by Mr Littlewood about the quality of his workmanship. The show is co-presented by former glamour model Melinda Messenger.

Rescue effort: The ducklings were picked out of the ground by RSPCA inspectors and Fire Brigade officers. They could be hear chirping from the roadside . Reaching out: The ducklings had no way out of the deep drain.

Three generations of the same family, including two grandparents with a combined age of 138, who brought an estimated £1 million of heroin into the West Country have been jailed. Cornish Grandparents Michael, 75, and Teresa Wood, 63, helped two of their three sons and their grandson run a heroin supply chain from Liverpool to Devon and Cornwall, which was disrupted by a lengthy and sophisticated police surveillance operation. It resulted in the couple being stopped as they drove from Torbay back to Bodmin with £50,000 worth of heroin in Mrs Wood's shopping bag alongside the Cornish pasties she had bought for their supper. They were jailed for six and four years respectively. Devon and Cornwall Police handout photo of grandparents Teresa Wood, 63, and Michael Wood, 75, who were arrested with £50,000 of heroin in the boot of their car alongside pasties they had bought for their dinner . A police search has been launched for one of the key men in the conspiracy who jumped bail a few days before he was due to join 15 others in the dock at Exeter Crown Court. Stephen Blundell, who was the initial mastermind behind the supply chain, is now on the run after Judge Francis Gilbert, QC, issued a warrant for his arrest. A police operation codenamed Raby spent two years tracking the movements of couriers as they made 40 trips from the North West to the South West. Drugs squad officers have no certain way of knowing how much was brought each time, but believe each consignment was worth about £25,000 at street prices, making a total of £1 million. Grandson Jake Wood, 24, (left) received four years and son Ivan Wood, 43, (right) received nine years in the culmination of an 18-month investigation, codenamed Operation Raby, that saw 39 people arrested, heroin with a street value of £125,000 confiscated and £20,000 cash seized . Calvin Woods, left, was jailed for six years today by a judge at Exeter Crown Court, after police found £50,000 of heroin stashed in his parents' car (right) Grandfather Michael Wood was watched as he made 14 trips from Bodmin to Torbay to pick up drugs and his wife was carrying half a kilogram, worth £50,000 when they were stopped as they left the resort, meaning he could have carried £700,000 worth in all. The police broke up the conspiracy twice but it was so profitable that it carried on under different leadership with control moving from one Liverpool family to another. Judge Gilbert praised the efforts of the police and forensic service as he handed down severe jail sentences on the conspirators, including five members of the Wood family who were jailed for 29 years and six months in total. In sentencing the Wood family, he said: 'Ivan, you had a leading . role in all three conspiracies, with the distribution in Bodmin being . organised by you. You continued to run it after the arrest of Paul . Corrigan in August 2010 and your parents in October of that year. 'Michael: you are 75 but were a very busy courier for your son, making . some 14 trips to Torbay in three months. 'Teresa: you played a lesser . role but the text messages you sent and received showed you were fully . aware of what was going on. 'Jake: you are 24 and played a lesser role. Calvin: your role was significant but I assess it as lesser than your brother."" The main organiser in Torbay, Mark Gale (left), aged 41, of Torquay, was jailed for eight years, while one of the gang leaders Craig Corrigan (right) aged 23, was jailed for nine years . Couriers Keith Anderson (left), 30, and John Pogue (right), 27, received . six years for their role in the plan to flood the West Country with the . deadly class A . Mr Ray Tully, prosecuting, said the drugs supply chain stretched from . Liverpool to Torbay at first with drugs being moved on to Bodmin. He said the initial organiser was Liverpool-based Steven Blundell, who . was helped by his cousin Paul and used Torbay resident Mark Gale as his . local coordinator.

Stuart Worvell was convicted of manslaughter for the killing of 20-year-old Thomas Sutton, who mistook Worvell's house for the venue of a party. Cardiff Crown Court heard that Worvell was playing loud music and taking a bath when Mr Sutton and his friend Kyle Harris, 18, presumed there was a party in his house. The 22-year-old, known as Womble, stabbed the pair with a six-inch kitchen knife after they argued on his doorstep near Bridgend, south Wales. He claims he acted in self-defense because the men were armed with wooden stakes. Mr Sutton was stabbed nine times and is believed to have died within minutes. Mr Harris was seriously injured after being stabbed three times. Judge Mr Justice Wyn Williams KT told .

The programme screened on Monday evening features commentary by the Queen’s staff, past and present, involved with the training and welfare of her horses and ponies which number around 180 and are kept at various royal residences and stables from Sandringham to Balmoral. Talking about the Queen’s love of horses are her granddaughter Zara Phillips, racing adviser John Warren, Joe Grimwade, manager of the Royal Studs and her cousin Margaret Rhodes. The Princess Royal speaks at length about being knocked unconscious when her horse fell during the Montreal Olympic Games in 1976.

'But I think with horses it’s another world in that it reduces you to just the person in relation to the animal, and you’re not a Queen, you’re just a human being.' From early childhood the Queen was surrounded by horses and relatives who owned, rode and talked about them. Her first reported riding lesson took place in the private riding school at Buckingham Palace Mews in January 1930, when she was still only three years old. When she was five, the Queen Mother led her on Peggy, a Shetland pony given to her when she was four by King George V, to a meet of the Pytchley Hounds at Boughton Cover.

The controversy surrounding why Neil Armstrong's famous moon quote was misheard by millions of people worldwide may have been less to do with dodgy recording equipment and more to do with his unique Ohio accent. When Armstrong walked on the moon the . astronaut claimed to have said: 'That's one small step for a man, . one giant leap for mankind', but most listeners claim they can't hear the first 'a' and the statement has become best known without it. Poor recording equipment was previously blamed for the mishearing, yet linguistic experts now claim a unique feature of Armstrong's Ohio accent could be to blame. During the moon landing of 1969, Neil Armstrong was recorded by Nasa as saying: 'That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.' However, many people claim they can't hear Armstrong's 'a' in the recording and the quote has become famous with it missing. This mishearing was initially blamed on poor recording equipment, yet speech scientists from Michigan and Ohio claim it could have been caused by the way Armstrong's accent made him blend his words . US astronaut Neil Armstrong always stood by the fact he said 'for a' and not 'for' in his famous moon landing quote from the Apollo 11 mission in 1969 . Speech scientists from Michigan State University and Ohio State University analysed the clip and studied how speakers from his native central Ohio pronounce 'for' and 'for a'. The team suggest that in the midwestern American state Ohio there is typically a lot of blending between words such as 'for' and 'a.' And these results suggest it's entirely possible that Armstrong said what he claimed, even though people are statistically more likely to hear 'for man' instead of 'for a man' on the recording. Dr Laura Dilley of Michigan State, said: 'Prior acoustic analyses of Neil Armstrong's recording have established well that if the word 'a' was spoken, it was very short and was fully blended acoustically with the preceding word.' 'If Armstrong actually did say 'a', it sounded something like ""frrr(uh).' 'His blending of the two words, compounded with the poor sound quality of the transmission, has made it difficult for people to corroborate his claim that the 'a' is there.' Dilley and her colleagues carried out a statistical analysis of the duration of the 'r' sound as spoken by native central Ohioans saying 'for' and 'for a' in natural conversation. When Neil Armstrong listened back to the recordings of his famous moon quote, he admitted that he hadn't heard himself say the 'a' either but insists he did actually say the often misheard words . In 2006, a computer analysis found evidence that Armstrong said what he said he said. Peter Shann Ford, an Australian computer programmer, ran a software analysis looking at sound waves and found a wave that would have been the missing 'a'. It lasted 35 milliseconds, much too quick to be heard. The Smithsonian's space curator, Roger Launius, looked at the evidence and found it convincing. NASA has also stood by its moon man. 'If Neil Armstrong says there was an 'a,' then as far as we're concerned, there was 'a,'' NASA spokesman Michael Cabbage said shortly before the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission. Armstrong died in August last year, aged 82, and maintained until the end that there was a lost word in his famous words from the moon. They used a collection of recordings of conversational speech from 40 people raised in Columbus, Ohio, near Armstrong's native town of Wapakoneta. Within these recordings they found 191 cases of 'for a.' They then matched each of these to an instance of 'for' as said by the same speaker and compared the relative duration. They also examined the duration of Armstrong's 'for (a') from Nasa's lunar transmission. They discovered a large overlap between the relative duration of the 'r' sound in 'for' and 'for a' using the Ohio speech data. The duration of the 'frrr(uh)' in Armstrong's recording was 0.127 seconds, which falls into the middle of this overlap, though it is a slightly better match for when the 'a' is missing. This means that the quotation is . compatible with either possible interpretation but the researchers . accept it is slightly more likely to be perceived as 'for', . regardless of what Armstrong actually said. In 2006, computer analysis found evidence that Armstrong said what he said he said and this may have been backed up by a linguistics study by speech scientists at Michigan State and Ohio State University. They analysed his famous quote and the accents of 40 other people who grew up in the same state as Armstrong . Dr Dilley says there may have been a 'perfect storm of conditions' for the word 'a' to have been spoken but not heard. She said: 'We've bolstered Neil Armstrong's side of the story. 'We feel we've partially vindicated him. 'But we'll most likely never know for sure exactly what he said based on the acoustic information.' She said that the work has implications beyond Armstrong's timeless quotation. Dilley added: 'Every time we listen to speech and think we understand a . sentence, we are performing a miraculous task, which is to take what is . actually a continuous acoustic signal, break up that signal into . somewhat arbitrary parts, and map those parts to our memories of all the . words that we know in the language. 'We . need only look at computer speech recognition and how it succeeds and . how it largely often fails to see how very difficult that problem is.' Astronaut Neil Armstrong died last August aged 82. He maintained until the end that there was a lost word in his famous words from the moon . Dilley and her team's findings will be presented at the 21st International Congress on Acoustics in Montreal. In 2006, computer analysis similarly found evidence that Armstrong . said what he said he said. Peter Shann Ford, an Australian computer programmer, ran a . software analysis looking at sound waves and found a wave that would have been . the missing 'a'. It lasted 35 milliseconds, much too quick to be heard. Neil Armstrong was born in Wapakoneta in the midwestern American state of Ohio. Speech scientists found that people from this region blend their words and this could be the reason why the 'a' is so often misheard in Armstrong's famous moon quote . The . Smithsonian's space curator, Roger Launius, looked at the evidence and found it . convincing and Nasa also stood by its moon man.

She is married to businessman Djiwonou Djogbessi, 38, and has a 50 per . cent share in his online fashion business, but told The Sunday Times . that while he ‘helps a lot’, she does not live with him. After failing in a High Court attempt to keep her housing benefit claim . secret, she told the newspaper that she needed to be housed in Belgravia . at public expense so that her children can continue to attend their . top-rated state primary school, and she can continue her course at . Westminster University. She claimed she was having to travel for two hours on the bus with her . children to and from school. They do not take the Tube, although it is . often quicker. Her children are understood to be aged between one and ten. Four attend . the primary school in Belgravia with a fifth set to start there in . September. Miss Demouh, who is British, but was born in Togo, West Africa, said: . ‘My children are suffering because they are overtired all the time. They . can’t do their homework, they fall asleep on their way home. ‘When they get home they can’t eat their dinner because they are too . tired. The youngest are getting sick the whole time. I am saying the . primary school is a very good school – it is close to private . education.’ Relocated: Stephanie Demouh was forced to move out of a £2million house near Sloane Square . Asked why she was complaining about the ten-mile commute when others, . many of whom do not qualify for housing benefit, travel further every . day, Miss Demouh said: ‘I don’t have a problem with where I live other . than the location. ‘It is just the long distance from the children’s school, and I can’t . change my place of study. If you have to attend a nine o’clock lecture, . you can’t be at both places together.’ Miss Demouh said she and her children had been on a six-week holiday to . Togo last year, but said a cousin paid for the air fares. Her husband joined them halfway through the holiday she said, but . stressed that he did not live with  her. Housing benefit payouts are . less likely if a wage-earning husband is living in the same house as a . mother. Miss Demouh claimed her temporary accommodation in Edgware was more . expensive than the Belgravia townhouse and added: ‘I don’t think I have . committed a crime by trying to protect my family.’ A former neighbour of Miss Demouh in Belgravia told the Daily Mail he . was disgusted by her quest for more public money to be spent on . rehousing her there, saying: ‘It’s entirely unfair and completely . ludicrous. ‘Why should I save up and work hard all my life to own a property that . I’m proud of when she can just come and live here for free?’ Westminster city council cabinet minister for housing, Jonathan Glanz, . said last night that Miss Demouh’s case was being investigated by its . fraud team. He said: ‘This investigation is ongoing, so we cannot comment on the . specific details. Westminster city council are committed to ensuring . that homes and taxpayers’ money are used to help only those in genuine . need and will not tolerate people “playing the system” to their own . benefit.’","Stephanie Demouh was entitled to housing benefit because she was registered as a single mother .

Assassinated: 32-year-old Ali Armagan was shot at six times while he was parked outside at tube station. No one has been convicted of his murder . Three men who helped set up the murder of their rival gang's leader in a revenge attack were jailed today. 32-year-old Ali Armagan, who led a North London Turkish gang was shot outside a tube station by members of the 'Tottenham Boys'. Minicab driver Suleyman Tonbul, 54, his 26-year-old . son Hasan and Mehmet Senel, 24, tipped off their gang's leader after seeing Mr Armagan in his car. Half an hour later, Mr Armagan was shot dead. The underworld drug boss' assassination was the third in a series of five murders linked to the bloody feud between the Bombacilar, or Hackney Turks, and the Tottenham Boys, or Tottenham Turks. Senel and the Tonbuls were . charged with conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm on the basis . that they expected Ali Armagan to be beaten up but not shot. 26-year-old Hassan . Tonbul was on parole at the time of the killing in February 2012. He had served an 18 month sentence for attacking a cafe owner in Tottenham . with a meat cleaver. He was also under an ASBO banning him from contacting members of the Tottenham Turks. His father, who spotted Ali Armagan while driving his minicab is said to be a well-respected member of the Turkish community and has no previous convictions. Judge Anthony Morris QC sentenced Suleyman Tonbul to eight years, Hassan Tonbul to 11 years and Senel to ten years at the Old Bailey. Prosecutor William Emlyn Jones told the . Old Bailey: 'The killing took . place against the background of a long running feud between two Turkish . drug gangs operating in north London. 'On . any view this was a particularly bloodthirsty feud. 'It is wholly . unacceptable that the streets of our city have become a battleground . between these two gangs with the risk of innocent members of the public . being injured or killed.' Suleyman Tonbul spotted Mr Armagan's distinctive Audi while driving in the Tottenham area. He made three phone calls to his son, who was with Mehmet Senel. The men are said to have passed the message on to Kemel Eren and his right hand man Omar Murat, who are believed to have gone straight to the scene in Turnpike . Lane. Six shots were fired at Mr Armagan's car. Scene of crime: 54-year-old Suleyman Tonbul spotted Ali Armagan's distinctive Audi. He was shot outside Turnpike tube station half an hour later . Old Bailey: The three men were jailed for conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm because they thought Ali Armagan would be beaten up when they told gang members about his whereabouts . Only six weeks ago one of the leading members of the Tottenham Turks, Zafer Eren, was shot dead in Southgate, north London. There have also been nearly 30 other incidents involving attempted murder, beatings, arson attacks and threats of violence. Nobody . has been convicted of the murder of Ali Armagan but the court heard the . two gunmen are believed to be Kemel Eren, the head of the Tottenham . Turks, and his right hand man Omar Murat. After . the killing Kemel Eren - nicknamed 'No Fingers' - fled to Turkey and . was himself shot in December last year and left wheelchair bound. The background to the murder of Ali Armagan can be traced back a brawl at a the Manor Club in Finsbury Park, north London, on 24 January 2009. Kemal Armagan, Ali's Brother, was injured in the fight and vowed to kill anyone who attacked him, including Mehmet Senpalit, a Tottenham Turk.","Feud between London gangs 'Tottenham Boys' and 'Bombacilar' led to five deaths in past four years .

Stylishly single: Joos chose not to wear a summer dress because it was 'freezing' A casting agent for Vogue has opened up about how her date, a 49-year-old Goldman Sachs lawyer, told her that she wasn't showing enough skin. He said 'you should have worn a skirt,' she writes on her blog Tales of Endearment. 'This wasn't meant as a joke. He continued to complain about my lack of skin until we left the restaurant.' According to her date, wearing a short skirt was 'the only way to tell the guy is a ""James . Bond""' because 'if he can keep his cool while you're sitting there . flaunting your goods, he's a real man.' Joos' story should be viewed as a cautionary tale about how differently men and women view first date attire. Like Joos, many women go into dates with a feeling of being 'helpless and desperate to please.' This is why we change outfits six times to . unearth the ideal combination classy and sexy. But for most men, the only accessories that matter are cleavage and a smile. Working in fashion presents Joos with an additional set of challenges: 'I'm not used to dressing for straight . men,' she explains. 'Everyone's either gay or a woman. And the rare . straight man who does loiter around in the colorful corridors of the . fashion industry chases models for sport. So I dress for myself and . other girls.' We have our go-to body armor - mine is a  Helmut Lang dress that is long enough for work but shows . cleavage with my jacket off. But as a freelance writer, my outfits often . depend on my assignments. After writing an article on the super-short skirt trend, I showed up . to my date straight from the photo shoot in a neon yellow Christopher Kane micro mini with five-inch . heels - only to have my date joke that I looked 'like Big Bird'. Another . guy told me me point-blank that he 'hated' the large bow on my blouse, . and a third called my Christian Louboutin purple ankle boots 'an abortion'. Stepping out: Casting agent and fashion blogger Natalie Joos says that she feels 'helpless and desperate to please' when deciding what to wear on a first date . Joos was wearing 'a tiny . Peter . Pilotto shirt that bared my arms and shoulders quite generously' adding, . 'really isn’t that the only thing you can see when you’re across from . someone at a table?' Unfairly judged: Catherine Townsend (pictured with her husband) wore a neon yellow mini skirt on a date - and the guy joked she looked 'like Big Bird' She adds that she was 'freezing', so wearing a skirt wasn't very practical. Fashion magazines don't usually . cover 'stilettos that won't get stuck in subway escalators' or ' slits that won't fly up to expose your underwear to construction workers.' Still she wondered if she made the . right call. 'Was I wrong to wear pants? Was I wrong to assume I would . come off as slutty or too eager if I wore a short skirt?' she asks. Her date, who argued that '99per cent of men would say they prefer a skirt over pants' would say yes. To investigate, Joos 'stopped a few . guys around the West Village and asked them if it was suitable for a . first date, or if they would have preferred to see a skirt instead.' Among this (perhaps slightly biased) demographic, she says 'the answers were all in my favor.' Sometimes, however, men are being . self-conscious rather than sexist. A lot of guys, especaily those who . work in competitive industries, are used to teasing their friends and . may be cracking a joke to break the ice. My husband asked me 'Have you ever considered getting breast implants?' on one of our very first dates. The right to bare arms: For her date Joos chose a tiny Peter Pilotto shirt . Instead of taking it personally, I smiled and said 'have you ever considered getting a penis implant?' He never brought it up again.","Natalie Joos relates the experience with a 49-year-old lawyer on her blog .

'The whole thing has been ridiculous, there needs to be some kind of inquiry into how these councils are acting. 'I had someone come round last .

Magistrates Court for deliberately preventing work from being carried . out. She was ordered to pay £2,000 court costs . and a £15 victim surcharge. She was given 28 days . to cut the hedge or risk further legal action which could include being . slapped with an ASBO. Miss Spiers said: 'The council claim they are a hedge . which are subject to height restrictions but I maintain they are trees . which do not need to be cut. 'The thing is the trees don't even . boarder my neighbour's garden and they have never been cut into a hedge . so shouldn't be classed as such. Graeme Duerden, Development Control .

Swapping a sharp suit for a prison-issue jacket, Huhne is pictured here for the first time in the low-security Leyhill Prison in Gloucestershire. Bright and breezy: Disgraced former Cabinet minister Chris Huhne pictured for the first time walking in the grounds of Leyhill prison in Gloucester . Perhaps it’s no wonder he’s all breezy smiles. The open prison was once dubbed ‘the Savoy of Slammers’ because of its easy-going regime. The multi-millionaire is at the start of an eight-month sentence for perverting the course of justice when his ex-wife took speeding points for him ten years ago. As onlookers watched from a public footpath skirting the prison yesterday morning, Huhne, 58, could be seen sauntering around with his hands in his jeans pockets. Grim-faced: The former Energy Secretary was paid a visit by his partner Carina Trimingham on Saturday . After an evidently satisfying breakfast, he strolled back to his accommodation block, chatting to fellow inmates with the same ease he once employed when winning over potential allies in the corridors of the House of Commons. Huhne’s motoring offence fraud unravelled after he left his economist wife Vicky Pryce, 60, for his aide Carina Trimingham, 45. Embittered Pryce leaked the story to journalists, and both she and her husband have ended up inside – with both being moved to open prisons within weeks of being sentenced on March 11.

A 38-year-old Dutch man killed a grandmother in a head-on collision while driving on the wrong side of the road. Michel Vandenburgt had reverted to driving on his 'normal' side of the road for a minute before he crashed into Jacqueline Emmott, who was driving in the right direction in the same lane. Bradford Crown Court today heard that Mr Vanderburgt had been driving his Opal Astra in the wrong lane in West Yorkshire when he crashed into Jacqueline Emmott, 67. Bradford Crown Court today heard that Michael Vandenburgt's (left) driving fell 'not far short' of dangerous when he drove on the wrong side of the road, killing retired police welfare officer, Jacqueline Emmott, 67. Mrs Emmott died at the scene from head . and abdominal injuries and her husband Tony, who was driving the car last September, is still receiving treatment for his injuries. Judge Robert Bartfield said that Mr Vandenburgt fell 'not far short' of dangerous driving. The judge suspended his six-month prison sentence for 12 months, telling him he did not think a few weeks in jail would do 'any good'. Mr Vanderburgt was also given a 12-month driving ban, but this does not apply in the Netherlands. He was ordered to pay £500 towards court costs. He had pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving at an earlier hearing at Ilkley and Bingley Magistrates Court. Mr Vanderburgt was visiting Yorkshire with his wife Sally, whose family live here. After leaving Mrs Vanderburgt's sister's home in Ilkley, the couple drove towards Hull, using Sat Nav directions. Judge Bartfield said the Sat Nav 'may have distracted' him. 'Whether it did or not you took up the wrong carriageway, driving on the right hand side of the road which investigations show you did for something like 60 seconds,' he said. 'I have concluded that you must have set off and reverted to your normal direction of travel.' Mr Vanderburgt (pictured) arrived for sentencing at Bradofrd Crown Court today. He had pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving at a previous hearing and was today ordered to pay £500 towards court costs . The court heard that Vanderburgt did not see markings on the 50mph road, which would have appeared upside down to someone travelling in the wrong direction. He drove in the rain for around half-a-mile down what the judge called a 'narrow, lonely piece of road with little traffic on it at that time'. Investigations showed that Mr Vanderburgt was travelling about 33mph, while Mr Emmott was driving between 25 and 30mph. The cars collided on a bend in the road. Retired police welfare officer Mrs Emmott suffered injuries to her head and abdomen. Vanderburgt suffered various wounds and bruising, and had to stay in hospital for three days. His wife also suffered wounds and bruising. Judge Bartfield said, 'The reality of this was that this was a much loved wife, mother and grandmother, retired for only one month. 'Her family are completely devastated by the loss of this remarkable lady. 'In a victim impact statement, her daughter Josephine's desperate wish is for her back but that can never be. 'You have to accept your responsibility because had you concentrated on what you were doing instead of being distracted by something else, this would not have happened. 'You will wake up every day and when you open your eyes you will have a recollection of what you have done. 'That will be your greatest punishment. I'm satisfied your remorse is genuine.' The court that Mr Vanderburgt is a ""decent, hard-working, family man"", who was ""mortified"" by the accident. Road Safety Charity Brake criticised the sentence following the case. Senior campaigns officer Ellen Booth said: 'This sentence does seem to be on the low side of the sentencing options a judge has when facing a charge of death by careless driving. 'We have to send out the right message to other drivers that if you kill or seriously injure someone through bad driving you can expect really serious consequences, so that members of the public do take their responsibilities as a driver very seriously.'","Michael Vandenburgt, 38 drove in right-hand lane for 60 seconds before crashed into Jacqueline Emmott, 67 .

With the nation edging towards an obesity epidemic, some health professionals are resorting to shock tactics in an attempt to convince people to eat healthier. One government health agency in California set out to warn of the dangers of sugary drinks by reaching out to parents and educating them about proper nutrition. However some have suggested this time the agency First 5, went too far by using Photoshop to make a perfectly healthy child look obese. Supersize me: The image on the left is an original photo of the little girl on First 5's website. The image is on the right is what appears on posters around California . Although the intentions to 'nurture and protect our most precious resource — our children' were noble, the poster is now on display all over the state of California and drawing criticism from many quarters. The two were placed side by side by author Marilyn Wann, who wrote the book 'FAT!SO? : Because You Don’t Have to Apologize for Your Size' - she believes in a Health at Every Size approach. Wann placed the two photos on her Facebook demanding 'children deserve to be protected from this kind of damaging fearmongering. (And from creepy Photoshopping!).' 'It was so mindblowingly hateful that I Photoshopped them together and posted them on Facebook and on Tumblr,' Wann said. Obesity epidemic: Nationally, some 15 percent of children are overweight or obese, as are some 60 percent of adults . Opinions: Health officials say the use of shocking pictures does not work whilst ad agencies like First 5 tend to veer towards impactful images . Divisive: Whilst a picture of an obese child may suit an ad agency looking to get a message across, health officials say such shock tactics have no impact in reality . 'Hate messages are bad for public health. Children of all sizes deserve to be valued as they are and supported in eating and exercising, because these behaviors are fun, feel good, and are good for health. No shame or blame!' The ad-agency, First 5 has refused to apologise for the doctoring of the photos. Although the agency has worked on anti-obesity campaigns for years, this is the first time the program has Photoshopped images of kids to make them appear bigger than they normally are. The aim of the campaign is to fight childhood obesity using the image of a chubby little girl drinking a bag of sugar through a straw. The caption reads: 'Sugary drinks like juice, sports drinks and soda can cause obesity. Choose milk and water instead.' 'The ad was intended to show parents the real-life consequences of obesity and what sugar can do to our children’s lives,' said spokeswoman Lindsay Van Laningham. 'They are just stock images which were Photoshopped,' she said. 'When you are handing a child soda or a juice box to drink you might as well be handing them a packet of sugar. Because that's what happening.' Such Photoshop manipulation occurs despite experts continually pointing out that using images of overweight kids is ineffective. Childhood obesity prevention researcher Marsha Davis said making people feel badly about their weight does not lead to change. 'We need to fight obesity... not obese people,' she said.","Agency took stock photo of girl then used Photoshop to make her look fat .

Cuocolo is a divorced mother of three who works at the IRS. Her fascination with Engine Co. 26 and Engine Co. 65 started off innocently enough. She was a member of several online support groups dedicated to the FDNY. Support FDNY, FDNY Midtown, and NYC Fire Wire - all on Facebook - are examples of the kind of firefighter support pages Cuocolo would frequent. Firefighter fever: Engine 26 in Midtown Manhattan was one of the companies terrorized by Cuocolo, a so-called firefighter 'buff' But Cuocolo started to worry the firefighters when she showed up at the firehouses with baked goods, memorial plaques and flowers - something that is not allowed. Visitors are only allowed inside the firehouses during open houses. 'Some mistake our niceness for something more than it is,' one firefighter told the Post. 'Some people don't realize it's a job. They think it's our job to entertain them. These people are interfering.' He said that popular TV shows such as 'Rescue Me' and 'Backdraft' paint a false image of what firehouse life is really like - with private affairs happening inside the firehouse itself. Cuocolo seems to be one of those people. Cuocolo told the Post she would bring plates of cookies to 'show support because I respect them.' Her aim was to catch the eye of one of the firemen, acknowledging that she had crushes on a few men at Engine 65. Crush: Cuocolo admitted wanting to date a few of the men at Engine 65. She is a divorced mother of three . 'Yeah I did at one time. It was a couple [firefighters]. I don't remember who right now,' Cuocolo said. When firefighters told her she had to stop showing up at the house, Cuocolo got nasty. She posted pictures of firefighters' families online and sent text messages to other buffs talking smack about specific firefighters.'Im so sick of 65 house and tommy danny chris i want to shove a halligan up each of there asses,' she wrote in one text message to fellow buss Joni Heiden, who administers a few buff Facebook pages. A halligan is a tool firefighters use to pry open doors. A January 2 post on the NYPD Chicky page showed an image of a Engine 65  truck with the letters 'F U' seemingly Photoshopped on the windshield. Rebuffed: When Cuocolo was told to stop showing up at the firehouse, she didn't react too well. A picture was posted on the FDNY Chicky page on January 2 with the letters ' F U' scrawled on the windshield of a Engine 65 truck . The situation drew the attention of the NYPD and State Police when Engine 65 was threatened. On April 23 a post was put up on Indiana buff Scott Main's Facebook page which read: 'i enjoy threating firefighter lifes the most import is i take out every fdny firefighter im going to start with 65 house.' A 'pipe bomb' was mentioned in another post. No badge bunnies allowed: A recent post on the FDNY Midtown Facebook page proposed a crack-down on any other 'badge bunnies.' The FDNY and NYPD asked several of the groups to take Cuocolo off their pages . Main was a former boyfriend of Cuocolo's, but their relationship ended badly when she found out he wasn't an actual firefighter. 'He had the gear to prove it,' Cuocolo said. There are even pictures of her posing in firefighter clothing. But apparently, Main just grabbed them from a dumpster. 'He pretended to be a firefighter. He never was one.' When they broke-up, Cuocolo gave his Facebook login information to Gary Battista, another buff, who wanted to get back at Main for allegedly beating Cuocolo. Battista was charged last month with making terroristic threats and computer trespass. He admitted to hacking Main's facebook page and spent one month in upstate Monroe County Jail.  Cuocolo admitted that she gave Battista Main's login information, but says she didn't know about the threatening post. Cuocolo is no longer allowed at the firehouses. Most of the men just feel bad for her. 'I think she's just a person who needs come help. She is not very mature and is easily manipulated,' one firefighter said.","Divorced mother of three, Christine Cuocolo, brought baked goods to local companies, and admits having crushes on a few firemen .

Former Massachusetts Governor Argeo Paul Cellucci died yesterday following a two-year battle with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's Disease. A Republican, Cellucci served one full term as governor before resigning to accept a position as the U.S. ambassador to Canada under former President George W. Bush. Prior to his term as governor, Cellucci served in both the Massachusetts House of Representatives and Senate before being elected lieutenant governor in 1991. 'Rock-hard integrity': former Massachusetts Governor Argeo Paul Cellucci died yesterday. He was 65 . Cellucci served as lieutenant governor for six years until, in 1997, then-governor William Weld resigned to pursue an ambassadorship to Mexico after being appointed by former President Bill Clinton. Weld was never confirmed for the post. As governor, Cellucci was a fiscal Conservative while remaining somewhat middle-of-the-road on social issues. In 2001, the Libertarian-leaning Cato Institute gave Cellucci an 'A' rating as governor, noting that he 'earned the distinction of having the best record of reducing taxes and restraining spending growth' amongst the nation's 50 governors. Cellucci supported Roe V. Wade, which often found him at odds with the Catholic Church - while lieutenant governor, Cardinal Bernard Law cited his position on the controversial abortion law when he uninvited him to speak at Hudson Catholic High Schol, his alma mater. Despite being a Republican, Cellucci signed into law one of the strictest gun bills in the nation. Cellucci oversaw part of the controversial 'Big Dig' project in Boston, which, at an estimated $22 billion, is the most expensive highway project in U.S. history and resulted in one death, multiple criminal arrests and nearly $500 million in restitution from the project's consortium and other companies involved in its construction. Big Disappointment: Cellucci oversaw Boston's controversial 'Big Dig,' the most expensive highway project in U.S. history . In 2003, while serving as ambassador to Canada, Cellucci criticized Canadian opposition to the war in Iraq, saying that the U.S. would 'never hesitate' to support Canada if it faced a security threat. The comments were front-page news in Canada, and prompted Canadian columnist Mel Hurtig to charge Cellucci with being 'ill-mannered, obnoxious [and] arrogant.' Upon hearing of his death, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick issued a statement saying 'Massachusetts lost a favored son and devoted public servant today. A . lawyer, legislator, governor and diplomat, Paul Cellucci was also a kind . man and a friend.' Former Governor Weld also issued a statement about his former lieutenant governor. 'Paul Cellucci was simply one of the finest human beings I have ever met. I happened to know him in the realm of politics and government, but . anyone who knew him in any other arena would have found the same man: a . person of rock-hard integrity, keen intelligence, considerable humor, . abundant compassion, and deep devotion to family and country. We are all . immensely impoverished by his loss,' Weld said. Former Massachusetts Governor and 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney took to Twitter to offer his condolences. 'Ann and I are saddened by the loss of our friend Gov. Paul Cellucci. Our hearts and prayers are with Jan and the Cellucci family,' Romney tweeted.","Cellucci served as ambassador to Canada .

A woman who found a disemboweled and headless Chihuahua in her car on Thursday morning believes she was targeted by boys she had brawled with. Ashley Immel called police when she discovered the decapitated dog on the driver's seat of her black Honda sedan in the driveway of her Knights Landing, California, home. 'It was like properly placed there for it to be seen like here you go look at this,' the 20-year-old told News10. She said the dog appeared to be mutilated with a sharp object like a knife. Immel said this was the second time parts of a canine were dumped on her 4th Street property. Two weeks ago, she spotted the head of a terrier inside her boat, but she only reported it on Thursday after the second attack. The dogs did not belong to her. Immel, who drives trucks according to her Facebook page, told News10 she thinks fights in her past have come back to haunt her. 'No one likes to get beat up by a girl,' she said.

A golfer's idea of a hole-in-one quickly got out of hand when one player stabbed another with a broken golf club. Police say the pair were on the 12th hole at Westwynd Golf Course in Oakland County near Detroit, Michigan when the duo got into an argument about the score. 59-year-old Glen Lott broke his Callaway 5-iron on the arm of his 65-year-old partner. Lott was arraigned on Friday in Rochester Hills District Court and ordered as part of his $100,000 bond to stay away from the golf course.

Lott, a former Drake University football star, drove off in his car but was later taken into custody. He has now been arraigned on $100,000 bail and is scheduled to appear in court next Tuesday.

'It was group of 20 friends — or maybe former friends now — or maybe they used to be coworkers who have a travel league,' Mehlberg said, adding that the all-men’s group had played the course twice last year and once so far this year. He called violence on the green 'pretty rare,' adding, 'It was a crazy day. I’ve worked at a golf course for 12 years and nothing like this ever happened.'The victim was treated and received multiple stitches in his arm after being stabbed with the jagged edge of the broken club.

But the snaps Monica Bounds brought back from a £900 ‘world class cruise’ were images she would much rather forget. While the brochures boast you can ‘indulge in escapism’ as friendly staff ‘do their utmost to make every part of your cruise experience special’, the reality was a holiday from hell. Illness: Monica Bounds, 61, right, documented her 'holiday from hell' with friend Veronica Godfrey on a cruise around the Med on a ship which was overrun with norovirus . According to Mrs Bounds, 61, the luxury liner Boudicca was effectively a ‘plague ship’ riddled with norovirus, which left numerous passengers ‘quarantined’ in cabins as crew wore masks and nuclear disaster-style suits. She claims staff were secretly placed on a ‘Code Red’ warning that forbade them to touch passengers. Many guests spent the trip suffering from vomiting and diarrhoea, she said. According to operator Fred Olsen cruise lines, 61 of 732 passengers became ill with the highly contagious virus – more than 8 per cent. Mrs Bounds spent much of her ten-day cruise isolated in her cabin, where seriously ill friend Veronica Godfrey was on two drips hooked over a coathanger and hanging from a porthole. Mrs Bounds claims Fred Olsen knew there were problems with infection, but failed to clean satisfactorily. And just hours after the retired nurse arrived back in Portsmouth last  Saturday the ship sailed again with 800 new passengers, she said. Behind closed doors: Crew wore protective clothes and 'were not allowed to touch passengers' according to Mrs Bounds . Three years ago the law firm Irwin Mitchell, representing 85 passengers, questioned whether Boudicca should remain in service – claiming it had five norovirus outbreaks in 18 months. Mrs Bounds, who lives with husband Mike, 62, in Dingestow, Monmouthshire, said: ‘It was like a plague ship. ‘I barely went out of my cabin because I was confined there with my friend Veronica, who’s from Gloucestershire, with the crew bringing us food. She was so ill I watched all night, worrying she wasn’t going to make it. ‘The worst thing was they already knew they had had the norovirus, because they delayed our departure from Portsmouth for 24 hours to disinfect it. It’s disgusting. ‘Common sense tells you that you can’t disinfect an entire cruise ship in 24 hours, because viruses could get into the air conditioning, the heating, and the ventilation systems. ‘Because the virus involves sickness and diarrhoea, you can imagine what it was like.’ Contagion: Even the books on the the ship run by Fred Olsen Cruise Lines had to be sanitised . Mrs Bounds said the illness spread within 24 hours. Public lavatories were closed and the casino was off bounds in case cards were infected. She said: ‘We learned from one of the new staff on board that all crew members were on “Code Red”, which he said meant crew were not allowed to touch passengers unless using protective clothing. ‘I think this alone shows the seriousness of the outbreak. ‘My friend Veronica, who’s 70 and a retired accountant and property developer, was very ill and the crew told us that in their opinion she was too ill to be airlifted from the ship. But the ship was loaded with another lot of passengers soon after we got off, and our cabin was being cleaned by a normal maid. I saw no sign of it being deep-cleaned or sterilised.’ Expensive cruises have surged in popularity recently – but are all too often struck by virus outbreaks, which spread rapidly in enclosed spaces. A Fred Olsen spokesman said: ‘The number of guests affected during the cruise was 61, out of a total of 732 guests. ‘The highest number of guests isolated at any one time was 29. Boudicca underwent an extensive “deep clean” and sanitising operation by independent specialist contractors before she embarked. It was extremely disappointing that, following these rigorous measures, the virus was brought back on to the ship.’","Luxury liner on £900 ten-day cruise hit by norovirus infection .

Laylah Willett of Baldwin County, Alabama was on a school field trip to a farm in Greene County, Mississippi when the she fell down the seismograph hole. The young girl was trapped for three terrifying hours until the local fire department was able to free her. Emotional rescue: The dramatic moment when Laylah emerged, covered in mud, after being trapped down a well for three hours . Once the rescue time arrived it took 45 minutes to get young Laylah back to the surface. Until the rescuers arrived a local youth minister kept the little girl calm by talking to her and sending down a . doll and some juice. The rescue wasn’t without its problems. The hole was just large enough for the young girl to fall down but not big enough for an adult to fit down, so instead the rescue team had to use a harness. That meant placing a lot of responsibility on young Laylah’s shoulders . Laylah Willet speaks to the media the day after her ordeal, with her doll Lily for support . 'Just her age and maturity, would she be able to follow the instructions to get into the harness? And once we got her into the harness, it was just trying to keep her calm while we got her out,' Robert Pickering of the Hattiesburg Fire Department told WLOX13. Another obstacle was that the girl was stuck in mud at the bottom of the hole and so once she was in a harness it took several attempts to get her unstuck and moving up the shaft. When she finally emerged she was covered in mud, but not seriously injured. She was taken to the hospital, but her only physical injuries were a neck scratch and slight bruising around her arms. On Friday Laylah spoke to Local 15 News, still holding the doll sent down to her which she had named Lily. In a horse voice she said 'bugs and dirt' was what she remembered from her ordeal. 'She was extraordinary. I couldn't believe how well she handled it. She's the bravest 6-year-old I know,' said her father Robert Willett.

"PUBLISHED: . 13:06 EST, 9 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:48 EST, 9 June 2013 . A Manhattan photographer who snapped pictures of his neighbors as they dwelled inside their own apartments and turned them into high-priced art is fighting back against privacy lawsuit as his blown up prints hit a New York City gallery. Not too far from his own apartment in the Tribeca neighborhood, photographer Arne Svenson’s work is now onsale at the Julie Saul Gallery in Chelsea for up to $7,500. Meanwhile, some subjects of his work are unhappy they’re naps and other everyday acts have been transformed into art without their consent. Svenson, who says his neighbors are ‘performing behind a transparent scrim on a stage of their own creation with the curtain raised high,’ has filed a motion to dismiss legal complaints that he’s broken the law. Uncomfortably close: Arne Svenson secretly took shots of his neighbors doing everyday things like napping in their own homes with a zoom lens. His work now hangs in a New York gallery and some of his subjects are unhappy . The photographer says he 'started the . project after inheriting a telephoto lens from a friend. He began taking . pictures of the large-windowed apartments opposite his own Tribeca home . in 2012. Those images . are now on show, which prompted a legal complaint from Martha and . Matthew Foster, parents of young children featured in two of his . photographs. The Fosters . said the pictures raised concerns about the safety of their children as . well as fears that they ‘must keep their shades drawn at all hours of . the day in order to avoid telephoto photography by a neighbor.’ Aptly named: The exhibit, called 'The Neighbors' hands at New York City's Julie Saul gallery . Doubly awkward: When Svenson's work showed up at Julie Saul Gallery, the parents of two children who appeared in the exhibit complained and those photos have since been removed . Whose right? Svenson took pictures of the dwellers of this Tribeca apartment building. One couple now demands his photos of their household be removed from the artist's possession . For . the rest of New York, the controversy over the exhibition has triggered . a conversation about First Amendment rights and just how much privacy . city dwellers can expect. In . the latest development, Svenson is claiming he’s done nothing wrong. On . Wednesday, his attorney filed a motion calling for the New York county . court to throw out the Fosters' complaint. The motion argues that the . pictures are not illegal and are protected under an artist's freedom of . expression under First Amendment rights. Svenson . is no longer commenting on the controversy, but says in his exhibition . notes: ‘For my subjects, there is no question of privacy… The neighbors . don't know they are being photographed; I carefully shoot from the . shadows of my home into theirs.’ High art: Svenson defends his work in his exhibit notes, 'They're performing behind a transparent scrim on a stage of their own creation with the curtain raised high' The . photographs themselves are both abstract and specific, capturing . mundane but intimate moments of domestic modern life. All are carefully . framed to avoid revealing the full faces of their subjects. A . woman in a raincoat stands by the window, her face obscured by a . twisted gold curtain. A man in T-shirt and jeans dozes on a sofa. An . expectant mother is pictured in profile. The lower halves of a couple in . bath robes are caught breakfasting, their feet touching under the . table. Another woman is crouched near the window, scrubbing the floor or . picking something off the ground. Obscured? 'For my subjects, there is no question of privacy,' Svenson says. 'The neighbors don't know they are being photographed; I carefully shoot from the shadows of my home into theirs.' The . Fosters' complaint details the couple's distress about two photos that . feature their children. One image shows Martha Foster holding her . 2-year-old son, with her 4-year-old daughter standing beside her. The . girl is in a swim suit; the boy is wearing a diaper. The document . alleges that the minors' faces are ‘clearly recognizable,’ which could . endanger their safety by attracting the attention of ‘undesirable and . potentially dangerous people.’ Svenson's . legal motion of June 5 asserts that neither his conduct nor photographs . violate any New York laws. The document adds that as the images ‘were . taken through windows that are fully exposed to the street, they cannot . support a claim for intentional infliction of severe emotional . distress.’ With regard . to the photos that feature the Fosters, the motion states that the faces . of the parents are not revealed, the children are obscured and the . subjects are in plain view. ‘Both photographs capture children at play . and the innocence of childhood, nothing more revealing than you might . see in a neighborhood park,’ the document says. It asserts that . Svenson's images are protected by First Amendment rights and that the . ‘Plaintiffs should not be permitted to use the Court to attempt to . restrict artistic expressions that they disagree with.’ The . plaintiffs say they are ‘frightened and angered’ by the ‘utter . disregard for their privacy and the privacy of their children’ and the . ‘seclusion and solitude of their homes.’ Birds-eye view: Svenson shot the photos with a zoom lens he says he inherited from a friend. Seen here is his position at left and the building he photographed at right . The . complaint adds that Svenson's conduct is ‘so out of keeping with the . standards of morality in the community as to evince an intentional or . reckless disregard of its likelihood to cause severe emotional distress . to the Fosters.’ Although Svenson removed the pictures . from the exhibition when contacted by an attorney, the Fosters still . want to remove all remaining pictures from the photographer's . possession, a permanent injunction against further photographic . intrusions, plus damages and costs. Julie Saul, the gallery owner and . director, told Reuters that the reaction to the exhibition was a ‘huge . surprise’ and a ‘tempest in a teapot.’ Compensation: A woman takes her own picture at Svenson's exhibit.

Mickey Osterreicher, an attorney and . general counsel for the National Press Photographers Association, . described the case as ‘very interesting.’ ‘Most people have this sense in New York because everybody lives so close together, because the line sights are such, that you can very easily look into your neighbors' apartment and they can look into yours, but I think the court may parse this out as looking is one thing and photographing is another,’ he told Reuters.

'It really never occurred to me that there would any of the controversial issues' Osterreicher is concerned that a ruling in this case could ‘create more pushback by people who are looking to create an expectation of privacy even when you're out in public.’ He thinks this could lead to First Amendment protections being ‘chipped away.’ Osterreicher believes that this case has been a negative one for the image of photography and First Amendment rights due to the ‘bad taste’ that has been left with the public. The attorney believes that the case against Svenson may ‘turn more on the facts of the case than on the actual law.’ While the case remains in the hands of the New York State Justice system, the issues raised by Svenson's photographs are as ethical as they are legal. Saul said: ‘If it's an ethical issue I think it's about the individual, and the way that Arne has handled this work is incredibly respectful and ethical.’ Clearly, others disagree.

Caught: Christopher Maffei, 43, surrendered while allegedly attempting to flee with his two children he kidnapped from their mother . A San Francisco Bay Area father has been sentenced to three years in jail for abducting his two young children and taking them away on a stolen yacht. Christopher Maffei, 43, was sentenced Friday in San Mateo County Superior Court, where he was also ordered to do 16 months of supervision and stay away from his kids until his sentence is served. With good behavior, Maffei will only spend about nine more months behind bars because of jail time he has served since his arrest, San Mateo County prosecutors said. Authorities say Maffei took his 2-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter from their South San Francisco home in September and packed them on a 41-foot yacht stolen from an Alameda marina. Officials say Maffei and the children spent three days on the water before the vessel ran out of gas off the Monterey County shore, where he surrendered to authorities. They kids were not hurt. Maffei had pleaded no contest in April to one count of child abduction and one count of possession of a stolen boat. His defense attorney Jeff Boyarsky said Maffei 'realizes it was inappropriate, illegal and not supported by any kind of rational thinking.' 'He wants the rest of the family and the public to know he's sorry for the anguish he caused,' Boyarsky told the San Mateo County Times. Maffei believed his kids were in danger in part because they were around an aunt with alleged substance abuse problems, but authorities never found any evidence of abuse, Boyarsky said. Found: Brooklyn, aged three, left, were taken from her mother's home along with her baby brother Devin, aged two, right . Escape: Maffei was found on this stolen sailboat, a white Hunter 41, he had previously shown interest in buying . Maffei is the former boyfriend of the children's mother, Jennifer Hipon. She told reporters that she was at a courthouse filing custody documents when Maffei went to her house and took the children from her elderly mother. South San Francisco police say that after running off with the children, Maffei drove to the harbor in Alameda and left on the 40-foot sailboat. He sailed the boat out under the Golden Gate Bridge and headed down the coast, police said. Destination? The children's mother believed Maffei may have been trying to sail towards Mexico where he talked about taking his two children on holiday . San Francisco police said Maffei had . visited the owner of the stolen yacht with his two children weeks . earlier ago to ask about buying it.
