Hotel guests may get a shock next time they reach for a copy of the Gideon Bible from their bedside cabinet. The Damson Dene hotel near Windermere, Cumbria, has decided to replace the book - which is traditionally stocked by British hotels - with copies of the erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey. The decision has caused outrage - although many female guests, and some men, are sure to be pleasantly surprised when they discover the best-selling novel in their rooms. Hotel manager Wayne Bartholomew has caused outrage by replacing the Gideon Bible with copies of the erotic novel, 'Fifty Shades of Grey' in guests' bedside cabinets. Located in the tranquil Lyth Valley, the upmarket hotel boasts 40 bedrooms, including ten with four poster beds and an en-suite Jacuzzi bath. Guests can enjoy its landscaped gardens, and make use of its pool, spa pool, sauna, steam room and gym. Prices range from £79 per person for a standard room to £99 per person for the rooms with four poster beds. Hotel manager, Wayne Bartholomew . said he hit on the idea to swap the books in response to online chatter from his more than . 3,200 Facebook contacts. He said: 'Fifty Shades of Grey is all . that people are talking about at the moment, but I know that some are . too shy to buy it for themselves. 'I thought it would be a special treat for our guests to find it in their bedside cabinet and that includes the men.

'They are as desperate to get their hands on a copy as are the women.' Mr Bartholomew said the Gideon Bible was also full of 'sex and violence,' but said it was more formally written than EL James' steamy novel. 'James’ book is easier to read,' he said. EL James has sold millions of copies of her erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey worldwide. The three books of the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy are the first, second and third best-selling print books at .

A severely autistic 14-year-old boy, Alex Spourdalakis, was found stabbed to death in the apartment he shared with his mother, Dorothy Spourdalakis, in the suburban Chicago town of River Grove Sunday afternoon. Both his mother and his caregiver were also found in the room, semi-conscious. The boy's father, who doesn't live at the apartment, had been calling the family and was unable to get through so he went over with the boy's uncle to see if anything was wrong. 'They couldn't reach the family by phone, so they went over and gained entry to the apartment,' River Grove Police Chief Rodger Loni told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. They called police around 3 p.m. when they discovered the body, and found the two women somewhat conscious. Stabbed: 14-year-old Alex Spourdalakis was found dead in his bed Sunday afternoon, with several stab wounds to his chest. Above, a recent picture of Alex restrained at a hospital where he was being treated for gastrointestinal problems . According to Loni, they found the boy with several stab wounds to the chest that looked 'domestic in nature.' The boy's mother and caretaker, both 50, were also found in the room incoherent and somewhat unconscious.One was on the bed and the other was on the floor. The boy was pronounced dead at the scene while the two women were taken to Gottlieb Hospital in Melrose Park to recover. Neither had any visual injuries. Loni said they may have taken drugs before police arrived. Police found a hand-written note at the scene that explains what happened, with both women's names - but have not released further details about the piece of evidence. No answer: When no one answered the phone, the boy's father and uncle went over to the apartment and discovered Alex dead . River Grove Police and the Western Suburban Major Crimes Task Force are currently investigating the case as a 'death investigation.' Loni says that they suspect foul play but are waiting on a medical examiner's autopsy, scheduled for Monday afternoon, to determine whether the boy's death was homicide. Police did not find the weapon in the apartment, and there was no sign of a break-in. The boy's father is cooperating in the investigation and the mother has already issued a statement. The caregiver, however, is not cooperating. Police believe that the two women may hold the answers to what happened Sunday. 'They know something that happened there, but whether they're responsible or not, I can't say at this point in time,' Loni told CBS Chicago. This wasn't the first time that River Grove police had been called to the Spourdalakis home. The 6-foot, 225 pound boy often became hard to manage when the women needed to take him to doctor's appointments, so they would have to call the police to restrain him. According to police, they had been called to the apartment seven times since November 2012. Loni described the boy as 'a big, strong, young man.' Alex was in the news last March when FOX 32 profiled the boy. His mother believed he was being mistreated at a local hospital where where he was staying for gastrointestinal issues. The staff kept him in restraints the whole time. She said her son was severely autistic and non-verbal and that doctors labelled him as cognitively impaired. Interviewed: The boy's mother, Dorothy Spourdalakis, was interviewed this past March when he was being kept in restraints at a local hospital. Dorothy has already issued a statement to the police but the caregiver is not cooperating .","Alex Spourdalakis, 14, was found dead in his suburban Chicago home with several stab wounds in the chest .

Nudists are to be banned from one of Britain's most famous beaches that featured in Shakespeare In Love amid fears it is being invaded by sex swingers and 'perverts'. Naturists are being told to cover up on the nationally-renowned sands at Holkham, near Wells, north Norfolk, after complaints about lewd and anti-social behaviour. The beach, which is part of Holkham Estate, was the setting for the final scene of the Oscar winning film when Gwyneth Paltrow survives a shipwreck. Scroll down for video . Nudists will be banned from Holkham Beach in Norfolk after concerns about 'swingers and perverts' Holkham Estate has moved to close the special nudist zone on the western section of the sweeping beach from July 1 after they discussed the growing outdoor sex crisis with police. It has acted as concern mounts locally over incidents of public indecency on the stunning stretch of the east coast, which attracts about 500,000 people every year. The ban comes after a Facebook campaign was launched in the summer of 2010 to crack down on sex pests roaming the sands. Locals have complained about people having sex in public and propositioning beach-goers. One campaigner wrote in August 2010: 'My last three visits to the beach have seen me propositioned twice. 'I've witnessed gay sex in the sand dunes and men walking around ""playing"". 'I've reported this to the wardens and local PCSO but nothing has been done. 'The beach used to be a lovely place to go but now it's just a haven for swingers and perverts who won't take no for an answer.' Norfolk Police said at the time that . officers were investigating reports that beach-goers had been acting in . an 'inappropriate manner'. The stunning beach was used for the final scene of Shakespeare In Love (pictured) Conservation manager Sarah Henderson said 'persistent anti-social behaviour' forced them into the ban . The . western section of Holkham beach has been a designated destination for . naturists for a number of years and is flagged up on swinging and . dogging websites. Sarah Henderson, conservation manager at the Holkham Estate, said last night: 'It is sad that we have been forced to take this step due to the persistent anti-social behaviour of a minority of people. 'The management and control of these activities has been an increasing concern to me and my team who look after the reserve so we have had to take action to ban all nudism. 'We have consulted with the police and discussed the issues and options. 'The decision has been made to implement a total ban for the better management and future safety of all our visitors.' Signs will be erected to highlight the new order and Holkham Estate wardens will be patrolling the beach to ensure visitors comply with the new policy. They have been instructed to tell any . naturists to put their clothes on and if they refuse they face being . arrested and prosecuted. A Facebook group was set up three years ago trying to ban naturists from Holkham Beach . Holkham National Nature Reserve, which includes the beach, is managed by Holkham Estate. The dunes are owned and managed by the estate. The beautiful beach is owned by the Crown Estate and managed by Natural England. Both organisations were consulted over the decision but naturist groups have reacted angrily to the news. Andrew . Welch, a spokesman for British Naturism, said: 'Many of our members . enjoy coming to this beautiful part of the country to sunbathe on the . beach and socialise with like-minded people without causing any . problems. 'Unfortunately some people see being nude as an excuse to misbehave and it is a great shame that a small minority of trouble-makers ruin it for all of us. 'These people should be dealt with by the police. If 20 people out of 20,000 in a football stadium cause trouble they don't close the whole stadium. 'So it is a shame that the Holkham Estate has come to make this decision and we would like to open some dialogue with them about this.' A boat on Holkham beach . Holkham beach, which is part of Holkham National Nature Reserve, attracts about 500,000 visitors a year. It was the setting of the final scene in the Oscar-winning film Shakespeare In Love. The film ends with Gwyneth Paltrow walking along the sand. Natural England has described it as one of the most important and heavily  visited sites in the UK. The beach is backed by a pine forest and is renowned for being one of the best stretches of unspoiled coastline in the UK. It regularly makes the list of the most recommended naturist beaches. The stretch of sand has also played host to a Royal holiday. In 1957, the Queen, Prince Philip and a young Princess Anne and Prince Charles spent time on the beach. The conservation area is also a favourite among twitchers as a variety of birds graze along the salt marshes. The beach, which features about three miles of unspoiled sand, is largely man-made. It was reclaimed from the sea in the 19th Century by the 2nd Earl of Leicester, who planted pine trees to stabilise the sand.","Campaign against the nudist section of Holkham Beach launched in 2010 .

"By . Chris Greenwood . PUBLISHED: . 16:50 EST, 23 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:12 EST, 25 June 2013 . An undercover policeman revealed last night that he took part in an operation to smear the family of Stephen Lawrence. Peter Francis said his superiors wanted him to find ‘dirt’ that could be used against members of the murdered teenager’s family. The spy said he was also tasked with discrediting Stephen’s friend who witnessed the stabbing and campaigners angry at the failure to bring his killers to justice. Scroll down for videos . Spy: Peter Francis said he was asked by senior officers in the Met Police to find information to smear the family of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence . Worried: The Prime Minister said today that Scotland Yard must investigate the damaging claims . He added that senior officers deliberately withheld his role from Sir William Macpherson, who led a public inquiry into the bungled police investigation. Francis said senior officers were afraid that anger at the failure to investigate the teenager’s racist killing would spiral into disorder on the streets. They had ‘visions of Rodney King’, whose beating at the hands of police led to the 1992 LA riots, he said. David Cameron has this morning urged Scotland Yard to launch a probe into what happened. 'The Prime Minister is deeply concerned by reports that the police wanted to smear Stephen Lawrence's family and would like the Metropolitan police to investigate immediately,' A No10 spokesperson said. The revelations mark the most extraordinary chapter so far in the sorry history of Scotland Yard’s jaw-dropping undercover operations. Stephen Lawrence was the victim of a racist murder in 1993. It was one of the highest profile racial killings in UK history . The whistleblower is one of several to come forward to reveal deeply suspect practices by those ordered to infiltrate political protest groups from the 1980s onwards. Yesterday Stephen’s mother Doreen said being targeted by an undercover officer was the most surprising thing she had learned about the marathon inquiry. She said: ‘Out of all the things I’ve found out over the years, this certainly has topped it. ‘Nothing can justify the whole thing about trying to discredit the family and people around us.’ The news will further inflame critics of covert policing of activist groups and raises questions over whether a police review will flush out all malpractice.’ The 20-year-old operation was revealed in a joint investigation by The Guardian and Channel 4’s Dispatches being broadcast tonight. Francis posed as an anti-racist activist during four years he spent living undercover among protest groups following Stephen’s murder in April 1993. The former officer said he came under ‘huge and constant pressure’ to ‘hunt for disinformation’ that might be used to undermine those arguing for a better investigation into the murder. He now wants a full public inquiry into the undercover policing of protest groups, which he labelled ‘morally reprehensible’ in the past. He said: ‘I had to get any information on what was happening in the Stephen Lawrence campaign. ‘They wanted the campaign to stop. It . was felt it was going to turn into an elephant. Throughout my . deployment there was almost constant pressure on me personally to find . out anything I could that would discredit these campaigns.’ Mr Francis joins a number of whistle blowers who infiltrated protest groups for the Met Police . Francis was also involved in an ultimately failed effort to discredit Duwayne Brooks, a close friend of Lawrence who was with him on the night he was murdered. The former spy trawled through hours of CCTV from a demonstration to find evidence that led to Mr Brooks being arrested and charged with violent disorder in October 1993. However, the case was thrown out by a judge as an abuse of the legal process. Family: Stephen Lawrence's mother Doreen and ex-husband Neville, Stephen's father . The spy monitored a number of ‘black justice’ campaigns, involving relatives of mostly black men who had died in suspicious circumstances in police custody. But he said his handlers were most interested in any information he could gather about the several groups campaigning over the death of Stephen. Although Francis did not meet the Lawrence family, he passed back ‘hearsay’ about them to his superiors. Mrs Lawrence said she was always baffled why family liaison officers were recording the identities of everyone entering and leaving their household following her son’s murder. She said the family had always suspected police had been gathering evidence about her visitors to discredit them but had no ‘concrete evidence’. In 1997, Francis argued that the Met should ‘come clean’ over the existence of its undercover operation to Sir William and his inquiry. But commanders opted for secrecy and claimed it was for the public good as there would be ‘battling on the streets’ if the public ever found out. Francis was a member of a covert unit known as the Special Demonstration Squad. Set up to combat protests against the Vietnam war in 1968, the SDS was funded by the Home Office to operate under the radar for four decades. Using the undercover alias Pete Black, he worked between 1993 and 1997 infiltrating a group named Youth Against Racism in Europe. He said he was one of four undercover officers who were also required to feed back intelligence about the campaigns for justice over the death of Stephen. The now disbanded unit has already been struck by controversy after its spies fathered children with their targets. An external investigation of past undercover deployments is being undertaken by a team of officers led by Derbyshire chief constable Mick Creedon. Pete Francis monitored a number of 'black justice' campaigns, involving relatives of mostly black men who had died in suspicious circumstances in police custody . Mr Brooks always suspected he was a victim of a dirty tricks campaign by police. In an interview six years after the murder he said he felt the police ‘investigated us more thoroughly than they investigated the boys’ – referring to those behind the killing. Jack Straw, the former home secretary who in 1997 ordered the inquiry that led to the Macpherson report, said he was stunned. He said: ‘I should have been told of anything that was current, post the election of Tony Blair’s government in early May 1997. But much more importantly, [the] Macpherson inquiry should have been told.’ Lord Condon, Met Commissioner between 1993 and 2000, said he was not aware any information had been withheld from Sir William. A Met spokesman said: ‘The claims in relation to Stephen Lawrence’s family will bring particular upset to them and we share their concerns.’ These revelations and others about undercover police officers are contained in the book Undercover by Paul Lewis and Rob Evans.

A grieving family has received an apology from a lettings agency who invited potential tenants to view the home of a much-loved father and grandfather while his body was still inside. George Murton, 88, died peacefully at the bungalow he cherished in Rainham, Kent, on April 19. Within two hours of his death, his daughter Linda Preston, 65, notified Orbit Housing, who then posted details of the bungalow being available for rent on its website. In shock: The family of George Murton, 88, were barely coming to terms with his death when prospective tenants arrived to look at his rented house in Kent (pictured) Would-be tenants were allowed to visit the exterior of the property and even looked through the windows and the letter box as Mr Murton’s body was in his bedroom and the family was holding a wake. Intrusion: Visitors began looking through the letterbox and windows while Mr Murton's body was still inside . In preparation for his funeral the family had decided not to move the grandfather from the home he had shared with his late wife Ann for 18 years. Mr Murton’s close-knit family today said the 'intrusion into their privacy' had left them heartbroken. Granddaughter Clare Marlow, 38, said: 'We all had a lot on our minds at the time and my mum was just being courteous. 'We had no idea it would be put on the bidding market within two hours. 'If we had known there would be people turning up we would have paid the extra rent for a couple of weeks. 'It is absolutely disgusting that people were knocking on the door when my granddad was being laid to rest in his bedroom.' Stephen Hanley, lettings manager for Orbit South today issued an apology to the family. He said: 'When a property becomes available, our usual procedure is to advertise it as soon as possible to allow us to promptly re-let homes to customers with a housing need. 'Our adverts do not give details of specific addresses, however once a property is advertised it is not uncommon for potential applicants to visit the location and try to establish which property will shortly be coming available.

'On this occasion, we advertised the property, but unfortunately on the same day we were contacted to notify us that the family was holding a wake.

At least 27 people have been killed after gangs armed with knives attacked a police station and a local government building in a remote region of western China today, according to state media. The Xinhua agency said mobs in the Xinjiang region - home to a large Muslim Uighur minority - set upon buildings in the township of Lukqun at around 6am local time, stabbing people and setting fire to police cars. Nine police officers and security guards and eight civilians were killed before police opened fire on the attackers, leaving 10 dead, regional Communist Party officials told the agency. Restive: Violence erupted in the remote western Xinjiang region, where there were protests in 2009 (pictured) after riots pitting Muslim Uighurs against ethnic Chinese left nearly 200 dead (file photo) The reported unrest in the region was the deadliest since July 2009, when nearly 200 people were killed in riots pitting Uighurs against ethnic Chinese in the region's capital Urumqi. The reasons for today's attacks were not immediately clear. Many Uighurs, who speak a Turkic language, chafe at what they call Chinese government restrictions on their culture, language and religion. China says it grants Uighurs wide-ranging freedoms and accuses extremists of separatism. Xinjiang is ruled by China's Han ethnic majority. It has been the scene of numerous violent incidents in recent years. The report said three rioters were seized, and that police pursued fleeing suspects, though it did not say how many. A further three people were injured in the unrest today, Xinhua said. The state media report has not been independently confirmed. Information is tightly controlled in the region, which the Chinese government regards as highly sensitive and where it has imposed a heavy security presence to quell unrest. However, forces are spread thin across the vast territory and the response from authorities is often slow. An official reached by phone at the press office of the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau, the region's police, told the Associated Press she had only seen news of the violence on the Internet and had no information. Other officials at the county's propaganda department and police said they also had no details. Calls to the region's government spokeswoman, Hou Hanmin, rang unanswered. Reported deaths: The Xinjiang region borders Central Asia, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and has been the scene of numerous violent incidents in recent years . Violence: The reported scenes in Xinjiang today were the deadliest since the 2009 riots, which saw Uighurs taking to the streets in the capital Urumqi to voice their anger (seen in a file photo) An overseas Uighur activist said the conflict was triggered by the Chinese government's 'sustained repression and provocation' of the Uighur community. Dilxat Raxit, spokesman for the Germany-based World Uyghur Congress, urged the international community to pressure China to 'stop imposing policies in Xinjiang that cause turmoil'. China often accuses overseas Uighur activists of orchestrating violent incidents and obscure militant groups sometimes take responsibility, with little or no evidence to prove claims on either side.","Mobs stabbed people and and set fire to police cars, state news agency said .

An outspoken Chinese-American investor and social media celebrity has been arrested on suspicion of visiting a prostitute following a crackdown on bloggers who have posted sensitive material on China's heavily restricted Internet. Charles Xue, who has more than 12 million . followers on the Twitter-like Sina Weibo, was detained on Friday . evening in a Beijing neighborhood along with a 22-year-old woman, according to . police and state media on Sunday. The naturalized American citizen, 60, . regularly reposts reform-minded content and frequently comments on other . issues including China's air quality and food safety. Questioned: Chinese-American investor and social media celebrity Charles Xue has been arrested on suspicion of visiting a prostitute . Last week government-run newspaper The People's Daily reminded China's 'big Vs' - popular bloggers whose social media profiles are verified as genuine - that they 'should be careful what information they convey ... and use their right to expression responsibly.' Many Chinese celebrities, from pop stars to business tycoons, have amassed huge followings on social media sites, and at times have posted material that the government has not approved of, such as calling attention to social injustices and questioning state policies. This month, internet censors called popular microbloggers to meetings and asked them to agree to standards, including keeping social order - a move observers have said has a chilling effect on public discourse. State media have also accused some microbloggers of undermining socialism and promoting Western values through lies and negative news. Xue's celebrity name, Xue Manzi, shot to the top of the most-searched for terms after the venture capitalist's arrest was announced. Popular: Chales Xue has more than 12million followers on the Twitter-like site Sina Weibo and regularly posts reform-minded content . Among those questioning the motive behind the arrest was the editor of the state-run Global Times newspaper. 'Cannot rule out the possibility that authorities are arresting Xue Manzi with a prostitute to give him a hard time,' Hu Xijin wrote Sunday in a blog posting that later disappeared. Referring to Xue, Beijing police announced on their own microblog on Sunday that a 60-year-old man with the surname Xue had been detained Friday and confessed to visiting a prostitute. It said he had been arrested in a Beijing neighborhood along with a 22-year-old woman who had admitted to prostitution. Xue's arrest follows a similar string of detentions in recent days of others who have triggered scandals online. On Friday, police questioned Liu Hu, an investigative reporter of the Guangzhou-based New Express, who had alleged on his microblog that a senior government official was negligent with his public duties. Detained: Chinese police said that a 60-year-old man with the surname Xue had been arrested along with a 22-year-old woman, and had confessed to visiting a prostitute . Liu was arrested on suspicion of fabricating and spreading rumors and the case is being investigated, according to the Beijing police's microblog. Among others questioned was blogger Zhou Lubao, who many have dubbed 'watch brother' after he initiated a campaign against an official who wore expensive watches that he wouldn't have been able to afford on his salary. The Chinese Ministry of Public Security said that Zhou had been arrested on suspicion of extortion. Blogger and former journalist Zhu Ruifeng said that the arrests were a response to the huge influence some commentators were gaining online, and the fact that more and more people were denouncing officials via social media. Mr Zhu himself triggered a scandal last year when he released an online video of one official having sex with a woman hired by property developers in an alleged extortion scheme. Mr Zhu said that Xue's name was all over state media and that the government had intended to damage his reputation,as well as showing that the authorities were serious about controlling online opinion-formers.","Venture capitalist Charles Xue, 60, arrested with 22-year-old woman .

But summer cooler drinks have been branded 'toxic sugar bombs' after it was discovered that they contain up to 20 teaspoons of sugar- that's the equivalent of 31 digestive biscuits. An investigation by The Sunday Mirror found that summer cooler drinks from coffee giants such as Costa and Starbucks contain a worrying amount of sugar. Sugar bomb: An investigation has shown that iced coffees from high street coffee giants contain an alarmingly high amount of sugar . They found that a medium Toffee Creamy ­Cooler contains a shocking 81.6 grams of sugar - the same content as in 31 digestive biscuits. Not only is the sugar content an issue, the drink also contains the recommended daily amount of saturated fat for a woman in just a few sips. Starbucks are also guilty of packing the sugar into their summer drinks. One culprit is the large ­Strawberries and Cream ­Frappuccino, which contains a staggering 76.2 grams of sugar – that's more than 18 teaspoons' worth. Health warning: Costa and Starbucks are amongst the worst culprits with a Costa Toffee Creamy Cooler (L) containing a shocking 81.6 grams of sugar - the same content as in 31 digestive biscuits . It may appear healthy because it contains fruit in the title but the frappuccino also contains  a massive  459 calories because of its cream and full-fat milk content. That's almost as many calories as a McDonald's Big Mac. Not so sweet: Costa's Toffee Creamy Cooler contains the recommended daily amount of saturated fat for a woman in just a few sips . The Starbucks peppermint mocha frappuccino in venti with whole milk and whipped cream is 540 calories. A spokesman for Starbucks said: 'We . promote choice at Starbucks and were one of the first high street food . and drink retailers to display calorie content on our menu boards, as . part of our commitment to the Department of Health’s Responsibility . Deal. 'All product nutritional information is also easily available on our website to help inform customers’ choices. 'The Strawberries and Cream . Frappuccino is one of a range of summer drinks we offer at Starbucks, . from indulgent treats like a Frappuccino to a Refresha. For example, a grande (medium) Cool . Lime Refresha contains 17g of sugar and less than 100 calories. Customers can also customise their drinks  to reduce calorie and sugar . content - we have a Strawberries and Cream Frappuccino Light, which . reduces calories by approximately a third. Customers can also choose to have a smaller size, skimmed milk, sugar free syrups, and forgo whipped cream.' Costa's strawberry cooler is an even worse offender - a large size with cream and full fat milk is 653 calories -  that's the same as having a McDonald's burger and fries. Meanwhile, Caffe Nero's . whole milk caramel frappe latte is 455 calories, the equivalent to two . large glasses of white wine and some pretzels. Now that brands are under more pressure . to display nutritional information on their products, consumers are . becoming more savvy to the hidden calories in shop bought coffees. With this in mind, anti-obesity ­campaigners have called for the Government to impose limits on calories and sugars. Dr Ian Campbell, head of the National Obesity Forum, told The Sunday Mirror that the stance taken by the likes of Costa and ­Starbucks is only contributing to the obesity crisis. He told them: 'The nutritional information for these drinks is quite staggering. 'The ­combination of one of these beverages with, say, a brownie is actually quite toxic. 'You’re looking at a sugar bomb. It’s because of products like this that people are facing an obesity crisis. There can be no responsible justification for it.' A spokesman for Costa told MailOnline: Costa takes the nutritional balance of all its food and drink very seriously. 'We have increased the quality of information available in store and online via our Costa nutritional tool and have carried out a lot of work, particularly in the Iced drink range to reduce calorie content with the intention to continuing to find ways to reduce fat, calories and sugar levels throughout our product offerings. 'Last year we introduced our iced-lemonades to the range, with the primo size containing less than 100 calories. Our Skinny Iced Cappuccino has fewer than 50Kcals. 'Costa seeks to provide customers with a choice of products across its drink and food ranges, meeting all key health trends; allowing them to choose lower-calorie options if they so wish as well as a more indulgent occasional treat'. The 18 teaspoons of sugar found in the Starbucks iced drink is equivalent to eating:    An entire box of six Mr Kipling Cherry Bakewell tarts . 11 packs of Marks and Spencer's Percy Pig sweets . 19 30g servings of Kellogg's Rice Crispies . 2 Mars bars .","Costa Toffee Creamy ­Cooler contains same sugar content as 31 digestive biscuits .

"By . Andrew Malone . UPDATED: . 11:07 EST, 24 October 2011 . As family days out, it must rank as one of the more bizarre and macabre. Men, women and children lined-up in the hot sunshine yesterday for a chance to view the corpse of Muammar Gaddafi, the dead Libyan dictator and self-styled King of Kings. In a refrigerated store room at a shopping centre - normally used to store chickens before being stacked on the shelves - the chance to glimpse the decaying corpse of Gaddafi was the sole attraction in Misrata, once Libya's richest city and now reduced to rubble after the war. Gruesome: Andrew Malone crouched over the body of the former self-styled King of Kings . Observers look on as Andrew Malone views the body lying in a makeshift mortuary in Misrata . After he was captured alive on Thursday, hiding in a drainpipe and begging for his life, the cadaver of Gaddafi - along with Mutassim, his son, and ex-defense minister Abu Bakr Younis  - was taken by truck and deposited in the meat chilling room at the shopping centre on the outskirts of the city. Now the country's new rulers are facing their first conundrums: what do with Gaddafi's body, now discoloured and fast decaying after four days in the chicken chill room, as well as how to deal with mounting evidence that the dictator was taunted and tortured before being shot in cold blood . With residents of Libya's major cities refusing to have the dictator buried in their midst, and calls by Gaddafi's wife for the body to be sent to be with her in exile in Algeria, the country's military chiefs are even discussing secretly disposing of the body in the Mediterranean. 'We don't want a shrine to him,' one commander told me yesterday. 'He doesn't deserve a proper burial. We need to get rid of the body the way the Americans dealt with Osama Bin Laden (who was dumped at sea in secret location.' But any decision on what to do with the body was delayed again yesterday as a post-mortem was carried out before the first families were allowed into the shopping centre, which is now surrounded by soldiers. And it came as calls mounted for a probe into the circumstances of Gaddafi's last hours, which overshadowed  by Libya's new rulers Sunday to declare liberation and a formal end to the eight-month civil war. Hundreds of ordinary Libyans, including women and children, queue to see the corpse of former dictator Muammar Gaddafi . Waiting in line: Libyans wait patiently to see Gaddafi's body . Cameras ready: Two women give peace signs before entering the makeshift mortuary . Stench: Libyan people cover their faces as they visit the body of their slain former leader inside a storage freezer in Misrata . Decomposing: People were keen to see Gaddafi's body, which has been lying in the room for four days, and know for themselves that the fallen strongman was dead . As the post-mortem confirmed that Gaddafi died from a gunshot to the head, Libyan officials continued to back official claims that wounded Gaddafi was killed in cross-fire following his capture. With Britain and American both calling for a full-investigation, western leaders claimed that the revolution has been a 'little bit stained' by the circumstances of his death. Philip Hammond, the British defence secretary, said: 'It's certainly not the way we do things. We would have liked to see Colonel Gaddafi going on trial to answer for his misdeeds.' A human rights groups says it has discovered 53 decomposing bodies, apparently of Moammar Gaddafi loyalists, some of whom may have been executed by revolutionary forces. The New York-based Human Rights Watch said today that the discovery in Gaddafi's hometown of Sirte 'seems part of a trend of killings, looting and other abuses committed by anti-Gaddafi fighters who consider themselves above the law.' The group urged Libyan authorities to rein in armed groups. The latest discovery of the grave came to light as Libya's new leaders declared the country liberated, following a brutal eight-month civil war. The declaration was overshadowed by continued questions about whether Gaddafi was executed after capture last week. The U.S. and Britain have called for an investigation. But Mahmoud Jibril, the acting Libyan prime minister, insisted there is 'no reason' to doubt the credibility of an official report that the ousted leader died in cross-fire. 'Have you seen a video of somebody killing him? I haven't seen any video tape or mobile film that shows somebody is killing Gaddafi,' Jibril told reporters. Despite these claims, new evidence emerged yesterday that Gaddafi was driven to several different locations in the back of a lorry, where he was beaten and taunted by excited crowds. Incredibly, officials now believe that he fled to Sirte, his birthplace, within days of the capital Tripoli falling in August. Investigators believe he was holed up with around 500 loyal body-guards, whose bodies still lay strewn about the city after the dictator was captured there on Thursday. Besieged inside the city of 150,000 as rebels backed by NATO airstrikes assumed control of the rest of the country, Gaddafi first tried to escape by sea as the fighters closed in last week. But after his convoy came under attack, Gaddafi and his men drove back into their stronghold – only to be hit by NATO airstrikes. While Muttasim fled in one direction, Gaddafi was captured alive in a drainage pipe. According to those present, groups of soldiers started beating him with their shoes and clubs, while others tried to tie him to the bonnet of a vehicle to be driven through the streets. As chaos ensued, a group of rebels bundled Gaddafi into the back of a pick-up and drove away. He was taken to several locations on the way and beaten. Grisly sight: Shell-shocked Libyans look at the bloodied body of their former leader Muammar Gaddafi and take photos . Children were among the crowds waiting to see the former dictator's remains . Playful: Children play in the street as the queue stretches back . Some rebels spat on Gaddafi – and one . man even broke his foot kicking him as others pulled at his hair, . determined to take away a piece of the man who had ruled with an iron . fist for 42 years. According to investigators from Human Rights Watch, Gaddafi did not have any bullet wounds to the head when he was captured and first driven a way, suggesting he was shot later after being beaten. After being allowed to view the bodies, as well as take statements from those present, officials from the New York-based rights group privately acknowledge there is little doubt that Gaddafi was executed. Libya's transitional leader has ordered an investigation into the death of Moammar Gaddafi after the U.S. and other international powers pressed for the probe. Mustafa Abdul-Jalil told a news conference in the eastern city of Benghazi that the National Transitional Council formed a committee to investigate the killing on Thursday, amid conflicting reports of how the dictator who ruled Libya for four decades died. Britain's defence secretary, Philip Hammond, said the Libyan revolutionaries' image had been 'a little bit stained' by Gaddafi's violent death. Both he and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said a full investigation is necessary. Gaddafi's capture and the fall of his hometown of Sirte, the last loyalist stronghold, set the stage for the long-awaited declaration of liberation, delivered by the head of the National Transitional Council, Mustafa Abdul-Jalil. He did not mention the circumstances surrounding Gaddafi's death - mobile phone videos showed the wounded leader being taunted and beaten by a mob after his capture. But he urged his people to avoid hatred. 'The fighters we met were unapologetic - it was one mad man attempting to keep to power,' one investigator told me. 'They don't feel the need to apologise. He killed them – so they killed him. Indeed, the manner of  Gaddafi's death -  now also the centre of calls for a United Nations war crime probe -  was  not of the remotest concern to those who queued patiently for hours in the hope of seeing the corpse yesterday. As I joined the queue, groups of women who had lost husbands and sons in the war were the first to be let into the storage room - the size of the average living room and empty except for bundles inside blankets laid out in a line. Amid the overpowering stench of death, I came first to the body of Muttassim, the dictator's son, who had led the onslaught against the civilian fighters who rose up to challenge his father's rule. With gruesome rumours that Muttassim's genitals had been grossly mutiliated before he, too, was shot dead by his captors, soldiers guarding the bodies refused let anyone pull back the blankets covering the body, with only the head showing. Muattasim's father was alongside him in the centre of the room – again, covered in rough blankets, which had been used to carry the body around while they searched for a suitable storage facility. With his vital organs removed to try to prevent further decay, the dictator's face is now badly discoloured and still bearing spatters of blood from a single gunshot wound to the side of the head. Alongside him, in a similar state, lay Younis. 'We brought our children to see him today because this is a chance to see history,' a man called Mohammed said, holding the hands of his two sons. 'We want to see this arrogant person as a lifeless body. Let all the people see him.' With fears that factional fighting may break out because of a power vacuum, the people here yesterday were refusing to countenance the idea of more bloodshed, preferring to wait patiently in the sun to see the King of Kings lying dead in a chicken fridge.

"By . Nick Pisa . UPDATED: . 07:18 EST, 3 October 2011 . Churchgoers were left stunned after a man tore out both his eyeballs in the middle of a priest's sermon at Sunday Mass in a scene that resembled a horror film. Parishioners in Viareggio, near Pisa, in northern Italy, could only watch as one of their number calmly stood up and carried out the horrific self-mutilation in front of them. Aldo Bianchini, 46, who was born in Britain but has lived in Italy most of his life, is believed to have suffered from voices. A 46-year-old gouged out his own eyes during Sunday Mass at the Sant'Andrea church in Viareggio . He collapsed to the floor in a pool of . blood as his mother frantically tried to help him while the local priest . father Lorenzo Tanganelli rushed out to alert emergency services. The drama happened at the Sant'Andrea church and last night surgeons at the local hospital said that after several hours surgery they had been unable to save his sight and he would remain blind. Doctors said that before the surgery Bianchini had told them he had 'heard voices' telling him to tear out his eyes and Dr Gino Barbacci said: 'In all my 26 years of service I have never seen anything like this before. 'He was in a great deal of agony and he was covered in blood. He said that he had used his bare hands to gouge out his eye balls after hearing voices telling him to do so - to do something like that requires super human strength. 'We tried to operate and save his sight by reinserting the eye balls in both sockets but there was nothing we could do and he will now remain blind.' Last night Father Tanganelli said: 'I had just started to read the sermon when all of a sudden there was a great commotion. 'This man at the back of the knave started tearing at his face and I realised he was gouging out his eyes. 'I called for assistance and the paramedics were quickly at the scene and he was taken away and then I carried on celebrating Mass but a lot of people had left because they were so shocked by what they had seen. 'There must have been 300 people at Mass to begin with and we were lucky that at first one of the closest people to him was an off duty paramedic who was the first to help him but I have never seen as much blood as I saw today.' In the Bible a passage from the Gospel of St Matthew, Jesus tells his disciples: 'If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away.

A new drug created from Botox by a Sheffield University researcher could provide months of pain relief (file photo) Botox, best known for smoothing out wrinkles, could also help soothe the pain of cancer, arthritis and migraines – without any side effects. Sufferers of chronic back pain and women who have given birth by Caesarean section could also benefit from the ‘super-Botox’ jab. A single injection could provide pain relief for months – removing the need for patients to take several daily doses of powerful tablets – and it could be injected into any part of the body. Charities said the drug, invented by a researcher at Sheffield University, could revolutionise the treatment of pain. The main ingredient of the Botox used to prevent wrinkles is a bacterial poison known as botulinum. It works by preventing nerve cells from talking to muscles, which in turn stops muscles moving and wrinkles developing. It can also stop pain signals from being transmitted for months at a time. However, fears that it will paralyse the area being treated have prevented it from being widely used for pain relief. To get round this, Sheffield University researcher Professor Bazbek Davletov took the pain-relieving part of Botox and ‘stapled’ it to a friendly part of a similar poison produced by the tetanus bug. The tetanus toxin ferries the pain-reliever to the spinal cord, where it stops pain signals being sent to the brain. The professor said: ‘In effect, we engineer pain relief by taking only good parts of toxic molecules.’ Animal trials have had encouraging results and, if large-scale trials on people are successful, the drug could be on the market in as little as three years. Professor Davletov designed the drug while working at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. Painkiller: The new 'super-Botox' drug could help treat sufferers of chronic pain (file photo) He said: ‘Currently painkillers relieve lingering pain only temporarily and often have unwanted side-effects. An injection of this new molecule at the site of pain could potentially relieve pain for many months.’ And he added that a public which is willing to have injections for cosmetic purposes would not be squeamish about receiving medicine in the same way. Migraine sufferers are likely to be the first to benefit. Normal Botox can already be used as a treatment for crippling headaches, but fears that it will paralyse the face mean that many sufferers miss out. 'An injection of this new molecule at the site of pain could potentially relieve pain for many months'- Professor Bazbek Davletov, Sheffield University . Cancer patients would also be high on the list as the side-effects of powerful painkillers such as morphine can be unbearable. Drugs widely used to ease the pain of arthritis can raise the risk of heart attacks and around one in five people who have a major operation are left in pain for several years. Professor Davletov, who reports his research in the journal Bioconjugate Chemistry, hopes the drug will cost around £1,000 a year, making it cheap enough for use on the NHS. Martin Ledwick, of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘Alongside developing new treatments for cancer, finding new and better ways of controlling pain is very important. ‘If this new approach proves to be effective and have fewer side effects, it has the potential to be extremely useful to cancer patients and others with chronic pain.’ Dr Fayyaz Ahmed, a neurologist, is a trustee for charity The Migraine Trust and chairman of the British Association for the Study of Headache. He said: ‘This sounds interesting and innovative, and if successful in what it is meant to achieve may revolutionise the way we currently treat pain and other neurological disorders.’ Many A-list celebrities, including Nicole Kidman, Jennifer Aniston, Cindy Crawford and Dannii Minogue, have admitted having Botox in the past.","New molecule created by Sheffield University's Professor Bazbek Davletov .

Guilty: Samantha Kidd changed her plea and admitted four counts of assault against her estranged husband . The estranged wife of former motorcycle stunt rider Eddie Kidd has admitted hitting the severely disabled star. Samantha Kidd, 44, pleaded guilty to four counts of assaulting her wheelchair-bound husband yesterday, including slapping him across the face and calling him a ‘complete spastic’. The former James Bond stuntman, 54, was left in a coma for three months in 1996 after suffering brain damage when a jump went wrong. He also broke his neck and pelvis. Since the accident, Mr Kidd, who has three children from previous marriages, has been confined to a wheelchair, is unable to talk or walk unaided and requires full-time care. Mrs Kidd was arrested for domestic violence in December after her husband’s family reported her to police days after the couple split up. Wearing flared jeans, a tweed blazer and her dyed red hair in curls, Mrs Kidd looked tearful as she stood in the dock and admitted the charges at Brighton Magistrates’ Court. Mr Kidd, who was previously married to Hot Gossip dancer Debbie Ash and ex-Stringfellows nightclub waitress Sarah Carr, first met his wife in 1988. They met again at a party in Mayfair in 2004, and have been  married for five years. The court heard that the former actress, who once appeared in children’s TV series Byker Grove,  assaulted her husband three times at their home in Seaford, East Sussex, and once in Southampton between July and October last year. Estranged: Samantha Kidd with husband Eddie in 2011. Mrs Kidd was arrested for domestic violence in December after her husband's family reported her to police days after the couple split up . Eddie Kidd's estranged wife was shielded by supporters as she left Brighton Magistrates' Court at an earlier hearing . Prosecutor Suzanne Soros told magistrates it was a case of ‘domestic violence’. She added: ‘The circumstances surrounding the assault in count three are that she called the victim a complete spastic. ‘She says that is because he referred to himself in that way. Although others may not be able to accept that because of his limited speech.’ She added: ‘In relation to count four, Mr Kidd was trying to reach out for the support to lift himself into bed. He brushed her [Mrs Kidd’s] face as he reached for the support. Happier times: Samantha and Eddie Kidd before it emerged they had split in December . ‘She believed at the time that he had hit her. The assault is her slapping him in retaliation. She accepts her actions were disproportionate.’ Mrs Kidd had initially denied the charges before changing her plea to guilty. She had been due to face a trial next week. Chairman of the bench Martin Reed released Mrs Kidd on bail until  sentencing next month. Marjorie Kidd, the former stuntman’s mother, said his family were relieved to learn of the last-minute guilty plea. The 76-year-old widow added: ‘I knew for a while something was wrong but I didn’t have any proof. Support: Marjorie Kidd, the mother of former stuntman Eddie Kidd, arrives at Brighton Magistrates' Court for an earlier hearing of the case . Well-known figure: Eddie Kidd raised more than £100,00 for charity when he walked the London Marathon in 2011, left with his wife Samantha and right, with a carer after they split . ‘We as a family thank God that he is . now out of this abusive relationship and away from her. She took . advantage of him and she wrecked him. ‘It was heart-breaking to watch. Our main aim now is to get him through this and back on track.’ In 2011, Mr Kidd completed the London Marathon nearly two months after setting out, and was awarded the OBE last year.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:33 EST, 21 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:09 EST, 21 July 2013 . Jailed: Pregnant Natalie Williams, 22, admitted having sex with a 14-year-old boy . A woman who took a 14-year-old boy to a hotel for sex and got him high on cannabis has been jailed for more than two years. Natalie Williams, of Darlington, was told by a judge yesterday she had preyed upon the teenager and failed to appreciate why what she had done was so wrong. The 22-year-old used a bank card he had stolen from his family to pay for the overnight hotel stay and drugs, and regularly withdrew money on it. Teesside Crown Court heard that after she was arrested, she deliberately got pregnant with a new boyfriend - thought to be an attempt to stay out of prison. But Judge Simon Bourne-Arton, QC, told her that would not dissuade him from locking her up - because a man who preyed on a young girl would face jail. He said: 'The law sets out to protect those that are under the age of consent, whether they are boys or girls, from those who would take advantage of their youth. 'They are not to be preyed upon by those who are older than them, and certainly over the age of consent, and that is why these are very serious offences.' Williams' lawyer disputed a psychologist's report saying her pregnancy was deliberate, but the judge said: 'She describes it as planned - when she was facing these proceedings.' He added: 'That shows not only a level of immaturity, but also irresponsibility... I do not take into account, in any way, that you are pregnant.' Ben Pegman, mitigating, said: 'She has been in a relationship for six months and would take issue with the proposition she puts it before the court to avoid custody. 'The sentencing guidelines greatly alarm her. She is of previous good character. I suspect the court will never see this lady again. My plea is to ask you to suspend any custodial sentence. 'She now realises he didn't have sufficient maturity, more than that, that it was unlawful. She simply hasn't thought it through. It hasn't gone through her head at the time. 'Clearly, there is an acceptance from the defendant that her behaviour was wrong. As to how much insight she has got into that, I think, it is a moot point.' Williams, of Close Street, Darlington, admitted three charges of sexual activity with a child, attempted sexual touching, fraud and handling stolen goods. Stay: Williams took the boy to the Bannatyne Hotel in Darlington using a bank card taken from his step-mother . She was jailed for a total of two years and four months. The court heard that the first sexual encounter with the schoolboy - described in court as a vulnerable virgin - was on a garden trampoline in front of a friend. The relationship came to light when the victim's stepmother realised there had been a series of unauthorised payments from her bank account and her card was missing. It emerged that tattooed Williams and the boy had spent the night at the four-star Bannatyne Hotel in Darlington, and spent more than £1,000 on the debit card. Williams was also put on the sex offenders' register for ten years and banned for life from working with children and having unsupervised contact with males aged under 18. Judge Bourne-Arton told her: 'You knew perfectly well that which you were doing was wrong. I am quite sure it was you who carried out the initiative. 'There are worrying signs you have failed to completely appreciate what impact what you did has had on him... there are deeply worrying factors in your case.'","Natalie Williams, from Darlington, preyed on the 14-year-old boy .

Sergeant Danny Nightingale in the court martial in Bulford, Wiltshire, where he is on trial charged with possession of a prohibited firearm and possession of 338 rounds of ammunition . An SAS serviceman giving evidence in the trial of sniper Danny Nightingale, claimed soldiers bringing back weapons to the UK as trophies from operations overseas was 'part of the course'. The special forces man, identified only as Soldier N, described the collecting of weapons from operational tours as 'illegal' but 'semi-okay'. Soldier N spoke about the gathering of trophy weapons as he gave evidence in the trial of SAS sniper Danny Nightingale, who is accused of having a Glock 9mm pistol and ammunition stored in his bedroom. He said he had himself brought back a . Glock 9mm pistol from Iraq, which had been given to him by an Iraqi . national as a 'gift' in 2003, but would have 'loved' to have obtained a . sniper’s rifle. He told the court he was 'not shocked' when he alleged Sergeant Nightingale, 38, told him that he also had a Glock pistol in his possession. 'I know it is illegal but it is kind of part of the course,' Soldier N said. 'You go on operations, you want to bring back a trophy, as our grandfathers did in the war. 'To bring back a trophy of some sort is kind of semi-okay.' Asked what types of weapons have been brought back from operations overseas, Soldier N replied: 'You only have to look at most sergeants’ messes... AK47s, Dragunovs. 'I’m a sniper and I would love to bring back a Dragunov as a centrepiece.' The court heard Sergeant Nightingale, 38, (with his wife Sally) had a Glock 9mm pistol stored in his wardrobe and the ammunition stashed under his bed . He described the procedures for checking military equipment coming back into the UK from abroad prior to the Op Plunder directive in 2004 as being 'reasonably relaxed'. Soldier N, who was best friends with Sgt Nightingale, was sharing a rented house with him when police acting on a tip-off about a gun searched the property in September 2011. He is currently serving a two-year period of military detention after admitting last year possessing prohibited firearms. Giving evidence for the Crown, he denied assertions by Sgt Nightingale’s barrister William Clegg QC that the pistol found in his colleague’s bedroom was in fact his. Mr Clegg asked: 'Was that Glock pistol one that you had ever been in possession of?' Soldier N replied: 'No.' Mr Clegg asked Soldier N again: 'Are you quite sure you didn’t bring both pistols back to this country?' He replied: 'I am positive.' Sgt Nightingale's family, including wife Sally and father Humphrey, were in court to support him . Mr Clegg said the witness would have received a longer sentence if he had admitted having two pistols. Soldier N replied: 'I admitted my crime and took it on the chin. One gun, two guns. As far as I was concerned I was in for a long sentence.' Soldier N, whose evidence was relayed to the public gallery in a neighbouring annexe in order to protect his identity, said he was on deployment in Afghanistan when he was informed police were going to search the house after his ex-wife told them a gun may be stored there. He described to the court martial board the moment he told Sgt Nightingale that the police were at the house. 'I said: ‘Look mate, I don’t know what is going on. I’m buggered’.' Soldier N explained that a gun and ammunition had been found among his belongings and claimed Nightingale told him: 'I’ve got the same, mate.' He told the court that he had a second conversation with Sgt Nightingale - after the defendant had spoken to his superior. 'It was a little bit confusing at first,' Soldier N said. 'He mentioned a Glock pistol. I said ""no, no that’s mine"". He said ""no mate, I have a pistol too"".' Soldier N said Sgt Nightingale did not go into the details of how the Glock came into his possession. 'It was more about the consequences of having it, with a possibility of a five year (prison) term,' he added. SAS sniper Sergeant Danny Nightingale from Crewe, Cheshire, pictured with wife Sally in March, has pleaded not guilty to a charge of possession of a prohibited firearm, namely a Glock 9mm pistol, between November 26 2007 and September 16 2011 . The court has heard that rounds of ammunition were found under Sgt Nightingale’s bed and the pistol was discovered in his wardrobe. Soldier N said that both he and Sgt Nightingale worked as range instructors and habitually stored ammunition at the rented house rather than checking it back into stores. 'Therefore, I know it’s lazy, however at the end of the day it was easier to drive home ready for the next day rather than going all the way through town etc etc, then vice versa in the morning,' he explained. Soldier N accepted there had been a 'marked change' in Sgt Nightingale after the illness in the jungle in 2009 but said he did not have memory problems over 'big topics'. The witness said he and Sgt Nightingale had been best friends but that ended in the wake of the court proceedings when he had declined to provide a statement saying he had moved the defendant’s kit from quarters at their base to the rented house they shared. Earlier, two former special services colleagues of Sgt Nightingale and Soldier N gave evidence via video link from Afghanistan where they are involved in operations. Members of the public and media were cleared from the courtroom and listened to the men’s evidence from the annexe but could not see the soldiers. The line was crackly and there was a delay of a few seconds. Sgt Nightingale, of Crewe, Cheshire, has pleaded not guilty to a charge of possession of a prohibited firearm, namely a Glock 9mm pistol, between November 26 2007 and September 16 2011. He also denies possession on or about September 16 2011 of ammunition, namely 122 9mm live rounds, 40 7.62mm live rounds, 50 9mm frangible rounds, 50 .338 armour piercing live rounds, two .308 live rounds and 74 5.56mm live rounds. Sgt Nightingale’s family, including wife Sally and father Humphrey, were in court to support him. The court martial was adjourned until tomorrow when Sgt Nightingale is expected to give evidence.

Kenan Adams-Kinard, 16, is the second teen to be arrested for the murder of Delbert Belton, who was beaten to death with flashlights in a random attack in a bar parking lot where he had arrived to play pool on Wednesday. The teen was arrested on a 1st degree robbery and 1st degree murder warrant and was brought into custody by Spokane police to join fellow suspect, 16-year-old Demetrius Glenn, who was arrested on Thursday. Several other people found with Adams-Kinard have been arrested for rendering criminal assistance to the teen during his time in hiding. He was found in a basement apartment at 500 West Montgomery in Spokane and arrested without incident at 3.00 a.m. according to KHQ.Com. Prior to his arrest, the family of Kenan had urged him to come forward and turn himself over to the police. 'He's . out there and if anybody knows where he's at or something, they really . need to contact the family because we are trying to bring him in,' said . Kenan's Dad, who wished to remain anonymous.

Scroll Down for Video . Most wanted: Police say Adams-Kinard was arrested by Spokane Police on Monday morning after a four day man-hunt . Rather than a random murder, Kenan's uncle said that he believed there was another side to the murder which has not been heard. 'They . are building it like these kids just went and beat up an old man, which . it didn't occur like that, but it is all going to come out,' Kenan's . Uncle said to KHQ.Com. Last Thursday night, police arrested Demetrius Glenn, 16, in connection to the slaying of 88-year-old Delbert Belton, who was savagely beaten with flashlights in the parking lot of his regular bar in Spokane on Wednesday. Belton, who was shot in the leg during the pivotal battle of the Pacific campaign, passed away from serious head injuries Thursday at Sacred Heart Medical Center in the city. Police told Belton's daughter-in-law, Bobby, . that he was beaten with heavy flashlights in the assault which left him . bleeding 'from every part of his face'. Witnesses to the attack said that Belton, who was going to play pool, was outside the Eagles Lodge at around 8pm when two male suspects set upon him. A friend said the veteran had just pulled up and was waiting for a female friend so she didn't have to walk in alone. Surrender: Glenn turned himself in to police custody through his lawyer . 'It . does appear random. He was in the parking lot, it appears he was . assaulted in the parking lot and there was no indication that he would . have known these people prior to the assault,' Spokane Police Major . Crimes Detective Lieutenant Mark Griffiths said. On Thursday evening, police released surveillance photos of the two suspects, Glenn and Kinard. Dark past: Adams-Kinard was convicted of third-degree theft and fourth-degree assault in June . Glenn faces a first-degree murder charge and one count of robbery. The local station KHQ reported that he will be tried as an adult. The teen has an extensive juvenile . criminal history, which includes malicious mischief, fourth-degree . assault, driving without a license and riot with a deadly weapon . charges. Adams-Kinard also has had a few run-ins with the law, The Spokesman Review reported. He was convicted of third-degree theft and fourth-degree assault in June. Police . Chief Frank Straub said Adams-Kinard should be considered a threat to . the community and should not be contacted. He urged anyone who sees him . or has information on his whereabouts to call 911 at once. Glenn turned himself in to police custody through his attorney just before 10pm Thursday. Officers noticed that the teen had an abrasion on his right hand, according to an affidavit. While being questioned by police, Glenn was asked to stand up and show what he was wearing. 'These are not the shorts from the video,' Glenn said, according to the report, apparently referring to the surveillance footage. Glenn, who spells his first name as 'Demetruis' on social media sites, described himself on his Twitter account in this manner: 'I Play Foot-ball,Run Tracc [sic],Get Money Do What i do,im a guy but i like the show keeping up with the kardashians.' Delbert 'Shorty' Belton was taken to the Intensive Care Unit of Sacred Heart after the assault at the Eagles Ice-A-Rena near Lidgerwood, but succumbed to his wounds. Wanted: Police released images of two possible suspects between the ages of 16 and 19. One juvenile was arrested this morning . Suspect Number Two: Police say two teens assaulted 88-year-old Delbert Belton outside the Eagles Lodge in North Spokane Wednesday night. One teen has been arrested in connection to the crime . Family members were today grieving for the widower, who is survived by one son Bill, 65, who is currently in hospital himself. Daughter-in-law Bobby Belton told KREM-TV she received the police call and had to break the news to her ill husband. 'They used those great, big heavy flashlights,'' she said. 'The doctor said he was bleeding from all parts of his face. 'You expect older people to die but not in that way. You just don't do those kind of things' His sister Alberta Tosh told the Spokesman Review: 'He was a good guy who would help anybody if they needed help,' she said. His great-nephew Allen Hills told KHQ that the veteran took him in and put him back on his feet when he hit rock bottom. 'It seems trivial, but he really did save my life. He made it possible for me to get a job and find work,' he said. 'He wasn't just my great-uncle. He was a great person, and he didn't deserve to die like that.' Devastated: Daughter-in-law Bobby Belton, pictured, told of her grief at the brutal killing . Tribute: Lill Duncan takes a photo of a memorial for Delbert Belton, the 88-year-old World War II veteran who was beaten to death, in Spokane . Friends were left equally outraged that the serviceman would die in such a callous way. 'He put his life on the line for our country to come home and 60 years later? Get beat to death?' his closest friend Ted Denison told the Review. 'That’s not right.' Denison who knew Belton for 23 years regularly played pool with the former soldier who went on to be an aluminum worker. He worked at Kaiser Aluminum’s Trentwood rolling mill until his retirement in 1982 but remained a skilled member of the Steelworkers Union. His wife died several years ago. 'He went up there and played pool, met with some of the guys he used to work with at Kaiser Aluminum,' he told CNN. 'It's really depressing. Seems that all there is is bad news.' Police said that Belton had just arrived with a lady-friend to play pool at the lodge when he was set upon. Tribute: Friends raised a drink to Delbert Benton in the bar he was murdered outside today . 'Those . people to me are cowards,' said Denison to KXLY.com. 'They are cowards when they . beat old people that are defenseless.... They need to be caught. Period. Because that's senseless. Beating an old man, what kind of person does . that? But a wimp to me.' 'He was always there for me when I needed him,' he added. 'We'd joke . back and forth. We were always having fun, some sort of fun.' Their outrage was mirrored online. On Twitter a campaign titled Justice for Delbert Belton was spreading this morning. Actor James Woods was one high profile supporter. 'Don't let him die without anyone caring,' read one of his many posts on the killing. The police are looking for two male suspects in the attack, with one described as heavy set and wearing all black clothing and the other as 6 feet tall and 150 pounds.","Kenan Adams Kinard, 16, was arrested on Monday morning for the murder of 88-year-old Delbert Belton .

The hot weather and low rainfall that gripped the UK in July can lead to low oxygen levels in water, leaving fish at risk of suffocation or distress, the Environment Agency said. Heavy rainfall, such as the downpours which followed the heatwave, can cause an increase in diffuse pollution and sediment washed off roads, from sewerage systems and from agricultural land, which also lowers oxygen levels. Worrying: The recent heatwave has led to tens of thousands of fish dying in rivers and lakes - with officials racing to rescue many more . Concerns: The hot weather and low rainfall which has gripped the UK can lead to low oxygen levels in water, leaving fish at risk of suffocation or distress . The Environment Agency said rapid changes in water conditions leave little time for fish to acclimatise. There were more than 15 separate incidents in July that led to almost 50,000 fish deaths as a result of the weather, while many thousands more were rescued by Environment Agency teams and partners. In Welney, Norfolk, routine monitoring revealed a significant drop in oxygen levels in the river, and the Environment Agency installed water-aerating equipment to improve conditions for the fish. At Pitville Park Lake in Cheltenham, teams worked round the clock and used specialist pumping equipment to restore oxygen levels. And in Tiptree village pond, Essex, the Environment Agency responded to reports of hundreds of fish in distress and 50 dead, and found oxygen levels down to 3 per cent.

Vile internet trolls branded murder suspect Dale Cregan a ‘legend’ yesterday as they continued to pay homage to him on twisted ‘tribute pages’. Social networking websites have been awash with comments praising one-eyed Cregan since his arrest – as well as messages attacking the two murdered policewomen. Trolls on Facebook called him ‘Sir Dale’. Last night, the website’s administrators were criticised for failing to remove the offensive content fast enough. A webpage describing murder suspect Dale Cregan as 'the greatest legend since Raoul Moat' has been put up on Facebook . Several ‘tribute’ sites were deleted . on Tuesday night but were created again yesterday morning and were live . for more than five hours. Numerous people said they had reported . the content to both Facebook and Greater Manchester Police. Julie Reid, . councillor for Gorton South in Manchester, wrote on Twitter: . ‘Absolutely disgusting Facebook page Dale Cregan Legend needs to be . taken down. Some appalling comments’. On the page entitled ‘Dale Cregan Legend’, someone wrote that Cregan was ‘the greatest legend’. The pages appeared to be set up anonymously, although some of those commenting appeared to be using their own names. Victims: PC Nicola Hughes, 23, (left) and  PC Fiona Bone, 32, (right) were killed after being attacked by gunfire and a grenade while . attending a report of a burglary in the Hattersley area of Greater Manchester . On a page entitled ‘Sir Dale Cregan Is A Hero and a Legend’, Lee McDonald wrote: ‘Haha beauty. And he only had the one eye.’ The trolls also took to Twitter, with a . man named Ricky from Dublin writing: ‘Dale  Cregan Wat A Hero . #F**kThePolice’. Tony Snow from Nottingham also tweeted ‘Dale Cregan u . legend’. The abuse started on Tuesday when . messages on Facebook referred to Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes as . ‘scumbags’. The creator of one of the pages wrote ‘So a pair of coppers . got killed who gives a ****?’ The flurry of abusive messages is called ‘trolling’, where internet users aim vile abuse at certain targets, often celebrities.

Ironically, Armageddon is going to arrive as a result of too little, rather than too much, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Currently experts are trying to find ways to cut levels of the greenhouse gas to prevent global warming running out of control. As the Sun heats up, much of the Earth will come to resemble the Upper Geyser Basin region in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, USA (pictured), scientists believe. All animals and plants will vanish from the Earth within the next billion years, a new study suggests . But as the Sun ages and grows hotter, greater evaporation and chemical reactions with rainwater will take away more and more carbon dioxide. In less than a billion years, its levels will be too low for photosynthesising plants to survive, say scientists. When that happens, life as we know it on Earth will cease to exist. With the loss of plants, herbivorous animals will also die out, as well as the carnivores that prey on them. Eventually microbes will be all that remains - and for the majority of them even their days will be numbered. After another billion years, the oceans will have dried out completely leaving only the hardiest bugs. ‘The far-future Earth will be very hostile to life by this point,’ said astrobiologist Jack O’Malley-James, from the University of St Andrews in Scotland. Astrobiologist Jack O'Malley-James' bleak prediction that Armageddon will arrive as a result of too little carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is in contrast to popular Hollywood impressions of an asteroid striking the earth . ‘All living things require liquid water, so any remaining life will be restricted to pockets of liquid water, perhaps at cooler, higher altitudes or in caves underground.’ The surviving organisms would also have to cope with extreme high temperatures and intense ultraviolet radiation, he said. Mr O’Malley-James made his bleak forecast at the National Astronomy Meeting taking place at the University of St Andrews. The predictions are based on a computer simulation of the impact long-term changes to the Sun are likely to have on Earth. As the Sun ages over the next billion years or so, it is expected to remain stable but to grow steadily brighter. The increasingly intense radiation will cause the Earth to heat up to such an extent that the oceans start to evaporate. The research may have implications for the search for extra-terrestrial life, according to Mr O’Malley-James. ‘When we think about what to look for in the search for life beyond Earth our thoughts are largely constrained by life as we know it today, which leaves behind tell-tale fingerprints in our atmosphere like oxygen and ozone,’ he said. ‘Life in the Earth’s far-future will be very different to this, which means, to detect life like this on other planets we need to search for a whole new set of clues. ‘We have now simulated a dying biosphere composed of populations of the species that are most likely to survive to determine what types of gases they would release to the atmosphere. ‘By the point at which all life disappears from the planet, we’re left with a nitrogen/carbon-dioxide atmosphere with methane being the only sign of active life.’","Astrobiologist Jack O'Malley-James says the sun will get hotter and hotter causing greater evaporation which will reduce carbon dioxide levels .
This will mean there is eventually too little CO2 for plants to survive .
When they die out, herbivores will also die out, followed by carnivores .
Microbes will then be all that remains until another billion years later when the seas will also dry out meaning very little life will remain ."

A man blew himself up in front of a seaside hotel in Tunisia today, in what is believed to be the first suicide bombing in the country. Witnesses said he had tried to enter the Riadh Palm hotel - which is popular with British tourists - in Sousse about . 90 miles south of the capital, Tunis, but was blocked by security staff. He is believed to have then detonated his bomb. No one else was hurt, according to the Interior Ministry. Tunisia had largely avoided violence, but since the country kicked off the Arab Spring by overthrowing its long-ruling secular dictatorship, it has been battered by a rising Islamist insurgency in remote parts of the country. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT. Scroll down for video . Police officers carry the body of a suicide bomber from the crime scene at a beach near the tourist resort of Sousse . A forensic unit inspects the scene where the suicide bomber blew himself up . The violence is the first in a tourist area and raises fears for the country's already troubled tourism industry. The Interior Ministry said that no one else was injured and no property was damaged. It said the bomber was a Tunisian man wearing an explosive belt. Police also arrested a man carrying explosives near the mausoleum of Habib Bourguiba, the country's first post-independence president, in the nearby city of Monastir, ministry spokesman Mohammed Ali Aroui told a local radio station. Both men appeared to belong to an extremist group, he said. Sousse has long been a major destination for European tourism, a sector that was just now recovering from a catastrophic drop following the country's 2011 revolution when holidaymakers stayed away amid the unrest. A security vacuum opened up and many . long-repressed hardline Islamic groups appeared, some of whom armed . themselves with weapons from civil war-wracked Libya to the east. The corpse of the suicide bomber lies on the beach near the tourist resort, surrounded by sun loungers and shades that are rented to tourists . A man blew himself up in front of the Riadh Palm seaside hotel in Sousse, Tunisia today (file picture). No one else was injured. It is believed to be the first suicide bombing in the country . After tolerating hardline groups such as Ansar al-Shariah, the moderate Islamist government banned them in September and began arresting members. In the past year, clashes have erupted in remote areas as authorities discovered militant hideouts. Most recently, six National Guardsmen were killed when they surrounded a house in the impoverished interior province of Sidi Bouzid and a policeman was killed in the northern town of Beja last week. There are also frequent clashes with what are described as Al Qaeda-linked jihadists holed up in mountains along the Algerian border. In February and July, prominent left-wing politicians were shot dead in front of their homes by alleged jihadists. The Sousse attack, however, appears to be the first attempt at a mass civilian casualty bombing. The ruling Ennahda party says even ultra-orthodox Islamist views must be accommodated in Tunisia's fledgling democracy. Above Ennahda's leader, Rached Ghannouchi . Since the 2011 uprising, Islamists have pressed for strict Sharia law to be imposed in one of the Muslim world's most secular countries, which has strong ties to Europe. Oppressed and jailed under Ben Ali, conservative Salafists - followers of a puritanical strain of Sunni Islam - have had more freedom to express their fundamentalist views since 2011. But violent, hardline Islamists have also attacked alcohol sellers, art shows and theatre plays they say are against Islam, and have taken over mosques. The rise to power of an elected Islamist-led government has fuelled fears of many secular Tunisians that women's rights and liberal educational traditions may be eroded. The ruling Ennahda party says even ultra-orthodox Islamist views must be accommodated in Tunisia's fledgling democracy, but that there is no place for armed militants. Authorities say the militants have acquired weapons and training in neighbouring Libya, where the central government has failed to impose order since the 2011 fall of Muammar Gaddafi. Ennahda accused Ansar al-Sharia militants of being behind the assassination of two secular opposition leaders this year. Those attacks set off months of protests from opposition supporters who said Ennahda had been too lenient on hardline Islamists. Ennahda has agreed to step down within the next three weeks to end the unrest and allow a caretaker government to govern until elections. Ansar al-Sharia was also blamed for inciting an attack on the U.S. embassy a year ago, when Islamist protesters stormed the building. The group's leader is a former Al Qaeda veteran who once fought in Afghanistan. Nine Tunisian policemen were killed in clashes with militants earlier this month in two different cities.","Exploded outside Riadh Palm hotel, popular with British holidaymakers, in Sousse .

A 12-year-old Florida boy has succumbed to a rare and deadly brain-eating amoeba, the child's family announced Saturday. Zachary Reyna had been trying to fight the infection caused by the amoeba with antibiotics, but was unable to beat it, passing away at 1:54pm Saturday, according to an announcement on the Facebook page set up by his family. Reyna's family had held out hope he would survive after recently announcing the amoeba was gone, but doctors feared he may have suffered severe brain damage had he survived. Hope: Zachary, pictured with his sister, has managed to fight off the infection . 'Wake up child it's YOUR TIME TO SHINE! Continued prayers please #pray4number4 #wakeupzac #prayer #powerofprayer,' Zachary's sister Amanda tweeted Saturday morning. It was not long after that her brother passed away. 'At 1:54 today there was a crack of a bat heard. Zac took it deep. My boy hit his homerun. One that I'll never forget,' the boy's devastated father wrote. 'I'm so proud of him. He left it all on the field and I can't ask for more. He did so well that he'll be the starting 2nd baseman for The Lords team.' Zachary Reyna''s plight has caught the attention of Florida and the rest of the U.S. The Facebook page set up looking for donations to help pay for the suffering young boy has more than 10,000 likes, with baseball players and celebrities including Taylor Swift sending presents and messages of support. Improvement in Zachary's condition was highlighted by his father on the page, and based on the hope that he will be the fourth person to survive the amoeba. 'We were told this morning that the antibiotics have defeated the infection. Tests showed negative activity from the amoeba,' Jesse Reyna wrote Thursday. Sadly, that hope was short-lived. Zachary fell critically ill . after playing on a knee board with friends in a ditch near his LaBelle, . Florida home on August 3. Fighter: Zachary Reyna is in intensive care after contracting a rare infection from a deadly amoeba . Risks: Zachary is being treated in hospital, above, for an infection only three people are known to have survived . If he recovers from the infection caused by the brain-eating amoeba he will be only the four person to have survived. The . single cell Naegleria Fowleri or brain-eating amoeba, lives in warm . fresh water and attacks the brain after entering the body through the . nose, according to Naples News. On Wednesday last week, five pastors and hundreds of residents met at LaBelle Veteran's Memorial Park for the vigil. Donations were taken by organizer Susan Whidden, who lives in the area and works at Seacoast National Bank, on behalf of the family, The Miami Herald reported. A LaBell resident, Mr Bares, told the Herald: 'When something happens close to home we really come together. That's why I love living in a small town.' A Facebook page has been set up for Zachary Reyna, named pray4number4, to help raise donations . Died too soon: Reyna's father posted this heartbreaking message Saturday to the Facebook page announcing his son's death . Doctors don't know why some people . who swim in amoeba-containing water become infected in their nervous . system, while others don't. In the past 50 years only 31 have contracted the rare primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (Pam) infection, and only three have survived so far. Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis is as rare as it is horrific. It is caused by an amoeba that implants itself in its victim's brains - usually when infected water shoots up their nose. The amoeba grows in the sediment at the bottom of pools of warm, stagnant water and is most active at about 85F. The water must reach a relatively high temperature for the parasites to reach numbers that threaten humans. Health officials have recorded only 125 instances of the disease in the United States in the past 50 years. Only two people have survived in the U.S. One other survivor was found in Mexico . Swimmers can reduce their risk by: . 'He can be number four. That's what we're hoping for, for him to be number four,' Zachary's brother, Brandon Villarreal, said. The . family first noticed there was something seriously wrong with Zachary . after he slept for a whole day after playing with friends on August 3. At . first they thought he had a 24 hour virus, but soon realized there was . something seriously wrong with the usually active, baseball loving . child. The family kept a vigil by his bedside at Miami Children's Hospital, where Zachary had been sedated. '[It] . will actually eat away at the tissue; it literally eats the tissues,' Dr Mark Heulitt told KATV. 'It is a severe form of meningitis where your . brain will be eaten by the amoeba.' Swimmers have been warned to be careful in still water around Florida, as health officials try to prevent further infections. The amoeba is common in warm, stagnant water in central Florida, especially in the summer. Health officials have advised swimmers and water skiers to wear nose clips as a safety precaution because it cuts off the only way the amoeba can enter the body and do damage. A Department of Health spokesman told MailOnline the water must to be forcefully, almost violently, pushed up the nose - as it can be after diving into the water, being dunked or using a water slide. Three boys, aged between 10 and 14, developed the infection last year after wakeboarding or swimming. Mark Zeitler, whose nephew of Will Sellers, who died from the infection last year, has warned people to stay away from water in the summer. 'We're not trying to be alarmists, but . as that water heats up, find other places to recreate,' Mr Zeitler told . the Orlando Sentinel. Warning signs: Zachary's family realized he was sick when the usually active child could not stop sleeping . It can take up to a week for the infection to show symptoms, which include headaches, fever, vomiting and seizures. A 12-year-old girl who developed the condition in July is still recovering after managing to fight off the infection. Kali Hardig came in contact with the amoeba as she swam in a sandy bottom lake at Willow Springs Water Park near Little Rock, Arkansas. All Zachary Reyna's parents can do now is fondly remember their budding all-star. 'I sit back and ask myself, what would make me prouder; my son playing pro ball, being a successful business man or being known for changing and saving thousands of lives,' Reyna's mourning father wrote on the Facebook page, continuing 'I hope that Zac continues to touch people and his time here is remembered forever. We thank everyone for being so caring... the battle is over for Zac but he won the war.' Reyna's parents also announced Saturday that they plan to donate his organs saying 'even though Zac has passed, he will still be saving many lives.'","Zachary Reyna died Saturday afternoon .

"By . Jaya Narain . UPDATED: . 16:06 EST, 7 November 2011 . The family of a convicted terrorist could lose their home after police enacted anti-terror laws to seize the property. Munir Farooqi, 54, was jailed in September after attempting to recruit two undercover police officers for jihad in Afghanistan. Now in the first case of its kind his £200,000 property could be confiscated because he turned it into a secret Al Qaeda recruiting school. Convicted: Munir Farooqi, left, was found . guilty of soliciting multiple murder and a series of terrorism offences, . while Matthew Newton, who Farooqi recruited, was convicted of preparing . acts of terrorism and distributing terrorist publications . But Farooqi’s outraged family say they . are entitled to a private and family life and will use the Human Rights . Act to fight the move. Under Clause 23a of the Terrorism Act . 2000 a convicted terrorist can have their assets seized by the state . under a forfeiture order. Next year a court will decide whether the property was used as a base to commit the offences. Farooqi, a market trader, used his stall in Manchester as a front to persuade people to join a holy ‘Jihad’ war against the UK. Targeting young British men, he used . literature and films to brainwash them, successfully converting a former . British soldier and an estate agent. Over a two year period Farooqi - who . boasted of being a jihadist and was detained in Afghanistan in 2001- . tried to persuade people visiting his stall to travel to training camps . in Afghanistan. Seized: Police want to use anti terror laws to seize the family home (pictured) in Longsight, Manchester . He was arrested in November 2009 after . two white undercover policemen infiltrated the recruiting school and . underwent radicalisation ceremonies in the basement of his terraced . home. Under Clause 23a of the Terrorism Act 2000 a convicted terrorist can have their assets seized by the state under a forfeiture order . The act states the court can order any property or money to be forfeited if it was in the possession or control of the convicted person, used for terrorism purposes, intended for the use of terrorism, or if they court believes it will be used for the purposes of terrorism . During the undercover investigation . one of the detectives taped Farooqi boasting: ‘If we die, we win. You . have Allah on your side, how can we lose? ‘You know Jihad is not about you . giving your life away. If we’re going to go there you make sure you take . at least 40 or 50 people with us so we’ve done something.’ In September Farooqi was convicted of . three charges of soliciting murder, preparing for acts of terrorism and . distributing terrorists publications after a four month trial. He was . jailed for a minimum of nine years. Recruiting ground: Farooqi used Longsight Market in Manchester to sell fanatical Islamic manuals, books and DVDs and target young British men . Police say that because the majority . of these acts took place at his terraced home in Longsight then Farooqi . should forfeit the property. Farooqi, who was born in Pakistan and . came to the UK in 1962, became an active supporter of the Taliban in . Afghanistan and went there in 2001 after the attacks on the twin towers . of the World Trade Centre. He was captured by authorities and jailed from November 2001 but was released in May 2002 and returned to the UK. The Farooqi family say five adults and . two children - including an eight-month-old baby - will be made . homeless if the police and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) go ahead with . the forfeiture order. They have branded the move a ‘collective punishment’ and are set to hand a 5,000-name petition to officials in Manchester today. Proven: Munir Farooqi was handed four life sentences for soliciting mass murder at Manchester Crown Court . Farooqi’s daughter Zulaika, 28, said: . ‘Leaving three generations of a family homeless, including an . eight-month-old baby, is disgusting. It’s not British law, it’s just . wrong and inhumane. ‘We have so much public support . against this, not just from the Muslim community but also from . non-Muslims too. This is not just a Muslim issue.’ His son Harris, 27, who was cleared . of terror charges, said: ‘The women and two children in the house are . totally innocent and should not be punished. We shouldn’t face . collective punishment. This law has never been used against anyone . before.’ The family’s solicitor Saeed Hafezi . said: ‘It was never the intention of Parliament for applications to be . made in this way. It is the family home and will continue to be.’ Human rights activist Naila Ashraf . said: ‘It is totally unacceptable for the law, the police and the Crown . Prosecution Service to criminalise a whole family like this. The UK is . supposed to be a democratic country, do we really want to go down this . route?’ But police have insisted the case was . about seizing the property not evicting the family as the house was . asset used for the purposes of terrorism. Assistant Chief Constable Dawn Copley . said: ‘The majority of these acts took place at 6 Victoria Terrace, the . Farooqi family home. ‘The Terrorism Act 2000 makes it clear . that in certain circumstances, forfeiture proceedings can be brought . against those convicted of terrorist offences. ‘If it can be shown to a court that . Munir Farooqi was in possession or control of a property used for the . purposes of terrorism, a court may make a forfeiture order for that . property.’ She said: ‘We know this is an emotive . issue within our community and we have met regularly with . representatives from local mosques, elected members and others to hear . their views.'","First time in British history police used terror laws to try and seize property .

Andy Lopez was shot seven times in a Santa Rosa parking lot by Sonoma County Sheriff's Deputy Erick Gelhaus after police received reports of a suspicious person.

According to the Press Democrat, Santa Rosa police Lieutenant Paul Henry said that within seconds Gelhaus ordered the teenager to drop the weapon before his partner could take cover behind the open door of the vehicle. The account seems to back up eyewitness claims and dispatch records that claim that only ten seconds elapsed between Gelhaus confronting Lopez and shooting him. Andy Lopez was killed by police earlier this month . The latest development comes as protestors continue to call for Gelhaus to face charges over the shooting. Lieutenant Henry told the Press Democrat: 'Deputy Gelhaus was able to engage more quickly because he didn't have to drive the vehicle. 'By the time (Gelhaus's partner) had exited his door and taken cover, at that point Deputy Gelhaus had already engaged the subject, with the commands and with the weapon. 'The threat was essentially over.' Police also revealed that Lopez was wearing a hooded sweatshirt but had the hood down and was not wearing headphones that might have affected his hearing. The patrol car Gelhaus and his partner were using was not equipped with either audio or video recording equipment. Yesterday hundreds of demonstrators marched to protest the fatal shooting which has sparked community outrage and an FBI investigation.

Oneida Indian Nation members yesterday called on the National Football League to use its authority to force the Washington Redskins football team to change its controversial name. Representatives from the Oneida Nation met in New York City on Wednesday with the NFL and Washington Redskins officials. But, seemingly like their counterparts in Washington's Congress, the three parties could not come to any agreement on the issue of the football team's name. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Oneida Indian Nation representative Ray Halbritter called on the NFL to force the Washington Redskins to change its controversial name. The Oneida claim there should be an NFL bylaw prohibiting any term using a racial epithet. Halbritter said the dictionary defines the word ""redskins"" precisely like that . The roadblock is caused by Redskins' owner Daniel Snyder's refusal to change the name, Oneida's refusal to back down from their claim the name is offensive, and the NFL's apparent refusal to take a stand on the issue. 'We requested that the commissioner use his authority to refer Daniel Snyder to the league for possible sanction over the continued use of the term,' said Oneida representative Ray Halbritter, referring to the Redskins owner, according to ABC News. 'If the commissioner lacks the power to act, he should publicly say so.' 'Despite ridiculous assertions to the contrary, the use of the R-word is not a unifying force nor does it convey respect. It is the very word our people heard when they were dragged by gunpoint off their land and dragged onto reservations,' Halbritter said. Who moves next? Washington Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins in action for his team. Redskins owner Daniel Snyder said the controversial name will stay . The NFL said the meeting was part of an 'on-going dialogue' on the issue. 'We listened and respectfully discussed the views of Mr. Halbritter, Oneida Nation Wolf Clan Representative Keller George and their colleagues as well as the sharply differing views of many other Native Americans and fans in general,' a statement from the NFL said. 'The meeting was part of an ongoing dialogue to facilitate listening and learning, consistent with the commissioner's comments earlier this year.' Oneida Nation representatives called on NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, pictured here, to use his 'authority' to force the Redskins to change its name. Goodell met with franchise owner Daniel Snyder on Tuesday but reportedly discussed tactics on how to handle the issue not a decision . Redskins owner Daniel Snyder met with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell on Tuesday but did not discuss plans to change the name, according to reports of the meeting. Snyder remains firm that the name will not be changed, recently writing a letter to team fans that claimed the name 'was, and continues to be, a badge of honor.' 'I’ve listened carefully to the commentary and perspectives on all sides, and I respect the feelings of those who are offended by the team name,' Snyder wrote. 'But I hope such individuals also try to respect what the name means, not only for all of us in the extended Washington Redskins family, but among Native Americans too.' Oneida nation representatives called for Goodell, Snyder, and other top NFL executives to again meet during the week of the Superbowl in 2014 and to visit Indian reservations to see first-hand how the term 'Redskins' affects Oneida Nation members. 'We will not be silent on this issue and it's not going to go away, not this time,' Halbritter said. 'This strikes at the heart of the issue of what kind of future our children will have.' Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder, pictured, claims he has no plans to change the Redskins name. The team was founded as the Boston Braves in 1932 before renaming in 1933 after a name clash with a baseball team with the same name. The team moved to Washington, DC, in 1937 . The controversy has spread to how some media organizations now refer to the NFL team. The San Francisco Chronicle is the latest in a growing list of publications to stop using the term 'Redskins' when it refers to Washington's National Football League team. Managing Editor Audrey Cooper announced on Wednesday that the newspaper's style council decided to eliminate the term because of a long-standing policy against using racial slurs. The use of the Redskins name is being contested in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in an attempt to block its use. Suzan Shown Harjo, an Indian rights activist, said claims the Redskins name was part of the team's heritage was flawed. 'Part of that heritage and tradition is name-calling, belittling and maligning Native Peoples,' Harjo said. 'The n-word was traditional and had quite a heritage, too. Happily, not all traditions are carried on forever.' The Washington Redskins were known as the Boston Braves in 1932, their inaugural year. They played in Fenway Park in Boston, also home at the time to baseball teams the Boston Braves (now the Atlanta Braves) and current World Series champions, the Boston Red Sox. To avoid confusion with the baseball Braves, the football team changed its name to the Redskins the following year. The team moved to Washington in 1937.","Manhattan meeting makes no progress in name dispute between team owner and American Indians .

Joe Biden's niece allegedly told police officers 'you don't know who I am' when she was arrested following a fight with her roommate which landed her in jail. According to court documents, Caroline Biden, said: 'I shouldn't be handcuffed! You don't know who you're doing this to.' The 26-year-old was arrested at her luxury apartment in Tribeca, New York, on September 17 after she allegedly went mad at her roommate over unpaid rent. On her way out: Caroline Biden's right eye had a visible bruise when she appeared at Manhattan Criminal Court on October 29 in response to charges filed against her during a September 17 altercation . Trying to hide: Biden, the Vice President's 26-year-old niece, used sunglasses to keep her bruise under wraps . She was spotted with a . very visible black eye during her Tuesday court appearance though it is . not clear if that stems from the September 17 altercation that landed . her in police custody. Biden is charged with resisting arrest, obstructing governmental administration and harassing a former roommate. Friends of the young woman revealed after that she had begun to 'unravel' as a result of the pressure of being related to the Vice President. Little is known about the specific fight that lead to police being called to her Tribeca apartment- including the identity of her roommate- but now the newly-released police report details how she did not leave the scene quietly. Avoiding a spectacle: Caroline Biden was wrapped in a bedsheet when she was transported from the Tribeca police precinct to the awaiting ambulance on Tuesday morning . The New York Post reports that she tried to hit one of the responding officers who showed up at her apartment during the fight. The paper cites court documents that describe how she also tried to sneak out of the station house once officers put her inside a holding cell. 'I am informed that Officer Martin had to outstretch both of his arms horizontally so the defendant could not get around him and that the defendant stated in substance, ""Don’t touch me,"" and attempted to push away from Officer Martin,' an officer wrote in the criminal complaint. 'I am informed by Officer Martin that he was able to gain control of the defendant by holding her arm and that when he was walking her back to the holding cell, the defendant grabbed a door frame, and held onto cells, in an effort to prevent Officer Martin from bringing her back to the holding cell, an official function.' Questions remain: Police officials confirmed to MailOnline that she was transported to Beth Israel hospital but they did not have any information about what caused her to seek medical treatment following her fight with a roommate . Her Tuesday court appearance was a pre-trial hearing and the next date in the case is when her lawyers have to report back on December 17, but she is not required for that appearance. This is not Miss Biden's first run-in with the law, as she was briefly detained by Amtrak police over a disputed train fare in 2009. At the time she claimed she was treated unfairly because of her family's connection to the Vice President, and said she had intended to pay for her ticket on the train, a friend said. The most recent altercation took place at her luxury apartment. Her father James, who is the brother of the vice President, paid the deposit for the apartment she was renting from NYU student Anne Marie Yacopetti. Miss Yacopetti's mother claimed the gallery worker would pay the rent she owed, 'when she feels like it' and added: 'If you’re an elitist Biden, I guess you think you’re owed the world.' Pressure: A former friend previously said that Caroline was 'unraveling' because of the expectations put upon her and her family due to her uncle's role as Vice President . Shortly after the arrest last month, one of her former friends weighed in on the situation. 'The pressure of being Joe Biden’s niece made her totally unravel. it’s a desire for attention, a cry for help,' socialite Paul Johnson Calderon told The Post. He described the Georgetown University graduate as a 'hot mess' and likened her to actress Amanda Bynes. 'She’s surrounded by a lot of people who use her because of who she is. Guys would want to date her because of who her ­uncle is,' Mr Calderon told the Post from a sober-living facility. He added that he ended their friendship because he is dealing with an alcohol addiction. Miss Biden, who works at Higher Pictures gallery in New York, also went to rehab for alcohol and Adderall addiction while at university, another friend claimed.","Caroline Biden was arrested after getting into a screaming fight with her roommate in their Tribeca apartment on September 17 .

With her long serge habit, make-up-free face and closely cropped hair hidden by a traditional wimple, she appears indistinguishable from her fellow Benedictine nuns. Sister John Mary is devoted to a never-ending ritual of worship and work at her convent with the 36 sisters who follow the Rule of St Benedict on an isolated 400-acre farm. It’s a life she was called to but it is hardly one the 44-year-old glamorous blonde seemed destined for when she worked in London at Conservative Party HQ - with her ambitious young boyfriend David Cameron. The ex who found God: Sister John Mary features in new documentary God is the Bigger Elvis . Sister John Mary’s real name is Laura . Adshead. She is a former pupil of £24,000-a-year Cheltenham Ladies’ College, from where she went up to Oxford - meeting Mr Cameron when they . were young undergraduates. Laura . dated him from the spring of 1990 until summer 1991, and while he . worked at Conservative Central Office, she went on to become the then . Prime Minister John Major’s correspondence secretary. Then . their lives took different turns. Mr Cameron was selected for political . stardom, while Laura left politics to study at the Wharton business . school in Philadelphia. She . became an executive in Manhattan for Ogilvy & Mather, the . advertising agency that inspired the television drama Mad Men - but the . stresses of success, and, perhaps, of personal rejection, finally proved . too much for her. She descended into a world of drinking . and addiction before finally finding salvation in God at the abbey in . the Connecticut hills, three hours north of New York City. New life: Laura at the abbey, in smart dress and pearls, before becoming Sister John Mary . ‘I . did think my life would progress on the normal tracks of meeting . someone, marrying, having children, but that’s not the path that God has . led me,’ Sister John Mary says in a new documentary revealing her . story. Photographs are shown of her when she was a young woman, posing in a leopard-skin top, dragging on a cigarette and savouring a glass of wine. But she admits that her lifestyle then brought her little except loneliness. She says: ‘I feel like I tried most things in life that are supposed  to make you happy. That journey took me down into alcoholism and  drug addiction.’ It has been suggested that her downward spiral may have started soon after her break-up from the future Prime Minister. In a 2007 biography of Cameron, a former colleague of the pair at Conservative headquarters recalled Laura being granted a ‘period of compassionate leave’ to recover from the heartbreak. Past life: Laura before she found God . The authors say Mr Cameron was also . shaken by the split and its aftermath, and add: ‘Perhaps as a result of . the fall-out from his affair with Adshead, Cameron thereafter dated . women outside politics.’ Laura later went out with the historian Andrew Roberts, one of Mr Cameron’s friends. When . she moved to New York to work as a strategic planning director at . Ogilvy & Mather, she found herself part of a social whirl that . included aristocratic Europeans and American trust fund heirs. Newspaper . diaries chronicled her presence at society events - at one polo match . she mingled with Prince Albert of Monaco, Estee Lauder’s granddaughter, . Aerin, and a billionaire polo-playing friend of Prince Charles, Peter . Brant, who is married to model Stephanie Seymour. She spent freely, renting a £15,000-a-month summer home with pool and tennis court in the exclusive enclave of The Hamptons on Long Island, regarded as the summer seaside playground of America’s wealthy elite. But by 2008 she had apparently become overwhelmed by problems with substance abuse, and declared that she had decided to become a nun. She recalls: ‘I remember having to tell my mother, “I’m going to join the abbey,’’ and she said, “Yes, I can see this world has no real meaning for you any more.’’ I looked at this place and saw women who had what I wanted. ‘You make a decision here to surrender your life to God.’ Laura seems to have embraced the lifestyle wholeheartedly. The film shows the formal ceremony that  she went through in order to join the order of nuns. She is seen dressed in a smart fuchsia . dress and knotted pearls - then happily allowing the sisters to untwist . her long blonde hair from a bun and cut it back. A wimple is then placed around her head before she is introduced to the congregation by her new name. ‘This is the only place I could see myself being - because this is where it’s at,’ she says. She is seen at prayer, weeping with . emotion. ‘She really is committed to the abbey,’ said a source who met . her at a service to which the public were admitted. ‘Her mother and . sister were at the service. The nuns chanted in Latin. It was very . beautiful.’ Last week, . answering a telephone call from The Mail on Sunday, the convent’s . porter, Mother Deborah Joseph, described how, as a novice, Laura must go . through an apprenticeship known as ‘formation’. Laura took her vows four years ago, but formation lasts for as long as five-and-a-half years. Only at the end of this apprenticeship will she be eligible to take holy orders and assume the title of ‘Mother’. Ex: David Cameron in 1987, during his time at Oxford . Asked whether Sister John Mary could speak, Mother Joseph said she was too busy to come to the phone, explaining: ‘She’s out of the house and on the land. She’ll be busy until Vespers.’ To outsiders, the regime at the Abbey of Regina Laudis may seem harsh. The first bell of the day rings at 2am to announce Matins. Then it clangs at first light, again at 8am for Mass and then at regular intervals until Vespers, at 5pm. Chores for interns such as Laura include mopping the chapel floors, tending a herd of dairy cattle and scrubbing the pails that senior nuns use to churn butter. Laura is embracing the lifestyle, despite the apparent hardships. ‘A monastic life, this is where the struggle is,’ Laura says in the film. ‘There’s no way out. You don’t get to leave and go to a movie. ‘You don’t get distraction from  all the human emotions. It’s like  this hothouse where things get worked out.’ The film featuring Laura is called God Is The Bigger Elvis, the title referring to the convent’s Prioress Mother Dolores and her former life, which was also glamorous. She is a one-time Hollywood starlet, Dolores Hart, who appeared with Elvis Presley in two of his films, Lovin’ You and King Creole, before entering the order in 1963.

Sighting: Morag Ritchie said she saw the UFO hovering over her house in Aberdeenshire for four hours . Morag said: ‘We live in a very rural area so I never have my curtains closed and I like looking at the night sky. ‘I just woke up all of a sudden and . looked out of the window to see all these twinkling lights - they looked . like they were moving. ‘I was quite apprehensive about it. I’m standing there looking at it and I’m thinking “is it watching me?”, so I went around the house telling everyone and they all came to have a look.' Mrs Ritchie describes seeing a circular object hovering and spinning around above her home in Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire. ‘My husband is a fisherman and he’s . spent many hours looking up at the night sky, so he was quite sceptical . when I told him, but even he admitted it was strange when he saw them.' Right there: Morag Ritchie in their back garden pointing towards the part of the sky where she saw the UFO on Saturday night . She says: ‘Eventually we all went back to bed. I . woke up a further two times, the second time was about four hours later . and it was still there, but when I next woke up it was daylight and . they had gone. ‘It was there for so long that even . all the way out here, someone else must have seen it, but perhaps . they’ve been too shy to come forward about it.'

A woman with a severe nut allergy has had her life miraculously changed after being paired with the first dog in Europe trained to sniff out allergies. Yasmine Tornblad can go into anaphylactic shock from just the smell of nuts and has been rushed into hospital more than 15 times in the last eight years. But now she takes four-year-old poodle Nano everywhere she goes - including the office, business trips, flights and hotels around the world. Something in the air: Even the smell of nuts is enough to send Yasmine Tornblad into anaphylactic shock. She can breathe easy now with Nano the poodle by her side - Europe's first trained 'nut sniffer dog' 'It has given me a bit of independence back so I’m not so worried about eating at friend’s houses or going on business trips anymore,' said Yasmine, from Malvern, Worcestershire. 'Normally when I stay at a hotel I start by cleaning out the room to be sure there is no contamination - now I have Nano to double-check. I can’t imagine life without him now.' The clever pup has spent a year being trained by the charity Medical Detection Dogs, which is based in Milton Keynes, Bucks. Nano can now detect nut odours in both food and the environment and at Yasmine’s work he will sniff them out on colleagues’ desks and in their drawers or handbags. Puppy love: Yasmine - who has suffered over 20 anaphylactic shocks - says having the four-year-old doggie detective around has changed her life . 'If a new laptop [bag] comes into the office I will put it on the floor and get Nano to sniff it to make sure it is free from nuts,' said Yasmine, who is in her 30s and works in IT. 'If he detects traces of nuts on it I then clean it or swap with someone else. Having Nano around has made my life so much easier.' Yasmine first developed a nut allergy as a child and would react by getting swollen eyes and an itchy throat. But the allergy appeared to disappear until suddenly on a business trip to China eight years ago she reacted and went into anaphylactic shock. A few weeks later the same thing happened on a business trip to Germany and after attending an allergy clinic she discovered she was allergic to walnuts, cashew nuts and peanuts. Since then she has gone into anaphylactic shock more than 20 times and often ended up in A&E. 'I would usually take a tablet and if that didn’t work I would use an epipen or call an ambulance and go straight to hospital,' she said. 'I would always be super careful whenever I travelled and if friends invited me to dinner it was often easier not to go.' Then two years ago she saw a programme on television about dogs in Canada who had been trained to sniff out peanuts and she started contacting UK charities to see if anyone could provide one. 'I heard back from Medical Detection Dogs who said they may be able to help and they linked me up with Nano. It was so exciting,' she said. 'He spent a year getting to know me and my office and home and then a further year being trained by the charity. Nano spent a year getting to know Yasmine in her office and home then a further year being trained by the charity Medical Detection Dogs . 'I would highly recommend a dog like Nano to anyone in the same position as me.' Medical Detection Dogs has already paired up more than 30 dogs with people who have to manage a condition, like diabetes, so they can respond in an emergency. It has also previously taught dogs to sniff out cancer and dogs can now pick out cancer samples from control samples. Simone Brainch, from Medical Detection Dogs, said it has already had enquiries from people with similar stories to Yasmine. She added: 'The difference it can make to a client who is suffering from a condition like this is very exciting.'","Yasmine Tornblad has an extreme allergy to walnuts, peanuts and cashews .

Accused: American tour guide Kenneth Bae faces the death penalty in North Korea for allegedly photographing starving orphans . An American tour guide faces the death penalty in North Korea after allegedly taking photographs of orphans begging in the street. Kenneth Bae was arrested in November while leading a group of tourists through the rogue state's Rason Special Economic Zone and later admitted to committing 'crimes aimed to topple the DPRK,' according to a Korean news agency. The exact reasons for his arrest have not been confirmed by North Korea but sources in the country say he is accused of photographing starving children. Identified in North Korea’s state media by his Korean name, Pae Jun Ho, Mr Bae is a tour operator of Korean descent. He is the sixth American detained in the secretive country since 2009. The other Americans were eventually deported or released after high-profile diplomatic interventions, including some involving former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. Analysts say the North will likely soon hand Mr Bae a harsh punishment to use him as a bargaining chip in possible negotiations with the United States.

But his friends, colleagues and South Korean activists specializing in North Korea affairs said he is a Christian missionary based in a Chinese border town who frequently made trips to North Korea to feed orphans there. It is not known whether he tried to evangelize while in North Korea. Officially, North Korea guarantees freedom of religion. In practice, authorities crack down on Christians, who are seen as Western-influenced threats to the government. The distribution of Bibles and secret prayer services can mean banishment to a labor camp or execution, defectors from the country have said.","Kenneth Bae was arrested while leading tour group near Chinese border .

Hallmark has provoked outrage and ridicule from its customers after changing the words of a traditional Christmal carol on a festive ornament. The gaudy, red sweater ornament has dropped the word 'gay' for the word 'fun' in the lyric from the 19th-century carol Deck The Halls. The original line - 'Don we now our gay apparel' - has been altered by the Kansas-City based company for its new line of holiday merchandise. It now reads: 'Don we now our FUN apparel.' Break from tradition: Hallmark released this sweater ornament as part of its holiday line, changing the words of carol Deck The Halls to: 'Don we now our FUN apparel!' The ornament of the holiday sweater, decorated with bells, bow and priced at $12.95, is described as: 'When it comes to Christmas sweaters, gaudy can be good! Hang up this flashy sweater to make your tree's outfit complete. 'With its catchy phrase, Don we now our FUN apparel! everyone will be in on the joke.' Deck the Halls is a traditional Christmas carol with the tune dating back to 16th century Wales when it was called Nos Galan. The English lyrics were composed by the Scottish musician Thomas Oliphant in the late 19th century (although the 'fa la la' comes from the original Welsh). Carols were originally intended to be dances and not songs - and initially frowned upon by the church. Deck The Halls first appeared in the Pennsylvania School Journal in 1877 and was described as a 'Welsh air'. It has remained popular during the holidays ever since. In 1999, country music group SHeDAISY released a version of the song for Disney film Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas. Deck The Halls is also the title of a 2006 comedy starring Danny DeVito, Matthew Broderick and Kristin Davis. However the break with the traditional carol sparked anger among Hallmark customers who took to the company's Facebook page to complain. Val Buoni posted on Thursday: 'Hallmark has just made my boycott list for the idiotic change of lyrics in Deck the Halls. I will NEVER purchase anything from Hallmark again. 'Furthermore your ridiculous attempt at political correctness assumes that homosexuals dress differently. So you've alienated Christians as well as homosexuals.....good job Hallmark.' Paul J Kettle Jr added: 'I . am disturbed to hear that you have removed the long-standing word ""gay"" from your ornament. Had you not taken the politically-motivated . stance, nobody would have noticed or complained. 'Now, you have brought . this to the fore you are attracting attention, mostly negative. I have . used Hallmark exclusively for cards over many years, but I am thinking . now of migrating to another brand.' Customer Thomas F Reynolds blasted the company: 'We just cut up our gold crown card we have had forever. Keep rewriting Christmas carols and you will end up filing for bankruptcy. Disgraceful!' In a statement today, the company said: . 'Hallmark created this year's Holiday Sweater ornament in the spirit of . fun. When the lyrics to ""Deck the Halls"" were translated from Gaelic and . published in English back in the 1800s, the word ""gay"" meant festive or . merry. Hallmark customers were quick to post their outrage on the company's Facebook page on Thursday . Another Hallmark customer with a gold crown rewards card slammed the retailer for their decision to change a Christmas carol . Today it has multiple meanings, which we thought could leave our intent open to misinterpretation. The trend of wearing festively decorated Christmas sweaters to parties is all about fun, and this ornament is intended to play into that, so the planning team decided to say what we meant: ""fun."" 'That's the spirit we intended and the spirit in which we hope ornament buyers will take it.'","Lyric from the 19th century carol has been changed to: 'Don we now our FUN apparel'

Apple's eagerly anticipated new smartphone, the iPhone 5S, could be 31 percent faster than the current iPhone 5 model, according to rumours.

Apple's eagerly anticipated new smartphone, the iPhone 5S could be 31 percent faster than the current iPhone 5 model, according to rumours. According to a TV anchor, the iPhone 5S will include a fast A7 processor to make the phone noticeably faster than the latest model currently available (pictured) Clayton Morris of Fox News tweeted: 'Sources are telling me the new iPhone's A7 chip is running at about 31% faster than A6. I’m hearing it’s very fast.' According to 9to5Mac Apple is testing 64-bit A7 processors in its prototypes, which would give the phone much better performance per watt and let it handle animated graphics more smoothly. If the company can deliver a faster smartphone, it will once again put them on a level pegging with Samsung's popular high-end smartphones. Experts have speculated that the same processor will probably be included in the next iPad. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, recently told the news site that the transition to the new, faster processor will probably happen soon. If the company can deliver a faster smartphone, it will once again put them on a level pegging with Samsung's popular high-end smartphones. The phone is also rumoured to boast a fingerprint sensor to identify the owner, a slow-motion camera with dual flash and could even be gold-coloured (like this treated iPhone 5) However, Mashable reported many people believe that . while the chips are rumoured to be in testing, there is no solid . evidence to suggest that they will be launched this year. If not, many Apple fans hope a 64-bit A8 processor will be launched early in 2014. Insiders believe the new phone - along with a low-cost handset dubbed the iPhone C - will be unveiled next month with the event rumoured to be taking place on September 10. Mr Morris said: 'I’ve also heard there’s a separate chip devoted to motion tracking. Should be an interesting camera upgrade.' Rumoured updates on the new iPhone 5S include an slow-motion camera with code discovered in iOS 7 suggesting that phones . running the software will be able to record video at a rate of 120 . frames-per-second (FPS) rather than around 30 frames per second. The high-end handset is also predicted to have a sensor that can identify the owner by his or her fingerprints. Code uncovered describes a user touching the Home button with their thumb. A fingerprint then appears on the screen, that changes colour - presumably to signify a match - and the 'recognition is complete'.","According to a TV anchor, the iPhone 5S will include a fast 64-bit A7 processor that would make the phone noticeably faster than the iPhone 5 .

Charge: Oscar Pistorius is alleged to have murdered his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp . A bloodied cricket bat has been found at the home of Oscar Pistorius, local sources say. Police are working on theories that the bat could have been used by Pistorius to attack Reeva Steenkamp before shooting her dead, to break down the door of the bathroom where she was hiding, or even by the late model to defend herself, reported City Press in South Africa. It was also claimed that investigation sources said Miss Steenkamp's skull had been crushed. Meanwhile, Pistorius' best friend has told how he received a phone call moments after Reeva had been shot dead and a distraught Blade Runnder later crying ‘My baba, I’ve killed my baba. God take me away.’ Before the Paralympic medallist called the emergency services he phoned Justin Divaris, 27, at 3.55am to tell him what had happened. ‘I said to him, “What are you talking about?” He then repeated himself – “There has been a terrible accident, I shot Reeva”,’ he told the Sunday People. By the time the businessman had rushed to the athlete's luxury Pretoria home it had already been sealed off by police, but Mr Divaris described seeing the model 'covered in blankets and towels'. Members of both families have spoken out as Pistorius’ father Henke 59, said he had ‘zero doubt’ the fatal shooting was a mistake saying his son had ‘acted on instinct’. The father of the South African model allegedly murdered by Pistorius spoke movingly yesterday of his family’s grief – and said he bore the athlete no animosity. In an emotional interview with The Mail on Sunday, Barry Steenkamp said he was struggling ‘to find some reason why this happened to our lovely daughter’. Pulling out: Pistorius will not compete in the races he was scheduled to . 'Following my visit to Oscar Pistorius this afternoon (Sunday) at the Brooklyn Police Station in Pretoria I would like to issue this short statement. 'The nature of my visit today was two-fold. On a personal level I wanted to offer my support to Oscar, who I have known and worked with for the last seven years and consider a friend and a great professional athlete. 'Secondly, I wanted to briefly discuss racing matters given that his key focus is defending himself against this serious charge. 'I have decided that following these tragic events that we have no option but to cancel all future races that Oscar Pistorius had been contracted to compete in, to allow Oscar to concentrate on the upcoming legal proceedings and to help and support all those involved as they try to come to terms with this very difficult and distressing situation.' It continued: 'Regarding sponsors and partners, I can confirm that at this point in time, all parties are supportive and their contractual commitments are maintained. 'They have said they are happy to let the legal process takes its course before making any change in their position.' Peet Van Zyl, of Pistorius' management company released a statement which said the athlete was pulling out of all scheduled races. Pistorius broke down in tears in court when he was formally charged with Steenkamp’s premeditated murder and Mr Steenkamp said: ‘He must be going through things that we don’t know about. There is no hatred in our hearts.’ Henke Pistorius told the Sunday Telegraph a sportsman's 'instinct' was behind the tragedy, and said the family has pledged to do whatever it takes to clear Oscar's name. Further details of the events at Pistorius’ Pretoria mansion in the early hours of Valentine’s Day have come to light as is was unveiled that he tried to give Miss Steenkamp the kiss of life. After Pistorius carried his girlfriend’s blood-soaked body from the bathroom where she was shot, he tried to revive her, sources close to the investigation told The Sun. ‘There was a great deal of blood and they were convinced Reeva was still alive at that point when Pistorius was giving her the kiss of life, but she died soon after,’ a South African source said.

South African reports have linked the . 24-year-old to Springbok Francois Hougaard - a close friend of Pistorius . - according to the Sunday Mirror.

A 30-year-old man is in the custody of U.S. Immigration officials after being held captive for ten days inside a home in Houston. The man escaped from the house in the southwest area of the city yesterday, wearing nothing but his underwear and shackles. He was discovered after a neighbor called 911 after seeing the man scale a fence. Escaped: A man in shackles and wearing only his underwear told police he escaped from a southwest Houston home where he had been held captive for over a week . The neighbor, who does not want to be named, gave the man clothes and water and then listened as the two waited for police. 'He had chains on his ankles with locks on them, coming up to his hands. He had a little 2x4 that he had pulled out of the wall,' explained the neighbor. The man told the neighbor he had made it from Honduras to McAllen, Texas. He had apparently been lured to Houston on false promises and for the past ten days had been held captive. He had been held prisoner inside a room in the home, where he was taunted with guns. Prisoner: The man, believed to be 30 and from Honduras, said he fled on Wednesday afternoon after being held for about ten days in a house in southwest Houston . His captors, a woman and a man in his late teens, reportedly wanted $3,000 from their hostage’s family. 'He was nervous. He was asking if they were going to send him back. I said, don’t even worry about that,' recalled the neighbor to KHOU. A SWAT team surrounded the home after receiving the 911 call. They stormed the house but the place was empty. 'SWAT did tell us, all of the windows are boarded up with plywood, and that’s a pretty good indication that he was being held against his will, and they didn’t want anybody in the neighborhood to know,' said Houston Police Department spokesman John Cannon. Alert: A neighbor discovered the man escaping through the window of this house and then alerted police . The immigrant said that there were others held against their will in the house. Police are now investigating the claims and looking for the captors . The search is now underway for the two suspects, although officers have not found anyone so far. The pair started renting the home around a month ago. 'I’m surprised because I never hear nothing bad. The neighborhood is quiet. Nothing has ever happened over here,' said neighbor Alba Acosta to KHOU. Police are also considering the possibility that others may have been held captive at the property over the past month.","Man was wearing just shackles and underwear .

Dawn Harkins with her £75,000 question on ITV's Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? Luckily, the mum-of-three won £75,000 and immediately flew 10,000 miles to meet her son. Speaking from Brisbane, she said: 'I never thought I'd see my son again so it's amazing to actually be out here. 'No mum ever forgets their child and I'm so glad I got the chance to meet Glyn and to give him a great big hug. 'I might not have gone home a millionaire - but this trip is worth more than that anyway. I feel like the richest woman in the world.' Dawn Harkins reunited with Glyn, the son she gave up for adoption 45 years ago, after using Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? winnings to visit him in Australia . Dawn was just 15 years old and single when she gave birth to her first baby, a boy she named Keith but who was later renamed Glyn by his adoptive parents. Living in a mother and baby home, Dawn spent only six weeks with her new baby before her parents had him adopted. 'I had no say on it at the time,' said Dawn, who had only reluctantly given her son him away. 'I was just 15 and in 1967 you didn't have an option. 'I ran to find them taking my baby away. I asked if I could give him a kiss and that was the last I saw of him.' Dawn, a retired factory machinist, went on to marry and have two other children, but she never forgot her first born. Her daughter Samantha, 41, began searching for Glyn to help her mum come to terms with her past, and just three months later, last year, she tracked her half-brother down in Brisbane, Australia, by using detective work and adoption forms.

Officials in Wayne County were shocked on Friday when a last-minute bidding war skyrocketed the price of the iconic, but rundown auto plant during the final hours of a tax foreclosure auction . The winner was Jill Van Horn, a family doctor from Ennis, Texas, who bid $6,038,000 for a dilapidated site, after the bidding had started at just $21,000. Van Horn was reported to be teaming up with ‘partners and investors from Detroit, Wall Street and international firms,’ to turn the decrepit site into an ‘economic engine’ that was going to become part of what many hoped would be the city’s great revival. According to Dave Marshall, a spokesman for the investment group, the goal was to produce modular homes at the old Packard factory, ‘(which) will be constructed on the site and shipped all over the world’, reports CBS Detroit. Then on Wednesday, the Wayne County Treasurer’s Office announced that it had been forced to cancel her bid after Van Horn and her investors had failed to come through with the required down payment.

A man suffered severe injuries to his leg after a BASE jumping accident in Moab, Utah earlier this week. The story has gone viral after the injured man, Ammon McNeely, 43, posted a video of himself reacting calmly in the moments after the accident. According to a post on the man’s Facebook page, the accident happened after several others in the group had already jumped. Scroll down for video... Agony: Ammon McNeely, 43, posted a video of him reacting with surreal calm to his mangled leg, although the pain on his face is clear to see . Not a leg to stand on: On a ledge after falling from a BASE jumping parachute mishap, Ammon McNeely photographed his leg, broken below the shin . The Grand County Sheriff’s office said McNeely’s parachute did not fully deploy. As he fell, he hit the rock wall several times before finally coming to a rest on a cliff 600 feet above Kane Creek Boulevard. 'I jumped, probably took a tad longer delay than I should have, I struck the cliff with my left foot and continued rag dolling down the cliff where I finally came to rest on a sloping ledge. I knew I was banged up but to my utter surprise my foot was flipped on its side looking very similar to a nalgene bottle with just a sliver of skin keeping it on. Misjudged: McNeely had just free fallen around 250 feet before his parachute opened the wrong way dashing him into the cliff where he 'rag dolled' another 150 feet . Seconds from disaster: McNeely said he used parachute settings he wasn¿t used to, jumped off a landing site that was brand new to him, and went a tiny bit lower than he should have . My first thought was, I want to wiggle my toes, because this is the last time I will ever feel that sensation' There on a ledge where he came to rest, McNeely pointed the video camera to his stump of a leg, and amidst painful expletives said: 'I think I lost my leg on that one;' then he apologized to his mom, and said 'not cool.' Fortunately for Mr McNeely, one of the men in his group was an EMT. It took around 45 minutes for search and rescue crews to reach him and airlift him to hospital. 'I lost nearly three pints of blood and was very close to leaving this world by the time the helicopter got me to the hospital. On the extremely graphic video posted to YouTube, McNeely remains surprisingly calm throughout the video, casually panning back and forth between his face and his mangled leg. He also repeatedly says he believes he’ll lose his leg. Composed: Viewers have been surprised how calm McNeely remained in the minutes after the accident . In BASE jumping, typically the jumper only has a few seconds to pull the parachute chord to prevent impact. On this occasion McNeely said he used parachute settings he wasn’t used to, jumped off a landing site that was brand new to him, and went a tiny bit lower than he should have. 'If you take one of those equations out of it, I would have been fine, but with all … of those it gave me a problem,' he said. According to his Facebook post, which contains a graphic image of the mangled limb, Mr McNeely said the leg has been saved for now, but he said the possibility of infection means he could still lose the leg. At the hospital, over a period of two days, doctors performed four reconstructive surgeries and got his leg re-attached. 'The doctors said that it was a miracle that they saved the leg,' Mr McNeely makes it clear that he is well aware of the risks of his sport. Risky business: McNeely has had several major accidents while both climbing and BASE jumping . 'BASE jumping is a very hard activity to explain to those who have never experienced the sensation and freedom of leaping off a cliff. Just like rock climbing it's something that you have to be very passionate about to except the risks that come with the amazing feeling you get while following your dreams. I was absolutely prepared to wake up the next morning, minus a foot. I joked about going full pirate mode with a peg leg but knew it could be a reality and was very sad about it. Somehow, they saved it. I'm not completely in the clear at this moment, due to possible infection... but, I survived. So, the question is; Do we stand up and take the risks and have a blast enjoying our passions in life? Or, do we hide in the shadows, being afraid of what might happen if we are so bold to follow our dreams?' McNeely’s expecting another two weeks in the hospital if all goes well, and then a further six to nine months before he can walk again. He’s hoping within a year’s time, he can get back at it, he said, although, 'it’ll never be the same again.' Sorry mom: McNeely's apologizes to his mother for taking the risks that caused the tragic accident. 'That did go too well,' he says in the video . Recovering: Despite the horrific nature of McNeely's injury, doctors were able to reattach the foot and there is a 70 per cent chance he will recover well enough to be able to use it again . McNeely has had several major accidents while both climbing and BASE jumping. One of them occurred on a big wall-climbing route in Zion National Park – one of his favorite places in the world, he said; that injury took months to recover from. He also took an 80-foot fall climbing El Capitan in Yosemite National Park. He shattered his tibia last year in a BASE jumping accident; and he was injured after BASE jumping off a building in Pittsburgh. Aware of the risks of his activities, McNeely said that the benefits greatly outweigh them. 'In those moments everything in life just makes sense,' he said. Most people on this earth are looking for those moments, McNeely said. His activities bring him serenity. They do not bring him much of an adrenaline rush, he said, as most people wrongly assume. Instead of adrenaline, he said he finds a focused meditation. 'It’s something that is very very hard to explain, it’s a very personal thing, it’s hard to put into words why I do it.'","Utah man nearly snapped off his lower leg and foot during botched BASE jump .

Heartbroken Robert Pattinson is still 'not ready' to talk to girlfriend Kristen Stewart, but instead wants to have a 'man to man' chat with Rupert Sanders, the director who she was caught cheating with. The devastated British actor has moved out of the Los Feliz home he shared with Kristen after incriminating photographs showing Kristen and Rupert together were released on Tuesday. 'Rob wants to have a man to man chat with Rupert to find out exactly what happened between him and Kristen,' a source told Radar. Man to man: Robert Pattinson is said to want to talk to director Rupert Sanders following his fling with Kristen Stewart . 'Kristen has already betrayed his trust . by cheating, so he can't be sure that she will tell him exactly what . went on between her and Rupert. Rupert has a wife and a family to save, . so Rob feels like he has nothing left to lose and would be honest with . him.' Sanders, 41, is married to model and actress Liberty Ross and they have two children together. The inside source told the website that Robert, feels 'doubly betrayed' because he 'trusted' Rupert as the director of Kristen's film Snow White and the Huntsman. 'Rob really was blindsided by this and he's going through the typical stages of being cheated on,' the source said. As they were: All was well for Robert and Kristen Stewart as they appeared together at last weekend's Teen Choice Awards . 'He . was hurt and heartbroken, then angry and p****d off, and now he just . wants answers. He feels like he needs to know exactly what happened, how . far it went and how many times, so he can figure out if this is . something he can move past. 'He's not ready to talk with Kristen, it's too painful, so he's going to Rupert.' Even if Robert doesn't want to see or hear from Kristen, the pair will be reunited at the premiere of the final instalment of the Twilight Saga, Breaking Dawn Part 2, in November. Kristen released a statement saying: 'I’m deeply sorry for the hurt and embarrassment I’ve caused. 'This . momentary indiscretion has jeopardised the most important thing in my . life, the person I love and respect the most, Rob. I love him, I love . him, I’m so sorry.' However, Radar's insider said that recent events had Robert 'questioning Kristen's apology.' They said: 'Rob just doesn't know who or . what to believe right now .And he'll do whatever it . takes to find out the truth.' Fling: Kristen, pictured with Snow White and the Huntsman director Rupert Sanders in May, has apologised for her 'momentary indiscretion' with the married 41-year-old . Out: The actor is understood to have pack his bags and left the LA home they share . It was reported yesterday by The UK Mirror that  the 26-year-old British actor ‘couldn’t believe what . he was hearing’ when Kristen told him the fling was just a ‘one off.' The newspaper's source added: ‘Rob . is devastated and deeply hurt. They spoke on the phone and he said . “You’ve completely humiliated me. All the trust has gone.""' It's . unclear exactly when Robert found out about the 22-year-old's affair . with the Snow White and the Huntsman director, who has two children with . British model Liberty Ross. Kristen . and Rupert were photographed in the throes of passion on July 17 but . the images did not surface in the media until two days ago. And . while Kristen and her married director paramour have both issued . grovelling apologies for their exposed affair, Robert has remained . resolutely silent. Keeping her secret: The pair enjoyed a night out in Hollywood on July 19... two days after her tryst with the director . The source told the Mirror that he was ‘furious ‘ Robert who demanded Kristen apologise and she agreed. 'Robert wanted the world to know that he hadn’t done . anything wrong and that she had made a fool of him publicly,' said the insider. Should Robert Pattinson forgive Kristen Stewart for cheating? 'He still can’t fathom why she cheated. Kristen is begging for another chance. Robert is undecided.' The couple were last seen in public at the Teen Choice Awards together on July 22 looking like a decidedly happy couple. But fellow attendees back stage at the ceremony detected some tension between them away from cameras, with a source telling the New York Post: . 'Rob and Kristen were having a long and intense conversation backstage, . and he looked miserable, heartbroken and humiliated. She was pleading.' The actor made his feelings regarding . infidelity clear in April, telling Vanity Fair: 'There's a thing I've . never got: That is, why do people cheat?' He explained that while he 'can . understand the impulse' to cheat, he doesn't comprehend 'how you can . keep two relationships going at the same time for long.' Life imitated art: The couple are in love onscreen too, as Edward and Bella in the Twilight Saga . Taking direction: Kristen and Rupert seen chatting in between takes on the set of Snow White And The Huntsman . Married with children: Ruper Sanders is married to model and actress Liberty Ross and they have two children . 'I'm not the casual-affair kind of . guy,' he said. 'If I choose to be with someone, it's because I really . want it. When I have a relationship, I'm 100 percent into it.' The star has not emerged since details of the dalliance hit the press.

But far from brightening their day, Facebook could be making its users more unhappy. Scientists have found the more time individuals spend on the social networking site, the worse they subsequently feel. Scientists have found the more time individuals spend on the social networking site Facebook, the worse they subsequently feel . More than one in three Britons use Facebook every day, with 24 million logging on to share their latest goings on. ‘On the surface, Facebook provides an invaluable resource for fulfilling the basic human need for social connection,’ said lead researchers Dr Ethan Kross, a psychologist at the University of Michigan. ‘But rather than enhance well-being, we found that Facebook use predicts the opposite result - it undermines it.’ Research carried out earlier this year at the University of Chester suggested Facebook friends are no substitute for the real thing. It found people are happier and laugh 50 per cent more when talking face-to-face with friends or via webcam than when they use social networking sites. And the current study backed these findings, with participants who had direct interactions with other people feeling better over time. In contrast, the more individuals used Facebook during the period, the greater the reduction in their life satisfaction levels. ‘This is a result of critical importance because it goes to the very heart of the influence that social networks may have on people’s lives,’ said co-author John Jonides, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Michigan. The research, published in the journal Public Library of Science ONE, looked at the browsing habits of 82 young adults, all of whom had smartphones and Facebook accounts. More than one in three Britons use Facebook every day, with 24 million logging on to share their latest goings on . As well as monitoring their use of social media, the participants all took part in an online survey five times a day, which measured their emotional well-being. Questions included ‘How do you feel right now?’ and ‘How much have you used Facebook since the last time we asked?’. They also asked the volunteers to rate their level of life satisfaction at the start and the end of the two-week study. Researcher discovered their happiness levels declined the more they used Facebook. The reason for the drop in life satisfaction remains unclear, as participants were not more likely to use the social network when unhappy. ‘It was not the case that Facebook use served as a proxy for feeling bad or lonely,’ Dr Kross said.Further research will now be carried out to understand why time spent on social media can lower moods. ‘This is the advantage of studying Facebook use and well-being as dynamic processes that unfold over time,’ said researcher Philippe Verduyn, from the University of Leuven in Belgium. ‘It allows us to draw inferences about the likely causal sequence of Facebook use and well-being.’ In April, a study by the University of Oxford found couples who communicate using Facebook could be putting a strain on their relationship. Psychologists found husbands and wives who kept in touch using social media had less satisfying marriages. Dr Bernie Hogan, from Oxford Internet Institute, suggested marital disharmony could be triggered by the stress and time pressure of constantly maintaining so many different threads of communication.","Study looked at browsing habits of .

The most dangerous killer highways in Britain are revealed today in a chilling new accident road-map of Britain. The study, which colour-codes roads according to their level of risk, also reveals that drivers are now seven times more likely to crash on an A-road than a motorway. That risk has risen significantly from a six-fold gap just four years earlier. Blackspots: The map highlights the most dangerous places to drive in the country . Travel on a single-carriageway is also three times riskier than on a dual carriageway, according to the study. The report and ‘Risk Map’ reveal that the most dangerous stretch of road in Britain is seven miles of single-carriageway A537 from Macclesfield to Buxton, which has seen 44 fatal and serious crashes between 2007 and 2011. It is followed by nine miles of the A5012 between the A515 (Pikehall) and the A6 in the East Midlands where four-year fatalities and serious injuries have increased from 18 to 25. Third place in the A-road accident league table is 13 miles of the A682 near junction 13 of the M65 motorway near Nelson in Yorkshire. Twenty-four people were killed or seriously injured there in each four-year period. The dangers for drivers on A-roads away from urban areas have been highlighted in a Road Safety Foundation survey which gives a risk rating to every road in the country. The detailed survey looked at 28,000 miles of British motorways and A-roads outside major urban areas to create a colour-coded ‘Risk Map’ covering every major highway in Britain. Danger zone: The A537 and A5012, shown on the map in black, are the two most dangerous stretches of road in Britain . The most dangerous high-risk roads are black, medium high risk roads are red, down to the safest, low-risk roads in green. The report says although these major roads make up just 11 per cent of the road network they carry 56 per cent of all traffic. It shows that vehicles running off the road account for nearly a third  (30 per cent) of all deaths on these roads while crashes at junctions are the most common accidents leading to serious injury. The report reveals that for the period 2007-11 the risk to road users was seven times greater on single carriageway A-roads than motorways. In the 2002-2006 period this figure was six-fold. And while almost one in ten (9 per cent of motorways)  are rated in the ‘low risk’ category, almost all (97 per cent)  of single carriageway A-roads are not.By region, the highest risk of death and serious injury on motorways and A-roads is in the East Midlands, and the lowest in the West Midlands and the poll revealed. The most improved region is the East of England, with a 30 per cent fall in risk. More than one in five (21 per cent) of fatal crashes and serious crashes on non-urban A-roads involve pedestrians or cyclists, with one in ten being head-on collisions, and one in 12 (8 per cent) shunts. Risky: The A537 was ranked the most dangerous road in Britain . The single-lane road is only seven miles long, but sees an average of more than 10 fatal or serious accidents a year. Some 1,754 people were killed on Britain’s roads in 2012. But on average, 4 people are killed or seriously injured on each mile of motorway and A roads outside major urban areas each decade. Motorcyclists make up just 1per cent of traffic but one in five (21per cent) of fatal and serious crashes on Britain’s motorways and A roads. The report shows 'the dominance of crashes at junctions leading to serious trauma and of death from running off the road.’ But it also highlights improvements which could reduce the carnage including removing roadside hazards such as trees, rigid poles or lighting columns and introducing interactive warning signs, anti-skid surfacing and road studs. At junctions, crash risks could be reduced by speed limits better suited to the conditions, improved road layout and  signing, and by resurfacing roads with high-friction treatments to reduce skidding. Risk: The study found that A-road were more dangerous than motorways, and single carriageways more deadly than dual carriageways . The report notes how there has been a ‘remarkable’ 70 per cent  drop in serious crashes –  saving 250 fatal and serious injury crashes– on the ten most improved  roads across Britain. The most improved road is a seven-mile stretch of the A4128 at High Wycombe, where changes to speed limits, warning signs, and other improvements saw the number of deaths and serious injuries over a four year period drop from 31 to just four - a drop of 87 per cent. Second-most improved was a six-mile section of the M6 motorway at junction 44 (Carlisle) where deaths and serious injuries over four years dropped from 24 to 5 – or 79 per cent. The roads were assessed using measures developed by the European Road Assessment Programme (EuroRAP), whose chairman  John Dawson said: ’The British public knows the safety rating of the cars they’re buying but not their roads. 'Our EuroRAP risk maps give an objective view of where people are being killed or seriously injured on a road network and where their crash risk is greatest.’ The ‘Risk Map’ uses the most up-to-date crash and traffic data from the national road injury and accidents database provided by the Department for Transport. It includes all crashes resulting in fatal or serious injuries during the data periods 2002-2006 and 2007-2011 inclusive. 1,754 people were killed on Britain’s roads in 2012. 11,457 were killed on British roads in the 5 year survey period 2007-2011, compared with 16,533 in the previous 5 years - a drop of 31 per cent. The 28,0000-mile network of motorways and A roads outside major urban areas analysed in this report represents just 11 per cent of Britain’s road length - but carries 56 per cent of traffic  and more than half (51 per cent) of all deaths. Motorways and dual carriageways have seen the greatest improvement with a 24 per cent reduction in the survey. The improvement for single carriageways is 18per cent. On average, four people are killed or seriously injured on each mile of motorway and A-roads outside major urban areas each decade.In the 2007-2011 data period, single carriageway A-roads are seven times more risky than motorways. In the 2002-2006 period this figure was six. Travel on single carriageways is three times more risky than dual carriageways. 62 per cent of fatal and serious crashes occur on single carriageway A-roads, 12 per cent on duals, 15 per cent on mixed single/dual and 11 per cent on motorways. The most common crashes on motorways and A-roads leading to death are run-offs (30 per cent). The most common crashes leading to either death or serious injury occur at junctions (36 per cent). 21 per cent of fatal and serious crashes involved pedestrians or cyclists; 10 per cent were head-ons  and 8 per cent shunts. 22 per cent of fatal crashes involved pedestrians or cyclists; 19 per cent were head-ons and 6 per cent shunts. 99 per cent of motorways are rated in the ‘low risk’ category; 97 per cent of single carriageways are not. The British economy loses more than 2 per cent of GDP in road crashes. British road users pay 1 per cent of GDP on motor insurance. In the last five years, Britain suffered serious injury costs of £1.9 billion on motorways, £8.4 billion on primary A-roads and £5.9billion on non-primary A-roads. Motorways account for 36 per cent of travel on the network analysed, 18 per cent on duals and 32 per cent on singles. Motorcyclists make up just 1 per cent of traffic but 21 per cent of fatal and serious crashes on Britain’s motorways and A-roads.

The teenager who took the photo said the boy on the subway, who was traveling alone, looked like pictures of Avonte that have been plastered across New York since he left his Long Island City school. When he asked the boy if he was Avonte, the subway passenger just stared ahead - a reaction common in those with autism. The teenager took the boy's photo but didn't report the sighting to authorities because he wasn't supposed to be on the train, according to Newsday. Officials found out about the sighting after the picture was posted on to Facebook. When . Avonte went missing he was wearing a gray striped shirt, black jeans . and black sneakers.

According to Miss Freyre she worked hard to pay for the bike with the intention that it would be her only mode of transport because she could not afford to travel everyday on the trains. So the student, who attends DePaul University in Chicago, Illinois, didn't hold back with her use of vocabulary in her letter to the thief. The potty-worded tirade quickly went viral but despite being laced with swear words it led to a good Samaritan coming forward and buying the cash-strapped student a new pair of wheels.

A mother-of-four claimed £100,000 in benefits saying she was unable to work because she is allergic to shoes. Tracy Kenny, 45, a former baker, says she had to give up working 24 years ago after developing a skin condition that made it impossible for her to wear shoes. She said severe dermatitis caused by all her footwear left her unable to hold down a job. But now inspectors at the Department for Work and Pensions have ruled she is fit for work and told her it will stop her £440 per month employment support benefits. Disability benefits: Tracy Kenny, 45, has been unable to work because she has contact dermatitis and is unable to wear shoes . Mrs Kenny, who lost her appeal against the decision, said it was impossible for her to work as she suffers from an allergy to rubber, glue, nickel and metal that brings her out in blisters. She says she is so allergic to shoes  she has to wander around barefoot,  even during winter, and can only  leave her house in Eccles, Salford, on a mobility scooter. She said: ‘I don’t know how these  people expect me to go to work or go to job interviews with no shoes on – because that is what I would have to do. ‘I can only wear shoes for ten or 15  minutes, before my feet blister and split. It stops me from doing everything. ‘I’m allergic to any chemicals in shoes. The doctors even organised for a pair of clogs to be made in Switzerland for me. ‘It took two years. They even cut  down a tree especially and made me a shoe with no dyes in. Yet they still irritate me. ‘Socks draw the glue in and slippers don’t help. It’s so unfair and stressful – I’m genuinely ill.’ Medication: Tracy Kenny is largely housebound and has to take around 20 tablets as well as applying ointments and creams . Shoe allergy: Tracy had these shoes specially-made in Switzerland - but she is allergic to them too . Feet up: Tracy Kenny wears slippers to get round her house in Salford, Greater Manchester, but said she is unable to get out to work . Rash: Tracy Kenny's feet after she suffered an allergic reaction to footwear. She has had the condition for more than 20 years . Tracy Kenny suffers from contact dermatitis which is a type of eczema which makes her skin red, scaly and painful. She says her condition flares up every time she comes into contact with rubber, glue, nickel and metal. It most commonly affects the hands, but can affect other parts of the body. One in five women will suffer from a mild form of contact dermatitis and some point in their lifetime. The condition is usually treated with moisturisers - and 40 per cent of sufferers find out the condition goes away altogether. Her life on benefits ended after she took a medical test and faced  a tribunal from the DWP on October 2. Now she has been declared fit to work, though she will still be allowed to claim £200 a month in disability living allowance. She said: ‘They’re questioning my doctor’s ability as a doctor. She sees me and knows me more than a ten-minute assessment does.’ Mrs Kenny, who lives with scaffolder husband Steve, 49, and also has diabetes, said: ‘It started when I contracted dermatitis when I was 18 or 19. 'I was working at a baker’s and suddenly my hands started coming up blistering. ‘I was referred to the skin hospital where I was told it was the detergents I was using in the baker’s. I carried on working but it got worse and started to affect my face.’ She gave up the job and began working in a shop but found she was allergic to dust. She then changed jobs again and worked in a warehouse packing leaflets in magazines but found that played havoc with her allergies as well. Disabled: Tracy Kenny has a mobility scooter to use on the rare occasions that she is able to venture out of her home in Salford - and often does so barefooted . Proud mother: Tracy's son Joshua is returning from Afghanistan after completing a tour of duty. She has four children, the youngest of whom is 18 . Skin condition: Tracy, who wears white gloves to stop her hands coming into contact with things she is allergic to, holds a letter which explains her disability benefits are being stopped . Mrs Kenny said: ‘I worked up until I was 21. Since then I haven’t worked basically because things just got worse and worse. ‘I had some more tests done. I’m allergic to nickel, I’m told not to touch keys, not to touch coins, not to use knives and forks.’ She says her contact dermatitis causes a type of eczema leaving her skin red, itchy and scaly. She shares her home with her husband and their children Jessica, 21, Aimee-lea, 19, and Lauren, 18. Son Josh, 22, was arriving back from Army duty in Afghanistan yesterday. They also have a dog Alfie and cat Bailey. A spokesman for the DWP said decisions to remove benefits are only taken after careful assessment and consideration of medical evidence. Margaret Cox, of the National Eczema Society, said: ‘People don’t understand just how awfully painful a severe eczema can be.’ Long term condition: Tracy in 1999 with her husband Steven.

Tragedy: Izzy Dix, 14, was found hanged by her mother, who today released a poem written by her daughter before she died . The words are harrowing and haunting. For the mother of the tormented teenager who wrote them, they must have been unbearable to read. The poem printed here was written by 14-year-old Izzy Dix, who killed herself in September after suffering months of cruel taunts from fellow school pupils and internet trolls. Yesterday her grieving mother Gabbi released the work to the public in the hope that her daughter’s words might make other potential bullies think twice about their behaviour and perhaps prevent further tragedy. Mrs Dix, who lives in Brixham, Devon, said her daughter wrote the piece after attending a local music festival in July and returning home in floods of tears. Called I Give Up, it reads: ‘They begin to tell me that nobody wants me there. They tell me to leave and that I am not wanted. ‘I look down and walk, my eyes drowning in a sea of emotion. Another piece of me chiselled away by their cruel remarks and perceptions. I give up.’ The poem was read out at the schoolgirl’s funeral where it reduced many mourners to tears. Mrs Dix said she decided to publish it to help people understand the pain and suffering caused by bullying and abuse on social media sites. She said: ‘I know this may be uncomfortable for people but this is what was going on in my daughter’s life before she died. In her own words, this is how she was feeling.’ She added: ‘I want young people all around the world to think about the potential impact of their behaviour before they act. ‘We all need to be motivated by love and kindness, not nastiness and hate.’ Mrs Dix has also called for the closure of the controversial website Ask.fm, where Izzy was abused by anonymous cyber bullies. The Latvian-based site, which has been linked to several teenage suicides, allows unidentified users to post comments and questions to a person’s profile. Bereft: Izzy's mother Gabbi kisses her child in this moving photograph, and she says although the poem may be uncomfortable, it is important that people read Izzy's thoughts . Sympathies: Floral tributes were left outside Izzy Dix's home in Brixham, Devon after her death last month . Izzy’s father Eugene Conway has helped launch an online petition addressed to David Cameron, who has previously described Ask.fm as ‘vile’. It calls on the Government to ban the site, and so far has attracted more than 8,000 signatures. The petition states: ‘On the night of Tuesday 17th September 2013, 14-year-old Devon schoolgirl Izzy Dix tragically took her own life. Her death has been linked to bullying, both at school and online. ‘A lot of the bullying Izzy was troubled over occurred on social media site Ask.fm. We want it closed down. Heartbreak: Schoolgirl Izzy Dix, 14, with her mother Gabbi . ‘It gives cyber bullies a platform, . allowing them to post hurtful comments and remain anonymous.’ Mr Conway . said: ‘I know she is at least the tenth teenager to have taken her life . because of it. ‘It is time we ramped up the pressure on the people who run this site to get it taken down.’ Izzy’s . friend Tia Budd said: ‘It’s horrible and should be closed.’ She added: . ‘We have deleted our accounts, but there are still people taking the . hate and it doesn’t need to happen.’ Police have said they are not treating the death as suspicious.

A teenager has been found guilty of stealing chef Guy Fieri's Lamborghini from a San Francisco dealership. The Marin County panel found Max Wade, 19, guilty of commercial burglary and auto theft of the $200,000 convertible. The court heard how Wade rappelled into British Motors in 2011 and stole the car while it was in the dealership for repairs. Wade was also found guilty of attempted murder and firing a gun into an occupied vehicle in an unrelated drive-by shooting of a man who was dating a girl Wade desired. The man wasn't injured. Max Wade, right, is accused of stealing celebrity chef Guy Fieri's car back in March 2011 . The celebrity chef¿s bright-yellow Lamborghini was worth $800,000 and was missing for over 18 months . Marin County prosecutor Yvette . Martinez said Wade had stolen the yellow Lamborghini to impress the girl . and was willing to kill to get her attention. Wade pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. He now faces up to 30 years in prison. Detectives . testified during the trial that they found the gun used in the . shooting, two assault weapons and shotgun shells, as well as climbing . gear. Fieri, a star of Food . Network, testified during the trial that he had never met Wade and never . gave him permission to drive his car. The . teen made news again last year after at least two people tried to break . into Marin County's juvenile hall with sledgehammers in an unsuccessful . attempt to free him. Authorities . took extra measures to ensure security in the courtroom during the . trial, keeping Wade tethered to a chair bolted to the floor. Max Wade, left, as he looked in his police mugshot at the time  and Eva Dedier, right, who he is charged with attempting to murder after she spurned his advances . Fieri . appeared in court as a witness during the case, testifying for just a . few minutes to confirm that he did not know the teen nor did he give him . permission to take the luxury car out of the dealership. Prosecutors allege that Wade stole the car in a ‘Mission Impossible’-style heist to impress the girl, Eva Dedier, who is now 19. Then in April 2012 he attempted to kill Dedier and her former boyfriend, Landon Wahlstrom, as they sat in Wahlstrom’s truck. That . investigation led authorities to Wade's storage container in Richmond, . where they found the Food Network star's stolen yellow Lamborghini. Fieri told reporters outside of court that he is relieved the ordeal is nearly over. ‘It's been a really crazy story,’ he said. During the 18 month period that the car, Fieri said he constantly received calls from people who had spotted the vehicle being driven around the Bay Area . He had been in Chicago filming his . show ‘Dives, Diners and Drive-ins’ for the Food Network when he heard . the car had been stolen. ‘I thought it was a bad joke,’ Fieri told NBC Bay Area. During the 18 month period that the car, the chef said he constantly received calls from people who had spotted the vehicle.

A nursing home resident has been arrested for murder after he allegedly bludgeoned his elderly roommate to death with part of a wheelchair on Wednesday. Thomas Yarnavick was arrested over the attack on his 71-year-old roommate at a New York nursing home. Police said an ongoing argument over a curtain that separated the men's beds escalated into the brutal attack. Murder: A resident at the Beacon nursing home is facing charges of killing his 71-year-old roommate . 'It's as if you live in a small, . tight-knit town, and you wake up to incredibly tragic news. This is like . a small town,' Aaron Lichtman, a spokesman for the Beacon Rehabilitation and Nursing Center in the Rockaways, said. Yarnavick, 66, had been roommates with his unnamed victim since September and staff said there had been no warning signs or obvious problems between them. Mr Lichtman said staff at the nursing home, which was badly damaged during Superstorm Sandy last year, had never witnessed such violence. The attack happened at about 1.30am. An employee who discovered the distressing scene called police. The 71-year-old victim had serious head injuries and was taken to hospital, where he was pronounced dead. It is not yet known if the wheelchair used in the attack belonged to Yarnavick or his victim. Yarnavick, who is facing murder and weapons charges, was taken into custody and is awaiting arraignment in Queens. Psychologists and grief counselors have been made available to other residents in the home, which can house up to 120 people. 'There is a lot of work to do to help these residents. We are all grieving, the employees, too,' Mr Lichtman said. The nursing home, which is on the Rockaways broadwalk, was badly affected by Sandy last year. Requests for the home to be evacuated were denied, meaning residents remained in the building as seawater crashed through the first floor. They lived in the soaked, sand-filled building for several days afterwards, with the lights running on emergency generators, until the state gave a mandatory evacuation order as a snowstorm approached.","Thomas Yarnavick faces murder and weapons charges .

An airport passenger who decided to track his car after leaving it with a 'secure parking area' discovered it had actually spent a week in a muddy field - surrounded by scores of other vehicles . The site did not have perimeter fencing, CCTV or lights and was only discovered after the passenger used his car¿s tracker to find out where it had been during his week-long break . He booked online through an agency that uses a number of car parks around the airport. His car was picked up and dropped off at the airport after he says he was told it would be kept in a secure area. He said: 'I was horrified when it showed where my car had been kept while I was on holiday. 'My car had been stored in a field where there is no security fence, CCTV or any kind of lighting and also this is clearly visible from the main road. 'I thought I was going to get a security perimeter fence, CCTV and also electric gates and on-site security – yet having visited the site myself I found none of this to be evident.' It is not clear which firms are parking cars at the site. The cars were parked on land about four miles from Manchester airport in Styal, near Wilmslow. It is not clear which agency runs the site . An airport spokesman said: 'The security of our passengers and their belongings is of utmost importance to us at Manchester Airport, which is why we always recommend booking one of our eight secure car parks.' Extra parking spaces could soon be built at the airport to ease congestion – and cater for growing passenger numbers. Airport chiefs have applied to build a 9,000-space car park on fields in Wythenshawe. The controversial plan has sparked fury from residents who say it will destroy dwindling greenbelt land – and prompt passengers to park on their roads to save money before boarding a shuttle bus.

The 24-hour car park is earmarked for the Styal Road, Ringway Road and Shadowmoss Road area which is to the north-east of the site. It is part of the airport’s overall development of the site, which will include the removal of a 3,000-space car park to make way for Airport City.

Four young children who could only communicate in grunts when they were discovered living in a feces-ridden home had been known to child welfare for more than a year, it has emerged. Caseworkers and police officers had even visited the home in Denver, Colorado but concluded the boys - who had to sleep on urine-soaked beds with no sheets - were 'fine', police reports show. Records also reveal that there were previous child abuse convictions against the parents, while a lawyer who works opposite the apartment block said his complaints to child services were ignored. The boys, aged two, four, five and six, were found living in horrendous conditions with their father, Wayne Sperling, 66, on September 29. Lashing out: Lorinda Bailey shouts at reporters while walking from the Denver Justice Center on the first day of her hearing on Tuesday. Her four malnourished sons were found living in a feces-covered home . The children were not toilet trained, could only communicate using 'infant-like noises' and were so badly neglected it was impossible to tell which was the oldest, a police report noted. Police checked on the home after the children's mother, Lorinda Bailey, sparked concern during a trip to the doctors and found two inches of cat . feces under the bunk bed where the boys had slept. Now it has emerged that the family was known to child welfare, but authorities would not comment on how the case slipped through the cracks for so long, the Denver Post reported. Bailey had previously lost her parental rights to three older children four years ago, the Post said. In April 2012, police interviewed the parents in the presence of a Denver County child welfare caseworker after reports that three of the children, who were partially clothed or naked, were hanging out an 8-foot high window above a spiked fence. Charged: The father of the children, Wayne . Sperling, 66, is also charged with child abuse after the children were . found living at his filthy home. Bailey, 35, lived in a different part of the block but saw them daily . Hearing: Bailey, who was known to child welfare, enters court at the Denver Justice Center on Tuesday . Accused: Her sons could not speak and were only wearing diapers when they were found in the filthy home . The police report simply concluded: 'The children did not talk at any point but appeared fine.' The . call came after David Littman, a family law attorney working across the . street from the apartment, called police to report his fears. But . he added that he also called child protective services last summer as . he saw the boys were often unclothed and unsupervised and were throwing . toys from their window, he told the Denver Post. He said he never received a call about what had become of his complaint. Two further calls in 2012 and 2013 to a child abuse hotline were not investigated, sources told 7News. Denver . County Department of Human Services officials said they could not . discuss the case because of privacy laws and the state child welfare . division opened a review of the incident. Scene: A man walks past the residence of Sperling, where the four boys were found in deplorable conditions. Police records show that officers had previously responded to complaints . Investigators were eventually called . in last month after Bailey, 35, took the youngest child to St Joseph's . Children's Hospital for treatment to a cut to his forehead. Although Ms Bailey lived in another part of the apartment block, she claimed to have seen her boys almost every day. The . child, who has not been named, was said by the emergency room doctor to . have been unable to speak, was unwashed, and smelled of cigarette . smoke. Denver . Police were called and officer N Rocco-McKeel attended the hospital to . investigate. When he arrived he spoke to the doctor and Denver Human . Services case worker, Jill Perry. Ms . Perry told him there were three other boys in the family's home in 18th . Avenue and asked officer Rocco-McKeel to accompany her on a welfare . check, according to the affidavit. Questions: Family attorney David Littman, pictured in his law office opposite the home in Denver, said he called child welfare about concerns he had about the children - but that calls were ignored . When they arrived, officer Rocco-McKeel reported a strong smell of a decomposing animal coming from inside. He said the 'smell became unbearable' as they entered the apartment. Although he could not locate the source, he said it seemed to be coming from a back room that was so full of flies 'they were covering every surface'. Officer Rocco-Mckeel also saw five cats running around and said there was faeces on the floor throughout the apartment. The children could only communicate with each other using 'infant-like noises', the report noted. He claimed all the children seemed to be about the same size, and he could not tell the age or developmental differences between the three oldest children. Two of the youngsters were wearing nothing but nappies. Bailey denied that her children had developmental problems and claimed they spoke to her without any difficulty. She also denied that the apartment was was unsafe or dirty. Investigation: Police were alerted when the youngest child was taken for treatment to St Joseph's Hospital . None of the children attend school or daycare, and Sperling said that he was 'applying to home school' the six-year-old child. The children were placed in protective custody and all four were given medical examinations. When investigators returned to the home on September 30, they noticed attempts had been made to clean up, but described the smell as 'was still overwhelming'. Sperling and Bailey have been charged with four counts of felony child abuse. Bailey, who is free on bond, appeared in court Tuesday while Sperling remains in custody.

Eddy said: 'Over the years, fries have . become known world wide and enjoyed by adults and children in . practically all countries and we so can be proud that they actually . originate from Belgium. 'This is why it is not only normal, but absolutely necessary that the first potato fry museum should be opened in Belgium.' Miss Belgian Beauty Nele Setners shows her support for the museum by appearing on one of its flyers . Historic: The Frietmuseum is housed in the oldest building in Bruges . Potatoes, chips and the various condiments which can be enjoyed with them including Belgian favourite mayonnaise are all celebrated in the quirky museum, which is spread over two floors. All of the rooms are painted a nice chip-coloured yellow and the museum shows off a range of exhibits including ancient potato cutters and a video which shows the process of turning a potato into a chip.

Belgians lay claim to the humble chip, though there is an ongoing dispute between the nation and France over its origin. Belgian journalist Jo Gerard claims that the method of deep frying potatoes was used in the Spanish Netherlands (modern belgium) before 1860, citing a 1781 family manuscript. Gerard has never produced the manuscript. Regardless of which country invented chips, it is likely that the potato did not arrive in the area until around 1735. The food is often attributed to the French - they are called French Fries after all - with Americans citing a notation from Thomas Jefferson between 1801 and 1809 which refers to Pommes de terre frites a cru, en petites tranches (potatoes deep-fried while raw, in small cuttings). From 1813 onwards, recipes for what could be described as French fries began appearing in American cookbooks. Some also believe that the chip may have originated in Spain - the first European country that the potato appeared in via the New World colonies.","Eddy Van Belle and son Cidric pay homage to the chip in the Belgian capital .

For the piece, the Duchess of . Cambridge's sister posed for various photos around the festival and even . tried her luck at Bavarian nail-hammering game Nagelbock.

In other images, which can be viewed on the Telegraph website, Pippa posed next to a stall adored with gingerbread delights and then another laden with schnapps. Pippa embarked on various adventures for her piece, including skiing, hiking, dancing and gorging on traditional delicacies. The piece begins with the columnist describing her 'burning thighs' as she descends the notorious Hahnenkamm ski course before complaining about her easyJet bag weight limit not allowing room for her walking boots. Eventually, Pippa arrives at the festival and remarks: 'There is only one way to enjoy this and that’s to enter fully into the fun. 'I was easily lured by the prospect of dancing in a dirndl, sampling every wurst imaginable, sniffing suspiciously and then knocking back the flavoured schnapps at various stalls, while using the one word of German I felt comfortable with (bitte) over and over.' Pippa goes on to describe sampling another delicacy - the pretzel - but says she only managed to eat half on it because of the tight-fitting drindl . She added that she attempted a Bavarian jig and a bit of shoe-slapping, but her dancing skills were less than to be desired - especially in front of the 'lederhosen-clad boys'. Happy couple: Pippa Middleton and boyfriend Nico Jackson arrive at Edinburgh Airport today . Pippa, who is also a columnist for Vanity Fair, obviously enjoyed her visit, promising at the end of her piece that she would 'need to find an excuse to return'. Last week, Pippa wrote about flower arranging for her lifestyle column in the Telegraph, adding that she loves to join the 'savvy church flower arrangers and DIY brides' at Covent Garden Flower Market in London.

Gary Lineker has hit out at the ‘utterly depressing’ culture of pushy parents trying to turn their children into footballing superstars. He said the behaviour of competitive mothers and fathers  puts pressure on the children and stops them enjoying themselves – and hinders their development  as players. The Match of the Day presenter said they should just ‘shut the f*** up’ while watching their youngsters. Gary Lineker, pictured here with his first wife, Michelle Cockayne, and their children Harry, George and Tobias, has hit out at the 'utterly depressing' culture of pushy parents . Lineker, 52, has previously told how he has been moved to speak to other fathers on the touchline at football matches to try to get them to calm down. Writing in the New Statesman, the former England player, who scored 48 goals in 80 international games, was bemoaning the standard of football at youth level. He said: ‘It’s obvious why we have a long-ball culture: the big lads who can kick it furthest are the ones that stand out. What chance for the diminutive yet gifted midfielder? No chance of him developing his tiki-taka football. ‘The only way to get to the other end of the pitch is to belt it and then belt it again.’ And he said that some of the blame for this mentality lay with the parents who don’t allow their children time to develop as players. Lineker – who was asked to contribute to the magazine by guest editor comedian Russell Brand – wrote: ‘This madness is only exacerbated by the maniacal parents on the touchline spouting nonsense at their children. ‘The competitive nature of most mums and dads is astounding. The fear they instil in our promising but sensitive Johnny is utterly depressing. We need a parental cultural revolution. If we could just get them to shut the f*** up and let their children enjoy themselves, you would be staggered at the difference it would make.’ Lineker scored 48 goals in 80 international games during his England career . Lineker has previously spoken of how he was left shocked at the behaviour of fellow parents he encountered on the sidelines when he was a spectator at amateur games played by his children George, 21, Harry, 19, Tobias, 16, and Angus, 13, all from his first marriage to Michelle Cockayne. He said the problem of pushy and aggressive parents isn’t so much of an issue in other countries such as Holland, where parents are much more relaxed with their children. In a previous piece he wrote: ‘I remember the applause from watching parents when something good happened on the pitch – and patient silence if a pass went astray.’ But in England, he says he has witnessed mothers and fathers swearing at the referee, abusing the manager and shouting at their own children – one time even seeing a father take his own son off the pitch because he thought he was playing poorly. Lineker, who was never booked or sent off in his career, admitted he has even confronted other parents in a bid to get them to calm down. Lineker made the comments in the New Statesman magazine, which was guest-edited by Russell Brand . He wrote previously: ‘It’s got so bad at times that I’ve felt it necessary to have a quiet word with some of them to tone it down, politely suggesting that their “commitment” isn’t actually helping their own sons relax and enjoy playing the game.’ He added: ‘There is a breed of parent I’ve seen who hurl ridiculous abuse at the officials or even the young player they are meant to be supporting. ‘It is as if they are living their own dreams through their kids. They put far too much pressure on them and the results can be shocking.’","Former England footballer hits out at 'utterly depressing' culture .

Fire tore through a family home gutting a teenager's bedroom after she FORGOT to unplug her hair straighteners... a day after her angry parents berated her for leaving them on. Ellie Palin said she is consumed by guilt after leaving the straighteners on in her bedroom as she got ready to go out with friends on Monday night. The hot wand sparked a blaze, which ravaged Ellie's bedroom, consuming a wardrobe and destroying the room. The 14-year-old's older brother Callum raised the alarm after smelling smoke and spotting the flames when he went in search of a snack. The family have been forced to move in with relatives while their bungalow in Knypersely, near Biddulph in Staffordshire is repaired. Ellie said: 'I had turned the straighteners off but not unplugged them. 'I thought my mum was joking when she told me what happened. It was quite a shock. 'I . feel really guilty about it because it was my fault and it's affected . the rest of the house. I'm going to be really paranoid about my . straighteners now.' Furious mother Marianne, 44, said her daughter had been repeatedly warned at the weekend about leaving the straighteners on. The teaching support assistant said she arrived home to find her son standing in the drive, and opened the door to a wall of thick black smoke. 'My husband shouted at her on Sunday about leaving them on,' said Mrs Palin. 'She feels very guilty about it. It has been a very harsh lesson for her. My son was the only one in the house at the time. Scorched: The burnt remains of the 14-year-old's room at the family home in Knypersely.

A paroled rapist is on the loose in Southern California and has been harassing the family of his 80-year-old victim with dozens of threatening and obscene phone calls. Authorities said Wednesday that Dennis Michael McKenzie, 58, is missing after he cut off his GPS locator and disappeared from a Long Beach halfway house. Police have asked for the public's help as they search for McKenzie, who they claim is a threat to his elderly victim and to the wider public. It wasn't immediately known how long McKenzie has been on the lam, but authorities took a photo of him last month after he was picked up on a parole violation and put in jail for five days, said San Bernardino County sheriff's spokeswoman Jodi Miller. Over the past month McKenzie has made more than 50 phone calls from his Long Beach apartment to the victim's family in the San Bernardino Mountains. They wouldn't elaborate on the threats, but the push to catch McKenzie has been amplified because of the calls. 'He's a threat not only to the victim, but he's a threat, in general, to public safety,' Miller said. A message seeking comment from the California Department of Corrections was not immediately returned Wednesday. McKenzie was convicted of raping an 80-year-old woman and sentenced to seven years in prison in 2004. Phone calls: Over the past month McKenzie has made more than 50 phone calls from his Long Beach apartment in the 2200 block of West Wardlow Road, pictured, to the victim's family in the San Bernardino Mountains . The sexual assault occurred during a burglary, according to court documents. Authorities don't believe McKenzie has relatives in Southern California, but he does have a history of frequenting the Lake Arrowhead area and Palm Springs. He has been added to the list of the Mountain's Most Wanted Fugitives by the Twin Peaks Sheriff's Department. He is described as a white male, 5-feet 11-inches tall, brown hair and blue eyes.

"By . Ap . PUBLISHED: . 22:20 EST, 23 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 00:12 EST, 24 October 2013 . In a moment of quiet reflection, Ed Ayers sat in front a wall etched with the names of 241 Americans who were slaughtered 30 years ago when a suicide bomber drove a truck into a four-story military barracks in Beirut. He wept as he remembered his own peacekeeping service before his unit was replaced by the troops who were attacked. 'It's a shame,' said Ayers, who wished the U.S. involvement in Lebanon's civil war had been handled differently. 'I don't think we're the world's police. We should determine what our own values are.' Marine Corps Commandant Gen. James Amos and hundreds of others gathered Wednesday at the memorial bordering Camp Lejeune. A granite wall with the words 'They Came in Peace' honors the bombing victims of Oct. 23, 1983, which was the deadliest terrorist attack on Americans before Sept. 11, 2001. Somber anniversary: hundreds showed up to pay tribute at the Beirut Memorial for the 30th anniversary of the bombing . Destruction: The barracks that were destroyed was a four-story building packed with military personnel . Casualties: In addition to the 241 Americans killed, 88 French soldiers also lost their lives . Amos said the attack helped define the start of America's war against terrorists. 'The nation was not expecting this. There was a new kind of warfare - the threat of radical extremists being able to target military and civilian personnel with weapons of mass destruction for political, religious and personal gains,' he said. 'We will never forgive nor will we ever forget.' But some worried the 1983 attack and a truck-bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut six months earlier had been forgotten. Michelle Lucas was 15 when her brother, Lance Cpl. Richard Morrow, died in the barracks bombing. She wished more people knew about the attack. 'I don't know why it's not taught in schools,' the Philadelphia-area woman said, her eyes red from crying. 'It's not on the news like 9/11. Nine-eleven had several, several memorial television programs to it that air every year on 9/11. But there's nothing on Beirut.' Tragedy: Former Marine Ed Ayers remembers the 241 Americans killed in the bombing . The anniversary is marked annually here because many of the Americans killed were members of Camp Lejeune's 24th Marine Amphibious Unit. In all, 220 Marines, 18 sailors and three soldiers were killed. A terrorist attack the same day against French peacekeepers in Beirut killed 58. American, French, British and Italian troops arrived in Lebanon to try stabilizing the country bloodied by a civil war between Christians allied with Israel and Muslims. The bombing was blamed on the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran. A U.S. judge has ordered Iran to pay more than $7 billion to the families of victims, but so far they haven't been paid. A U.S. investigation said lax security led to the bombing and a report called for improving security measures around buildings. Carnage: Maj. William Winter was one of hundreds killed by a suicide bomber at an Army barracks in Beirut in 1983 . Terrorists: Two suicide bombers detonated trucks packed with explosives into Army Barracks in Beirut . President Ronald Reagan sought to retaliate against Lebanese militias by ordering the battleship USS New Jersey to bombard the hills near Beirut from its position off the country's coast. Months later, the Marines were ordered out of Lebanon. 'We just packed our stuff and went home,' Rick Von Bergen, 50, of Seneca Falls, N.Y., said bitterly. 'We didn't do anything. Nothing. Nothing.' Von Bergen was a Marine payroll clerk and asleep in another building when the barracks blast shook him awake. He and his comrades struggled to tend to the injured, wrapping wounds in shipping plastic, wet towels and whatever else they could find. Homeless and living off a disability check for post-traumatic stress, Von Bergen said he can still hear their screaming in his dreams. 'It is very tough to talk about,' he said. The Wall: The Beirut Memorial is at Camp Lejune, North Carolina. It was dedicated in 1986 . Retired Col. Tim Geraghty, commander of the U.S. peacekeeping contingent, had just returned to his office in the building behind the barracks when the bomb blew his door off its hinges. He believes jihadi terrorists drew inspiration from the bombing. 'Acts of terrorism have become a staple on our evening news reports, and seem to be increasing,' Geraghty said. Former Lance Cpl. John L'Heureux was on lookout on the barracks roof when the whole structure lurched upward with the force of the blast. 'I don't know how many feet it went up, and then it just collapsed,' said the 49-year-old man from Randolph, Mass. Comrades digging him out dropped a cinder block on his head, leaving a whitish L-shaped scar on the right side of his scalp. He lifted his shirt and revealed puckered and jagged scars on his side, back and stomach from where he was impaled on a chair. In addition to the 241 American deaths, 58 French soldiers also were killed in the blast . He longed to retaliate. 'I would have liked to have seen them wiped off the face of the earth,' he said. He also lamented the lack of attention this seminal moment receives 30 years later. 'I remember last year I picked up the paper on Oct. 23, and there wasn't one thing in the paper, there wasn't one thing on the radio,' he said. 'They say, `Will people always remember 9/11?' And everybody's saying, `Yes. Yes.' But they won't. As time goes by, they're going to forget. Unless you were personally hurt or a loved one hurt and something like that, you're going to forget.'","The blast occurred during the 1983 during the Lebanese Civil War .

The 12-year-old daughter of accused Utah murderer Dr. Martin MacNeill will take the stand to testify about the night her father is accused of murdering her mother. Ada MacNeill was just six years old in April 2007 when she discovered her mother dying in the bathtub of their Pleasant Grove, Utah home. One of Martin and the late Michele’s eight children, Ada’s testimony is the latest in a series of intriguing twists in the case. On Wednesday, a doctor testified the MacNeill offered him $10,000 in an emergency room to keep trying to resuscitate his wife. Scroll down for video... Plot thickens: The trial of Dr. Martin MacNeill, a Utah father of eight and Mormon bishop, will heat up Thursday as his children prepare to take the stand against him. First up is Ada MacNeill, who was 6 when she found her mother dying in the bathtub . Family divided: Ada MacNeill (left), 12,will take the stand . against her father, Martin MacNeill (right), who is accused of murdering . his wife in 2007 by drugging her and coaxing her into the bathtub . While several of the children are preparing to testify against their father, prosecutors want Ada to go first. Doomed: Ada MacNeill recalled that her father told her to go check on her mother, pictured, the day she died . ‘We want Ada to testify because she has an important story to tell as part of the bigger story here,’ Prosecutor Chad Grunander told reporters. ‘She was the first person to find her mother in the bathtub.’ The defense team, meanwhile, says Ada was too young and unreliable at the time of the incident and that interviewers had to use her older sister Alexis as an intermediary. ‘Alexis was doing the interviewing and investigators saying ask her this ask her that. This is highly improper,’ said defense attorney Susanne Gustin. Others among the family’s children will likely soon follow Ada. After . MacNeill’s arrest in August 2012, sisters Alexis Somers and Rachel . MacNeill told Good Morning America that they knew their father killed . their mother, even when her death was first ruled to have been from . natural causes. ‘We know he's guilty. We know he'll harm again. If he's let out he will come after us,' Rachel MacNeill said. The . women had long fought for police to re-open the case into their . mother's death, certain their father had murdered after Michele . MacNeill, 50, was found drowned in the bathtub at their Pleasant Grove . home in 2007. 'It's . horrible to be happy about the arrest of your father, but finally he is . being held accountable for murdering my mother,' Alexis Somers said. Plotted: Prosecutors say MacNeill convinced his wife to get a facelift then drugged her and coaxed her into the tub, where she drowned . Vindicated? MacNeill's daughters Alexis Somers and Rachel MacNeill will testify against their father, whom they have long believed to be responsible for their mother's death, but prosecutors say Ada is up first . Safe haven: Michele MacNeill was found floating fully clothed in a tub in the family's home in Pleasant Grove, Utah, in April 2007 . Another shocking revelation came Wednesday when an emergency room physician testified that MacNeill offered him money to try to keep his dying wife alive. ‘He offered me $10,000 to continue my resuscitation and not quit,’ Scott Vanwagoner said Wednesday. Vanwagoner said he was already working furiously to revive Michele MacNeill, and the defendant must have known his wife was already dead. He called MacNeill's remark ‘off-the-wall’ and the oddest experience of his medical career. 'Off the wall': Emergency room physician Dr. Leo Scott Van Wagonere told the court Wednesday that MacNeill offered him $10,000 to continue resuscitating his wife . Witnesses: Many emergency personnel have testified, including nurse Stephanie Hansen. A police officer also testified that MacNeill was out of control and hysterical as his wife was carted away . ‘I'm not sure how to answer that question, or why he would make that offer,’ Vanwagoner told a jury in Provo. It was the latest testimony about MacNeill's bizarre behavior on the day his wife died. Police previously testified to MacNeill's erratic behavior that night. 'He was hysterical. He was blurting out things like why did u have to have this surgery? Why were you on so many medications? Why God,' Dan Beckstrom with Pleasant Grove Police Department told the court. Police and paramedics have testified that he had cursed his 50-year-old wife after they arrived for insisting on getting a face-lift then taking too much medication and falling into a bathtub. Look of love: Gypsy Willis passes Martin MacNeill, a doctor accused of murdering his wife, after testifying against him on Wednesday. They had an affair for more than a year before the death . Fall from grace: MacNeill, pictured speaking with his defense lawyer Susanne Gustin, moved Willis into his family home as his children's nanny weeks after the death of his wife . Prosecutors claim MacNeill, 57, plotted his wife's death by drugging her and helping her into a bathtub. The 2007 death shocked the Mormon community of Pleasant Grove, about 35 miles south of Salt Lake City, because the suspect was a doctor and had been a church leader. MacNeill has since surrendered his medical license. Vanwagoner said every measure and drug used by the emergency team to revive Michelle MacNeill ‘had no effect.’ ‘It was an unusual death in someone we wouldn't expect to die,’ he said. MacNeill has said he found his wife slumped head-first into a bathtub when he returned home from an errand in April 2007. Police initially found no suspicion of homicide, and an autopsy suggested she died of a heart attack. But a cause of death was not determined.","Ada MacNeill is expected to take the stand as early as Thursday to testify against her father about the night her mother died in April 2007 .

Police in New York aching to catch world-renowned street artist Banksy have halted his activity for at least one day. With . public overtures coming from New York officials for people to file . complaints against the London-based man of mystery, and NYPD patrols . increasingly looking for graffiti, Banksy cancelled Wednesday’s artwork. The announcement was made late Wednesday morning on his website: ‘Today’s art has been cancelled due to police activity.’ Scroll down for video . On hiatus: Banksy cancelled Wednesday's artwork, it remains to be seen if he will resume his month-long one-man show . Early rumors swirled around the city . that the anonymous artist had been arrested, but those were shot down by . an NYPD spokesperson who spoke to Gothamist. The . website has announced the locations of each day’s work for his ‘Better . Out Than In,’ graffiti spree across the city this month. No further details were given. Just last week, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg bemoaned Banksy’s month-long ‘residency’ on the city’s streets. ‘Nobody’s . a bigger supporter of the arts than I am,’ the mayor told media. ‘I . just think there are some places for art and some places where… no art.’ Street sculpture: British street artist Banksy's October 22 addition to his New York residency was this foam and cement sphinx in Willets Point, Queens, though it wasn't there long . ‘Running . up to somebody’s property or public property and defacing it is not my . definition of art,’ the billionaire mayor continued. ‘Or it may be art, . but it should not be permitted, and I think that’s exactly what the law . says.’ It is not known if Banksy will resume his one man show tomorrow. Banksy fever took over New York as soon as the first bit of street art—a stencil of two boys stealing an actual anti-graffiti sign—hit the city as part of the artist’s month-long street show. Veles is not the first to profit from the class crusader’s work. When a painting of a beaver popped up on an East New York wall, some men threw a pizza box over it and started charging people $5 each to see and photograph it. But he might be getting the richest from the found art. WATCH MORE AT THE UNDERGROUND FX . Protected: The sculpture was, while it lasted, surrounded by a moat of stagnant puddle water . 'No turn unstoned,' reads the caption on Banksy's website. 'A 1/36 scale replica of the great Sphinx of Giza made from smashe cinderblocks. You're advised not to drink the replica Arab spring water' ‘A big gallery truck pulled up and offered me money. He gave me a card,’ Veles told the New York Post. Veles said a female collector was desperate for the work, but ‘I don’t want to say more,’ he said. Just hours after it appeared, the statue was being pulled from the ankle-deep stagnant puddle it stood inside. As a truck backed toward it, some people in the crowd yelled ‘all the way!’ in an apparent call for the sphinx to be destroyed rather than carted off. Sold: Just hours after it was sighted, the sphinx was sold by the owner of a nearby auto-glass shop named Bernardo 'Choco' Veles for an unknown sum . Quick turnaround: Veles hired 20 guys to help him get the sphinx loaded into a truck . One of Veles’ workers even sold a brick out from under the sphinx for a hundred dollars. ‘You don’t own it,’ screamed Darwin Requena from the crowd. ‘Are you looking to start something,’ the worker said in Requena’s face. 'A big gallery truck pulled up and offered me money. He gave me a card,' said Veles. Veles said that an unidentified art collector desperately wanted the piece and she was swift in scooping it up. 'I don't want to say more,' he said. ‘I don’t want to fight,’ said Requena. ‘We just want to take pictures and you’re blocking it.’ Banksy's website has been documenting, and sometimes commenting on each of his one-per-day pieces. For October 22, the site read, 'No turn unstoned. A 1/36 scale replica of the great Sphinx of Giza made from smashed cinderblocks.You're advised not to drink the replica Arab spring water.' On Saturday, Banksy painted a picture of a boy about to smash a water sprinkler with a hammer, titled 'Better Out Than In', on the Upper West Side. Saul Zabar, of the famed grocery store family, has helped add protective Plexiglass, to preserve the artist's work on his family's building on West 79th St . Graffiti reading, 'Let the streets decide' has already been sprayed over - and cleaned off - the painting . Banksy's Monday offering to the streets of New York is this picture of a young boy writing graffiti in the South Bronx, 153rd Street and Elton Avenue, while being served by a waiter in tails .

But, due to human rights appeals and other hold ups, at least ten per cent of the inmates were set free in the UK. It is embarrassing for ministers because Canterbury was designated as a prison specifically for overseas convicts facing deportation. At another jail, Lincoln, a Somalian rapist was still behind bars nine years after passing his release date because ministers had not been able to arrange his removal. The failures were identified in the annual report of her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Prisons, who warned that ‘cracks were beginning to show’ in the prison system. Nick Hardwick was scathing of the efforts being made at some jails to get foreign offenders out of the country. The report said that ‘in some prisons the relationship with the Home Office was poor or non-existent and foreign national prisoners had difficulty in progressing their cases or even knowing where they stood in relation to deportation’. At HMP Lincoln, the Somalian rapist, who was sentenced to eight years in prison for rape, completed his sentence in 2002. But he was deemed too dangerous to be released prior to his removal from the country, which is being held up by legal wrangles. Lincoln: A Somalian rapist was still behind bars here nine years after passing his release date because ministers had not been able to arrange his removal . Under human rights law, foreign criminals can dodge removal to Somalia on the grounds it is too dangerous. In a recent snapshot of the scale of the problem, Home Office figures showed that, on a single day in August, 937 foreign nationals were behind bars despite completing their prison sentences. Keeping them in jail costs the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds each year. The Lincoln case alone has cost the taxpayer almost £450,000. Yesterday, the Mail revealed how a notorious gang ‘general’ who poses a ‘serious threat to the public’ could be back on Britain’s streets within months because ministers have failed to have him deported. Joland Giwa, whose street name is Dexter, led a campaign of terror on the streets of Croydon, South London, and is ready ‘at any time to use knives and weapons’, police say. He was thought to be from Nigeria or Sierra Leone, but both countries refuse to accept he is one of theirs and linguists have now said he has a strong London accent, despite finding that he used English spoken in Nigeria. A judge ruled that immigration officials had three months to get him travel documents and if they failed Giwa should be released. The Ministry of Justice closed Canterbury prison earlier this year as part of plans to modernise the prison estate. The Home Office said it had unveiled plans to make it easier to deport foreign criminals. They include making it harder for offenders to claim they have a human right to a ‘family life’ in the UK, and the introduction of a system where criminals are deported first, then appeal from their own country.","Ten per cent of criminals at HMP Canterbury set free .

Barry Rogerson has been jailed for 12 months and banned from football grounds for six years after he admitted punching a police horse in the face . A football fan has been jailed for a year for punching a police horse in the face after a derby match. Newcastle United fan Barry Rogerson, 45, has also been banned from football grounds for six years after he attacked the horse outside St James' Park after the game between his team and Sunderland on April 14. Rogerson, of Bedlington, Northumberland, pleaded guilty last month to a charge of violent disorder. He was jailed for 12 months and handed a six year football banning order when he appeared for sentencing at Newcastle Crown Court today. Sentencing Rogerson, His Honour . Judge Paul Sloan QC said: 'You attended the football match and by the . time the match ended you were worse for wear from drinking while taking . your medication. 'You were clapping your hands at the police horse, remaining there despite repeated requests to move. 'When the crowd surged forward on two separate occasions you were clapping your hands in pleasure or excitement at the events. 'You . started clapping into the horses face. The police horse then started . moving towards you, you were told to move back by the officer. 'You had plenty opportunity to move away but punched the horse in the head. 'There . was a risk of serious injury from what you did. That officer could have . been thrown from the horse causing serious injury. 'On . this particular occasion you drank far more than you should have. You . are in a stable relationship and have a young son aged 11. Your position . is aggravated by your consumption of alcohol.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Rogerson pleaded guilty last month to a charge of violent disorder . Robert Adams, mitigating for Rogerson, told the court: 'Mr Rogerson was a man of good character. 'He . is 45-years-of-age and he, perhaps more than any other, has had the . humiliation of almost constant press coverage about his involvement. 'He is extremely embarrassed and ashamed of what happened. It has been difficult for him but also for his family and friends. 'He . has a very good work record of 22 years, it is only illness that stops . him from working. He has never bothered the police before in any way and . he has never appeared in any court. Rogerson was one of seven men dealt with at Newcastle Crown Court today having pleaded guilty to violent disorder . 'He lives on disability allowance and his wife is in employment. 'He is therefore a man of difficulties. He is not somebody who has ever supported or encouraged this type of behaviour. 'There is no question he had a particularly large amount to drink on this day. 'He had gone to watch the match, he was with a group of friends. Most of them were completely unaware what took place until afterwards. 'He was not involved in any trouble before the start of the match. He appears afterwards to have taken up a position at an early stage. 'When there was a line of Newcastle supporters facing the police he was joining in with the jeering that was taking part at that stage. Sadly for him he maintained his position during the two sieges. 'He did not punch any human, officer or Sunderland supporter in any way. No missiles or other weapon was thrown by the defendant. 'He has no previous convictions of any sort. It is not the case that he was involved in other acts of violence around the city centre. 'His wife has told him he is not going to another football match ever.' He added: 'Mr Rogerson has acted completely out of character while under the influence of drink.' Rogerson was one of seven men being dealt with by Newcastle Crown Court today having pleaded guilty to violent disorder. All were jailed. After the hearing Chief Superintendent Gary Calvert, Newcastle Area Commander, said: 'The images of Rogerson's behaviour were seen right across the country and further afield through the media and internet coverage of the disorder. His Honour Judge Paul Sloan QC told Rogerson (pictured) he had 'plenty opportunity to move away but punched the horse in the head' 'His behaviour is clearly unacceptable and he was widely condemned by law abiding and right thinking members of the public for his actions. 'I'm keen to stress that this shouldn't be the lasting impression people have of the city of Newcastle and its football supporters. 'The derby is attended by more than 50,000 fans, including families and children, and on that day Rogerson was in the minority of people involved in disorder in Newcastle city centre after the match. 'This is absolutely not reflective of the behaviour of true football supporters and those who live in, work in and visit Newcastle. 'I welcome the sentences passed today to offenders for their part in the disorder. In particular, with the next derby just days away, I'm keen to stress that this demonstrates tough action will be taken against anyone involved in such behaviour. 'As well as a potential prison sentence, banning orders mean they will be kept away from future football matches, making them a safer environment for the real supporters who want nothing more than to enjoy the game. 'It must be noted there have been 90 people charged in connection with the disorder following the match and the majority of these are still progressing through the court system.' The other defendants sentenced in court today after pleading guilty to violent disorder were: Alan Graham, 21, of Benwell - 18 months imprisonment; Michael Barker, 24, of Prudhoe - 18 months; Thomas Simpson, 22, of Prudhoe - 16 months; John Guthrie, 22, of New Hartley, Blyth - 16 months; Sam Miller, 19, of Harton, South Shields - 16 months plus two months for breaching a suspended prison sentence; and Robert Taylor, 18, of Elswick, Newcastle - 20 months in a young offender institution. All those sentenced were given six-year football banning orders.","Barry Rogerson admitted attacking the animal outside St James' Park .

The 'Angel of Woolwich' who confronted a man accused of murdering soldier Lee Rigby claims police threatened to arrest her after she reprimanded youngsters who allegedly threw eggs at her house. Ingrid Loyau-Kennett, 48, confronted the fusilier's alleged killer seconds after he was slaughtered in a London street. She now claims she was threatened with arrest herself after a group of young boys began pelting her house with eggs and stones. The mother-of-two dialled 999 before going outside to remonstrate with the youths. Criminal damage: Angel of Woolwich Ingrid Loyau-Kennett was threatened with arrest after she confronted yobs who pelted her house with eggs . Ingrid Loyau-Kennett was praised for her bravery after she confronted soldier Lee Rigby's alleged killer seconds after he was slaughtered in a London street . But she says when police arrived later they 'manhandled' her and threatened to arrest her for a breach of the peace - a claim denied by the police. The teacher and former Girl Guides leader says the attention she received after her appearance when Lee Rigby was killed has made her a target for abuse on her housing estate. She said: 'I've had trouble with these youths from the moment I moved in here five years ago - I think my accent makes me an easy target. 'Being on the television just made things worse. I became more of a target. I've never confronted them before but I'd had enough and decided to be brave and say something. 'They've been throwing eggs and stones at my house for months. On Monday night, I heard something hit my wall and that's when I caught them.

The teacher and former Girl Guides leader says the attention she received after her appearance when Lee Rigby was killed has made her a target for abuse on her housing estate . 'Sometimes I just find the eggs all over my walls the following day, but this time I managed to catch them in the act. 'I asked them why they continued to harass me and they began shouting at me. 'One of the young boys pulled his trousers down and showed me his bottom. Then they ran away. 'I called the police as soon as the incident happened. They arrived after 20 minutes which was useless as by the time they got here, the kids had left.' 'The police were saying that I should stop ringing them and that I had no proof. One of the policemen grabbed my arm really tight and twisted it. He told me that if I didn't calm down I would be arrested. 'They made me out to be the wrongdoer - he just wouldn't understand my side of the story and that I was actually the victim.' Mrs Loyau-Kennett, who is half French, decided to take matters into her own hands after three boys allegedly targeted her property in Helston, Cornwall, on Monday evening. The death of Fusilier Lee Rigby shocked the nation after he died in the street . Mrs Loyau-Kennett became known as the Angel of Woolwich in the wake of Drummer Rigby's death in May after she jumped off a bus to bravely confront his alleged killers. She has since written to the Minister for Policing, Damian Green, to complain about the behaviour of the officers. She says she was so traumatised by the incident at her home that she fainted and an ambulance had to be called. Mrs Loyau-Kennett added: 'I suffer from stress and anxiety which has got a lot worse since Woolwich. 'I stay in my house a lot more since the incident which means I'm targeted more frequently. 'Every time I try to leave my house they are there and I say nothing. I just don't know where to go from here. The police don't do anything.' Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed they were called out and a woman was given advice about her behaviour - but denied she was threatened with arrest. A spokesman said: 'At no point was she threatened with an arrest. The policemen gave the woman advice and left it at that. It is not appropriate to comment any further on the matter. 'We are aware of community tensions on the estate and are stepping up patrols with a visibility police presence.' One neighbour, who witnessed the dispute, said: 'She went outside and confronted them and there was a very heated argument - insults flying about all over the place. I tried to calm things down but it just got worse.' Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22, are due to face trial next month for the alleged murder of Drummer Rigby.

Missing girl: Madeleine McCann who has not been seen since vanishing from her family's holiday apartment in 2007 . Police in Portugal have reopened their inquiry into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, five years after they controversially shelved the investigation. The country’s attorney general authorised the move yesterday after ‘highly significant’ new evidence was identified by local detectives. She said ‘new elements of evidence’ and new witnesses justified the continuation of the original investigation. Madeleine’s parents Kate and Gerry, who were wrongly suspected of being responsible for their daughter’s disappearance during the shambolic first inquiry by Portuguese police, welcomed the news. ‘We are very pleased. We hope that this will finally lead to her being found and to the discovery of whoever is responsible for this crime,’ they said in a statement. The new investigation will work with Scotland Yard’s multi-million-pound inquiry into Madeleine’s disappearance, which was the subject of a major appeal on BBC1’s Crimewatch programme last week. She was three when she disappeared from the McCanns’ holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in the Algarve in May 2007. Scotland Yard began a review of the case in May 2011 and opened a formal investigation in July this  year after identifying dozens of potential suspects and scores of new lines of inquiry. Portuguese police said yesterday that their own review team had been working since March 2011 to reassess files from the original investigation and this process had uncovered new leads. A well-placed source told the Mail they could be ‘highly significant’. Authorities have put a secrecy order on the new material, banning it from being made public, but Portuguese law states that unsolved cases can be reopened only when there is strong new evidence. The fresh probe was authorised by Joana Marques Vidal, Portugal’s first female attorney general, who was not in the post when the original investigation was shelved. Scroll down for video . Breakthrough? Police investigating the . disappearance of Madeleine McCann received 150 calls from Holland after a . TV broadcast there . Metropolitan . Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley and Detective Chief Inspector . Andy Redwood, who is in charge of the Yard’s inquiry, met senior . Portuguese police in Lisbon late last week to be briefed on the new . lines of inquiry, which are said to be separate to those being followed . by the Met. The McCanns were also briefed. Mr Rowley said the meeting was ‘very positive’ and both forces had a ‘shared determination’ to solve the case. Home . Secretary Theresa May welcomed the development, saying: ‘I hope what we . are going to see is a resolution of this case for the sake of Maddie’s . parents and family.’ Earlier . this month Scotland Yard spoke of a possible breakthrough after it . emerged that officers were analysing data from the phone records of . people who were in Praia da Luz when Madeleine vanished. Wanted: E-fits of fair-haired men who may be . Dutch or Scandinavian who were seen lurking near the apartment in Praia . da Luz, Portugal, which Madeleine McCann was snatched from. Police . launched an appeal on Dutch television last week after a BBC Crimewatch appeal. Detectives believe . the two efits could be the same person . Prime suspect: These e-fits are of the man seen carrying a child 500 . yards from the McCanns' holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal . Officers said they had identified 41 ‘persons of interest’, including several British people, who were in Portugal at the time. They also released new e-fits, including images of a man seen near the McCanns’ holiday flat carrying a girl in pyjamas. Yard boss Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said this week that his force now has the ‘best chance’ of solving the mystery. Sir . Bernard’s detectives believe Madeleine, who would now be ten, was . abducted a few minutes before her mother raised the alarm at 10pm on May . 3, 2007. Disappearance: The Ocean Club resort in Praia Da Luz where Madeleine McCann disappeared from in May 2007 . Probe: Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood in the Scotland Yard incident room where British officers are launching their own search for Madeleine . As revealed by the Mail this month, detectives are also investigating whether she was snatched after disturbing burglars. In . the same week a year before Madeleine was abducted, a thief tried to . burgle another apartment in the same resort but fled empty-handed after a . toddler screamed. And . in the three months leading up to her disappearance, there was a . four-fold increase in ‘low-level’ burglaries at the complex. Response: After the couple's appeal on BBC Crimewatch(pictured), a number of callers gave names for the man police believe snatched Madeleine .

Probe: A PCSO guards the Coventry home where the tragic little boy was believed to have lived with his mother . West Midlands Police said a 21-year-old man and a woman, 25, were being held on suspicion of murder following the boy's death. Police were alerted by hospital staff and the man, who is not the boy’s biological father, was arrested in the early hours of Tuesday morning on suspicion of assault. The boy’s mother was also arrested on suspicion of assault. At around noon on Tuesday the young boy was pronounced dead at hospital and the couple were re-arrested on suspicion of murder.

Neighbour Oche Agbo, 23, said he had witnessed a disturbance in the street on Monday night, just hours before the boy was taken to hospital. He said: ‘I saw a man storming up and down the street in front of the house at about 11pm. ‘He was raging, really screaming and shouting about something. ‘He was clearly upset about something.

President Cristina Fernandez's spokesman said she had suffered a previously undisclosed 'skull trauma' on August 12. No details about this injury were officially released Saturday night. Spokesman Alfredo Scoccimarro read a statement signed by the president's doctors saying they did a CAT scan of her brain after the August head injury and found nothing wrong, and that afterward she suffered no symptoms. Forced leave: Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner attended a rally in the San Juan province just days ago but has been forced to abandon campaigning . But he said problems surfaced Saturday after Fernandez, 60, went to a . hospital for checks on an irregular heartbeat. Because she was suffering . headaches, they looked at her skull again, too, and found a subdural . hematoma. That means bleeding between the brain and the skull. The . statement defined it as ""chronic"" and not 'acute,' which suggests that . it has been slowly building. 'The president had a cardiovascular study done in the Fundacion Favaloro . and given that she had head pain, they did neurological studies, . diagnosing a ""chronic subdural collection"" (bleeding on the brain), and . they ordered her to rest for a month,' said the statement, which was . signed by the president's doctors. The statement added that her doctors . will keep close watch on how the bleeding evolves using imaging . technology. Head on: de Kirchner has been told by doctors to take a month off after she sustained a head injury in August that that was originally given the all-clear . According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the symptoms of . chronic subdural collections usually do not heal by themselves and often . require surgery that involves drilling small holes in the skull to . drain the liquid, relieving pressure and to reduce or prevent brain . damage. Her spokesman did not address during his televised announcement whether . Fernandez will try to keep managing the country herself from the . presidential residence, or formally take medical leave and hand the . government over to Vice President Amado Boudou, who was flying back to . Argentina from Brazil Saturday night. It's a hard time for Fernandez, a tireless campaigner, to disappear from . Argentina's political scene. August 12 was one day after primary . elections in which her opponents made significant gains. With the latest . doctors' orders, she won't be able to campaign for her allies ahead of . key congressional midterm elections on October 27 that will determine . whether the ruling Front for Victory party holds onto enough seats to . enable her to continue ruling with virtually unchecked power. In January of 2012, Fernandez had her thyroid glands removed fearing . that they were cancerous, but tests later showed no presence of . cancerous cells. She also suffers from chronic hypertension, and has . periodically had to take several days rest.","President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has been forced to take medical leave from her duties .

Chelsea have confirmed they made a written offer for Wayne Rooney but Manchester United rejected their sensational opening bid. Sportsmail understands the initial offer on Tuesday was £10million cash plus David Luiz or Juan Mata but Chelsea deny involving the two players in their bid. The London club then returned with a second offer of £22m outright - but that was also rejected by United, who told their Barclays Premier League rivals not come back with another offer. Something on your mind? Wayne Rooney arrives at Manchester United's training ground on Wednesday . David Moyes's first home game in charge of Manchester United is against... you guessed it, Chelsea on August 26. Will Rooney line up against his former side or will he be made to sweat until the transfer window closes on September 2? United have insisted Rooney is not for sale and Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho must now decide whether to submit a fresh offer. A statement from Chelsea read: ‘Chelsea . FC can confirm that yesterday it made a written offer to Manchester . United for the transfer of Wayne Rooney.' But in another twist, Chelsea appeared to suggest that Sportsmail's story came from United's training camp in Sydney. The statement continued: 'Although the terms of the offer are confidential, for the avoidance of doubt and to the contrary to what appears to be being briefed to the press in Sydney, the purchase price does not include the transfer or loan of any players from Chelsea to Manchester United.’ United insist they have not briefed the press on this story but simply confirmed the bid had been made. Chelsea have been . warned, however, not to return with a second bid as United have no . intention of selling Rooney to another Premier League club. Up for grabs? Chelsea have offered Juan Mata (above) or David Luiz (below) in part-exchange for Rooney . Arsenal have already made an initial . enquiry and remain in the frame despite also making offers for Luis . Suarez and Gonzalo Higuain. Mourinho is willing to sell Mata and Luiz and hoped the inclusion of one of them in a deal would tempt United to sell up. Meanwhile, United's chief executive Ed . Woodward has left the club's tour of Australia to try to secure Cesc Fabregas from Barcelona. Rooney feels he is at the peak of his career and has nothing to prove after nine seasons at Old Trafford. The England forward is understood to be ‘angry and confused’ over comments by new manager . David Moyes that he will not be sold because he provides important . back-up for first-choice striker Robin van Persie. The offending words were delivered to Sunday newspaper journalists during a briefing with Moyes in Bangkok last week. Moyes . said: ‘Overall, my thought on Wayne is that if for any reason we had an . injury to Robin van Persie we are going to need him and I want as many . options as possible.’ Uncertain future: Rooney was overshadowed by Robin van Persie (below) at United last season . Since returning from United’s tour of . the Far East and Australia for treatment on a hamstring injury last . week, the 27-year-old has made his feelings known to the club. He has re-iterated his desire to leave — . having issued a similar message to Sir Alex Ferguson last season — and . is now prepared to put in a formal transfer request. Rooney . wants to go this summer with the World Cup less than a year away, and . sources close to the player say he has no intention of allowing his . career to go backwards by being a squad member or playing second fiddle . to Van Persie. Moyes faces a quandary now the player has raised the stakes but there seems little chance of him staying. United have already discussed the possible . scenarios and believe that out of Real Madrid, Barcelona and Paris . Saint-Germain, the French champions would be their preferred buyer. Plenty to ponder: David Moyes speaks to assistant Steve Round, Ryan Giggs and coach Phil Neville . Then and now: Moyes helped Rooney develop at Everton (left) but the player is now far from happy (right) Mourinho added more fuel to his interest . in Rooney on Tuesday by warning that England’s World Cup hopes could . suffer if he stays at United. Chelsea appear to have settled on Rooney . as their main target after losing out on Radamel Falcao to Monaco and . Edinson Cavani to PSG. Mourinho said: ‘If Wayne is a second choice for Manchester United, then the national team will be affected.’ He also said that Rooney is 'a player I like very, very much.' He added: 'Being fast and direct, I like him very much but he’s a United player. From an ethical point of view I can’t speak about players from other teams.' Big fan: Jose Mourinho has not tried to hide his admiration for Rooney as he tries to bring him to Chelsea . Those comments forced Moyes to reaffirm his stance that he would not sell a player he brought through at Everton. 'Unless I was speaking double Dutch last week, we said Wayne is not for sale,' he insisted. 'It’s hard to keep repeating myself but I will — Wayne is a United player and it will remain that way. 'Jose said in his comments that he doesn’t normally talk about other players. But it does happen.' Rooney must now consider whether he takes the next step and puts in a transfer request. He arrived at Carrington on Wednesday morning as he recovers from his slight hamstring injury along with Nani, Nemanja Vidic and Nick Powell. Age: 25 . Position: Attacking midfielder .

Charges against the 22-year-old nephew of New York Giants owner John Mara stemming from a brutal assault at a New Year's Eve party have been dismissed. The nephew, also named John Mara, faced up to 20 years in prison if found guilty of felony first-degree assault and misdemeanor breach of the peace. The Mount Kisco, New York, resident professed his innocence from the very beginning, insisting he wasn't the person who battered party goer Phillip Blackman with a glass bottle. Boozy brawl: A witness picked John Mara (left), the nephew of the New York Giants owner of the same name, out of a photo lineup, identifying him as the man who hit party-goer Philip Blackman (right) with a bottle . William Dow III, Mr Mara's lawyer, was confident a jury would agree his client was innocent. He said today's dismissal vindicated that belief. ‘From the very beginning, Jack Mara swore he was innocent,’ Mr Dow said in a prepared statement, according to the Danbury Daily Voice. 'He did not assault the complainant,the evidence has proven his innocence,' Mr Dow continued. 'We are gratified that the State has agreed and that the charges are dismissed.' The lawyer trumpeted the decision further, professing faith Mr Mara was in an unfortunate place that he will not soon find himself in again. 'Jack is an outstanding young man and has a bright future,' said Mr Dow. 'He and his family intend to move on from this unfortunate incident.

When Mr Kazmierczak was later shown an updated photo, he immediately picked out Mara as the person he saw hit Blackman, police said in the original arrest affadavit. Also, David O'Brien, a friend of . Mr Kazmierczak's, took a photo of Mara that night and picked Mara out from a . photo lineup as the person his friend told him committed the assault, . the affidavit said. Mr Blackman said his friends told him he . had bumped into a girl by accident at the party and some people at the . party were trying to kick him and his friends out, according to the . affidavit. Police initially said that Mr Mara was upset after he was . told while walking to the house that his roommate's girlfriend was hit . by someone.

Just drunk college kids.’ Another witness told the paper at the time that Mara was defending himself against a bigger man. ‘If you have a bottle in your hand, you don't need to be [big],’ said the witness, who is also a student at Fairfield. Mr Mara has denied the assault from the beginning, police said. But they say when they first asked him why others were accusing him of the . assault, he said: ‘I'm not sure.

"By . James Nye . PUBLISHED: . 17:09 EST, 24 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:15 EST, 24 October 2013 . Seeking to avoid a . repeat of Facebook's much-maligned public debut, Twitter revealed more modest ambitions on Thursday, saying its initial public . offering would raise up to $1.6 billion and value the company at up to . $10.9 billion. The valuation was far more conservative than the $15 billion that some analysts had expected for the social media phenomenon. Twitter, . which has signaled for weeks that it would price its IPO conservatively . to avoid the stock drop that marred Facebook's offering, said that it . intends to sell 70 million shares priced between $17 and $20. IPO: Jack Dorsey, has seen the company he founded valued at $10.9 billion today as details of its IPO were released to Wall Street . Twitter is expected to set the price on November . 6, according to a document seen by Reuters, suggesting that the . stock could begin trading as early as November 7. The tech-company hopes to raise between $1.25 billion and $1.44 billion, according to an amended version of its prospectus filed on Thursday. Twitter said on Thursday that there will be 544,696,816 shares of its common stock outstanding after the offering. The company and its underwriters will begin a . two-week road show on October 28 in New York and will stop in Boston and . the mid-Atlantic region before touching down in Chicago, San Francisco, . Los Angeles and Denver, according to a source familiar with the . offering. 'It's conservative and likely going to be raised as they start the road show at least once if not twice,' Sam Hamadeh of PrivCo, a private company research firm, said of Twitter's pricing. 'The size of the offering is also a bit small,' he added. 'But they may only choose to raise the price once they gauge investor demand. Raising both the price and the size was Facebook's fatal mistake.' Facebook aggressively raised its price in the days leading up to its IPO and when it hit the market, it tanked dramatically - at one stage losing half its value. An investigation was launched into the public offering and it is significant that Twitter has chosen to launch on New York Stock Exchange and not on Nasdaq. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey (right) attended the Allen & Company Sun Valley tech conference in July with girlfriend Kate Greer . The IPO is one of the most highly anticipated IPOs in tech history with Twitter the last of the major social networking sites to go public. It comes after Facebook floated on the US stock market in May 2012 for $104 billion and, despite seeing an initial slump in shares, has since had a resurgence. It is thought that like Facebook, Twitter bosses' hands were forced by the Jobs Act which requires a U.S firm to file an IPO once it has reached 2,000 investors. Although the IPO was filed confidentially - the law allows companies with less than $1billion revenue in its last financial year to do so - the company was quick to announce its intentions, naturally, with a tweet in September. The company has been ramping up its advertising products and working to boost ad revenue in preparation. But it is still small in comparison to Facebook, which saw its highly anticipated IPO implode last year amid worries about its ability to grow mobile ad revenue. The decision to float the company is likely to see the company's founders Jack Dorsey, Evan Williams and Biz Stone stand to gain huge financial windfalls. The site was founded in March 2006 but has become one of the world's most popular social networking sites over the past seven years. Biz Stone is one of Twitter's three co-founders. He is pictured here in 2012 at at Canon's Imaginat10n Lab. He has also . helped create Medium and Blogger . Twitter co-founder Evan Williams was Dorsey's boss when Dorsey came to him with the idea for Twitter . Dorsey introduced the world to the site by sending out the first ever tweet which read: 'Just setting up my twttr'. Evan Williams . Age: 41 . Net worth: $1 - $2billion . Potential worth: $3billion . CNN Money estimated that he has a 12 per cent share in the company. His firms have also founded Blogger and Medium. Williams, a vegetarian, lives in the San Francisco Bay area with his wife Sara Morishige and the pair have two children. Role: Co-founder and former Chief Executive of Twitter . Jack Dorsey . Age: 36 . Net worth: $1.1billion . Potential worth: $1.6 billion . Mr Dorsey sent the first ever tweet in March 2006 and is thought to own a 10 per cent share in the company. Although he made his name with Twitter, most of his current fortune is thought to have been amassed through his estimated 25 per cent stake in mobile payment start up Square. He is a certified masseur and lives in San Francisco. Role: Executive chairman at Twitter, CEO at Square . Biz Stone . Age: 39 . Net worth: Thought to be around $200million . Potential worth: Around $2billion . As well as Twitter, Stone, full name Christopher Isaac, helped to create and launch Xanga, Blogger, Odeo and Medium. He is also CEO of a 2012 start-up called Jelly Industries, thought to be a mobile app. He has written two books on blogging and made his directorial debut as part of Project Imaginat10n with Ron Howard. Role: Co-inventor and co-founder of Twitter, CEO of Jelly Industries . The 36-year-old is also the founder and CEO of Square, a mobile payments company. He is reportedly living in a $10 million home in San Francisco and dating his longtime girlfriend, Kate Greer. Dorsey's interest in programming began at the ripe age of eight, according to a 2011 Vanity Fair article. He came up with the idea for Twitter in his 20s and shared it with Biz Stone and Evan Williams, two of his bosses at San Francisco software startup Odeo. Williams embraced the idea and made Dorsey, who was 29 at the time, the founding CEO of the new company. Stone, 39, and Williams, 41, have also helped create Blogger, Medium, and a host of other Internet ventures. Dorsey is currently thought to be worth around $1.1billion but the floatation could see that figure increase by another half a billion. Others that stand to gain from Twitter going public include early investors Union Square Ventures, Charles River Ventures and Spark Capital, as well as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen, Ron Conway and Naval Ravikant. In May of last year, Facebook priced its IPO in May 2012 at $38 per share, but the stock fell almost immediately, trading well below its launch price. The stock continued to fall over the next couple months, trading at $22 per share by September 2012. A year later, however, share prices have made a full recovery. Twitter's valuation is relatively conservative — some analysts had . expected the figure to be as high as $20 billion. Back in August Twitter . priced some of its employee stock options at $20.62. The caution shows that Twitter learned from Facebook's rocky initial . public offering last year. Rather than set expectations too high, . Twitter is playing it safe and will very likely raise its price range . closer to the IPO, and thus fuel demand. Twitter's smaller IPO seems to suggest that Silicon Valley has learned the lessons of Facebook's IPO, . which was marred by technical glitches on the Nasdaq stock exchange in . May of 2012. Those problems likely led Twitter to the New York Stock . Exchange. The .

A previously unknown layer of the cornea has been discovered in the human eye, a breakthrough experts say could 'rewrite the opthalmology textbooks'. Researchers from the University of Nottingham found the new layer - which is just 0.001 mm thick - within the cornea, the clear window at the front of the eye. They say it could help surgeons dramatically improve outcomes for patients undergoing corneal grafts and transplants. The discovery of Dua's Layer could explain the source of a number of previously unexplained eye diseases . Problems with the layer could also explain many eye diseases that until now were elusive in origin. The new layer has been dubbed the Dua's layer, after Professor Harminder Dua who discovered it, reports journal Ophthalmology. Professor Dua said: ""This is a major discovery that will mean that ophthalmology textbooks will literally need to be re-written. Having identified this new and distinct layer deep in the tissue of the cornea, we can now exploit its presence to make operations much safer and simpler for patients. Professor Harminder Dua at the University of Nottingham discovered the previously undetected layer . 'From a clinical perspective, there are many diseases that affect the back of the cornea which clinicians across the world are already beginning to relate to the presence, absence or tear in this layer.' Scientists previously believed the cornea to be comprised of five layers, from front to back, the corneal epithelium, Bowman's layer, the corneal stroma, Descemet's membrane and the corneal endothelium. The new layer that has been discovered is located at the back of the cornea between the corneal stroma and Descemet's membrane. Although it is just 15 microns thick - the entire cornea is around 550 microns thick or 0.5mm - it is incredibly tough and is strong enough to be able to withstand one and a half to two bars of pressure. Researchers proved the layer existed by simulating human corneal transplants and grafts on eyes donated for research. During these experiments, tiny bubbles of air were injected into the cornea to separate the different layers. The scientists then subjected the separated layers to electron microscopy, allowing them to study them at many thousand times their actual size and revealing Dua's layer. The authors say that the discovery will have an impact on advancing understanding of a number of diseases of the cornea, including acute hydrops, Descematocele and pre-Descemet's dystrophies . The scientists now believe that corneal hydrops, a bulging of the cornea caused by fluid build up that occurs in patients with keratoconus (conical deformity of the cornea), is caused by a tear in the Dua layer, through which water from inside the eye rushes in and causes waterlogging.","Nottingham researchers found the new layer - which is just 0.001 mm thick - within .

A wealthy widow accused of killing her Wall Street tycoon husband inside their luxury Costa Rican retreat in 2010 is now facing a new trial after her recent acquittal had been thrown out. Ann Bender, nee Patton, was cleared of her husband John's murder last January, but a judicial panel recently overturned the verdict on appeal citing inconsistencies, setting the stage for a retrial. The Benders moved to Costa Rica in 1998 and spent four years building an elaborate secluded compound on 5,000 acres of land in the heart of the Costa Rican jungle, complete with a circular glass house atop a mountain overlooking a 600-foot waterfall. Bad romance: Ann Bender (left) faces a second trial in connection of the 2010 shooting death of her millionaire husband, John (right), which she claims was the result of a suicide . The couple's dream of a peaceful life in a remote exotic locale came crashing down in January 2010, when John Bender, 44, was found dead in his bedroom from a gunshot wound to the back of the head, the magazine Outside Online reported. Ann Bender, then 39 years old, insisted from the outset that her husband - who much like her had suffered from manic depression for most of his life – killed himself. However, police investigating the murder were sceptical, and within weeks the woman had been charged with first-degree murder. Bender, a naturalized U.S. citizen of Brazilian origin, went on trial January 14, 2012, testifying that at 12.15am on January 8, 2010, she woke up in her fourth-floor master bedroom to find her husband naked and holding a gun. According to the woman, when she attempted to wrestle away the pistol, it fired a bullet that struck John Bender in the back of the head. 'He told me that he was tired of living such a hard life with all that he had gone through, he said he was afraid of hurting someone, and that he believed that I was safer without him,' the widow said in court, according to Inside Costa Rica. Brief reprieve: Mrs Bender was acquitted last January of the murder, but the verdict was thrown out, with judges citing inconsistencies in the case . The story of John and Ann Bender's marriage reads like a pulp fiction novel packed with every trope of the genre: astounding wealth, tales of alleged diamond smuggling and bouts of madness set against the backdrop of a tropical paradise. As Outside Online reported in a lengthy profile in June, Ann Patton met John Bender, a brilliant yet troubled Wall Street investor, in March of 1998 in Virginia. From their first encounter, the couple bonded over their struggle with bipolar disorder and depression. Mr Bender, the son of a high-ranking Justice Department official, ran several arbitrage funds and had a personal net worth upward of $600million. He was well on his way to becoming a billionaire when in 2000 he suffered a stroke. Around the same time, the successful investor cashed out and decided to move to Costa Rica, where he and his wife  - both avid outdoorsmen and nature lovers - planned to create a sprawling ecological preserve. The couple settled in the remote jungle town of Baru, Perez Zeledon, in Costa Rica, where they purchased 5,000 acres of land for $10million. After renouncing their U.S. citizenship and becoming permanent residents in their adoptive country, John and Ann got down to business of building the home of their dreams. Four years and more than $2million later, the Benders were living in a breathtaking nine-room, five-story, 8,000-square-foot glass mansion, which came with an elevator, helipad and moat. The Benders’ secure compound also boasted a sculpture garden and reflected pool stocked with fish. Into the wild: The couple moved to Costa Rica and bought a 5,000-acre tract of land in the remote area of Baru in the jungle . But the couple’s seemingly idyllic life in a utopian setting also had its dark moments. John and Ann continued struggling with their demons and would administer homemade remedies to one another in hopes of getting a handle on their mental health problems. The wealthy expats also were not strangers to paranoia, which set in after a 2002 incident involving an armed man who fired on the Benders’ compound. John Bender went on a mission to fortify their property, which he stocked with a number of guns, including a pair of illegally purchased AK-47s. The interior of the palatial home was lit with 550 Tiffany lamps, and the house was crammed with over 3,000 diamonds, rubies, emeralds and sapphires worth $8.5million. When officials later came to seize property from the residence, they ended up hauling away four suitcases bursting at the seams with precious gems, which were too numerous to count. In a separate case, Bender was later accused of smuggling black-market gems – a charge she has vehemently denied. According to local reports, the millionairess had been suspected of bringing piles of jewels from Africa to sell them at exclusive auctions held at her home. After a week-long trial last January, a Cost Rican court acquitted Mrs Bender, but the prosecution announced that it would appeal the verdict - a move that would not have been allowed under the U.S. legal system, but is acceptable in Costa Rica. Last month, a three-judge panel called for a new trial based on the assertion that the judges in the original trial had ignored a number of major discrepancies in the case, among them John Bender's position at the time of death, which was said to be inconsistent with suicide, and lack of gunpowder residue on his hands. Ann Bender has riled against the ruling, calling it a 'persecution' against her and her dead husband.","John Bender, 44, was found dead in his fortified estate in 2010 from gunshot wound to back of the head .

For more than three-quarters of a century, a four-fingered  chocolate bar meant you were eating a KitKat. But shoppers could now be offered an alternative after a legal battle over whether the shape of the snack is a trademark. Nestlé wanted to register the four-finger KitKat design in a bid that was resisted by Cadbury. Iconic design: But Nestle has lost an attempt to trademark the four-fingered shape in the UK . However the Intellectual Property Office ruled against the Swiss firm on the grounds that consumers identified KitKats primarily by their bright red packaging. It said the reason the chocolate-covered wafers were divided into fingers was to make them easier to break up and eat, making it a technical issue, rather than one of branding. Furthermore, the ruling pointed out that the four-finger shape was covered up by the wrapper so any imitator would not confuse consumers. This means Cadbury or another competitor could introduce a rival to the KitKat, first made as the Rowntree’s Chocolate Crisp in 1935. But the ruling is complicated by the fact that Nestlé does have protection for the four-finger design at European level after defeating another challenge by Cadbury. A Nestlé spokesman said the firm was considering whether to appeal against the IPO decision. Rival firm Cadbury, maker of Dairy Milk, said it welcomed the ruling by the Intellectual Property Office . He said: ‘KitKat was launched over 75 years ago and is one of the most iconic shapes of any chocolate bar, recognised around the world. 'In December last year, Nestlé won a EU ruling on the validity of their EU wide trademark registration for the four-finger KitKat shape so we are perplexed and disappointed with this national decision by the UK Intellectual Property Office.’ ‘The UK is the birthplace of KitKat and we are assessing whether to appeal.’ Mondelez International, the new name of Cadbury’s American owners, welcomed the ruling but said they had no ‘immediate’ plans to launch a similar product in the UK. Have a break... KitKat was initially called Chocolate Crisp and was launched in London in 1935 . Initially called Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp, the four-fingered wafer crisp was launched in London and the South East in September 1935. Renamed KitKat Chocolate Crisp two years later, it became KitKat after the Second World War.  Noone is sure where the name KitKat came from, but its thought London's famous KitCat (aka KitKat) Club of the 1920s may have been an influence. Within two years of launch, KitKat was Rowntree's leading product, a position that has remained unchanged. During the Second World War it was marketed as a valuable wartime food with the slogan 'What Active People Need'. KitKats . have been produced in a red and white wrapper for most of their history . apart from a brief spell from 1945-47 when it was covered in plain . rather than milk chocolate because of a shortage of milk after the war - . it then came in a blue wrapper. It was first advertised on television in 1957 and the famous 'dancing panda' advertisement came 30 years later in 1987, followed by the 'Have a break' series of advertisements in the 1990s. The two-fingered KitKat was launched at the same time as the four-fingered one, and the KitKat Chunky was launched in 1999.","IPO rules that the bar's distinctive shape cannot be trademarked in UK .

Texting while behind the wheel has overtaken drink driving as the biggest cause of death among teenagers in America. More than 3,000 teenagers are killed every year in car crashes caused by texting while driving compared to 2,700 from drink driving. The study by Cohen Children’s Medical Center also discovered that 50 per cent of students admit to texting while driving. Lethal: Texting while driving has become the biggest cause of teen deaths in America - killing more than 3,000 teenagers every year (stock image) Dr Andrew Adesman, Chief Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics at Cohen Children’s Medical Center, told CBS: 'The reality is kids aren’t drinking seven days per week — they are carrying their phones and texting seven days per week, so you intuitively know this a more common occurrence.' Dr Adesman, the chief author of the study, added that the current laws against texting while driving, which has been shown to make car crash 23 times more likely, are not effective. The study comes as many lawmakers continue to push for stricter driving laws. Earlier this year, Long Island State Senator Charles Fuschillo proposed harsher penalties for distracted drivers, including increased fines for talking or texting on a mobile phone. He said: 'It goes up to $400 but all the penalties in the world aren’t going to stop someone from being irresponsible.' The parents of college student Alexander Heit, 22, released a picture of the text message he was typing just moments before he was killed in a car crash in April. They hope the image will help prevent further deaths caused by drivers using mobile phones while behind the wheel. His final text cut off in mid-sentence, because he drifted into oncoming traffic before he could send it. The photo, published in The Greeley Tribune, shows Heit was responding to a friend by typing 'Sounds good my man, seeya soon, ill tw' before he crashed. The parents of the University of Northern Colorado student decided to release the image to try and prevent similar deaths from happening in the future. In a statement released through police, Heit's mother said she doesn't want anyone else to lose someone to texting while driving. 'I can’t bear the thought of anyone else having to go through something like this,' Sharon Heit said. 'In a split second you could ruin your future, injure or kill others, and tear a hole in the heart of everyone who loves you.' The Senator added that one possible . solution would be the use of phone apps that restrict texts and calls to . a mobile when it detects the phone is in a moving car. Some schools across the U.S have introduced educational classes to try and prevent its students from texting while driving. Manhattan schoolteacher Julius Khan told CBS he urges his students to 'think about your mother and father crying over your grave or someone’s else grave that you’re responsible for killing'. 'Pay attention to what you’re doing because the life you save could be your own,' Khan added. The New York Institute of Technology in Old Westbury and Freeport High School has launched driving simulations demonstrating the dangers of texting behind the wheel. It comes as the UK unveiled plans to increase fines for texting while driving by 50 per cent to £90. The higher fine will also apply to a range of other fixed penalty offences, including speeding and running a red light. A new fixed penalty of a £90 fine plus . three points will also be introduced for careless driving such as cutting up . other drivers, tailgating, middle-lane hogging, eating a sandwich or . lighting a cigarette at the wheel, or driving at an inappropriate speed. But the number of penalty points offenders receive on their licence will remain at three, sparking criticism that the penalties need to go further. There had been calls for the 150,000 or more drivers a year convicted of offences involving mobile phones to incur a six-point penalty. More than a million motorists have been convicted of using a hand-held mobile phone behind the wheel since 2003, with a peak of 161,096 convictions in 2010. An AA/Populus poll found that 42 per cent of drivers admit using hand-held mobiles illegally and 20 per cent admit to having sent a text at the wheel. Research carried out for Which? found that texting and tweeting at the wheel caused a 79 per cent drop in the driver's attention – up to seven times more than in someone at the legal drink-drive limit. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: 'With both texting and hand-held use of mobile phones at the wheel causing more impairment than being at the drink-drive limit or under the influence of cannabis, the police need to target the large number of motorists continuing to flout the law.'","More than 3,000 teens are killed every year in car crashes caused by texting .

Obama bestowed the Medal of Honor on Carter, who resupplied ammunition, provided first aid to the injured, and risked his life to save others during a six hour 'blizzard of bullets and steel' that reigned down on Command Outpost Keating in October 2009. The husband and father of three was also praised by the president for 'his courage in the other battle he has fought,' referring to the injured soldier's openness about his battle with post-traumatic stress syndrome.

House ceremony today, making the Spokane, Washington native only the fifth . living recipient of the decoration for heroic actions in Iraq or . Afghanistan. Carter's finest hour came at the bloody battle of Kamdesh in eastern Afghanistan when he was a specialist stationed with the Army's Black Knight Troop at Keating. On October 3, 2009 more than 300 Afghan insurgents launched a coordinated attack at 3am on the remote outpost, a vulnerable position surrounded by the craggy Hindu Kush mountains in Afghanistan's Nuristan province. Of the 53 soldiers stationed at the base, eight were killed and 25 injured. 'We kinda knew what was going to happen. We just didn't know when,' Carter told CBS, calling their position, surrounded on all sides by mountains as 'undefendable.' 'We knew that the enemy would take advantage of the terrain and hit us hard.' Head honcho: Carter, 33, is seen here in military fatigues alongside his wife Shannon. They were on a family vacation when President Obama called to inform him of his honor .

Portrait of a soldier: Ty Carter posed for this photograph at Forward Operating Base Bostick in Kunar province, east of Kabul, Afghanistan in 2010 . Carter himself was wounded but still battled against enemy combatants under intense pressure. 'The enemy was above us, behind us, all around us,' Carter told CBS News. 'We were cut off, surrounded, outnumbered, outgunned, low on ammo and everybody friendly who was in sight was either wounded or dead.' 'Perhaps 10 times,' said President Obama, Carter crisscrossed through showers of enemy fire. At . one point in the battle, Carter carried Specialist Stephan L. Mace to . safety, putting down his own weapon and facing open fire. 'It almost looked like he was crying,' said Carter, 'but he was too dehydrated to form any tears. He said, ""Please help me.""' 'Without . regard to his own safety, Specialist Ty Michael Carter... resupplied . ammunition to fighting positions, provided first aid to a battle buddy, . killed enemy troops, and valiantly risked his own life to save a fellow . soldier who was injured and pinned down by overwhelming enemy fire,' the . Army reported in its citation of Carter. 'He did all this while under heavy small arms and indirect fire that lasted more than six hours.' Carter was later told it was a good way to get killed. 'But I wasn't thinking of that at the time,' he said. 'I was thinking the more bullets I saw impact the faster I needed to go.' Mace later died from his injuries, which Carter told CBS left him 'shattered.' 'The fact that either I didn't get to him in time or I didn't do the right thing made me believe that I had failed fully and completely,' he said. It was the events of the Battle of Kamdesh that brought on Carter's PTSD, which President Obama mentioned today. Happy: Carter and his wife Shannon, pause for a photo on their wedding day, March 17, 2012, along the waterfront in Tacoma, Washington . Gallant: Obama and Carter walk into the White House's East Room, where Carter was honored for his 'conspicuous gallantry' 'Blizzard of bullets and steel': Obama painted a terrifying picture of the conditions in which Carter shined in the 2009 Afghanistan firefight . Position to make change: Carter has been working to ensure returning soldiers receive the mental-health care they need following his own PTSD . Obama said it was 'absolutely critical.. to put an end to any stigma' that prevents troops from getting treatment for PTSD. Ty Carter spoke to CBS about his battle with PTSD recently. 'I don't like the 'D' on the end,' Carter said. 'I . don't believe in calling it a disorder,' he said. 'I believe that it's your body . and mind's natural reaction to something traumatic... And if PT, . post-traumatic stress is intense enough, it will affect your life. It . will remove your ability to be happy and enjoy the company of your loved . ones.' According to The Washington Post, the battle claimed a ninth life in Specialist Edward W. Faulkner Jr, . who also battled post-traumatic stress disorder upon his return from . duty and sadly committed suicide less than a year after the attack. Since he returned home, Carter has become active in helping returning veterans get the mental healthcare they need and trying to remove the stigma attached to PTSD. A Pentagon review later found that the Keating Outpost, which was closed immediately after the attack, should never have existed because it was too dangerous and almost impossible to defend.

Fauja Singh finished the Hong Kong marathon's 10km (6.25 mile) race in a time of one hour, 32 minutes and 28 seconds. Mr Singh, a Sikh, completed the race accompanied by runners from Hong Kong's Sikh community, joining about 72,000 other runners taking part in the marathon. Fauja Singh posed with fellow runners Cara Kilby and Billi Mucklowat the 2012 Virgin London Marathon . Between the ages of 89 and 100 Fauja Singh, pictured here in Edinburgh, had run seven marathons . The Indian-born runner, nicknamed the Turbaned Torpedo, had said that he would hang up his trainers after the race in the southern Chinese city, just before his 102nd birthday. 'I will remember this day. I will miss it,' Mr Singh said minutes after crossing the finish line. Mr Singh, a great-grandfather, became the oldest man to run a full marathon at Toronto in 2011, at the age of 100. But his record was not recognized by Guinness World Records because he doesn't have a birth certificate to prove his age. Mr Singh has a British passport that shows his date of birth as April 1, 1911, while a letter from Indian government officials states that birth records were not kept in 1911. 'I am feeling a bit of happiness and a bit of sadness mixed together. I am happy that I am retiring at the top of the game but I am sad that the time has come for me to not be part of it,' Mr Singh said in a pre-race interview. Running has taken Fauja Singh all over the world, including Frankfurt, Germany (left) and Mumbai, India (right) 'And there will always be times in the future where I will be thinking, ""Well, I used to do that""', the Punjabi-speaking Singh said through his coach and interpreter, Harmander Singh. Mr Singh took up running as a way to get over depression after his wife and son died in quick succession in India. The death in 1994 of his son took a particularly hard toll on Mr Singh because of its grisly nature. Mr Singh and his son, Kuldip, both farmers, were checking on their fields in the middle of a storm when a piece of corrugated metal blown by the wind decapitated Kuldip in front of his father's eyes. Mr Singh, whose five other children had emigrated, was left alone. 'He didn't think his life was worth living without his son,' coach Harmander Singh said. He went to live with his youngest son in London and attended tournaments organized by the Sikh community including sprinting events. He met some Sikh marathon runners who encouraged him to take up long-distance running. One day he saw a marathon on television for the first time and decided he would try it out. In 2000, at the age of 89, he ran the London marathon, his first, and went on to do eight more. His best time was 5 hours and 40 minutes at the 2003 Toronto marathon. 'From a tragedy has come a lot of success and happiness,' Mr Singh said before the race as he explained how running has changed his life, allowing an illiterate farmer to travel the world, meet dignitaries and stay in five-star hotels. Following his retirement from racing, he said he hoped 'people will remember me and not forget me.' He also wanted people to continue to invite him to events 'rather than forget me altogether just because I don't run anymore.'","Fauja Singh ran first marathon aged 89 and has run all over the world .

Brussels red tape is ‘throttling’ British business, David Cameron has warned ahead of a summit with European Union leaders. The Prime Minister is to push for a one-in, one-out rule, to halt the growth in EU regulations. Mr Cameron, who spent the day visiting online fashion chain ASOS in Barnsley, will travel to Brussels Marks & Spencer chief executive Marc Bolland and angel investor Dale Murray to step up pressure for major reform. Fashion: David Cameron met despatch team leader Adele Simpson (right) during a visit to ASOS in Barnsley . Mr Cameron discussed the challenges faced by British firms with ASOS boss Nick Robertson, as he toured the firm's huge warehouse. Mr Cameron's wife Samantha is known to be a fan of the company, after wearing a £42 teal ASOS dress to the Tory conference earlier this month. EU leaders meet in Brussels today and tomorrow to discuss ways to improve growth and competitiveness across Europe. Ahead . of the meeting, Open Europe published a list of the 100 most costly EU . regulations to the UK economy using data from the UK Government’s impact . assessments of these rules. It . concludes they cost the economy £27.4 billion a year - more than what . the UK Treasury expects to raise in revenue from council tax. In . at least 24 cases, the Government’s own impact assessment finds that . the estimated costs outweigh the estimated benefits - meaning that they . impose a net cost on the UK economy. Business: The Prime Minister discussed the impact of regulation with CEO Nick Robertson (middle) and Account Director Neil Whitelaw . Mr Cameron will press the case for curbing EU rules and regulations to help business during a dinner with other leaders tonight at the start of the European Council. Ahead of the meeting he said: ‘On the red tape they are currently throttled with, we are dealing with that at every level, including at the European Council coming up this week, where I have organised a meeting for our businesses to explain their proposals for cutting red tape to fellow European leaders from Finland, Italy, Germany and elsewhere. ‘It is an agenda right across the board to help small businesses grow our economy.’ Mr Bolland and Ms Murray are part of the Prime Minister's business taskforce, which produced a report that came up with 30 recommendations to save companies billions. Just relaxing rules on health and safety would save more than £2 billion across Europe, it found. Fan: Mr Cameron's wife Samantha wore a £42 teal ASOS dress to the Tory conference earlier this month, teamed with a £196 Emily Wickstead belt . Leading businesses, including Vodafone, Tata Steel and Jaguar Land Rover, have sent an open letter to EU leaders gathering at the summit in Brussels warning them that bureaucracy is holding back growth. It states: ‘As European business leaders, we know first hand the challenges that businesses are facing in the current economic climate. 'One of the greatest obstacles is problematic, poorly-understood and burdensome European rules that all too often encumber business.’ The group warns it is vital that any EU regulation necessary for the single market is pro-growth, ‘enabling not hampering businesses to create jobs’. It points to the ‘concrete’ proposals devised by the business taskforce to cut unnecessary rules, regulations and practices that are ‘holding our companies back’, claiming the reforms could save European businesses billions of euros. ‘We are now calling on you, as EU leaders, to ensure that EU regulation is focused on securing the competitiveness of European business, and to place the 'compete principles' at the heart of EU policy-making,’ the letter adds. ‘And we urge you to demonstrate leadership by making a strong commitment at this week's European Council to identify where the burden of regulation can be reduced to allow businesses to generate the growth that will benefit us all.’ On the eve of the summit European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso challenged Mr Cameron and other EU leaders to cut bureaucratic red tape in their own countries and to stop ‘gold plating’ existing EU rules - making them tougher than originally intended. He insisted that Brussels was already doing its bit, repealing nearly 6,000 pieces of EU legislation and saving billions of pounds in the process since 2005.","Prime Minister meets workers at fashion chain's Barnsley warehouse .

They sound like fairly obvious requirements for any employee, let alone an upholder of the law: Don’t turn up for work drunk; don’t have sex on duty; be honest. The police force, however, thinks otherwise. So much so, in fact, that those three instructions are to be issued to all officers in a new ten-point code. Other parts of the code tell police that they should ‘respect and obey the law’, act with integrity at all times and not abuse their positions. New code: Police officers will have to abide by the new ten-point plan . Ethics: Mrs May used the speech at The College of Policing Conference in Bramshill near Hook in Hampshire to set out a new code for all police officers . The code is to be introduced after a . series of scandals which have shaken public confidence in the force, . including the Plebgate row and the investigation into the Hillsborough . disaster. But critics said . telling officers not to break the law or be corrupt – and reminding them . to be courteous to the public – was a ‘statement of the blindingly . obvious’. The draft Code of Ethics was published yesterday by the . College of Policing, which was created up to set and maintain standards . for policing in England and Wales. It . was endorsed by Home Secretary Theresa May, who  said it was . ‘astonishing’ that police had not had an explicit code of ethics before. The ten headings include honesty and integrity, courtesy towards the public, and equality and diversity. Under . the latter, officers are told to uphold the Human Rights Act, while . under ‘fitness for work’ officers are told to not make themselves ‘unfit . or impaired for duty as a result of drinking alcohol’ or using drugs. The . ‘work and responsibilities’ section includes an edict to ‘maintain . strictly professional behaviour when on duty, including not engaging in . sexual conduct’. Officers . are also told not to ‘use your professional position to establish or . pursue a sexual or improper emotional relationship’ with a ‘vulnerable’ person. The IPCC was given more powers in December 2012 for a probe into the Hillsborough Disaster . The code also . includes a new obligation on officers to report or challenge any of . their colleagues who fall below the standards of the code. Chief . Constable Alex Marshall, the head of the College of Policing, said: . ‘It’s right to spell out in plain language what’s expected of people and . also we have to learn lessons from the past.’ He . added: ‘We have a code of ethics for doctors, for lawyers for all the . serious professions and I don’t think they say they don’t need it . written down.’ He also accepted some individual officers had ‘let us . down’ in the past with their conduct. But . critics pointed to the oath which all police constables already have to . take. In it, they swear to serve the Queen with fairness, integrity, . diligence and to accord equal respect to ‘all people’. Gerard . Batten, of UKIP, said: ‘Aren’t these things that the police are . supposed to have been doing on duty since 1829 when the first police . force was set up? Do they know something we don’t that they feel the . need to re-state ten points of the blindingly obvious?’","Draft Code of Ethics was unveiled by the College of Policing yesterday .

The husband, known as Dominique, became so annoyed that his wife had become too scared to even leave their home that he decided to set a trap in his garden in Naintré near Poitiers, south-west France. He realised the thief struck on Wednesday and Sunday nights and set up CCTV in the back garden last month to do night watches until 3 or 4am. Snared: A husband caught a thief who had been stealing his wife's underwear for a year by staying up all night and hiding in his shed to catch him. On CCTV he saw this man wearing a hat, scarf and gloves creeping around and stealing the underwear . His dedication to catching the thief paid off - and he saw a man wearing a hat, scarf and gloves creeping around and stealing the underwear. Determined to catch the man and stop underwear being stolen when the washing was hung out to dry, Dominique extended his watch from 8pm to 6am, reported The Local. And on Monday morning at around 5.30 am he caught a glimpse of the thief on the camera going under the clothing rack. The husband then sprang into action in a determined bid to catch the man. Stolen: The man was angry after 70 pairs of his wife's knicker were stolen (file photo) 'He got down on his knees and went over underneath the clothes rack,” Dominique told local newspaper La Nouvelle République. 'I was in a little shed with the door half open, and I jumped out on top of him, but I slipped because it had been raining,' he added. 'At that point my two sons intervened, and got him under control in the end. They tied his feet together and we waited for the police.' When police found and searched the 35-year-old's car, they discovered over 30 pairs of knickers. They were taken as evidence and the man also confessed to stealing underwear from women in the nearby towns of Châtellerault and Cenon in the Vienne department. The man will now face community service, rather than a criminal trial and custodial sentence, according to the local paper.","Thief was stealing underwear from women in Naintré, south-west France .

Parents of a two-year-old boy who was mauled to death by wild African dogs at a Pitsburgh zoo say that safety fears about the enclosure had been raised before his death. Maddox Derkosh died on Nov. 4 when he fell over a 4-foot-tall railing into the exhibit, he survived the fall but bled to death after being attacked by the dogs. His parents Jason and Elizabeth have instructed lawyers to sue over their sons death. And although they admit that the toddler was picked up to get a better view of the animals, lawyers say that concerns over the safety of the enclosure has been raised as far back as 2006. Scroll down for video . Tragic accident: Maddox Derkosh, two, was killed after falling 11 feet into the dog pit at the Pittsburgh Zoo and Aquarium last November . At fault? The zoo claims mom Elizabeth Derkosh, center, was at fault for her son's death and that she shouldn't be allowed to sue them . The Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium has . accused Mrs Derkosh of negligence in response to the lawsuit. And has said that Maddox's death was 'caused solely by the carelessness, negligence and/or recklessness of Elizabeth Derkosh,' and that she shouldn't be allowed to sue them. But lawyers acting on behalf of the family say that in minutes from safety committee meetings in 2007, it was noted that a pane of plexiglass may have to be installed, as guests were 'dangling children over the rail at the wild dog exhibit.' The family claim that the zoo didn't modify the exhibit after the safety committee raised their concerns, but the zoo says that the US Department of Agriculture inspected the enclosure 35 since it opened in 2006 and had not said that changes needed to be made. Desperate rescue attempts by zookeepers and armed police officers could not deter the 11 aggressive beasts as they savagely attacked the two-year-old (file image) The wild dogs attacked the child so quickly at the zoo exhibit that by the time a veterinarian and other zoo staffers had arrived it would have been futile to try to rescue the boy . Allegheny . County District Attorney Stephen A. Zappala Jr. had determined in . November that Elizabeth Derkosh wouldn't be prosecuted and that Maddox's . death was a 'tragic accident.' Zappala . said the boy had vision problems and wore glasses, and that's partly . why his mother had lifted him onto a . railing to view the pack of dogs. She also told how witnesses described the boy lunging forward, as if he . thought there was some sort of clear barrier to stop him. The boy fell . and the animals immediately pounced on the child, who bled to death. Witnesses say he had 'no chance' of surviving after falling 11-feet into the pit while his horrified parents looked on helpless. At rest: At Maddox's funeral his parents asked friends, relatives and other mourners to donate toy construction trucks in the boy's name, to be given to a children's charity . The African wild dog is an endangered species which typically roams the open plains and sparse woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa. The dog's Latin name Lycaon pictus means 'painted wolf' because of the animal's patchy colored coat of red, black, brown, white and yellow fur, each with their own unique pattern. These dogs are very social, and packs have been known to share food and to assist weak or ill members. In fact after a successful hunt, the dogs regurgitate meat for those that remained at the den. They hunt in packs of six to 20 and despite their small size they prey on large animals like antelopes and wildebeests. They kill the larger prey by disemboweling, a technique that is rapid but has caused this species to have a negative, ferocious reputation. They are often hunted and killed by farmers who fear for their domestic animals and are susceptible to diseases spread by domestic animals. Its large teeth allow it to consume a lot of bone in the same way a hyena does and it has a bite force quotient - BFQ, the strength of bite relative to the animal's mass -  measured at 142, the highest of any carnivore, except for the Tasmanian devil. They are extremely aggressive and nearly 80 per cent of their hunts end in a kill - as opposed to a lion with a success rate of just 30 percent. There were once approximately 500,000 African wild dogs in 39 countries, and packs of 100 or more were not uncommon. Now there are only about 3,000-5,500 in fewer than 25 countries. Desperate rescue attempts by zookeepers . and armed police officers could not deter the 11 aggressive beasts as . they savagely attacked the two-year-old. Barbara Baker, CEO and . president of the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium said there is a net . below the rail, but the boy bounced off it and into the enclosure. She . said the animals attacked the child so quickly that by the time a . veterinarian and other zoo staffers arrived seconds later, they . determined it would have been futile to try to rescue the child. Authorities . said that zoo staff and then police responded 'within minutes' but . visitors described that time as being filled with screams for help. Zookeepers called off some of the dogs, and seven of them immediately went to a back building. Three more eventually were drawn away from the child, but one especially aggressive dog refused to back down and stop attacking the boy. It was shot dead by an officer. The other dogs were put in quarantine, not euthanized. The family's neighbor Rachel Majcher told the Tribune Review: '(Jason and Elizabeth) went nowhere without Maddox. I cannot imagine the dark cloud that is following them.' 'I can’t imagine as a mom myself what tragedy that would be, Your heart stops when your kid skins a knee.' She said her father saw Maddox . trick-or-treating in a Superman costume, and he could often be found . playing on a swing set with his cousin, who lives nearby. 'The hardest part is going to be to explain to my kids that their playmate is no longer here. His life will be celebrated.' Experts said the death is highly unusual. Steve . Feldman, a spokesman for the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, said no . one he's spoken to can recall any deaths of children at an accredited . zoo over the last 40 years or more. Feldman said the Pittsburgh . Zoo successfully completed its five-year review in September, which . means it meets or exceeds all safety standards. Zoo . president Barbara Baker told The Associated Press that when the tragedy . happened the zoo was fully staffed, including security. Pittsburgh Zoo had successfully completed a five-year review two months before the tragic incident, which means it met or exceeded all safety standards .","Maddox Derkosh died on Nov. 4 after falling over a 4-foot-tall railing into the exhibit after his mom had lifted him up to get a better look .

Tragic: Lucinda Woolley died after her horse reared up and bolted while she was riding down a country lane in August . One of Britain's top young riders suffered fatal head injuries after she fell from her horse when it reared up and bolted as she rode down a country lane, an inquest has heard. Lucinda Woolley, 16, was ten minutes into her regular morning ride when her horse Alfie, which she rode in national British Eventing competitions, 'started jumping and took off at speed'. Farm worker Thomas Hanmer, 22, who had seen her approaching, pulled his tractor to one side to allow Miss Woolley to pass, as he had done many times before, moments before the horse bolted. Mr Hanmer ran over to Miss Woolley and checked her pulse and breathing as she lay unconscious in the road following the incident at 10.20am on August 7 at Little Wenham near Ipswich, Suffolk. Her mother Julia, 48, arrived from the family home in nearby Chattisham before flying with her daughter in an air ambulance to Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge. The inquest in Ipswich heard how Miss Woolley, who was known as Lucy, underwent three hours of emergency surgery at the hospital’s specialist head injuries unit, but died the next day. The teenager, who was waiting to hear her GCSE results, had been wearing a helmet at the time of the incident, the inquest heard. Mr Hanmer, who has known the teenager’s family for several years, said in a statement read out at the inquest: 'I saw the horse and rider come out to the road and I knew it was her. 'Normally I just pull over and she passes me. I pulled up to let Lucy decide what to do and I noticed Lucy had pulled into a flat area which gave access to a field. Promising: Top young British rider Miss Woolley (pictured) was just ten minutes into her regular morning ride when the incident happened . 'She was having a problem with the horse. It was rearing up, it was rising but not too high - about a metre - it is not uncommon for a horse to do this. I expected her to get it under control. 'Suddenly the horse started jumping and took off at speed and raced away, she was leaving the saddle and going into the air. Then about 20 metres away I saw her fall from the horse. 'Seeing it happen I could not understand why the horse behaved in the way it did. The tractor had no trailer or external noise, just the engine. There was never a problem before.' Greater Suffolk coroner Dr Peter Dean said a CT scan at Addenbrooke’s Hospital had revealed she had a 'significant but isolated' head injury which was causing 'pressure inside the skull'. Active: Miss Woolley, who was a member of the Essex and Suffolk Pony Club, had been riding since the age of three . He said: 'Because there was very early signs of fixed dilated pupils it’s fair to say that she would not be aware of what was going around her after the moment of impact and loss of consciousness. 'It’s very clear that it was an accident that led to the loss of someone who was highly regarded and much loved. My thoughts are very much with the family at this time.' Dr Dean recorded a verdict of accidental death. Tribute: At the time of her death, Miss Woolley's mother described her as 'beautiful and talented' with a 'passion for riding' Mrs Woolley, a UK regional business manager at the Financial Times, described her daughter at the time of her death as 'beautiful and talented' with a 'passion for riding' and a keen sportswoman. She was a pupil at £11,736-a-year Ipswich High School for girls, but was due to study A Levels in economics, geography, psychology and biology at £12,252 a year Ipswich School.

Tennesh Massaquoi, 29, who has been jailed for five years after she carried out a 'relentless' two-month campaign of abuse against a five-year-old boy . A woman subjected a five-year-old boy to a two month campaign of abuse in which she sprayed corrosive bathroom cleaner in his face and doused him in boiling coffee. Tennesh Massaquoi, 29, inflicted a series of injuries, and attacked him by punching and kicking him to the back, legs, torso and chest. He was also found to be suffering severe bruising and swelling to his genitals. Massaquoi, of Greater Manchester, was found guilty after a trial on four counts of child cruelty. She was jailed at Manchester Crown Court for five years. Police said the boy was taken to hospital on Monday 9 July 2012, for treatment to a burn-like injury to his face. Staff had been told that he had sprayed a bottle of bathroom cleaner onto his cheek, and were even shown the bottle. Further examination however uncovered a catalogue of injuries to the boy, who initially was reluctant to answer any questions. Massaquoi was later arrested and the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was admitted to Manchester Children’s Hospital for a detailed examination. In all, the boy suffered a black eye, a full thickness burn to the back of his neck, serious bruising to his back, bruising to his legs, torso and chest, severe bruising and swelling to his genitals, as well as the chemical burns to his face. Analysis by four independent medical experts concluded the injuries could not have been caused accidentally, despite what the authorities had been told throughout the investigation. The experts also said that the bruising on his body was likely to have been caused by trauma, more specifically by punches and kicks, and the burn to the back of the neck was most likely to have been from hot liquid being poured onto him deliberately. They concluded that in all, the abuse spanned over a matter of months. The boy initially refused to speak about how the injuries were caused, but after days of careful questioning by specially trained officers, who were working closely with Children's Services, he revealed that Massaquoi had kicked him. He also confirmed that she poured hot coffee on him and said it was done 'on purpose'. Other disclosures followed, and further inquiries lead to witnesses also putting the injuries down to Massaquoi’s actions. She was jailed at Manchester Crown Court for five years . Detective Constable Kate Burrows of the North Manchester Child Protection Team said: 'Not only was this boy severely injured, he was also a terrified and traumatised child, who has been through more than any five-year-old should ever have to endure. 'The process of treating him and offering support to him needed to be a joint effort between the NHS, Children’s Services and the police. The response to this incident by Children’s Services in particular was outstanding. 'Specially trained police officers needed to not only support the boy through the investigation and subsequent court case, but also ensure there was enough evidence against the person responsible. 'The fact that after a seven-day trial a jury unanimously returned a guilty verdict in less than two hours is a testament to our efforts. 'As for the child, the excellent partnership working between all of the agencies concerned will ensure he has a safe future, and he can get on with enjoying his childhood.'","Tennesh Massaquoi, 29, jailed for five years for abuse against boy, 5 .

A Tory MP has told people who bought houses near a village cricket club to stop complaining about their broken windows and buy stronger glass. Charlie Elphicke said it was not fair for new residents in the Kent village of St Margaret’s to demand the club spent £35,000 on a fence to protect their homes from balls hit for six. The Dover MP warned the huge bill could force the closure of the club, which is just yards from his own home. Trouble: People living near the pitch at the St Margaret's cricket club argue they should not have to keep paying for repairs . Residents have complained to the St Margaret’s parish council about the impact of cricket balls breaking windows and smashing roof tiles. The council owns the the King George V playing field, where the club has two Saturday sides and plays friendlies on Sundays. Dave Hart, chairman of the council, said that both the council and the club were jointly liable for the damage caused. While nets were expensive, he thought . they might be the only option. ‘We are endeavouring to find ways of . solving this problem,’ he said. But the idea of erecting a 30-foot high fence to stop balls going astray was condemned by Mr Elphicke. He told MailOnline: ‘The cricket club has been there for a very long time, those houses have not. ‘At the end of the day, they bought these houses knowing there was a cricket club. ‘To turn around and say the cricket club should fork out thousands is not right. People should buy stronger glass. ‘An important part of village life is the village cricket ground and to pay a whole lot of money for these sorts of changes could well mean the cricket club is lost.’ Division: The row has dominated the village, where Tory MP Charlie Elphicke lives, with opinion split over who should pick up the bill for broken windows or a new safety fence . However, a local resident calling himself David, said Mr Elphicke had to ‘get a grip’, adding: ‘We can’t just all go out and spend £5,000 on new windows.’ Another resident, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Whenever there is a cricket match on everyone around here knows to park their cars somewhere else and batten down the hatches. ‘The balls come whizzing out of the ground like a bat out of hell and countless cars as well as windows and tiles of neighbouring homes have been damaged.’","Charlie Elphicke warned £35,000 bill for safety fence would shut the club .

More than 1,100 American cities have recorded their coldest-ever July temperatures as an unseasonable chill settles across a swath of the U.S. As temperatures struggled to get above 50F in many places, it was hard to remember the heatwave that gripped many parts of the U.S. in mid-July. From July 23, new records for poor temperatures were set in 1,122 places, with Salt Lake in Oregon recording only 30F on Monday - its coldest day on that date since 1976, according to Climate Depot. Cold snap: More than 1,100 American cities recorded their coldest-ever July temperatures . It was quite a change from the recent heat, when the temperature in Manhattan's Central Park topped 90F for six straight days, inching down only to 89F by 11pm on the Friday. Even Arizona, which has been suffering from devastating wildfires amid the heatwave, recorded some cooler weather. In Castle Hot Springs, a low of 61F was recorded on Saturday. The city, which on average would experience a low of 75F in July, last had a temperature that low in 1883, when the mercury struggled to rise over 62.1F. For residents in Nebraska, it was cold comfort that the last time they experienced such unseasonable temperatures was in 1862. Two cities broke their previous records, with Fairbury recording 48F and David City recording 48.9F on Monday.

Most of the record-breaking chills were recorded over the weekend and Monday, with the start of a cold snap that is expected to last for two weeks.

ScottishPower today became the latest firm to announce eye-watering price rises, warning bills will go up by 9 per cent within weeks. The firm, fined last week for mis-selling, claimed it could 'understand that these are difficult times for many families' but blamed rising wholesale prices and the government's 'social and environmental schemes'. It came as it emerged David Cameron’s plans to ‘roll back’ the green levies on energy bills could see the costs passed on to the taxpayer. Hike: ScottishPower became the latest firm to announce plans to increase bills by up to 9 per cent . Row: Prime Minster David Cameron stunned the Lib Dems with his pledge to 'roll back' green levies on energy bills but Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has refused to scrap help for elderly people . ScottishPower said that from December 6 domestic dual fuel prices would rise by an average of 8.6 per cent, adding £113 on the average bill. Domestic gas prices will rise by an average of 8.5 per cent and electricity prices by 9 per cent. In a statement the firm said: 'We understand that these are difficult times for many families and we have done all that we can to hold prices for as long as possible. 'However, following rises in wholesale energy costs, increased charges to deliver energy to your home and increased costs to support compulsory social and environmental schemes, ScottishPower is to increase domestic dual fuel prices by an average of 8.6% from 6th December 2013.' It comes after the firm was ordered to pay £8.5million compensation to customers after an investigation by the industry regulator found they had mis-sold gas and electricity. Households were given misleading estimates of how much they would pay for energy if they switched their supplier, Ofgem found. German-owned supplier Npower has said it will increase charges by 10.4 per cent to an average of £1,491 per year. And British Gas has announced a 9.2 per cent rise and Scottish & Southern Energy an 8.2 per cent hike. Ann Robinson, director of consumer policy at uSwitch.com, said: 'Unfortunately, the floodgates have opened and it looks like consumers are going to be buffeted by suppliers in very quick succession. 'The danger is that these hikes are sweeping households towards a cliff edge – when bills hit £1,500 a year this will be the tipping point where many will have no choice but to go without heating. This will have a serious impact on health and well-being.' The huge increases have increased . pressure on the government to act against the power firms which continue to make substantial profits. Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: 'With fifteen independent energy suppliers to choose from outside the Big 6, it’s surprising that these companies think they can keep getting away with bill hikes of this magnitude. 'As more and more people shop around for the competitive deals on the market, some of which are offered by the independents, companies like Scottish Power can no longer put their bills up in this way with no consequences.' Mr . Cameron sparked a furious coalition row yesterday with his promise to . cut green levies added to bills, with the Lib Dems accusing . him of making ‘panicky’ new energy policy ‘on the hoof’. Today . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg made clear he would not allow funds . which help the elderly to stay warm to be scrapped, but could be paid . through taxes instead of through energy bills. Labour . leader Ed Miliband has vowed to freeze bills for 20 years if he wins . the next election, while former Tory Prime Minister Sir John Major this . week called for a windfall tax on energy firms to help people stay warm . this winter. But during a . fraught Prime Minister’s Questions Mr Cameron rejected both ideas, . insisting: 'We need to roll back some of the green regulations and . charges.’ The surprise move . caught the Lib Dems off guard, with Mr Clegg only told about the policy . change half an hour before it was made public. Crisis: The latest run of price hikes by the energy firms has increased pressure on the government to help families struggling to pay the bills . David Cameron has 'lost control' of the government 's energy policy, Ed Miliband claimed today. The Labour leader accused the Prime Minister of making up policy without taking on the Big Six energy firms. Mr Miliband said in a speech to the Federation of Small Businesses:  'Yesterday was the day David Cameron lost control of his Government. 'In weakness and panic, he made up a policy on energy, which means business as usual for the energy companies, and which is already falling apart. 'There is no solution to the cost of living crisis which tiptoes around taking on the energy companies and reforming a broken market. 'But this Prime Minister is too weak to stand up for the consumer and he always takes the side of the Big Six companies.' Mr Clegg and Mr Cameron are expected to discuss the fall-out of the row at the weekend. But Mr Clegg today proposed funds raised on bills to pay for help for the elderly could instead be paid for from general taxation. He told BBC Radio 4: ‘We could perhaps fund that through general government expenditure but one way or the other these levies we do need to help those 2 million families with their fuel bills. ‘I do not want to turn our backs on the poorest in society. I don't want to turn our back on the environment.’ He added: ‘All I care about is the objectives remain clear and stable, helping the fuel poor, keeping the lights on, getting homes insulated and supporting our green economy.’ In particular Mr Clegg is understood . to be determined to protect the Warm Homes Discount, which pays £135 to . the over-75s and poorest pensioners to help with their fuel bill. It adds around £11 to the average dual-fuel energy bill, and would cost around £270million to fund from taxation. A . senior Lib Dem source said: ‘You can put this stuff on people’s bills . or you can fund it through general taxation but somebody has got to pay . for it.’ The Energy . Companies Obligation, which adds £47 to bills, is used for home . improvements but is not restricted to the poorest households. It only . came into force earlier this year. Energy . Secretary Ed Davey is already concerned that the Big Six energy firms . are not using the fund properly and it could be ‘tweaked’. Mr Davey added: 'The Government is looking at how to get people’s energy bills as low as . possible to help hard-pressed households. 'We’ve already increased . competition, brought new players in to the market to offer consumers . real choice, and the most vulnerable people are getting direct help with . their bills this winter. We’ll continue this work to make sure . consumers are getting a good deal.' Energy . firm bosses have been called to Parliament to explain the dramatic . rises at a time when families are struggling, with living costs rising . at twice the rate of wages. Downing . Street sources said that, if there was no policy change, green levies . could rise from the current £112 to £194 - or 14 per cent of the typical . household bill - by 2020. But Number 10 seemed unaware of Sir John’s dramatic intervention into the debate on bills, when he called for a windfall tax. Sir John said: ‘I predict this winter – sod’s law being what it is - that we will probably have a very cold winter and it is not acceptable to me and ought not to be acceptable to anyone that many people are going to have to choose between keeping warm and eating. ‘That is not acceptable. And so if we get this cold spell, the government I think will have to intervene. ‘And if they do intervene and it is costly I for one would regard it as perfectly acceptable for them then subsequently to levy an excess profits tax on the energy companies and claw that money back to the Exchequer where the primary job is to get the economy working and people back to work.’","Latest hike comes after British Gas, Npower and SSE unveiled rises .

Convicted: Former mayor John Larsen, who had an 'active interest in pyrotechnics' has been jailed for 18 years after he was found guilty of setting off dangerous explosions . Fear gripped a sleepy market town when a mystery bomber embarked on a campaign of terror, setting off explosions wrecking cars, breaking windows and damaging homes. As a former mayor, Liberal Democrat councillor and a prominent member of the Neighbourhood Watch group, John Larsen was at the forefront of those condemning the attacks. Yesterday, however, the shame of the unlikeliest suspect for the terror in Denbigh, north Wales, was complete. Unmasked as the man behind the campaign, he has now been jailed for 18 years. Larsen, 46, a married father-of-one was found guilty of three counts of arson, one charge of causing an explosion and a further count of possessing explosive substances. The former stonemason had denied the charges, claiming he was making fireworks for magic shows he performed for family and friends. But the jury of six men and six women, sitting at Caernarfon Crown Court, took around six hours to dismiss his version of events. Judge Merfyn Hughes QC told Larsen: ‘For some months you subjected the residents of Denbigh to a sustained campaign of quite deliberate terror. While you were detonating these explosive devices you continued the pretence of showing concern for their welfare. ‘I am entirely satisfied had you not been arrested you would have killed or caused someone very serious injury. You abused the trust placed in you as a councillor.’ Explosives: The trial heard that Larsen made his own Improvised Explosive Device which he used to blow up a car near his home in Denbigh, Wales . Blast: Damage caused to a nearby car by one of Larsen's explosions . Force: Shrapnel from the main explosion shattered the glass of a nearby porchway . Wyn Lloyd Jones, prosecuting, told . the court that Larsen got a ‘thrill’ out of setting off the explosions, . which began in February this year and culminated in a large bomb, which . Larsen detonated underneath a neighbour’s 4x4 in the Lenton pool area of . the town on March 24. The . barrister told the court it was ‘extremely fortunate’ no-one had been . injured by Larsen’s home-made Improvised Explosive Device (IED), which . was packed with ball bearings and sent metal shrapnel flying up to 90ft . away, smashing windows of nearby properties and damaging cars. At . the time, train driver Mark Jones, 44, and his partner Shirley Clarke, . 47, spoke of their terror after the headboard of their bed was left . studded with ball bearings. ‘It was horrendous, so frightening. We saw a flash and then heard a boom sound which shook the house,’ said Mrs Clarke, a nurse. The couple were so terrified they have since sold their home. Explosive: A number of improvised explosive devices were discovered at Larsen's home. He claimed he had been making fireworks, not bombs . Danger: One of Larsen's home-made improvised explosive devices . Bomb kit: Searches of the defendant¿s home found a book about 'the chemistry of pyrotechnics', a bag of 50 ball bearings, various powders and chemicals, a pestle and mortar, flares, modified fireworks and rockets and four other similar IEDs . Haul: Fuse wire and component parts found at Larsen's home. The court heard he had also been reporting his 'concerns' about explosions to the police to 'put them off the scent' The . court heard that Larsen, who has an 11-year-old daughter, was working . as a town councillor until his arrest and was mayor of Denbigh in 1999. He . pretended to be a ‘responsible citizen,’ by speaking to his local paper . to denounce the bomber and also reported his concerns to police. Larsen, . who was unemployed at the time, even spoke at a residents’ meeting . blaming ‘yobs’ for the attacks. He was eventually caught when Denbigh . resident Caroline Williams spotted Larsen ‘bending down’ by a Land Rover . Discovery parked near his home shortly before the main explosion on . March 24 and reported him to officers. Following his arrest police found files on his home computer containing research notes about how to make explosives. Police . also found a book about ‘the chemistry of pyrotechnics’, a bag of 50 . ball bearings, various powders and chemicals, a pestle and mortar, . flares, fireworks and rockets and similar IEDs. Shrapnel: In the largest of the explosions, an IED filled with ball bearings was detonated, causing damage to nearby homes and cars .

Anyone hoping to move into this high rise block of flats in eastern China probably shouldn't expect a room with view. While the apartments may look like they have plenty of windows, many of them are fake. Officials in Qingdao, in Shandong province, have claimed that a series of 'windows' have been pianted onto the side of the low cost accommodation for aesthetic reasons rather than to fool potential buyers. According to reports, the appearance of the block sparked internet rumours that the Government was cutting corners in a bid to save money. Others asked whether the construction company hired to build the Government-subsided accommodation had cheated officials in order to increase its profits. But local officials said that the windows are just there for decoration and that the block conforms to building regulations. They added that the windows are only painted on to a part of the building which houses elevator shafts. It is not immediately clear, but fortunately for residents there are proper windows on the other side of the building. According to reports, the Qingdao municipal government claimed on its official Weibo account Wednesday night that they had ordered the construction company to rectify the ornamental windows, which have been 'misunderstood' and caused an 'adverse social effect.'

It is hardly surprising that Chinese authorities are cutting the odd corner. According to reports, new home prices across the country rose by 8.3 per cent in August and authorities have been trying to cool down persistently high property prices in recent years.

An asthma sufferer died of pneumonia the day after a GP failed to take her case seriously and did not refer her to hospital, a tribunal has heard. Dr John Frain, Dr Philip Dodgson and Dr Andrew Ratcliffe are all accused of a series of errors in their treatment of the young woman in the run up to her death. The woman was a regular visitor to the Derwent Valley Medical Practice, in Derby, in the weeks before she died. Dr John Frain (right), Dr Philip Dodgson (left) and Dr Andrew Ratcliffe are all accused of a series of errors in their treatment of a young woman who died of pneumonia . The hearing was told how she complained of chest problems in appointments with all three doctors. She died on December 31, 2010, a day after she had a consultation with Dr Frain. The three doctors are facing allegations of misconduct at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester. Nicholas De La Poer, for the General Medical Council told the panel: ‘For so many people this is an extremely tragic case. ‘Patient A’s untimely death left her family and friends bereft and caused an inquiry into these three doctors with long, successful and unblemished careers. ‘Serious failings have been uncovered and some have been admitted. ‘I invite you, notwithstanding the emotional context, to set such emotion aside and consider the facts.’ Dr Frain is accused of failings during four consultations with the patient between November 23 and December 30, 2010. The woman was a regular visitor to the Derwent Valley Medical Practice, in Derby, in the weeks before she died . The GMC say he did not adequately assess Patient A or provide appropriate treatment or advice and failed to refer her to hospital the day before she died. Mr De La Poer said: ‘Failure to make a note of the second part of the consultation on December 30 speaks volumes about how seriously Dr Frain was treating Patient A on that day. ‘It is inconceivable that had he had things he should have at the forefront of his mind, quite how serious Patient A’s condition was on December 30, it is inconceivable that he would have omitted and forgot to make a note. ‘The fact that he did speaks volumes about how seriously he was treating the consultation.’ ‘For so many people this is an extremely tragic case. Patient . A’s untimely death left her family and friends bereft and caused an . inquiry into these three doctors with long, successful and unblemished . careers' - Nicholas De La Poer, for the General Medical Council . He went on to say: ‘His failure to refer Patient A to hospital on December 30 also reveals Dr Frain was simply not taking Patient A’s condition sufficiently seriously. ‘It is absolutely obvious that Patient A should have been sent to hospital on December 30.’ Dr Frain has admitted failures in his record keeping, but denies the remaining charges. Marios Lambis, defending Dr Frain, said: ‘Firstly we submit that the GMC has failed to bring before you a sufficiently cogent level of evidence to prove the case, even on the balance of probabilities. ‘Secondly that the GMC’s case comes to this: the expert evidence relied upon by the GMC tells you that Dr Frain should have done the things that are the subject matter of the allegations. ‘We say that expert evidence is not only flawed in and of itself, but that on scrutiny it must be wrong.’ He added: ‘Thirdly, we submit everything you know about Dr Frain indicates in the strongest terms that Dr Frain would not have and did not do what the GMC alleges. ‘He would not have been cavalier or risky in Patient A’s care.’ Dr Dodgson, who admits inadequate record keeping, is accused of failing to provide good care to his patient during a consultation on December 14, 2010. The GMC say he failed to adequately assess her, make an appropriate diagnosis, provide necessary treatment or diagnosis and give her proper advice. Mr De La Poer said: ‘The truth, I submit, is that it is as simple as it appears. This was a three minute appointment in which, as the note reveals, very little was done.’ Dr Dodgson claims that his treatment was adequate, despite the lack of notes. ‘Despite the inadequacy of the notes you can track his thinking and record that he has taken the right steps and made the right diagnoses,’ said George Hugh-Jones QC, defending the doctor. ‘He accepted his shortcomings. He was accepting of his naivety about matters after the death,’ he added. ‘We say his diagnoses are accurate and he must have been exercising care.’ Dr Ratcliffe has admitted over-prescribing benzodiazepines to Patient A between December 2009 and December 2010. He is further accused of failing to provide good clinical care to the patient during a consultation on December 29, 2010. ‘He has candidly admitted that on December 29 he just got it wrong,’ Mr De La Poer said. ‘He does not seek to dispute that he failed to take Patient A sufficiently seriously on that day.’ Dr Ratcliffe says he did consider alternative diagnoses, but admits inadequate record keeping. Richard Partridge, defending Dr Ratcliffe, said: ‘The failure was in not having a sufficient degree of the seriousness of these diagnoses, not whether they were considered or not.’ The fitness practise panel must first make decisions on the facts of the case before going on to decide if any of their actions amount to misconduct. If any of the doctors’ fitness to practise is found impaired they could face sanctions on their registration, which include conditions, suspension or, in the most serious of cases, being struck off the medical register. The hearing continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Three doctors accused of errors in their treatment of young woman .

More than 350 retired military dogs have been put down since 2009, figures reveal today. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) put down 42 British dogs due to a ""dangerous temperament"", while 27 developed cancer-related health problems. The majority, 117 were put down due to 'age and welfare' reasons while 76 had osteoarthritis. Four were killed in action in Afghanistan, and a fifth was put down due to injuries from a road accident. MPs and animal charities have called on the MoD to ensure euthanising elderly dogs is a 'last resort'. Liberal Democrat MP Tessa Munt said she was 'genuinely shocked'. She added: 'When the MoD . invests millions of taxpayers' money on training these animals, it seems . unfortunate that their ongoing welfare is not taken nearly as . seriously. This is troubling. 'I . have always believed that the way people treat animals says a lot about . them, and I hope that the release of these figures into the public . domain will lead to greater planning and a more compassionate approach . in future.' The figures have been released weeks after it emerged two RAF dogs which guarded Prince William were put down days after he left the service. Belgian shepherd Brus and German shepherd Blade were put down shortly after the Duke of Cambridge's final shift at RAF Valley in Anglesey, Wales. Protected: Prince William's two guard dogs were . destroyed days after he left the RAF. MP Tessa Munt, pictured right with her pet Poppy at the Westminster Dog of the Year show, said she was shocked by the figures . When the story emerged the MoD agreed to review its . policy to ensure a military vet and experienced dog handler are both . involved in every decision to put a dog down. A spokesman added a further 419 dogs were rehomed between January 2009 and June this year. A spokesman for the Dogs Trust, the UK's largest dog . rehoming charity, said it understood most ex-service dogs could not be . rehomed as pets due to their past. But he added: 'Deployment to another role or retirement to a . specialist handler within the service community are two options explored . by the MoD that Dogs Trust would always advocate for healthy dogs. 'The . Dogs Trust never puts a healthy dog down and is opposed to the . premature euthanasia of working dogs when retired or no longer able to . perform their duties. We actively encourage specialist rehoming and . retirement programmes.' Neil Parish, MP for Tiverton and Honiton and chairman of the Associate Parliamentary Group for Animal Welfare, said: 'Dogs employed in our armed services demonstrate commitment to their handlers and bravery on a daily basis and have undoubtedly saved the lives of countless servicemen and women. 'We have a duty of care for their well-being as real as the military covenant. 'I think it is vitally important that we make sure that none of the 117 dogs that were put down because of 'age and welfare' reasons since 2009 were done so out of expediency.' Military dogs are used as guards and some can be trained to sniff out improvised explosives . Mr Parish added: 'The government has stated that there are no time restrictions on a dog being kept while a suitable home is looked for and I hope that the Ministry of Defence bears this in mind.' According to the figures, 68 dogs were put down in 2009, 117 in 2010, 84 in 2011, and 71 in 2012. Thirty were put down between January and July this year. David Amess, Conservative MP for Southend West, said the sheer numbers 'led many to question the motives behind this policy'. The MoD said 'every effort' was made to rehome dogs, but illnesses caused by old age forced some of them to be destroyed. A spokesman added: 'The MoD has a moral and legal duty to ensure the welfare of our animals and only put down those dogs that cannot be rehomed. 'We announced in September that we would review our existing policy to ensure that consistency across the MoD. 'Military working dogs play an invaluable role on the front line helping to save the lives of our armed forces and local residents in Afghanistan. 'Dogs are afforded as much protection as possible and handlers are specifically trained to minimise the risks that dogs face in performing their tasks.'","Just 42 dogs had a 'dangerous temperament' - most had health problems .

Judge Chet Tharpe handed Christopher Renshaw, 28, the maximum sentence on Wednesday for sexually abusing three boys, the youngest of whom was 10 at the time. The six-foot-three-inch 240lb Hillsborough man threatened the boys, sexually abused them and recorded the acts on digital video cards. Shocking: Christopher Renshaw was given the maximum sentence for his crimes against three young boys . The abuse began in 2009 when the three young boys, relatives of Renshaw's, moved with their mother into Renshaw's mother's home. According to the Tampa Bay Times, Renshaw sexually abused the boys, aged between 10 and 15, and beat them if they resisted. He also taped the abuse and made threats to prevent the boys from telling their mother about it. The three boys, the youngest now aged 14, testified in court about their ordeal. They spoke of their lives since the abuse and their constant fear of being alone, their questioning of their own sexuality and terrifying flashbacks to the abuse. The Tampa Bay Times reports that Renshaw cried and tried to block his ears while his victims spoke. Renshaw's attorney told the court that his client was a victim of sexual assault himself. Custody: This mugshot was taken of Renshaw when he was first arrested in 2011 . 'This young man has problems that are not of his own making,' attorney Scott McCluskey said. 'Judge, punish him. But don't make him die in prison.' McCluskey told the court that Renshaw . had been sexually abused from the age of five, as had almost all his 17 . brothers and sisters. A . psychologist told the court that Renshaw is intellectually disabled and . the abuse he suffered as a child led to substance abuse issues. Prosecutors sought the maximum sentence for Renshaw, whose crimes 'made seasoned investigators cringe.' 'Christopher Renshaw did horrible things to these children,' said Assistant State Attorney Aaron Hubbard. 'I believe he's a monster. I don't believe he deserves to ever be out of prison ever again.' Renshaw lived in Valrico until he was arrested in 2011. In August, he pleaded guilty to more than 30 sexual abuse charges. Before he was sentenced, Renshaw spoke for himself to the judge. 'I would like to have some help,' he said through sobs, reports the Tampa Bay Times. 'I'm sorry for the things I've done. I just ask for a chance. Please.' Judge Tharpe was unconvinced. 'If ever there was a person that society needs to be protected from, it's you, Mr. Renshaw,' Judge Tharpe said. 'I have an intervention for you and it's long and it's called Florida State Prison.' Renshaw was given the maximum sentence on each count, a total of 690 years prison.","Christopher Renshaw, 28, pleaded guilty to the sexual abuse of three boys, the youngest of whom was 10 .

More than 20 years after their bitter divorce, Steven Hawking has paid tribute to his first wife who saved him from what he calls the darkest time in his life. In a new documentary about his life, Professor Hawking highlights his former wife, Jane Wilde, as his saviour from depression after he was diagnosed with the motor neurone disease in 1963. Written and narrated by the scientist himself, the film, Hawking, documents the fascinating life of the famous physicist. Scroll down for video . Stephen Hawking pays tribute to his former wife, Jane Wilde, in the film by highlighting how she saved him from depression . Ms Wilde is interviewed as part of the film, and talks freely and openly about the challenges of living with the debilitating disease which affected her husband's personality as well as his body. She is also credited with saving her former husband's life after refusing to switch off his life-support machine when he suffered a severe attack of pneumonia in 1985. Before . their separation in 1991, she had cared for the scientist in addition to . raising the couple's three children. Her interview in the documentary sheds light on the challenges and pressures of such responsibility. The film also features Mr Hawking's sister and several students and carers. Professor Hawking was married to his first wife for . 26 years before their marriage was torn apart by a whirlwind of fame and . fortune after the success of his book, A Brief History . of Time. In the film, Mrs Hawking reveals how her former husband's illness forced them into their own ‘black hole’ of despair. Jane Wilde cared for her former husband Stephen as well as the couple's children for many years with the famous scientist refusing outside help . She says: ‘It got rather too much for me to cope with. We ceased to be happy as before,' adding that there were 'two faces to Stephen.' ‘One was the public wunderkind who had . overcome motor neurone and was travelling the world. The other was our . home situation where his illness forced us into our own black hole.’ Prof Hawking, 71, met Miss Wilde while . studying at Cambridge when he was 21. Soon afterwards he was diagnosed . with motor neurone disease – a condition which has left him . wheelchair-bound for almost half a century and able to communicate only . through a voice synthesiser operated by a muscle in his cheek. Prof Hawking describes how he became . so desperately ill with pneumonia while he wrote A Brief History of Time . that doctors offered his wife the chance to end his misery and turn off . his life-support machine. But Miss Wilde refused to do so and her . husband went on to complete the bestselling book which has sold 10 . million copies in 40 languages. Prof Hawking describes the near-death . experience in 1985 as the ‘darkest’ time of his life and explains how it . was the treatment for this illness which left him unable to speak. He said: ‘It was very serious and I was put into a drug-induced coma and then on life-support. Prof Hawking suffered a near fatal pneumonia attack in Switzerland, and only survived after his former wife refused to turn off life support. He went on to write the revolutionary book, A Brief History of Time which sold millions of copies worldwide . 'The doctors thought I was so far gone that they offered Jane [the option] to turn off the machine.’ But she refused and ordered doctors to fly her husband, who was in Geneva when he fell ill, back to their home in Cambridge. He added: ‘Slowly the drugs worked, though a small incision in my throat robbed me of my ability to talk.’ In the film, Miss Wilde describes the . early days of their relationship, saying: ‘I was drawn to his very wide . smile and beautiful grey eyes. He  was great fun and we were together . going to defy the disease and the doctors.’ A Brief History of Time was finished . in 1987 and Prof Hawking had become famous around the world, but the . fame – coupled with his ill health – led to the collapse of his . marriage. Prof Hawking married his former nurse, Elaine Mason, in 1995. They divorced in 2006. He describes his second marriage as . ‘passionate and tempestuous’, but dismisses allegations that he suffered . physical abuse at his wife’s hands. Life expectancy for motor neurone . disease sufferers is about five years, but Prof Hawking says he is not . afraid of dying. He added: ‘Every day could be my last and, though I’m . 71 now, I go to work every day. I have a desire to make the most of . every minute.’ The film will open Cambridge Film Festival on September 19, and will be released nationwide the following day.

A pizza containing 35 ingredients from 60 different countries has been discovered by food safety testers investigating the horsemeat scandal. The 35 exotic ingredients - drawn from five different continents - were used as an example by the National Audit Office to illustrate how difficult it was to verify the origins of the processed food eaten in the UK. In a report on food safety and authenticity in the processed meat supply chain, the watchdog warned that ‘food fraud’ was rife. Multi-national product: Food safety testers investigating the horsemeat scandal discovered a pizza that contained 35 ingredients from 60 countries (file picture) In a report prompted by the scandal over horsemeat in British foods, the NAO said it had become even harder to determine what was actually in food because of the long, international supply chains. The NAO report said: ‘Recent analysis of the components of a pizza, carried out for the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, found that it was made from 35 different ingredients that passed through 60 countries, on five different continents.’ Irish authorities testing the processed meal did not name the brand. The pizza box had the label: ‘country of origin: Ireland’. The NAO also found that testing for the authenticity of food had become harder because of a split in responsibility between the Food Standards Agency, the Department of Health and the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). Local authorities reported 1,380 cases of food fraud in 2012 - up by two thirds since 2010. THE BASE: . Dough: France, UK, Poland, USA. Yeast: UK, Ireland, Germany . Salt: UK, France, China .

Chilli Peppers: 'Africa, Asia, South America' Just one third of local authorities recorded the laboratory results on the Food Standard Agency’s national database. And the total number of food samples tested by official control laboratories in England has gone down by a quarter since 2009-10, the report said. Many tests were now carried out by private food businesses but public authorities did not know the results. The NAO recommended that some money be diverted away from checking slaughter houses to investigating the factories where processed meat was produced and the long supply chains involved. However this change would require agreement at European Union level. NAO head Amyas Morse said: ‘The January 2013 horsemeat incident has revealed a gap between what citizens expect of the controls over the authenticity of their food, and the effectiveness of those controls in reality. ‘The division of responsibilities for food safety and authenticity has created confusion. ‘The Government needs to remove this confusion, and improve its understanding of potential food fraud and how intelligence is brought together and shared.’ Richard Bacon, a Tory member of the Commons Public Accounts Committee said: ‘The public have every right to expect that government should be able to provide a system to ensure food safety, to investigate problems where they occur and to solve problems. In this case, taxpayers and consumers were let down. ‘Food fraud is a serious and growing problem.

It later emerged that horses from countries like Romania were being slaughtered after suffering appalling cruelty and then shipped into the UK as beef products. Horsemeat was found in a number of popular products including Tesco burgers, Tesco’s everyday value spaghetti bolognaise and a Findus lasagne.","The ready meal contained 35 different ingredients from all around the world .

The label told the Wall Street Journal that 'new plus-size customers spend 25 per cent more per order, . buy 17 per cent more items per order than regular-sized shoppers, and are 66 per cent . more likely to spread the ModCloth gospel via social media.'

Lucrative market: ModCloth believes its plus size garments (pictured) could generate even more significant sales than regular sizes in the future . Samara Fetto, who heads up the brand's plus-size division says she believes plus sizes could generate even more significant sales than regular sizes in the future. 'Our small-medium-large customer has other options for retailers who . can steal a portion of her wallet,' she told the paper. 'For plus, her options are much more . limited.' Indeed, the average woman in the U.S. is around a size 14, however most mainstream fashion labels' largest size is a 12, presenting a gaping hole in the market. But while there is certainly a demand for affordable, cool clothes for the larger woman, relatively few brands have cashed in on it because the design and manufacturing process requires specialist skill. This issue was addressed by Brandon Wen and Laura Zwanziger, both apparel . design sophomores at Cornell University, whose research revealed that plus-size women account for 28 per cent of . fashion purchasing power in the U.S., but their spending only contributes to 17 per cent of sales.

'A lot . of the clothes [for plus-size women] are really just sized up from . smaller proportions, which fit really strangely,' Miss Zwanziger said.

Vince Cable faced fresh calls to resign today after it emerged Royal Mail could have been worth £10billion – three times what the government sold for it. The CWU union claimed that in any other walk of life, securing such a poor deal 'would be a sacking offence' for the Business Secretary. It follows reports banking giant JP Morgan told the government that it would value the firm, including its debts, at £7.75billion to £9.95bilion. Grilling: Business Secretary Vince Cable is to face questions from MPs next month on whether Royal Mail was sold off on the cheap . The revelation reignited the furious row . about whether ministers rushed to sell off the national postal service . on the cheap, handing big profits to City investors. Shares in Royal Mail were sold by the government at £3.30 earlier this month, which valued the firm at £3.3billion. But since then shares have soared to over £5, suggesting the company is worth £5billion. Mr Cable last week claimed threats of strike action forced . ministers to cut the value of Royal Mail on the eve of its sell-off. But CWU general secretary Billy Hayes said today: 'On the opening day of the flotation Vince Cable wrote off the undervaluation as froth. A week later, we were told it was the fault of the CWU. 'We now have a prima facie case of a conspiracy against the UK taxpayer who were opposed to the sale and have now been robbed of billions. 'In any other walk of life this would be a sacking offence and we call on Vince Cable to resign.' Ministers were again challenged about the valuation in the Commons today. Business minister Michael Fallon insisted that ‘price volatility’ was to be expected in the immediate aftermath of a sale. He said: ‘But let's be very clear this sale was popular, it was over-subscribed and it was successful.’ However, Labour seized the claim that the firm could be worth even more. Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said: ‘The news that yet another leading investment bank valued Royal Mail at a far higher price than that for which it was sold will only add to fears that taxpayers have been significantly short changed by David Cameron’s Royal Mail fire sale. ‘This latest valuation is up to three times above what the public stake in the business was sold at.’ It comes as the Whitehall spending watchdog announced it would carry out a value for money probe into the sale, to ensure the taxpayer was not ripped off. The National Audit Office said: ‘The examination will cover the issues of how the price range for the initial public offering was set and the discussion of possible revisions to the range.’ Value: The government sold Royal Mail, valued at £3.3billion, earlier this month but now it has emerged that JP Morgan valued it at almost £10billion . The news follows the revelation that activist hedge fund the Children's Investment Fund Management (TCI) has amassed a 5.8 per cent stake in Royal Mail. It has bought 58.2 million shares worth around £290 million.

Facebook has been accused of a massive 'data grab' after encouraging users to allow it to automatically synchronise photos from their mobile devices to the social networks servers. The social network from Friday began asking users of its mobile apps to activate its new Photo Sync, which will automatically upload each picture to a private album. Whether or not users decide share the photos on their public newsfeed, Facebook itself will still have access. That means it will be able to mine those files for their metadata, including the location where the photo was taken, as well as use its facial recognition technology to spot those pictured. Photo Sync: The new function being promoted to . users of Facebook's mobile apps will automatically upload pictures taken . from mobile devices to the company's servers - where they can be mined . for data . As a result, over time, Facebook will be able to build up a comprehensive database of where users have been, and with whom, from information they automatically give to the company. Emma Carr, deputy director of civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: 'This provides a stark warning about the loss of control experienced once you have installed an application to your mobile phone. 'Privacy is clearly at the very back of the Facebook's mind when creating an application that enables this kind of uploading of photographs to be easier when it, in fact, it should be made more difficult.' The Photo Sync feature, which was . launched on Friday with no public announcement from Facebook, is being . promoted by a banner at the top of the news feed of its mobile . applications. Once activated it allows the most recent pictures taken on users' smart phones to be background uploaded straight to a private album on Facebook's servers, where they will sit pending approval for publication. A Q&A on Facebook's help pages stresses that the album remains private, but experts say the social network will benefit from swathes of picture metadata that will enable it to find out unprecedented details about users' lives. At its most basic level it could enable them to tailor advertising by location. However, combined with Facebook's facial recognition technology it could also automatically find out who users have been socialising with and where. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg: Photo Sync . is set to provide his company with an avalanche of data it could use to build detailed pictures of users' lives . The same technology could also potentially be used for brand recognition, TechCrunch reported, allowing Facebook to even identify the types of trainers users are wearing and tailor adverts to suit. The automatic nature of the service also suggests that Facebook is set to gain access to users' most private photos, including some that may violate its notorious terms of service. TechCrunch writer John Constine said the service is essentially Facebook's entry into cloud storage. 'Facebook wants to help you share your life,' he wrote. 'You capture more angles and perspectives of your life through your camera than you might want to share. 'That means it can either make you decide what to upload and what to share, or eliminate the first decision, take care of that seamlessly in the background, and only ask you to choose what to publish.' Facebook mobile app users can activate the Photo Sync function by merely clicking 'Get Started' on a banner currently displayed at the top of the newsfeed. Once enabled, every picture taken on the device will be uploaded to the company's servers with no user interference or further approval needed. So far the Facebook allows for about 2GB of uploads, with users having to manually delete images to upload more once the limit has been reached. Facebook says it will 'generally try to sync your photos as soon as you take them', but the service also has a range of features to lessen its potential impact on users' phone bills and the battery life of their phones. 'When you're on a cellular network like 3G or 4G, we'll sync photos at a smaller size (around 100K each), so they're unlikely to use much of your data plan,' the company says, adding that larger versions will be synced if the device is connected to a WiFi network. Unlike Facebook's facial-recognition technology, which was recently banned in Europe, users will have to opt in to begin using Photo Sync. However, the potential remains that unsuspecting users will find a host of pictures uploaded to the Internet that had been intended for their eyes only. Internet security company Sophos warned: 'You are no longer in charge of what photos you upload to Facebook. 'In the past, you could decide what images you uploaded to the social network, and which pictures it could analyse for its own purposes. 'Now, all photos - good and bad - will be available to Facebook.' Big Brother Watch's Emma Carr added: 'This is yet another example of profit coming before privacy. If a company cares about the privacy of its customers it ensures that they are fully aware of how their information is being gathered and for what purposes. 'Companies that don't care act like Facebook.' MailOnline contacted Facebook's representatives for comment, but none were available.","Photo Sync being aggressively promoted to Facebook's mobile app users .

An Italian mayor has ditched the internet from council offices are discovering employees spent the working day trawling hardcore porn sites for up to six hours a day. Narcisio Buffoni, 60, was furious after an investigation uncovered that several of his staff were using their work computers to watch online filth. The investigation also uncovered other cyber-slacking activities, such as the excessive use of Facebook, but it was the extreme use of porn that angered Mr Buffoni, the centre left mayor of Montignoso near Massa Carrara in Tuscany. He has now ordered that all computers . have access to the web denied, with connections limited to the council's . internal system only. Mr Buffoni said: 'All I am prepared to say is that there has been an improper use of the Internet within the council offices - that's why there is no access to the web. 'I am not prepared to go into the details of what the sites visited were, other than to say they were not work-related and not ethical. It was restricted to a limited amount of staff, not all 74 employees.' According to reports in the Italian media, some of the employees would clock on at 8am and then spend as long as six hours surfing pornographic websites hardly doing any work and only stopping when the town hall building closed for lunch. It also emerged that the building's . wi-fi was not secure, so locals would gather outside the building to log . on and surf the web, also enjoying internet pornography. According to Italian meda, some workers were spending six hours a day perusing porn on the web. File picture . Despite the probe and crackdown, Mayor Buffoni, who has been in office for two years, has decided that he will take no disciplinary action against the council employees involved. The case does no favours for the . traditional view of many of Italian local government employees who have . long had a reputation for laziness and being work shy - with numerous attempts by central government in Rome to try and clean up their act. In 2008 then public administration . minister Renato Brunetta launched a clampdown which claimed to have . halved the number of sick days claimed by public employees by 50% although the initiative is said to only have had a short-term effect. The mayor has now ordered that all computers be disconnected from the internet, with connections limited to the Montignoso council's internal system .

Alleged Colorado theater gunman had the date of his deadly rampage marked with a 'special symbol' on the calendar and a backpack that included 'serial killer game' at his apartment, investigators have revealed. However, James Holmes' lawyers are arguing that evidence - and anything else seized at his Aurora home are admissible at trial because the initial search of the apartment was done without a warrant. If the defense team wins the argument, prosecutors will not be able to use much of the evidence that points to Holmes' motivations and planning of the shooting that killed 12 people and wounded nearly 60 others in July 2012. Insane? James Holmes' defense is claiming he was insane at the time of the trial and that his legal responsibility is limited . After the massacre at a midnight screening of 'The Dark Knight Rises' at the Century 16 multiplex in Aurora, Colorado, Holmes led police to believe that his apartment was rigged with explosives and ready to blow. They used a robot armed with a 12-gauge shotgun and a specialized shell to blast open the door. Inside, they found vats of chemicals rigged to explode. Defense lawyers have filed a motion that claims that search was illegal. Under the 'fruit from the poisonous tree' legal theory, all evidence obtained from the apartment would be not be allowed shown to a jury. That includes computer records that could point at Holmes' motive. Arapahoe County District Court Judge Carlos Samour Jr. said he would . issue written rulings on the suppression motions. A series of pretrial . hearings involving death penalty motions are scheduled for December. Detective Thomas Wilson testified Wednesday a page from a spiral notebook found in a backpack in Holmes' apartment contained a drawing that depicted 'a maze game ... a serial killer and a downtown Denver address.' He did not elaborate on the drawing. SWAT officers entered Holmes' apartment through a window following the shooting after discovering it ringed with explosives . Horror: A blood trail and Holmes' weapon can be seen outside a door of the Century 16 theater where 12 people were killed and nearly 60 wounded . He also had a Batman mask in his apartment. The disclosure came on the final day of a series of hearings on what evidence should be admissible in the onetime neuroscience graduate student's murder trial, scheduled to begin in early February. Holmes has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to the shooting and his lawyers have described their client as mentally ill and say he was psychotic when he went on the shooting spree. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty if he is convicted. Public defenders have filed a flurry of pleadings seeking to have nearly all the evidence amassed against Holmes precluded from trial. Defense lawyers said in court documents that they plan to file motions never 'litigated before in the state of Colorado' relating to capital punishment and mental illness. Holmes underwent a court-ordered sanity examination over the summer after he invoked the insanity defense. The results have not been publicly released.","James Holmes' legal team argues the initial search of his apartment after the shooting was illegal .

Yafet Askale, 28, was sentenced to a community order yesterday after being marked by a SmartWater anti-theft device in a booby-trapped car set up by police. He broke into the vehicle, which was left in Harlesden, northwest London, and was later found by police with items stolen from inside, including a laptop. Scroll down for video . Marked man: Yafet Askale, 28, was found guilty of theft from a motor vehicle after falling from a trap set in northwest London . Officers knew to hunt him down after the system automatically alerted them to the theft on June 10 this year, and ultra-violet scans showed that his face and jacket were heavily marked with the liquid. He pleaded not guilty before magistrates but was found guilty of theft from a motor vehicle, and sentenced to 49 hours of community work and £400 costs. SmartWater systems are currently on trial by Brent Police in the area, and have been used on vulnerable houses and cars in the area to deter thieves - and help catch them if they strike anyway. The devices can detect intruders, and spray them automatically with a fine mist of the substance, which is marked with a combination of chemicals that enables police to link people to a particular incident. Facing up to justice: He received 49 hours of community work, and had to pay £400 costs, for the theft, which saw him take items including a laptop computer . Invisible: SmartWater cannot be seen after it secretly marks clothing such as Askale's jacket . Revealed: But under UV light the impossible-to-remove liquid shows itself . The substances contained in SmartWater - which is odourless and invisible to the naked eye - are almost impossible to wash out of clothes, and can stay on the skin for weeks. Local people in Harlesden have been given free kits by police to mark their own valuables, which has led to a 40 percent reduction in street robbery and an 80 percent reduction in burglary. Detective Inspector Madeline Ryder said: 'This is another excellent example of the thorough work completed by Brent Officers. Using the trap car technology, we were able to charge Askale and put him before the courts. 'The trap car forms part of an overall crime reduction strategy designed by SmartWater, which is an effective weapon in the armoury of tools that we routinely use in Brent. We will continue to target those who are insistent on committing these types of offence.'

Medical insurance companies who speak ill of the Affordable Care Act are getting phone calls from the Obama administration warning them to be quiet, according to a new report. White House spokesman Jay Carney quickly called the report 'preposterous and inaccurate,' but a CNN report alleged Wednesday night that insurance executives 'are willing to listen to the White House because right now, it is the federal government that's [their] biggest customer.' And a prominent health insurance consultant said during the report that his clients have asked him to go public because they fear retaliation from the government that regulates their business. 'They feel defenseless before the White House P.R. team. The sources said they fear White House retribution,' CNN reporter Drew Griffin explained. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Investigative reporter Drew Griffin appeared Wednesday on two CNN shows with allegations that the Obama administration is putting the screws to anti-Obamacare insurance companies . Not so fast: President Barack Obama publicly defended his signature legislation Wednesday in Boston, even as his administration is reportedly working to silence its critics . 'Government backed plans accounted for about 48 percent of healthcare policies last year ... So basically, the insurance companies are in a position to just be quiet for fear of offending their biggest source of income.' 'The White House,' said Health Policy Strategy Associates chief Bob Laszewski, 'is exerting massive pressure on the industry, including the trade associations, to keep quiet.' Some of those business have publicly criticized the rollout of the Affordable Care Act anyway, and scoffed at the disastrous performance of its front-end website, healthcare.gov. Those public rebukes, Griffin said, bring a swift response from the Obama team. 'Basically, if you speak out, if you’re quoted, you’re going to get a call from the White House, pressure to be quiet,' he reported. Laszewski said some insurance companies warned the administration early on that the regulations imposed on them would lead to widespread policy cancellations since many of the plans already in force didn't comply with a laundry list of new requirements. 'I think the administrative mess you’re seeing right now,' he said, 'is indicative of what happens when somebody tries to run somebody else's business who thinks they’re smarter than you are.' The White House quickly denied the claim that it's warning insurers to stay quiet, calling the report 'preposterous and inaccurate' Under pressure: Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius withstood aggressive questioning in a congressional hearing Wednesday, defending the Obamacare plan against charges that it was causing millions to lose the health insurance plans they chose . The White House has taken flak in the past week as news emerged that insurance companies have already cancelled at least 2 million plans bought on the individual market. Obama had promised for years that Americans who wanted to keep their existing insurance would be allowed to keep it. But an intensely restrictive set of requirements has squeezed most of those policies out of such 'grandfather' status, leaving policyholders at the mercy of government-run exchanges – whose biggest website has been chronically out of service since its Oct. 1 launch. A change to a policy as minor as a tweaked copay schedule or an increased premium will render it ineligible for that 'grandfathered' status in the future. Estimates of the number of consumers affected by those cancellations have ranged as high as 20 million. Marilyn Tavenner, the Medicare and Medicaid administrator who was in charge of the website effort, testified in a congressional hearing Tuesday that Obamacare isn't to blame for the zeroed-out policies. Health Policy Strategy Associates chief Bob Laszewski told Anderson Cooper that 'the administrative mess you're seeing right now is indicative of what happens when somebody tries to run somebody else's business' Not our fault: Marilyn Tavenner, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said Tuesday on Capitol Hill that Obamacare was designed to move people from lousy health care plans to better ones . 'Half of the people in the individual market prior to 2010 didn't stay on their policies,' Tavenner claimed. 'They were either kicked off for pre-existing conditions, they saw their premiums go up at least 20 percent a year, and there were no protections for them. And sometimes they were in plans that they thought were fine until they actually needed hospitalization, and they found out it didn't cover hospitalization or it didn't cover cancer.' HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, too, defended the insurance-company cancellations when she had her turn on the congressional hot seat Wednesday. Obamacare's uniform minimum standards, she claimed, 'will finally provide the kind of protections we all enjoy in our health care plans. Individuals who buy insurance on their own have never had that kind of health security.' That protection comes at a price, however, as millions of Americans have found their rates will increase under the Affordable Care Act, including for the young people the White House desperately needs to attract. A spokesman for Obama told reporters yesterday that 'the president has complete confidence in Secretary Sebelius.' Obama, however, has plunged to an all-time low approval rating, with just 42 per cent of Americans giving his job performance a thumbs-up.","CNN reports that insurance executives who speak out against the Affordable Care Act are getting unpleasant White House phone calls .

The former Prime Minister has criticised the British government's lack of action and failure to intervene in the war-torn country.

The dramatic moment two state troopers saved the life of a disabled 13-year-old who was choking on a chicken nugget has been captured on dash cam video. New Jersey troopers Ruben Benavidez and James Hearne were driving through Trenton on Sunday afternoon when they came across the frantic Estrada family on the roadside struggling to help their son, Julian, breathe after he started choking. The family waved down the troopers and the two men are seen in the tape pulling up behind their car on Route 129 and then successfully dislodging the nugget, saving the 13-year-old's life. Scroll down for video . Heroes: The dramatic moment two state troopers saved the life of a disabled teen who was choking on a chicken nugget has been captured on dash cam video . Julian's mother, Maricruz Estrada, said she first noticed her son, who was born with hydrocephalus or 'water on the brain', gasping for air while they were driving on the highway. 'Right away I look at him and I see that he was choking, so my husband pulled over right away,' she told CBS News. The parents tried to clear the teen's throat but weren't having much success. That's when the troopers came to the rescue. Emergency: The Estrada family, pictured, waved down the troopers on Route 129 on Sunday afternoon and the troopers are seen in the tape pulling up behind the family's car . Teamwork: Trooper Hearne, center, performed the Heimlich manouver on Julian to dislodge the nugget while Trooper Benavidez, left controlled traffic, spoke with dispatch and helped calm down the Estradas in Spanish . 'When I ran up there, I get behind him, started the Heimlich,' Trooper Hearne said of the lifesaving maneuver. Meanwhile, Trooper Benavidez, who had only been on the job two weeks, controlled traffic, spoke with dispatch and helped calm down the Estradas in Spanish. 'She was just yelling and screaming in Spanish like any mom would, and try ripping a mom off her young son that's chocking, that's not easy to do,' Trooper Benavidez told the network. Angels: The Estradas have labeled troopers Ruben Benavidez, left, and James Hearne, right, their guardian angels, believing that their son would have choked to death if they hadn't arrived when they did . Appreciative: Julian, left, who has was born with hydrocephalus, and his mother thanked the troopers for what they did . Because of his disability, Julian can't stand, forcing Trooper Hearne to hold him up off the ground while performing the Heimlich. 'The feel of it was completely different and Julian's situation is unique, but when it comes down to it, it's the same technique,' Trooper Hearne said. The Estradas have labeled the troopers their guardian angels, believing that their son would have choked to death if they hadn't arrived when they did. 'When the troopers come we feel that we see angels coming,' Maricruz Estrada said.","New Jersey troopers Ruben Benavidez and James Hearne were driving through Trenton when they came across the frantic Estrada family on the roadside on Sunday .

Many of us have taken a tumble after drinking one too many but its likely these revellers were left with a more sore head than most. From an 'endless' fall down an escalator at Leeds to a man tumbling onto the tracks when he tried to kick a pigeon in Edinburgh, Network Rail has released CCTV of some of the most dangerous antics across its stations. In one terrifying clip, a drunken passenger can be seen leaning against a moving train as it pulls into Manchester Piccadilly Station before falling underneath a carriage on to the rails. The man luckily missed the train wheels and survived the fall. See the CCTV below... Ongoing fall: A male passenger can be seen repeatedly rolling down an escalator, which is travelling upwards, in Leeds as a woman tries to walk down to reach him . Help at hand: Apparently completely unable to pick himself up, a crowd gathers at the bottom of the escalator at Leeds station to help him up . Network Rail (NR) has released the shocking footage as part of a new safety campaign to make passengers aware of the dangers of travelling after a heavy night of drinking. It comes after more than 1,600 people have been hurt in slips, trips and falls at the 17 stations run by NR in the last year - with many of the incidents occurring after bouts of evening drinking. Falls by passengers have been most prevalent at Leeds station and at the London stations of Paddington and Liverpool Street. Incidents in the last year have included one death, 51 bone fractures, 19 dislocations, five concussions and dozens of bruises, cuts and abrasions as people have fallen on steps and escalators, over luggage and even off platforms between trains. Run up: A young man wearing a kilt can be seen running towards a pigeon as he prepares to kick it at Edinburgh Waverley station shortly after 10pm . Dangerous: But the pigeon flies away at the last moment - leaving the man teetering on the edge of the platform . On the rails: The man loses his balance and plunges on to the platform behind a stationary train. His friend decides to leave him and nonchalantly walks off . NR's network operations managing director Robin Gisby said: 'We do everything we can to make moving around our stations as easy and safe as possible but our teams deal with far too many people who have injured themselves where it appears alcohol has been a factor.' British Transport Police Deputy Chief Constable Paul Crowther said: 'Somewhat inevitably, drinking alcohol can impair people's judgment and co-ordination. 'Encouraging passengers to be more aware of their surroundings, particularly when they have had a drink, and to be alert to the inherent dangers that exist in stations will, we hope, reduce avoidable slips and falls across the network.' The safety campaign includes posters at the 17 stations and a video placed on YouTube and on screen in stations. Wobbly: A young man unsteady on his feet in the background starts to lean against a moving train as it comes in to a platform at Manchester Piccadilly Station . Terrifying: The man in the background then stumbles - falling underneath the moving train . Lucky: The man completely disappears from view underneath the train which quickly comes to a halt.

Gone are the days when busy users had to choose between following their Twitter feeds and watching their favorite TV shows – now they will be able to do both simultaneously. Twitter and Comcast have signed a partnership that will let viewers access TV shows using a new remote control feature and buy movie tickets directly from a tweet, deepening the short messaging service’s ties to television programming. The two companies announced today that a new feature that is part of the deal will let customers of Comcast’s Xfinify TV service tune in to programs by clicking a ‘See It’ button in a tweet. The button will begin appearing in tweets next month. Clicker of tomorrow: Twitter and Comcast . teamed up to create the 'See It' button that will be appearing in tweets . about shows and allowing users to tune in live or set a DVR recording . The feature enables viewers to tune in to a live or On Demand show like Sunday Night Football or the hit reality show ‘The Voice’ through their set-top box or mobile device. In a statement, Comcast CEO Brian Roberts called it ‘an instant online remote control.’ The button will allow Twitter users who are also Comcast customers to set recordings on their DVRs, tune in to shows like The Voice online, on TV or on mobile devices directly through a tweet. Twitter users who do not subscribe to Comcast will be redirected to NBC's website or app to watch  shows there. They can also purchase mobile movie tickets through Fandango. Partners: Comcast CEO Brian Roberts (right) called the innovation 'an instant online remote control,' which according to Twitter CEO Dick Costolo (left), will allow users to tune in directly from a tweet . Join the club: The 'See It' feature will be available to customers of Comcast's Xfinify TV service; other Twitter users will be redirected to NBC's website . In the current TV season, shows on NBC, USA, Bravo, MSNBC and other networks will be accessible through the ‘See It’ button. Comcast and Twitter said they are in talks with other TV networks and companies that will use the feature in the coming months. The hope is the ‘See It’ button will become as ubiquitous as the Facebook ‘like.’ Media companies will also have a better sense of how to target Twitter efforts since they will be armed with aggregate data of people watching programs. ‘We will know how many of those tweets generate consumption back on TV,’ said Sam Schwartz, Comcast chief business development officer. Twitter’s deal with the nation’s . largest cable company comes as the social media giant prepares for an . IPO of stock, which could occur as soon as next month. The . 140-character messaging platform is setting its sights on grabbing a . piece of the TV advertising market - the first stop for brands that . spend billions of dollars a year for TV commercials. The . agreement is more expansive than the advertising partnerships Twitter . has signed recently with TV content providers such as CBS and the NFL. But it does have an advertising component, which adds NBCUniversal’s . properties to Twitter’s Amplify program. Tweet flicks: Twitter users also will be able to buy mobile movie tickets through Fandango . Amplify lets TV content owners beam real-time video clips to Twitter users who may have seen —or could be interested in — their programming. It also allows marketers to communicate with viewers who saw their TV ads, extending commercial pitches to consumers’ smartphones and tablets. ‘Twitter is where television viewers come to talk about what they’re watching on TV when they’re watching it,’ Dick Costolo, Twitter’s CEO, said in a statement. ‘Millions of users are exposed to the live conversation that unfolds on Twitter while a show is on the air and now, with See It, they’ll be able to tune in directly from a Tweet.’","'See It' button allowing customers of Comcast's Xfinity TV service will begin appearing in tweets in November .

She made her debut on TV hit Homeland on Sunday night - playing a new Muslim CIA analyst tasked with tracking down terrorists by gruff boss Saul Berenson. But Nazanin Boniadi has already been on a 'mission' of her own after it was alleged she was vetted to become Tom Cruise's girlfriend by Scientology chiefs - and told she was 'going to save the world'. The stunning 31-year-old actress plays rookie analyst Fara in the Showtime series, but she hit the headlines last year after Vanity Fair reported that Nazanin was secretly chosen to date A list star Tom, 51, before he married Katie Holmes - and the pair enjoyed a brief romance. Vetted: New Homeland star Nazanin Boniadi was at the center of allegations that she had been vetted by Scientologists to become Tom Cruise's girlfriend . Co-stars: Nazanin plays Fara, a new Muslim CIA analyst, berated by CIA boss Saul Berenson, played by Mandy Patinkin . Maureen . Orth, a special correspondent for Vanity Fair, last year claimed in a bombshell article that  Scientology . officials auditioned 'dozen of young women' for Tom Cruise prior to his . marriage to Katie in 2009. And she alleged that Iranian-born, London-raised Nazanin 'was told she was being chosen for a mission' and was 'really going to save the world'. Maureen also claimed that Nazanin did not know what was in store for her - or that she would end up meeting Cruise. The claims were strenuously denied by the Church of Scientology at the time. However, the writer told Good Morning America in September 2012: '[She] was told that she was being chosen for a mission, that was really . going to save the world. That she was going to be meeting . dignitaries, that it was very important that she look good, and be . worldly.' She went on: 'And she had no idea, when it began, that [she] was going to end . up meeting Tom Cruise.' Nazanin has appeared on TV in a number of series including comedy How I Met Your Mother, but her appearance on Homeland could prove to be her biggest role yet. Millions watched as the slight brunette made her debut as Fara, a young Persian transactions analyst brought in to help Saul trace the Langley bombing operation's funding and its origins. She was left in tears as Saul chided her for not working hard enough and pointing out to her headscarf, raged: 'That thing you're wearing on your head... is . one big 'f**k you' to the people you work with,"" he tells her. ""Give me . a goddamn plan or don't say anything.' But Fara retaliated by bringing in the bankers suspected of illegally partnering with an Iranianin trading company - before discovering that the usual banking fees removed from wire transfers had simply disappeared. A total of $45 million had gone to an unknown individual, and Saul suspected finding that money will lead in the right direction.

Scoot: Katie Holmes teaches seven-year-old daughter Suri how to ride her scooter to school in Manhattan on Monday . Vanity Fair published its feature on Cruise just months his third wife, actress Katie Holmes, blindsided him by filing for divorce in June 2012. Among its claims were that the Mission Impossible star knew that Scientology chiefs were vetting potential love interests for him before he started dating Katie, 34, in 2005. In the article, Orth claimed that a project to identify a new partner for Cruise, following . the break-up of his relationships with Nicole Kidman and Penelope Cruz, . started in 2004 and was headed by Shelly Miscavige, wife of the . church's top official David Miscavige. Speaking about the vetting process, she said: 'I do believe that [Cruise] was very . much aware that it was going on, or at least he had certainly heard . about her, because by the time he met her he did know all about her.' Former official Marc Headley, interviewed in the Vanity Fair piece, claimed that a number of Scientologist actresses were interviewed by church leaders and told they were being considered for a role in a new training video. Controversial cover story: The October 2012 issue of Vanity Fair . However, they were allegedly faced with unexpected questions such as: 'What do you think of Tom Cruise?' Katie . Holmes, who did not become a Scientologist until she started going out . with Cruise, was not part of this process, the article said. Instead, . Mrs Miscavige allegedly chose Nazanin Boniadi, then 24, to be the megastar's new . partner. The reports went on to claim she was told she had been selected for 'a very . important mission', and ordered to break up with her boyfriend. When Nazanin was flown to New York and taken for dinner by Cruise at . trendy restaurant Nobu, she began to suspect she was part of an . elaborate set-up, Orth wrote. The . pair went ice-skating at Rockefeller Center, where the rink had been . closed for them, then spent the night together, it was alleged. The actress, who has . appeared in General Hospital blockbuster Iron . Man, was also made to sign multiple confidentiality agreements over her . relationship with Cruise, Vanity Fair claimed. Her . relationship with the star remained a secret, and the couple were together from November 2004 until January 2005, during which time Nazanin allegedly lived with Cruise. However, she found herself out of favour with Cruise after unintentionally insulting . church leader Miscavige by saying ""Excuse me?"" and asking him to repeat himself more . than once, apparently an indication in Scientology that one is not a . good communicator or listener. After their relationship ended, Nazanin was allegedly sent away to the Scientology facilities in Clearwater, Florida, where she was forced to clean toilets with a toothbrush, scrub bathroom tiles with acid and dig ditches in the middle of the night. All the allegations were denied by the Church of Scientology. However, former Scientologist, director Paul Haggis stated that this was true - and said Nazanin had quit the church in 2010 after 'several years of trying to handle this injustice internally, to no avail'. And in December 2012, Nazanin released a rap song that made it clear she was no longer associated with Scientology, rapping: 'But we all know how it is/This ain't no road to freedomIt's a blind alley, like Kirstie Alley/Travolta, and Cruise, but we ain't no fools' Just . a few months after the break-up, Cruise started dating former Dawson's Creek star Katie, . who converted to Scientology ahead of their marriage in November 2006. The couple went on to marry in Rome in November 2006 following the birth of their daughter Suri in April 2006. Katie filed for divorce in June 2012 and the split was finalised two weeks later.

Fighter: Lauren Kavanaugh, 20, has spoken out 12 years after she was found in a closet . Twelve years after Lauren Kavanaugh was found emaciated and imprisoned in a tiny urine-soaked closet, she has revealed her extraordinary strength. Speaking to the Dallas Morning News in a series of powerful interviews, the now-20-year-old shared how she has struggled to gain control of her life after suffering six years of sexual, emotional and physical abuse at the hands of her mother and stepfather, Barbara and Kenneth Atkinson. 'I'm hoping one day I'll be able to have a normal life,' Lauren, who now lives in Canton, Texas with her adoptive mother, told writer Scott Farwell. 'Of course, my life hasn't ever been normal.' Lauren was nearly two when the courts ordered her adoptive parents, Bill and Sabrina Kavanaugh, to hand her back to her biological mother, Barbara Atkinson. Atkinson, then Barbara Calhoun, had . given up Lauren at birth but eight months later the Kavanaughs received a . call that she had changed her mind and wanted the little girl back. During . the adoption process, their lawyer had mistakenly never filed the paperwork to . terminate Atkinson's parental rights and they lost on the technicality, . sending the little girl back to her mother. In . the following six years, Lauren endured sickening abuse at the hands of . the couple, who starved, confined and allegedly raped her and handed . her over to other men to sexually abuse. When . she was found in 2001, she weighed just 25.6 pounds, the size of an average . two-year-old. She was potbellied with malnutrition and doctors had to . use a feeding method devised for Holocaust victims. Scroll down for video . Tortured: Lauren, who was 8 when she was found in 2001, weighed the same as a two-year-old. She is pictured in the hospital shortly after she was admitted; staff said it was the worst abuse case they'd seen . Malnourished: She had been so deprived of nutrition that her bloated stomach lacked the enzymes it needed to digest food and doctors had to feed her using a method used on Holocaust victims . Investigators said she also suffered years of sexual abuse - leaving her tiny body so badly damaged that she needed a series of reconstructive surgeries - but because it would be too traumatic for the then-eight-year-old to testify, they were never convicted of rape. They did however both receive life sentences for felony injury to a child and will be eligible for parole in 2031, when Lauren is 38. 'I never loved Lauren. I never wanted . her,' Barbara Atkinson told investigators after she was charged. 'When my other kids hurt, I hurt. When . Lauren hurt, I felt nothing.' Atkinson . had a total of six children - with four different men - but it was only . Lauren who was singled out for the abuse. Kenneth later told police she . had simply explained the girl was 'bad'. For . months before Lauren was found, she was locked in a closet that measured . four feet wide and nine feet deep while she heard her siblings play and run around outside. When . she was found, investigators noted that her legs were red raw from . sitting in her urine and feces, and she had traces of feces in her . mouth. She had been so deprived of nutrition that her bloated stomach . lacked the enzymes it needed to digest food. Arrested: Barbara Atkinson, left, and her stepfather Kenneth Ray Atkinson, right, were both sentenced to life in prison and will be eligible for parole in 2031 . Disgusting: Lauren was kept in this four-foot wide closet for months before she was removed . Desperation: The doorknob had scratches on it where Lauren had tried to get out after being locked inside. From behind the closed door she could hear her five other siblings playing and eating . But . as well as physical impairments, she was deprived of stimulation that . resulted in brain atrophy, and she missed lessons on emotional development, . such as how to trust and give affection. She did not know how to sit in a chair . or use the bathroom. When she was taken outside during her hospital . stay, she screamed when she stepped on the grass because she had never . felt it before. But . authorities found her large vocabulary curious - and later found out . that she had learned how to speak from the country music her mother . constantly played to drown out her cries. Lauren's filthy living conditions were . found when her stepfather invited a neighbor inside to show her the . little girl locked inside the closet. Authorities suggested this was an act of revenge after his . wife started meeting men on the internet and taking off for days at a . time. Fingers have since been pointed in numerous directions as people search for who to blame. Relatives . said they bought Atkinson's explanation that Lauren had an eating . disorder as she would gorge when she came to their houses. When they . visited Atkinson's home, she always said the little girl was at a . friend's house. Prison: Authorities found the closet soaked with urine and feces. She had bitten wood from the door . Sick: The filthy conditions were found when Kenneth brought a neighbor to the home and opened the closet door. Authorities said it could have been out of revenge as his wife was reportedly having affairs . The . couple's other children said they knew the abuse was going on and would . sometime sneak her food but that they, too, were terrified of their . mother and scared of raising the alarm. Child Protective . Services had also been called to the house when neighbors saw the . children eating food from the trash - but the parents made Lauren say she was . fine and claimed to be neighbors. Kim . Higgins, a CPS caseworker, told the Morning News: 'There was never a . time we went out and saw the kids and saw the home and talked to them . and failed to do something. The failure was really on everyone else in . these kids' lives.' Despite . the extreme trauma, police officers, firefighters and doctors all . commented on Lauren's unwavering positive spirit after she was found. But . still, there was struggles; she ate her meals on a tiny picnic table in . the hallway of the hospital because she was worried someone would take . her food. She eventually returned to the Kavanaughs' home, where again, they were met with the unexpected. She . would sleep in her closet and gorge on food in the night, so they took . off her closet doors and left out cookies and pink lemonade on the . kitchen table. New home: She went to live with Sabrina Kavanaugh, pictured, and her husband - the couple who had originally adopted her as a baby before she was ordered to be given back due to a legal technicality . She cried . when she saw a family put suitcases into a trunk because she was often . locked in the trunk as her former family drove around to collect food, while she lay starving in the back. Sadly, . escaping the Atkinsons was not the end of the abuse; in 2005, case . workers encouraged her adoptive mother to relax her tight rein on her . daughter and Lauren went to stay with Sabrina Kavanaugh's niece, her . husband and their sons. The following morning, the husband took her outside . and sexually assaulted her. He was later jailed for the attack. She . has since endured fits of rage, fights at school, self-harming suicide . attempts, and seizures when her body sought to block out the painful . memories, particularly of the rapes. But . she said a fight at school was a turning point because she was put in . an alternative school and residential therapy, where she met other abuse . survivors and learned she . was not alone. 'There were a lot of tough years in . there,' Sabrina Kavanaugh, whose husband Bill died in 2003, told the Morning News. 'Sometimes . I wasn’t sure we were going to make it. But all things considered, . Lauren's doing great. I think we may have turned a corner.' Perp walk: Barbara Atkinson told family that her daughter gorged at their homes as she had an eating disorder . Cruel: Barbara Atkinson, pictured in January 2002, said: 'I never loved Lauren. I never wanted her' Lauren graduated from high school this year and has enrolled at Trinity Valley Community College in Athens. She is no longer taking medication for depression or bipolar disorder.

A petrol station owner has been sentenced to four years and seven months in jail after going on the run when a bank error mistakenly transferred £3.4 million into his account. Dubbed the ‘accidental millionaire’, Hui ‘Leo’ Gao, 32, triggered an international manhunt after he fled New Zealand with his girlfriend Kara Hurring, transferring the mistaken money into overseas bank accounts and spending it abroad. Hurring, 33, was sentenced to nine months of home detention for her role in the crime which was ‘significantly less’ and because she needed to look after the couple’s two children. 'Accidental millionaire': Hui 'Leo' Gao went on the run after transferring £3.4 million into overseas bank accounts when a bank error gave him access to the money . Gao’s lawyer Ron Mansfield said his client could not resist the temptation of such a large amount of money. He said: ‘Your Honour, some say the greatest temptation was faced by Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden but these are modern times for a man trying to keep the doors of his small business open, $10 million (£5.13 million) placed in his bank account was a very great temptation.’ Mr Mansfield also said his client had no premeditation and had not used any fraudulent means to steal the money. The offence started when Australian bank Westpac accidentally gave Gao access to £5.1 million when he applied for overdraft financing for his business which he owned with his mother in Rotorua, New Zealand. The bank approved his overdraft application with a £51,300 limit but a clerical error gave him access to 100 times the intended amount in April 2009. On discovering the error, Gao was overheard by a flatmate yelling ‘f***ing rich...I've got $1 million’, according to court documents. Home detention: Girlfriend Kara Hurring, pictured in court with Gao, was sentenced to nine months home detention for her 'lesser' role in the crime so she can look after the couple's children . Within a month the couple withdrew £3.4 million from Gao’s bank account and transferred it to bank accounts in Hong Kong and China. Gao also transferred more than £178,000 to casino accounts in gambling hub Macau in China. Hurring also opened a ‘player’s account’ and £1.19 million was transferred to another account in the name of Gao’s father, Alex Wang. He then fled to Hong Kong and Hurring followed a few days later but by early May the bank became aware of the error and alert authorities who issued an Interpol alert for the missing couple. On the run for more than two years, Gao was finally arrested in Hong Kong in September 2011 and extradited to New Zealand where he pleaded guilty to seven charges of theft. Hurring was arrested in February 2011 when she returned to New Zealand to renew her six-year-old daughter’s passport according to TV NZ. She was found guilty of 25 counts of theft and three counts of attempting to dishonestly use documents and two counts of money laundering. Westpac has recovered about £1.5 million from the couple’s New Zealand account but is yet to recoup the remaining money, said to be in the millions.","Hui 'Leo' Gao spent millions of dollars from his account after a bank error gave him £3.4m .

The fish rider soon jumps in next to the fish, it barely flinched. 'They started as strangers but ended up as good friends,' according to the video's description.

Because of this, the rider suffered barnacle burn, according to the video's description. As the ride came to an end, the Mola’s rider thanked it for the trip by scrubbing some of the barnacles off, according to the video’s description.

Brownlow, Jr., 36, is accused of killing five people during a series of attacks hours earlier in his rural North Texas community of Terrell . A Texas man accused of shooting dead five people, including his mother and aunt, was captured on a surveillance video entering a Mexican restaurant in the middle of his drug-fueled rampage. Charles Brownlow Jr. was arrested at about 1.30am Tuesday after running into the woods following a high-speed chase, authorities said. Terrell police Chief Jody Lay identified the victims of the North Texas shooting spree as Brownlow's mother, Mary Brownlow, 61; his aunt, Belinda Walker, 55; Jason Michael Wooden, 33; Kelleye Lynnette Sluder, 30; and Luis Gerardo Leal-Carrillo, 22. At 9.47pm, after Brownlow had allegedly killed his mother and aunt, he was seen walking into Dos Aces Mexican restaurant on U.S. 80. The footage from the eatery obtained by NBC DFW shows a hostess escorting the suspect dressed in a sports jersey with No. 32 across the front to a table. After exchanging a few inaudible words with the staffer, Brownlow walked out after refusing to order food or even sit down. Manager Eric Fragoso told the NBC station that had Brownlow decided to open fire on his way out, the rampage would have claimed much more victims because the restaurant was packed with dinner crowd at the time.

Brownlow, 36, was being held on one preliminary count each of capital murder and evading arrest, although additional charges were expected. ‘We're all in a state of shock,’ Lay said at a news conference hours after Brownlow's arrest. ‘You have a tendency to think, “How can that happen here?” This is a country community, a rural community, people are real close. This is going to be, it's going to have a really big impact on us.’ Police would not give a motive for the shooting spree, but they believe that the suspected gunman may have been high on drugs. Brownlow's brother, Terrence Walker, said Brownlow struggled with addiction and ‘always wanted to take something that wasn't his.’ He said Brownlow had been living at their mother's home and that she continued to look after him. ‘I was hoping my mom would open her eyes and realize that she needed to let him grow up, put him out,’ said Walker. var nbcLP={};nbcLP.aRandomNumber=Math.floor(Math.random()*10000);nbcLP.currentPageLoc=encodeURIComponent(window.location.href);nbcLP.currentSiteLoc=encodeURIComponent(window.location.host);nbcLP.defaultWidth=636;nbcLP.defaultHeight=358;nbcLP.cmsID=""229808701"";nbcLP.vidPid=""oh_WdlpopqtV"";nbcLP.vidSec=""TK"";nbcLP.vidSubSec=""TK"";nbcLP.vidFrame=document.getElementById(""nbcLP229808701"");nbcLP.vidFrame.style.border=""none"";nbcLP.vidFrame.width=nbcLP.defaultWidth;nbcLP.vidFrame.height=nbcLP.defaultHeight;nbcLP.vidFrame.scrolling=""no"";nbcLP.vidFrame.src=""http://www.nbcdfw.com/templates/nbc_partner_player?cmsID=""+nbcLP.cmsID+""&videoID=""+nbcLP.vidPid+""&width=""+nbcLP.defaultWidth+""&height=""+nbcLP.defaultHeight+""&sec=""+nbcLP.vidSec+""&subsec=""+nbcLP.vidSubSec+""&turl=""+nbcLP.currentSiteLoc+""&ourl=""+nbcLP.currentPageLoc+""&rand=""+nbcLP.aRandomNumber; .

Heartbreaking loss: Terrence Walker of Forney, Texas, the brother of 36-year-old Charles Everett Brownlow Jr., stands in front of their mother, Mary Brownlow's house as a law enforcement officer takes down crime scene tape . Brownlow's criminal record dates back to 1995 and includes convictions for drug possession, burglary and assaulting a family member in 2011. Records indicate Brownlow was accused of striking a woman he had a relationship with. In 2009, he was sentenced to three years in prison for being a felon in possession of a firearm, and was paroled after seven months. The attacks began around 5pm at the home of Belinda and Robert Walker. He said he arrived home to find his wife lying on the floor of his 15-year-old son's room. ‘I just went in calling my wife's name and she never did answer,’ Robert Walker said. About 30 minutes later, fire units responded to a blaze at Mary Brownlow's house a few blocks away. When the fire was extinguished, crews found her body in the smoldering wreckage. Lay said it was clearly arson. Crime scene: The home of Robert and Belinda Walker, in Terrell, Texas, where the woman was found dead .

Community response: People gather at Ben Gill Park's flag pole in Terrell, Texas on Tuesday evening to pray for the family and friends of the five people killed in Monday's shootings . At about 10.30pm, police responded to a report of a shooting at another home and found Wooden and Sluder dead. A 3-year-old boy in the home was unharmed and was released to relatives. Tesla Savell, who lives across the street from the home where the two bodies were found, said worried friends sent her text messages as the slayings continued Monday night. ‘It hits close to home,’ Savell said of the killings of the couple, whom she described as a ‘sweet family.’By this point, authorities had a description of the stolen vehicle Charles Brownlow was believed to be driving. An off-duty police officer saw that vehicle parked outside a convenience store at 10.37pm. As the officer called in the sighting, the suspect ran from the store, jumped in the vehicle and sped away, Lay said. A high-speed police chase ensued. Charles Brownlow wrecked the car and took off on foot into thick woods, dropping a holster or handgun on the way, the chief said. Troubled: Terrence Walker said his brother struggled with drug addiction and 'always wanted to take something that wasn't his' Career criminal: Brownlow's record dates back to 1995 and includes convictions for drug possession, burglary and assaulting a family member in 2011. A police helicopter and dogs were summoned to assist in the manhunt, and Brownlow was found hiding in a creek. Lay said Brownlow appeared to be intoxicated ""on some sort of substance"" when he was arrested. The fifth victim, Leal-Carrillo, was a clerk at the convenience store. The store's owner, Ali Karimi, said he was a model employee and a ""beautiful young man"" who had a 1-year-old son.","Charles Brownlow Jr, 36, stopped by Dos Aces Mexican eatery on U.S. 80 after allegedly killing his aunt and mother .

A female Royal Navy Royal Navy officer killed herself after her boss called her ‘sweetheart’, an inquest heard yesterday. Lieutenant Sara Hellawell, 26, took an overdose in her locked cabin on board HMS Edinburgh. The ‘feisty’ marine engineer had become upset with line manager Lieutenant Commander Philip Boakes when they had a cigarette together on the deck of the Type 42 destroyer. In a statement, Lt Cdr Boakes said: ‘We had a discussion about how some people had not showed themselves in the best light on a sun downs (a break on land) and maybe they should be cancelled. ‘Later Sara appeared to be  distressed. I asked her what was the matter and she said it was her mum. I said if she wanted to go home  it could be arranged, but she  said “No”. ‘I said “Listen, sweetheart” which I meant to be a term of endearment, but she said it was condescending.’ Lt Hellawell stormed off the deck and was found dead at 8am on June 16 after crewmate Helen Wright forced open her locked cabin door. A post-mortem examination revealed Lt Hellawell, who grew up Ampthill, Bedfordshire, died from drug toxicity caused by amitriptyline, an anti-depressant used to treat irritable bowel syndrome, and codeine, a painkiller. Family: Left, Sara's sister Anna Hellawell and mother Sandra Hellawell arrive at the inquest, and right the victim's uncle Peter Tubberdy who criticised the Navy . Lt Hellawell had been given a . six-month supply of medication before HMS Edinburgh set sail on a . seven-month deployment from Portsmouth on May 25. The vessel was taking part in an anti-piracy operation off the coast of Angola before travelling on to the Falkland Islands. Dunstable Coroner’s Court heard there . was nothing in Lt Hellawell’s medical history to suggest she was . suffering from depression. Feisty: Sara Elizabeth Hellawell was said to have been offended by her boss's comment . Lieutenant Commander Tony Day, who . conducted the Royal Navy Police investigation, told the inquest: ‘No . specific factor has been determined as the catalyst for this tragic . event.’ But he added: ‘She placed high demands on herself and worried how she appeared to others.’ Bedfordshire coroner David Morris . said Lt Hellawell’s grieving family believed calling her ‘sweetheart’ would have been ‘like a red rag to a bull’. He said: ‘Sara was sometimes feisty and perhaps if things  didn’t quite go her way she would get angry. ‘What made her mad was calling her “sweetheart” in her own mind. ‘She was obviously a highly able officer and wanted to be respected at her level and irrespective of the fact she was a woman.’ In a statement her uncle, Peter . Tubberdy, said that some of the officer’s personal belongings had been . destroyed or not yet returned. Mr Morris said he ‘shared concerns’ that some of Lt Hellawell’s bags had been removed from her cabin after her death. ‘Nothing was completely itemised, . which is what you would expect in a criminal investigation or on shore,’ he said. ‘Lessons may be learned.’ The coroner recorded a verdict  of suicide.","Inquest heard 'feisty' Sara had .

Aqab Hussain was jailed for 20 years after running over a group of friends, including a father of three who is no longer able to talk or walk . A disqualified driver who bowled over three pedestrians in a revenge attack has been jailed for 20 years. Aqab Hussain, 21, was already banned from the roads when he ploughed into a group of friends following a minor spat outside a club. Shocking CCTV footage shows the attack, which during the trial was compared to a scene from the computer game Grant Theft Auto, taking place in Manchester city centre last August. It shows one man knocked to the pavement, another catapulted over the roof of the Vauxhall Corsa and a third carried down the street before Hussain swerved to dislodge him from the bonnet. Father-of-three Michael Ward, 29, who was thrown over the car roof, was left with catastrophic head injuries. He now cannot talk, feed himself or play any part in family life, Manchester Crown Court heard. Mr Ward was already partially sighted and had to be helped to cross roads and get upstairs before he was injured in the incident. Hussain denied being the driver but was found guilty by a jury of four counts of attempted murder after a trial last month and today given a 20-year jail term. He had flouted court orders for previous convictions for dangerous driving and Hussain, himself a father of three, was serving a ban at the time of the offence. Passing sentence Judge Robert Atherton said it was fortunate Mr Ward did not die in the attack. ‘He was very, very seriously injured. He will never recover, he will never be able to enjoy his family,’ the judge said. ‘One witness described the scene as being like someone bowling at skittles and people being flung like skittles to the side. ‘Why you did it is extremely difficult to understand.’ Scroll down for video . Approach: The friends - one of them partially blind - were crossing the road after a night out in Manchester . Hussain ploughed into a group of friends following a minor spat outside a club . During the trial, eyewitness Corey Gordon, 26, who watched the attack from inside his car, later compared it to a sequence from the violent computer game series in which users play the role of car thieves. He said: ‘It was like ten pin bowling where you hit the skittles and they go up in the air. I can only describe it as unreal - a computer game like Grand Theft Auto - as he swerved off line to hit the men. It knocked one of the men at least 7ft into the air.’ Hussain even wobbled his vehicle so he could shake off one of the men who was still on the bonnet, Manchester Crown Court was told. Outside court, Mr Ward’s wife of seven years, Mary Rose Ward, said: ‘What he did to my husband, you wouldn’t do it to an animal really would you? ‘My husband was never a violent person and I am not a violent person but he should not have done what he did.’ Mowed down: Hussain's silver Corsa emerged from a side road, turning the wrong way then sped up to 40mph . Awful: Mr Ward was carried on the bonnet for several feet as the driver swerved to throw him into the road . Mrs Ward said her blind husband was still receiving full-time care in a rehabilitation centre but that she cares for him during the day before going home to look after their children, daughters Montana, six, and Crystal, aged four, and son Michael, aged one. ‘He can’t play with the kids or anything. He can’t talk, he can’t walk, he can’t wash himself or feed himself, he has no memory. I’m his wife and I will care for him for the rest of my life because he is my husband. ‘He knows he was in a car accident and I try and explain but he doesn’t really understand.’She said their six-year-old had asked her: ‘Why did they do it to my daddy?’ and that their other baby was only two months old when her husband was attacked. ‘I have to try and get on with my life. You’ve got to cope, don’t you, and take things day by day. ‘My husband will have to stick this for the rest of his life and he (Hussain) will be out in 20 years.’ Leaving: Hussain had previous convictions for dangerous driving and failing to stop after an accident . Mr Ward is still receiving full-time care more than a year on from the incident in Manchester city centre . The court heard the incident, on John Dalton Street in Manchester, started in ‘horseplay’ between Hussain, from Rusholme, Manchester, and his friends and the group with Mr Ward, from Bolton. But it led to ‘fisticuffs’, with witnesses saying Hussain’s group coming off second best. Minutes later Hussain jumped in the car and drove at the men in revenge. Mr Ward was scooped up on the bonnet before being ‘deposited’ at the side of the road. He was in intensive care for 20 days and spent around four months in a high dependency unit. Paul Hulme, 30, also suffered ‘significant injuries’ with multiple leg fractures after being carried on the bonnet before Hussain veered in the road to knock him off. Aqab Hussain will be banned from driving for 15 years after he has served his 20 year sentence in prison . Martin Harris, 32, suffered bruises as he was side-swiped by the car while a fourth member of Mr Ward’s group, Thomas Mallanphy, narrowly escaped injury after stepping back from the road.Hussain fled to Pakistan after the incident but was arrested at Heathrow when he flew back to the UK six weeks later. He had a string of motoring convictions starting from the age of 16. Hussain was convicted of dangerous driving in October 2008 after making off from police when asked to stop while behind the wheel of a friend’s car. Fourteen months later he was convicted of driving while disqualified and failing to stop after an accident after crashing into a lamppost and another car. And a year later in November 2010, while still disqualified, he was convicted of dangerous driving for a second time and jailed for the first time with 12 months in a young offenders institute. Paul O’Brien, defending, said the attempted murder offences were ‘out of character’ and occurred due to Hussain’s lack of maturity and his desire to show off to friends. He said he came from a good family but had gone off the rails as a teenager.Hussain was also banned from driving for 15 years, which he will serve once he is released two-thirds of the way through his sentence, as is normal practice. Mr Ward faces another major operation on December 21 to have metal plates fitted in his head. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Peach, from Greater Manchester Police, said: ‘This incident started after a minor disagreement between the two groups of men. The CCTV footage demonstrates that Hussain thought he would finish the argument by purposefully using a car as a weapon and deliberately driving into Michael and his friends. ‘The CCTV footage gives an example of how fast he was driving the car and the impact it had with Mr Ward. In all my years of policing, I have not seen anything as shocking as this and I find it amazing that Michael and his friends are still alive. ‘The impact this has had on him and his family has been truly devastating. He is still receiving treatment and his wife visits him every day in hospital. Due to the injuries he suffered, he will no longer be able to play an active part in bringing up his young children. He will need care for the rest of his life. ‘Thanks to the information we received, we were able to arrest Hussain and bring him to justice. ‘However, no sentence can bring back the quality of life Michael once had, and he and his loved ones will have to live with the constant reminder of what happened in the early hours of that morning.’","Aqab Hussain, 21, was already had a driving ban when he hit three people .

Woody Allen refused to make 'customisations' to Blue Jasmine and allow anti-smoking adverts to be inserted into the film . Woody Allen’s movie 'Blue Jasmine' did not debut in India at the weekend after the director objected to anti-tobacco adverts being inserted into scenes where characters smoke. The Indian government requires cinemas to play the adverts before and during any films that feature smoking scenes but the veteran filmmaker refused to make 'customisations'. The decision led to distributor PVR Pictures cancelling the release. 'Blue Jasmine,' which critics have praised as the 77-year-old Allen’s best work in recent years, stars Cate Blanchett as a wealthy New York socialite who endures a humiliating fall from grace after her husband is arrested for financial crimes. The film was supposed to come out in India last weekend, three months after its U.S. release. A spokesman for Allen at the firm 42 West told Reuters: 'Due to content in the film, it cannot be shown in India in its intended manner. 'Therefore, the film is not scheduled to play there.' Sources said Allen wanted the film to be shown in its entirety, as he had made it, and without any modifications. India has banned smoking scenes in movies and television shows, and filmmakers for about a year have been required to show health warnings on screens whenever a character smokes in a film. Typically, a smoking scene would include a text insert at the bottom of the screen warning of the dangers of tobacco use. This is in addition to anti-smoking and anti-tobacco ads that run before films begin. The Indian government requires the adverts to be played in any film that features smoking but Allen refused to make modifications to the movie, starring Cate Blanchett, that has been hailed as his best work for years . The film, starring Alec Baldwin and Cate Blanchett, was due to open in India at the weekend . While most national and international directors accept these rules, Allen was adamant that he would not allow these 'insertions' into his film. India’s film censor board routinely requires cuts and changes to films on the grounds that certain scenes might offend some audiences in the country. It also has banned films, including David Fincher’s 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo' because of rape and torture scenes, and Steven Spielberg’s 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' because of objections to the film’s portrayal of Indians and its imperialist tone. Some directors allow cuts and alterations, while others, such as Fincher, have refused. Many directors, including Martin Scorsese, David Lynch and others, argue that changes to their films are unacceptable because they corrupt the artist’s vision. India forms a miniscule portion of Hollywood revenue, but with a large, English-speaking population, it is a growing market. Hollywood films formed 8.5 per cent of all box office collections last year, according to a report by consultancy KPMG.","Indian government require adverts in any film that features smoking .

A San Diego County man accused of killing his 73-year-old wife and then cooking her body parts has died of cancer while awaiting trial.The district attorney's office announced Friday that 69-year-old Frederick Hengl of Oceanside died of prostate cancer September 27 in the jail infirmary. Hengl had pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder, willful cruelty . to an elder and committing an unlawful act with human remains. He would have faced . 25 years to life in prison if convicted.Hengl was arrested last November after neighbours complained of a foul odour coming from his home in the 400 block of North Ditmar street. Police found the head of his wife, Anna Faris, in a freezer and dismembered parts of her body cooking on a stove. An . officer who entered the home through a window said he saw on the stove . three pans containing what later turned out to be the remains of the . elderly woman. Since no one was home at the time, he climbed through the window and observed what appeared to be meat . cooking in several pans on the stove. Grisly find: The dismembered body of Anna Faris, 73, was found in this Oceanside, California home last November .

When they entered the bathroom, . investigators found a work bench with a saw and boning knife, along with . other cutting instruments. They also came across a plastic bag filled . with chunks of freshly cut bone. Prosecutors believe Hengl killed his . wife on or between the dates of November 1 and 16. Neighbours told . reporters that they had not seen the woman in about a month and had . heard the sounds of a power saw from the couple’s two-bedroom bungalow . style home about two weeks ago.

Gruesome sight: Entering the home police wearing masks discovered what remained of Mrs Hengl whom they said had been dead for at least one day . Tipped off: Next-door neighbour Erick Chavez, 21, said he alerted authorities after a horrible smell poured from the home for a week and a half . ‘My neighbour was just telling me . she'd chase her down the street with a knife or she'd have her clothes . off, pants down; you could tell she was a little bit out of it,’ neighbour Brett Lord told 10News. 'She'd . stand there, feed the birds, talk to folks walking by and her pants . would fall. She didn't seem to notice, ever,' neighbour Jerry Parnell . told 10News.

"By . Anna Edwards . PUBLISHED: . 02:31 EST, 1 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:03 EST, 1 August 2013 . Edward Snowden's documents claim to show details of the XKeyscore programme . U.S. intelligence agencies can search though emails, messaging records and browsing history using a vast search tool according to reports from former security contractor Edward Snowden. Snowden's documents claim to show National Security Agency training materials for the XKeyscore program, a wide-reaching system that covers 'nearly everything a typical user does on the Internet.' Intelligence analysts can conduct surveillance through XKeyscore by filling in an on-screen form giving only a 'broad justification' for the search and no review by a court or NSA staff, the Guardian reported. Snowden's disclosures to media that U.S. intelligence agencies collected data on phone calls and other communications of Americans and foreign citizens as a tool to fight terrorism have sparked uproar in the United States and abroad. Intelligence officials insist the surveillance programs helped thwart terrorist attacks and saved many American lives. 'The implication that NSA's collection is arbitrary and unconstrained is false,' the agency said in a statement in response to the Guardian's new report, calling XKeyscore part of 'NSA's lawful foreign signals intelligence collection system.' Opposition to the sweeping surveillance has been gaining traction in Congress, despite intense lobbying on the intelligence agencies' behalf from the Obama administration, congressional leaders and members of the House of Representatives and Senate Intelligence Committees. President Barack Obama scheduled a meeting for Thursday with Republican and Democratic lawmakers, including the leaders of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives Intelligence Committees, to discuss programs under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a White House official said on Wednesday. Intelligence officials were grilled at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday about their data gathering, the lack of transparency and security lapses that let Snowden get away with so much information. A secret National Security Agency programme allegedly allows analysts to search with no prior authorization through vast databases . Two Democratic members of the committee, Senators Al Franken and Richard Blumenthal, said they would introduce legislation on Thursday to force the Obama administration to provide more information about the data collection programs, including how many Americans' records were reviewed by federal agents. 'The government has to give proper weight to both keeping America safe from terrorists and protecting Americans' privacy,' Franken said. Senior intelligence officials at the hearing said they were open to making some changes in the system. Keith Alexander, the NSA director, jousted with hecklers at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday as he defended the U.S. spy agency's surveillance programs before a crowd of cybersecurity experts and hackers. 'Read the Constitution!' one shouted. But the four-star general replied: 'I have. So should you,' to sustained applause. Snowden's disclosures to media that U.S. intelligence agencies collected data on phone calls and other communications of Americans and foreign citizens as a tool to fight terrorism have sparked uproar in the United States and abroad . Last week, the House defeated by a narrow 217-205 margin a bill that would have cut funding of the NSA program that collects the phone records. Strong support for the measure - bolstered by an unlikely alliance of liberal Democrats and libertarian Republicans - surprised many observers. Snowden, who has been charged under the U.S. Espionage Act and had his passport revoked, left Hong Kong more than a month ago and is stuck in limbo at a Moscow airport while seeking asylum in Russia, which has refused to extradite him. 'If a 29-year-old school dropout could come in and take out massive, massive amounts of data, it's obvious there weren't adequate controls,' Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, the committee chairman, said at the hearing. 'Has anybody been fired?' John Inglis, the NSA's deputy director, said no one had been dismissed and no one had offered to resign. The director of national intelligence released three declassified documents on Wednesday in the 'interest of increased transparency.' They explained the bulk collection of phone data - one of the secret programs revealed by Snowden. Much of what is in the newly declassified documents has already been divulged in public hearings by intelligence officials. The released documents included 2009 and 2011 reports on the NSA's 'Bulk Collection Program,' carried out under the U.S. Patriot Act, the anti-terrorism legislation passed shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. They also included an April 2013 order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which directed communications company Verizon to hand over data from millions of Americans' telephone calls. The declassified documents said the data would only be used when needed for authorized searches. 'Although the programs collect a large amount of information, the vast majority of that information is never reviewed by anyone in the government, because the information is not responsive to the limited queries that are authorized for intelligence purposes,' the 2009 report said. But the secret NSA slide show from 2008, posted by the Guardian on its website, showed that XKeyscore allowed analysts to access databases that collect and index online activity around the world, including searching for email addresses, extracted files, phone numbers or chat activity.","XKeyscore program is National Security Agency's widest-reaching system that covers 'nearly everything a typical user does on the Internet'

Marks & Spencer is launching its own brand of English whisky after signing a deal with one of the country's select few distilleries. Fine Single Malt English Whisky will go on sale this week, made for the retailer by the English Whisky Company at the St George’s Distillery in Norfolk. 'It is the first time we have bottled for one of the big six supermarkets,' Andrew Nelstrop, the company’s managing director, said. 'We have always sold under our own brand before.' Scroll down for video . The spirit is made for M&S by The English Whisky Company, which now produces the equivalent of 150,000 bottles a year. Prince Charles signed one of the first batch barrels in 2007. English whisky is a growing industry. The English Whisky Company began life in 2006 and since then a number of brewers have started micro-distilleries, including Adnams, which now also produces gin. The recipe for M&S is, as Mr Melstrop told The Times, is a light and gentle, with a hint of smoke. The seeds of the English Whisky Company were sown by Lincolnshire farmer James Nelstrop, who hit 60 in 2005 decided not to retire but instead indulge his major passion - whisky. Whisky production  had stopped in England over 100 years ago and it was his dream to resurrect it by building a distillery in Norfolk to take advantage of the county's quality Barley and Breckland water. Prince Charles visited the English Whisky Company in 2007. Since then a number of distilleries have cropped up, with many more on the way . He recruited a distiller from Laphroaig and in December 2006 was able to make the first 29 barrels of English whisky. Since the original distillations back in 2006, the company has made nearly 2,000 casks. It is now exporting to the United States and has even sold a couple of thousand bottles to spirit lovers in Scotland. Mr Nelstrop says he is pleased that English distilleries are now popping up throughout the country. 'When you go into a spirits store, you usually see a wall of Scotch, a shelf each of Irish and Japanese whisky and then everything else as ""other"",' he said. 'I want English whisky to have its own shelf.'","Retailer will sell spirit commonly associated with Scotland and Ireland .

Ministers will today unveil a draft bill that will ban using exotic beasts in big tops. Only domesticated animals, such as rabbits, dogs and horses, will be allowed to perform. The move comes after the Daily Mail exposed the cruelty inflicted on Anne the elephant, who was kept in chains. Owner Bobby Roberts was convicted of animal cruelty after an undercover film showed Anne being kicked and hit with a pitchfork. Scroll down for video . Banned: The Government wants to stop circuses using wild animals and plan to unveil a draft bill. Pictured is an elephant performing at a German circus . The Government's decision comes after an undercover film showed Anne the elephant being attacked with a pitchfork and being repeatedly kicked while at Bobby Roberts' circus . The appalling treatment provoked widespread revulsion and in June 2011, MPs decided without a vote to direct ministers to introduce a ban on wild animals in circuses by 2012. The move was not binding, however, as it was based on a backbench motion from Tory MP Mark Pritchard. Animal rights campaigners have for years been urging the Government to impose the ban on the use of animals such as zebras, lions, tigers, snakes and crocodiles. Bobby Roberts was convicted of animal cruelty over his treatment of Anne the elephant at his circus . Ministers introduced a licensing system last year as an interim measure, with circus owners having to obtain permission from a government-sanctioned vet. Two circuses have since applied to travel with wild animals. Both requests were rejected but they were later granted a licence. Animal welfare minister Lord de Mauley will today try to allay concerns with the publication of the draft bill. A spokesman for the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ‘We announced in March 2012 that it was our intention to ban the use of wild animals in travelling circuses and we are now working towards bringing in a Bill to achieve this.’ Jan Creamer, chief executive of Animal Defenders International (ADI), which sent activists undercover into circuses to expose the cruel treatment of animals, said: ‘A ban on the use of wild animals in circuses is long overdue. ‘There is no place in a civilised society for animals to be forced to endure a lifetime of cruelty and confinement for entertainment. We have found the public is overwhelmingly in support of a ban, as are politicians.’ She added: ‘Last year’s conviction of circus owner Bobby Roberts for the cruelty suffered by Anne the elephant horrified the world. The public has been crying out for a ban since ADI launched the Stop Circus Suffering campaign in 1992 with our first investigation of the suffering of circus animals. ‘Since then, the number of wild animal circuses has dropped from 20 to just two. The end to the use of these animals for entertainment is long overdue and the UK can join the 20 other countries with prohibitions on wild animal circuses.’ Happy: Anne now lives at Longleat Safari Park after the Mail campaign to give her a new home . Of those members of the public who responded to a survey, 94.5 per cent of the public wanted an outright ban on wild animals in circuses. Anne, aged 60 and Europe’s oldest elephant, is now living at Longleat safari park in Wiltshire after the Mail intervened to find her a new home. Generous readers donated £340,000 for her upkeep, and she now lives in the old elephant house and has access to a paddock and a pool. Jan Creamer, chief executive of Animal Defenders International, said: 'There is no place in a civilised society for animals to be forced to endure a lifetime of cruelty and confinement for entertainment.

An artist has created a set of hyper-realistic paintings of famous landmarks around the world which appear to be reflected in the lenses of a pair of sunglasses. The pictures by Simon Hennessey are so lifelike they have often been mistaken for photography. Over the last five years he has painted the Eiffel Tower, Big Ben, Tower Bridge, the Guggeneheim museum in New York, the New York City skyline, the seaside at Skegness and Hyde Park. Detail: Unbelievably, these images are not photographs but astonishingly detailed paintings by talented artist Simon Hennessey .

'My method involves using multiple source photographs and then throughout the painting process I add or remove detail, alter depth, add textures, form and colour values. 'This allows me to and create an illusion of a reality not seen in any single photographic source, and my paintings therefore appear clearer and more distinct than a photograph. 'Most of my paintings are planned before I visit any locations with the camera, especially the iconic buildings which are instantly recognisable. These include Big Ben, Tower Bridge, the Guggenheim museum or the New York city skyline paintings. 'Inspiration for some paintings can evolve from some unlikely moments. I'm always equipped with my camera and a selection of sunglasses. 'I get mostly positive reactions to my artwork, but there are always some negative responses to contend with. 'The most common being ""it looks like a photograph so why bother painting it when a camera can take the picture in less than a second?"".' Simon's pictures feature the Guggenheim museum in New York, as well as the city's skyline, the seaside in Skegness and London's Westminster and Hyde Park .

The Brazilian tycoon who bankrolled the bid to bring the 2016 Olympics to his home country has boasted how he will soon be the world's richest man. Eike Batista, ex-husband of stunning Playboy cover girl Luma de Oliveira, said he would overtake Mexican telecommunications magnate Carlos Slim in the 'next three or four years'. The 55-year-old serial entrepreneur, who has created a $30billion fortune from scratch in just 30 years, said by 2015 he will be making a staggering $10billion per year. As you do: Brazilian multi-billionaire Eike Batista pictured at his Rio de Janeiro home, where his $1.2million dollar Mercedes Benz is kept in the living room . Samba Queen: Brazilian Playboy cover girl and model Luma de Oliveira was married to the country's richest man Eike Batista for 13 years until they divorced in 2004 . This, he claimed, would propel him . clearly in front of Slim's $68.5billion, Microsoft honcho Bill Gates's . $62.4billion and Berkshire Hathaway Warren Buffett's $43.8billion. 'I'm not bragging. It's just a . consequence of all the things that we have done. Just look at the . assets. Jesus, by 2015 we will be making $10billion. 'Between . 2015 and 2020 that will double, or triple. And those are discounted . numbers I'm giving you,' South America's richest man told the Sunday . Times. With . a McLaren F1 Mercedes in his plush Rio de Janeiro apartment living room . and a steely determination that saw him twice become world powerboat . racing champion, it seems they are not idle boasts. His influence over Brazil overtaking . Britain to become the world's sixth largest economy is also not to be . laughed at. The tale of the world's seventh richest man is not a true . one of rags to riches. His father was a famous Brazilian . engineer, who became president of nationalised mining giant Vale, and . who sent his seven children to a private international school in . Brussels.

Filthy rich: Eike Batista, at his firm's HQ in Rio de Janeiro, who claims he will soon become the world's wealthiest man . His monthly allowance did not cover all . his expenses, and so he started selling insurance door-to-door in the . evenings, something he continued to do as he studied engineering at . Aachen in Germany. After dropping out of college just two . years into his course, in 1980 he started to act as an agent between . diamond dealers in Antwerp, Belgium, and Amazon miners. He then started flying to the jungle, buying gold direct from the miners and selling it on. This led to him buying his own mine, the . Novo Planeta, which later became the first mechanised one in the . country. Another eight followed across the continent. Eike Batista has built up a $30billion fortune from scratch over 30 years. He is the richest man in South America - the seventh wealthiest in the world. His EBX Group has assets he claims are worth $1.5trillion. The oil firm he created off Rio coast less than five years ago has reserves of $1trillion . $300billion of high-grade coal in Colombia . $200billion of iron-ore in the inland province of Minas Gerais .

He made $1billion for himself, and $20billion for investors, before the capital markets opened up for Brazilian companies in 2000. His EBX Group is now, he claims, worth $1.5trillion. His mining assets include $300billion of high-grade coal in Colombia, $200billion of iron-ore in the inland province of Minas Gerais and a gold mine he bought for $1.5billion two years ago is now worth four times as much. The oil firm he created off the Rio coast less than five years ago is said to have has reserves of $1trillion and his power company generates 14,000 megawatts per year. He is also building the world's third biggest $50billion airport north of Rio - creating 50,000 jobs. His new Acu superport, which will also be the third largest globally, will also boost the area surrounding Rio. Once he has enough cashflow, which should be in two years time, he said he then wants to 'change my country'. He said: 'I want to construct new departments in universities, modernise them. And great hospitals. Help educate Brazilians. I have learnt to build cathedrals.' But the ex-husband of de Oliveira, whom he divorced in 2004 after 13 years of marriage, also revealed he had no desire to become a politician, adding that: 'This is not Russia, where eventually they take it away from you.' Batista's boast comes in the same month that Brazil's economy overtook Britain's for the first time.   The South American nation became the seventh largest in the world, figures revealed earlier this month. Brazil's total output last year was worth £1.56trillion - compared with £1.53trillion in Britain, think-tank Cebr said. The UK economy grew by just 0.8 per cent last year and contracted by 0.2 per cent in the final quarter, leaving the country on the verge of a double-dip recession. In contrast, economic output rose by 2.7 per cent in Brazil, which has a population of around 200million. Tim Ohlenburg, senior economist at Cebr, said: 'It's a natural enough movement. Brazil has a large population, has massive natural resources and strong local industry. 'It's just a country set for higher growth.' Britain fell one place to seventh in the world economic rankings while Brazil closed the gap on France and Germany.

Souter has been jailed for 22 years after being convicted of sexually abusing seven boys over two decades . A former BBC presenter dubbed a ‘predatory paedophile’ has been jailed for 22 years after being convicted of sexually abusing seven boys over two decades. Ex-BBC Norfolk and Radio Clyde broadcaster Michael Souter was found guilty of 26 offences including indecent assault, indecency with a child, serious sexual offences and seven counts of possessing indecent images of children at a trial which finished earlier this month. He was sentenced at Norwich Crown Court today. Norfolk Police said the 60-year-old, of Low Bungay Road, Loddon, Norfolk, was responsible for ‘one of the worst cases of prolonged child abuse’ officers had dealt with. Souter’s victims and their families packed the court for today’s hearing. Judge Mark Lucraft QC said there were others not covered by the counts in this trial who were also abused by Souter, who showed no emotion as sentence was passed. He described Souter’s attempts to claim that the allegations were fabricated - and that police concocted evidence as part of a conspiracy to smear his name - as ‘pathetic’. ‘The childhood of many of your victims was destroyed and their lives blighted,’ he said. ‘You exploited your position to groom each of them. Hearing: The ex-BBC Norfolk and Radio Clyde broadcaster was sentenced at Norwich Crown Court today . ‘You took hundreds of photographs of . boys in shorts and were the only person in this court who could not see . these pictures for what they were.’ He added that Souter displayed an ‘ongoing sexual obsession with boys’ and posed a risk of further offending on his release from prison. Souter will be banned indefinitely from working with children. He was also ordered to pay legal costs of £14,694 and may be forced to sell properties in the UK and abroad to pay this, the court heard. More possible victims have come forward in the two weeks since Souter's conviction, said Detective Inspector Paul Brown, from Norfolk Police. Referring . to Jimmy Savile, he said revelations following the disgraced DJ’s death . had encouraged victims of child abuse to . speak out. He added: 'While I wouldn’t compare Souter and Savile . directly, both used their celebrity to cultivate a certain respectable . image and both cases have served to highlight that social attitudes are . changing and child abuse will be investigated rigorously by police. 'We . have certainly seen an increase in people coming forward and hopefully . convictions like this can continue to give people the confidence to do . so.' Norwich Crown Court heard Souter was a 'sexual deviant' who was obsessed with young boys in shorts and uniform. The 60-year-old was found guilty of 26 sex offences at Norwich Crown Court and will be banned from working with children indefinitely. The court heard his abuse began in 1979 when he worked at BBC Radio Norfolk . His catalogue of abuse began in 1979 when he worked at BBC Radio Norfolk. Originally . from Scotland, Souter worked as a producer and presenter in both . commercial and BBC radio since the mid-1970s. He had previously . presented for Radio Clyde. Since 1989 he has worked as a freelance broadcaster and had run a media relations consultancy. During . the 1980s and 1990s, Souter’s abuse escalated as he took up senior . positions within the community, including as a Scout leader and social . services youth mentor. Two of the boys were 'repeatedly abused' over five years. The broadcaster was first arrested by . police in 1993 but, because of a lack of evidence against him, he . continued abusing boys for another six years. One victim said in a statement read to the court: 'Souter’s insistence that he is innocent and that this is all lies and conspiracy has not allowed full release and closure.' Andrew Hill, defending Souter, said: 'His position prior to these matters - the charitable works and many other local good works - will all be forgotten when it comes to sentencing. A distinguished career in the Navy and journalistically now comes to nought.'

Beer belly raider: Frank Asante was caught by police stuffing a rucksack up his top to mislead witnesses into thinking he was carrying a bit of extra weight . An armed robber fresh out of jail was collared by police officers despite wearing a fake beer belly in a bid to disguise himself as he carried out a string of raids. Frank Asante hid a full rucksack under his coat to trick witnesses into thinking he had a huge gut as he stormed into bookies across the country. The 40-year-old raided premises in Northampton, Leicestershire, Hertfordshire, Crawley and across London over a two-month period, after being released from prison in Feburary. Woolwich Crown Court heard how the first armed raid came just 16 days after his release from a four-and-a-half-year stint for armed robbery. CCTV evidence showed Asante holding up the various bookies dressed in a black jacket with a hood. Showing the culprit to be brandishing a pistol the images suggested the armed robber was carrying extra weight around his middle. Witnesses told detectives he was easily recognisable because of his 'big belly'. But the ruse was soon uncovered when Flying Squad officers discovered the thug had done a bunk from his bail hostel and started following him to an address in Peckham, south London. They watched as he made his way to a bookies in Newham, east London, with a rucksack on his back. Minutes later they observed as Asante ducked into an alleyway, emerging wearing the rucksack on his front, making it appear as though he had a 'big belly'. Before the convicted criminal could strike, police officers grabbed him and pulled off his disguise. Caught in the act: Asante was spotted by officers following him, emerging from an alleyway with his rucksack stuffed up his top. Officers arrested him in Newham, east London after a string of armed robberies . Asante was found guilty of 12 robberies and 13 counts of possession of a firearm and jailed for 10 years last week. Detective Inspector Mark Field said, this week: 'Only two weeks after being released from prison, this man began a terrifying campaign of armed robberies across the country. 'Wearing a balaclava and armed with a gun, he targeted bookmakers, mostly with lone female members of staff. 'I would like to commend the work of my team who worked closely with colleagues in Northamptonshire, Leicestershire, Hertfordshire and Sussex Police to bring this man to justice.

The Big Six energy firms have tightened their grip on customers, with the number of people switching to rival firms at a record low. As ministers pin their hopes of driving down prices by boosting competition, official figures reveal that the number of people choosing to switch has halved in two years. In June this year just 341,000 customers change gas or electricity supplier, compared to almost 800,000 in summer 2011. Slump: Just 341,000 people changed gas and electricity supplier in June this year, less than half of the numbers who switched in summer 2011 . The revelation is a bitter blow to ministers who have held up switching as the main – and possibly only – way to beat another round of crippling price rises. Four of the Big Six firms have already announced big price rises for this winter. ScottishPower bills are going up by 9 per cent, Npower announced a 10.4 per cent price hike, British Gas a 9.2 per cent rise and Scottish & Southern Energy an 8.2 per cent increase. The government has come under intense pressure to act on soaring bills, after Labour leader Ed Miliband pledged to freeze bills and former Tory Prime Minister Sir John Major demanded a windfall tax on power company profits. Today Energy Secretary Ed Davey again put switching at the heart of the government’s response to rising costs. Crackdown: Energy Secretary Ed Davey wants to make energy companies' profits more transparent . He revealed he wants customers to be able to change supplier within just 24 hours, although only a small independent supplier has suggested this is possible. He told BBC Radio 4 he recently saved £240 from switching. ‘At the moment it can take over five weeks which is completely ludicrous and we’ve seen in the banking sector the Government managed to reduce it down to seven days and I really want to bare down on that and reduce it to a very small amount of time; my ambition is to get it down to 24 hours. ‘We’ve got to work with the industry to deliver that, but I’ve already talked to one of the leading independent suppliers who believes they can get it down to 24 hours, but we’ve got to make sure the other players are in there. I really think we can make a massive change here.’ But latest figures released by his department reveal switching is heading in the wrong direction. In June this year 193,000 people switched electricity supplier and 148,000 changed gas company. On average it is down more than a quarter on the same time last year, and much lower than before the 2008 recession when people had more money to spend. Mr Davey admitted his plan to cut the time it takes to switch will take ‘some time to deliver’ and warned it was only the internet-savvy ‘smart-phone generation’ who get the best deals. The price hikes will add £50 to every family's bill with some households seeing annual rises of more than £100 . In a statement to the Commons today he will announce plans to force energy firms to ‘open their books’ and be fined if price hikes are found to be uncompetitive. The Lib Dem will outline an annual ‘competition test’, under which energy firms will have to declare profits from different arms of their business to make their margins more transparent. Mr Davey will also outline measures to help smaller suppliers break into the market offering lower prices than the Big Six. There are 15 smaller suppliers currently, but they only serve 1 per cent of customers. It comes as official figures yesterday revealed the cost of gas to families has almost tripled – rising by a staggering 190 per cent – in just ten years. Average energy bills have more than doubled, increasing by 120 per cent in the same period, according to the Office for National Statistics. In contrast, the cost of most household goods and services rose by around 30 per cent between 2003 and 2013.

A security guard who beat a delegate at a health conference to death with a fire extinguisher has been jailed for a minimum of 20 years. Clive Carter repeatedly smashed Khanokporn Satjawat over the head with the appliance in a rage after she complained about him repeatedly checking her security pass. The pharmaceutical manager’s body was found on November 12 last year at an HIV medical conference in Glasgow’s Clyde Auditorium, part of the SECC complex. Every bone on the left side of her face and neck was broken and her skull had been shattered into pieces. Carter, a father of three, denied murder, claiming he had no memory of the incident and that he had a borderline personality disorder which meant he could not control his actions. But a jury of eight men and seven women took just over three hours to find him guilty at the High Court in Glasgow yesterday after a trial. Sentencing the killer to life imprisonment, with a minimum tariff of 20 years, judge Lord Matthews said: ‘Khanokporn Satjawat was a hard-working, well-educated and dedicated lady who came to this country to participate in a conference whose purpose was the alleviation of suffering and the saving of lives. ‘It is cruelly ironic that in the course of such an event that the life of that fragile lady should be taken in such a brutal fashion with an instrument whose primary purpose is also the saving of life and the hands of a man to whom she should have been able to look for assistance.’ Carter had admitted killing the Miss Satjawat but denied murder. A jury found him guilty of the crime after a trial at the High Court in Glasgow . Carter, 35, is said to have been obsessed with fire extinguishers and had an image of one on his computer. Only eight days before the murder he had terrified another young woman by knocking on her hotel room door with an extinguisher, claiming he had come to put out a fire. The court heard he snapped after Miss Satjawat questioned him over repeatedly being asked to show her conference ID pass. He picked up a fire extinguisher, followed her into the ladies’ toilets and bludgeoned her to death. The 6ft 5in security guard admitted killing the tiny Thai delegate, who weighed only six and a half stone, but claimed he had no memory of the incident. Carter, 35, is said to have been obsessed with fire extinguishers and had an image of one on his computer . He earlier told the trial the words ‘die, just die’ were in his head as he argued with Miss Satjawat. But after attacking her in the toilets, he went into the staff room and calmly ate the sandwiches he had for his lunch. His victim’s body was discovered lying in a pool of blood by two French doctors who saw Carter leaving the ladies’ toilets holding the fire extinguisher. However, he tried to cover up his brutal crime by washing blood off his weapon, hiding his blood-stained blazer and telling police he had seen a mystery Asian man carrying an extinguisher. The jury heard the security guard had significant anger management issues and had been sent for counselling, but left after two sessions when he became enraged by the counsellor. He has a hair-trigger temper with women and was verbally and physically abusive to his 33-year-old wife Paula, whom he attacked and throttled, the court heard. His victim, Miss Satjawat, had planned to be in Glasgow for the HIV drug therapy conference over five days and was booked into the city’s Marriott Hotel. She had written on Facebook about how excited she was to visit Scotland, and her sister gave a statement on her family’s loss to the court. Carter was found guilty of murder and breach of the peace, after terrifying another young woman on November 4 last year. Stephanie O’Brien, 24, from Cumbria, was staying with three friends at the Holiday Inn Express in Stockwell Street, Glasgow, where Carter also worked as a security guard. He knocked on her door with a fire extinguisher, claiming there had been a report of a fire, but she managed to close and lock the  door on him. Lord Matthews told Carter: ‘You are plainly, on the evidence, a man who is disturbed. However, you are deeply disturbing, as the evidence in this trial has amply demonstrated, including the evidence as to the events at the Holiday Inn Express. ‘One is left to wonder what the outcome might have been had Stephanie O’Brien not had the presence of mind to extricate herself from the hotel room before the situation escalated.’ After the killer was led away to start his sentence, the judge told the jury: ‘Miss Satjawat was a completely innocent individual who came here to enjoy a conference and her body went back to her sister.’ Detective Superintendent John McDonald, of Police Scotland, said last night: ‘This was a particularly brutal and senseless attack which claimed the life of an innocent woman and caused fear and alarm to those attending the conference at the SECC last November. ‘We sincerely hope that this verdict will bring some comfort to the relatives of Miss Satjawat.’","Clive Carter repeatedly smashed delegate Khanokporn Satjawat over the head with fire extinguisher .

A grandmother was killed and her husband left with brain damage after they were run over on a zebra crossing by a driver who was apparently dazzled by the winter sun. An inquest heard how Lynn Steele, 60, and her 64-year-old husband Raymond, from Shaw, near Oldham, Greater Manchester, were walking hand-in-hand across the road when they were mown down by a Toyota Yaris after the driver failed to spot them. The couple, who were on their way back home from booking a holiday at a travel agents, were taken to hospital where grandmother-of-two Mrs Steele died from multiple injuries, including a fractured skull. Lynn Steele (left), 60, and her 64-year-old husband Raymond were mown down on a zebra crossing . Mr Steele was treated for multiple injuries in hospital for four weeks and has no recollection of the events. He lost sight in his left eye because a facial fracture severed his optical nerve and also has lasting brain injuries. An inquest heard how motorists had complained of being temporarily blinded by a low lying and glaring sun at the time of the incident. One witnesses said she was ‘frightened’ by the low-lying sun so had to slow down to a stop because visibility was so poor. The unnamed 60-year-old driver of the Yaris could be seen at the wheel in the moments following the collision with her head in her hands. She escaped the crash uninjured and was stopped at the scene and interviewed under caution but not arrested. She has since passed away from a terminal illness. The couple’s daughter Sarah, who is . blind, said her mother and father had moved in 2010 to their bungalow just metres from the accident spot. She said that since receiving a double . hip replacement when she was 50, Lynn had enjoyed an active life with . her husband, which included walking, swimming and cycling. Sarah said of her father: ‘He can communicate but is always very angry due to the brain injuries. It’s changed his personality. ‘My mum and dad were very careful . people and just because of my experience being with them when they were . with me out and about crossing roads, I can’t understand how this . happened. I find it unbelievable.’ Mr Steele was not able to attend the hearing for health reasons. This is the crossing, on Milnrow Road in Shaw, Greater Manchester, where the couple were run over . The tragedy occurred on January 16 last year in the village of Shaw, near Oldham, Greater Manchester, at 3pm. They were walking across the pedestrian crossing outside shops in the village only to be hit by the Toyota driver who apparently failed to spot them. Witness Julie Sykes who was driving on Milnrow Road shortly before the 3pm crash told the hearing: ‘It was a clear day and dry with good visibility. However as I continued driving through town I noticed the sun was shining very brightly and was low in the sky. ‘I was driving directly into the sunlight and had to put the car’s visor down but it made no difference. Soon I couldn’t see anything. The sun was so bright and so low I found myself looking for the lines on the road. I slowed right down because it was frightened me. I just couldn’t see. Susan Steele, daughter of Lynn and Raymond, said the couple lived in a bungalow minutes from the crossing . ‘I had begun talking to myself, saying, “I hope no-one is on that crossing” because I wouldn’t have been able to see them. I stopped before the crossing because I couldn’t see if anyone was on it because I couldn’t see the crossing. ‘The sun was so low and was on the windscreen. Due to this I actually opened my driver’s side door and put a leg out to stand up and look at the crossing. There was nobody there and it was quiet. ‘When I was back in the car I was still barely able to see and almost missed the left turn and nearly hit a bollard. ‘I was very upset to hear about this but I wasn’t overly surprised. I haven’t experience anything as frightening as that day since.’ Another witness, newsagent Mohammad Iltaf, said: ‘I was looking out of the window and to my right I saw a blue Toyota Yaris doing about 30-35mph and was about 30ft from the crossing. ‘At the same time I noticed an old couple stop on the zebra crossing and they were facing away from me. They then went a couple of steps onto the crossing. ‘The blue Yaris wasn’t stopping and it hit the man and woman and they flew into the air then the car swerved. It came to a stop about 10ft past the crossing. ‘The woman who had been hit was a short distance behind the car. The man had been thrown forwards. I went to help the woman but I ran back to the shop and got a towel for the blood and when I came back a lot of people were around and traffic was backing up. ‘The incident happened in a matter of seconds. The only thing that would have stopped the driver would have been the sun. She would have been blinded by it.’ Motorist Jacqueline Helliwell said: ‘I saw out of the corner of my left eye a shadow fall to the floor. It came from the bonnet of a car. ‘I saw an old lady lying on her left hand side facing towards me and an old man with his back on the road and a stream of blood running towards the gutter. ‘In the stationary blue car there was a lady of about 60 with her head in her hands.’ The inquest at Heywood continues.

Heston Blumental is known for his wacky use of ingredients like snail porridge and his michellin-starred restaurants. But customers have snubbed the celebrity chef in the latest food awards by TripAdvisor. His restaurant The Fat Duck failed to crack the top ten for fine dining, while rival Raymond Blanc’s restaurant Le Manoir Aux Quat’Saisons was named the UK’s favourite. Heston Blumenthal outside The Fat Duck. The restaurant in Bray was snubbed by customers and failed to make the UK's top ten . Feeling the heat? Heston Blumenthal in his lab in Bray next to the Fat Duck which failed to impress customers in this year's awards . Le Manoir is also the only British restaurant to be named among the top ten favourites in the world. He said 'I am thrilled that we have been awarded both these wonderful accolades! They are huge achievements for the team and me at Le Manoir. It has always been imperative that we listen to our guests’ feedback to help us exceed their expectations and it inspires us to continue to strive for perfection.' It’s a setback for Blumenthal having bested other big name rivals in previous years to take the coveted top spot in the Good Food guide and the Fat Duck was the only restaurant to be awarded ten out of ten. The Duck was the bespectacled chef’s first restaurant when he opened it back in 1995 and he soon garnered a reputation for using chemistry in the kitchen. Outlandish dishes like egg and bacon ice cream saw the cook well on his way to three Michelin stars. Gordon Ramsey's The Restaurant was snubbed but there was some consolation for the TV chef as his London-based Petrus came third. Elsewhere the awards spell good news for UK chefs. Second in the country was Devon’s Gidleigh Park in Chagford. French chef Raymond Blanc has welcomed news that customers ranked his restaurant top in the UK for fine dining. His restaurant Le Manoir was also the only British restaurant to make the world list . Head chef Michael Caines has extra reason to crack out the champagne there as the two Michelin-starred restaurant, housed in a Tudor-style manor and set in 55 acres of woodland, also comes ninth in Europe. TripAdvisor’s James Kay said ‘This year’s list of Travellers’ Choice Restaurants award winners proves just how diverse fine dining experiences have become across the UK. Whether you’re as far north as Auchterarder or as far south as Jersey, you’ll be able to find a Travellers’ Choice winner close by.’ 1.

It wasn't only Britain's top chefs who failed to make the cut and René Redzepi will be licking his wounds after his restaurant Noma in Copenhagen missed out. The world’s number one restaurant is the three Michelin starred Maison Lameloise. Perhaps not surprisingly it is located in France which is considered the culinary home of fine dining. Customers were impressed by its prices which start at £56 per person for a weekday lunch. Restaurants in the US, Spain, China, Greece, Italy, Brazil and the Dominican Republic complete the worlds’ top ten. There is irony in the awards list since before opening the Fat Duck, Blumenthal had actually previously worked for a week at Raymond Blanc's Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons in Oxfordshire. Le Manoir Aux Quat'Saisons has two Michelin stars and the Oxfordshire eatery was founded by Blanc himself in 1994. It was also used for filming the BBC2's reality show The Restaurant and prices there start at £79 a head.","Blumenthal's restaurants fail to crack top ten in TripAdvisor's awards .

A couple who left their dog to 'cook to death' in their car as they ate Sunday lunch at a pub which featured in the ITV soap Emmerdale, have been banned from keeping pets. In temperatures reaching 30C, Millie, a seven-year-old Staffordshire bull terrier, 'undoubtedly suffered' in the sweltering heat, despite The Woolpack being a dog-friendly pub. After discovering Millie's body in their car, Anne, 70, and Kenneth Naylor, 59, reported her death to the RSPCA in Bradford, before asking staff at the centre if they had any puppies they could adopt on the SAME day. Anne Naylor and her husband Kenneth enjoyed Sunday lunch at The Woolpack in Esholt. The pub was formerly used to film scenes for the ITV soap Emmerdale. The couple left seven-year-old Millie in the back of their car . The couple, were eating at The Woolpack pub in Esholt while Millie, was left in their car on a baking hot July afternoon. They were banned from keeping animals for three years and each fined £150 after appearing at Bradford Magistrates' Court, yesterday. They both pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to an animal on July 7 - a day where temperatures were close to 30C. The Woolpack pub, in Esholt, featured in the ITV soap from 1976 until 1998 when filming moved to a purpose built village on the Harewood Estate. Millie, a Staffordshire bull terrier, died after an hour in the car with temperatures reaching around 30C . The court heard that despite The Woolpack being a dog- friendly pub - allowing pets in the pub and providing water for them outside - the Naylors decided to leave the seven year old dog in their car while they had Sunday dinner. When they returned an hour later the animal was dead. They drove to the Bradford office of the RSPCA where they revealed what had happened. According to staff they then asked if there were any puppies they could have - a claim the couple deny. Nigel Monaghan, prosecuting, said: 'It beggars belief that after this they can ask for a puppy from the RSPCA.' Steven Kaye, defending, said: . 'They deny that they asked the question about getting another puppy. They say they have no intentions of getting another dog.' RSPCA staff found the dog's body tethered to a seatbelt in the back of the car. When . a member of staff visited the pub to investigate two hours later, at . around 3pm, they recorded the outside temperature as 28C. The couple claimed to have left a back window open, parked in a shady area and left water in the car. A statement from the vet who carried out the post mortem, Graham Roberts, was read to the court. It . said when dogs are left in hot cars their body temperature rises . quickly, heart rate increases and they can suffer from vomiting and . diarrhoea. It added: 'The dog would develop heat stroke and would have undoubtedly suffered. 'It . would have become more distressed as it attempted to cool itself. It . must be one of the most unpleasant ways for a dog to die. A dog in a hot . car is essentially cooked to death.' In mitigation, Mr Kaye said the couple were of good character and had shown remorse after Millie's death. He added: 'This is a very sad case. They loved this dog for many years and have to face the fact they are responsible for her death. 'They didn't feel it was a particularly hot day.' He said Mr Naylor had an inoperable brain tumour, and asked for that to be taken into account when sentencing. As well as the fine, the couple have to pay the RSPCA £100 costs each.","Millie the Staffordshire bull terrier was left in temperatures reaching 30C .

"By . Jaymi Mccann . PUBLISHED: . 12:17 EST, 21 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:55 EST, 21 June 2013 . An undercover police officer who posed as an environmental activist reportedly co-wrote a libellous leaflet that attacked McDonald’s and triggered the longest civil trial in English history. One of the authors of the so-called McLibel leaflet is former police officer Bob Lambert according to a book on undercover policing by Guardian journalists Paul Lewis and Rob Evans. It is claimed in the book, which is released on Monday, that Lambert co-wrote the defamatory six-page leaflet in 1986 - and his role in its production has been the subject of an internal Scotland Yard investigation for several months. Bob Lambert pictured in the 1980s (left) and more recently (right). He is accused of having co-written the leaflet that led to the McLibel case . Mr Lambert is said to have used the alias Bob Robinson during his five years infiltrating the London Greenpeace group, when he was with the special demonstration squad (SDS), a now-disbanded Metropolitan Police unit that targeted political activists. McDonald’s famously sued two green campaigners over the leaflet in a landmark three-year high court case, that was widely considered to have been a public relations disaster for the corporation. However it was never suggested during the costly civil legal proceedings brought by McDonalds in the 1990s that an undercover police officer helped write the leaflet. Mr Lambert (wearing a red jacket) attends a protest during the period he infiltrated London Greenpeace . A raft of allegations have been made against undercover police in recent months including claims officers used dead children’s identities and that some had sexual relationships with the targets of their operations. Mr Lambert now works as a lecturer in terrorism studies at the University of St Andrews, in Scotland. An investigation into undercover policing, called Operation Herne, has been launched by the Metrepolitan Police. Helen Steel and David Morris were sued by the McDonalds corporation after they published a leaflet attacking the company . Derbyshire Police Chief Constable . Mick Creedon was brought in to oversee the operation and recently . confirmed it was 'common practice' for undercover officers within the . SDS to use dead children’s identities. A . statement from the Metropolitan Police said the force 'recognises the . seriousness of the allegations of inappropriate behaviour and practices . involving past undercover deployments'. It . said: 'Operation Herne is a live investigation, four strands of which . are being supervised by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, . and it would be inappropriate to pre-judge its findings. 'The Metropolitan Police Service must balance the genuine public interest in these matters with its duty to protect officers and former officers who have been deployed undercover, often in difficult and dangerous circumstances. 'We are therefore not prepared to . confirm nor deny the identity of individuals alleged in the media to . have been working undercover, nor confirm nor deny the deployment of . individuals on specific operations. The case became the longest running civil case in English history and only ended when the pair took it to the European Court of Human Rights . 'It . is also important to recognise that any actions by officers working on . or with the Special Demonstration Squad need to be understood by . Operation Herne in terms of the leadership, supervision, support, . training, legal framework, tasking and reporting mechanisms that were in . place at the time. 'At some point it will fall upon this generation of police leaders to account for the activities of our predecessors, but for the moment we must focus on getting to the truth.' Mr Lambert has also admitted that he tricked an innocent woman into having an 18-month relationship with him to apparently bolster his cover story. He started dating the woman in the 1980s as he infiltrated Greenpeace to get into the hardline Animal Liberation Front. McDonald's Corporation v Steel & Morris, known as ‘the McLibel case’, was a lawsuit filed by McDonald's Corporation against activists Helen Steel and David Morris in1997. Beginning in 1986, London Greenpeace, a small environmental campaigning group, distributed a pamphlet entitled What’s wrong with McDonald’s: Everything they don’t want you to know. The leaflet accused the McDonald's Corporation of unethical practices . This publication made a number of allegations against McDonald's. The leading allegations were that McDonald's: . Lasting ten years, it became the longest running civil suit in English . history. Despite McDonald's won in part two hearings of the case, they announced that they would not collect the £40,000 that was awarded to them. This was due to the partial nature of the victory, and that it was seen as a David and Goliath style case. The judge in the original hearing confirmed many of the allegations made in the pamphlet were true. On appeal, two more claims made in the pamphlet were given credence by the courts. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled in Steel & Morris v United Kingdom that the pair had been denied a fair trial, in breach of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights and that their conduct should have been protected by Article 10 of the Convention. The court awarded a judgment of £57,000 against the UK government. The woman has admitted that she is still damaged by the experience. She told the Guardian that she was . convinced the romantic, polite and charismatic Lambert was her ideal man . - and had a long-term future with him. But 18 months into their relationship . the decorated officer disappeared and told her he was moving to Spain . because he feared being caught by the police. Two Guardian journalists allege that Lambert was a co-writer of the McLibel leaflet . She told the Guardian: 'I was cruelly . tricked and it has made me very angry. I am actually quite damaged by . the whole thing. I am still not over it.' Having a partner that believed his cover story meant that Lambert could infiltrate the group more easily. The former officer told the website . Spinwatch in a response to their open letter: 'I apologise unreservedly . for the deception I therefore practiced on law abiding members of London . Greenpeace. 'I also apologise unreservedly for . forming false friendships with law abiding citizens and in particular . forming a long term relationship with (the woman) who had every reason . to think I was a committed animal rights activist and a genuine London . Greenpeace campaigner.' He added: 'I should point out here . that the vast majority of Met special branch undercover officers never . made the mistakes I made, have no need to apologise for anything, and I . deeply regret having tarnished their illustrious, professional . reputation. 'My deceptions in the 1980s were all premised on maintaining the fiction required to perform my undercover role.' In the late 1990s, Mr Lambert became . head of the Special Demonstration Squad and was responsible for placing . police moles in political organisations. From 2002 to 2007, he was in charge . of Scotland Yard's Muslim Contact Unit, tasked with preventing Islamic . extremism by way of two-way dialogue with the Muslim community. Since 2006, he has lectured at Exeter and St Andrew's universities.","Former police officer Bob Lambert is alleged to have co-written the leaflet .

Turmoil: Men in their 30s, 40s and 50s are at the highest risk of suicide, a new study has found (file photo) Men in their 30s, 40s and 50s are at the highest risk of suicide, with the changing job market and family breakdowns leaving them in turmoil about their role in life, a study has found. About 3,000 men aged between 30 and 60 take their own lives each year. This is more than twice the rate among young men – those in their late teens and 20s – who used to be the highest-risk group. The group of men most at risk, many born during the Swinging Sixties, are described as a ‘buffer generation’ – unsure whether to behave like their traditionally masculine fathers or younger men who are more in touch with their feelings. Experts say cultural changes, such as the decline of traditional masculine jobs and lifelong marriages, have challenged the men’s sense of ‘masculine pride and identity’. Men in the 35-55 age group also tend to be more dependent on their partner for emotional support than women are, and have fewer friends outside marriage, so they take divorce and separation harder, according to the report from the Samaritans. Working-class men have been affected by recent rises in unemployment and the shift to a service economy which values people skills. They are ten times more likely to kill themselves than affluent men. Stephen Platt, professor of health policy at Edinburgh University, said: ‘We’re thinking of the rise in female employment, births outside marriage, the rise in divorce and cohabitation, second and subsequent marriages, lone parent households, step-families, solo living, partnering and de-partnering. ‘All these trends mean that men are less likely to be with a lifelong partner, and if you ally that with their difficulties in coping emotionally and being able to go out and establish new relationships with less support to fall back on than women, that makes them more vulnerable to psychological ill health and suicide.’ Until eight years ago, men aged 15 to 35 had the highest suicide rate, along with elderly people, but both of these have gone down, while suicides in mid-life, particularly the 35-to-55 age group, have gone up. Professor Platt, a trustee of the charity, added: ‘One of the problems for men is this need to aspire to a kind of gold standard of masculinity which is often very difficult to meet. ‘The current generation of men are often called the buffer generation. They are caught between an older generation which is more silent, more resilient, less expecting to deal with emotions openly and a younger generation who are more used to expressing emotions in an open way.’ Rory O’Connor, one of the authors, a professor of psychology at Stirling University, said this generation may carry a higher suicide risk with them throughout their lives – what scientists call a ‘cohort effect’. He said: ‘Suicide is the ultimate response to feeling trapped. The male role is less well defined than it was 20, 30 years ago and men have great difficulty responding to the challenge of how we define ourselves as men.’ The report recommends better education to help young people cope with life stresses and helping healthcare workers identify those known to be at high risk of suicide such as heavy drinkers.","Middle-aged men are at the highest risk of suicide, according to new study .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:18 EST, 15 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 00:19 EST, 15 August 2013 . The mysterious death of famed investigative journalist Michael Hastings took a surprising turn this week when it was revealed that the target of his latest expose was CIA Director John Brennan. Hastings was killed in a fiery car crash in the Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles about 4:25 a.m. on June 18, of this year. Witnesses described his speeding Mercedes coup as creating sparks and flames before it fish-tailed into a palm tree and exploded. Hastings' body was burned beyond recognition. Earlier that day, Hastings had sent an email to his editor at the website Buzzfeed alerting him that 'the Feds are interviewing my ""close friends and associates."" Perhaps if the authorities arrive ""BuzzFeed GQ,"" er HQ, may be wise to immediately request legal counsel before any conversations or interviews about our news-gathering practices or related journalism issues.' Mystery: the mystery behind the tragic death of journalist Michael Hastings continues to grow . He added that 'Also: I'm onto a big story, and need to go off the radat for a bit.' Hours later, Hastings was dead. The big story he was working now appears to be about spy chief Brennan, who has been described in secret emails from the President of CIA contractor Stratfor, Fred Burton - and released by Wikileaks -as being on a 'witch hunt' of investigative journalists. Hastings' wife, Elise Jordan, revealed on Piers Morgan's show on CNN earlier this month that the story Hastings was working on at the time of his death was about Brennan. The CIA confirmed Jordan's claim to San Diego 6 News, which says that when they brought the information - as well as a leaked email from Stratfor - to Brennan's spokesperson, he responded 'with lightning speed.' 'Witch hunt': Leaked emails from a CIA contractor claim that CIA Chief John Brennan is going after investigative journalists . Inferno: skeptics are suspicious of the intensity of the flames that engulfed Hastings' car the night he was killed . Reporter Kimberly Dvorak says she received two emails from the CIA spokesman, one acknowledging that Hastings was working on a story about the CIA, and another stating that 'without commenting on information disseminated by WikiLeaks, any . suggestion that Director Brennan has ever attempted to infringe on . constitutionally-protected press freedoms is offensive and baseless.' Jordan says the article about Brennan will appear in an upcoming issue of Rolling Stone magazine. Conspiracy theorists have jumped all over Hastings' death because he has a proven history of bringing down powerful people (his Rolling Stone article about General Stanley McChrystal effectively ended the general's career) and a collection of secret sources within the highest levels of government. Beyond Recognition: Authorities had to use dental records to identify Hastings' body . Tragic: Elise Jordan, widow of Michael Hastings, says his death is likely just a tragic accident . The cryptic emails aside, skeptics have asked where was Hastings going at 4:25 a.m., when witnesses say he was speeding AWAY from his house? Why would he be going so fast on a residential street (authorities say he was traveling 'at top speed' when he hit the tree, although that, too, has been questioned). Those suspicious of a coverup in Hastings' death even question the intensity of the fire that seemed to instantly engulf Hastings' car after it hit the tree. Some have even suggested that a device was installed in Hastings' car that allowed someone outside of the vehicle to control it's speed and direction - although, those claims have been widely rejected as baseless, as there's no known evidence to suggest that anyone but Hastings was in control of the vehicle, or that such a device even exists. Adding to the suspicion is the fact that several government agencies - both local and federal - have been slow to turn over public records about the crash, despite hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests from journalists across the country. When asked if she subscribes to any of the conspiracy theories about her husband's untimely death, Jordan says 'the LAPD still has an active investigation...my gut here is that it was just a really tragic accident and I'm very unlucky and the world is very unlucky.'","Brennan has has been described in secret emails from .

Famed attorney Jose Baez said today the girl accused of bullying a classmate to suicide has been 'bullied by the system' and did not say one negative thing to the victim. Baez is representing Katelyn Roman, 12, from Florida, who was arrested and charged with stalking earlier this month after Rebecca Sedwick, 12, jumped to her death in an abandoned concrete factory on September 10. Baez, who was the lawyer behind Casey Anthony's acquittal, has blamed Polk County Sheriff Judd for starting up a media storm by publicly naming and shaming Roman and her co-accused Guadalupe Shaw, 14. Attorney: Jose Baez is representing Guadalupe Shaw, 14, who was arrested and charged with stalking earlier this month after Rebecca Sedwick, 12, jumped to her death in an abandoned concrete factory on September 10 . Suspended: Katelyn Roman ,12 (left), and Guadalupe Shaw, 14 (right), were arrested earlier this month for stalking 12-year-old Rebecca Sedwick who committed suicide on September 10. A source told Radar that they've been kicked out of school . Too young: 12-year-old Rebecca Sedwick (pictured above) committed suicide last month by jumping off an abandoned concrete factory . 'I think [the sheriff] is going beyond . the scope of his job as a law enforcement officer. His job is to . investigate and make arrests. 'I represent people accused of crimes as . well as victims of crimes. She falls under both categories,' he told CBS. 'My client has been the victim of bullying in . the past and she is currently being bullied by the system.' Sheriff Judd said last week he believes Baez only took on the case for publicity reasons and said in a news conference: 'Mr Baez, here's my message to you - Get . over trying to show she didn't do something she did and start trying to . help that child.' In response to that Baez said:  'I really don't care what Sheriff Judd . has to say. I don't need publicity. This case is smaller than other . cases I've handled before.' 'What I plan on doing in this case is . move away from shifting the blame and actually help people learn from . this experience,' he said. 'At the end of the day, all parties' goals . are to turn this horrible tragedy into something positive.' Famed: Jose Baez, who is the lawyer behind Casey Anthony's acquittal, is accused of taking on the case for publicity purposes . Devastated: Rebecca Ann Sedwick, 12, pictured with her mother Tricia Norman, is said to have had a disturbing upbringing . On Monday, it was revealed Shaw and Roman were suspended from school for one year in relation to the incident. Since her arrest, Katelyn's parents have hired Casey Anthony's attorney Jose Baez to represent her. The same source close to the family said that Katelyn's family are worried about their honor-student's chances of getting back into the public school system. 'There is no guarantee that after a year you are allowed back into the public school system and that is if you are acquitted of all charges even,' the source said. According to the source, Katelyn had the third highest state testing score in Polk County a few years ago but now won't even be able to continue her education electronically. The two girls were part of a group of 15 girls who tormented Rebecca Sedwick at Crystal Lake Middle School in Lakeland, Florida. Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said Guadalupe was singled out for arrest after she posted an insensitive tweet about Rebecca's death. 'Yes IK [I know] I bullied REBECCA nd [sic] she killed her self but IDGAF [I don't give a f***],' Guadalupe allegedly posted. 'We decided that we can't leave her out there. Who else is she going to torment, who else is she going to harass?' he said. But Sheriff Judd also announced last week that the bullying may have only been one part of Rebecca's decision to commit suicide. Judd said that Rebecca was also having problems at home and these may have contributed to the state of her mind on the day of her death. He told CBS she slept on a recliner instead of a bed and her sister slept on the couch, while the girls' clothes were kept in 'grocery sacks' in the living room. Rebecca's mother Tricia Norman has been in trouble with the law since as far back as 1995 and has criminal convictions for writing bad checks, fraud and probation violation. David Henry, the lead attorney on the . case, told Crimesider that Rebecca's father was not involved in the . family's life and that Norman 'was doing her best' with her children. Tragic loss: Rebecca with her sister Amy . Katelyn was Rebecca's former best friend, but Judd said the 14-year-old turned her against Rebecca. Other girls also stopped being friends with her in fear of being bullied, the sheriff said. 'Several students corroborated stories of both girls bullying Sedwick on different occasions, through name-calling, intimidation, threats to beat her up, and at least one actual physical fight,' the sheriff said. It is believed the bullying started when Guadalupe started dating Rebecca's ex-boyfriend. Witnesses told investigators she sent messages to Rebecca, calling her ugly, telling her to 'drink bleach and die', and encouraging her to kill herself. Rebecca's computer searches revealed she had searched for ways to commit suicide and asked questions like, 'What is overweight for a 13-year-old girl' . One of the Florida girl's screensavers also showed Rebecca with her head resting on a railroad track. Aftermath: Rebecca's sister Summer (left) and a friend sign a poster after her death. Two people have now been arrested in connection with the bullying . She changed one of her online screen names to 'That Dead Girl.' She messaged a boy: 'I'm jumping.' Polk County Sheriff Judd said Rebecca had been 'absolutely terrorized' by the other girls. 'We can see from what we've been investigating so far that Rebecca wasn't attacking back,' Judd said. 'She appeared to be beat down. She appeared to have a defeatist attitude. And quite frankly, the entire investigation is exceptionally disturbing.' Even when her mother took Rebecca out of school, the bullying was carried out online. The bullying started over a boy last year at Crystal Lake Middle School and at one point she was suspended for fighting with another student - believed to be Katelyn. Last December, Rebecca was hospitalized for three days after cutting her wrists because of what she said was bullying, according to the sheriff. 'When she was being bullied at Crystal Lake Middle, she used to come home every day and tell me how she wasn’t worth anything, that she was ugly, how she was stupid,' her mother Tricia Norman said after her death. 'And I said, ''Baby what on earth would make you think that? You’re the most beautiful person I know and the smartest person I know.''' Bullied: Rebecca was withdrawn from her . elementary school after being bullied and was home schooled by her mother Tricia (right) who says her daughter's death should be a warning to all parents to be vigilant . Later, after Rebecca complained that she had been pushed in the hallway and that another girl wanted to fight her, Rebecca's mother began home-schooling her, Judd said. This fall, Rebecca started at a new school, Lawton Chiles Middle Academy, and loved it, Judd said. But the bullying continued online. 'She put on a perfect, happy face. She never told me,' Tricia Norman told the Lakeland Ledger. 'I never had a clue. I mean, she told me last year when she was being bullied, but not this year, and I have no idea why.' Once police checked her cell phone they discovered that the bullying had not stopped, especially on Kik Messenger, Instagram and Ask.fm. 'They would tell her she's ugly, stupid, nobody liked her go kill herself,"" Ms Norman said. She has started a Facebook page to try to fight back against online bullies, called Rebecca Sedwick Against Bullying. Ms Norman told 10 News she was inspired to start it after reading her daughter's journal. In it, Rebecca had written: 'Every day more and more kids kill themselves because of bullying. How many lives have to be lost until people realize words do matter?' Ms Norman wants online bullies to face harsher consequences, and begged other young victims to stay strong and seek help, adding: 'Don't ever give up, like Becca did.'","Katelyn Roman, 12, and Guadalupe Shaw, 14, were arrested earlier this month for stalking 12-year-old Rebecca Sedwick .

Concerned: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is believed to be worried about a poll which shows that support for the Tories had dropped by 20 per cent among the Countryside Alliance . The Conservatives are haemorrhaging one in eight of their strongest supporters in the shires to Ukip. An astonishing poll showed that support for the Tories had dropped by 20 per cent among the Countryside Alliance. Its members are usually among the most committed Tory campaigners, with 15,000 of its supporters leafleting for the party at the last election. The army of rural volunteers were part of the campaign group Vote OK, which is partly organised by David Cameron’s stepfather-in-law, Viscount Astor. Rural campaigners helped the Tories win 36 target seats in 2010. Election turn-out also went up whenever Vote OK poured its members into a constituency, according to a study by the Electoral Commission. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson was presented with a shock poll earlier a few weeks ago however showing that 13 per cent of Countryside Alliance members planned to vote UKIP at the general election. Just 66 per cent would vote Tory if there was an election tomorrow, while 2 per cent would back Labour. In 2006, a similar poll registered no support for UKIP among the 100,000-strong membership of the Countryside Alliance. Back then, 86 per cent said they would vote Conservative. Mr Paterson is believed to have been worried by the poll and the impact the loss of Countryside Alliance support would have on the campaign network outside London, according to the Spectator Magazine. Countryside campaigners feel betrayed by the Prime Minister’s failure to deliver on his promise of a free vote to repeal the hunting ban. Tim Bonner, director of campaigns at the Countryside Alliance told the Mail: ‘A large part of the rural community is frustrated that government policies do not seem to take their views into account. Issues like HS2, hunting and development in the countryside are hugely emotive and many living in the countryside feel the Government is more interested in urban issues and that their votes are being taken for granted. This situation has become a matter of trust between the countryside and the Government.’ Rural families pay 25 per cent more for fuel per month compared to those in urban areas. Frustrated: Countryside campaigners feel betrayed by the Prime Minister¿s failure to deliver on his promise of a free vote to repeal the hunting ban . They want the duty discount on petrol and diesel for those in the Hebrides, Northern Isles and the Isles of Scilly to be extended to other rural areas. They were also concerned about a lack of affordable homes in the countryside, crime and poor broadband and mobile services. Some 64 per cent of people living in the countryside do not believe coalition policies are helping them, and nearly three quarters,73 per cent, think politicians are more interested in the views and values of city residents. Julian Price, an Oxfordshire farmer who canvassed for the Tories in target seats at the last two elections, told the Spectator he could no longer vote for the Tories. ‘I genuinely believe that Cameron has used us to get in and is now wiping his hands of us,’ he told the magazine. ‘All my family have always been Conservatives. But what they promised they would do for me they have gone back on. I genuinely feel that Ukip are more for us country people and farmers now.’ Before the last election, Mr Cameron described himself as a ‘country boy’ who had grown up fishing and ‘shooting rabbits’. He is also known to have been a member of his local Oxfordshire hunt. But he was foiled from going deer stalking this summer by his bad back.","Poll shows support for Tories drops by 20% among Countryside Alliance .

Billie-Jean Biria didn't plan to hike more than a half mile on September 18 when she took her 10-month-old son Shadan and two dogs to search for her son's missing red beanie. But the 34-year-old mother lost her way and couldn't find her way back to her husband's hunting camp near Beaver Marsh, Oregon. Twenty-one hours later, after spending the night in a hollowed out tree, she was rescued thanks to help of about 50 volunteers. Lost and found: Billie-Jean Biria (above) got lost in the woods of Southern Oregon last month while looking for a lost hat with her 10-month-old son Shadan . Moved by all the people that came out to find her and her young son, Mrs Biria is now training to volunteer on similar search-and-rescue operations. Mrs Biria was reported missing around 4:30 the afternoon of September 18. She says that when she finally found her son's beanie, she turned around and lost site of camp. 'I took for granted I knew where I was going,' she told the Herald and News. So she had the dogs sniff their way back to the camp, but eventually realized they were just sniffing the scents of the forest. Her surroundings became more unfamiliar and she knew she was just drifting further away from camp. As it became dark, Mrs Biria found shelter in a hollowed-out tree. She curled up and warmed her son underneath her shirt to wait for morning. Shelter: Mrs Biria and 10-month-old Shadan (left) spent the night sleeping in a hollowed out tree when they couldn't find their way back to camp . 'At no point was I scared,' she said. 'I think my maternal instincts kicked in'. At first light, Mrs Biria tried walking up hill to look for a road. At one point she heard a helicopter pass overhead, but couldn't get the pilot's attention. She was finally rescued later that afternoon when she heard her husband's truck and started in the direction of the noise where she found camp. In an interesting twist, it was right after hearing her husband's truck that she lost the red beanie yet again. This time, she didn't go back for it. It was back at camp that she saw the massive effort that was organized to search for her. She estimates that there were 50 or 60 people out combing the woods. Paying it forward: After seeing the large group of volunteers that put in the time to look for her, Mrs Biria decided to train to become a search-and-rescue volunteer herself . 'I didn't know I was such a big deal,' she said. 'It was a lot of people. I was amazed and thankful'. According to Klamath County Sheriff Sgt Randall Swan, a smaller group of local volunteers spent the night looking for Mrs Biria, but when they were unsuccessful they called in volunteers from California and other regional counties. 'We call it pushing the big button,' Sgt Swan said. Inspired by all the people who took the time to search for her, Mrs Biria is currently training to be a search-and-rescue volunteer herself. She attended a rescue academy last weekend.","Billie-Jean Biria and her 10-month-old son Shadan went missing on September 18 after getting lost looking for a hat near their camp .

A long-lost Orson Welles film has finally had its U.S. premiere some 75 years after the unfinished silent movie was produced by the cinema genius. Too Much Johnson, which pre-dates his masterpiece debut Orson Welles, was recently discovered in an Italian warehouse and had its first ever American screening in Rochester, New York on October 16. The . film was supposed to accompany a stage production of a William Gillette . play and stars Joseph Cotten - who was to collaborate with Welles again . in the 1941 Citizen Kane and again in 1949's The Third Man. The play opened without the film in August 1938 and flopped. Scroll down for video . Welles made the silent slapstick comedy in New York City shortly before heading to Hollywood to film Citizen Kane, considered by many critics to be the best movie ever made . Welles died in 1985 and believed that the only remaining copy of the film had burned up in a 1970 fire that had destroyed his home in Spain . The U.S. screening took place at the Dryden Theater at the George Eastman House, where experts restored the 35 mm nitrate work print of the film . The U.S. screening took place at the Dryden Theater at the George Eastman House, where experts restored the 35 mm nitrate work print of the film. Italian film archivists announced in August that a copy of 'Too Much Johnson originally believed destroyed in a fire had been found in a box by a shipping company in Pordenone, a northeastern Italian city that's home to the Le Giornate del Cinema Muto silent film festival where the film had it global premier earlier this month. The film was turned over to a local film society, but the find seemed of no particular value and was left unopened for many years. Circo Giorgini, an Italian expert on Welles, identified the film about three years ago. The only remaining copy was believed to have been burned up in a 1970 fire that destroyed Welles' home in Madrid, Spain. Welles died in 1985. How the film arrived in Pordenone remains a mystery. The film was supposed to accompany a stage production of a William Gillette play, but the play opened without the film in August 1938 and flopped . Film accompaniment: Orson Welles wanted his 40-minute, three-act film to be prologues for the three acts of a William Gillette play he was putting on at the Mercury Theater . 'This is by far the most important film restoration by George Eastman House in a very long time,' said Paolo Cherchi Usai, senior curator of film, who supervised the project. 'Holding in one's hands the very same print that had been personally edited by Orson Welles 75 years ago provokes an emotion that's just impossible to describe.' Welles made the silent slapstick comedy in New York City shortly before heading to Hollywood to film Citizen Kane, considered by many critics to be the best movie ever made. Too Much Johnson, filmed in 1938, has nowhere near the complexity of Kane or the tense thrills of The Third Man but offers a never-before-seen glimpse at the skills of one of cinema's greats. It had never been shown in public and . was at one time lost to Welles himself, who expressed his shock at . finding a copy in storage at his home near Madrid, Spain. It . was this copy of the film, which most experts agreed was the only copy, . that was destroyed in a fire at Welles's home in the 1970s. The film was designed to run for 40 minutes, with 20 minutes devoted to the play's prologue and two 10-minute introductions for the second and third act . But a virtually pristine print was recently discovered in an Italian warehouse, and has now been restored by George Eastman House. The film was not intended to stand by . itself, but was designed as the cinematic aspect of Welles's Mercury . Theater stage presentation of William Gillette's 1894 comedy. The play follows the fortunes of a New . York playboy who flees from the violent husband of his mistress and . borrows the identity of a plantation owner in Cuba - who is expecting the . arrival of a mail-order bride. The film was designed to run for 40 minutes, with . 20 minutes devoted to the play's prologue and two 10-minute . introductions for the second and third act. Welles wanted it to be a . silent film in the tradition of the Mack Sennett slapstick comedies, in . order to enhance the various chases, duels and comic conflicts of the . Gillette play. In addition - and typical of Welles's innovation - live music and live sound effects would be synchronized with the footage to provide a 'surround sound' effect for the audience. But the film was never fully . finished. It was anticipated that the play would be a flop and Welles . let the film project die a natural death, putting the footage in . storage. He recalled in a . later interview that he was surprised to find a copy at his home, . saying: 'I can't remember whether I had it all along and dug it out of . the bottom of a trunk, or whether someone brought it to me, but there it . was. Long-time collaboration: The unseen film stars Joseph Cotten - seen here with Welles in 1949's The Third Man. Welles himself said Cotten's performance was amazing, but nonetheless did not want the film shown publicly . Masterpiece: Citizen Kane - the 1941 film written, directed by and starring Orson Welles - is widely regarded as the best film ever made . 'I screened it, and it was in perfect . condition, with not a scratch on it, as though it had only been through . a projector once or twice before. It had a fine quality. 'Cotten was magnificent, and I immediately made plans to edit it and send it to Joe as a birthday present.'. But Welles never allowed the footage to be seen publicly, stating the film would not make sense outside of the full context of the Gillette play . The recent copy was found in a warehouse by the staff of Pordenone arthouse Cinemazero. Other Mercury Theater actors that appear in the film include Eustace Wyatt, Edgar Barrier, Ruth Ford, Arlene Francis, Mary Wickes, Welles himself and his wife Virginia Nicholson. The play opened without the film on August 16, 1938 - and flopped. The unfinished nitrate work print was given by Cinemazero to Italian film archive Cineteca del Friuli, which transferred it to George Eastman House to be preserved with a grant from the National Film Preservation Foundation. Paolo Cherchi Usai, senior curator of film, who supervised the project for George Eastman House, said: 'This is by far the most important film restoration by George Eastman House in a very long time. Holding in one’s hands the very same print that had been personally edited by Orson Welles 75 years ago provokes an emotion that’s just impossible to describe.' Despite the fact that it pre-dates Citizen Kane, even Too Much Johnson is not Welles's directorial debut. In 1934, while still attending The Todd School for . Boys, he co-directed (with friend William Vance) a short avant garde . film called The Hearts Of Age.","Too Much Johnson was made by the famous director prior to his 1941 masterpiece Citizen Kane .

Officers in Scotland have revealed they are studying emails which suggest that Unite and its official Stephen Deans were instrumental in thwarting the Labour Party’s probe of the union’s influence in Falkirk. Mr Deans resigned from his role as Unite boss at the Grangemouth refinery on Monday. The news came as David Cameron launched an outspoken assault on Ed Miliband for failing to re-open Labour’s internal inquiry. The Prime Minister branded the Labour leader ‘weak’ for failing to discipline Mr Deans, who remains chairman of the Falkirk West constituency party, which has been taken into ‘special measures’ by the Labour leadership. In heated exchanges at Prime Minister’s Question Time, Mr Cameron said: ‘We need to have a proper inquiry into what happened in Unite, a proper inquiry into what happened in Grangemouth, because we all know the leader of the Labour Party is too weak to do it himself.’ Gesturing at Mr Miliband, Mr Cameron added: ‘If they had any courage, any vision, any strength of decision-making, they’d recognise they need to have that inquiry and get to the bottom of what happened.’ The scandal erupted when four members of the Kane family in Falkirk complained that they had been signed up as Labour members without them knowing. At that time Mr Deans was trying to get Karie Murphy – a close friend of Unite boss Len McCluskey – selected as the Labour candidate. Prime Minister branded the Labour leader 'weak' for failing to discipline Mr Deans, who remains chairman of the Falkirk West constituency party .

A panicked German pensioner left two teenage girls crippled after he tried to stop his campervan hurtling down a steep hill by mistakenly slamming the clutch. Holidaymaker Arnold Kasserra thought he was flooring the brake pedal, but his Fiat Advantage camper merely gained more speed as it raced down the hill in Beer, East Devon. He narrowly avoided mowing down two women in their 50s after he missed a bend and ended up freewheeling the wrong way down one-way Common Lane. Panicked: German tourist Arnold Kasserra with his wife Evelyn. Kasserra's whose runaway camper van left two girls badly hurt after he pressed the clutch and not brake pedal as he tried to stop it . But the out-of-control van then ploughed into a stone wall, went flying and smashed into a group of 16-year-old girls who were out celebrating their GCSE results. At Exeter Crown Court today, 67-year-old Kasserra admitted two charges of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and was jailed for 18 months, suspended for two years. He said he was unable to forget the consequences of his ‘error and panic’. The two badly injured victims were among a group of of five girls from Bristol who had chosen to celebrate their excellent exam results in the quiet fishing village rather than going to loud and popular Newquay, the court heard. Both girls - Natalie Palmer and Victoria Vipond - had been keen sportswomen, however both have been left incapacitated after suffering severe leg injuries. The impact also broke Natalie's neck. In a victim impact statement Victoria said she cannot wear shoes, has had a toe amputated, uses crutches and has had skin grafts to cover unsightly holes in her shin and foot. She has not been able to go back to school and has not been able to continue with her love of tap and jazz dancing. Wheelchair bound Natalie, who could have died three times from her injuries, has to wear a neck brace, spends most of her time in bed and needs her parents help to do basic tasks. Haunted by his 'error and panic': At Exeter Crown Court today, 67-year-old Kasserra admitted two charges of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and was jailed for 18 months, suspended for two years . Prosecutor Eleanor Perkiss said: 'This is a tragic case for all concerned.' She said Kasserra kept pressing the wrong pedal with his foot and the camper van was gaining speed down the hill for 20 seconds before the awful impact next to a pub and tea room in the quiet seaside fishing village. She said Kassera, a former engineer, who was with his wife Evelyn in the van, failed to sound his horn to warn passers-by and other road users. Miss Perkiss said he struck a stone wall, which disintegrated. The van became airborne and struck the girls before coming to rest on an open culvert - which prevented it ploughing into a tearoom. She said Kassera was used to driving the van over nine years throughout Europe but in his panic he kept pressing the wrong pedal and van gained more speed and went out of control. Defence barrister Adrian Chaplin said: 'He went to brake for the bend but he made the error that continued, fuelled by panic, as he progressed down the hill. 'It was a failure to press the right pedal. There was nothing wrong with the vehicle. At no stage was he driving dangerously deliberately.' Kasserra's Fiat Advantage after the crash: Natalie Palmer and Victoria Vipond had been keen sportswomen, however both have been left incapacitated by severe leg injuries. The impact also broke Natalie's neck . Kassera, from Lower Saxony, said his wife screamed at him to apply the handbrake, but the court heard this might have been an even more dangerous manoeuvre. The judge, Recorder William Andreae-Jones QC, said: 'The two girls have suffered an appalling accident through no fault of their own. There can be no doubt, this accident was your fault.' He told the defendant he had no previous convictions, admitted his guilt at the first opportunity, was full of remorse and said drink or drugs played no part in the morning accident in July. The court heard that both Kassera and his wife were hurt in the crash. Judge Andreae-Jones told Kasserra: 'It was an appalling accident which just happened because you lost your head. You were pressing the wrong pedal and panicked. ' He jailed the German for 18 months, suspended for two years, banned him from driving for five years and ordered him to pay £1,000 court costs. The judge said his insurance company would sort out compensation for the injured girls as they continue their long journey towards recovery.

A pair of burglars have been jailed for breaking into a cafe late at night because they 'fancied a piece of quiche'. Barry Kirsopp and Dean Thompson sparked a six-hour police siege after they refused to leave a roadside cafe near Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland. The pair were surrounded by 30 officers and 15 patrol cars, while Kirsopp threatened the police with kitchen knives and a broomstick which he had fashioned into a spear. Jailed: Barry Kirsopp, left, and Dean Thompson, right, admitted burglary and affray at Newcastle Crown Court . Yesterday they were jailed at Newcastle Crown Court after both pleading guilty to burglary and affray. Kirsopp, 21, was given a 26-month sentence after the judge ruled that he was the ringleader, while Thompson, 20, was sentenced to 22 months. The incident took place at Cafe@Marshalls, in Stremerton, on August 12 this year. Police officers and negotiators, who were waiting outside the building with tasers, took six hours to convince them to give themselves up. During sentencing yesterday, prosecutor Kevin Wardlaw said: 'The offence of burglary develops into a stand off between the defendants and the police. Break-in: The pair barricaded themselves inside Cafe@Marshalls near Berwick-upon-Tweed on August 12 . 'Various threats are made, particularly by Kirsopp who states he is not coming out. He arms himself with two kitchen knifes and he gets a hold of a broomstick and makes a spear. 'This continues for some time, both defendants behave in an aggressive and threatening way from 12.30am until 6.30am.' Ian O'Rourke, defending, said the only explanation they offered for the break-in when they finally surrendered was that they 'fancied a piece of quiche.' He added: 'That remark was picked up by the media and this case attracted a lot of publicity. They have had the mickey taken out of them. 'It is not something that was planned in any way, in fact it is something that was carried out under the nose of the police. Of course the offence was aggravated by the fact that both of them took drink and drugs on that night.' Hungry: After their arrest, the burglars claimed that they only 'fancied a piece of quiche' (file photo) Recorder Paul Camp told Kirsopp: 'You made a spear out out of a broomstick and held out from 12.30am to 6.30am in the morning. 'I think the picture that emerges is someone who without drink is a hard working, reasonable man. The combination of drink and drugs turns you into a very different person.' He told Thompson: 'You played the lesser part in this affray. Although you did not arm yourself, you are jointly responsible and there is not much difference in terms of responsibility.' Kirsopp was sentenced to an additional 40 weeks in jail for breaching a previous suspended sentence imposed when he was convicted of burglary. After the incident in August, Howard Marshall, co-owner of the cafe, said: 'We were called out at one o'clock in the morning by police. 'The burglars had got in to our cafe through the back window and trashed the place. They grabbed the kitchen knives and were refusing to come out. 'They left the cakes and ate the quiche. They also found a bottle of wine which we used for cooking.'","Barry Kirsopp, 21, and Dean Thompson, 20, both refused to leave the cafe .

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Peter Humphrey and Yingzeng Yu appeared on China's central broadcaster CNTV apparently admitting to illegally gathering personal information on individuals in China . According to The Times, they appeared on television in handcuffs and wearing orange vests, with their faces blurred, after police announced the arrest of the two corporate investigators who work in Shanghai, on charges of improperly selling personal information about Chinese citizens. In the broadcast Humphrey says: 'To obtain this information, I sometimes used illegal means. 'I want to apologize to the Chinese government.' James Zimmerman, managing partner of the Beijing office of the law firm Sheppard Mullin Richter & Hampton, said: 'The opaque nature of the investigation . and detention of the Humphreys is troubling at best and puts a serious . chilling effect on legitimate efforts to investigate even benign, public . information.' Several dozen reports prepared by Humphrey and Yu for corporate clients contained information that 'seriously violated the legitimate rights of citizens,' the Shanghai police department said in a statement. It said they were formally arrested on August 16. That included home addresses and information on family members, real estate and vehicles, the statement said. It said they were sold to clients including manufacturers, law firms and financial institutions. The arrests coincided with the announcement of an investigation into possible bribery of doctors by GlaxoSmithKline employees, prompting suggestions their case might be linked, but today's announcement made no mention of that . Humphrey's and Yu's firm, ChinaWhys Ltd., says on its website it 'specializes in discreet risk mitigation solutions, consulting and investigation services' aimed at 'walking multinationals through the labyrinth of opportunity, risk and unfamiliar cultural environment.' Humphrey, a former reporter for the Reuters news agency, has worked as an investigator for the past 14 years in Asia, focusing on white-collar crime prevention, fraud investigation and crisis mitigation, according to the website. It says Yu has worked for or advised companies in the United States, Hong Kong and China in technology, medical products and other industries over a 25-year business career. 'The opaque nature of the investigation . and detention of the Humphreys is troubling at best and puts a serious . chilling effect on legitimate efforts to investigate even benign, public . information' - James Zimmerman, of Sheppard Mullin Richter & Hampton . Humphrey and Yu are accused of paying £80 to £200 per item of personal information, the official Xinhua News Agency said. The British Embassy in Beijing confirmed last week that Humphrey was arrested but gave no details of charges. The embassy said it was providing unspecified consular assistance to his family. The American Embassy in Beijing said earlier that diplomats visited Yu on July 16. A spokesman said he had no additional information. The detentions coincided with the announcement in July of an investigation into possible bribery of doctors by employees of pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline. That prompted suggestions their case might be linked to Glaxo, but today's announcement made no mention of that. The announcement said Shanghai police are investigating 126 people on suspicion of improperly gathering personal information and have detained 35. Chinese companies have reacted angrily to disclosures of information by investigators. In the highest-profile case, a U.S. firm, Muddy Waters Research, accused Chinese forestry company Sino-Forest Corp. of exaggerating the value of its assets. Sino-Forest's shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange plunged in value. Canadian police launched an investigation of the company, which filed a lawsuit accusing Muddy Waters of defamation.","Peter Humphrey and Yingzeng Yu's 'confession' broadcast on Chinese TV .

The former fiance of singer Amy Winehouse raped a friend as she slept and then told her: ‘I always wanted to do this to you’, a court heard yesterday. Film director Reg Traviss, 35, attacked the fashion designer, a friend of five years, twice in his flat after a drunken night out, it was alleged. After the attack he told her he was going to keep her underwear, it was claimed. Scroll down for video . Couple: Amy Winehouse and Reg Traviss in June 2010 in London. He appeared in court today on two counts of raping a female friend of his last year . Traviss had been in a relationship . with Miss Winehouse from early 2010 and they were planning to marry when . she died of alcohol poisoning in July 2011 aged 27. The alleged attack took place six . months later on December 30, after Traviss and the designer drank . cocktails in three central London bars. Reg Traviss arrives at Southwark Crown Court. He is accused of twice raping a woman at his flat on December 30 2011 . At the end of the night the woman was . allegedly too drunk to stand. Traviss  persuaded her to go back to his . flat in Marylebone, it was said. The victim claims this was the last . thing she remembered before waking up to him raping her. Traviss then . stopped when she asked him to and offered her a drink. After drinking a glass of wine the . woman passed out again. She then woke up to find him raping her for a . second time, Southwark Crown Court was told. She said she remembered drifting in . and out of consciousness and hearing Traviss say: ‘Oh, I always wanted . to do this to you.’ She later told police: ‘It felt just like a bad . dream.’ Katherine Lumsdon, prosecuting, told the jury: ‘She said she would not have consented to sex even if she had been conscious.’ Miss Lumsdon told the jury that the pair drank cocktails, several rum and coke drinks and shots during their night out. The prosecutor added: ‘She asked Reg . to put her in a cab so that she could go home. He suggested she stay at . his as it was closer. She was also aware that a black cab was unlikely . to take her as she couldn’t stand. ‘She remembers him asking, “Would you like to stay at mine?” She does not remember her reply, but assumes she said yes. ‘That’s the last thing she remembers before waking up in his bed.’ Couple: Traviss and girlfriend Amy Winehouse arriving for the premiere of his film Psychosis in July 2010 . She realised what was happening, asked what he was doing and told him to stop. ‘He stopped. She was very shocked,’ said Miss Lumsdon. ‘She could not process what had happened and could . hardly believe it. He was acting as if nothing had happened at all.’ The woman was ‘extremely weak’ and . was unable to get out of bed until the afternoon. As she got dressed she . realised she could not find her underwear and asked Traviss if he had . seen it. Traviss allegedly replied: ‘I actually want to keep them.’ Giving evidence from behind a screen, the woman said she had thought Traviss would be sleeping on the sofa. Accused: Traviss (pictured right outside the north London home of Amy Winehouse where she was found dead last year) denies the charges and claims the sex was consensual . She said: ‘I remember waking up in his bed and he was having sex with me. I couldn’t understand what was going on. ‘I fell asleep again and I woke up to . him doing the same thing to me. At that point I was so tired. I had . this blurry understanding of what was happening. ‘I wasn’t sure if it was a dream or if it was happening and I passed out again. ‘I did not expect it to happen. I did not want to have sex with him. ‘I don’t fancy him and I would not have said yes if I was sober.’ Traviss was dating singer Amy Winehouse before she died last year aged 27 . She said that Traviss had been . someone she saw a few times a year but after Miss Winehouse’s death she . decided to spend more time with him. ‘His ex-girlfriend had just died. He . was quite shattered and distressed and I felt bad for not spending more . time with him,’ she said. The court heard that at the time the . woman did not understand ‘the full scale of what had happened to her’ and did not give police a full account until February. Traviss was . arrested on April 5. In a police interview he disputed her account, claiming she was only ‘seven out of ten’ drunk and that the sex was consensual. Traviss denies two counts of rape. The trial continues.

A deputy Pennsylvania attorney and his wife have been arrested after their two adopted Ethiopian children were found starved and beaten to near death according to police. Deputy Attorney General Douglas Barbour and his wife, Kristen were arraigned today after their 6-year-old boy was found malnourished with skin lesions and the 18-month-old girl having multiple skull fractures and being possibly permanently blind. A doctor has recommended that the children have no contact with their parents, particularly the girl who was said could be injured again or die if she remains with the Barbours, according to court documents. Scroll down for video . Inside: This is the home where police say Pennsylvania attorney Douglas Barbour and his wife Kristen abused their 6-year-old boy and 18-month-old girl . Allegheny County police said they began an investigation after the children saw a doctor on Sept. 14 and the boy was admitted to the hospital. The girl was found with five bone fractures from separate incidents and is feared going permanently blind from her injuries, KDKA reports. Douglas Barbour, 33, and Kristen Barbour, 30, face charges of aggravated assault stemming from their daughter's treatment and endangering the welfare of children related to both the girl and boy. Douglas Barbour also faces a simple assault charge related to his son's condition. Treatment: A play set is seen outside the couple's home though inside police say the parents starved their son and physically harmed their daughter . Chris Capozzi, a lawyer representing the Barbours, declined comment when the arrests were announced on Thursday. He did not immediately return a call from The Associated Press on Friday after details emerged from court documents following the couple's arraignment. Both children, whose names were not released, went to Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh on Sept. 14 after the boy was taken to an urgent care center for hypothermia, rapid breathing and skin lesions, which a doctor later determined were caused by lengthy exposure to urine, court documents say. The boy was admitted to the hospital. The girl was having difficulty breathing and her eyes were rolling back in her head; Dr. Rachel Berger found the toddler had multiple head fractures in various stages of healing, the documents say. Suspended: Douglas Barbour has since been suspended from his job, his office pictured, and without pay according to Attorney General Linda Kelly . Kristen Barbour allegedly told doctors the toddler often banged her head accidentally, but Berger said the child's injuries were consistent with abuse. She is the one who recommended to police that the children have no contact with their parents who according to KDKA adopted them in March through a church organization. The boy weighed 47 pounds when he came to the U.S. from Ethiopia in March but 37.5 pounds when he was admitted to the hospital, police said. He gained nearly seven pounds during a six-day hospital stay, Berger told police. When Douglas Barbour was told his son's body temperature was 93.6 degrees, he reportedly asked: 'Would that be from being in the bathroom, cold, wet and naked for an hour?' Officials who questioned the boy were told he was forced to eat his meals in the bathroom or sometimes stand there in the dark if he soiled his pants. Attorney General Linda Kelly said Douglas Barbour has been suspended without pay. 'Our thoughts are with the children, and the Office of Attorney General will cooperate fully with this investigation,' Kelly said. The Franklin Park couple are scheduled for an Oct. 9 preliminary hearing. The couple are currently out on bond.

Michael Cole killed his wife with a hammer and knife after she refused to make a suicide pact with him . A jobless husband stabbed his wife to death because he felt their life together on benefits had become meaningless. Michael Cole, 56, wanted to make a suicide pact with his 53-year-old wife Susan because all they did was watch TV. He went on to kill her with a hammer and knife when she refused. He remained with her body at their seaside home for two days before calling the police to confess, Exeter Crown Court was told. The couple were both depressed by having no work and little money to live on and felt their life had become meaningless because they spent every day at home watching daytime television. After killing his wife he tried to take his own life by taking an overdose and cutting his wrists, but survived both attempts. Cole, of Torquay, Devon, admitted murder and was jailed for life with a minimum term of 12 years and three months by Judge Francis Gilbert, QC. He told him: 'You killed your wife at your home. You had been married for 32 years and you killed her by stabbing her in the neck with a knife. You also hit her on the back of the head with a hammer. 'You called the police and told the operator you thought you had killed your wife. The police found her dead beside your bed covered by a blanket with her head in a pillow. 'In interview you were unable to give an explanation for why you had killed her but you told a nurse at hospital you had discussed both committing suicide but she would have none of it. 'You told the psychiatrist that without any cause you took the hammer from under the stairs and the knife from the kitchen and went upstairs, where you hit her head so she fell and then stabbed her in the neck. 'You tried to put her into bed and failed and instead put a pillow under her head and covered her body. 'You are 56 with no relevant convictions and you have expressed remorse which I believe to be genuine. 'It is right that you had no children and no other close relatives. There is no evidence this was premeditated or there was any ulterior motive such as financial gain.' Cole remained with her body at their seaside home for two days before calling the police to confess, Exeter Crown Court (pictured) was told . Mr Martin Meeke, QC, prosecuting, said Cole called police to his home on Thursday, March 13, and told them he had killed his wife two days earlier. He needed hospital treatment after cutting his wrist and taking an overdose but was unable to tell officers why he had killed his wife. Mr Paul Dunkels, QC, defending, said the couple had worked in the past but were both living on benefits and faced the prospect of their home being repossessed when their savings ran out. 'You killed your wife at your home. You . had been married for 32 years and you killed her by stabbing her in the . neck with a knife. You also hit her on the back of the head with a . hammer' - Judge Francis Gilbert, QC . He said: 'They both felt their lives had no worth. He says that the difference between a bad day and a good day was if there was something on television they were both interested in, usually sport. 'Their lives had become so narrow and introverted and a time came when their savings were running out. They had no income, neither were fit for work and a time came when they felt life had nothing to offer. 'The psychiatrist postulates he was overcome by his chronic feelings of hopelessness and after years of routine, exacerbated by drinking alcohol, led him to realise how futile life had become and he directed that anger towards Susan. 'There is no doubt he was depressed in the long term. He has destroyed whatever future he had and killed the only person he ever loved as man and wife.'

Government troops in the Democratic Republic of Congo are making a final push to crush the M23 rebellion which has been controlling areas  near the Ugandan border for over a year. In an attempt to quell the last of the rebel troops, the DRC army seized the insurgents' final remaining stronghold in the eastern province of North Kivu, near the Ugandan border. Exchange of gunfire between DRC government troops and the M23 rebels have been confirmed with at least one young girl caught in crossfire, locals have said. Final fight: Congolese army soldiers take cover during an assault on rebel-held Jomba, as they advance toward Bunagana, eastern Congo . The DRC government launched an offensive on the M23 rebels last week and have since been carrying out operations to eliminate rebel resistance in territory near the Ugandan border. ‘The soldiers spent the night here and then went to the front’ at dawn, a resident in the border town of Jomba said, as mortar fire could be heard in the background. A source in the UN mission in DR Congo (MONUSCO), which is helping the army, said the offensive against the M23 was in ‘the last phase’, after the army captured the main rebel base at Bunagana on Wednesday. Diehard M23 fighters, estimated at just a few hundred men, were dug in on three hills in farming territory about 50 miles north of Goma, the capital of strife-torn North Kivu province. Rolling in: Democratic Republic of the COngo government troops arrive atop a tank in Bunagana, widely considered to be the final stronghold of the M23 rebels . The DRC army (FARDC) ‘has encircled the residual M23 positions to dislodge them. The operation is under way,’ the source said. The M23, an abbreviation of The March 23 Movement, is also known as the Congolese Revolutionary Army, based in east DRC. The rebellion takes its name from a peace treaty signed between the DRC milita group National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP) and the DRC government on March 23, 2009, which saw the ethnic Tutsi former rebels incorporated into the Congolese army. In April 2012, nearly 300 soldiers, a majority of which were former members of the CNDP, turned against the government  and formed the M23 rebellion, claiming the terms of the 2009 peace treaty had not been fully implemented. The group took control of several areas in the North Kivu province, including the capital of Goma, which has a population of one million, in November 2012, holding the city for ten days. The Democratic Republic of the Congo and the UN claim that the M23 is backed by neighbouring Rwanda and Uganda, an allegation the . two countries strongly deny. Since fighting resumed on October 25, after peace talks collapsed in Uganda, no UN troops have directly taken part in the offensive, but MONUSCO has provided government forces with intelligence, reconnaissance and logistical help. After the fall of the rebel . headquarters at Bunagana, President Joseph Kabila on Wednesday again . urged the M23 fighters to ‘demobilise voluntarily’, warning that his men . would otherwise ‘make them do so by force’. Kabila said that ‘political and . diplomatic solutions’ remained on the negotiating table in Uganda's . capital Kampala, where the rival sides have held stop-start talks since . December and their representatives expressed guarded optimism. ‘The negotiations are making progress,’ M23's deputy delegation chief Roger Lumbala said at midday Thursday. ‘Maybe today, they will have finished and we can put an accord on the table to sign it.’ The conflict has displaced hundreds of thousands of people in North Kivu, a densely populated province rich in precious minerals and agricultural produce that has been a battleground for soldiers, rebels and militias for more than two decades. Red carpet welcome: Cheer from locals as the DRC army arrives in an area near the UGandan border in North Kivy where the M23 rebels have been fighting against troops since April 2012 . Joy: A DRC army soldier is welcomed with applause and gifts as the army enters Jomba, DRC, to end the 18-month insurgency . Progress: The army retook one of the last remaining strongholds of the rebels Wednesday, with fighters heading for the hills as the military sought to extinguish the M23 . Some 5,000 civilians crossed into Uganda at Bunagana between Monday and Wednesday, according to the United Nations, but on Thursday the refugees started trying to return to their homes in DR Congo. ‘This morning we crossed back to go to our fields, but soldiers told us to turn round,’ said Imelda Nyirankusi, who had eight children in tow and a baby on her back. ‘We had the impression that gunshots were getting nearer.’ Imelda said that she had fled Bunagana the previous day and then returned to Uganda after her bid to go back. The soldiers had ‘slit the throat of one of my fat cows... and eaten it, saying it was a Tutsi cow, an M23 cow,’ she added. ‘How do you want me to go home if people kill my cows and make me feel I'm not wanted?’ Imelda asked.","Democratic Republic of Congo carried out attacks on the M23 rebels .

Almost 200 secondary schools face being taken over or shut down after failing to meet basic GCSE performance targets. League tables published today reveal how 195 comprehensives have fallen short of Government ‘floor’ standards, and will be closely monitored until they improve. Nearly twice as many schools are below floor targets as last year, after the thresholds were raised to put heads and teachers under greater pressure to improve. But the Government says 56 schools which were on course to miss the targets managed to rise above them following interventions such as giving heads greater independence from councils. Scroll down for link to tables . Struggling: 195 schools are at risk after failing to reach Government GCSE standards (picture posed by models) Today’s tables give a school-by-school breakdown of results in GCSEs and A-levels taken by hundreds of thousands of teenagers this summer. They will show that only 16 per cent of pupils across the country achieved the new school leaving certificate, the English Baccalaureate, which comprises C grades or better in the core subjects of English, maths, science, humanities and languages. This marked a slight increase on last year. Schools are considered to have fallen below floor targets if they fail to help 40 per cent of pupils to C grades or better in five GCSEs including English and maths, and if pupils’ progress in the two core subjects is too slow. Last year’s floor standard was 35 per cent, alongside the progress measure. Contrast: This map shows how some areas' schools have been much more successful than others . Crackdown: Education Secretary Michael Gove has imposed new standards on schools . Schools beneath the threshold are vulnerable to being taken over by new leadership teams or turned into academies under the control of outside sponsors. Some could even face closure. Some 65 of the schools missing the standard have already been pulled out of local authority control and handed over to sponsors in a drive to raise results. It emerged last week that the Government has ordered 100 academies to submit detailed scorecards direct to Whitehall every six weeks in a bid to . This year’s GCSE results were dogged by controversy over English grades amid claims that last-minute changes to grade boundaries deliberately suppressed pupil results. One council, Suffolk, issued a press release claiming the changes ‘have had a detrimental effect on key stage four results across Suffolk schools, with even high-performing schools seeing the effect on their normally excellent results. However the Government says national results show no evidence of a so-called GSCE English ‘effect’. A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ‘These figures are further evidence of the great success of the academy programme in turning around our weakest schools – sponsored academies are improving their GCSE results five times faster than other schools. ‘They reveal the amazing power of academy sponsors to turn around under-performing schools – often schools which have been persistently sub-standard. ‘This shows we are right to continue to support the sponsored academy programme.

A two-year-old British boy has drowned in a swimming pool on holiday with his family in Tunisia. Loui Aspinall, of Wigan, Greater Manchester, died after getting into difficulties when he went into the water after eating lunch at the Houda Golf and Beach Resort in Skanes, near Monastir. But the news of his death last month on September 25 has only been revealed after holidaymakers began giving details of the tragedy in reviews of the all-inclusive hotel on the TripAdvisor website. Hotel: Loui Aspinall, of Wigan, Greater Manchester, died after getting into difficulties when he went into the water after eating lunch at the Houda Golf and Beach Resort in Skanes, near Monastir . Tragic: One witness claimed a lifeguard pulled the boy from the water at the pool and tried to revive him . British police said they wanted to speak to the tourists who posted the reviews online, with one witness claiming a lifeguard pulled the boy from the water and unsuccessfully tried to revive him. An inquest has been opened and adjourned into Loui's death in Wigan, and officers now hope the holidaymakers will give statements on what happened for a full inquest expected next year. One reviewer speculated that ‘nobody appeared to be trained in basic CPR’ and the lifeguards had been chatting to young girls, while another claimed the pools were ‘dangerously’ overcrowded. But a third holidaymaker said: ‘This was not the hotel’s fault and the lifeguards were definitely not chatting away to girls. As previous reviews have said it cannot be blamed on the hotel or the staff. ‘It is such a tragic accident but accidents can happen anywhere to anybody and it is not something that a hotel or staff can be held responsible for. ‘The lifeguards brought the little boy back to life, so if anything they should be praised not slagged off.’ Comments: The news of his death last month on September 25 was only revealed after holidaymakers began giving details of the tragedy in reviews of the all-inclusive hotel on the TripAdvisor website . Swimming pool: One reveiwer speculated that 'nobody appeared to be trained in basic CPR' at the hotel . A fourth holidaymaker said: ‘No one is to blame. The lifeguard did an amazing job, he remained calm and did exactly the correct procedure for an infant who had drowned - even though he was surrounded by people shouting and screaming at him.' Greater Manchester Police Coroner’s Officer Paul Devine said: ‘Our thoughts are with his family at this heartbreaking time. 'It is such a tragic accident but accidents can happen anywhere to anybody and it is not something that a hotel or staff can be held responsible for' Holidaymaker's review on TripAdvisor . ‘While the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has been offering support to the family, we have been asked by the coroner to appeal to anyone who may have seen this tragedy or its aftermath. ‘This is not a criminal investigation and there are no suspicious circumstances, however the family supports this request as this will help the coroner best decide the tragic circumstances that lead to the boy's death. ‘We know that there has been talk of what happened on social media and are trying to speak to anyone who claims to be a witness, but there could be several British tourists who do not know that this inquest will take place.’ A spokesman for the Houda resort did not immediately return a request for comment by MailOnline.","Loui Aspinall died at Houda Golf and Beach Resort in Skanes, Monastir .

Complaints: Fifty Shades of Grey by E L James, is fourth on the list of the most complained about books in US libraries . Erotic fiction trilogy Fifty Shades of Grey is one of the most complained about books on America's library shelves, according to a new study. E L James' multimillion selling novel is at number four on the American Library Association's annual study of 'challenged books' - works subject to complaints from parents, educators and other members of the public. The objections were for offensive language and graphic sexual content. First on the list were Dav Pilkey's Captain Underpants books, followed by Sherman Alexie's prize-winning The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian, and Jay Asher's Thirteen Reasons Why. Also on the list, at number ten, was Nobel laureate Toni Morrison's 'Beloved,' with objections raised about it being sexually explicit and violent. 'It's pretty exciting to be on a list that frequently features Mark Twain, Harper Lee, and Maya Angelou,' Mr Pilkey said in a statement. 'But I worry that some parents might see this list and discourage their kids from reading Captain Underpants, even though they have not had a chance to read the books themselves.' The library association's Office for Intellectual Freedom defines a challenge as a 'formal, written complaint filed with a library or school requesting that a book or other material be restricted or removed because of its content or appropriateness.' The office received 464 challenges last year, a jump of more 25 per cent from 2011, but still low compared to the 1980s and 90s. Exact numbers, including how many books were actually pulled, are hard to calculate. The association has long believed that for every complaint registered, four to five go unreported by libraries, and that some librarians may restrict access in anticipation of objections. Reaction: EL James' books were pulled off shelves by public libraries in Georgia, Florida and elsewhere soon after they were released . 'One reason we think the number went up in 2012 is that we made challenges easier to report by including a portal on our Web page,' said Barbara M. Jones, director of the OIF. The challenged books list was included in the library association's annual 'State of the Libraries' report which examines how libraries are responding to budget cuts and the financial advice they offer for patrons during hard economic times. (According to the American Library Association) The Fifty Shades books were released last spring and public libraries in Georgia, Florida and elsewhere soon pulled the racy romance trilogy or decided not to order the books, saying they were too steamy or too poorly written. Local library representatives at the time denounced the novels as 'semi-pornographic' and unfit for 'community standards.' But the list also included some works . highly regarded in the literary community: Morrison's Beloved, winner . of the Pulitzer Prize; Alexie's novel, a National Book Award winner; and . a book club favorite, Khaled Hosseini's The Kite Runner. The . Captain Underpants books, which Green said he is currently reading to . his three-year-old son, have long been debated among parents and . educators. Some praise the books because they encourage boys to read, . others criticize them for their toilet humor and irreverent attitude; . the title character is a superhero devised by two fourth graders about . their grouchy principal, Mr Krupp. 'I don't see these books as encouraging . disrespect for authority. Perhaps they demonstrate the value of . questioning authority,' Mr Pilkey said. 'Some of the authority figures in the Captain Underpants books are villains. They are bullies and they do vicious things.' Some famous entries from recent years have dropped off the top 10, including, J K  Rowling's Harry Potter books, Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series, Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games trilogy.","Erotic novel on American Library Association's 'challenged books' list .

Cheerios has become embroiled in a race row after it released a national television advert of an interracial family enjoying the oat-based breakfast cereal. The cereal-maker was forced to shut down the video's comment board on its site after it was inundated with a torrent of racist abuse. Some online commenters were so offended by the concept of a happy mixed-race family that they said the advert made them 'want to vomit'. The touching short features a mixed-race girl asking her white mother if Cheerios are good for the heart before running out of the kitchen when she is told that they are.

While it is now impossible to verify any of the comments submitted, AdWeek reported that the comment section contained numerous references to Nazis, 'troglodytes' and 'racial genocide'. The Huffington Post reported that some commenters on the cereal's Facebook page also said they found the commercial 'disgusting' and that it made them 'want to vomit'. One man expressed shock that a black father would stay with his family, writing: 'More like single parent in the making. Black dad will dip out soon.' A stream on Reddit went off on a debate about the accuracy or likelihood of the mixed-race family being made up of a black man and a white woman rather than a black woman and white man. Adorable: The touching short features a mixed-race girl asking her white mother if Cheerios are good for the heart before running out of the kitchen when she tells her it does . Happy with her job: Whitney Avalon plays the mom in the ad and she has been featured in 47 national commercials . Mixed race couples undoubtedly appear more often in real life than they do on television though as the 2010 Census reports that it is becoming a bigger population and may reflect in marketing trends. The census reported that nearly seven per cent of all married couple households in the United States feature partners of more than one race or ethnicity. The percentage doubles when you include unmarried co-habitating couples, as 14 per cent of those are mixed race. Others thought that it was a marketing ploy to drum up good publicity for the company rather than having any true emotional meaning behind the ad. All over the country: The 2010 Census showed that there are more mixed race couples in the western United States than in the east but there are couples throughout . 'It has nothing to do with the company, the point is some casting agency/marketing department wanted a Carl Winslow, stereotypical upper/middle class white housewife, and a mixed girl,' one Reddit user wrote. This is not the first time that Cheerios has sparked a race controversy, as a previous ad featuring two black siblings and their father received numerous racist comments. In the June 2012 spot, the older brother steals the majority of his high chair-bound sibling's cereal. 'Just goes to show you they start steeling [sic] at an early age!!! First Cheerio's next bikes then cars lol just like in real life,' one Youtube user wrote in the comments. 'Thinking outside the box is not an advertising M.O., their goal is to grab the widest audience's attention. And that demographic is generally filled with the same artards that say they're down with interracial couples as long as their offspring don't become a part of one.' However, despite the string of ugly comments made on YouTube and Facebook, many were quick to defend the advert, made by Saatchi & Saatchi in New York. Kevin . Mueller added on Facebook: 'Every tv station in the US should play your . bi-racial ad during every commercial break [...] Time to help everybody . find their way to 2013 since some are still stuck about 60 years [in . the past].

A 'graveyard of comets' has been found by astronomers in the . asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. And, to the surprise of astronomers, a number of comets in this graveyard have come back to life after being dormant for what could have been thousands or even . millions of years. The findings, by a Colombian team, contradict the . long-standing view that the main asteroid belt was once populated by thousands of comets which ultimately burned out as they aged. A number of comets in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter have come back to life after being dormant. The findings contradict the long-standing view that the main asteroid belt was once populated by thousands of comets which ultimately burned out as they aged . Over the past ten years researchers have found 12 active comets in the asteroid belt. The mystery of the reactivated comets led the Colombian team to investigate their origin. Their findings suggests that these comets came back to life after moving closer to the sun. The astronomers believe other inactive comets in the region . may flare up when a stray gravitational force from Jupiter nudges them. ‘Imagine all these asteroids going around the sun for aeons, . with no hint of activity,’ said Professor Ferrin of the University of . Anitoquia, Medellin, Colombia. The top image shows the conventional model for the asteroid belt. The middle image shows the proposed model, with a small number of active comets. The lower diagram shows how the asteroid belt might have looked in the early solar system . ‘We have found that some of these are not dead rocks after . all, but are dormant comets that may yet come back to life.’ Surprisingly, this can happen fairly easily. If nudged by . the gravitational force of Jupiter, the shape of comet orbits can change, . leading to a decrease in the minimum distance between the comet and the sun. The little extra energy they receive from the sun is then . sufficient to revive them from the graveyard. ‘These objects are the 'Lazarus comets', returning to life . after being dormant for thousands or even millions of years,’ said Professor . Ferrin. ‘Potentially any one of the many thousands of their quiet . neighbours could do the same thing.’ The new work looked at a distinct region of the . solar system, the main belt of asteroids between the orbits of Mars and . Jupiter. This volume of space contains more than 1 million objects . ranging in size from 1 m to 800 km. Comets are amongst the smallest objects in the solar system, . typically a few km across and composed of a mixture of rock and ice. If they come close to the sun, then some of the ice turns to . gas, before being swept back by the light of the sun and the solar wind to form . a characteristic tail of gas and dust. Most observed comets have highly elliptical orbits, meaning . that they only rarely approach the sun. Some of these so-called long period comets take thousands of . years to complete each orbit around our nearest star. There is also a population of about 500 short period comets, . created when long period comets pass near Jupiter and are deflected in orbits . that last anything between three and 200 years. Although uncommon events, comets also collide with the Earth . from time to time and may have helped bring water to our planet. The new work looked at a distinct region of the solar system, the main belt of asteroids between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. This volume of space contains more than 1 million objects ranging in size from 1 m to 800 km . In June, astronomers in the Netherlands observed, for the first time, what they described as a 'comet factory' around a young star.They noticed how particles around the young star grow by clumping together, solving a long-standing mystery about how dust particles in discs form comets or planets.The ‘dust trap’ was found by Nienke van der Marel, a PhD student at Leiden Observatory using the new Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA).‘It’s likely that we are looking at a kind of comet factory because the particles can grow in this dust trap up to cometary sizes of a few kilometres,’ said Marel.","Scientists believe that they have discovered a region of formerly dead comets in the asteroid belt lying between Mars and Jupiter .

Russian embassy staff and their families fled Libya today after 60 gunmen descended on the headquarters. The attackers were planning to sabotage the Russian diplomatic mission following the murder of a Libyan officer by a Russian woman in Tripoli. But the botched attempt yesterday was foiled when embassy security guards opened fire. Staff took refuge in safe rooms during the attack until Libya's foreign minister Mohammed Abdelaziz advised it was no longer safe. Scroll down for video . Attack: An estimated 60 gunmen arrived in cars at the embassy yesterday before guards opened fire . Arriving at the scene, he told the Russian ambassador that the country was 'not in a state to guarantee the security of the Russian embassy and recommended his employees leave the diplomatic mission,' a statement read. Eventually employees and their relatives were evacuated to Tunisia today. They are expected to return to Russia tomorrow. The seige has been branded as an indication that Libya is still unstable two years on from the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi. Russia, the oil-producing country's long-standing ally, is now struggling to re-stabilise energy and arms deals worth billions of pounds. After the fall of Gaddafi - who was captured and killed in October 2011 - Russia claims to have lost billions of dollars in arms deals. Refuge: Embassy staff and their families were forced to hide in safe rooms during the seige in Tripoli . Still fighting: Protesters demanding the execution of Abdullah al-Senussi, intelligence chief and brother-in-law of former leader Muammar Gaddafi, who is on trial for crimes committed during the 2011 uprising . Unrest: Russia lost billions when they were forced to withdraw oil and energy operations in Libya in 2011 . The violence prompted Russian companies, which had pumped hundreds of . millions of dollars into Libya's oil and natural gas sectors, to put . their investments on hold. The attack on the embassy occurred as a Russian delegation was planning . to visit Libya to try to put commercial relations back on track, the . head of a business council said. The Kremlin - desperate to minimise any long-term impact between the countries - has turned its focus to Tripoli, where the Russian woman, who also wounded the officer's mother, has been arrested. This is the latest in a series of attacks on Western diplomats. Clan and tribal rivalries, and Islamist groups, have flourished without a strong central government in Libya. Change: It is two years since Gaddafi was overthrown, which destabilised Russia's relationship with Libya . Security services have struggled to maintain order. On September 11 last year, al Qaeda-linked militants attacked the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, killing Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three . other Americans. Moscow-based analyst Georgy Mirsky said: 'When Gaddafi was in charge, ties (between Libya and Russia) were good. 'He was buying our weapons and there was talk of a railroad being built.

A four-year-old girl has died from internal bleeding after swallowing a button-sized lithium battery. The child, from Tewantin on the Sunshine Coast in Australia, was rushed to her local hospital around 8am Sunday morning with symptoms of stomach bleeding. Medical staff immediately airlifted the child who was in a critical condition to the Royal Brisbane Hospital where she could receive specialist treatment. But despite the best efforts of doctors, the toddler died later that afternoon. Tragedy: The four-year-old girl from Tewantin was rushed to nearby Noosa Hospital on the Sunshine Coast after swallowing the battery but later died from stomach bleeding . Susan Teerds from Kidsafe Queensland warned that parents must be vigilant in keeping the button-shaped batteries, which are found in many common household items, out of the reach of children. She told ABC radio: 'When a child swallows a battery it often gets caught in the oesophagus, around the voice box. Once it's been lodged, within an hour, it will start to burn a hole. Potentially lethal: Button-sized lithium batteries are found in many common household items such as remote controls and thermometers . 'The saliva actually starts a chemical reaction and burns a hole through the oesophagus and can keep burning a hole into the aorta, through to the spine and whatever else is there.' Kidsafe Queensland estimates that four children are taken to emergency departments across Australia with button battery-related injuries every week. Kidsafe has launched a Battery Controlled Campaign to try and make parents aware of the dangers of lithium batteries. If a child swallows a button battery, it can get stuck in the child's throat and burn through the oesophagus in as little as two hours. Repairing the damage can require feeding and breathing tubes and multiple surgeries. If the battery is swallowed completely, it will leak in the stomach, causing internal bleeding. Lithium batteries are common in toys, remotes and thermometers.","Child was rushed to Noosa Hospital on the Sunshine Coast Sunday morning .

Encouraging your teenager to walk to school can help them do better in class - especially if they're female. A study has suggested that a pupil's cognitive performance may be improved if they walk to school rather than be driven in, and girls are more likely to benefit from this than boys. The new research, published in Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, found performance at school among teenage girls who take a walk to the classroom is better than those who travel by bus or car. The study found that girls' cognitive performance may be improved if they walk to school . Females who took 15 minutes or longer to walk in . outperformed those who live in closer proximity. The University of Granada, the Autonomous University of Madrid, the University of Zaragoza and the Spanish National Research Council in Madrid embarked on the joint project and discovered the link between physical activity and performance in class. Researchers used a sample of 1,700 boys and girls aged between 13 and 18 in five Spanish cities through the Food and Assessment of the Nutritional Status of Spanish Adolescents study. The authors outlined that plasticity of the brain is greatest in teenage years. They wrote that during adolescence, 'the plasticity of the brain is greater . than at any other time of life, which makes it the opportune period to . stimulate cognitive function.' However this is also the period of life where physiscal activity declines most, too, and this is greatest in girls. Therefore researchers outlined that: 'Inactive adolescents could be missing out on a very important stimulus to improve their learning and cognitive performance.' Dr Frank Eves, a Chartered . Psychologist, suggests there are two points that urge caution about the . potentially interesting result, reported the British Psychological Society. Teenage girls who take a walk to the classroom did better in school than those who travel by bus or car . 'The . study suggests not only that active travel may be related to cognitive . performance in girls but also that greater effects may occur for . durations of 15 minutes of more,' he said. But . Dr Eves pointed out that while the improvement seemed to correlate . directly with the increased activity pre-school, circumstances . surrounding the lifestyles and upbringing of those girls that walked to . school could also have a bearing on how well the girls performed. That is to say, it is not certain that the increased activity is the sole factor in the improved results. 'The data are cross-sectional and do not allow any interpretation in terms of the direction of the effect. 'It is quite possible that parents who actively encourage their daughters to be healthy - i.e. get sufficient physical activity - also actively encourage them with their school work. Dr Eves also noted that increased walking had been seen to improve cognitive function in elderly women too. But Dr Eves says that more experimental studies are required to truly assess the benefits of walking on mental health. 'What is required is formal test of whether increased physical activity, specifically active transport to school, produces increased cognitive performance. The logistics of such a study are non-trivial. Secondly, Dr Eves questioned why there was no effect reported for boys. 'Although the authors seem to argue that girls show greater declines in physical activity during adolescence than boys, and hence are more likely to benefit, there would still be numerous boys who also could benefit,' he said. Nonetheless, he added, a new report by Dezateux and colleagues has shown that levels of physical activity are lower in girls than boys at the age of seven. Those similar gender differences have also been reported in pre-schoolers in the USA by Sallis and colleagues. 'Encouraging girls to be more physically active is a major issue,' he concluded.","The longer the students had to walk, the better their cognitive performance .

The Socialist Workers' Party 'set up a court' where they investigated an accusation from one of their members that another member had raped them. The far-left party heard that instead of reporting the grave accusation to police, a disputes committee heard 'evidence' from both the accused and the accuser, before a panel exonerated the man - known as 'Comrade Delta' - for the alleged rape. The minutes of the meeting have been revealed after furious members of the Party leaked details to a Labour Party member blogger, who posted the full account online. The Socialist Worker Party held their own committee meeting to discuss the grave allegations . Party members exonerated Comrade Delta, who had been accused of raping a female 'comrade' Revealing details show that one member said the 'party had no faith in the bourgeois court system to deliver justice', the Independent reported, and the party held its own investigation. The proceeding bears similarities to Sharia courts, which traditionally do not rely on lawyers; plaintiffs and defendants represent themselves, there no pre-trial discovery process, and there is meant to be no cross-examination of witnesses. Andy Newman, who runs the Socialist Unity blog which published the meeting's minutes, likened the proceedings to a 'sharia-style court', the newspaper reported. Minutes show that the party's dispute committee - which hands out disciplinary action if it deems it appropriate - clear Comrade Delta after hearing evidence from him and his alleged victim, a female member only identified as 'W'. The unnamed member claimed she was assaulted over a six-month period between 2008, and 2009, but did not want to go to the police - preferring the party to deal with her complaint. But six of the seven members of the panel found in favour of Comrade Delta, the Independent reported, and cleared him of her accusations. However, when the committee's findings were shared with the party at a December conference, many members were clearly unhappy with the results. One member reportedly said that the Socialist Workers' Party did not have faith in the court system to bring justice . The panel's decision was only narrowly accepted by 213 votes to 209 in a vote. One of the dispute committee's members told the conference: 'We're not a law court. 'We are here to protect the interests of the party, and to make sure that any inappropriate behaviour of any kind by comrades is dealt with, and we do that according to the politics of a revolutionary party.' The member claimed the panel had tried to support the complainant because: 'We know how the courts and the police make women, you know, try to blame women, how few rapes are reported and how few of them are successfully prosecuted.' The woman was allegedly not allowed to attend the meeting where the details were announced to the party. But one of her friends spoke on her behalf to the party. The woman said: 'The complainant is this case frequently asked to come to this session, so she could be aware of what’s being said about her, because it is her case after all. 'She was prepared to speak out so that people could hear about her experiences and learn from what’s happened here, so that it wouldn’t happen again. But she was denied that right by the CC.' The friend said that the complainant was unhappy with how her accusation had been handled. She said: 'She thought that if she put a complaint to the party that it would be dealt with in line with the party’s politics and our proud tradition on women’s liberation. Sadly her experience was quite the opposite. 'She feels that she was questioned in quite a reactionary way, and was made to answer questions on the spot as if she was the one on trial. 'She felt she was being interrogated and felt they were trying to catch her out in order to make her out to be a liar. 'She did not accept the line of questioning, saying ""they think I'm a s*** who asked for it"".' After the details were heard, a prominent member of the party - SWP journalist Tim Walker - resigned, the Independent reported. The Socialist Workers Party were unavailable to comment. The SWP describes itself as a revolutionary party, committed to socialism, internationalism and against racism, imperialism and oppression.

A woman terrified of being an overweight bride refused to set a date for her wedding until she managed to slim down. Kirsty Thomson, 26, from of Callander, Stirlingshire, weighed nearly 17 stone when she got engaged to sweetheart Lindsay McEwan. She accepted and the couple got engaged - but loathed the idea of being what she called a 'fat bride'.  Instead, Kirsty kept her fiance waiting for seven years until she was slim enough to fit into her dream dress. It took countless diets and Lindsay annually proposing to her again, asking if she was ready to tie the knot, before Kirsty finally reached her target weight. Kirsty before (l) and after (r) shedding weight and finally getting married seven years later . Now Kirsty has finally glided down the aisle to wed her beau weighing a healthy 11st 9lbs after shrinking from a size 22 to a size 10. She said: 'I refused to set a date because I didn't want to be a fat bride. 'I tried every diet but I would always start craving something and that would be the end of it. 'Lindsay has been patient and kept asking me on the same date for seven years. He's been great and very supportive.' Kirsty struggled with her weight while working as a waitress at a hotel - where Lindsay was head waiter - because food was always available in the staff accommodation. She later left the hotel and started working for a pharmacy, where one of her jobs was to offer advice on leading a healthy lifestyle. It took seven years, lots of different diets and annual repetition of proposals before they married . Husband Lindsay says he managed to stay patient because he loves her and she was definitely worth the wait . Kirsty said: 'Lindsay and I both worked in the hotel and our shifts were all over the place so we never really had the chance to cook. 'We were surrounded by a fish and chip shop, Chinese and Indian takeaways, so we just ate conveniently. It was all the wrong stuff. 'Being a waitress was an active job. I could do it but I ended up a sweaty mess and you don't want somebody like that serving your dinner. 'I've worked in a pharmacy for the past three and a half years and I have to promote healthy eating.'I was massively obese and I was suppose to give advice about that. I felt like such a hypocrite. 'Some of my friends went to dance classes but I couldn't go - even if I could do the moves, I couldn't wear the outfits. It was mortifying.

I hated going clothes shopping because there was only a few clothes shops in my town that had sizes big enough to fit me. 'I couldn't go shopping with my friends because I found it embarrassing but now I can swap clothes with them.' As a result of her dodgy diet Kirsty ballooned to a weight of 16st 9lbs. But a year after joining Scottish Slimmers she began shopping for her wedding dress and could even swap outfits with her three best friends who became her bridesmaids. Kirsty reached her target weight of 11st 9lbs just two weeks before her big day and even had to have her dress altered - because she was still losing weight. She said: 'It was perfect timing. 'I ordered my dress from an American company in April and when it arrived in June it fitted perfectly. 'But when I tried it on two weeks before the wedding it didn't fit. I had to have four inches taken in because the weight just kept falling off. Kirsty ballooned to 16st 9lbs, but joined Scottish Slimmers and later began shopping for her dress . 'It was so easy.

Guests were treated to a slap-up meal of prawns, salmon, chicken and cheesecake. The happy couple then jetted off on a romantic honeymoon to Malta and the newly-wed bride packed a bikini in her suitcase for the first time. Kirsty said: 'The honeymoon was phenomenal. All my clothes were either size 10 or size 12 and I bought my first ever bikini which I wore proudly. 'In the past I sometimes needed a seatbelt extension on the plane because it either wouldn't fasten or it would dig into me. Kirsty and her now-husband Lindsay McEwan at their wedding last month .

Warned by doctors that she was most likely suffering from the life-threatening condition preeclampsia, Kim Kardashian was forced to deal with going into premature labour on Friday night to save the life of her baby girl. With her 'blood pressure skyrocketing' and 'the baby in distress' according to Us Weekly, the pampered doyenne of reality TV was forced to grit her teeth and get on with the delivery. Brave: Kanye West is desperate to marry his girlfriend Kim Kardashian after watching her deal with the harrowing premature birth of their baby daughter at the weekend . And the 32-year-old was so brave in . dealing with the terrifying ordeal that her often absent beau, Kanye . West, 36, is now desperate to marry her as soon as possible. 'They'll start planning their next project, a wedding, sooner rather than later,' a source told People. 'He definitely wants to marry her, he hasn't left her side.' And Kim's troubles aren't over, as Radar Online are reporting that she's having trouble breast-feeding, they write: 'Kim is doing it but seems like she’s having trouble.' 'She is planning to keep trying do it for a little while longer but she may end up switching to a bottle.' Kim's friend Robin Antin, with whom . she spent the last few days of her pregnancy relaxing in the sunshine, . offered an insight into how Kim's stoic and tenacious behaviour this . weekend impressed the often lugubrious rapper. 'This was a lot to go through,' the founder of music group GRL told the magazine. Plush surroundings: The 32-year-old has taken residency in a birthing suite at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles . A gift for the new mom: Kim's best friend Brittny Gastineau stopped by the hospital Saturday afternoon bearing flowers . 'This was a lot to go through,' the founder of music group GRL told the magazine. 'I'm sure she was exhausted but she handled it like a pro.' 'Kim was scared but Kanye was more nervous,' Us Weekly reported. 'He asked a lot of questions as he paced about, they were both quite quiet.' But Kim isn't quite out of the woods . yet, doctors have warned the beauty - who is desperate to start . exercising in order to get her body back into shape - that she needs to . watch her blood pressure as hypertension can be a real issue after these . kinds of emergencies. Far away: Kanye smiled and laughed with friends at his Yeezus listening party in New York City on June 10 . Oft travelling: Promoting his new album meant a trip to Switzerland on Tuesday . A source told Us: 'After discharge she should follow up with blood pressure checks. The condition can cause problems after birth.' However, Kanye will be by Kim's side . constantly from now on to monitor the health of his partner and their . baby: 'For the next two weeks, Kim wants Kanye around 24/7,' the mole . continued. The couple will also employ the . services of a nurse for a year, according to Us who report that the . helper will wear 'a custom-made black-and-white uniform.' 'Kim is a bit freaked out, but the baby's breathing is fine,' the magazine continued. And if she's crying, she might just get sampled on one of her daddy's new tracks as Kanye has been 'really inspired by the birth,; an insider shares told Life & Style, adding: 'He's written four songs already.' West made sure he was front and centre for the birth of his first child. So close: Last week she was spotted out to lunch with friends in Studio City . The rapper had been scheduled to make . an appearance at a release party in Los Angeles for his new album . Yeezus, which is due out on Tuesday. But Kim had started feeling ill . Friday and, after having contractions, admitted herself to Cedars-Sinai . Medical Center near Bevely Hills five weeks ahead of her scheduled due . date, causing Kanye to skip out on his own party. Several of Kim's close friends, . including Scott Disick and Jonathan Cheban both attended the event and . sources said that there were whispers around the room that Kim had . already gone into labour by the time the party started. According . to sources the Stronger songwriter stayed by Kim's side through the . ordeal and refused to leave her side even as she went into full labour . - five weeks early - and had a natural birth at 1:30 a.m. on Saturday . morning. Together now: Despite spending months apart during much of her pregnancy, Kanye has been a bigger presence in Kim's life in recent weeks . Preparing for their little princess: The rapper is set to move in with Kim as they welcome their first child into the world . 'Of course, Kanye was there with Kim when she went to the hospital and had the baby,' Us Weekly reported, saying that he 'wouldn't have missed the arrival of the couple's bundle of joy for anything.' Only days earlier the two had been fielding rumours that Kanye had strayed from their relationship. Canadian model Leyla Ghobadi, 24, . told Star Magazine that she and the rapper had a fling last July that . continued for several months, but reps for both Kim and Kanye vigorously . deny the claims. While the rapper is undoubtedly happy . to be celebrating his first Father's Day, the focus on his latest album . Yeezus prevented the duo from spending much time together. The couple announced the pregnancy in December and shortly thereafter Kanye sought refuge in France to begin recording. Stylish couple: Kim showed off her bump as she and Kanye attended an event at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 7 . Kanye and Kim had been dating for eight months at that point, but have been friends for a number of years. Their lack of time together in recent weeks made headlines, with the couple's last outing together in mid-May. But . Kanye was seen making a brief appearance at Kim's baby shower, which . was filmed for her reality show, at the beginning of the month. In a lengthy interview he gave to the . New York Times to promote his forthcoming album, Kanye spoke about his . reasons for not participating in Keeping In The Kardashians, his love . for Kim and becoming a father. He said: 'I’m the type of rock star . that likes to have a girlfriend, you know? I’m the type of soul that . likes to be in love and likes to be able to focus. And that inspires . me.' 'You know, the . amount of backlash I got from it is when I decided to not be on the show . anymore. And it’s not that I have an issue with the show; I just have . an issue with the amount of backlash that I get.

First appearance: Wearing chinos, a sky-blue shirt and a hat, the legendary actor and film director stepped out in New York two days after Farrow revealed son Ronan is 'possibly' the lovechild of Ol' Blue Eyes himself . Dismissal: Barbara Sinatra (left) has responded to claims by Mia Farrow (right) that her son Ronan (right) could be her late husband's son, rather than Woody Allens. She branded the claims 'phony' Mrs Sinatra, 85, said that she had not been aware of the claims - which Farrow made in an interview with Vanity Fair - and that Ronan Farrow, now 25, had been left nothing in her late husband's estate. Ronan, a journalist and lawyer, has also dismissed his mother's claims, writing on Twitter on Wednesday: 'Listen, we're all *possibly* Frank Sinatra's son.' Farrow married Sinatra in 1966 in Las Vegas when she was 21 and he was 50. She told Vanity Fair that he was the great love of her life, and claimed: 'We never really split up'. The marriage fell apart 18 months later when she refused to drop her critically-acclaimed performance in Rosemary's Baby to star in a movie with her husband. They divorced in 1968. Together: Mia Farrow and Frank Sinatra were married in 1966, when she was 21 and he was 50. She told Vanity Fair that they never really broke up and that he was the love of her life . New life: She went on to have a long-term relationship with Woody Allen, pictured with their adopted daughter Dylan and Ronan (right) and it was believed that he was Ronan's father . Two years later, Farrow married German-Austrian pianist Andre Previn. The couple adopted three children and also had three biological children before divorcing in 1979. In 1980, Farrow started a long-term relationship with Woody Allen, although the two never lived together. Farrow became Allen's muse and starred in 13 of his films, most notable Hannah And Her Sisters in 1986. Her relationship with Allen ended in 1992 when she discovered he was having an affair with her oldest adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn, then 22. Barbara Sinatra was married to Frank Sinatra from 1976 until his death in 1998. Vanity Fair interviewed Farrow and eight of her 14 adopted and biological children for the article.

'I grew up across the table from Moses, who has cerebral palsy, and next to my sister Quincy, born of a drug-addicted inner-city mother, and Minh, who is blind,' he tells Vanity Fair. 'I could never have understood what it means to grow up blind or with cerebral palsy. I saw problems and needs, so the next thing you think is: ""O.K., what are you going to do about it?"", he adds. A strained relationship with his father doesn't seem to have held Ronan back; and he has been deemed a child prodigy. He enrolled in Bard College at the age of 11, graduating at 15, and moving on to the prestigious Yale Law School and graduating by the age of 21- a year younger than most students finish their undergraduate degree. Since leaving school, Ronan has worked as a special advisor to the State Department, specifically focusing on the youth issues in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Denial: Ronan Farrow also dismissed the claims by tweeting: 'We're all *possibly* be Frank Sinatra's son' He has lent his face and name to charitable causes for years, serving as a UNICEF spokesperson from 2001 to 2009.

Coroner Mrs Anne Hind was told at the Blackpool hearing that Nicola's cries for help could be heard but it was too dark to see her . Hours after arriving on a Caribbean island, a mother of two drowned on the beach when she became trapped in quicksand while watching the sun set. Nicola Raybone, 33, had flown out to Antigua with her son and daughter to attend her father's second marriage at a five-star resort. She met friends at one of the bars and they enjoyed a drink and a chat together. When the rest of the party left for dinner, she decided to stay behind to watch the beautiful sunset from the beach. As she walked out towards the sea near the Jolly Beach Resort she became stuck in sinking sands, an inquest was told. With the sky darkening and the waves beginning to lap around her, she began to scream for help and police were called. The inquest in Blackpool was told her terrified cries could be heard but in the failing light no one could see where she was stuck. Miss Raybone's sandals and mobile phone were discovered in the bar area of the hotel and a frantic hunt was launched by family, friends and hotel staff. Eventually her body was found close to the shoreline near the £300-a-night hotel in the resort on the western coast of the island. There are no warnings on the beach although other visitors  have reported problems with quicksand. Miss Raybone, her daughter Amy, 11, and son Dylan, 13, had been due to attend her father Kevin's beachside wedding ceremony the next day. Her uncle David Barlow said: 'She was a good swimmer  and none of this makes any  sense. She was there with her friend Becky and her kids to  celebrate her father's wedding. Nicola was the most pleasant girl I've ever met. She loved her  kids unconditionally and never once have I heard her raise her voice to anyone.' Tragedy: The mother of two was involved in helping many charities . Miss Raybone, a trained nursery nurse who had also studied criminology, had just moved into a new house in Lytham St Anne's with her partner John before travelling to Antigua in January. Recording an accident verdict, coroner Anne Hind said: 'You can imagine how frightened she was. Having arrived on holiday everyone was happy about the forthcoming marriage. 'She just took a stroll along the beach and got into difficulties in very deep sand – quicksand. It is frightening how quickly it all happened. 'Her family went to look for her but it was going dark. It was easy to sink deep into the sand. The beach sloped and it became pitch black. The tide that night was very rough and high.' Paradise isle: Just hours after landing in Antigua she became trapped just before celebrating her father's nuptials . In a joint statement read out at the inquest, Miss Raybone's relatives said: 'She loved her family so much and was so proud of her children. She was so happy when they were chosen as mascots for Blackpool FC in January 2010. 'She was involved in many charities and never one to speak ill of others. She had just moved into a new house with her partner. They were looking forward to the future together. Everyone is shocked and devastated.'","She remained trapped in the sands as the tide came in .

Pop star Demi Lovato has already signed up for the new season and will join Cowell this afternoon at the upfronts in Manhattan. And it has been reported by Radar Online that Cowell is now in talks with sizzling Mexican singer Paulina Rubio to be his third female judge. Kelly and Paulina will replace Britney Spears and LA Reid. Mr Reilly said he is dealing with changing viewing habits and lower ratings following a 2012-13 season in which American Idol ratings slipped and Fox . lost first place in the key 18-49 demographic to CBS. The ratings are down 22 percent compared to last year and Idol even suffered the humiliation of being beaten in the ratings by a rerun of CBS' The Big Bang Theory.

'I am very proud of how we forever changed television and the music industry,' said Jackson. 'It's been a life changing opportunity but I am looking forward to focusing on my company Dream Merchant 21 and other business ventures.'

When Minaj was asked by Ryan Seacrest on Thursday whether the rumours were true, the rapper answered somewhat cryptically. 'That's a million-dollar question… I have to say this all the time, but . I want people to know it's genuinely from my heart. I love the people on Idol. I genuinely do,' she told the radio presenter and Idol presenter. 'If I had to do this all over again, I would have done Idol. Because it's fun, it's laughs. It's kind of sad that what people read all the . time is only when something is negative.

The Fox singing show peaked in 2006's season five when Taylor Hicks was named American Idol and the season finale drew a whopping 36.4 million viewers. Formerly great: With Simon Cowell at the helm, American Idol would attract more than 30 million viewers for its live shows . Other contestants that season included Katharine McPhee, Kellie Pickler and Chris Daughtry. It remains the most productive season in terms of generating recording artists. American Idol recently has been struggling against other competition shows and this season may  relinquish its crown as the most popular show of its genre. Two same-week editions of NBC's The Voice and ABC's Dancing With The Stars last month drew larger audiences than Idol.

A mountain climber sent a series of desperate last texts to police saying she feared she wouldn't make the night after getting trapped in a snow cave next to her dead boyfriend's body. Nicole Sutton, 29, and her 31-year-old boyfriend Hiroki Ogawa became stranded in blizzard conditions near the top of Mt Taranaki in New Zealand. Rescuers knew exactly where they were, but gale-force winds made it almost impossible to reach them. When they were finally able to make it, they found Miss Sutton barely alive beside the body of her boyfriend, who had perished during the night. Medics fought desperate to save Miss Sutton, but she died in their arms. Early . today, their bodies were flown down from the mountain as her father, . Keith Sutton, told of the tragic series of text messages his daughter . had sent. He revealed he had sent just one to Miss Sutton, but told her to remain in touch with police to conserve her battery. ‘We . knew that Nicole didn’t think she'd survive the night based on the . texts the night before and based on her assessment, I had no reason to . think I knew any better,’ he said. ‘So . this morning (Monday), I faced the reality that our daughter wasn’t . with us - only to find out she was, and then she wasn’t.’ Several . attempts had been made to reach the couple - who had buried themselves . into a snow cave against the bitter conditions - by helicopter and by . rescue teams on foot, but the treacherous weather was against them. Finally a climbing team reached the cave, finding them close together in waist-deep snow. Mr Ogawa was dead, but Miss Sutton, who the team had heard crying out for help, was conscious.

Hardly had they reached her and she had been able to talk to them when she lapsed into unconsciousness. Several hours of medical treatment failed to save her. ‘I’m thankful that Nicole was able to speak to the searchers,’ said her father. ‘Anybody who’s a parent will know what that’s like,’ he told the New Zealand Herald. ‘But the circumstances in which that occurred, they were good circumstances, with people doing their job and doing the best they could. ‘We respect the people who have given us information about those brief moments that they had with Nicole. ‘The fact she knew that Hiroki had died was important to me because for a moment I thought maybe she didn’t know what had happened. So that was a relief to me.’ Miss Sutton and Mr Hiroki met two years ago and were said by friends to be the love of each other’s life. Miss Sutton’s parents said they expected the pair would marry.

They met after Mr Ogawa, who is from Tokyo, moved to New Zealand where began working as a tutor and lecturer in geography and earth science before beginning a research fellowship investigating the impact of sea-levels on Pacific islands. Miss Sutton, who was working with an environmental planning and design consultancy, was an accomplished skier but did not have the same climbing experience as her boyfriend. The paper reported that when the couple realised they could not make it back down the mountain,  on the west coast of the North Island safely when bad weather set in, they dug a trench in the snow, climbed in and huddled together. Mr Sutton said Mr Ogawa was an experienced mountaineer and had been up Mt Taranaki on many occasions. ‘Hiroki has done training with other people. He goes off to mountains to be in snow caves for the weekend. That’s what he does. So I’d say he’s probably done hundreds.’ A break in the weather allowed rescue teams to fly into the area by helicopter early today and winch the couple’s bodies from the mountain in an operation that took about an hour.","Nicole Sutton, 29, and Hiroki Ogawa, 31, stranded in blizzard conditions .

These stunning images may look like beautiful, psychedelic prints, but they are in fact photographs of the colourful interiors of meteorites. The space rocks are usually known for their dull exterior, but scientist Jeff Barton has shown the dazzling world beneath the grey surface. He has photographed hundreds of 4.5 billion-year-old meteorites by using a standard SLR camera and a powerful microscope to zoom in on fragments of the rocks. Scientist Jeff Barton has created a set of stunning saturated images that look like stained-glass windows, but are actually photographs of wafer thin slices of meteorites . The space rocks are usually known for their dull appearance, but Mr Barton, who is 66 and from Texas, has shown the dazzling world beneath the grey surface. The above image shows loose crystal grains in dark matrix from a thin section of Vaca Muerta meteorite. The horizontal dimension of this field of view is about 0.085 inches . When viewed from a close-up angle, the crystals inside the 0.5 by 0.9 inch slivers appear as a myriad of colours. Mr Barton captures the kaleidescope of patterns by attaching a polarising filter to his camera and affixing this to his microscope. He purchases the miniatures pieces of meteorites from collectors, who painstakingly spend hours cutting, grinding, and polishing them until they are thin enough to use. Mr Barton has photographed hundreds of thin fragments of meteorites by using a standard digital SLR camera attached to a petrographic microscope.

At Vaca Muerta in Chile, many fragments of meteorites were found, including this thin section of a Vaca Muerta meteorite. The left half of the slide, along a diagonal arc from upper left to lower right, is part of a large chondrule that has been melted. Chondrules are small, rounded particles embedded in most stony meteorites . 'I began studying thin sections of rocks and meteorites in 2004,' said Mr Barton, 66, from Texas, USA. 'I taught myself how to identify minerals in thin sections by measuring index of refraction with a microscope. 'Now I use a spectrograph and computer software, and I started taking photographs of the colourful bits in the meteorites. 'Variations in optical glass and in mounting lenses can alter the polarisation of light passing through the lenses. 'Making the photographs takes a matter of seconds to minutes, depending on how thoroughly you want to document the section and what you are trying to learn from it.' Mr Barton used variations in optical glass and in mounting lenses to alter the polarisation of light passing through the microscope creating these dazzling colours . Most meteorites, such as the one shown, are fragments of asteroids which have fallen from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The biggest meteorite that has been found on Earth weighs 60 tons and plummeted from space 80,000 years ago . 'I taught myself how to identify minerals in thin sections by measuring index of refraction with a microscope,' said Mr Barton. 'Now I use a spectrograph and computer software, and I started taking photographs of the colourful bits in the meteorites.' All the meteorites and thin sections were acquired from other collectors, who spend between two and 20 hours making them, depending on the type of material. 'The reactions I get are mostly along the lines of ""What is that?"" but I quite often get ""Wow, those are pretty""', said Mr Barton. Most meteorites are fragments of asteroids which have fallen from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. This volume of space contains more than 1 million objects ranging in size from 1m to 800km. The biggest meteorite that has been found on Earth weighs 60 tons and plummeted from space 80,000 years ago.

You stir some very deep part of my soul. Be patient with me and don't be angry with my peculiarities. I love you . very much.' Kingston University paid £107,000 for the collection, funded by a Heritage Lottery F . und grant. Dr Anne Rowe, director of the Centre for Iris Murdoch Studies, said the letters provided a rare insight into the author's private life and thoughts. She said: 'They hold particular human interest because of the intense personal relationship between the two women who first met as undergraduates at Somerville College, Oxford. 'They went through all the ups and downs of friendship together but they remained very close for six decades. In the final stages of Murdoch's illness, Philippa was one of the few people apart from Murdoch's husband with whom she could be left alone without becoming agitated.'

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 14:42 EST, 29 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:23 EST, 30 October 2013 . US officials have defended a controversial spying program during a Capitol Hill hearing, insisting that 'every nation collects foreign intelligence'. A panel including Director of National intelligence James Clapper and National Security Agency chief General Keith Alexander told a House Intelligence Committee hearing that US foreign surveillance programs are run responsibly. The hearing came as the beleaguered White House is considering ordering the NSA to stop spying on leaders of ally nations after it emerged the US has been monitoring German Chancellor Angela Merkel's communications. Protestors waving placards and wearing clown glasses with 'Stop Spying Slogans' regularly interrupted the hearing. Scroll Down for Video . Protests: NSA chief General Keith Alexander glares at a protestor who interrupts the hearing waving a protest placard and wearing glasses carrying the slogan 'Stop spying on us' Gen. Alexander said he would rather take his lumps with the public and the press than stop a program that protects Americans from future terror attacks . Three-ring circus: During a hearing on potential changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, Code Pink protesters stole the show until they were shown the door . Showdown: (L-R) NSA Deputy Director Chris Inglis, NSA Director Gen. Keith Alexander, DNI James Clapper and Deputy AG James Cole defended U.S. intelligence operations in the face of new allegations from overseas . Separately, federal lawmakers are . poised to dramatically restrict how the agency can use its vast . databases of communications records that span both the nation and the . world following the leaks from Edward Snowden. The panel faced questions against a backdrop of new charges . regarding U.S. spying on foreign leaders of friendly nations. Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican, said early on in the hearing that his committee was generally aware of the intelligence community's overseas activities, but stopped short of offering specifics about spying on foreign heads of state. Clapper acknowledged that if the NSA were surveilling foreign leaders, 'that should be reported to the committee ... in considerable detail' as a 'significant' intelligence activity over which Congress has oversight'. Silenced: A protester is escorted from the hearing room by police . Defiant: An anti-spying activist gives a peace sign as he is escorted from the hearing . Placards: U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper is pictured as protesters call for an end to alleged U.S. spying practices . Clear message: Anti-spying protestors wearing some eye-catching clothing tried their best to disrupt the hearing whenever possible . He added that 'we do only what the policymakers, writ large, have actually asked us to do.' Rogers . put down a marker as the hearing began by insisting that U.S. spying . programs are saddled with an unusual 'level of oversight, our commitment . to privacy protections, and our checks and balances on intelligence . collection.' The hearing focused on proposed changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a law that governs the procedures that government agencies must follow before they can tap foreign phone lines or otherwise snoop on foreigners' communications, usually in the name of thwarting terror attacks. 'China does not ask a FISA court for a warrant to listen to a phone call on their state-owned and censored network,' Rogers said. 'The Russian Duma does not conduct oversight on the FSB.  But America has those checks; America has those balances.' Under fire: Medea Benjamin of CodePink protests as Director of the NSA General Keith Alexander appears to wipe his brow before the hearing . Under scrutiny: Protestors could be seen in the background while General Alexander answered questions during the hearing . When Congress restricts the intelligence community's activities, Clapper said, 'we are incurring greater risks' from foreign adversaries. Gen. Alexander dispensed with his . prepared statement and spoke 'from the heart,' saying that his agency . would rather 'take the beatings' from reporters 'than ... give up a . program' that would prevent a future attack on the nation. Protester Tighe Barry with the Code Pink pressure group was reportedly arrested after he and other activists distracted members of Congress with clown-like getups demanding an end to domestic and foreign spying programs . France, Germany and Spain have complained that the NSA has engaged in snooping that goes far beyond traditional spycraft, aided by new technologies and permissive U.S. policies. A senior EU official told the Agence-France Presse news agency on Tuesday that Washington urgently needed to rebuild trust with Europe, threatening a stop to transatlantic trade talks and other initiatives. Viviane Reding, vice president of the European Commission and EU justice commissioner, said Europe's relationships with America were 'shaken and damaged' by accusations that the U.S. had spied on a cell phone belonging to German Chancellor Angela Merkel for as many as 11 years. European, she said, are increasingly feeling like they 'are not seen as partners, but as a threat.' Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy and Republcan Rep. James Sensenbrenner, the bipartisan pair who co-wrote the USA PATRIOT Act, have called for a new legislative approach to authorizing domestic  spying. '[T]he dragnet collection of millions of Americans’ phone records every day — whether they have any connection at all to terrorism — goes far beyond what Congress envisioned or intended to authorize,' they wrote in an op-ed in Politico. 'More important, we agree it must stop.' 'It is not enough to just make minor tweaks around the edges. It is time for real, substantive reform.' Their bill, the USA Freedom Act, proposes to put an end to an NSA program of wholesale collection of domestic phone records, including the dates, times and phone numbers of tens of millions of calls. The bill would also forbid the NSA from trolling its databases of overseas communications records in search of information that could identify U.S. citizens, including those who may be involved in terror plots against the American homeland. Such restrictions on American intelligence gathering would have been unheard of only a few years ago, but twelve years after the 9/11 terror attacks the environment in Washington is different. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified that changes to the FISA law would curtail the NSA's ability to protect America from future terror attacks . 'All nations do it': Director of National Intelligence James Clapper gestures as he defends US spying on foreign allies . Pause for thought: DNI Clapper looks deep in thought during the hearing in which he acknowledged that any monitoring of foreign allies should be disclosed to the hearing . And the revelations from fugitive whistle-blower Edward Snowden has lit a fire under the U.S. intelligence apparatus, forcing its leaders to defend their practices. Clapper and Alexander joined NSA deputy director John Inglis and Deputy Attorney General James Cole in Tuesday's hearing, opposing new curbs on their broad powers to sniff out lawbreakers through advanced electronic eavesdropping. President Barack Obama said he is instituting a complete review of U.S. intelligence procedures in the wake of stinging allegations that the NSA has been peeping on foreign leaders through their phones and email accounts . But the new legislation could be mooted if the White House were to reverse course and order the NSA to stand down through an executive order. The New York Times reported on Tuesday that President Obama is considering issuing such a directive, specifically in response to the uproar over charges that the NSA had spied on Merkel's cell phone. And Reuters cited an unnamed U.S. official on Tuesday in reporting that Obama has ordered the NSA to 'curtail eavesdropping on the United Nations headquarters' in New York City. Obama said Monday during a television interview on the new Fusion TV network that his administration is conducting 'a complete review of how our intelligence operates outside the country.' Noting the explosion of new technologies whose use by intelligence agencies can spiral out of control, he said he was 'initiating now a review to make sure that what they're able to do doesn't necessarily mean what they should be doing.' House Speaker John Boehner said that a top-to-bottom review of U.S. intelligence programs was warranted, given the need to temper aggressive information-gathering with the need to respect civil liberties and Americans' rights under the U.S. Constitution. 'We have to find the right balance here,' he said. 'And clearly, we're imbalanced.'
