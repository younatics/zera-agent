"By . Paul Donnelley . Lenny Henry wants the public to join his campaign to put more ethnic minorities on the screen. The former comedian has been engaged in private discussions with Ed Vaizey, the Culture minister, and senior broadcasting figures, Lord Hall, the BBC Director General and Peter Fincham, the chief executive of ITV, to discuss what he sees as a problem. Henry has been campaigning on the issue for six years and is hopeful change is imminent. He said: ‘There will be a call to arms. Nothing happens without conflict and this is our time to stop moaning to ourselves and to take the argument public.’ Campaigner: Lenny Henry wants to see more diversity on television . A meeting called by Mr Vaizey for 50 TV industry figures, including Henry, has been brought forward. Henry wants the public to force politicians to make the change. He said: ‘All of those people in the audience who watch those shows and complain that there aren’t enough black and Asian [people], and gay and women and people with disabilities and transgender… they need to start lobbying, to start writing letters, they need to start emailing. ‘At some point soon there’s going to be a campaign and we want everybody to get behind it, write letters to parliament, write letters to government, write letters to your MP and say we think it’s time there was a change.’ Henry, 55, is now probably best known to television audiences for advertising a chain of budget hotels. He first came to the public's attention in 1975 when he was a teenage impressionist on the ITV talent show New Faces, hosted by Derek Hobson. He delighted audiences with his impersonations of, among others, Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em's Frank Spencer and Liberal MP, author and TV dog food salesman Clement Freud. Henry then worked on the LWT sitcom The Fosters and joined Chris Tarrant on Tiswas. In the 1980s, Henry was given his own show by the BBC. He later starred in the BBC sitcom Chef but his television career has waned in recent years and his most regular appearance is on hotel adverts. The authoritative website imdb.com has no television credits for him this year and only two for 2013, both on chat shows. Once a TV regular, Lenry Henry first came to public prominence on the Derek Hobson-hosted talent show New Faces (right, seen impersonating Frank Spencer) in 1975. He is now best known to television viewers for advertising a chain of budget hotels . He claims that black and ethnic minority people should have money ring-fenced to make specialist programmes. Simone Pennant, the founder of the TV Collective, an organisation developed to ‘support visible diverse talent in the UK creative media industry’, said that if Henry’s plan is not acted upon then minority groups should consider boycotting the BBC’s licence fee, if plans to decriminalise it come to fruition. She said: ‘You cannot continue to invest in something you don’t get anything back from. If there’s not something on the table after those talks and Lenny Henry’s paper has not been acted on, the stance we would be taking is to launch a campaign to start boycotting the licence fee. The question is “Are we getting value for money?” – maybe it’s time we stopped paying the licence fee.’ ‘The issue of ethnic diversity is a really hot one in broadcasting at the moment,’ said Tim Dams, the editor of Televisual magazine. ‘If the licence fee is decriminalised then the BBC is going to have to work harder to ensure that it does represent every single kind of person, faith and group in the UK to make sure they and their lifestyles are reflected.’ Henry, who made a speech on diversity in television at Bafta last month, said that while he is not advocating non-payment of the licence fee, added: ‘It’s a move isn’t it?’ He said: ‘There’s a degree of black and Asian eyeballs that are moving away from terrestrial television. Broadcasters should be worried about that.’ Tory MPs Nadine Dorries and Ed Vaizey, the Culture secretary: He told The Independent: 'More must be done to improve the numbers of people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds working in film, TV and the arts' He also said he had been encouraged by his talks with Mr Vaizey and broadcasting bosses. ‘When I met Tony Hall at the BBC he said “Let’s talk at the end of April”,’ he said. ‘Tony Hall wants to be seen as leading from the front and the BBC needs to lead from the front because they’re the main game in town. If the BBC decides they are going to do something everybody’s going to follow.’ Last night, Mr Vaizey told The Independent: ‘More must be done to improve the numbers of people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds working in film, TV and the arts. Industry leaders need to be more accountable for driving up the numbers employed in their sectors. 'I met leading figures from the industry in January to facilitate a discussion on what can be done to break down the barriers that still exist. I look forward to hosting a follow-up roundtable before the summer to see what progress has been made.’ When approached by MailOnline, the BBC said that since the matter concerns the whole industry and not just the corporation, it would not be commenting on Henry's remarks. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- . The BBC has spent £120,000 redecorating two floors of its Broadcasting House headquarters – just six months after the building was opened by the Queen in June 2013. The sixth and seventh floors – home to top executives such as £244,000-a-year BBC One controller Charlotte Moore and £247,000-a-year head of drama Ben Stephenson – were refurbished with scenes and sets from the corporation’s top shows such as EastEnders. The Sun submitted a Freedom of Information request and learned that the decorating, which took place in December last year cost £60,000 per floor. BBC Director General Tony Hall at BBC Broadcasting House in London: Six months after the building was opened by the Queen, the corporation spent £120,000 decorating two floors that house the offices of highly paid executives . BBC staff said that the old look did not inspire them to create great programmes. A corporation spokesman insisted that costs were kept to ‘an absolute minimum by recycling and reusing fixtures, fittings and furniture whenever possible.’ He added that the move was part of an overhaul that ‘will deliver savings of £67m a year by 2017.’ The revelation comes on the heels of criticism by BBC star presenter Jeremy Paxman in The Guardian that the corporation is ‘smug’ and he detests much of its output . Paxman said: ‘It is smug. I . love the BBC in many ways, but at the same time it has made me loathe . aspects of it, and that’s a very odd state of affairs. ‘When . I see people being given £1million merely for walking out of the door, . when I see £100million being blown on that [digital media . initiative] thing, a stupid technical initiative like that, I start . wondering: how much longer are we going to test the public’s patience?’ Paxman's . comments make him the third high-profile BBC employee to take the . corporation to task, hot on the heels of David Dimbleby and John . Humphrys.","Culture minister hosting a roundtable with TV figures to discuss diversity .

"The robotic submarine being used in the hunt for missing Malaysain Airlines flight MH370, has completed its first full scan of seabed in the remote Indian Ocean. The U.S. Navy's Bluefin-21 underwater drone spent 16 hours at a depth of 4.5km some 2,000km west of the Australian city of Perth. Analysts are now examining the data it collected in the hope of finding any sign of the aircraft which disappeared from radar screens on March 8 with 239 people aboard. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The Bluefin-21 autonomous underwater vehicle, has completed its first successful mission in the hunt for missing MH370 . The autonomous underwater drone spent 16 hours scouring the seabed at a depth of 4.5km . The device was loaded back onto the deck of the Australian vessel Ocean Shield, where its data was downloaded before it was put back to work again . 'Bluefin-21 has searched approximately . 90 square kilometres to date and the data from its latest mission is . being analysed,' the Joint Agency Coordination Centre, the body running . the search, said in a statement. The depth of the search area is at the very limit of Bluefin-21's operational capabilities and two previous missions had to be aborted due to technical problems. A . sample taken from an oil slick in the same area, some 2,000 km (1,240 . miles) west of the Australian city of Perth, is also being analysed. Authorities believe that is the most likely area where the missing jet . hit the ocean after disappearing. A . series of 'pings' recorded earlier this month have led searchers to the . remote stretch of ocean in the belief that the signals may have come . from the plane's black box recorders. However, . with no pings received in more than a week and the black box's battery . now 10 days past its approximate expiry date, authorities are relying on . the drone. The introduction of the Bluefin marks a methodical, slower paced new phase of the search, now in its 40th day and described by the search coordinator, retired Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, as the most expensive in aviation history . A Royal New Zealand Air Force P3 Orion takes off from RAAF Pearce Airbase in Bullsbrook, on Wednesday to assist with the international search effort for missing MH370 . On Monday, the . search coordinator, retired Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, said the . air and surface search for debris would likely end in three days as the . operation shifted its focus to the largely unmapped area of ocean floor. However, . authorities said on Thursday up to 10 military aircraft, two civil . aircraft and 11 ships would still search an area totalling about 40,000 . square km. That would suggest searchers, under pressure from the . families of those on board the plane, still hold some hope of finding . floating wreckage. Australian . Prime Minister Tony Abbott was quoted by The Wall Street Journal on . Wednesday as saying that 'We believe that (underwater) search will be . completed within a week or so. If we don't find wreckage, we stop, we . regroup, we reconsider'. Asked . to clarify Abbott's comments to the newspaper, his office said he was . only suggesting that authorities may change the area being searched by . the Bluefin-21 drone, not that the search would be called off. 'They've . been looking for 40 days and haven't found anything floating yet,' Geoffrey Dell, Associate Professor of Accident Investigation and . Forensics at Central Queensland University, told the Reuters news . agency. 'You'd have to start saying there's either nothing to find or let's move elsewhere,' he said. A U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon aircraft flies out from Perth Airport, in Australia, on Wednesday to assist in the search for the missing plane . A Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) AP-3C Orion aircraft flies past the British naval ship HMS Echo in the southern Indian Ocean as they continue to search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 on Tuesday . As . well as the Bluefin-21, authorities are relying on daily modelling of . ocean currents provided by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial . Research Organisation's (CSIRO) Marine and Atmospheric Research unit, . which may give clues about how any surface debris may have dispersed. 'People . are spending a lot of their time at the moment looking at the daily . models to provide updates,' Nick Hardman-Mountford, the CSIRO's . principal marine scientist, told Reuters. 'The . winds, ocean currents, the time and cyclones passing through, they can . all have an influence on what the ocean currents are doing and the model . has to be able to capture all of this,' Hardman-Mountford said. Houston . has hinted that the search, although not yet over, may already rank as . the most expensive in aviation history, although authorities are yet to . put even an approximate price tag on it.","Bluefin-21 drone completes 16 hour mission 2,000km off Australian coast .

"By . Sami Mokbel . Follow @@SamiMokbel81_DM . Jose Mourinho accused referees of all but deciding the Premier League title after losing his 77-game unbeaten League record at Stamford Bridge with defeat by Sunderland. The Chelsea manager was furious with officials for awarding a penalty when Cesar Azpilicueta brought down Jozy Altidore and Fabio Borini, a former Chelsea striker who is at Sunderland on loan from title rivals Liverpool, made it 2-1 from the penalty spot. Mourinho blasted Dean and referee’s chief Mike Riley, aiming a sarcastic rant at the officials — even though his own assistant Rui Faria was sent off for an extraordinary rant after the spot-kick when he had to be restrained by fellow members of the back-room team. Videos: Watch Jose Mourinho's press conference, a furious Rui Faria and Gus Poyet . Wild thing: Jose Mourinho praised his players, congratulated Sunderland and launched thinly-veiled swipes at Mike Dean and Mike Riley in his post-match interview with Sky Sports . Crumpled in a heap: Jozy Altidore and Cesar Azpilicueta collided in the area with referee Mike Dean pointing to the spot . Congratulations: Chelsea players surround Mike Dean after the Wirral official awarded the game-deciding spot kick . ‘Just to . say I will not wait for your questions,’ said Mourinho. ‘I’m so sorry . about it. But in three or four points I can say everything I can say, so . I won’t waste time with the questions you will ask me. ‘The . first is to congratulate my players. They did everything they could, . playing from the first minute to the last seconds, and deserved that. Sometimes we praise the players when we win. I think it’s fair to praise . my players after the defeat. ‘Secondly, . congratulations to Sunderland. It doesn’t matter how, why or in which . way they won, they won. They won three fantastic points. I think it’s . also fair to congratulate them. ‘Third . point, I want to congratulate again Mike Dean. I think his performance . was unbelievable and I think when referees have unbelievable . performances, I think it’s fair that as managers we give them praise. So, fantastic performance. He came here with one objective. To make a . fantastic performance. And he did that. ‘And . fourth, congratulations also to Mike Riley, the referees’ boss. What . they are doing through the whole season is fantastic, especially in the . last couple of months, and in teams involved in the title race. Absolutely fantastic.’ 'Doing a great job': Mike Riley sends off Chelsea's Michael Ballack in 2006. The former Leeds official has been manager of the  Professional Game Match Officials Board since 2009 . A former Premier League referee, Riley officiated two matches in Euro 2004. Following retirement in 2009, he was appointed manager of the Professional Game Match Officials Board. He apologised to then West Brom boss Steve Clarke after a last-minute penalty awarded at Stamford Bridge denied the Baggies a famous win in November of last year. Faria’s . furious touchline outburst could leave Mourinho’s No 2 in trouble . with the Football Assciation, with the incident sure to feature in . Dean’s report tomorrow morning. To compound that, midfielder Ramires is . facing a four-game suspension himself after TV replays caught the . Brazilian aiming an elbow at Seb Larsson late in the first half. The result means Liverpool can extend their lead over Chelsea at the top to five points with victory at Norwich. It . was Mourinho’s first defeat in a home league game as Chelsea manager, . in his 78th match at Stamford Bridge. He has won 61 of those and drawn . 16. The last team to win away at Chelsea in the league were QPR back in . January 2013 (1-0). Sunderland . became only the second away side to score more than once at Stamford . Bridge in the league this season after West Brom. Down in the dumps: Mourinho reiterated his thoughts in his post-match press conference . Their . captain John O’Shea said: ‘Have a guess what the manager’s half-time . team talk was? Be the team to beat that record. What will the headlines . be in the morning now? ‘Obviously, . with the position we’re in, people are writing us off. We had the . belief that when we can play we can beat anybody. We can’t just do it . against the so-called big teams, we have to do it every week and then . we’ll get a chance. ‘The . manager deserves a lot of credit. I think Mike Dean was very brave [to . give the penalty]. We have to believe we can stay up. We’ve given . ourselves a great chance.’ Chelsea . took the lead through Samuel Eto’o in the 12th minute but Poyet’s side . equalised within six minutes after Connor Wickham capitalised on Mark . Schwarzer’s mistake. Schwarzer was deputising for first-choice Petr Cech . who was suffering with an illness. Unbelievable performance: Dean came in for some sarcastic comments after Chelsea's defeat at Stamford Bridge . And . the decisive moment arrived eight minutes from time as former Blues . striker Borini scored from the spot. He said: ‘It was three points for . the game and Chelsea were up for the league and we showed we have great . character and great belief.’ Poyet, . whose side moved to within three points of safety, admitted Sunderland . were fortunate to be awarded the match-winning penalty. ‘If it was . against me, I would have reacted the same,’ he said. ‘Emotion, key moment in the season, it could be the key moment for the title, that one. ‘When . it’s for you, you feel you can see why he gave it.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The White House has two words for those who want President Barack Obama to deport Justin Bieber: No comment. It looks like Justin Bieber won't be going back to Canada any time soon. Despite nearly 275,000 non-Beliebers who signed an Internet petition calling the Canadian-born teen idol reckless and asking Obama to revoke his green card, The White House says it's sorry to disappoint, but it won't be commenting. Scroll down for video... Making a surprise appearance: Justin turned up unannounced to perform with Chance The Rapper at the Coachella music festival in Indio, California, last weekend . Some Americans don't like him: Justin Bieber, seen here shooting a music . video in Panama, was the subject of a petition to see him be deported back to Canada . More than quarter of a million people . signed the petition which is far more than required to merit an official . response through the White House's 'We the People' program. The government promises to review a . petition once it receives more than 100,000 signatures in 30 days. The . Baby singer got that amount in only six days. The White House is citing a caveat that allows it to decline to address certain petitions. Playing it safe, President Obama's administration said: 'Sorry to disappoint, but we won’t be commenting on this one,' Haven't they enough on their plate?: The White House promises to review all petitions that receive 100,000 signatures in a month - Bieber got that amount in SIX days . But the . politicos couldn't resist getting one message across, adding: 'We’ll . leave it to others to comment on Mr. Bieber’s case, but we’re . glad you care about immigration issues. Because our current system is . broken. 'Too many employers game the system by hiring undocumented . workers, and 11 million people are living in the shadows.' They  argue that an immigration overhaul could shrink deficits by nearly $1 . trillion over two decades. The White House says that's equivalent to 12.5 billion concert tickets — or 100 billion copies of Bieber's debut album. The . petition, titled 'Deport Justin Bieber and revoke his green card,' was . launched the same day news broke about the Bieb's brush with the law. Just six days later, the petition topped 100,000 signatures, the threshold needed for a White House response. In trouble: Justin Bieber was photographed for the records by Miami Beach Police after his arrest for alleged DUI, resisting arrest and driving without a valid license on January 23 . It's official: The We The People page on the White House's website had 273,968 signatures as of Saturday morning . The petition starts, 'We the people . of the United States … would like to see the dangerous, destructive, and . drug abusing Justin Bieber deported and his green card revoked.' It also states: 'He is not only threatening the safety of our people, but he is also a terrible influence on our nation’s youth. 'We the people would like to remove Justin Bieber from our society.' Then 19, the troubled star appeared glassy-eyed when he was booked at Miami-Dade County Jail at around . 4.30am. Toxicology reports revealed he was still under the influence . of marijuana and also had Xanax in his system. The White House response took far longer than normal as requests from such petitions are usually answered in 30 days. The . Never Say Never hitmaker pleaded not guilty to charges of DUI, . resisting arrest and driving without a valid license. His trial is due . to begin on May 5 in Florida. Bieber's criminal defense attorney has denied that prosecutors have offered a plea deal in the case. Roy . Black - who defended William Kennedy Smith, Rush Limbaugh and Joe . Francis among others, says that no plea deal was offered . and his legal team is 'vigorously preparing' for the upcoming trial. Is he a Belieber?: President Obama - who welcomed the singer to his home in 2010 - is not commenting . In 2012 a petition was filed to have . Piers Morgan deported but it didn't work. He is still living in Beverly . Hills with his family. Despite Bieber's recent offenses that included a DUI, resisting arresting and driving on an expired license, he would have had to have done something much more severe, like murder, to get kicked out of the US. It was highly unlikely that the petition would eve have amounted to anything more than a bit of teasing. Bieber has already performed for Obama's two daughters Natasha and Malia - who are big fans of the star - at the White House in 2010. However, it's fair to say that Bieber has done nothing to help his public image since his run-in with the police in Florida. Not the TV attention he wanted: The pop star, then 19, appeared in a Miami court via closed circuit TV as the judge set bail at $2,500 . So much has changed in five years: The star in 2014 (left) and in 2009 (right) After holing up in a Miami rental with his father Jeremy Bieber, aged 38, and model Chantel Jeffries, aged 21, he went to Panama with his entourage to film a music video on the beach. His manager Scooter Braun as well as his mentor Usher and mother Pattie Mallette had visited the star in the tropical location urging him to get help. No comment: The White House says it¿s sorry to disappoint, but it won¿t be commenting. It¿s citing a caveat that lets the White House decline to address certain petitions .","Bieber, who is a citizen of Canada and has a performer's visa, is unlikely to face deportation .

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . Bernie Ecclestone will hand over the keys to his Formula One empire to a glamorous female lawyer while he fights criminal charges in Germany. Ecclestone is due to appear in a Munich court this Thursday at the start of a four-month trial on charges of bribing the disgraced banker Gerhard Gribkowsky in the sale of the sport to the current owners, CVC, in 2005. Discussions: Bernie Ecclestone - pictured here with Red Bull team principal Christian Horner and Donald Mackenzie at the Malaysian Grand Prix - faces up to 10 years in jail . Although the court will sit for just two days a week, Ecclestone will rely on Sacha Woodward-Hill, his chief legal officer who is little-known beyond the terraced walls of his offices in Kensington. Woodward-Hill, 44, was at Ecclestone's side when he recently appeared in a civil case in London, dressed in a series of immaculate business suits. She has been involved in every major deal of recent years and holds 17 directorships in Formula One-connected businesses that have combined assets of more than Â£4billion. Woodward-Hill is said to have a 'laser-like mind' and is implicitly trusted by Ecclestone. Looking ahead: Red Bull team principal Horner is tipped to succeed Ecclestone . 'He will rely on her more than ever while the court stuff is going on,' said one well-placed insider. 'She'll be Bernie's rock.' How Formula One will be run in the post-Ecclestone era remains uncertain. He has spoken of Red Bull's team principal Christian Horner as a possible successor, though last year he said: 'Why not a woman? 'I believe that women generally don't have such big egos and they don't need to go and play golf to close deals. They simply work harder to get the same recognition as men and, because their ego is less important, they are also less emotional in making decisions.' Finding a replacement for Ecclestone will become an immediate concern if he is found guilty in Germany. He could face up to 10 years in jail. Even if he were to escape with a multi-million pound fine, he would have to relinquish his position in accordance with European law. Ecclestone, who denies all wrongdoing, has missed this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix to prepare for the trial.","Sacha Woodward-Hill, 44, is Bernie Ecclestone's chief legal officer .

"By . Ashley Collman . The U.S. may not have come out on top in the team free skating competition on Sunday but you wouldn't be able to tell that from the look on skater Gracie Gold's face. After nailing all 11 jumps in her long program, the 18-year-old scored 129.36 - a personal best and enough to put her in second place on the individual level. Her score also helped carry the U.S. to third place overall in the first year a team event has been included in the Olympic Games. After the successful routine, Gold pumped her fist in victory and broke out in smiles. She nailed it! Gracie Gold hit every one of her 11 jumps in the team competition over the weekend in Sochi . USA: Gold's stellar performance was enough to carry the U.S. team to third place overall . Relief: Gold breathes out after her impressive long program. She scored only second to Russian phenom Julia Lipnitskaia . Look out: While the U.S. team may have come up short in earning a gold medal in the team competition, Gold's performance was a good omen for what's to come in the individual competition . Golden girl: This was the first year there has been a team skating event at the Olympics . Medal-winners: The U.S. team placed third overall in the team skating competition. Russia took the gold and Canada the silver . Gearing up: Gold will return to Austria with her coach to prepare for the individual competition set to start in nine days . Gold's earnest elation marked quite a contrast to teammate Ashley Wagner's reaction to her short-program score yesterday. Wagner came off the rink smiling as well, certain that she had just placed at the very top of the competition. But when the scores were read out, she placed fourth and wasn't impressed. Her smile turned to a frown of disgust and she turned to someone near her and said 'b******'. All smiles: Ashley Wagner of the United States celebrates in the 'kiss and cry' area during the Team Ladies Short Program at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics . Shock: Wagner reacts to her score after competing in the Figure Skating Team Ladies Short Program during day one of the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics at Iceberg Skating Palace on February 8 . 'I know roughly when I skate a good . program where the score should end up... So yeah to score that low was . very disappointing for me,' she said afterwards. 1. Russia (75) 2. Canada (65) 3. United States (60) 4. Italy (52) 5. Japan (51) Eliminated after short programs . 6. France (22) 7. China (20) 8. Germany (17) 9. Ukraine (10) 10. Great Britain (8) Wagner may feel that she's got something to prove after her selection over Mirai Nagasu sparked a backlash on social media. Nagasu . finished third at the National Championships in Boston last month while . Wagner finished in fourth place, yet it was she who was selected to the . Winter Olympic team. 'It was on my mind with the media . frenzy over the last couple of weeks that I needed to prove to myself . and everybody else that has even doubted my belonging here that I am . here to compete, to be competitive,' she told Yahoo. Her score, however, was enough to . advance the U.S. team from seventh to third place, meaning they will be . one of the top five teams to advance through to the finals on Sunday . night. It was the Russian team with star . 15-year-old Julia Lipnitskaya and veteran men's skater Evgeny . Plushenko that were the undisputed winners of the competition. Lipnitskaya pulled off such an impressive long program that she scored 12 points more than second-place Gold. That performance helped the Russians win their first gold medal of the Olympics, and it made Lipnitskaya the youngest figure skater in 78 years to win the top prize. Lipnitskaya's performance was so monumental that even Gold could hold back praise. Together: The Russians won the first gold medal of the games in the team skating competition . Jaw-dropping: 15-year-old Russian Julia Lipnitskaia wowed the audience and judges with her stellar long program, which put her 12 points above Gold . He's still got it: Despite being older than most of the figure skating competition, 31-year-old Yevgeni Plushenko pulled off a solid performance, contributing to the Russian victory . Questions: However, there are rumors that Plushenko will pull out of his individual competitions because of a hurt back . 'She's dynamite, guys,' Gold said. 'She's completely unfazed. She has no spine, but she has iron in her bones. She goes ""Ding, ding, ding. I'm not tired.""' Also pivotal to the Russian team's success was the aging Plushenko whom many thought didn't have it in him to be a competitor in his fourth Olympic Games. Despite largely not competing since the Vancouver Olympics, Plushenko pulled off a solid performance, scoring 162.20. 'It is amazing the longevity that he has had ... To do what he does here at that age after so many years coming back without much competition experience this season, I have a lot of respect for him,' said Kevin Reynolds, the Canadian skater who came in second place to Plushenko. Overall, there were good feelings between the fiercely competitive U.S. and Russian teams. After the Russian win on Sunday, President Vladimir Putin walked up to the American skaters to congratulate them on their performance.

"By . Andrew Levy . The mystery over the  appearance of envelopes stuffed with cash arriving at people’s homes deepened  yesterday when more beneficiaries came forward. Three people were known to have received the windfalls through the post, all sent second class and with the address written in the same spidery handwriting. The only link appeared to be that they live, or had lived, in the same street in Colchester. Shock: Lesley Quilter, 58, said she has been ¿going crazy¿ trying to work out who would want to send her £200 . But another three – all from different . roads in the town – have received cash. A total of £1,200 has been . handed out in the past few weeks. Dennis Barnes has had two letters – the first with £200 and the second with £100. The 75-year-old lives in Barn Hall Avenue, two miles from Wickham Road where the acts of generosity first came to light. He said: ‘It really is a mystery. There is no way of tracking it. ‘I used to work in the building  trade so I thought it could have  been an old customer but I can’t think of anyone.’ Charlie . Williams, 76, a former  soldier who moved to the garrison town in 1979 . and later became a  contracts manager, found £200 on his doormat in . Nancy Smith Close. ‘It would . be nice to find out who it is – it would put my mind at rest,’ he said. ‘I do so many favours for people and I have been told by elderly . people I’ve done bits for “When I die, I’ll leave you something”.’ Another £200 was sent to Tony Dutch, 68, of Babel Road. Doreen Neal, 86, who received the cash in £20 notes, said the only link between the three recipients was that they had all lived in the road . The . retired electrical engineer  said: ‘My real name is Anthony but the . letter was addressed to Tony, so it made me think it was someone who . knows me. ‘It definitely looks like an elderly person’s writing – I haven’t got a  clue who it is. I don’t know what  the link is.’ The . first person to receive the money was retired office worker Doreen . Neal, 86, who got £100 early last month. She lives around 50 yards away . from Lesley Quilter, 58, who was given £200. Mrs . Quilter’s brother-in-law, Peter Dowman, who was gifted £200, used to . live next door to her until 1979 when he moved to Fingringhoe, a village . a few minutes away. The mystery deepened when Mrs Quilter¿s brother-in-law, who used to live in Wickham Road, was sent £200 . Checks by the Daily Mail revealed the letters appear to have been posted somewhere in a fairly wide radius around Chelmsford. But . there appears to be no other part of the puzzle that links the . different people together, other than that they live in Colchester. Mrs . Neal said yesterday: ‘None of the new names ring a bell with me at all. I don’t think even Sherlock Holmes could solve this mystery.’ Royal Mail said that cash should not be posted using the standard delivery service.","The three recipients all live on the same road in the Essex town .

"By . Claire Bates . Contraceptives: Jabs contain the hormone progestogen and can be used every two or three months . Hundreds of girls as young as 13 are receiving contraceptive injections and implants at school, a nationwide study has revealed. School nurses have given implants or jabs to girls aged 13 to 16 more than 900 times since 2010. A further 7,400 girls aged 15 or under - and therefore under the age of consent - received the contraception at family planning clinics. Due to patient confidentiality rules, nurses are not allowed to inform parents before or after the procedure without the pupil's express permission. Implants and jabs are now offered in schools in Bristol, Berkshire, Peterborough, West Midlands, Northumbria and Country Durham according to a survey by The Daily Telegraph, using Freedom of Information laws. It could be far more widespread as many trusts said they did not record the figures, while others cited patient confidentiality. The contraceptive jab contains the hormone progestogen and can be used every two or three months. It works the same way as the pill by stopping the ovaries from releasing an egg, thickening the entrance of the cervix and thinning the lining of the womb. Critics of the scheme have warned that offering contraception to under-16s could skew a teenager's attitude to sex and hinder their development. 'Anything that trivialises or treats it as something mundane or easy, particularly for young people, is damaging their ability to grow up and to properly form a loving lasting relationship,' Anthony Seldon, master of Wellington College told The Daily Telegraph. 'It devalues sex, it makes it like an ordinary, everyday thing like going to have a McDonald's.' A breakdown of the figures revealed NHS Bristol had provided the contraceptive jab on 430 occasions to children aged 13 to 16. This included 19 jabs offered to 13 year-olds. The city has one of the highest rates of teenage pregnancy in the country. The teenage pregnancy rate in England and Wales fell to 34,633 in 2010, the lowest rate since 1969. This included 6,674 pregnancies in under-16s. However, the rate is still around twice as high as that in France and Germany. Dr Dan Poulter, the health minister said: 'Young people under the age of 16 are legally able to access contraceptive and sexual health services and any advice given will be kept confidential. 'However, the health professional must always encourage a young person to talk to their parents about their sexual health.'","School nurses have given implants or jabs to girls aged 13 to 16 more than 900 times since 2010 .

"By . Richard Hartley-parkinson . A terminally ill seven-year-old girl has returned home to die following specialist treatment in Mexico. Olivia Downie and her family, from Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, flew to the North American country earlier this month to get treatment for neuroblastoma, an aggressive form of cancer. While there, Olivia fell seriously ill and her family was told she would need expensive medical treatment on any flight home. Olivia and her family returned to Scotland on a private ambulance thanks to funding raised by people touched by her story . Peaceful: Olivia died in the early hours of Friday morning . Olivia, her mother Lauren and father Steven touched down in Aberdeen on a medical plane this lunchtime. A . charity, Families Against Neuroblastoma, has been helping the family . and set a target of £110,000 to fund their journey back to Scotland. Only last week, Mrs Downie said: 'We want her to be surrounded by friends and family that love her, not strangers. A . JustGiving page set up to raise money for her flight and medical costs . now shows over £150,000 has been donated. Olivia will go straight to . hospital. A spokesman for . Air Ambulance Worldwide, which transferred Olivia, said: 'The flight has . landed. Our indications are that the flight went well. All the reports . were that she was doing fine.' At . the weekend, online problems with NatWest bank delayed pledged funds . from appearing in the charity’s account, although FAN said the bank . worked all day to resolve the issue. The medical bill for the hospital in Mexico has now been settled. FAN . said on its Facebook page: 'Once again, thank you to everyone who has . made Olivia’s trip home a reality, we couldn’t have done it without the . generosity and spirit of the public. There had been fears that doctors in Mexico would turn Olivia's life support machine off if funding had not been raised . 'Lauren and Steven are overwhelmed by the public support, as are we. 'Now . is the time for Olivia and her family to all be together and they . appreciate that the public will want them to have this time alone and in . particular without media intrusion. 'Thank . you again from Olivia and all her family and Families Against . Neuroblastoma, we hope we will have gained some new friends and support . along the way. Thankyou.' Olivia was diagnosed in January 2009 after suffering from severe backache and tiredness. Following visits to GPs she was taken to Royal Aberdeen Children’s Hospital and diagnosed with neuroblastoma. At one point father Steven and mother Lauren, who is heavily pregnant, were told that the hospital had not received the money due to a NatWest glitch . Happier times: Olivia, before she was first diagnosed with cancer in 2009, with mother Lauren . FAN said Olivia has a tumour the size of a grapefruit in her stomach. Speaking . on north-east Scotland radio station Original 106 at the weekend, her . mother Lauren said: 'We’re terrified to lose her because at the very . least we want to have her comfortable at home and surrounded by familiar . faces. 'If we were to lose her here then had to fly her body home we would be tortured forever more and it would be the end of us. 'There’s no way we would be able to live with ourselves.' Neuroblastoma is a cancer of the nervous system and can occur anywhere in the body. Fewer than 100 children are diagnosed with it each year in the UK and most who suffer from it are younger than five-years-old. Olivia pictured at home during her battle with cancer.

"By . Sam Webb . Rewriting the medical books: Rose Bingham, with her husband Garry, who is still fighting her illness . Rose Bingham was given just six months to live after being diagnosed with cancer - but four years later she's still going strong after her nine tumours disappeared. Rose, of Stockport, Cheshire, was with husband Garry visiting their eldest son Jack, 24, in the U.S., when she was struck down with agonising head pains. She was given just six months to live after scans found nine tumours on her brain, but after treatment - including radiotherapy, chemotherapy and Herceptin - they almost miraculously disappeared and Rose has enjoyed four years her family feared she'd never see. Rose, 55, who had a five hour brain operation in December - yet was out of hospital two days later - said: 'This all started four years ago with breast cancer that spread into my brain, but I had no idea I had it in the first place. 'My advice to anyone who gets the diagnosis is don't give up and don't give in to it - you must not knuckle under, you've got to fight it. 'I call my cancer Fred - he was an obnoxious character from my past. 'When I was diagnosed and given six months my husband Garry burst into tears - I said ""what are you crying about? It's not you that has got it"".' 'I know I have a terminal condition and one day I will go, but I will fight it all the way. 'I could never just curl up. I've still done stuff with my kids and have had birthdays, Christmases and Easters with my family. 'I've lived to see my eldest son Jack get married and have had a fantastic holiday over in the U.S. only last year. 'When I was first ill, I told Jack I wanted him to get his degree - I didn't want him squawking his eyes out at my bedside. Incredible: Rose Bingham's brain scan taken in 2010 (left) showing nine tumours, then this year when they have all vanished . 'He was in the second year of his . degree at the University of South Carolina and when he got his degree, I . flew over on my own for his graduation. 'That was a great tonic for me and made me so proud, as did our youngest Connor, 19, passing his exams.' Her husband Garry, 55, a barber,  said: 'It's been an emotional rollercoaster. 'Rose . is a medical miracle and when she was first diagnosed she was so . strong. The original diagnosis was six months and Rose wanted all the . treatments. 'When they showed us the scan picture that July, I thought it . was for someone else. Unexpected: Rose and Garry Bingham celebrating another Christmas . Rose was given just six months to live after scans found nine tumours on her brain, but after treatment - including radiotherapy, chemotherapy and Herceptin - they almost miraculously disappeared . 'The initial scans showed nine tumours on her brain and then there were none. It was almost a miracle. 'The doctor asked if he could use the scans from Rose's brain as the maker of the drug were interested in what had happened as the lesions had ""all but gone"".' 'She was so incredibly brave flying over to the U.S. on her own to see Jack's graduation as I was unable to make the trip with her.

Birthday celebrations the family never expected to see: Rose with her husband and two boys . Happy times: Mrs Bingham with her son Jack and husband Garry . Dr Chittalia said: 'When I met her for the first time over four years ago, I never thought she would be alive and so well without any neurological deficit four years on from her diagnosis of having multiple brain metastases from her breast cancer. 'I first saw Rose in January 2010 when she had been transferred over from the USA with multiple brain tumours. 'We found she also had multiple bone . lesions and a tumour in her breast.

'She has always been very positive and has accepted all the various treatment recommended to her during this time with great courage and determination to do well. 'I remember clearly her original diagnostic brain scan showed at least nine cancerous deposits in her brain and following a course of radiotherapy and chemotherapy with targeted agents, these completely disappeared on a follow up scan six months later. This was incredible to see and an encouraging sign. 'I wish Rose all the best for the future and hope she has many more years to live.

"By . Katy Winter . Many little girls dream of owning their very own doll's house, complete with tiny rooms and quaint model furniture. But when one little girl asked her father for a doll's house, she was in for a long wait as the elaborate home created by her father took him more than three decades to complete. Geoffrey Walkley, 69, from Hornchurch in Essex, took 35 years to finish the project, which is a replica of the National Trust's 18th century Rainham Hall. Labour of love: Geoffrey Walkley and his daughter Sarah with the incredible doll's house that took 35 years to build . Weighing a whopping 200 pounds and costing more than Â£13,000 , it has 13 rooms over three storeys including five bedrooms, library, kitchen, dining room, marble hall and a utility room. A remote controls the individually wired light switches, six of the 14 chimneys are linked to a smoke generator, both front and back doors have a doorbell, while in a modern twist, the home includes an iPad Nano which powers the speaker in the music room. Sarah Walkley, now aged 40, was five years old when she asked her father for the doll's house on Christmas Eve 1978. 'My mum was tucking me in and I said I wanted a doll's house from Father Christmas,' explains Sarah. 'She said he had packed his sleigh and left the Arctic but she went downstairs and mentioned it to my dad and he said he was going to build one.' Devoted father Geoffrey agreed but came up with a blueprint so ambitious, Sarah says she began to lose hope of ever seeing it finished. Proud: Geoffrey based his blueprint for the impressive doll's house on a stately home six miles from his house . Sarah, now 40, with her longed for dollhouse which she though her father might never get around to completing and right, at around five years old when she first asked for one . Detailed: The drawing room contains real electric lights and a fire powered by a mini smoke generator . 'I thought it would take a few years,' says Sarah. 'Once he started it became very clear that was not going to be the case. 'By the time I got to my teenage years, it had become a bit of a running joke - I used to say, ""Will it ever get finished?"" 'As an adult I could see there was progress. My dad always said I was incredibly patient.' But the years of slow progress were about to come to an end when Geoffrey retired from his job as a city lawyer in the city in 2004. With a new role as a part-time consultant, the loving father was able to devote at least 35 hours a week to the project. Sarah, who . lives with her husband Mark, 38, an electric engineer, in their . five-bedroom home in Bromley, Kent, joked: 'Once he retired he swapped . one full time job for another full time job. He would spend every day from 10am to 4pm in his workshop' Clever: The library is decked out in dark wood and has shelves filled with books as well as a globe . Intricate: The attic contains two servant's bedrooms complete with jugs and bowls for washing . Imposing: A tiny cat sits in the main hallway of the house, which comes complete with a tiled floor . Despite the progress he was making, Sarah says there were moments when her father's temper almost got the better of him. 'There was certainly lots of times he wanted to take a hammer to it because he was annoying him,' she revealed. 'He had to stop what he was doing and come back later. 'By . the time he finished it he was probably sick of the sight of it. He did . not really appreciate it until a few weeks later when he saw it again.' The finished result, however, proved a stunning surprise. 'It's indescribable really, to spend that much of your life on one project, it's a real token of love and dedication.' Describing her friends' reactions, she added: 'They think it's absolutely amazing and a little bit eccentric. 'They . have never really seen a doll's house like it. Most people's . perceptions of a dolls house is a basic wooden Sylvanian Families house. This is a real work of art.' All there: The dining room has crystal port and wine decanters and a case of silverware waiting on the sideboard . Play: The nursery is packed with handmade toys, among them a rocking horse and a tiny Ark . She added: 'I've spent a couple of Friday nights sitting with a glass of wine and just marvelling at it.' The 42 x 39 inch house now has pride of place in her home, although she did have to hire a van to bring it home from her father's workshop. 'It took four grown adults to lift it,' explains Sarah. 'My dad was sat in the back [directing operations] with a walkie talkie.' After getting it home, the family threw a party to celebrate its arrival and give Geoffrey a chance to reflect on his achievement. 'I was desperately proud of it,' he revealed. 'I thought, ""Wow, how stunning!""' But while Geoffrey's doll's house has proved a hit with his daughter, it might be the last one built by a family member. 'My sister in law's husband said he started building one,' adds Sarah, 'but he said he may as well give up now.' Ensuite:The master bedroom has its own bathroom which comes complete with 18th century fittings . Pride of place: The house is now the centrepiece of Sarah's own home and has proved a hit with the whole family .","Geoffrey Walkley, 69, from Essex, spent 35 years building the house .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An elderly woman who insisted on smoking while wearing an oxygen mask died after her face was engulfed in flames. Margaret Woodward, 77, suffered severe burns to her face, lips, tongue and neck after the accident on November 20 last year at her home in Reeth, near Richmond, North Yorkshire. An inquest into her death at the Evolution Centre in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, heard how the pensioner used an oxygen tank to help her breathe as she suffered from chronic obstructive respiratory disease. Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary where Margaret Woodward died . But Mrs Woodward, who was a long-term smoker, had been known to continue to smoke while using the mask. Although highly concentrated oxygen is commonly used to treat diseases that impair the body's ability to take up oxygen, when it is exposed to a spark it can cause an explosion or fire. Community warden Elizabeth Lucas said: 'At around 11.10am Mrs Woodward pressed her emergency button but I couldn't work out what she was saying, other than the word oxygen. Mrs Woodward was rushed to hospital by an emergency air ambulance (file photo) She said: 'I found her sat on her bed with burns to her face, lips, tongue, left shoulder and hand. 'She said it was her fault and the oxygen had caused the fire when she had been smoking.' The inquest was told how Mrs Woodward suffered multiple cardiac arrests due to a lack of oxygen in her blood after being airlifted to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary. Sister Susan Spence, a respiratory outreach nurse, said: 'I first visited Mrs Woodward in January last year and I was concerned she was continuing to smoke. 'I was told she had been found smoking while wearing the mask, so I expressed the dangers to her and told her under no circumstances should she smoke while wearing it.' Coroner Robert Turnbull said Mrs Woodward died from respiratory tract burns. He said: 'Attempts to save Mrs Woodward were unsuccessful and she died in hospital as a consequence of burns after smoking while using oxygen. It was the result of an accident.' Mrs Woodward was a dearly loved wife of the late Charles, mum of Gary and Susan a grandmother and great-grandmother.","Margaret Woodward suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder .

"By . Binky Felstead . Hi everyone - or should I say Ciao! I was in beautiful Bologna last weekend to attend the Cosmoprof Worldwide international beauty trade fair with my nail range, Binky London. Cosmoprof Worldwide Bologna is the leading international trade show for the professional beauty and cosmetics industry, and I was very proud to be able to exhibit my products to almost 200,000 people from all over the world! SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . This week Binky visited the Cosmoprof Trade Fair in Bologna with her Binky London team. Here she shows you how to achieve the perfect UV manicure . When Mummy and I arrived, we were amazed at the sheer size of the space. It truly was a true beauty lover's paradise, with over 90,000 square metres of space dedicated to exhibitors from all corners of the beauty world: perfumery, cosmetics, beauty salons and spas, hair and of course - nails. Mummy and I also treated ourselves to a UV gel manicure while we were at Cosmoprof. Although I normally do my nails myself at home, I couldn't not take advantage of all the amazing treatments on offer at the event. I opted for a bright Balearic blue shade while Mummy went for a gorgeous pinky purple. Gel manicures are super long-lasting with a high-shine finish that doesn't chip, so for someone who's always on the go like me they're ideal. Most beauty salons offer UV gel manicures these days, but it's actually not too difficult to do it yourself at home. I'd advise investing in a decent quality UV nail lamp such as the Rio UV Professional Nail Lamp from Very.co.uk (£90 with gel kit). If you're on a budget, the EZ Gel UV Nail Lamp Dryer, £12.99 from hairtrade.com does the trick too. The Binky London team at Binky's stand at Cosmoprof . GEL MANICURE HOW-TO: . 1 - Apply SPF . First things first, always apply a hand cream with SPF over the hands and nails to protect the skin. 2 - Prepare the nails . Then move on to preparing the nails. It's vital you make sure your nails are in tip-top condition before applying any kind of polish - in particular if you're using a UV lamp - this ensures your nails stay strong and healthy, as well as making your manicure look flawless. Get rid of any residue or leftover nail polish on and around the nails using nail varnish remover and a cotton pad. Then shape the nails with a nail file, filing each nail from one direction to the other until you reach your desired shape and length. Following this, exfoliate the surface and tip of the nail with a gentle buffer. This will even out any rough ridges in the nail, leaving them super smooth and ready for the polish. Next, gently push your cuticles back with an orange stick and tidy up any excess skin around the nails with a pair of clippers. Binky's new nail polish collection is designed to give a salon finish at home . 3 - Base coat . It's vital to apply a base coat to the nails before applying UV polish, as this helps protect the nail and prolongs the wear of the colour itself. I recommend my Binky London Nail Care Base Coat, which prevents yellowing and discolouration that can build up on nails if you're a frequent nail polish user. Apply one layer of the base coat and place your hands under your UV lamp for around 30 seconds (timings may vary depending on the lamp you're using, so do check the manual before getting started!). 4 - Polish . Next, apply a layer of your gel colour of choice onto the nails - if you apply too much at once, the end result may look slightly gloopy, so keep the initial layer of polish relatively thin. Place your fingers under the lamp for around 60 seconds. When the first coat has dried, apply a second layer and repeat. It's best to do your thumbs separately so you don't risk the polish smudging. 5 - Top coat . Finally, apply a high-shine top coat to give your gel manicure that sleek, salon-style finish, as well as enhancing its longevity. Brush a layer onto nails once the colour has dried and place fingers under the lamp for 30 seconds.And there you have it - a salon-finish gel manicure from the comfort of your own home! Of course, there are a plethora of standard nail polishes you can use to create a similar high-shine, long-lasting effect on the nails if you're short on time or don't want to buy a UV lamp. Provided you prepare your nails thoroughly and enlist the help of a high-quality top coat, you can easily cheat your way to sleek, shiny talons. Here are my top picks: . Binky's top nail picks include a gorgeous purple Michael Kors colour which is Rosie Fortescue's favourite . Binky London Gel Effect Polish in Raffles Red . My gel effect polishes are designed to mimic the effects of a UV gel manicure at a single stroke of a brush. The formula offers opaque coverage that stays chip-free for up to 10 days, with a high-shine gel-like finish. Raffles Red is a charming crimson shade that works well for both day and night - classic, chic and fabulous. Binky London Gel Effect Polish in Chelsea Coral . Chelsea Coral is one of my favourite colours from my collection - for me, it's summer in a bottle! It accentuates tanned skin beautifully and adds a vibrant pop of colour to a black or white outfit. Michael Kors Glam Nail Lacquer in Envy . I always reach for this lustrous violet polish when I'm wanting to amp up the glam factor. It provides a glossy, opaque finish in just two coats - Rosie Fortescue from the show loves it just as much as I do! Dior Trianon Vernis - Haute Couleur Extreme Wear Nail Lacquer . The vibrant colours in the Dior Trianon nail collection are infused with light-reflecting particles that give nails an enchanting pearly shimmer. The formula doesn't disappoint either, providing brilliantly opaque coverage in a single coat. Dior Gel Top Coat . The secret to a super-slick manicure is a great top coat. After your polish has dried fully, apply a layer of this glossy gel-finish offering by Dior for super shiny ‘just-stepped-out-of-the-salon' nails.

"By . Laura Topham . Bill Oddie realised in 2010 he could no longer hear the soft 'seep' of a meadow pipit going over . Not being able to hear the high-pitched tweeting of birds might not matter very much to most people. But when you’re Britain’s best-known bird-lover, such hearing loss presents a rather serious problem — as Bill Oddie recently discovered. ‘I first noticed it when I was out on Hampstead Heath bird watching four years ago — because what people don’t realise is that a very high percentage of bird watching is actually bird listening,’ says Bill, who came to fame in the zany TV series The Goodies in the Seventies, but is now more closely associated with wildlife shows. ‘The first thing you do is listen and see what is singing or calling, then you track down the bird to look at it. I can recognise the call or song of most British species. ‘I was stood with a friend who said a meadow pipit was going over — it makes a soft “seep” sound — but I couldn’t hear it. My friend said the call was quite loud and I suddenly realised that my hearing had gone. I hadn’t suspected it at all before then but I went home and tested it by playing other high-pitched bird call recordings and I couldn’t hear them either.’ The discovery was a huge blow for the former BBC Springwatch presenter, 72, who lives in Hampstead, with his wife Laura, 61, and daughter Rosie, 26. ‘I was really fed up about it as I’ve always prided myself on having very keen ears,’ says Bill, who also has two elder daughters and three grandchildren. ‘But the fact is that when you get to 50 your hearing does begin to deteriorate, and it is the top frequencies that go first. A lot of people might not notice it ever, unless you happen to like listening to birds or insects — though for some time I had found it hard to isolate whoever was speaking from general crowd noise. But it is the tragic descent that age brings!’ Although Bill first noticed he had a hearing problem back in 2010, he simply ignored the issue until relatively recently. ‘I didn’t want to admit it to myself,’ he says. ‘When you get a subtle deterioration you tend to try and live with it. If your eyes are going it’s fine to have to wear glasses or lenses, but there’s a bit of stigma attached to saying you need hearing aids; it invokes the spirit of a walking stick or frame — that you’re on the way out. ‘My wife did on occasions ask me “Are you going deaf?” to which I’d reply that it might help if she could speak up. Then about six months ago I finally said to myself “For goodness sake, hearing tests are free for everyone, see if you were right about the missing frequencies” — and I was right.’ At a Specsavers hearing test, an audiologist played bird songs to investigate Bill’s concerns. ‘Rather . embarrassingly, the audiologist played an app with bird calls on it and . asked if I could hear the singing — and I had to say no, I couldn’t. He . could hear the sound but had no idea what it was, while I was the one . who would have known what the song was but couldn’t hear it.’ Bill was fitted for hearing aids in January and now wears a pair of ‘behind the ear’ aids that sit on the back of the ear. After years of putting it off, Bill had a hearing test - and was fitted with hearing aids in January . ‘Suddenly I can hear the birds of Britain again,’ he says. ‘I went out on the Heath the other day and there was a wonderful moment as I heard a meadow pipit calling, which I hadn’t done for four or five years. To be able to hear the goldcrest again is excellent too — it’s Britain’s smallest bird and has one of the quietest songs. ‘The tree creeper is another I can hear again now — it’s like a little mouse going up and down tree trunks and you nearly always hear its wispy song first; without sound it’s hard to see.’ Though Bill hadn’t noticed any other major problems, such as missing parts of conversations, he suspects he will now realise other sounds were absent too. ‘With sight loss, you know what you’re missing as it’s out of focus or distorted, but when you can’t hear you don’t know what you’re missing. If you have the slightest doubt about your hearing — even if you haven’t in fact – you should have a hearing test.’ The hearing aids are not easily visible and Bill feels no embarrassment in wearing them. ‘They are teeny weeny little things — friends have asked if I’m wearing them as they can’t see them at all,’ he says. ‘I haven’t found them difficult to get used to either; I kept falling down stairs with contact lenses as they made my eyes water. I had the same problem with varifocals, which I’ve used for several years now, as they made me feel the stairs were rising up to meet me. But these hearing aids are a doddle. ‘I don’t wear them all the time, just out in the countryside; frankly in my office I don’t need to hear. My family are pleased about my hearing aids — though I’m not sure how much they care when I come rushing in saying I can hear the goldcrest!’ Meanwhile Bill’s general health has also improved; the crippling depression which saw him admitted to psychiatric hospital in 2009 — after he was dropped from Springwatch — has abated. Although he suffers with bipolar disorder, he has not been really unwell since. ‘I’ve been fortunate enough that I’ve been absolutely fine for years now and have had a good stretch,’ he says. Bill's general health has also improved - with his crippling depression which saw him admitted to psychiatric hospital in 2009 now under control . ‘I’m still on medication — lithium for the bipolar and an antidepressant which I have been on for about ten years. It is the lithium that made the difference. ‘Once you take something like that, basically you stick with it unless you absolutely don’t need it any more. That’s the same whether it’s psychological or physical; nobody wants to be on medication but if you know it helps and is keeping you going, why give it up? I’ve got friends determined to come off whatever medication they’re on who keep causing themselves problems as they relapse — that sort of purism can be very destructive.’ Bill also tried ‘mindfulness therapy’ — a currently fashionable form of meditation said to improve mental health — but found it unhelpful. ‘Mindfulness and cognitive therapy get a lot of publicity but my brief experience of a few classes — though it’s not sold that way and you should do more — is that it really hasn’t happened for me at all,’ he says. ‘I giggle a lot.’ Yet with its focus on awareness and being in the present moment, the practice of mindfulness is not entirely dissimilar to bird watching. Could Bill’s passion for birds have helped his health? ‘Yes I think that’s true — it’s undeniable that being outdoors and having an interest in the outdoors is good for mental health in general,’ he says. ‘There’s no doubt that being involved with nature is good for you.’ Bill’s eyesight has also deteriorated with age. He progressed from reading glasses at around the age of 50 to wearing glasses full-time a decade later when long-distance vision became difficult. He now wears bifocals and uses reading glasses for close work. ‘The battle in the case of the birdwatcher is how to make glasses work well with binoculars as you have to use both,’ he says. ‘But manufacturers have become so sophisticated — now I have an extension on my binoculars that makes the eye-piece more acceptable to glasses — though I still wish I didn’t have them on rainy days when my glasses mist up.’ But for now it is being able to hear that is transforming his life. ‘People wonder what on earth I’m doing, just standing on the Heath looking up — but we’re actually listening for bird calls, especially at the moment, with the southern spring migrants. It’s a lovely feeling; spring will now not go racing by without me hearing it.’ Bill Oddie is encouraging people to have regular hearing tests, for information go to: specsavers.co.uk/hearing. Bill’s online bird call hearing check will be launching late spring.","Bill Oddie, 72, first realised he had a hearing problem in 2010 .

"By . Emma Innes . It covered cars in a fine layer of dust carried 1,500 miles from the Sahara desert and prevented David Cameron taking his early morning jog. Now experts have revealed that the freak weather conditions, which left parts of the country under a smoggy haze earlier this month, also triggered a record surge in demand for hay fever treatments. Pharmacists saw demand for products including antihistamine tablets, nose sprays and eye drops, increase by 84 per cent in the first week of April when compared to the same week in 2013. Sales of hay fever treatments soared in the first week of April while parts of the UK were blanketed in smog and Saharan dust. Image shows the smog over London on April 2 . Although warmer weather meant sales had already risen by 42 per cent and 49 per cent over the previous two weeks, they surged when the smog cloud was at its peak. People with asthma, hay fever and breathing problems particularly suffered in the smoggy conditions, according to aeroallergen and agricultural air quality researcher at the University of Worcester, Dr Carsten Skjøth. He said: ‘It's common to have the air pollution and pollen at this time of year but it's very unusual to have the cocktail with the dust as well.’ As a result, he believed many hay fever sufferers experienced more severe symptoms than usual – which will come as no surprise to millions of people who have been sneezing and sniffing as the hay fever season gets under way. According to advice issued by the charity Allergy UK, the smog also coincided with the birch pollen season to provide the perfect storm for hay fever sufferers. The charity said: ‘The weather patterns resulted in high pollution together with dust from the Sahara. Sales of antihistamines were 84 per cent higher during the first week of April this year than during the same week in 2013. Image shows London's Tower Bridge in the smog on April 3 . ‘In addition, we’ve seen the start of the birch pollen season with high and very high counts in the South of England and the Midlands. ‘This combination may have an impact on those with asthma, hay fever and other respiratory problems.’ When the smog cloud hit Britain, the worst affected areas for pollution levels were in the capital and South East England, both given the maximum level of 10, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). These regions also saw the highest demand for hay fever treatments from ChemistDirect over the same period, with sales rising by 25 per cent in London, and 12 per cent in the South East of England. Experts believe people with hay fever, asthma and other breathing problems suffered the most while the air quality was poor . The elevated pollution levels were the result of a combination of light south-easterly winds, continental air flow, a mix of traffic and power station emissions and dust which was blown up from the Sahara desert. In effect this created a ‘lid’ on the air at ground level so pollens were released and were unable to escape into the upper atmosphere. Instead, they were concentrated at lower levels where they cause the most problems for hay fever sufferers. The Defra Daily Air Quality Index hit the top level of 10 on April 1 in parts of East Anglia and the South East. This is calculated by measuring pollutants – ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and tiny particulate matter known as PM10 and PM 2.5. Omar El-Gohary, ChemistDirect Superintendent Pharmacist, said many people with pre-existing health conditions such as asthma and hay fever found that their symptoms were aggravated by the recent weather conditions. ‘Hay fever sufferers usually need to pre-empt when their symptoms begin and start taking medication as early as possible, but this year many people were caught by surprise as they were affected earlier than usual,’ he said. As well as managing symptoms through tablets and sprays for the eyes and nose, Mr El-Gohary also recommends sufferers take part in regular exercise and improve their diet with more fruit and vegetables. But he warned sufferers to avoid apples, tomatoes and melons, and to reduce their alcohol intake, which can make symptoms worse.","Antihistamine sales were 84% higher in the first week of April this year than in the same week last year due to the freak weather conditions .

"By . Andrew Levy . 'Blue-eyed angel': Tahlia Raven suffered a rare and fatal reaction to the common childhood bug . Smiling and bright-eyed, little Tahlia Raven looks the picture of health. But shortly after this photo was taken, she died from a common childhood bug normally so benign that it goes completely unnoticed in a third of cases. Just a day earlier Tahlia had been playing outside in the sunshine with her sister Annaliese, five, and there was nothing to suggest she was unwell. The bug, commonly called the slapped cheek virus because of the bright red flush it can trigger on the face, is caught by more than half of children. Tahlia’s rare reaction meant she became only the fourth child to die from the virus in the UK in the past eight years. It was only following a post-mortem examination that the three-year-old was found to have had the bug, also known as  parvovirus. The airborne virus is spread in the same way as cold or flu viruses and is most prevalent in six- to ten-year-olds. After an inquest her grief-stricken mother, Karen Glover, spoke of her heartbreak at losing her ‘beautiful blue-eyed angel’. She said: ‘She was healthy before this. I have been told it is very common in playschools and nurseries and we don’t know why it killed her.’ The inquest in Chelmsford, Essex, heard how Ms Glover found her daughter lifeless in bed on the morning of June 2 last year. Tragic discovery: Tahlia's mother Karen Glover (left) found her daughter lifeless in bed on the morning of June 2 last year, an inquest in Chelmsford, Essex, heard. Right, Tahlia is pictured in a Tinker Bell top at three years old . Sisters: Just a day earlier Tahlia (right) had been playing outside in the sun with her older sister Annaliese (left) The post-mortem examination revealed no evidence of a range of serious conditions, including meningitis or pneumonia. She may have had a minor heart defect, although it was unclear whether this would have affected Tahlia’s ability to fight the infection. Dr Marion Malone, a specialist paediatric pathologist at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, told the hearing on Monday: ‘I have to consider all possible causes of sudden death in a previously well three-year-old child. Happier times: After the inquest Ms Glover, spoke of her heartbreak at losing her 'beautiful blue-eyed angel' Expert opinion: Dr Marion Malone, a specialist paediatric pathologist at Great Ormond Street Hospital (pictured) in London, said that, on the balance of probability, the toddler died from parvovirus, or 'slapped cheek' bug . ‘The only significant thing I did find was a very swollen brain and some inflammation of the wind pipe. I identified parvovirus from the heart and brain. It is very common in children and known as slapped cheek disease. ‘On the balance of probability, I put down the cause of death as parvovirus. This is very rare. I have not seen a case before which caused such swelling of the brain.’ Recording a verdict of death by natural causes, Essex coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray concluded: ‘Tahlia sadly died at home, a sudden and unexpected death of a little girl who seemed perfectly healthy. She clearly  was much-loved.’ Beloved: Symptoms of slapped cheek virus include a flu-like illness and the distinctive red rash on the face, which can spread to the limbs. Above, Tahlia is pictured with Annaliese (left) and at six months old (right) Ms Glover, from Southend, added the inquest had given her ‘some closure’ as she accepted nothing could have been done to save her daughter. ‘If we had gone to the doctor all they would have given us would be Calpol,’ she said. Symptoms of slapped cheek virus include a flu-like illness and the distinctive red rash on the face, which can spread to the limbs. The only risk group is pregnant women as there is a risk of miscarriage. There is no vaccine, as the virus usually only lasts a few days.","Tahlia Ravens, three, found lifeless in bed by mother on June 2 last year .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . When a bite on Connie McAughey's leg became black and swollen, her mother Hayley Williams assumed she was suffering from an allergic reaction. But the chain of events that followed led to three-year-old Connie being diagnosed with cancer. A worried Ms Williams, 25, took her daughter to the GP after the mosquito bite she'd received on holiday turned black. Connie McAughey, three, was diagnosed with leukaemia after a mosquito bite on her leg turned black . It is thought Connie's bite (pictured) went black because the leukaemia had weakened her immune system . She expected the doctor to prescribe antihistamines, but he became concerned by her condition and sent her to hospital for tests. As a result, she was diagnosed with the early stages of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Her consultant, Dr Mark Velangi, consultant paediatric haematologist at Birmingham Children's Hospital explained: 'With Connie's type of leukaemia it is high risk and infections . can also spread very quickly so the sooner diagnosis is made the better.' Fortunately, because her cancer was diagnosed in the early stages, Connie's aggressive chemotherapy treatment was successful. Just seven months after her diagnosis, the youngster, who is now four, is in remission and doctors expect her to be officially free from leukaemia by January 2016. After her diagnosis Connie quickly started a gruelling course of chemotherapy treatment . Connie's mother, Hayley Williams, took her daughter to the GP thinking her daughter had had an allergic reaction to the bite. Instead, the doctor referred Connie to hospital where she was diagnosed with cancer . Yesterday, her mother, a hairdresser from . Kings Norton, Birmingham, said: 'It was all very surreal - we just . couldn’t believe it. 'When I noticed the bite on holiday in Ibiza last August I just thought it was a normal bite. 'It wasn’t until the next morning when I saw it go black that I thought it wasn’t quite right. 'The GP was brilliant because we were transferred to hospital very quickly where all the tests were done. 'It turned out the bite had gone black because Connie had no immune system to fight it as her blood was so low from the cancer. Connie's cancer was caught early and she has responded well to treatment so doctors hope she will soon be free of the disease. She will continue to have regular check ups to check for relapses . Connie's mother said: 'As soon as we heard the words ""your daughter has cancer"" our world stopped' Connie (pictured having tests in hospital) should now be well enough to start school in September . 'As soon as we heard the words ""your daughter has cancer"" our world stopped. 'Once the news had settled as much as it could it was time so start being positive for Connie’s sake. You never ever think that this is ever going to happen to you or your child. 'Connie started losing her hair but she has been so brave. I think we found it harder than her. She has been really cheerful through all of it. I am so proud of her. 'Hopefully now the treatments are going down to once a month it will be fine for Connie to go back to nursery and start school in September.' She added she still couldn't believe Connie was diagnosed due to the bite. Connie (pictured shortly after her birth) will continue to have treatment until January 2016 . Connie's parents are supporting Birmingham Children's Hospital's £4 million Children's Cancer Centre Appeal . She said: 'Hopefully she will pull through all because of the insect bite raising the alarm.' Dr Velangi, added: 'When Connie came into us she was pretty fit -  even though she was lethargic - so we were able to start treatment straight away which obviously improved her chances. 'She will continue to undergo treatment every month until January 2016 and then have regular check-ups to make sure the leukaemia has not returned.' Hayley and Connie’s dad Shaun, 29, are now backing the final stage of Birmingham Children’s Hospital’s £4 million Children’s Cancer Centre Appeal. To donate to the appeal visit www.bch.org.uk . For more information on leukaemia, visit the Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research charity website. Leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. Acute leukaemia is that which progresses rapidly and aggressively. Lymphoblastic leukaemia is cancer of the lymphocytes - the white blood cells that fight viral infections. Symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia include pale skin, tiredness, breathlessness and repeated infections. It affects about 650 people a year in the UK and is the most common type of cancer in children. Approximately one in every 2,000 children will develop it. About 85 per cent of cases occur in children under the age of 15. The outlook for children with the disease is usually good - almost all children will achieve a period of remission and 85 per cent will be completely cured. The outlook for adults with the disease is less good - only 40 per cent are completely cured. Source: NHS Choices .","Connnie McAughey was bitten by a mosquito and the bite turned black .

"By . Emma Innes . An airman paralysed by a Taliban bomb has stunned doctors by taking his first steps in two years - thanks to futuristic ‘Robocop’ legs. Lance Corporal Kevin Ogilvie, 24, was told he would never walk again when his armoured vehicle hit an improvised explosive device (IED) in Afghanistan in 2012. While his colleagues suffered burns and broken bones, the father-of-one took the full force of the blast and was paralysed from the chest down. Scroll down for video . Lance Corporal Kevin Ogilvie was paralysed when an bomb exploded by his armoured vehicle in Afghanistan in September 2012. He was paralysed from the chest down and was told he would never walk again . But now, the ex-gunner has defied expectations by taking his first steps thanks to a prototype 'exo-skeleton' controlled by a joystick. Lance Corporal Ogilvie said: ‘It was really cool, but also really strange, to be walking again after so long. ‘It was weird to use, but weird in a good sense, having no feeling or control below my chest made seeing me moving even weirder.’ Lance Corporal Ogilvie, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, was critically injured while on patrol with the Scotland-based 51 Squadron, an RAF regiment, in September 2012. He was immediately evacuated home where he was met by his wife Aimee and two-year-old daughter, Grace. Doctors did not think he would make it back to the UK alive, but he soon set about defying their expectations. Lance Corporal Ogilvie has now taken his first steps for two years thanks to futuristic 'Robocop' legs . Lance Corporal Ogilvie walked using an 'exo-skeleton' controlled by a joystick . Lance Corporal Ogilvie, who was on his second tour of duty in Afghanistan, in a ground-based role securing airfields, said: ‘I was six weeks lying on my front in a hospital bed. ‘I wasn't allowed to move at all because my spine was so badly broken - I thought I would go mad with boredom. ‘When they eventually brought me a wheelchair I can't explain just how eager I was to get into it and get about again. ‘At first, I thought the world had ended. It really knocked my self-confidence. The Lance Corporal (pictured with his brother, Ali) was not expected to survive after the bomb blast . Lance Corporal Ogilvie said: 'It was really cool, but also really strange, to be walking again after so long' ‘But I think my experiences have changed me for the better. You realise what is important in life and I've been able to spend more time with my family than I ever could before.’ The futuristic bionic 'exo-skeleton' is a prototype made by New Zealand-based company Rex Bionics and while it is still in development, it is thought Lance Corporal Ogilvie could be using it full-time in a few years. It is strapped tightly to his legs and around his waist and moves his legs as he moves the joystick to control the speed and direction of movement. His father Phil, 62, said: ‘The device is still in the development stage but it's hoped that in four or five years it will be fully operational. ‘Kevin thinks it is just great, he says he feels like Robocop when he uses it. The 'exo-skeleton' is only a prototype but Lance Corporal Ogilvie hopes he will eventually be able to use it full-time when it is fully operational and available . ‘There is definitely hope on the horizon.’ The family are hoping to raise £10,000 to thank the RAF Benevolent Fund and the Soldiers' and Sailors' Families Association, who helped Lance Corporal Ogilvie through his darkest days. He said: ‘You hear about these charities as a serviceman, but you never really appreciate the phenomenal help they provide until you need it. ‘They helped me and my family so much I want to do everything I can for them in return.’ To donate go to www.ogilviefundraising.co.uk .","Lance Corporal Kevin Ogilvie, 24, was hit by an IED in September 2012 .

"By . Erin Dean . Josi . McLarty was just eight years old when she started to develop agonising . headaches. Each time she suffered six or so hours of intense pain and . would often be sick. 'The first time it happened was horrendous,' says Josi's mother, Alma Walker. 'It was terrible seeing her suffer.' She . took her to the doctor, who said she had a stomach bug - but the . problem kept returning, at first every six weeks but eventually once or . twice a week. Yet during three more visits to the doctor over 18 months, . Alma was told it was another stomach bug or a virus. Ten year old Josi Walker from Killin, Stirlingshire suffered from migraines for more than two years . 'The doctors just . kept saying it must be a bug when we knew it wasn't,' says Alma, 47, a . full-time mother. It took the arrival of a new GP to notice that . Josi, now ten, was suffering from migraines. Her mother admits: 'I never . thought about a child having a migraine.' Many people believe . migraines to be mainly an adult condition, but Josi is one of the 10 per . cent of children who suffer from them. In fact, migraine can even . strike young babies. The charity Migraine Action says it has had reports . of infants of four months with symptoms of sudden, short-lived . paralysis of eye muscles, face or one of the limbs - warning signs of . the onset of a migraine attack. For many migraine sufferers, the main . feature is a thumping headache. Some experience an aura beforehand, . during which they have visual disturbances, aches in the neck and . shoulders, sensitivity to light, sound and smells, and a drop in energy. Others have no headache but suffer the other symptoms. Most children . with migraine will have a headache. Around 90 per cent will also feel . sick and about 60 per cent will actually be sick. Others may complain of . stomach ache. Only 20â€‰â€‰per cent have auras. But as children often . complain of the occasional headache and can be prone to tummy aches, the . symptoms can be mistaken for something else, such as an allergy or . sinus problems. A consultant has helped her and she takes magnesium pills to ease symptoms . Migraine charities say they often hear of children . who have suffered for months or even years before getting a correct . diagnosis. The vomiting associated with migraines is even mistaken . for appendicitis, says  Dr Andy Dowson, director of headache services at . King's College Hospital, London. 'The symptoms may also be mistaken . for attempts to avoid school. In children the attacks are often about . four hours long, so by the time they are picked up from school by their . parents they may be better, and accused of malingering.' Children's attacks tend to be shorter - hours compared with up to three days for an adult. What . causes migraines is not clear. One theory is that low levels of the . brain chemical serotonin cause blood vessels in the brain to contract . suddenly and then expand. Sickness is caused by chemical changes during . an attack stimulating the area of the brain that controls vomiting.The condition also runs in families, so it may be genetic. Attacks . can be brought on by all sorts of triggers - some people are sensitive . to caffeine, others to too much or too little sleep. Stress can also . make migraine worse, for example, during exam time.Childhood . migraine expert Dr Ishaq Abu-Arafeh says his patients at the Royal . Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow can miss up to 80 days of school a . year. 'In every class at least two or three children will suffer . with migraine,' he says. 'Some may only have it two or three times a . year, but others will have it more frequently and it causes a lot of . problems with their education and social activities. 'Most children with migraine are between the ages of five and 15. The impact on them and their families can be huge.' Yet there are fewer preventative treatments for children than for adults, as many drugs have not been approved for under-18s. Two . drugs tend to be used: pizotifen, to prevent swelling in blood vessels . in the brain; and propranolol, which acts in a similar way. Paracetamol . and ibuprofen can help when an attack has started. Dr Abu-Arafeh . advises reducing children's intake of caffeine from drinks such as cola . and not skipping meals, as low blood sugar can cause attacks. He also . recommends time outside for an hour a day, away from screens. Bright . light is a common trigger, especially the blue light from iPads, . computer screens, mobile phones and TVs. 'Once someone has migraine they . always have it, but as they get older the migraine goes into good and . bad phases, and the good phases without headaches can last for years,' says Dr Abu-Arafeh. 'Often a person's threshold for what triggers a migraine increases, so what caused one when they were younger no longer does.' Josi's migraines are now better controlled. She . was referred to a paediatric neurologist in June 2012 and tried several . medications including pizotifen, a nasal spray called Imigran, and . paracetamol. But none had much effect. Pictured wither mother Alma Walker, Josi would be very tired and irritable when getting a migraine . 'When a migraine was coming . on, Josi would be very tired and irritable and we often had to cancel . plans,' says Alma, who lives with her partner Christopher McLarty, 47, a . school caretaker, and their other daughters Morgan, 16, and Erin, 14, . in Killin, Perthshire.'She'd often come home from school early with a migraine.' However, . her migraine has improved thanks to a less orthodox approach - . magnesium pills. Migraine sufferers are thought to have lower levels of . magnesium in the brain during an attack. One study of 81 adults found . that taking 600mg of magnesium daily for 12 weeks reduced the number of . migraine attacks by 42 per cent. Dr Abu-Arafeh says it helps some . children with migraine and he often recommends it when other treatments . have proved ineffective. 'It can be bought over the counter and is safe in the recommended doses,' he says. Josi has not had a full-blown migraine since November, a month after she started on magnesium. 'The . pain felt like tiny men trying to thump out of my head,' she says. 'I . felt very tired and had to miss things my friends and sisters were . doing. Now I just have a bit of a sore head, which I can cope with.'","Josi McLarty, 10, from Killin, is one of 10% of children who suffer migraines .

"By . Emma Innes . A devastated mother and father have both been diagnosed with terminal cancer within weeks of each other. Ian Lovewell, 53, and his wife Jayne, 50, both have incurable lung cancer. Since the diagnoses they have vowed to live the rest of their lives to the full with their three children - Hanna, 28, Ross, 25, and Mitchell, 12. Ian and Jayne Lovewell have both been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer within weeks of each other. They are pictured with their children, Hanna, 28, Ross, 25, and Mitchell, 12 . Their daughter, Hanna Lovewell, said: ‘This terrible news has knocked our family for six but we’re all fully behind mum and dad.’ She said that her father, of Thorpe St Andrew, near Norwich, developed a cough in January and was initially treated for pneumonia. However, after a string of tests and consultations he was finally told he actually had lung cancer which had also spread to his brain and liver. Then last month, his wife began to feel unwell. Mrs Lovewell initially put the symptoms down to the stress of her husband’s illness. But, she was then diagnosed with lung and pancreatic cancer after making several trips to see doctors at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital. Mr and Mrs Lovewell's family are now raising money for a ward at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital where they are being treated . Ms Lovewell says that neither of her parents smoke or drink and that both lead very healthy lives. Mr Lovewell works for Britvic soft drinks in Norwich while his wife is functions manager at a local pub. ‘It’s been very tough,’ said Miss Lovewell. ‘It’s not very often you will hear someone say that both their parents are suffering from this at the same time. ‘We’re just waiting now to see what mum’s treatment will be.’ Source: NHS Choices . Miss Lovewell said her father had been given a year to live but they were hoping and praying he’d be with them all longer. Cancer charity Macmillan is actively supporting the family and a relative is staying with them to help look after their youngest son. ‘Their attitude is that they will battle it and we all will,’ said Miss Lovewell. ‘We’re all trying to stay positive as we have to and stay strong to make the most of the time we have got together.’ She added: ‘We will do everything we can to enjoy everything. ‘It just gives you a totally different outlook on everything.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . It has only just been announced that scientists are working on printing a heart using a patient’s own cells and now a 3D model of a cancerous tumour has been created using a 3D printer. The model, which consists of a scaffold of fibrous proteins coated in cervical cancer cells, provides a realistic 3D representation of a tumour’s environment. It is hoped that it could help in the discovery of new drugs and cast new light on how tumours develop, grow and spread throughout the body. Realistic: A 3D model of a cancerous tumour has been created using a 3D printer. The model, which consists of a scaffold of fibrous proteins coated in cervical cancer cells, has provided a realistic 3D representation of a tumour's environment. 3D printed HeLa cells in tumour-like configurations are pictured . 3D printing is already being used in medicine. Researchers have used the technology to make splints, valves and even a human ear. So far, the University of Louisville in Kentucky has printed human heart valves and small veins with cells. The team has also successfully tested the tiny blood vessels in mice and other small animals. Professor Williams, of the Cardiovascular Innovation Institute, believes scientists will be able to print parts and assemble an entire heart in three to five years. The 3D printer uses a mixture of a gel and living cells to gradually build the shape of a blood vessel – and one day a heart. The idea is that eventually, the cells would grow together to form the tissue. In the future it could take just three hours to print the whole structure of the heart. A group of researchers in China and the U.S. created a model of a grid structure that measures 1cm squared and is made from gelatine, alginate and fibrin to recreate the fibrous proteins that make up the extracellular matrix of a tumour. The grid structure is coated in Hela cells - a unique, ‘immortal’ cell line that was originally derived from a cervical cancer patient in 1951. Due to the cells’ ability to divide indefinitely in laboratory conditions, the cell line has been used in some of the most significant scientific breakthrough studies of the past 50 years. Although the most effective way of studying tumours is to do so in a clinical trial, ethical and safety limitations make it difficult for these types of studies to be carried out on a wide scale. To overcome this, 2D models, consisting of a single layer of cells are created to mimic the physiological environment of tumours so that different types of drugs can be tested in a realistic way. Grid with great potential: A group of researchers created a model of a grid structure that measures 1cm squared and is made from gelatin, alginate and fibrin (pictured) to recreate the fibrous proteins that make up the extracellular matrix of a tumour. The grid structure is coated in Hela cells - a unique, 'immortal' cell line . But now scientists can make a more realistic representation of the environment surrounding a tumour using 3D printing. In the study, the researchers proved that the cells were alive after printing and examined how they proliferated as well as looking at their resistance to anti-cancer drugs. The proteins studied were part of the MMP protein family, which are used by cancer cells to break through their surrounding matrix and help tumours to spread. Resistance to anti-cancer drugs, which was also studied, is a good indicator of tumour malignancy. The results, which were published in the IOP’s journal Biofabrication, revealed that 90 per cent of the cancer cells remained viable after the printing process. Learning by heart: Earlier this week scientists announced they hope to create a new heart for a patient using a 3D printer and their own cells. The organ could be created in just three to five years time and be transplanted in a human within the next decade.  The printing of 'ventricle cylinders' is pictured . The results also showed that the 3D model had more similar characteristics to a tumour compared to 2D models and in the 3D model the cancer cells showed a higher proliferation rate (the time between cell divisions) and higher resistance to anti-cancer drugs. The lead author of the research, Professor Wei Sun, from Tsinghua University, China and Drexel University in Philadelphia, U.S. said: ‘We have provided a scalable and versatile 3D cancer model that shows a greater resemblance to natural cancer than 2D cultured cancer cells. ‘With further understanding of these 3D models, we can use them to study the development, invasion, metastasis and treatment of cancer using specific cancer cells from patients. ‘We can also use these models to test the efficacy and safety of new cancer treatment therapies and new cancer drugs.’","Researchers from Tsinghua University, China, and Drexel University, U.S. created a scaffold of proteins coated in cervical cancer cells .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A father-of-two who lost his entire memory after a breakdown has spoken of his struggle - and re-proposed to his loyal wife live on TV. Two years ago, Damian Hammond left for work as usual but never made it - instead ending up in A&E after completely losing his . memory due to a combination of stress and trauma. When his wife Cathy eventually located him in a local hospital, she was told he had total memory loss. Scroll down for video . Devoted: Damian Hill lost his entire memory two years ago. He didn't even know his own name, recognise himself or wife Cathy after the incident . New memories: Today Damian re-proposed to his wife live on national TV as a thank you for her love and support . When she later walked into the hospital room, he had no idea who she was - instead thinking she was a doctor. Over the past two years, she has remained by his side, trying to teach him not only about his past, but also how to perform basic activities such as brushing his teeth and getting dressed. Mr Hammond, 35, told ITV's This Morning: 'I was driving to work one night in May 2012 when I was struck with a severe bout of stress. 'Hours later, I woke up in hospital. Then a woman walked into the hospital bay and said ""Damian"". 'I thought she was a doctor and looked at her blankly. He told presenters Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes: 'I love her with all my heart', and then turned to Cathy and said: 'Will you re-marry me?, to which she replied 'yes, I will.' True love: Damian said even when he didn't recognise Cathy, he thought she looked nice . 'She said ""Damian - that is your name. I'm Cathy and I'm your wife"". 'I didn't know what a wife was. 'She lifted up her wedding ring finger and clicked her ring into mine. We have jigsaw wedding rings and that made me realise we must be linked in some way.' 'I saw her and thought ""she looks nice and friendly"". I was quite excited, but confused. Cathy then explained the couple have two children - and fortunately, Damian had their names tattooed on his arm. Recalling the fateful night, Cathy told presenters Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes: 'His work called to say he hadn't turned up and so I called the Police. 'I saw her and thought ""she looks nice and friendly"". I was quite excited, but confused.,' he recalled . 'Later that evening I got a call from the local hospital saying there was a chap there called Damain Hammond. 'My first question was ""is he alive or dead""? 'They said he was fit and well, but couldn't remember anything.' She admitted that she had no idea how extreme his memory loss would be. 'I had to fib to the children a bit, as you do. I told them that Daddy had slipped on mud, hit his head and had lost a bit of memory.' Damian's memory loss was so bad that he didn't even recognise himself in the mirror. 'I was scared, as I am a big chap,' he said . She then began the painstaking - and often heartbreaking - process of teaching her husband who he was, his past, and how to live. Damian's memory loss was so bad that he didn't even recognise himself in the mirror. 'I was scared, as I am a big chap [and wondered who it was],' he explained to Ruth and Eamonn. Cathy said his personalty was also much more formal. 'He was very innocent and wide-eyed and would call me Catherine, rather than a nickname,' she recalls. Two years on, he is still unable to remember huge swathes of his past. Damian says there have been flickers of his childhood that have returned - and he has had dozens of old friends contact him on social media to help try and plug the gap. But there have been other times when his memory loss has devastated him. He told the programme: 'There were some pictures of me holding the children after they were born and I couldn't remember any of it. I just sat there and burst out crying.' But Cathy says she now focuses on creating new memories, rather than trying to re-invoke old ones with bags of old photos. And this morning, he paved the way to making more new memories by asking his wife to 're-marry' him. He told Ruth and Eamonn: 'I love her with all my heart', and then turned to Cathy and said: 'Will you re-marry me?, to which she replied 'yes, I will.'","Two years ago, Damian Hammond, 35, lost all his memory due to stress .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Soil has been frozen to the bottom of the Greenland Ice Sheet for 2.7 million years, a study reveals. A piece of the GISP ice core is pictured . Scientists have discovered an ancient 'green' tundra landscape preserved below approximately two miles (3.2km) of ice. The evidence suggests that the Greenland Ice Sheet has existed much longer than previously thought and has survived a number of periods of global warming. ‘We found organic soil that has been frozen to the bottom of the ice sheet for 2.7 million years,’ said University of Vermont geologist Paul Bierman. Scientists are particularly interested in Greenland’s ice sheet as it is the second largest in the world. Its future stability could have an enormous impact on how fast and high global sea levels rise from climate change. The sheet's 656,000 square miles (1,055,000km) of ice could raise the global sea levels 23ft (7 metres) if they were to melt. Dylan Rood a co-author on the study from the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre and the University of California, Santa Barbara, said: ‘The ancient soil under the Greenland ice sheet helps to unravel an important mystery surrounding climate change.' The discovery suggests that even during the warmest periods since the vast ice sheet formed, the centre of Greenland remained stable. Dr Bierman said: ‘It’s likely that it did not fully melt at any time, which allowed the tundra landscape to be locked away under the ice for millions of years. Surprise! Scientists were stunned to discover an ancient tundra landscape frozen under two miles of ice in Greenland (pictured). It has been there for three million years and could lead scientists to reconsider how stable Greenland's ice is . The Greenland Ice Sheet is a vast body of ice covering 656,000 square miles (1,055,000km) of Greenland - approximately 80 per cent of the country's surface. It is the second largest ice body in the world after the Antarctic Ice Sheet and is around the same size as Alaska. The thickness of the ice is usually more than one mile (2km). Some climate scientists argue that the ice is nearing a 'tipping point' where it could all melt in the next 2,000 years. If the entire 684,000 cubic miles (2,850,000 cubic km) of ice did melt, it would lead to a rise in global sea levels of 23ft (7metres). The new study suggests that the Greenland Ice Sheet has been around much longer than previously thought and that it was covered in green tundra around three millions years ago. It is based on the examination of an ice core called GISP 2, which was taken in 1993. University of Vermont graduate student Lee Corbett, explained: ‘The traditional knowledge about glaciers is that they are very powerful agents of erosion and can effectively strip a landscape clean. '[Instead] we demonstrate that the Greenland Ice Sheet is not acting as an agent of erosion; in fact, at its centre, it has performed incredibly little erosion since its inception almost three million years ago.’ Dr Bierman described the ice sheet as a refrigerator that has preserved the landscape. The scientists found the tundra by taking a fresh look at 17 ‘dirty ice’ samples from the deepest 40ft of the 10,019ft GISP2 ice core extracted in 1993. They extracted a rare form of the element beryllium - an isotope called beryllium-10 – which was formed by cosmic rays and trapped in the soil and rock. The longer soil is exposed at Earth’s surface, the more beryllium-10 it accumulates and measuring how much is soil or rock allows geologists to date the material. Scientists are concerned about ice from the Greenland Ice Sheet melting because it could raise global sea levels significantly. These images show the extent of surface melt in July 2012 (from left to right) The researchers expected to only find soil from eroded rocks, but instead discovered the silt had very high concentrations of the isotope, which they measured on a particle accelerator at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Joseph Graly who analysed the beryllium data, said: ‘On a global basis, we only find these sorts of beryllium concentrations in soils that have developed over hundreds of thousands to millions of years.’ The research shows that the soil has been stable and exposed at the surface for somewhere between 200,000 and one million years before it was covered with ice. The team also measured nitrogen and carbon that could have been left by plant material in the core sample. The fact that measurable amounts of organic material were found in the silty ice suggests that the pre-glacial landscape may have been partially forested tundra. Dr Rood said: ‘Greenland really was green! However, it was millions of years ago. ‘Greenland looked like the green Alaskan tundra, before it was covered by the second largest body of ice on Earth.’","University of Vermont researchers analysed soil to prove the presence of an ancient tundra two miles (3.2km) below the Greenland Ice Sheet .

"By . Ben Spencer . Sucking carbon dioxide out of the air might be used as a last-ditch attempt to stop global warming, UN scientists say. The technology is proposed as a ‘Plan B’ if Governments fail to cut carbon dioxide emissions by up to 70 per cent before 2050. Reducing greenhouse gases to manageable levels will cost up to four per cent of global GDP by 2030, according to a draft version of a report to be published in Berlin on Sunday by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The 'sucking CO2' technology would involve growing crops that absorb CO2 from the atmosphere then burning them in a power station to generate energy. A biomass plant is pictured. The resulting emissions would then be captured at the plant and then stored underground, resulting in CO2being removed from the air . Experts could be able to 'suck' carbon dioxide out of the air by using an experimental system called BECCS –Bio-energy with Carbon Capture and Storage. It would involve growing crops that absorb CO2 from the atmosphere then burn them in a power station to generate energy. The resulting emissions would then be captured at the plant and then stored underground. The net effect of that process would result in CO2 being removed from the air. Britain . would be an ideal place to try the technology, because there are . thousands of old coal mines and gas wells which could be used as storage . facilities for carbon dioxide. That would involve Britain and other nations increasing spending ten-fold on wind farms and other green projects over the next 15 years. But if carbon emissions ‘overshoot’ the targets, more extreme solutions are needed which will send the costs spiralling even higher, the IPCC says. A leaked copy of the report, seen by the Daily Mail, suggests Governments might have to start looking at ‘negative emissions’ technology which effectively suck CO2 out of the air and store it underground. The leaked draft concludes that ‘essentially any’ emissions target can be achieved ‘regardless of the near‐term path’ of overshoot ‘by shifting emissions reductions to the future’. But it says doing so ‘involves more rapid and deeper emissions reductions in the long run’. Counting the cost: Cutting greenhouse gases to manageable levels will cost up to four per cent of global GDP by 2030, according to a draft version of a forthcoming IPCC report. That would involve Britain and other nations increasing spending ten-fold on wind farms (pictured) and other green projects over the next 15 years .

Britain would be an ideal place to try the technology, because there are thousands of old coal mines and gas wells which could be used as storage facilities for carbon dioxide. The system has been tested at small scale in the USA and Canada – but the IPCC admits it would have to happen on a huge scale to be effective. Britain would be an ideal place to try the technology, because there are thousands of old coal mines (pictured) and gas wells which could be used as storage facilities for carbon dioxide . Joris Koornneef, an expert at sustainable energy consultancy Ecofys, estimates an area the size of India would be needed to produce enough biomass crops for BECCS to suck 10 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide from the air – a third of the emissions reduction needed by 2050. There are also concerns about how safe the technology is and whether it is even possible to store carbon dioxide underground long-term without it leaking. The draft IPCC chapter on energy systems says: ‘A combination of bio-energy and carbon capture and storage (BECCS) generally will result in net negative emissions.  BECCS is one of the few technologies that are capable to remove past CO2 emissions remaining the atmosphere.’ But it adds: ‘The risks associated with a large-scale deployment of carbon capture and storage include concerns about the life-cycle toxicity of some capture solvents, the operational safety and long-term integrity of CO2 storage sites, as well as risks associated with CO2 transport via dedicated pipelines.’ The British Government is already exploring options for capturing carbon from coal and gas-fired plants and hopes to get 13 gigawatts of fossil fuel power with carbon capture systems online by 2030. But it is sceptical about the potential of the ‘carbon negative’ technology involved with the BECCS system. British officials have already asked the IPCC to alter the section on BECCS. In a document obtained by the Daily Mail, which criticises the wording of the draft, British representatives said: ‘It is essential that the limitations of this technology, and the uncertainty and scale, are clearly set out.’ Other nations, including China, Japan and Russia, also said the prospects for a ‘negative emissions’ technology should be toned down. Sven Teske of Greenpeace said there are many uncertainties associated with storing carbon dioxide. He said: ‘It might work in countries like the UK and Norway where there are lots of empty oil wells and gas wells. ‘But compared to the problem it can only play a minor role. And we don’t actually know if the CO2 will even remain in the ground. ‘Overall it would be much cheaper to just go to straight to a carbon neutral renewable technology.’ Conclusive? Last September the first part of the IPCC's report summarised the physical science of climate change, concluding that scientists are 95 per cent certain that humans are the 'dominant cause' of global warming . The IPCC report is the first major assessment in seven years of the technological options and economic costs of dealing with climate change. The document is the final part in a trilogy of reports published by the IPCC on the causes, impacts and solutions to climate change. Last September the first part of the report summarised the physical science of climate change, concluding that scientists are 95 per cent certain that humans are the ‘dominant cause’ of global warming. The second part, published a fortnight ago, warned that the drastic impacts of climate change are ‘already occurring on all continents and across the oceans’. The draft of the third report says that reducing global warming to 2C, beyond which the impacts would start to become irreversible, ‘will require large-scale changes of the global energy system as well as cuts in greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades’. It adds: ‘Delaying mitigation [to] 2030 will increase the challenges of, and reduce the options for, bringing atmospheric concentration levels [to safe levels] by the end of the century.’","'Negative emissions' technology is proposed as a ‘Plan B’ if Governments fail to cut carbon dioxide emissions by up to 70 per cent before 2050 .

"By . Daniel Martin . David Cameron has announced the shake up to GP opening hours . Doctors need more money if David Cameron’s plans to end GPs’ nine-to-five culture is to succeed, their union claimed last night. The Prime Minister announced that millions of patients will be able to see their GP at evenings and weekends for the first time thanks to an injection of extra cash. He said more than 7.5million people will benefit from the extended access – and from new consultation methods such as being able to phone or email a GP. There will also be more tailored care for the over-75s, and a pledge that an extra 5,000 GPs will be employed by 2020. But the British Medical Association, which represents doctors, said that the £50million announced by the Government to pay for the scheme was simply not enough to ensure the promised extended hours would be affordable in the long-term. They called for even more money to be given to practices to ensure the extra opening can be continued beyond the year the grant will pay for. And they said all doctors’ surgeries should benefit from the extra cash – not just those in the pilot areas. Family doctors benefited from a huge pay rise as a result of Labour’s botched 2004 contract, giving them an average salary of £105,000. But the vast majority opted out of responsibility for patients at evenings and weekends. The average GP now works fewer hours than before the contract while patients increasingly find it hard to see their GP without taking time off work. This has been blamed, in part, for the surge in attendances at hard-pressed A&E departments. Scroll down for video . Many GPs opted out of evening and weekend care when their new contract system was introduced . The difficultly people have in getting an appointment with their GP is cited as a reason for the increasing pressures on A&E departments . The £50million GP Access Fund, announced by Mr Cameron today, will mean that patients at 1,147 GP practices across England will be able to see their family doctor outside of working hours, including seven-day opening and appointments from 8am to 8pm. The Prime Minister also announced that about 800,000 people over 75 and those with more serious health complaints will get tailored care, co-ordinated by a single GP. These patients will also be offered same-day access to a GP when they need it. Mr Cameron said: ‘This is an important step and good news for patients.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the elderly will benefit most from reforms . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the reforms would mostly benefit the elderly. ‘People want to know that their parents and relatives will get constant care if they have a long-term condition. Many doctors already give great care but I want to make sure this is completely co-ordinated to head off problems and keep people from going to hospital unnecessarily.’ But Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association’s general practice committee, warned that the £50million funding only covered a minority  of practices, and was only  for one year – meaning there was no ‘assurance of these changes being affordable in future years’. ‘General practice is currently under intense pressure from escalating patient demand and falling resources,’ he said. ‘These changes will need  to be properly supported.  Ministers must also deliver  on their commitment to increase resources in the  community so that there are more GPs, nurses and other health and social care services to provide co-ordinated care to the escalating number of patients who need care closer to home.’ The British Medical Association is arguing surgeries need more money for the shift to be feasible . Lessons must be learned from Mid Staffs scandal, MPs warned . Commons committee claims there is a culture of denial in NHS . Warning comes on the back of report revealing thousands of elderly are 'suffering in silence' on hospital wards . Tragedies like the Mid Staffs scandal could be repeated unless there is a revolution in the way the public sector deals with complaints, MPs warned last night. A Commons committee found there was a culture of denial among managers in councils, schools and the health service – meaning they take little notice of criticism. Their failure to listen is so bad that aggrieved members of the public simply believe there is no point in making complaints, MPs found. Tragedies like the Mid Staffs scandal could be repeated unless lessons are learned by the public sector . The report from the Commons public administration select committee comes a week after England’s top health watchdog warned that tens of thousands of elderly people were ‘suffering in silence’ on NHS wards because they were too polite to ‘make a fuss’. In an article for the Daily Mail, Dame Julie Mellor, the health service ombudsman, called for a ‘significant cultural shift’ in the way complaints are handled. The MPs’ report also highlighted the failures that were exposed in the damning review by Robert Francis QC on Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, where up to 1,200 died amid appalling neglect. Tens of thousands of elderly people are 'suffering in silence' on wards, according to a report. Stock image . It called on ministers to force a culture change across the public sector to prevent future tragedies.Committee chairman Bernard Jenkin said: ‘There needs to be a revolution in the way public services are run, and how the public perceives government. Bernard Jenkin: 'There needs to be a revolution in the way public services are run' ‘As things are, most people believe  there is no point in complaining. Unless and until we have a culture of leadership in public services that listens to, values and responds to complaints  from service users and staff, there will always be the potential for tragedies like Mid Staffs.’ The committee recommended a minister for complaints should be introduced, along with a dedicated unit to deal with grievances about government agencies. Its report, More Complaints Please, found public sector managers viewed complaints as ‘hostile criticism’ rather than a chance to tackle problems. MPs called for a culture where complaints are valued and suggested the Cabinet Office work with high performing private sector companies to find the best ways of dealing with the issue. The committee also attacked the public sector for using euphemistic words such as ‘feedback’ instead of ‘complaint’, saying they give the impression that concerns are not being taken on board. Last night Dame Julie said: ‘The findings present an opportunity for organisations to deal more effectively with complaints and develop ways to learn from those mistakes. ‘Good complaint handling has to start from the top, and strong leaders will recognise the valuable opportunities complaints provide to really improve.’ Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘It’s essential for better public services that the Government makes it easier and more effective for people  to complain. ‘Giving people a single point of contact and having a minister who is responsible should give people more confidence that complaints do count.’ The report by Dame Julie Mellor, left, echoed some of the concerns of Robert Francis's earlier review, right .","David Cameron has announced GP surgeries will be open for longer .

"By . Mark Prigg . Google has put its controversial eyewear on sale to the public for the first time today. The firm is offering the 'explorer edition', the $1500 test version of the eyewear, for general sale for the first time. It is believed the firm wants to increase the number of people people using the hardware - and potentially clear its inventory for the 'real' consumer version. Scroll down for video . Next generation: Google Glass has revealed the new look of its high-tech device . Buyers can visit http://google.com/glass/start/how-to-get-one to buy Glass. 'Any adult in the US can become an Explorer by visiting our site and purchasing Glass for $1500 + tax – and it now comes with your favorite shade or frame, thanks to feedback from our current Explorers. 'The number of spots available is limited, so mark your calendar if you want to get in.' Source: Google . The firm announced the move last week. 'Whoops. So... we’d planned to post this next week, but it looks like the cat's out of the bag now,' Google said. 'Over the past several months, we’ve been trying out different ways to expand the Explorer program. 'Our Explorers are moms, bakers, surgeons, rockers, and each new Explorer has brought a new perspective that is making Glass better. 'But every day we get requests from those of you who haven’t found a way into the program yet, and we want your feedback too. 'So in typical Explorer Program fashion, we’re trying something new. ' Next Tuesday, April 15th at 6am PDT, the firm will allow anyone in the US to buy them. 'The number of spots available is limited, so mark your calendar if you want to get in,' the firm said. Google will also include a free sunglass shade or one of its newly-introduced prescription glasses frames along with any purchase. Those who currently own the device paid $1,500 to be part of the development process, exchanging ideas on improvements to the design and function in return for the coveted device. With the release of the second-generation, those already enrolled in the Google Explorer program  were able to 'invite' three of their friends to the scheme. Reaction to the new design was mixed, with some critics saying changes to the device looked bulky. Google has come under fire for the unfashionable look of Glass, although has developed its own frames for the system which allow prescription lenses, and partnered with Ray-Ban to develop fashionable frames. The secret document obtained by The Verge that reveals the plan . Stylish: The frames will be available in a range of colors and will work with prescription glasses . However, the updates were welcomed by those who have a first-generation device, with comments on its Google + page commenting that the changes would improve user experience. One owner, Dawn Martin, commented: 'My glass has been useless for phone calls and nav because I can't hear it well enough ... yay for updates/upgrades!' Improved: The slightly bulkier design comes with a detachable ear piece to improve commands . Upgrade: Big Bang Theory's Kunal Nayyar wearing the Google Glass at the Emmys in September. Those with the earlier design will be able to swap their old device for the new one . Another fan of the device, Jeremiah Townsend, commented: 'Can't wait ... now that we'll be able to use them with prescription glasses, they'll be glued to my face.'﻿ . Others however complained that the device was still not widely available. Google recently revealed the first official etiquette guide for its Glass wearable computer - and admits users have been seen as 'creepy and rude' for wearing the device. The firm warns users to ask people's permission before recording them, and warns against 'glassing out' where they focus on the screen too much. The guide comes as Google is expanding the number of people who have the $1500 prototypes, ahead of an expected release later this year. 'With new technology comes new questions, and our Explorers help to answer those questions,' Google said. 'Since the program started, our Explorers have gotten a lot of attention when they wear Glass out and about. 'Reactions range from the curious – 'Wow! Are those the ‘Google glasses’? How do they work?” – to the suspect – 'Goodness gracious do those things see into my soul?!'

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . The Hubble telescope might be almost 24 years old, but astronomers are still finding ways to improve its capabilities. Their latest innovation has seen them find a way to measure the distances to stars up to 10,000 light-years away. That’s ten times farther than was previously possible with the telescope. Astronomers applied a technique known as spatial scanning to increase Hubble's ability to gauge distances ten-fold. The method uses something known as parallax, a form of trigonometry, to measure distances . ‘This new capability is expected to yield new insight into the nature of dark energy, a mysterious component of space that is pushing the universe apart at an ever-faster rate,' said Noble laureate Adam Riess of the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, US. Riess and the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, in collaboration with Stefano Casertano of STScI, developed the technique to extend Hubble’s sight. This upgraded capability is made possible using something known as parallax. This is a trigonometric technique that can be used to make reliable measures of astronomical distances. To understand how it works, imagine Earth’s orbit and a distant star form a triangle. Earth’s orbit forms the base of the triangle, with two imaginary lines running to the star and making the ‘point’ of the triangle. The length of these lines, and thus the distance to the star, can be calculated by measuring the three ‘angles’ of the imaginary triangle. This method works well for stars that are relatively close to us, those a few hundred light-years away, but for stars further away it is harder as the angles become smaller and more difficult to measure. The Hubble Space Telescope was launched on 24 April 1990, but a Space Shuttle repair mission was required soon after launch to get it fully functional after a fault in one of the mirrors was discovered . To extend the yardstick, astronomers have found a way to measure smaller angles more accurately using Hubble, down to five-billionths of a degree. They tested this by getting Hubble to measure the distance to a Cepheid variable, which is a class of bright star often referred to as a ‘standard candle’ of the universe for distance measurements. Cepheid variables are stars that vary between large, bright states and small, dense ones. Their importance was recognised by female astronomer Henrietta Swan Leavitt in 1908, who realised that the relationship of a Cepheid variable’s changing state and its luminosity could be used to place ‘distance markers’ across the universe. Using this principle, Hubble correctly confirmed the star in question in the constellation Auriga was 7,500 light-years away. It did this by taking two exposures of the target star six months apart, when our planet was on opposite sides of the sun. A very small shift in the star’s position was then measured to an accuracy of 1/1,000th of a single image pixel in Hubble’s Wide Field Camera 3, which has 16.8 megapixels (16.8 million pixels) in total. A third exposure was then taken six months later to remove errors. This then gave the correct distant measurement, which the astronomers knew previously. The telescope was so accurate, in fact, that the astronomers are now planning to use Hubble to refine the ‘cosmic distance ladder,' a ‘rung’ of measurements for the universe that uses various Cepheid variables as distance markers. Although Hubble might be pushing a quarter of a century in age, this latest innovation proves just how useful the telescope is in our continuing studies of the cosmos. The Hubble Space Telescope was carried into orbit by a Space Shuttle in 1990 . Hubble's four main instruments observe in the near ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared . Its . orbit outside the distortion of Earth's atmosphere allows it to take . extremely high-resolution images with almost no background light .

Hubble is the only telescope designed to be serviced in space by astronauts . Its scientific successor, the James Webb Space Telescope is currently scheduled to be launched by Nasa in 2018 .","Astronomers have used trigonometry to increase the range of Hubble .

"By . Amie Keeley . and Wills Robinson . A family faced an appalling dilemma when their car burst into flames in the middle of Longleat safari park’s lion enclosure. Helen Clements and her daughter, Charlie, 12, and son George, nine, were enjoying an Easter trip to the Wiltshire attraction. Their car then set on fire and faced a life-or-death decision of whether to stay in their vehicle and risk being engulfed by the flames, or leave and face the lions who were just 100 yards away. Mrs Clements, 43, described how her family tried to get out of the car, but rangers at the park told them to stay put for 'safety reasons'. She said: ‘Being Good Friday it was busy and we had to keep stopping and starting the car. Everything was fine until we got into the lion enclosure. Scroll down for videos . A family were forced to flee their 4x4 after it overheated at Longleat Safari Park, Wiltshire - but they had no option but to escape into the lion enclosure. Seconds after they abandoned the vehicle it burst into flames . The mother and her two children were on a tour of the park when the 4x4 overheated and smoke started pouring from the engine.  It burst into flames in the middle of the lion enclosure – which is home to 12 lions . Horrified family: (from left to right) George Clements, nine, Helen Clements, 43, and Charlie Clements, 12, who were faced with a life-or-death decision in the lion enclosure . ‘The car just stopped and started to overheat. What I thought was steam started coming from the  bonnet then it got darker and turned into smoke through the vent and towards us. ‘I knew the lions were only 100 yards away and I just didn’t know what to do – should we get out of the car or should we stay? I sounded the horn and could see some park rangers but I kept an eye on the bonnet and then I saw the flames.’ Mrs Clements, who is an assistant in her village shop in Kingswood,  Gloucestershire, continued: ‘The kids were panicking and there were a lot of tears. ‘George was in the back and opened the door and got out of  the car but a ranger shouted, “Get back in.” Siblings: Charlie Clements, 12, and younger brother George, 9, were in the car when it set on fire . Terrifying: Helen Clements, 43, spoke say park rangers initially told her family to stay in the vehicle for 'safety reasons' ‘I shouted back that we can’t – it’s on fire – and opened the driver’s door and started to get out and at that moment the rangers pulled up and we all jumped in with them. ‘The rangers had to keep the lions out of . the way. 'People who saw it happening said the lions knew something was . happening and were intrigued but fortunately didn’t come too close. 'It . all happened so quickly it’s difficult to recall exactly what happened, . but the children soon calmed down and they’ve now got a wonderful story . to tell all their school chums. A spokesman for Longleat said the trio were transferred to a ranger's vehicle and the park was temporarily closed while firefighters extinguished the blaze . The lions were cleared from the enclosure and the safari park was closed while firefighters tackled the blazing vehicle . They were forced to abandon the smoking vehicle and had no option but to flee to the lion enclosure, which is home to 12 adult lions . ‘It could have been a lot worse. My daughter was mainly upset that she’d left her phone in the car.’ Fire crews from Warminster put out the flames within 15 minutes. Watch manager Chris Trimby said: ‘When we arrived the car was well alight. ‘Our main concern was being able to get to the car safely while inside a lion enclosure.’ A spokesman for Longleat said: ‘On Friday  at around 1pm a car overheated in the first lion enclosure at Longleat Safari & Adventure Park. ‘The lions were cleared from the enclosure and the safari park was closed. No one was injured in any way and no lions were hurt. ‘The vehicle has been safely removed and the safari park has fully re-opened to visitors.’ The family were forced to escape into the lion enclosure after their 4x4 burst into flames while they were on a tour of the park in Wiltshire on Friday . Wayne Skinner, who was in the queue with his family waiting to get into the enclosure told Mail Online: . 'We wondered what was going on, looked across and saw at first what . looked like steam, so we assumed that the car had just overheated. 'Then we saw the steam getting thicker and turning to smoke. That's when we realised something was wrong. 'We couldn't really tell from the distance we were, but the mother and two children looked distraught. 'The passenger door opened twice as the rangers turned up, but they told them to close the door. 'However a ranger vehicle pulled up close by very quickly and took everybody to safety. 'None . of the surrounding cars tried to help, I suppose they were worried . about the lions. If we had been closer, we would have tried to get them . all into our car. 'I know it would've been breaking every rule and sign, but it's better to get people to safety first.

'It was scary. Our children were panicking, and we didn't know if the car was going to explode and hurt people nearby.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A former Army Ranger has spoken for the first time about his fear that he fired the fatal round that killed NFL star Pat Tillman. Tillman, who gave up a $3.6 million football contract to serve his country in the aftermath of 9/11, was killed by friendly fire in Afghanistan when his regiment was ambushed in Afghanistan. The footballer died after a second group of rangers, including Steven Elliott, fired towards him, believing that Tillman was a Taliban insurgent. Scroll down for video . American hero: Pat Tillman gave up a multi-million dollar contract with the Cardinals to be an Army Ranger . Haunted: Ten years after Tillman was killed by friendly fire, Steven Elliott has revealed his fears that he was responsible for the deadly shots . That fateful day, of April 22, 2004, has haunted Elliott ever since as he wondered if his bullets had been the ones to kill the 27-year-old, he told ESPN. He was one of three Rangers who opened fire towards the ridge where Tillman was standing, in the mistaken belief that he was part of the enemy. Despite an Army investigation into the shooting, it was never determined who fired the deadly round. But the 33-year-old is plagued by the belief that he was responsible for the three shots that hit Tillman in the head. 'It is possible, in my mind, that I hit him,' Elliott told ESPN. He explained that at the time of the shooting, the Rangers had been traveling through a ravine when they came under fire. Tillman, Bryan O'Neal, and an Afghan soldier had crept on to a ridge to provide cover but, silhouetted against the setting sun, the rescue party were mistaken for the enemy. 'I remember seeing the rounds were impacting - 'pop, pop, pop, pop' - just walking in a line right up to where I was laying,' O'Neal, who was 19 at the time, said. Legacy: Footballer and war hero Tillman is remembered with pride by all who knew him . Legend: Tillman, right, celebrates a Cardinals win with his teammates before he joined the Army . Video Source YouTube . Elliott and another soldier had opened fire in their direction, as they mirrored the actions of their platoon leader, Sergeant Greg Baker. 'The mantra is that when all else fails . you do what your team leader does, you go where your team leader goes . and you shoot where your team leader shoots,' Elliott said. 'So effectively him [Baker] firing at that position is, is the . same as his giving an order to fire â€¦ And it breaks my heart to say . that, because I know that he regrets that - so much,' Elliott told ESPN, as his voice cracked with emotion. Tillman, who had been a star player for the Arizona Cardinals, died from three bullet wounds to the head. The position of the fatal injury has added to Elliott's fears that he had been the one to kill him. 'You are . holding your trigger for a fraction of a second, but that fraction of a . second releases three to five rounds,' he said. 'If . it looked like you had [three] rounds and very close to one another, . well, that was very consistent to how I was firing my weapon at that . point.' Horror: Bryan O'Neal was standing close to Tillman when their platoon mistakenly opened fire on them . He added: 'It would be disingenuous for me to say there is no way my . rounds didnâ€™t kill him, because my rounds very well could have.' Elliott left the army in 2007 and his marriage broke up as he struggled to come to terms with the events of that day. After being treated for post traumatic stress disorder, rediscovering his faith, and patching things up with his wife - the couple recently remarried - Elliott says he finally feels able to talk about the shooting. 'If I could change what happened, I would change it in a heartbeat,' he said. He added that he hopes by going public with his feelings of guilt, other veterans suffering from the same concerns may find stability and support. It may be ten years since Tillman's tragic death, but the soldier who was lauded for giving up a lucrative football career to serve his country, has left an amazing legacy. An 8ft statue of the athlete was put up in Arizona, and schools and football stadiums have been named in his honor. Impact: The shooting affected Elliott's life, leading him to quit the army and divorce his wife. The couple later remarried as Elliott began to cope . Perhaps the most important part of his legacy however is the 300 servicemen and woman who found their way into the forces through the Tillman Military Scholarships. 'We don't know what Pat would have done if he had lived, but I imagine he would have continued to serve for the rest of his life,' Adrian Kinsella, a Marine captain, told the Mercury News. 'That's what all of the Tillman scholars feel like we have to do. Every day I ask: ""Am I living up to Pat's ideal?"".' Another scholar, Erik Wittreich, still recalls how Tillman had shrugged off his sporting fame to become a soldier. 'I remember how everyone was whispering as he was walking down a hallway, saying, ""There he is"",'  Wittreich, who trained with Tillman and later earned one of the scholarships, said.","Arizona Cardinals player Tillman had given up $3.6 million contract to serve his country .

"By . Scarlett Russell . It’s advice no betrayed woman wants to hear. British author and relationship counsellor Andrew G Marshall says in his new book that women should apologise to their cheating husbands if they want to save their marriage. Like many of us, agony aunt Denise Robertson couldn’t disagree more - and more battled it out with him during a debate today on This Morning. Scroll down for video . Heated debate: Denise Robertson and Andrew G Marshall battled out the pros and cons of apologsing when your husband has cheated on you . Denise Robertson (left) disagrees with the opinions expressed by relationship counsellor Andrew G Marshall (right) in his book My Husband Doesn't Love Me... And He's Texting Someone Else . Denise Robertson, the morning magazine programme's long-standing agony aunt, said that while Marshall’s theory might well get a man’s attention, it would be for all the wrong reasons. ‘It might arouse their contempt or it might make them feel as though they have carte blanche to do it whenever they feel like it,’ said Robertson. ‘You should not have to say I’m sorry if you are the wronged person,’ she continued. ‘It’s not always the fault of the other partner.’ Marshall’s controversial comments come from his book My Husband Doesn't Love Me... And He's Texting Someone Else. In the book, which was adapted by Mail Online last week, Marshall says you should: 'Commit to change. 'Have you made a full apology? 'This is one that acknowledges your unhelpful behaviour (eg taking him for granted), accepts your responsibility (you've been so wrapped up in the children you've forgotten to be a wife as well as a mother), expresses sorrow and a determination to change, and is sincere.' Say you're sorry: Marshall's believes that when a man cheats, it's his partner who should apologise to him . Appearing on This Morning, he maintained that a woman is not responsible for her partner’s bad behaviour, but said: ‘If your husband is a good man who has been behaving badly and you want to save your marriage, you need to work.’ ‘You are one half of the relationship.’ Marshall argued that be criticising your partner for his affair, you’re pushing him away and giving him more reason to leave and believe he’d been right in cheating. ‘But instead, as yourself “What comes next?”’ said Marshall. ‘What would you would have done differently? By apologising you get his attention. ‘You get him to look at his half, look at what he’s done. ‘Criticising makes people angry, apologising gets people talking.’ Robertson grew increasingly frustrated with Marshall as the debate heated up. ‘You say men are pre-programmed to need sex,’ she put to Marshall. ‘Are you suggesting women aren’t? ‘There’s a grain of truth is what you’re saying but you’ve gone too far to suggest someone should apologise for the other person’s affair.’ The programme took a poll from viewers while the debate was raging. At the end, it revealed 90 per cent of the voting audience agreed with Robertson’s stance, and just 10 percent with Marshall’s.","Andrew G Marshall thinks women should apologise to cheating husbands .

We’re all really sorry to hear about your grandmother and can sympathize/empathize with your situation,"" Kevin Crawford, Oculus’s customer service lead, replied back to Priscilla the next day. 'The email has made its rounds within the Support group and it was a unanimous decision that we needed to help you out....Keeping with the spirit of these specific Rifts, it only makes sense that we loan a working developer Rift to another game dev.'

'Her favorite part was just being able to walk up and down the stairs again of the villa in the Tuscany demo,' said Priscilla. 'I guess we take a lot of things for granted.' The idea to use the virtual reality headset as therapy came after Roberta told her granddaughter about a dream she had. In it, Priscilla come back from the future with Priscilla's sister, and they would take her to the future using a time traveling chair to cure her cancer. The next day, Priscilla was at work discussing new consoles with her co-workers, including the Rift.

"By . Sophie Borland . Leading doctors have accused the Government of betraying NHS whistleblowers despite promising they will be protected. They say nothing has changed over the last year even though ministers have pledged to change the culture of the Health Service to make it easier for staff to raise concerns. Only last week it emerged that an NHS trust had spent £10million trying to silence cardiologist Dr Raj Mattu who warned of patients dying on overcrowded wards. Unfairly dismissed: Dr Raj Mattu with his wife Sangeeta . He was suspended from Coventry's Walgrave Hospital in 2000 and later sacked but last Thursday he was vindicated when a High Court judge ruled he had been unfairly dismissed. Since then, a further two cases have come to light involving senior doctors who have effectively been barred from the NHS after raising concerns. Peter O'Keefe, a surgeon at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, has been suspended on full pay since 2012 after warning a patient had become brain damaged due to poor care. And paediatric surgeon Shiban Ahmed has been suspended by Alder Hey in Liverpool since 2009 and wrongly accused of being 'suicidal' after warning that five patients had died needlessly. Dr Peter Tomlin, of the Doctors' Support Group, said: 'We have constantly been promised better protection for whistleblowers and an end to long-term suspensions. Neither has happened.' Last March, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt promised to end 'the era of gagging NHS staff'. It followed a damning inquiry into the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal, in which doctors and nurses were bullied for raising concerns. It later emerged staff were being made to sign gagging orders after being sacked, meaning they lose any pay-off if they speak about poor care. Mr Hunt set up a whistleblowing helpline for staff and promised they would be supported. But there is growing consensus that the culture remains the same. Last month Dr Kim Holt, a paediatrician who raised the alarm at the clinic which failed to spot abuse in the high-profile Baby P case, told MPs there had not been any significant change. She said: 'I don't think things have moved on in any significant way at all.' And Helene Donnelly, who is helping the Department of Health draw up whistleblowing training for NHS staff, said: 'I think there's a shift beginning. 'But when it filters down to the frontline staff, I think there's been very little change.' In a victory for whistleblowers, Dr Mattu was cleared last Thursday of any wrongdoing. Coventry and Warwickshire NHS trust – which runs Walgrave Hospital – had pursued him through employment tribunals, running up a bill of £10million. But there are fears that there are many other cases of whistleblowers being suspended. Dr O'Keefe raised concerns about a patient who suffered a brain injury after becoming disconnected from a ventilator for more than ten minutes. He was suspended after being accused of bullying colleagues. Dr Ahmed spoke out about the quality of surgery at Alder Hey in 2009. He was suspended when the hospital ruled him to be 'suicidal'. The British Medical Association rejects that assessment. A Department of Health spokesman said: 'NHS staff who have the courage and integrity to speak out in the interests of patient safety must be protected and listened to. The Secretary of State has written to all trusts to remind them of their responsibilities in this important area.' Gary Walker . The former chief executive of United Lincolnshire Trust was sacked in 2010 after raising concerns about care and made to sign a gagging order.He says he was offered a £500,000 severance deal to keep quiet. The trust was later placed under investigation by health chiefs over its high mortality rates. But Mr Walker says he will never again be able to work in the NHS as managers don't trust him not to speak out. Edwin Jesudason . A leading paediatric surgeon, Dr Jesudason was forced out in 2010 after warning that babies were dying needlessly at Alder Hey children's hospital. His concerns were vindicated in a damning review of the hospital earlier this year which warned of safety problems due to  inexperienced staff.Sandra Haynes-Kirkbright . MRS Haynes-Kirkbright was an employee helping to compile hospital death rates when she claimed bosses at Royal Wolverhampton Hospital were fiddling figures. She was suspended and received a letter saying she could be sacked.  After the Mail drew attention to her case, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he would ensure all action against her was frozen. But she says she is still under investigation. David Ore . The NHS manager was sacked from Dudley Group hospitals after telling bosses that children and vulnerable adults were being abused. He said they were routinely restrained and shut away in cubicles for up to 12 hours with no food or drink. Mr Ore was suspended then formally dismissed last year. He said he had been treated worse than a 'common criminal'.","Whistleblowers say nothing has changed over the last year .

In fact, one in ten have never cleaned out their medicine cabinet and more than one in five have only checked it in the last five years. Almost a quarter of Brits would be willing to risk taking vitamins or supplements that were out of date, but many don't even check the dates. But those who want to try and keep food fresh, tend to do so by either freezing what they want to keep or wrap it all in cling film and put it in the refrigerator. And the majority of Brits will remember to store their meat separately than together. The medicine cabinet has also been found to receive little attention when it comes to checking the use by date of vitamins and supplements. Dr Sarah Brewer, GP, said 'Always check use-by-dates. 'In most cases an out of date supplement won't cause any harm, but the levels of vitamins will be reduced and in the case of herbals, the level of active plant substances will have deteriorated so a dose no longer supplies the same benefits. 'Don't panic. foil-sealed medicines and supplements will generally keep fresher for longer than those supplied in a bottle or tub.'","Research into what's clogging up the nation's fridges and freezers .

A neighbour added: 'He pulled up outside and he was blowing on the horn. 'Then he got out, went to the boot and got a cricket bat out, it looked new, I think it still had the labels on.' The damage to the front door of the home is visible in this picture . Since taking over as Liverpool manager, Brendan Rodgers has undergone an image makeover to match the glamour of one of the top jobs in football. Rodgers has apparently had his teeth whitened and lost a noticeable amount of weight, as well as moving from the family home into a £1.2million flat. The father-of-two has spent thousands of pounds on having his teeth whitened and lost weight after regularly exercising at the club's Melwood training   ground. Mr Rodgers has also moved out of the house he shared with wife Susan, according to The Sun's Guy Patrick, and bought a luxury flat in an upmarket suburb   of the city for £1.2million. Ms Hind is divorcing her husband of five years Steven but Rodgers has denied having a relationship with Ms Hind. A spokesman for Merseyside Police said: 'Merseyside Police can confirm a patrol attended a property in Birkdale on Monday, 14 April following a report of a disturbance. Officers were called at approximately 5.30pm to a report of a man with cricket bat damaging the front door of a property. 'Officers attended but the man had left the scene. People in the property were spoken to about the incident and they did not wish to make a complaint.' Mr Rogers met his wife when he was a young player at Reading Football Club and the couple have two children, Oldham Athletic footballer Anton, 20, and   daughter Mischa,17. He has previously described his wife as 'patient' and 'supportive'.

"By . Ruth Sunderland, Associate City Editor . London is now ‘a country of its own’ with property prices in a different league to the rest of the nation after home values in the capital rose by nearly 30 per cent last year. Property prices surged by 29.5 per cent to an average of £473,500 in the 12 months to the end of March, according to estate agency chain Haart. It means that a typical house or flat in the capital has risen by nearly £108,000 in just one year, compared with an average London salary of £36,000. A typical house or flat in the capital has risen by nearly £108,000 in just one year, compared with an average London salary of £36,000 (File picture) West London, including upmarket areas such as Notting Hill and Kensington, is the biggest hotspot, with prices surging by nearly 63 per cent annually and by nearly 6 per cent alone in February. Prices in the capital are rising at a much higher rate than in the provinces due to an influx of wealthy overseas buyers, who see prime London property as a safe haven for their money. The number of new buyers in London was up by a third and the number of first time purchasers rose by just under 44 per cent annually, despite the financial difficulties for many young people of getting a foot on the ladder. ‘London is now a country of its own in property market terms,’ said Paul Smith, the chief executive of Haart. ‘Foreign investment continues to flood in – people know there is no more lucrative place in the world to invest your money and see outstanding returns.’ ‘Growth is spreading like glue across the country, too,’ he added. Kensington & Chelsea in west London is a hotspot for expensive houses - this one sold for £17m (File picture) Home values nationwide rose by 7.4 per cent to £195,511, but by 9.8 per cent for first time buyers to £159,749, according the Haart figures, drawn from reports from more than 100 agencies across the country. The heady increases are being driven by an imbalance of supply and demand. The number of new properties for sale went up by just 1.8 per cent over the year, but that was heavily outstripped by a 24.5 per cent increase in the number of new buyers. ‘Open house weekends are now commonplace,‘ said Smith. ‘We hold around 240 every weekend.’ The latest housing market statistics from Haart, the UK’s largest independent network of estate agents, come hard on the heels of data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) last week showing house price inflation of 17.7 per cent in London and 9.7 per cent across England as a whole. In parts of the country, however, growth is still much slower. The ONS found Scotland clocked up an increase of just 2.4 per cent, Northern Ireland registered 2.8 per cent and there was a rise of just 2.9 per cent in the Northeast. Government measures to assist first-time buyers, such as the Help to Buy scheme, which offers subsidies on property purchases up to £600,000, have been blamed for creating the risk of a new housing bubble. In parts of the country, however, growth is still much slower. Scotland saw an increase of just 2.4 per cent, Northern Ireland 2.8 per cent and just 2.9 per cent in the North East (File picture) Dr Howard Archer, the chief European and UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said that talk of a bubble in London is ‘already fully justified’ and added that concerns are being stoked about a general bubble across the country as price rises become more widespread. The International Monetary Fund earlier this month urged the Bank of England to be vigilant over rapidly rising house prices. Jose Vinals, the fund’s head of financial stability, said that the Bank’s Financial Policy Committee needs to make a judgment ‘at some stage’ to intervene to cool down the housing market.","Average property in the capital now costs £473,500 .

"By . Ian Drury, Defence Correspondent . It is a feud which began in the 18th century, when the crew of HMS Bounty mutinied. But after 225 years, descendants of Lieutenant William Bligh, the captain of the ship, and his rebellious first mate Fletcher Christian will finally make peace. The dispute dates back to the mutiny on His Majesty’s Armed Vessel Bounty on April 28, 1789, when Christian and 17 crew members seized the ship, casting Bligh and 18 loyal shipmates adrift in the Pacific. ""The Loyal Men of the Bounty"" showing HMS Bounty leaving her infamous Captain Bligh adrift in small boat with cadre of loyal men somewhere near Pitcarn Island . Bligh and his crew managed to sail nearly 4,000 miles to Timor in seven weeks with no charts and few provisions. Christian and his men hid from the Royal Navy with their Tahitian ‘wives’ on Pitcairn island in the south Pacific, which their descendants still inhabit today. Now Maurice Bligh, 71, the great-great-great-grandson of Captain Bligh, is preparing to meet Jacqui Christian, 44, a direct relative of the sailor who led the rebellion. HMS Bounty before the mutiny that left Lieutenant William Bligh, the captain of the ship, adrift with 18 of his crew . The pair will shake hands in January next year, and then celebrate the 225th anniversary of the settlers’ landing on Pitcairn. Miss Christian will hand back a bible – long known as Bligh’s  Bible – which was taken from the captain’s cabin on the Bounty. Mr Bligh, from Sittingbourne, Kent, will then return the bible as an act of friendship to the Pitcairn islanders to end the feud. Historians have described the stand-off between the Blighs and the Christians as like ‘rival football teams’, with animosity simmering down the generations.

"By . Chris Pleasance . Doctors in India were shocked to find 12 gold bars inside the stomach of a businessman who was admitted after complaining of pains. The 63-year-old man went to a hospital in Delhi earlier this month saying he had swallowed a cap from a water bottle and wanted it removed from his body. He also complained of pain and vomiting prompting surgeons to operate, when they discovered the hoard though to be worth around £13,900. Warning graphic content . Pictures have emerged of 12 gold bars removed from inside an Indian businessman after he swallowed them . The man went to hospital saying he had swallowed a plastic bottle cap and asking for it to be removed . The man was vomiting so doctors decided to operate, but when they opened him up they found the bars . Doctors discovered a total of 12 gold bars, each weighing 33g which were discovered in his stomach rather than a bottle cap, it has been reported. And now it is understood that customs officials have questioned the man and the gold has been confiscated. Senior consulting surgeon at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Dehli Dr C S Ramachandran told the Indian Express: 'He approached us on April 7 seeking surgery to remove a water bottle cap which he claimed he had accidentally swallowed. 'We got an X-ray done and it didn’t appear to be a cap. As the gold bars got stacked one behind the other it appeared to be a metal. We were shocked to find not one but 12 gold biscuits in his abdomen. Customs officials were called and questioned the man, before confiscating the gold . Based on today's gold prices, the 33g bars would be worth nearly $2000 (£1,190) each . 'If it would have stayed inside for couple of more days, it would have led to severe bleeding and rupture of the intestine and septicemia.' The businessman was thought to be a known patient at the hospital. India is one of the world's largest consumers of gold but has recently tightened regulations on gold imports following a rise in smuggling. The import tax on gold has been increased three times to try and subdue demand for the metal.","The 63-year-old told doctors he swallowed a water bottle cap .

"By . Ashley Collman . Star witness: Mary Quin is set to take the stand this week in the federal trial against 'terror preacher' Abu Hamza. Quin recorded Hamza confessing to a terror plot she was the victim of in 1998 . A tech CEO is set to take the stand this week as a star witness in the trial against terror preacher Abu Hamza. New Zealand-born Mary Quin, 59, was part of a group of 16 who were kidnapped crossing the desert in Yemen in 1998. Quin, now the CEO of Callaghan Innovation, made it out alive, but four in her group died and she vowed revenge against the person responsible. Her quest eventually led her to Hamza, when she confronted him at his mosque in Finsbury Park, London. Her . recording of their meeting is one of the key points of evidence as the . U.S. seeks to put the Islamic cleric behind bars for life on 11 . terrorism charges. Quin . described the terrifying hostage situation, and her quest to bring the . person responsible to justice, in her book 'Kidnapped in Yemen'. In . the book, Quin writes that she and 15 others were crossing the desert . in Yemen when all of a sudden a heavily-armed group of men wearing masks . ambushed them and took away their passports. A few hours later, a group of vehicles approached and Quin hoped a deal had been struck to secure their release. However, the group of vehicles were actually government troops who started a firefight with the terrorists. Justice: Hamza was extradited to the U.S. in October 2012 and is currently facing 11 terrorism charges. He previously preached at a mosque in London's Finsbury Park. Pictured above in court on April 14 . The ensuing fight resulted in the death of four of the hostages, including Brits Margaret Whitehouse and Ruth Williamson. Memoir: Quin wrote about being ambushed by a terror group in her book 'Kidnapped in Yemen' After about an hour of gunfire, the man guarding Quin was injured and she went to seize his Kalashnikov. 'I want that gun, you little b****,' Quin bravely yelled at him, before running to safety with the Yemeni troops. After . that harrowing day, Quin focused on whoever was responsible for the . deadly kidnapping, studying news reports and speaking with diplomats, . FBI agents and the ex-Prime Minister of Yemen. The name that always came up was Abu Hamza, whose associate Abu Hassan led the group. When . she figured out that he preached at a mosque in London's Finsbury Park, . Quin decided to ask him about his role in the plan. First she sent emails, but when he didn't reply she decided to fly to London and see him in person. She nervously waited in a pub across the street from the mosque for him to arrive. When she finally saw him approach the building, Quin admits that she was overwhlemed with the feeling that she should leave. But Quin pushed on and stopped the preacher in his tracks. 'My . name is Mary Quin,' she said. 'I arrived from America this morning in . the hope of speaking with you. Did you read the emails I sent?' Hamza . agreed to speak with her for 15 minutes the following Sunday and when . she showed up, Quin was surprised to find Hamza in his office with four . small children sitting on the floor nearby. Hamza . quickly launched into a tirade about Algeria, but Quin stopped his rant . by confessing that she was one of the tourists taken hostage in 1998. 'I am surprised that you would have come here,' Hamza said smiling. 'Very surprised.' Hamza has long been a reviled figure in the UK where he was reported to have cost taxpayers Â£2.75million pounds in welfare and council housing. Pictured above preaching outside of his London mosque in March 2004 . Quin then asked if it was ok to record their chat, and Hamza surprisingly agreed. On . tape, he admitted to providing Hassan with a satellite phone and to . being in contact with him during the ambush. The plan was to exchange the tourists for terror suspects, including Hamza's son and step-son. He said he regretted . the way things turned out, and that the team was ordered to keep the . hostages alive and safe. 'We never thought it would be that bad,' he said. What was supposed to be a quick 15 minute talk ended up lasting nearly an hour. At . the end of the meeting, Quin says she thanked Hamza for his time and . asked if she could follow up with him in the future if he had more . questions. 'He gave me his mobile phone number,' Quin says. The . 56-year-old preacher has long been a reviled figure in the UK, where he . preached a strict interpretation of Islam at his mosque. 'Allah . likes those who believe in Him who kill those who not believe in Him. Alla likes that. So if you Muslims don't like that because you hate the . blood, there is something wrong with you,' he once said in a sermon. He also is estimated to have cost Britain Â£2.75million in welfare payments and council housing. He was extradicted in October 2012 to face charges in the U.S.","Mary Quin was kidnapped along with 15 others on a trip to Yemen in 1998 .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . They are remembered as the 'noble six hundred' who rode 'into the mouth of Hell' with unwavering valour in one of the British military's most infamous disasters. The bravery and unquestioning loyalty exhibited in the doomed Charge of the Light Brigade - immortalised by Alfred, Lord Tennyson in his poem of the same name - caused a sensation in Victorian Britain when news reached home. But it has now emerged that, even as the order was given, it was obvious to the rank and file risking their lives in the face of Russian artillery that - in Tennyson's words - 'someone had blunder'd'. Wild charge: The letters have shown ordinary soldiers' reactions to the Charge of the Light Brigade. The above picture shows a 1936 film adaptation . Letters written by some of the 673 soldiers involved in the ill-fated assault have been unearthed 150 years after the assault, which took place during the Crimean War in 1854. They describe the folly of the order to charge into the famed 'Valley of Death' - surrounded on three sides by massed Russian forces - but also show how the brave English forces threw themselves into the battle nonetheless. One correspondent referred to the order - which is thought to have been given because of a misunderstanding - as 'perfect madness'. Another, identified as Private Thomas Williams of the 11th Hussars, clearly thought the command was an accident. Writing to his parents in England, he said: 'I could see what would be the result of it, and so could all of us; but of course, as we had got the order, it was our duty to obey. Carnage: The Charge of the Light Brigade, in 1854, is one of Britain's most notorious military disasters . 'I do not wish to boast too much; but I can safely say that there was not a man in the Light Brigade that day but what did his duty to his Queen and country.' The correspondence was unearthed by Crimean War historian Anthony Dawson, who scoured newspaper archives to find published accounts from the soldiers involved. The full collection is due to be published this June in a book called Letters from the Light Brigade. Among the unnamed witnesses to the carnage were an unnamed officer from the 17th Lancers, who described the unblinking loyalty of his comrades. He wrote: 'We all knew the thing was desperate before we started, and it was even worse than we thought... However there was no hesitation, down our fellows went at a gallop - through a fire in front and on both flanks, which emptied our saddles and knocked over our horses by scores.' Chaos: The Light Brigade was decimated by Russia artillery fire on three flanks . The charge, one of the best-known blunders in British military history, came in the thick of the Battle of Balaclava, near Sevastopol in Crimea - then part of Imperial Russia. Although it only lasted around 20 minutes, the attack saw almost a fifth of the Light Brigade killed, and hundreds more wounded. It is thought to have come about after Lord Lucan and the Earl of Cardigan, who were in charge of the cavalry in the battle, were given a confusing order by Lord Raglan, the British commander. The Light Brigade had been meant to ride to the rescue of British guns which had been captured and were being dragged away by Russian forces. But due to a misunderstanding they instead though they had been given the suicidal task of capturing well-defended Russian guns much further away. As they rode towards the distant emplacement, their men were torn apart by Russian marksmen and shell fire. To the surprise of their foes, they did manage to reach the massed guns and inflict some damage, but were so depleted that they had to turn back and retreat. Lord Tennyson's poem, written based on breathless newspaper dispatches from the front, memorably expressed the bravery of ordinary soldiers as they rode to their doom. It captured the public mood, and was distributed to soldiers in Crimea while they were still fighting. Half a league, half a league/ Half a league onward,All in the valley of Death/ Rode the six hundred.""Forward, the Light Brigade! / ""Charge for the guns!"" he said:Into the valley of Death / Rode the six hundred.""Forward, the Light Brigade!"" / Was there a man dismay'd?Not tho' the soldier knew / Someone had blunder'd:Theirs not to make reply, / Theirs not to reason why,Theirs but to do and die: / Into the valley of DeathRode the six hundred.Cannon to right of them, / Cannon to left of them,Cannon in front of them / Volley'd and thunder'd;Storm'd at with shot and shell, / Boldly they rode and well,Into the jaws of Death, / Into the mouth of HellRode the six hundred.Flash'd all their sabres bare, / Flash'd as they turn'd in air,Sabring the gunners there, / Charging an army, whileAll the world wonder'd: / Plunged in the battery-smokeRight thro' the line they broke; / Cossack and RussianReel'd from the sabre stroke / Shatter'd and sunder'd.Then they rode back, but not / Not the six hundred.Cannon to right of them, / Cannon to left of them,Cannon behind them / Volley'd and thunder'd;Storm'd at with shot and shell, / While horse and hero fell,They that had fought so well / Came thro' the jaws of DeathBack from the mouth of Hell, / All that was left of them,Left of six hundred.When can their glory fade? / O the wild charge they made!All the world wondered. / Honor the charge they made,Honour the Light Brigade, / Noble six hundred.","Bloody Crimean War charge in 1854 is an infamous military blunder .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A New York City cab driver who ran over a British tourist in midtown Manhattan last year - causing her to lose one of her legs - is back on the road. Following the incident that left Leicester beauty queen Sian Green without a leg, cabbie Mohammed Faysal Himon told reporters that the incident was so horrified by the incident that he didn't want to be a cab driver anymore. However, he reportedly has been back behind the wheel for months. Scroll down for video . Sian . Green (left), 23, is suing the city of New York for $27.5m because she claims cabbie Faysal Himon (right) shouldn't have been driving when he crashed into her leading to the amputation of her left leg . On the mend: Green, left, is pictured with her friends at a party in her native England in October - two months after the accident . 'He has been driving regularly, . uneventfully — thank God — and just doing what he has to do,' Himon’s . lawyer, Cynthia Fisher, told The New York Post. In . August of 2013, the cab Himon was driving jumped the curb near West . 49th Street in Manhattan and hit Green, 25, who was sightseeing with a . friend. Himon claimed . at the time that he was cutoff by a man on a bicycle, 41-year-old . Kenneth Olivo, and then sped up to try and get around him, which caused . him to lose control of the vehicle and jump the curb. Vivacious: Green's attorney stated that since returning home to the UK, the 23-year-old has been making great progress in her recovery . Reckless: The Green family are convinced that the incident that left Sian (left) without a leg was not an accident, but rather the result of a negligent act . Following . the incident, New York City's Taxi and Limousine Commission suspended . Himon's license for 30 days. However, no charges were ever filed against . him, so the Commission was forced to reinstate his license. After . the Commission had to reinstate Himon's license, officials asked him to . voluntarily surrender it, according to a spokesman for the TLC. He . refused. Himon, a . Bangladeshi native who has been in America for about five years, has a . history of dangerous driving - even Himon thinks he's a bad driver, he . admitted to the Post last year. Since 2011, Himon has been cited for running a red light and for driving 65 mph in a 45-mph zone, amongst other citations. Since returning to work, Himon's driving record is clean. Investigation: No charges were filed against the taxi driver in the incident, who reportedly lost control of car after an argument with a cyclist and ploughed into Miss Green . Green, meanwhile, is still adjusting to life as an amputee. 'Back at home in Leicester at the . end of September, the reality of being an amputee hit me,' she wrote . last week in The Sun newspaper of London, recalling 'terrifying . flashbacks' of the incident. 'I had to use crutches or a wheelchair to get . around, and I couldn’t drive my car anymore. I had no independence, and I . found that very hard.' Green . is pursuing a $27.5 million lawsuit against Himon and the City of New . York - a lawsuit she filed after law enforcement officials announced . that Himon wouldn't face any criminal charges. Green's lawsuit against the city focuses on the fact that Himon's hack license should have been suspended before the August 20 . accident because of his prior driving violations. Prosecutors told Green in November that there wasn't . enough evidence to demonstrate that Himon intended to hit her. After it was . announced in the November that no criminal charges would be brought . against Himon, Green's lawyer released a statement in which he said his . client was continuing to make progress in her recovery after returning . to the U.K. ‘While . she is incredibly dismayed by this decision, she does not let it affect . her positive spirit, unbelievable strength and incredible poise, which . she demonstrated to the world throughout this ordeal,’ the statement . from Daniel Marchese read. Hero: Green said if it wasn't for the actions of strangers who rushed to help she wouldn't have survived the accident. David Justino (right) used a belt to make a  tourniquet for her leg, while celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz (left) also raced to the scene . He insists that . the incident that has left his young client without a leg is not an . accident, but rather the result of ‘a negligent act of calculated . recklessness.’ In an interview on the Today Show in September, Green said she plans to return to New York someday. She said: 'I hope to come back one day. It’s not the city’s . fault. It was the man who made a bad choice, I can’t blame the city for . that.  It’s a beautiful city and I’d love to come back.' The aspiring model told the New York Post after being discharged from the hospital that she will not let the horrific incident . destroy her dreams. Green's . Facebook account shows that the 23-year-old woman has been keeping . busy, spending time with friends and attending parties. One . picture posted in October showed the 23-year-old employee of the Hugo . Boss fashion house posing in a green dress with a pair of girlfriends at . a soiree while holding onto a walker. The crash happened on the second day of her trip to the city and she did not get to do the things she wanted. 'The only thing I really wanted to do was go to the top of the Empire . State Building,' she said. 'I wanted to go shopping, meet up with a few friends, do the . typical New York things.' Aspirations: Sian Green hoped to become a model and was training to be a buyer for Hugo Boss . Passersby rushed to help Miss Green . immediately after the incident. Plumber David Justino used his belt to . make a life-saving tourniquet for her leg while a pizza truck owner . raced to put her foot on ice. They . were also helped by celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, better known on U.S. TV . as Dr Oz, who hurried to the scene from his nearby office. Her appearance in the Today studio took place just one block from the scene of the crash. During . her appearance on the Today show, Green admitted that she had had . some unpleasant flashbacks: 'I haven't been out in five weeks. It takes . me back a little bit, even when I see a yellow car.... But I'll get . there.' The 23-year-old . brunette talked about her memories of the accident. 'I couldn't move,' she said. 'It was one of those things. If I had gone left, it would have . gotten me, if I had gone right, it would've gotten me.' Friends and relatives say Green's naturally good-spirited nature has helped her through a hard time. 'It's quite difficult, but she's a very optimistic person,' Sian's sister Stacey told Today. 'She just takes it day by day.' Green said her most vivid memory of the day . is walking around the city, getting a drink, going to Times Square and . having a great time with her best friend, Keshia Warren. Miss . Green paid tribute to her friend, who was with her during the accident . and hasn't left her side since. 'She's been my rock,' Green said. 'I . couldn't do half the things without her, I really couldn't.'","Sian Green, 23, had to have her left leg amputated after she was hit by a cab outside Rockefeller Center on August 20, 2013 .

"By . Laura Clark . NUT members threaten a mass campaign of non-compliance over new tests for children . Teachers are planning to boycott tests for four-year-olds which they claim will harm children's development. Members of the National Union of Teachers (NUT) are threatening a mass campaign of non-compliance with the tests, as well as a boycott of a new reading check for six-year-olds. They have claimed the reforms are 'dangerous' to children's education. Ministers announced plans last month . for four-year-olds to be given a 'baseline' assessment in counting and . letter and picture recognition within weeks of starting in the reception . class. The tests are . intended to measure how well primary schools help their pupils progress . until they leave at age 11 and expose 'coasting' teachers. Schools will be able to use the tests from September next year and they will become standard across the system in 2016. But . NUT members, meeting in Brighton for their annual conference, will . today call for the abolition of early testing, claiming it 'creates an . unhealthy environment of competition' and 'does little but engender a . feeling of failure in children and pressure on teachers'. They . will also call for a return to play-based lessons for children up to . the age of seven to counter a drive for 'too much  too soon'. Hazel . Danson, a member of the NUT's executive and a primary school teacher . from Huddersfield, said there was a 'groundswell of feeling' against . testing in early education. 'This notion that you just teach young . children more stuff earlier and that will somehow improve standards, it . won't work,' she said. 'I would have every confidence that a ballot on . this issue would be very strongly supported.' Schools will be able to use the tests from September next year and they will become standard across the system in 2016 . Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw recently launched a scathing attack on the 'middle-class prejudice' that structured learning is damaging for young children, and called for more places for two-year-olds at school-based nurseries. A spokesman for the Department for Education said: 'We are working with teachers to raise the bar to improve standards in primary schools and introduce a proper measure of progress.'","NUT members threaten a mass campaign of non-compliance .

"By . Wills Robinson . A couple who won £161m on the lottery has donated £3m to the Scottish Independence campaign, effectively bankrolling their push to be separated from the UK. Colin and Chris Weir from Ayrshire, Scotland, have become Britain's biggest political donors in the past 15 months, after handing over huge sums to Alex Salmond and the Yes vote. The pair, who scooped the huge Euromillions jackpot in 2011, have overtaken Tory donor, Michael Farmer, founder of the RK Capital hedge fund. Political donors: Colin Weir and Chris Weir, from Largs in Ayrshire, have given £3m of their Euromillions jackpot to the Yes Campaign in Scotland . Financial backing: They are effectively bankrolling the pro-independence movement, led by First Minister Alex Salmond . Donations made by individuals (Sunday Times Rich List) 1. Colin and Chris Weir: £3,000,000 (Yes Scotland/SNP) 2. Michael Farmer: £1,052,304 (Conservative) 3. James Lupton: £1,027,800 (Conservative) 4.

Andrew Law: £307,077 (Conservative) 9. Lord Bamford and family: £299,687 (Conservative) 10. Lord Palumbo of Southwark: £286,552 (Liberal Democrats) The couple, who have been married for more than 30 years, have given at least £2m to the SNP and the Yes Scotland Campaign in the last few months. It is a massive increase on the £1m the pair handed over in 2013. Colin, who was an STV cameraman, and his wife Chris, a nursing manager, are now completely funding the pro-independence campaign . They have raked in more than three times the amount of donations received by the opposing Better Together campaign. Analysis by the Sunday Times has shown the Scottish referendum has captured around 30 per cent of political donations since the beginning of 2013. Yes Scotland has £2m, all from the Weirs, while the opposing Better Together Campaign only has £863,000. The surge in funds has prompted the Yes vote to carry out one of the country's biggest advertising campaigns. The opposing Better Together campaign, led by former Chancellor Alastair Darling, has struggled to come up with similar funds to their rivals. A poll conducted by the pro-independence political website Wings Over Scotland earlier this month . found that when the 14 per cent of voters who are undecided are . excluded, 47 per cent intend to vote yes and 53 per cent no. Women voters are currently far less . likely to support independence than men, with the most recent poll . finding 27 per cent intend to vote ‘Yes’ compared with 46 per cent of . men. To cement his appeal, . Mr  Salmond also pledged ‘high quality, universal childcare  and early . learning for all of Scotland’s children’. The promise comes in addition . to a previous flagship pledge to extend free childcare. However other polls have suggested the vote could be neck-and-neck. It was also revealed today that Alex Salmond wants Prince Charles to be crowned King of Scots in a separate coronation. The First Minister says monarchs should be crowned in both England and Scotland if he succeeds in breaking up the UK. At the same time Mr Salmond, in a strong signal to republicans in his own party, has firmly ruled out a future referendum on ditching the monarchy. Rich: The pair from Largs, Ayrshire, became Britain's biggest jackpot winners in 2011 when they took home just over £161m . Going forward: Polls predicting the outcome of September's referendum have begun to balance out after a surge in support for Alex Salmond .","Colin and Chris Weir have donated seven-figure sum since victory in 2011 .

"By . Alex Greig . Lakeside meth lab: Madhu Dutta is accused of attempting to set up a meth lab in his million-dollar home . Ohio police have arrested the owner of a luxurious lakeside home in which the makings of a sophisticated  methamphetamine lab were discovered Wednesday night. Inside the home, police found equipment and chemicals for a 'thionyl/chloride method' lab, the first of its kind to be found in Ohio. Madhu Dutta, 51, was arrested Thursday at 3675 East Lake Road in Sheffield Lake for possessing the chemicals and equipment for making methamphetamine. Officers had been investigating . suspicious activity at the house since August 2013, but new information . prompted them to obtain a warrant to search the home. Also discovered on the property were three handguns, 11 shotguns and a large quantity of ammunition, reports Fox 8. Chief . Deputy Dennis Cavanaugh said that while the lab wasn't fully . functioning, Dutta was in possession of enough chemicals and equipment . to warrant the charges, reports WKYC. The . thionyl method is unique, Cavanaugh said, because of 'the type of . system, the chemicals being used, the specific type of equipment, and . you have to have some knowledge or ability to be able to do this.' Affluent area: The million-dollar home owned by Madhu Dutta . Lake views: The tasteful mansion is home to Madhu Dutta, who lives there alone . There goes the neighborhood: Neighbors in the affluent area were shocked that such a grand home could be the site of a methamphetamine lab . Commercial grade: The chemicals stockpiled by Dutta were for use in a sophisticated meth lab, say police . He added that thionyl/chloride method labs are 'extremely toxic'. The . more common method for cooking the drug is known as the one-pot method, . or 'shake and bake,' which uses household chemicals, unlike the . commercial grade chemicals found in Dutta's home. According to ABC News, Dutta's property in the affluent lakeside area was purchased for $1,125,000 last year. Neighbors were shocked by the arrest of their neighbor. Weapons: Police found three handguns and 11 shotguns in the home, as well as ammunition . Evidence: A hydrogen tank and generator were discovered, in addition to bottles of chloroform and other chemicals related to the thionyl/chloride method of manufacturing meth . 'Around the lake the properties are expensive,' Cavanaugh told ABC News. 'I don't care where you are in this county or the state, you never know when anything like this is going to happen.' Dutta was charged with two counts of illegal assembly or possession of chemicals for the manufacture of drugs and one count of permitting drug abuse. Dutta pleaded not guilty on April 17 and is scheduled for a preliminary hearing on April 24.","Police discovered equipment and chemicals for making methamphetamine in a million-dollar Ohio home .

"By . SIMON JONES . Remy heads list of Atletico targets as Champions League semi-finalists chase Lukaku, Hernandez and Soldado . Chelsea have joined the race for Everton defender John Stones but will face a difficult task prising him away. Arsenal also have an interest in the 19-year-old, who is being tipped as an outsider for Roy Hodgson's World Cup training squad. Stones was bought from Barnsley by David Moyes in January 2013 for a £3million fee, heading off interest from then-Wigan manager Roberto Martinez and Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United. Although he was playing as a right back, Moyes and Martinez recognised Stones would become a centre back and he is showing how in his performances of late. Arsenal have watched the England U21 defender closely and like his ability to bring the ball out of defence which has come to the fore this season. In demand: Young Everton defender John Stones is wanted by both London giants, Chelsea and Arsenal . Chelsea have good youth players coming through but Stones is ahead of them after gaining Premier League experience. Both clubs would like to make an offer but Everton are not looking to sell any of their stars as they continue to make giant strides towards Champions League qualification. Whereas in the past they would be vulnerable to any sizeable bid, the club is utilising increased TV money to stabilise and build for the future. Ross Barkley is also inevitably wanted by Premier League rivals but Everton believe the player wants to stay at Goodison for at least another two years before taking stock of where to take his career. By that time they hope to have added more than Champions League qualification to convince him to stay. Staying put: Everton are confident the much-coveted Ross Barkley intends to stay at Goodison for a while yet . Leicester City scouts are due in Argentina this week to watch Luciano Vietto. The 20-year-old forward, valued at £6miilion, is due to play for Racing Club against Gimnasia La Plata. Leicester are ready to bring in around four new players ahead of their Premier League campaign with a right back and goalkeeper also on their wishlist. Manager Nigel Pearson is keen on Feyenoord's 24-year-old Daryl Janmaat. The Holland defender has rejected new terms at his club and is poised to move to England, although Arsenal have also watched him in recent months. Prospect: Leicester are planning for life in the Premier League with signings such as Luciano Vietto (centre) Liverpool, Arsenal and Everton scouts were all present at PSV Eindhoven's 2-0 home defeat to Feyenoord on Sunday. The game was far from spectacular by all accounts with Feyenoord defenders Joris Mathijsen and Daryl Janmaat on the scoresheet. Everton and Liverpool though have been particularly keen on other Feyenoord defenders Bruno Martins Indi and Stefan de Vrij. Both are expected to be sold this summer. Being monitored: Liverpool, Arsenal and Everton scouts saw Stefan de Vrij (left) and Bruno Martins Indi in action . Stoke City have resumed talks over potential deals for Wolfsburg's Ivica Olic and Mame Biram Diouf of Hannover but look likely to miss out on Olic in particular with his wage demands too high. Olic, 34, has stated this weekend that he is ready to stay at Wolfsburg and that may not be too surprising with his salary at around £75,000 a week and the Germans will offer two years. Diouf is understood to be looking for similar terms to leave Germany for the Premier League after turning down a new contract at Hannover. Bundesliga targets: Stoke are hoping to bring in both Wolfsburg's Ivica Olic and Hannover's Mame Biram Diouf . Both players are out of contract and free to talk to interested clubs abroad. Croat . Olic, who has scored 12 goals in 28 matches for Wolfsburg this season, . told Kicker-Sportmagazin: 'My thought is to stay on at Wolfsburg. I am . expecting to remain at Volkswagen-Arena and be a part of this squad also . in the new Bundesliga 1 season.' Diouf, 26, has interest also from Cardiff City, West Ham and Hamburg - although the latter are struggling financially. Southampton are looking for new takers for Pablo Osvaldo after Juventus indicated he would be returning to St Mary's in the summer. Juve coach Antonio Conte said: 'I can only speak highly of Osvaldo because he works hard and settled into the group well. He will give us a hand from here to the end of the season so we can achieve our objectives.' Southampton had agreed a loan with view to a permanent £15.6million deal but will now be looking to see if there is interest from Spain and other Italian clubs once he returns in the summer. Unwanted: Southampton are desperate to get rid of Pablo Osvaldo, whose loan at Juventus is soon ending . Saints will be looking for new forwards to replace Osvaldo and possibly others. Tottenham . and Arsenal are both keen on Jay Rodriguez although his knee injury may . ensure he stays another season while Tottenham remain interested in a . deal for Adam Lallana also. However, Manchester United are . unlikely to pursue a deal for the England midfielder at this stage. Gaston Ramirez is also expected to return to Serie A. Wigan are the latest club to show a firm interest in Sheffield United centre back Harry Maguire. Manager Uwe Rosler has had scouts check on the 21-year-old, who has also been monitored by Liverpool and Arsenal this season. Rosler also wants a right back with Maguire's team-mate John Brayford a possibility.

"By . Paul Hirst, Press Association . David Moyes accused Manchester United of 'rank and rotten' defending as the Scot endured a hellish return to Goodison Park. Everton strolled to an easy 2-0 win that ended United's hopes of Champions League qualification with four matches remaining.

On the pitch it was a grim day for the United boss as his team suffered their 11th defeat of the season. Phil . Jones blocked Romelu Lukaku's shot with his outstretched arm and . Leighton Baines converted the resulting spot-kick before Alex Buttner . played Kevin Mirallas onside and the Belgian beat David de Gea from a . tight angle. Moyes tried to . put a positive spin on what was a dreadful defeat, but he did not hold . back when giving his assessment of his team's defending for both goals. 'I thought the two goals we conceded today were rank, rotten,' the United boss said. 'The . (first) goal was a big kick up the pitch, it was nodded down and picked . up, and for us to concede a goal like that was terrible. 'The second was a better move but we should have defended it much better that we did. 'We . gave away two terrible goals but prior to that we passed the ball . brilliantly well, kept the ball, had great control of the game. 'What we couldn't do is make enough chances, but we had a great control and we got done by two stupid decisions.'

Signing in: Seamus Coleman gives fans his autograph on his arrival at Goodison Park . Read the match report from Goodison Park here . The . result and the performances of both sides showed just how much United . have regressed under Moyes and how far Everton have come under his . successor Roberto Martinez, who has now collected a record 20 league . wins since moving to Goodison Park. United tested Tim Howard on just two occasions while Everton out-muscled and outclassed their opponents in midfield. Wayne Rooney had a disappointing afternoon in front of goal while Lukaku caused Jonny Evans and Jones problems throughout. Thanks for the support: Everton striker Steven Naismith signs autographs ahead of the match . Moyes, surprisingly, thought his team did not play too badly. 'We played very well in the first half,' said Moyes, who spent 11 years at Everton before moving to Old Trafford. 'We . had passed the ball really well, kept the ball but we didn't have the . final pass, the killer through ball that was needed in the final third. 'I didn't think we deserved to go in 2-0 down at half-time, that's for sure. 'We had good play, good control of the game, and we had the bulk of the ball.' The way we were: Moyes (centre) waves to the fans after walking through the guard of honour after his final match in charge of Everton . Martinez, who became the first Everton boss to do the double over United in 44 years, hailed his team's performance as 'electrifying'. 'This was an important win for our fans,' said the Spaniard. 'We knew that since the 1969-70 season we had never done the double over United and I think that is when we won the league. 'That tells you this group of players is ready to develop. 'That performance was full of energy, it was dynamic on the counter attack. I thought we looked electrifying.' Despite the midweek defeat to Crystal Palace, Everton are just one point short of fourth-placed Arsenal with three matches left. Martinez is refusing to get carried away with talk of his team pipping the Gunners to fourth, though. 'We have another nine points to fight for,' said Martinez.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An American couple in Texas who officially became the parents of two Congolese orphans in June are still fighting to meet their children and have no idea when their family may finally be whole. Laura and Greg Richardson became heartbroken and desperate when the African nation halted all adoptions to America in September before Josias and Mercy could make the trip to the states. Officials in Congo say they fear the kids sent abroad could be mistreated, while the well-off and God-fearing parents of four biological children want the 15- and 18-month old boy and girl out of the war ravaged nation as soon as possible. Eager: Laura Richardson (left with one of her four biological children) is in an adoption nether realm. She and husband Greg officially became the parents of two Congolese orphans in June, but the African nation froze all adoptions to the U.S. before the children could make it to their new home . Great need: The Richardsons have four biological children aged 2 through 8, and decided to adopt from Congo, where 4 million children live as orphans . 'It’s just . heartbreaking,' Laura Richardson told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. 'We . are watching our children grow up in pictures. We don’t know what’s . going on over there, if they are healthy or safe.' The . Richardsons' plight feels all the more frustrating because the couple . had already jumped through all the necessary hoops to officially become . the parents of Josias and Mercy. 'We are legally their parents,' Laura Richardson said. 'It’s irreversible.' But . parents or not, the Richardsons are only able to help raise and nurture . the Congolese children through the prayers and with the hope their . government's dictate will soon be reversed. Their struggle is also a race against time in a sense. While . the children are currently living together at an orphanage, children in . the country face daunting odds just to stay alive on a daily basis. The . Democratic Republic of the Congo is now longer in the heat of its . horrific early 2000s civil war, but the conflict's affects remain acute. 'We . were praying about it for the longest time, trying to figure out where . we were being called,' Laura Richardson told the Star-Telegram. 'We saw . the great need in Congo.' Going to Congo: 'We are just going to meet them and make sure they are OK,' Laura Richardson said. 'We don¿t really expect they will be able to come home at that point' There are an astonishing four million orphans in Congo, where 1 in 7 children die before their fifth birthday. The . Richardsons and families in like situations have until now spent the . months since adoptions were halted to the U.S. simply hoping that their . government officials could find a way to intervene. Now, they've enlisted the help of Texas Senator John Cornyn to try and help in their cause. There is also an online petition to urge congress to take action that has seen over 100,000 signees since April 2. 'The . unexpected delay in the completion of these adoptions has resulted in . over 460 children continuing to languish in institutions without the . care of a permanent family,' reads the letter. For now, the frustrated Richardsons are playing the waiting game. Signs hang on the doors of each of their rooms reading 'Worth the wait.' While willing to wait, the Richardsons are not complacent. They plan to visit the children in Congo next month. 'We are just going to meet them and make sure they are OK,' Laura Richardson said. 'We don’t really expect they will be able to come home at that point.'","Laura and Greg Richardson of Keller, Texas officially adopted Josias and Mercy, who are now 15 months and 18 months respectively, in June .

"By . Joel Christie . Police in Michigan believe a Xanax pill found inside a plastic egg during a pre-school Easter hunt on Wednesday was placed there on purpose as a prank. Authorities say the children at Huron Park Elementary School in Roseville were told to each bring in seven of the plastic eggs, which were to be filled with candy and taped shut. With 30 to 40 students involved, hundreds of the eggs were hidden in the garden by teachers for the hunt. Shocked: Michigan mom Amber Pruchniewski found a generic Xanax pill inside an easter egg her daughter was given at school . Pruchniewski said her daughter (pictured) said her daughter brought several plastic eggs following an Easter hunt at school, and that the prescription-only pill was found inside one of them . Amber Pruchniewski explains in a TV interview how she wants to find out who put the pill in her daughter's Easter egg . Mother Amber Pruchniewski said her four-year-old daughter came home with several that day. When her little girl was going through the findings on the floor, Pruchniewski noticed a white pill among jellybeans in one of the casings. The pill turned out to be single dose of Alprazolam, a generic form of Xanax. 'I just want to know who did it - it's careless,' Pruchniewski told Fox News. She took the pill into the school the next day and tshowed the principal. The police were then brought in. Police Chief Donald Glandon told WWJ-TV . he thinks the incident was 'intentional and criminal', but that it's still . too early to identify a possible suspect. Dangerous: The egg was one of hundreds used in the Easter hunt. Each child at the school were told to bring in seven filled with candy and taped shut .

"By . Matt Lawton . Follow @@Matt_Lawton_DM . Nothing went right for David Moyes yesterday. Not even when it came to escaping a press conference his chastened media officer decided to bring to a sudden and premature end. He attempted to leave through the wrong door, and so had to suffer the ignominy of re-entering the room to try again. Whether Moyes gets the chance to try again this summer remains to be seen, however. Particularly after this; quite possibly the nadir of his managerial career. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch both managers give their views on the game . Wrong one? David Moyes was outclassed by Roberto Martinez (L) at Goodison Park . It was that bad yesterday, however much Manchester United’s troubled manager tried to argue otherwise, and what would have made it all the more uncomfortable for him was the fact that the guy who succeeded him at Goodison Park appears increasingly capable of replacing him again. However bad things have been at United this season, a lack of alternatives has been given as a reason for sticking with Moyes. Jurgen Klopp, Louis van Gaal and Diego Simeone get mentioned regularly but they come with certain risks. Stay of execution: The Grim Reaper looms over Moyes like an uncertain future as part of a promotional stunt . Perhaps they should look instead at what Roberto Martinez is now achieving here. A first league double over United in 44 years and a Premier League points tally that is likely to see Everton break the 70-point barrier that always proved beyond Moyes. Never mind the fact that he secured the FA Cup for Wigan and strikes anyone who encounters him as one of the brightest young managers in the game. He also possesses obvious passion for the English game and seems to have the same star quality as the guy on the other side of Stanley Park. We should not forget that this was how we used to feel about Moyes too, and it might yet be enough to convince the Old Trafford hierarchy that he deserves the opportunity to spend the money that is required to rebuild this stuttering United side. One that got away: Former United target Leighton Baines opened the scoring from the penalty spot . But this felt like the tipping point, the point of no return, and the point where Ed Woodward and the Glazers start to think seriously about an alternative to a man who is discovering  to his cost that it really would have been better to follow the man who followed Sir Alex Ferguson. It is certainly hard to imagine Moyes ever experiencing a more depressing journey home from Goodison than the one he endured last night. His players must have known how much this game meant to him and yet they responded with a lifeless, spineless display. Not for the first time this season, United looked like a team of impostors. Like a side subjected to an invasion of the body snatchers. They looked the same. They just didn’t play the same. Lacklustre: Wayne Rooney came closest to scoring but it was another insipid display from United . It was every bit as abject as that performance against Olympiakos. Every bit as inept as their recent efforts against Liverpool. If Moyes can take anything from this game, it is the fact that it justified his eagerness to sign Leighton Baines. Everton’s full-backs, two players who were among the more astute purchases Moyes made in his 11 years at this club, performed key roles in securing this victory. Bad to worse: David de Gea reacts to Everton's second goal, which condemned Manchester United to an 11th loss this season . Baines and Seamus Coleman were terrific. And, more significantly, they were in a different league from the two individuals endeavouring to perform the sale roles for United. Alexander Buttner and Chris Smalling? In fairness to Smalling he remains a decent centre half. But they were both sorry excuses for United players on this occasion. But will Moyes be given the chance to address these and other issues? Will he be forgiven for allowing United to slip so far down from the summit of English football? He was supposed to be trading up when he left Everton last May, not taking over a team now 12 points adrift of the one he left behind. Even if he does have a game in hand.","David Moyes lost 2-0 to Everton on his return to Goodison Park .

He endured a miserable day as the home side won 2-0 thanks to a Leighton Baines penalty and a goal by Kevin Mirallas before half-time and there were gleeful chants of, 'You're getting sacked in the morning' from the Everton supporters. Moyes afterwards called his centre half Phil Jones 'stupid' after the defender gave away the penalty for handball in the first half but also bizarrely claimed that his side controlled the game.

It was disappointment how we played in the final third though. ‘I couldn’t fault how we played, we kept the ball incredibly well.' United will not feature in the Champions League next season and may not even make the Europa League after another debilitating defeat. Moyes added: ‘It does hurt, we want to be in Champions League and we must get back into it as quickly as we can.

The Scot also got on the wrong side of . the Toffees when he bid for Leighton Baines in the summer and, . eventually, bought Marouane Fellaini, and that may have prompted the . fans' abuse outisde the ground and as he walked out of the tunnel. Chairman Bill Kenwright - a stauch . ally of Moyes's during his time in charge at Goodison - has made no . comment, while Martinez dedicates just a paragraph to his predecessor. However, . Everton club captain Phil Jagielka wrote in his programme column before the match: . 'Today was never going to be an ordinary game between us. The return to . Goodison of our former boss and some of his staff undoubtedly adds to . the occasion. 'David Moyes . brought me to Everton and I'll always be grateful to him for that.

Steve Round, Jimmy Lumsden, Chris Woods, Phil Neville, not to mention . Marouane Fellaini! 'All we are focusing on as players is the three points.' Thanks for the support: Everton striker Steven Naismith signs autographs ahead of the match . Martinez admitted that he was grateful to Moyes for the job he had done before him at Everton but also felt for the fans who gave the Scot a less than welcome reception. 'Now, obviously, he is the Manchester United manager and there is a big rivalry fighting for the same aims as Everton so you can expect that it is going to be a very much competitive atmosphere here,' he said. 'But everyone knows the job that David Moyes did at Everton will never be forgotten and clearly I will have a lot to thank him (for).' The Spaniard was happy with the workrate of his players as they overcame a United side that had far more possession. 'We knew that we were facing a very good side,' he added. 'Away from home they have a terrific record and in that respect we had three games in eight days and it was important that we were focused and we were very clear in what we wanted to do and I think we did that. 'We controlled the aspects of the game that we wanted to do. 'I thought we were electrifying on the counter attack and I thought the way that we got in the final third was very enjoyable from that respect and then we worked extremely hard to keep a clean sheet.'

"By . Jill Reilly . rank Humphreys, 51, had sex with daughter Eleanor Jackson, 23 after she tracked him down on Facebook . A paedophile had sex with a daughter he had put up for adoption after she tracked him down on Facebook. Eleanor Jackson, 23, was taken from her biological father Frank Humphreys, 51, when she was just 17 months old, a court heard. But when she traced him as an adult the pair began a sexual relationship. Humphreys and his daughter both pleaded guilty to incest . Humphreys, of Cleator Moor, Cumbria, was jailed at Carlisle Crown Court for 21 months. The . court heard that the pair had been estranged for a number of years . since Jackson was put up for adoption when she was just 17-months-old. However, . Tim Brennand, prosecuting, said she had tracked Humphreys down through . Facebook in 2010 and she - together with her twin sister - went to live . with him. He . said that officials became suspicious when the pair were observed . acting in a manner which was not just 'over familiar' but in an 'overtly . sexualised manner'. 'Their relationship was overt and sexual and were involved with each other in a full physical relationship,' he added. Mr Brennand said that others started to notice that the pair were not acting in a normal manner. He said: 'Friends and family have also observed these two defendants interact with one another. The court heard that the pair had been estranged for a number of years since Jackson was put up for adoption when she was just 17-months-old . Judge Paul Batty QC said it was a 'terrible case' considering the age difference, her vulnerability and Humphrey's previous conviction for underage sex . 'Once . again there are small pieces of evidence suggestive of the fact that . Humphreys was behaving in a sexualised manner towards his daughter.' He said . that both defendants had both strongly denied being in a sexual . relationship and when first questioned Jackson had exercised her right . to make 'no comment' to answers during interview. However, the pair both changed their pleas to guilty at Carlisle Crown Court in February this year. David Birrell, defending Humphreys, said there was 'very little mitigation' he could put before the court. The court heard that Humphreys had a previous conviction for having sex with a 15-year-old girl when he was 28 years old. Humphreys, of Cleator Moor, Cumbria, was jailed at Carlisle Crown Court (pictured) for 21 months. Jackson was given a two-year community order, where she will be supervised by members of the probation service, as well as a five-month curfew . Greg Hoare, defending Jackson, said she had been looking for some permanence when she decided to trace her biological father. He added that the case had affected her and she had been shunned and even threatened by others as a result. Judge Paul Batty QC said it was a 'terrible case' considering the age difference, her vulnerability and Humphrey's previous conviction for underage sex. He said: 'You took them under your roof and there were serious concerns in relation to your activity.' As well as the prison sentence, Humphreys will be made the subject of a sex offenders prevention order. Under the terms of the order he will be prevented from having any contact with any child, or family member, under the age of 16 without permission. Jackson was given a two-year community order, where she will be supervised by members of the probation service, as well as a five-month curfew between 9pm and 6am. She will also be on the sex offenders register for five years. Genetic sexual attraction is a seldom-talked about phenomenon that frequently occurs between adoptees and their long-lost parents. It describes feelings of intense intimacy between two relatives who have been separated during the critical years of development and bonding, and then meet for the first time as adults. Essentially strangers, when an adult-child and their biological parent finally meet, the brain struggles to associate each other as family. Instead, they become captivated with one another, sharing similar physical features, likes and dislikes, which is coupled with complex feelings of intimacy. This can lead both parties to express their emotions sexually. The phenomenon was first identified by Barbara Gonyo in the Eighties, after she a wrote book called I'm His Mother, But He's Not My Son, which recounted her personal story of reuniting with the son she placed for adoption at 16. A sexual relationship with her son ensued, and Ms Gonyo says she fell in love - a byproduct of delayed bonding that normally takes place in infancy between new parents and their child, according to psychologists. Researchers believe that when family members grow up in close proximity, a inherent taboo is created through reverse sexual imprinting, which desensitises them to later sexual attraction. Called the Westermarck effect, researchers hypothesize it evolved so biological relatives would not inbreed.","Eleanor Jackson, 23, was taken from her biological father Frank Humphreys, 51, when she was just 17 months old .

"By . Jeff Powell . Follow @@jeffpowell_Mail . Manny Pacquiao’s return journey to Las Vegas has taken him via Jimmy Kimmel’s chat show on American television, where he was joined on camera by Bill Clinton. The former US president not only expressed his unbounded admiration of the PacMan as a boxer but endorsed him as a future leader of the Philippines. The man standing in the way of the first of those ambitions sees that celebrity shoulder-rubbing as further reason why he will beat the legendary Pacquiao for a second time in the MGM Grand Garden. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Pacquiao train and arrive in Las Vegas ahead of bout . All smiles: Manny Pacquiao appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live, making quite an impression on former president Bill Clinton . Back in the limelight: The old master Clinton shares a gag with chat-show host Kimmel . Tim Bradley, the defending WBO welterweight champion, says: ‘Manny is not as hungry as he used to be. He’s lost the fire.’ Bradley would be unwise to rely too much on his suspicion that Pacquiao has gone into decline since he was awarded a quite scandalous points victory over him in their first fight. Or that the PacMan’s political duties as a senator and champion of the poor in his country are such a distraction that he has lost a vital measure of his interest in proving himself one of the greatest fighters of his generation. Pacquiao, although respectful of Bradley, remains deeply aggravated by the blinkered Nevadan judges who consigned him to the first of two defeats which jeopardised his ring career. Fully focused? Tim Bradley has accused Pacquiao of taking his mind off the game . Defending champion: Bradley can inflict the third defeat of Pacquiao's glittering career on Saturday night . In a way, the spectacular knockout loss which followed was fuelled by the need he felt to look impressive in his fourth battle with Juan Manuel Marquez. Sensing he was about to stop his bitter Mexican rival, Pacquiao stayed in range too long and was caught by desperate punch. Bradley also draws encouragement from Pacquiao, in his comeback fight from that upset, failing to apply the knockout to Brandon Rios despite comprehensively out-classing him over 12 rounds. Pacquiao had shown signs of showing sympathy and easing up against inferior opponents previously, Bradley among them. But now his master-trainer Freddie Roach has spent months instilling in him the need to go for the kill when he has a man in trouble... not least to avoid leaving himself at the mercy of incompetent or prejudiced judges. ‘I want Manny to go for the KO against Bradley,’ says Roach. ‘And I expect him to get it.’ Masters at work: Trainer Freddie Roach says Pacquiao will KO his American opponent in Sin City . Grudge match: Bradley celebrates with the welterweight belt after beating the Filipino almost two years ago . If he’s right, it would make the powerful statement which even Floyd Mayweather would find hard to ignore. Bradley is unbeaten in 33 fights. In the most recent of those, last October, he cleverly and clearly out-pointed Marquez, and he has certainly developed as a boxer since that first meeting with Pacquiao two years ago. However, Pacquiao has much to prove – and even more money than usual to look forward to if he can arouse the public to harass Mayweather into meeting him in what would-be the richest fight in ring history. I have no idea how much Mr Clinton knows about boxing but as a genius at political survival he can certainly recognise the qualities of a committed professional in-fighter when he sees one. Bradley acknowledges that the scoring controversy which blighted their first fight has hurt public perception of him and he, too, is eager reconfirm his reputation as a formidable boxer in his own right. But when he warns ‘this fight will not go the distance’ he may find Pacquiao only too willing to endorse that prediction... albeit not in the way he means it. Carl Frampton fully deserves to be viewed as the heir apparent to his own mentor, the great Barry McGuigan, in the firmament of Northern Irish boxing. The super-bantamweight from the Tiger’s Bay area of Belfast is bringing back to Ulster the roaring atmosphere which pervaded McGuigan’s own ascent to world championship glory. By intimidating Hugo Cazares into defeat at the weekend, Frampton laid mandatory claim to a first world title shot of his own and promoter McGuigan hopes to tempt the WBC champion to Belfast later this year, possibly for a stadium fight. Home comforts: Carl Frampton (right) was in scintillating form, beating Mexican Hugo Cazares inside two rounds in his native Belfast . Mentor: The great Barry McGuigan cheers his protege's victory in front of a partisan crowd . Even as that prospect opened up temptation appeared in the shape of Guillermo Rigondeaux, who promptly volunteered to bring his WBA, WBO and Ring Magazine belts across the Atlantic.Careful, Carl and Barry. Rigondeaux, as a two-time Olympic gold medallist, was one of the greatest amateur boxers of all time. Since defecting from Cuba he has won his first world title on only his ninth professional outing and gone on to totally outclass and bewilder Nonito Donaire, the Filipino touted as the next Manny Pacquiao, in a unification bout. Pacquaio’s own Hall of Fame trainer, Freddie Roach, describes Rigondeaux as ‘probably the greatest talent I’ve ever seen.’ Future opponent: The dangerous Guillermo Rigondeaux awaits somewhere on the horizon for Frampton . In terms of punching accuracy, mastery of the noble art of self-defence and pure skill it is hard to argue, even though American audiences have not yet taken to his elusive style. So Frampton and McGuigan need to stick with Plan A, hopefully overcome Santa Cruz wherever that happens and develop towards a Rigondeaux fight as the Cuban, now 33, ages a little and his phenomenal reflexes slow a fraction. At the moment, Rigondeaux is a man you can’t hit. Santa Cruz is a fight Frampton can win. As Enzo Maccarinelli’s right eye closed – and his vision of becoming a two-weight world champion disappeared from his sight – some of boxing’s old-stagers took to wondering why his corner did not apply a rather gruesome remedy of the past to the swelling. Maccarinelli was wounded by a clash of heads in the first round of his challenge for Juergen Braehmer’s WBA light-heavyweight title in Rostock, Germany. The swelling around the eye ballooned up as he took a couple of left hooks to the damaged area from Braehmer, who himself had suffered a cut eye in the collision. Warrior: Enzo Maccarinelli battled on for four rounds with this nasty eye injury . A sorry sight: Maccarinelli's title dreams were ended as his cornerman threw in the towel . Maccarinelli gamely fought on but as he took increasing punishment from punches he could not see, trainer Gary Lockett pulled him out at the end of the fifth. In years gone by fabled American corner-men – Muhammad Ali’s trainer Angelo Dundee prominent among them – would have bled out the pus by taking a razor-blade to slit the engorged area. Old master: Angelo Dundee (right) attends to Muhammad Ali (then Cassius Clay) during his 1966 victory against Karl Mildenberger . Since the worst of the swelling was below the eye, that primitive option was open to Team Enzo.Maccarinelli is a brave man who no doubt would have agreed had they put it to him. Instead, still only 33 but with several heavy KOs among his seven defeats, he is left to ponder whether this particular retirement should become permanent.","Manny Pacquiao appeared on the Jimmy Kimmel Show with Bill Clinton, giving Tim Bradley more belief that the former champ has lost his fire .

"By . Paul Collins . The teenage son of a sex-worker who grew up in the slums of one of India’s largest cities has been chosen to train with Manchester United. Rajib Roy, who shares a single room with his mother and brother in the red light district of Kolkata, West Bengal, is set to play football at Old Trafford after being spotted by talent scouts. The 16-year-old is one of 11 teens arriving in the UK this weekend to spend two weeks training with Manchester United’s coaches. Dazzling dribbler: Rajib Roy, 16, from Kolkata, West Bengal, is set to arrive in Manchester this weekend to take part in a training camp at Old Trafford after being spotted by talent scouts . Rajib is pictured with his few possessions in the family's single-room home in the Kolkata slum, the largest red light district in Asia, where he grew up with his prostitute mother and younger brother . Family support: Rajib's mother Rekha, an impoverished sex worker, helped him along his way to football success by sending him to a local school for children of women in her profession . The . talented teenager caught the eye of United talent scouts at a national tournament for India's best young players. Most . of the other boys travelling to Manchester this weekend are from . well-off families and have the advantage of good schooling and fluency . in English. Rajib on the other hand, has . grown up playing barefoot in the squalid streets of Kolkata where he . lives in the heart of the largest red light area in Asia. The Sonagachi suburb is home to 12,000 sex workers and he shares a tiny single room with his mother Rekha and younger brother. Their . cramped apartment also has a poster of Chelsea's Oscar who Rajeeb . idolises because, like him, he comes from a background of poverty in Brazil. Like most boys in his neighbourhood Rajib has no idea who his father is, and he describes the moment he heard Manchester United had picked him as ‘like a father's recognition.’ Humble beginnings: Rajib is pictured with his mother Rekha in the small single room they share in Sonagachi, the suburb known as Kolkata's red light district, which is home to 12,000 sex workers and their families . Rajib, who has no idea who his father is, stands in the doorway of his home in the Sonagachi suburb of Kolkata, formerly known as Calcutta, in West Bengal . Change of scenery: The talented striker learned to play football on these streets in the West Bengal slum he calls home, but is set to swap them for Old Trafford this weekend . Many . of his friends have fallen prey to drugs and petty crime but Rajib has . some prospects thanks to his natural footballing abilities. His life changed two years ago when his mother sent him to the local Rahul Vidya Niketan school for the children of prostitutes. It was set up by the Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee whose aim is to improve the lives of sex workers and their families. Four . years ago DMSC founder Dr Samarjit Jana set up a foorball initiative at . the school, believing that sport was the best way to integrate them into . mainstream society. Earlier this year striker Rajib was part of the West Bengal team to win the National Slum Soccer Tournament in Nagpur. Last month he and 30 others from the DMSC were selected to take part in a nationwide school football championship in Goa. Coaches from Manchester United were watching and they chose 11 boys who will fly to Britain and Old Trafford on Sunday. Close to goal: The 16-year-old is one of 11 teens arriving in the UK this weekend to spend two weeks training with Manchester United's coaches after being spotted at a national tournament for young players in India . Football for life: Rajib, centre, is pictured with his friends in the Kolkata slum where they grew up . High hopes: Although he dreams of playing Premiere League football for Manchester United, Rajib hopes that his football talents will help him earn money to put his younger brother in a  good school . Among . other things they will get a free tour of the world-famous stadium . which normally costs £20 - the monthly income of Rajib's family. Rajib said: ‘People keep asking me how it feels to be my mother's son and then achieve something like this. ‘I don't know how to answer that question. ‘But when my coach told me I had been selected by Manchester United it was like a father's recognition.’ He . added: ‘My mother is a very shy person. She would lock me in my room . after lunch so that I could take a nap, but I would quietly sneak out to . play with my friends. ‘Last . month I was selected along with 30 others to participate in a camp in . Goa through a nationwide school championship competition. ‘I arrived late because I took a train from Kolkata. Everybody else took a flight. Rajib has been attending the local Rahul Vidya Niketan school for the children of prostitutes, pictured, for two years, which is how he was finally able to play organised football . The founder of the Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee, whose aim is to improve the lives of sex workers and their families, Dr Samarjit Jana set up the football initiative which helped Rajib win a place at the Manchester United training camp . The . teen admits he often spent the little money his mother gives him to buy . lunch on watching football tournaments elsewhere in the city. Dr. Jana said: ‘Rajib's dream is to build career in football. He wants to . play in the English Premier league and his favorite team is Manchester . United. ‘One of his other . goals is to help his nine year-old brother get into an English medium . school so he can develop a better academic career.’ Dr. Jana added: ‘We started a football academy on a very small scale four years ago. ‘It provides training for children of marginalised communities such as sex workers and construction workers. ‘Out of 11 boys selected from this eastern part of India by Manchester United two of them are from our community. ‘There are five million sex workers in India and we are just providing a minority of them, and their families, with a chance. ‘This shows that if you give them the opportunities they have a chance of success and I'm sure other boys will follow them.’","Rajib Roy, 16, lives in the red light district of Kolkata, West Bengal .

"By . Mark Prigg . The Parker app will automatically shows users in Manchester where their nearest free spot is. 200 sensors are to be installed in parking bays in the first UK trial of the technology . Smart parking spaces that can automatically alert drivers when they become free are set to be trialled in the UK for the first time. Manchester City Council is testing the new technology, used in American cities, with electronic sensors placed in 200 parking bays. For six months the system will be free to use and will not cost the council a penny either as a trial. Experts behind the scheme said the app is voice controlled, so it can be used at the wheel, and it also works as a sat nav, directing motorists to the nearest available space. In what will be the first major trial for a UK city, motorists will be able to download a mobile phone app which will enable them to see in real time which bays are available, reducing the need for people to drive around looking for spaces. The free Parker app, available for iPhones and Android devices, can also act as a sat nav directing motorists to the nearest available bay and is voice-activated so can be used while driving. The app, which recently won an innovation award at an international award ceremony in Barcelona, will also be linked to the City Council's existing pay by phone system. It will also enable parking bosses to see detailed information about which bays are being used at what times, and for how long. The City Council, along with its contractor NSL, is working with US-based company Streetline to trial the new system, which is currently being used successfully in cities such as Los Angeles, Washington DC and New York. The company is providing the equipment free of charged for the six-month trial set to start in March. The sensors are being placed in 200 bays but if the trial is successful, the system could be extended to other parts of the city centre. Councillor Nigel Murphy, Manchester City Council's executive member for the environment, said: 'This technology has proved very successful in US cities, where it has been welcomed by both businesses and motorists who say it has made finding parking spaces much easier and reduced the need for people to drive around looking for available bays. Scroll down for demo video . The new app will help motorists find a nearby free parking space . 'I believe motorists coming into Manchester to shop, eat in restaurants or go to the theatre will find it just as useful. 'Manchester was the birthplace of the computer and continues to be a dynamic place keen to take on technical innovations, and so it is entirely fitting that we should be the first British city to properly test this new system.' Nigel Coltman, local government . director from NSL, said: 'We're really pleased that Manchester, as the . original modern city centre, has chosen to trial Parker. 'With . 30 per cent of drivers looking for a parking space at any one time, . we're confident that it will significantly reduce carbon emissions, . resulting in a more pleasant and less fraught environment for all.' One of the smart sensors being used in the trial . Small sensors with wireless capabilities are placed in each parking spot - in Manchester, 200 will be installed. Each sensor can tell a control centre if a car is parked in it. App users can simply load the app and be automatically directed to their nearest free space. They can also reserve a space, and see how much each one costs. In Manchester, the sensors will be placed in bays on the following streets: King Street, George Street, Faulkner Street, Charlotte Street, Nicholas Street, Princess Street, Tib Street, Thomas Street, Turner Street, Spear Street, Hilton Street, Stevenson Square and Newton Street. the system is already in use is several US cities, including San Francisco and in Venice Beach.","Sensors will be installed in 200 Manchester parking spaces in first UK trial of the technology .

"By . Laura Clark . One in six universities – including top institutions such as Oxford – have been awarding too many good degrees, a groundbreaking study has claimed. In the first analysis of its kind, researchers looked at the ‘academic profile’ of students who graduated in 2011. The statistics, which included exam results from school, were then used to predict what degree results the students were likely to achieve. Experts believe that some institutions are 'over-rewarding' top grades . They discovered that out of the 123 English universities that were examined, 21 awarded significantly more firsts and 2:1s than expected. The list included several members of the elite Russell Group including Oxford, Liverpool, Newcastle, Warwick and Exeter. The universities insist their high rates of top degrees were down to good teaching. But the study, which was carried out by the Higher Education Funding Council, has cast renewed doubt on the value of degree grades, which are controlled by universities with little outside scrutiny. External examiners – academics from other institutions – check how exams are marked but generally only ensure a consistent standard for a pass mark, rather than a first or 2:1. The figures led to warnings that university league tables are encouraging academics to mark exams leniently. Institutions such as Brunel University in Uxbridge, West London (pictured) are named on the list . Experts said the research pointed to ‘over-awarding’ by some universities which was contributing to grade inflation. Professor Alan Smithers, of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, said: ‘The results add statistical clout to the widely held view that some universities award more firsts and upper seconds than is  justified by their intakes. One of the drivers is the natural wish of universities to score well in league tables. ‘The percentage of firsts and upper seconds they choose to award actually contributes significantly to those tables so there is quite an incentive to award good degrees. ‘Almost certainly there has been inflation in degree classes. Firsts and upper seconds have gone up too rapidly for it to be genuine improvement.’ Experts believe that university rankings should not use results as this encourages in grade inflation . And he called for the tables to stop allowing degree grades to influence rankings, saying: ‘The biggest single contribution to allowing these difficult judgments to emerge dispassionately would be to remove that perverse incentive.’ Professor Smithers also pointed to strong regional patterns. He said that if a university saw an ‘institution down the road giving out a lot more good degrees than they are, they may think they are being too hard on their students. It suggests the standard that is set is subjective.’ The survey also showed that 18 institutions – including Imperial College London and King’s College – awarded significantly fewer good degrees than expected. However Exeter, which in 2011 handed out one of the highest proportions of firsts and 2:1s out of any university in England, awarded the top two grades to 82.8 per cent of students. A spokesman said its ‘focus on excellent teaching is borne out in our degree results’.Cambridge gave the top two degrees to 87.4 per cent of students and Oxford awarded the grades to 90.9 per cent of students in 2011 – more than any other university. An Oxford University spokesman said: ‘At Oxford, we offer a high level of individual teaching. ‘We are confident that this approach, combined with rigorous examination processes, ensures that final degree classifications accurately reflect the very high abilities of our students.’","More than 10 percent of colleges are awarding more 2:1 degrees than expected .

"By . Associated Press . and Jonathan Block . Miss America has suggested officials at a Pennsylvania high school reconsider their decision to suspend a student for approaching her at a school assembly and asking her to be his prom date, the beauty queen said on Saturday. The disciplinary action taken by school administrators in York against the 18-year-old senior made national headlines, and generated sympathy for the young man on social media. 'I was flattered by the gesture although I am unfortunately . unable to attend due to my travel schedule. I later learned of the . disciplinary action taken and reached out to the school in hopes that . they will reconsider their decision,' she wrote. Scroll down for video . Miss America said she was flattered by the gesture but just didn't have time in her schedule to make it to the prom . Miss America, Nina Davuluri, was at a high school in York, Pennsylvania when she got asked to the prom by a senior, who was then suspended for  three days for asking her the question . 'Meeting and interacting with students across the country has . been an important and rewarding part of my year as Miss America,' she added. 'I . always encourage students to follow their dreams through education, and . I'm inspired daily by the enthusiasm and aspirations of the bright young . adults I have the pleasure of meeting through my travels.' A . video of Central York High School senior Patrick Farves approaching . 2014 Miss America Nina Davuluri on Thursday at a school assembly was . posted on a local newspaper's website. It shows . Farves walking up to Davuluri bearing a plastic flower and ask her to . his prom, as the crowd of students erupts in laughter and cheers. Farves said he didn't consider his proposal rejected since he never got a direct answer . Administrators . had heard rumors Farves was planning to make the bold gesture of . approaching Davuluri and warned him not to do so, Farves said in a phone . interview on Saturday. 'By that time, my mind was already set,' he said. 'I was already in the zone.' Farves . was given a three-day in-school suspension, which requires him to sit . in a classroom and work alone. He said he now feels bad his stunt . overshadowed efforts by Davuluri - the first-ever Indian-American Miss . America pageant winner - to promote diversity. 'She . was trying to get across a very strong message - about how it's not . about your beliefs or the color of your skin, but who you are,' he said. Although he was warned not to by a staff member, Patrick Farves, 18, asked Miss America out to the prom during an appearance she made at the school, earning Farves a three-day suspension. Farves, . who said his mother is white and his father is black, also said he . regretted his action because school officials worked hard to organize . the event. While . he has scores of new Twitter followers and Facebook friend requests, . Farves said he remains without a date for his school's May 10 prom. School officials issued a statement on Central York High's Facebook page, defending the decision to suspend Farves. 'It . is not our practice to discipline a student for asking someone - even . Miss America - to a school dance,' the statement said. 'However, it is . our practice to set expectations for student behavior, to communicate . those expectations and rules to students and families and to ensure . those rules are followed within our schools.' A . school spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment . on Davuluri's statement. The high school senior student was . suspended Thursday when he asked Miss America, Nina Davuluri, out to the . prom when she made an appearance at the school. Davuluri . was at Central York High School in York, just south of the state . capital, Harrisburg, Thursday when Patrick Farves, 18, asked Miss . America to prom during a question and answer session. 'At that point in time, it was 10 minutes before the presentation, and I was pretty much set to do it,' he said. 'I was a little pressured. Everybody expected me to do it. I'm the kind of person who, if someone says I won't do something, I'll prove people wrong. I will.' Video Source YouTube . Nina Davuluri, representing New York, reacts after being crowned Miss America on September 15, 2013 in Atlantic City, New Jersey . The school, facing criticism from some who thought the administration went to far, responded on Friday afternoon. 'It is not our practice to discipline a student for asking someone â€” even Miss America â€” to a school dance,' the statement from the Central York School District reads in part. 'However, it is our practice to set expectations for student behavior, to communicate those expectations and rules to students and families and to ensure those rules are followed within our schools. This practice is not uncommon and happens every day, multiple times a day, in schools, businesses and homes across America.' The school district also took offense to the media's reporting of the incident, saying, 'it's as shame that the media wants to frame this story to sell papers and make headlines using a distortion of what actually occurred.' Many students, however, think the administration overreacted, and took to social media to express their feeling, using the hashtag #freepatty on Twitter. 'True diversity is when you don't punish someone for being a little bit different"" @CYStudentUnion tweeted.","Nina Davuluri was at Central York High School in Pennsylvania as part of a diversity event .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A young Massachusetts couple were killed in a car crash Wednesday morning on their way pick up relatives who were making a surprise visit. William Barnett, 20, and Alyssa Grenier, 18, were on their way to Logan International Airport to pick up Grenier's aunt and uncle when, as authorities would later piece together from accident reconstruction and witness accounts, Barnett hit a patch of ice, lost control of the van, and struck a guardrail. The van was then struck by a tractor trailer as it swerved back into traffic. William Barnett and Alyssa Grenier were killed in a car accident as the couple drove to Logan International Airport to pick up Grenier's aunt and uncle, who were flying in for Grenier's birthday . Grenier would have been 19 on Thursday. Grenier's aunt and uncle were coming to wish her a happy birthday. 'They were flying out to surprise her, but Billy . couldn't keep a secret and he ended up telling her. She was so excited . they were coming,' Barnett's mother, Marlene Barnett, told the Courant. When the couple failed to arrive at the airport and didn't answer their phones, Marlene drove to Boston on the chance they were broken down on the side of the road. As Marlene searched, Barnett's sister looked for news about crashes and called the Massachusetts State Police asking about an accident in Framingham she'd read about. Barnett started work with Tradesmen of New England in Bloomfield in 2013 . Troopers then requested Barnett go to the nearest barracks. William Barnett grew up in Stafford, graduating from high school there in 2012. He went on to Lincoln Technical School in East Windsor to study heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning. After graduating second in his class, he was hired by the Tradesmen of New England in Bloomfield in 2013.

"By . Damien Gayle . and Mark Prigg . Over ten million iPhone owners downloaded Google's maps app in 48 hours, the search giant has revealed. The app is expected to replace Apple's own mapping software on the majority of iPhones - although Apple does not let users delete its app. 'More than 10 million downloads in less than 48 hours after release!' said Google's Jeff Huber, announcing the milestone online. Scroll down for video . On the app store: Google has finally released a version of its Maps app for the iPhone 5, after Apple's own equivalent was roundly criticised for its errors . The free app shot to the top of Apple's download chart within hours of its release, and is still there. 'We're excited for the positive reception of Google Maps for iPhone around the world.' The . iPhone's default maps app was previously powered by Google until Apple . took over with its own software in early September and blocked users . from using Google's app. But . the gadget maker was bombarded with complaints for its app's errors and . forced into a humiliating apology to customers that led to the sacking . of the man in charge of its development. However, the firm does not let users delete the Apple maps software. Lost: In one particularly bad error, Australian police warned Apple Maps could kill after it directed users looking for a city to this barren stretch of outback . The app was even blasted by Australian police as 'potentially life threatening' after it sent users off course in the outback. Today Google thanked its team for the work to create its own app. 'Congratulations to the Maps Team on . the recognition for the passion and hard work they poured into it, for . this release and over the last 7+ years,' said Huber. The Google Maps app includes . public transport directions and traffic information, for which they are . famous, as well as rotating 2D and 3D views and street view. Daniel Graf, director of Google Maps for Mobile, wrote on the company's official blog: 'The app shows more map on screen and turns mobile mapping into one intuitive experience. 'It . is designed from the ground up to combine the comprehensiveness and . accuracy of Google Maps with an interface that makes finding what you're . looking for faster and easier.' Last weej police in Australia warned drivers with iPhones not to navigate with Apple Maps after users looking for one city found themselves in barren outback more than 40 miles away. Motorists following the much-criticised mapping service to the city of Mildura in the country's south-east ended up in the middle of the nearby Murray-Sunset National Park. With no nearby water supplies and temperatures in the park reaching as high as 46C, police warned the mapping error had the potential to be 'life-threatening'. Apple launched the maps service in September after dumping Google's maps in the latest version of its iPhone and iPad software. Instead, it decided to create its own, using partners such as TomTom for data, while also using helicopters and planes to create 3D maps of major cities. However, when the app was released, users discovered thousands of flaws. This led to outrage among users who flooded Twitter and Facebook with examples of Apple's flawed maps. Apple’s shares may plunge another 20 per cent as the company slides towards a ‘Death Cross’, analysts have claimed. Investors in the tech giant - the most valuable company in the world - have been ‘panic selling’ and brought the price down from its high of $705 a share in September to its current price of $547. Now there are fears that it could slump to $420 or lower amid fears Apple has run out of ideas. Analysts said that the company must avoid what is known as a ‘Death Cross’ where both long and short term prospects look grim. That will happen when a stock’s 50 day moving average goes below its 200 day moving average - a very real possibility with Apple. The California-based company has been rocked in recent weeks by reports revealing the strength of the competition from Google and Samsung. Errors noticed by users and tech reviewers included major towns such as Stratford-upon-Avon appearing to be missing, searches for Manchester United Football Club bringing up Sale United - a football club for the over-fives, and large parts of the world obscured by cloud in satellite views. The product's shoddiness prompted Apple CEO Tim Cook to replace Scott Forstall, the executive in charge of Apple's mobile operating system, and Richard Williamson, the executive who had overseen the mapping team. He was even forced into issuing and humiliating apology and recommending that iPhone owners consider using Google maps through a mobile Web browser or seek other alternatives until his company could fix the problems. Google engineers started working on their new maps app before Apple's September 19 decision to evict them from iOS, Google's Mr Graf said, though he declined to be more specific. The additional tools in Google's free iPhone mapping app include turn-by-turn directions. These have long been included on Android versions of the software and Google's previous refusal to include it on the iPhone is believed to be one of the reasons Apple decided to develop its own technology. The friction that has developed between Google and Apple as they jostle for leadership in the increasingly important smartphone market also played a role in the mapping switch. Google's new iPhone mapping app also . will offer its street-level photography of local neighbourhoods for the . first time on Apple's mobile operating system, as well as . three-dimensional views, public transit directions and listings for more . than 80million businesses. The . iPhone app still lacks some of the mapping features available on . Android-powered phones, such as directions in malls and other buildings. A difficult road ahead: Apple's maps were . slammed for their poor location information and distorted images, . forcing the company into issuing an apology and fire two executives deemed responsible for the mess up . There still isn't a Google mapping app for Apple's top-selling tablet computer, the iPad, but the company plans to make one eventually. In the meantime, iPad users can access see the maps in an iPhone mode. Google's free mapping solution is likely to become one of the hottest commodities in Apple's app store, if for no other reason because of pent-up demand among iPhone owners fed up with Apple's alternative. Some iPhone owners even refused to upgrade to Apple's newest software, iOS 6, because they didn't want to lose access to the old Google mapping application built into iOS 5 and earlier versions.","Apple dumped Google from its latest software in September .

Colleagues this afternoon paid tribute to their fellow officer. 'You worry about him getting hurt . fighting a fire, and I always worry about that with my guys, but this is . something you don't expect,' said Brownwood fire chief Del Albright. 'Whatever the family wants, we'll . make it happen,' he told ESPN. 'We have traditions and ways of . remembering our fallen brothers and sisters with honour guards and flag . ceremonies. We'll talk with the family and see what we need to do.' Mr Albright said that Mr Stone was 'dependable' and have been honoured with a distinguished service medal.

The former president was sitting in the front row when the tragedy happened . It is the second fatal fall at a major league stadium this season. In May, a 27-year-old man died after he fell about 20 feet and struck his head on concrete during a Colorado Rockies game. Witnesses told police that the man had been trying to slide down a staircase railing at Coors Field and lost his balance during a game against Arizona . Between innings, Rangers manager Ron Washington spoke briefly with one of the umpires. He said: 'We knew about it, we didn't know exactly what happened. It's sad, it's very sad. Oakland reliever Brad Ziegler was in the visitor's bullpen in left-center field close to the area where the man fell. Ziegler was in tears after the game when he found out about the death. The pitcher said when the man was put on a stretcher, he told people tending to him that his son was 'up there by himself' and asked them to check on the boy. He said: 'He had his arms swinging. He talked and was conscious. We assumed he was OK. 'But when you find out he's not, it's just tough.' Bob Melvin, manager of visiting side the Oakland As said: 'It's just devastating. I don't even know what to say. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family. 'It filtered into our dugout. ... I made a little announcement to the team after the game. Certainly baseball is not very important in light of something like that.'

"By . Emma Clark . It looks like something from another era - and in many ways it is. But this overgrown telephone box, covered both inside and out by ivy, is still fully functioning in Street, Somerset. However, BT are set to decommission the telephone box because it has only been used four times in the last year. It is not known whether its lack of use is down to the increasing popularity of mobile phones... or whether people aren't even able to see it's there! Ring ring the changes: The public can just about gain access to the telephone box but it will soon be out of use . Hidden from view: Despite its shabby state, the telephone is actually in full working order . It has become so overgrown with trees, . shrubs and ivy from a nearby hedge that it is hard to tell it is there . at all in a sign of our times when more people than ever are using . mobile phones. By March this year, Ofcom said 92 per cent of the UK's adult population had a mobile phone - more than 46 million people. In 2006 it was pictured in a similar state and now six years later it will be decommissioned because it underused, somewhat unsurprisingly. A  BT spokesman said: ‘This is a little used payphone, which is due to be removed in the next few months. ‘Only four calls have been made from this payphone in the past year. It's for Yew: Both the inside and the outside of the neglected telephone box has been overcome by plantlife . How it should look: This telephone box on the island of Housay, in the Shetland Islands, has been well looked after despite it remote location . ‘There have been no complaints from the public but we will of course tidy up the kiosk now we are aware of the problem.’ The . iconic red telephone boxes were once a familiar sight on the streets of . the United Kingdom, painted red to make them easily identifiable to the . public. Despite a reduction in their numbers in recent years, red boxes can still be seen in many places and in current or former British colonies around the world. Some kiosks have even been sold off and converted to be used as shower cubicles in private homes. In Kingston upon Thames a number of old K6 boxes have been utilised to form a work of art resembling a row of fallen dominoes. In 2009 a K6 in the village of Westbury-sub-Mendip in Somerset was converted into a library or book exchange replacing the services of the mobile library which no longer visits the village.","Phone in Street, Somerset, has only been used four times in the last year .

"By . Claire Ellicott . A baby was killed by a falling lamppost days after a construction worker inadvertently cut through its foundations. Engineer Kelvin Elmore – a father himself – said he wished he could ‘take the child’s place’ after learning of his role in the death of Tommy Hollis. The little boy suffered fatal head injuries shortly before his first birthday when the metal pole toppled and struck him while he slept in his pushchair. Tragic: Tommy Hollis died a day before his first birthday after a workman mistook the post for a tramline and cut it outside London's Chiswick Town Hall in February 2010 . Happy family: Tommy laughs for a photo shoot with his mother, Kate, and . father, Chris. They attended the hearing, although Mrs Hollis left the . courtroom when details of her son's injuries were read out. His parents have called for ‘answers’ over the tragedy, adding: ‘We don’t want any other family to go through what we’ve gone through.’ Yesterday, an inquest at West London Coroner’s Court heard that Mr Elmore had cut through the lamppost’s steel foundation during a project to widen the road. He told the court: ‘As a father myself,  I cannot express how horrified I am to have had any involvement with the death of a child. If I could take the place of that child, I would.’ Mr Elmore was part of a team moving cables in the ground outside Chiswick town hall in West London on February 18, 2010. He was attempting to clear obstacles when he came across a section of steel and presumed it to be an old tram line. He tried to cut through the metal with a steel cutter but found it was attached to concrete and decided to leave it. It later emerged that it was part of the foundations for the lamppost, which stood 18in from where he tried to cut the steel. Probe: Civil Engineer Kelvin Elmore (left), who cut the post, said he wished he had died instead of Tommy. Right, workmen inspect the lamppost on the day it fell . He said: ‘I had believed the piece of steel to be part of a tram line and had no idea it was connected to the lamppost. ‘Had I known that, I would not have continued to work in the vicinity of the lamppost myself.’ Five days later, on February 23, the lamppost fell, fatally injuring Tommy and hitting 62-year-old grandmother Mary Gregory in the lower back. A pathologist recorded the cause of the baby’s death as ‘severe impact head injury’. Mr Elmore told the inquest that in 17 years in his job, he had never seen a lamppost with such unusual foundations. He also said that the council had already dug up the road and had not informed him that the lamppost had a piece of steel welded on to it. He added: ‘I was surprised and shocked at how the lamppost had been modified to anchor it to the ground.’ He also said that he had ‘no idea’ his actions had made the lamppost unstable. Mr Elmore was found guilty of gross misconduct by employers McNicholas and given a written warning, but was allowed to continue working for the company. Yesterday, Tommy’s mother Kate, 40, a senior legal counsel at finance firm GE Capital, and her husband Christopher, 42, a pilot, said they still wanted ‘answers’. Helping others: Mr and Mrs Hollis had another son, Jack, in September. They have set up a charity in Tommy's name to 'give loving care to children, in particular those without parents' Mrs Hollis added: ‘We still find it incredibly difficult to believe it happened. We waited a long time to have Tommy. He was extra special. He was just a happy, smiley boy who spread joy wherever he went. The reality is it could have been any child.’ The couple, whose have an eight-month-old son called Jack, have set up a charity in Tommy’s memory to raise money for a number of children’s causes. Tommy’s nanny Anna Martin told the inquest how she tried to resuscitate him after the lamppost fell. She said he was asleep in his pushchair as they strolled from his parents’ house in Chiswick towards a branch of Starbucks for a coffee. In a statement, she added: ‘I took one hand off the pushchair handles to check the traffic lights. ‘The next thing I remember was  a loud noise which sounded  like something hollow hitting  something.’ She said she pulled  the pushchair back instinctively and realised that Tommy was not moving. Tragedy: Nanny Mary Gregory lies behind Tommy's buggy in Chiswick, West London . A police officer removes the pram from the scene: Anna Martin said she was wheeling the sleeping toddler past roadworks when she heard a 'hollow' noise followed by a 'terrible scream' Respect: A couple look at flowers laid at the scene. Nanny Miss Martin tried to revive the little boy with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation but he never regained consciousness . She added: ‘I took him out of his pushchair and saw a long piece of metal that looked like a pipe. ‘I didn’t know what was wrong, but his eyes were closed and he looked like he was sleeping, which worried me. I shouted for help.’ She tried to resuscitate him but he had fallen into an ‘instantaneous coma’ and was airlifted to the Royal London Hospital, where he died two days later. She said she was always ‘really careful’ around the area because it ‘wasn’t safe’ with all the workmen. Dominic Long, an inspector for the Health and Safety Executive, said that up to 10 per cent of lampposts had ‘hybrid column’ foundations like the one Mr Elmore cut through. Another expert told the inquest that Mr Elmore should have realised the steel was connected to the lamppost. Asked whether there was any indication that the two were joined, engineer Clive Lane said: ‘Only its closeness. I think one hopes you would trace the steel back to see where it goes.’ The inquest continues.

"By . Martin Beckford . Victim: James Bulger, two, was murdered in 1993 . Young children suspected of crimes could be spared trial under controversial plans raised by  a leading official. Lord McNally, the new head of the youth justice quango, is the most senior serving figure to suggest the Government should look at raising the  age of criminal responsibility from ten to 12. In his first interview since taking up the post in March, he also said Ministers should consider replacing traditional youth courts with informal panels similar to those in Scotland. The Liberal Democrat peer, a justice minister until last year, claimed the main obstacle to the sweeping change was the fear of politicians that the media would say it meant the two ten-year-old boys who abducted and murdered two-year-old James Bulger in Liverpool in 1993 would have got away with the crime. He said this was ‘not true’, adding: ‘They would have been treated in a different kind of way, but they would not have got away with it.’ Critics, however, last night said victims would be let down if juveniles did not face court for serious offences. Tory MP Nick de Bois said: ‘It’s an affront to common sense to presume young offenders of  11 or 12 who steal cars, assault people or trash people’s homes are unaware they are doing wrong.’ James Bulger’s mother Denise Fergus also attacked the suggestion, saying: ‘It is right that the politicians and judges should always remember what happened to James, the evil that was in his killers and the evil that lies there to this day.’ The age at which children in England and Wales can be prosecuted was set at ten in 1963. Until recently, Lord McNally stated publicly this was appropriate. Calling for a review: Minister of State for Justice Lord McNally . But after being made chairman of the Youth Justice Board, a quango that funds child custody places, he is expressing a different view. Asked by Children & Young People Now magazine if he backed a review of the age limit, he replied: ‘Yes.’ Ministers have faced calls from the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child to raise the age of criminal responsibility. The Youth Justice Board said Lord McNally was speaking personally and the age of criminal responsibility was a matter for the Justice Secretary.","Lord McNally suggests raising age of criminal responsibility to 12 .

"By . Simon Cable Showbusiness Correspondent . Lament: Three years on from her last outing in the blockbuster Harry Potter franchise, Emma Watson has admitted finding it difficult to land more mature film roles . She is still best-known for her turn playing wholesome teenage wizard Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter series. But three years on from her last outing in the blockbuster franchise, Emma Watson has admitted finding it difficult to land ‘adult’ film roles, claiming a refusal to ‘sex herself up’ means she is often over-looked for more mature parts. The 23-year-old actress has landed a number of high-profile acting jobs since the final Harry Potter film was released in 2011. She has landed a bit-part role as a wardrobe assistant in 2001 film, My Week with Marilyn, a college student in The Perks of Being a Wallflower the following year, and a teenage gang member in The Bling ring in 2013. She is now playing the adopted daughter of Russell Crowe’s character in upcoming biblical epic, Noah. Away from the screen she has worked as a model for upmarket fashion house, Burberry. However, she has now said that she struggles to convince people she is capable of playing older characters because of the more classy outfits she wears away from the screen. She told Elle Magazine: ‘In my downtime, I don’t sex myself up much. Sometimes I have a hard time convincing directors that I can play more adult roles.’ She added: ‘I was being offered roles that I didn’t feel were very complicated. Women that were one dimensional. Roles that required me to be one thing, but real women never are.’ Miss Watson’s Harry Potter co-star Daniel Radcliffe has won a slew of role in which he plays older characters. He played widowed lawyer Arthur Kipps in 2012 horror film The Woman in Black, and is preparing to take the role of Igor in a new adaption of Frankenstein. Miss Watson enrolled at Brown University in the US after filming finished on Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. She is currently studying English Literature and is due to graduate later this year. She decided to take a break from her acting career in order to experience a more normal life after appearing the Harry Potter films between the ages of nine and 21. She has also gone on to become a qualified yoga instructor. Famous role: Emma is still best-known for her turn playing wholesome teenage wizard Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter series . New project: The actress is now playing the adopted daughter of Russell Crowe's character in upcoming biblical epic, Noah . She added in the interview with Elle magazine: ‘I just don’t want a life where I can’t have a life. ‘I remember reading this thing that Elizabeth Taylor wrote. She had her first kiss in character on a movie set. It really struck me. I had this sense that if I really wasn’t really careful, that could be me. That my first kiss could be in somebody else’s clothes. ‘And my experiences could all belong to someone else.’ She said that at times she worried that she had done the wrong thing by going to university, thinking: ‘I don’t know if I can do this, or if this is sensible any more.’ However she added: ‘I just don’t want a life where I can’t have a life.’ More mature: Emma at the GQ Men of the Year awards (left)  and at the Golden Globes (right)","Emma Watson is known for playing Hermione Grainger in Harry Potter .

Some people think pit bulls have a bad reputation, but a pair of former shelter workers in New York formed such a deep bond with one such stray they're scouring the internet to find him again.

"By . Lydia Warren . A 16-year-old girl has committed suicide after posting a farewell video to YouTube. Maddie Yates, from Louisville, Kentucky, uploaded the video entitled 'Important' online and then shared it on her Twitter page before taking her life on Monday night. The video, which has now been taken down, was viewed more than 10,000 times in the first 24 hours after it was posted, the Louisville Courier-Journal reported. 'I know that I'm going to hurt everyone who loves me,' she said, explaining that she had been treated for depression and had been prescribed Prozac. Final message: Maddie Yates is pictured in a YouTube video she posted entitled 'Important' before she took her life on Monday. The video, which was viewed thousands of times, has now been removed . 'But I've been like this for so long, and thereâ€™s still a . chance that the worst day might still be coming. And I just donâ€™t see . how this is a bad idea.' She continued: 'I don't want anyone to feel like it was their . fault. This was my decision, not yours. Iâ€™m the one who messed up, not . you. There's nothing, literally nothing that you could have done.' She added that she had seen no other option than to take her life because 'I am not a good person'. 'You don't even want to know the things that I think... I'm doing literally the whole world a favor. But I love . you, and I'm sorry. And I really, really love you,' she said. There are few further details about the circumstances of her death, but her mother confirmed it on Facebook, saying that moments before her death, her daughter had had the family laughing. 'I want you all to know the this was the worse thing she could have done,' she said, as she urged others to seek help if they felt suicidal. Loss: She said she had been treated for depression and feared that she had not yet seen the worst . Maddie herself had previously tweeted, 'The fact that suicide is an actual option for some people is what really breaks my heart,' and was planning to take part in a fundraising walk for suicide prevention in memory of a friend who passed away nearly one year before Maddie. Last year, she added on Twitter: 'If people who killed themselves could just see how everyone loved them, then maybe they'd take back what they did. But they can't.' Her three-minute video was taken down from YouTube - but by that point it had already been shared by school friends at Louisville Male High School, the Louisville Courier-Journal reported. Before it was removed, Jefferson County Public Schools blocked access to YouTube and Twitter throughout the district in a bid to protect students. Accomplished: Louisville Male High School school paid tribute to Maddie, calling her an 'exceptional student' 'This was an effort to ensure that students who are emotionally impacted could get the help they needed as we worked with officials to address the situation through the most appropriate and efficient channels,' the district said in a statement. But at least one student's father disagreed with the decision, saying that 'trying to ignore what happened isn't going to help anyone'. Male High School also provided 20 grief counselors for students to meet and speak with. 'Male High's thoughts and prayers go out to the Yates' family,' the school tweeted. 'Maddie was an exceptional student and will be missed dearly. #MaleHigh' Her friends have also been sharing tributes online. Yates added that she had seen no other option than to take her life because 'I am not a good person' 'Anyone who knew Maddie knew she always . had the biggest smile on her face!' one wrote. 'Always laughing and giggling. Such a . sweet soul, gone too soon.' 'No Maddie it wasn't a favor at all,' another friend said in response to her video.

"By . Emma Glanfield . David Holmes, pictured, was paralysed after breaking his neck when he was hurled against a wall while acting as a Harry Potter stunt double . A Harry Potter stunt double, who was paralysed in a horrific accident while practising flying scenes for the blockbuster film, has told of the ‘sense of tragedy’ he felt when he realised he would never walk again. David Holmes, who was 25 at the time of the accident, was rehearsing a flying scene involving an explosion for Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows when he was hurled into a wall before plummeting to the ground at the Warner Bros Studios in Leavesden, near Watford, Hertfordshire. The former competitive gymnast remained conscious but told crew members: ‘I can’t feel my legs', before being taken to hospital where he was told he had broken his neck and would be paralysed for life. Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Mr Holmes, now 30, recalled the horrific accident which occurred in January 2009. He said he was thrown against the wall during a stunt and landed on the crash mat underneath. He told the newspaper: ‘My stunt co-ordinator grabbed my hand and said, “Squeeze my fingers”. 'I could move my arm to grab his hand but I couldn’t squeeze his fingers. ‘There was definitely a sense of tragedy for me, but also a sense of sheer determination to beat it and better it.’ Mr Holmes, who worked as Daniel Radcliffe’s body double on all of the Potter films before the accident, was initially taken to A&E at Watford General Hospital, but was later transferred to The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in Stanmore, north-west London, where the extent of his injuries became apparent. A source at the Leavesden-based film studios at the time of the accident said: ‘It is thought he may have been caught by the explosion and hit the ground very hard. ‘He told crew members who went to help him he couldn’t feel anything from the waist down. David Holmes, pictured left wearing a brown wig and glasses, with actor Daniel Radcliffe, right, before the horrific accident occurred in January 2009 . The accident took place at the Warner Bros Studios in Leavesden, Hertfordshire, while the stunt double was practicing flying scenes for Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows, pictured . 'Everyone is just hoping he makes a good recovery. It has come as a terrible shock.’ After the extent of Mr Holmes’ injuries became apparent, several of the Harry Potter cast and crew visited him at the specialist spinal injury unit. Daniel Radcliffe, 24, and Tom Felton, 26, who played Draco Malfoy in the blockbuster movies, both visited the film worker at the hospital and could be seen visibly moved following their visit.

"By . Neil Sears . Royal? Sarah Al Amoudi is believed by some to be a Saudi princess of 'limitless wealth', but Ian Paton told London's High Court she is a conwoman . A so-called Saudi princess accused of defrauding two property developers of £14million claims she had a secret affair with one of them. Sara Al Amoudi – believed by some to be a princess with ‘limitless wealth’ but attacked by her detractors as a prostitute and conwoman – enjoyed romantic holidays with London investor Ian Paton, the High Court heard yesterday. Mr Paton, 45, and his long-term girlfriend and business partner Amanda Clutterbuck, 56, claim they were financially ruined after being lured into giving six exclusive flats in Chelsea and Knightsbridge to Miss Al Amoudi, thinking she was a princess poised to invest millions in a joint property scheme. But the court heard claims that instead of being tricked into giving her the flats, Mr Paton had actually invented the claim of being conned to cover up not only a secret affair with the mysterious ‘royal’ but also his long-term addiction to crack cocaine. According to Miss Al Amoudi, Mr Paton had stolen and borrowed millions from her, and the flats were repayment. He has denied the sex, drugs, thefts and loans allegations. Yesterday it was his partner Miss Clutterbuck, a mother of four who had built up a multimillion-pound fortune from her property dealings, who was forced to deny accusations that Mr Paton was ‘having sexual relations’ with Miss Al Amoudi, said to be aged between 30 and 43. Jonathan Seitler, QC, for Miss Al Amoudi, put it to her that Mr Paton, her partner for almost 20 years and the father of her youngest child, was secretly a crack addict who had lied to her and enjoyed a relationship with the ‘princess’ behind her back. Mr Seitler alleged that Mr Paton had taken trips to Thailand and Amsterdam with Miss Al Amoudi in 2009 without her knowledge. Miss Clutterbuck, who counts the Duke of Gloucester among her friends, admitted Mr Paton had travelled with the ‘princess’ but denied the trips were clandestine, telling the court she had picked him up from the airport on his return. Mr Seitler claimed this was ‘absolute rubbish’. Counter-claims: Miss Al Amoudi (pictured leaving London's High Court) said the allegations made by Mr Paton were invented to cover up their 'affair'. It was alleged that Mr Paton borrowed millions from Miss Al Amoudi and the flats were a repayment . Identity: Miss Al Amoudi, 30, is being sued for £14m by Ian Paton (right) and his long-term girlfriend Amanda Clutterbuck who say she tricked them into handing over properties . He also accused Miss Clutterbuck of ‘confiscating’ her partner’s mobile phone because of her suspicions about the ‘affair’ – something she denied – and concluded by asking her if she flatly  denied sexual relations between Mr Paton and the ‘princess’ had ever taken place. Miss Clutterbuck replied: ‘How can I actually say categorically? All I can go with is being told by Miss Al Amoudi that Ian had a 20-year-old history of crack addiction, that I knew nothing of. He says he has not had sexual relations with her, and I believe him.’ The hearing continues.

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . Updated: . 11:58 EST, 2 January 2012 . Carole Middleton's svelte figure has been attributed to the Dukan diet . Millions are expected to turn to celebrity-led diets in a bid to shed weight gained over the festive break. But a study suggests that trendy weight-loss techniques favoured by the stars are likely to end in failure. Findings show the average 'crash' diet lasts just 15 . days and 35 per cent say they end up putting on more weight than they lost in the first place, with an average 4.7 pounds creeping back on post-diet. The Dukan diet, said to be followed by the Duchess of Cambridge's mother Carole Middleton, Jennifer Lopez and Gisele Bundchen, involves cutting out various food groups and has become increasingly popular over recent years. Meanwhile the low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet Atkins diet remains a favourite despite mixed reviews. However a poll of 2,000 women conducted by Hovis Wholemeal bread suggests that a balanced diet is a more effective way of losing weight in the long-term. Commenting on the study Olympic cyclist Victoria Pendleton said: 'It's worrying to think that . women put pressure on themselves to lose weight quickly and then suffer . emotional repercussions if they give up or don't see the desired . results. 'The secret to a healthy lifestyle is not crash diets.' She added that increasing the amount of exercise will allow dieters to eat more of what they want without packing on any extra weight. Nearly half (48 per cent) of the women questioned said their failed dieting attempts came from trying to cut out . all savoury snacks and one in three (33 per cent) women tried to remove all . bread from their diet. Commenting on the study, Olympic cyclist Victoria Pendleton said: 'It's worrying to think women put pressure on themselves to lose weight quickly and then suffer emotional repercussions if they give up or don't see the desired results. The secret to a healthy lifestyle is not crash diets' The majority of Brits notice the . pounds piling on 22 days after their diets end and only one in . five women successfully reach their target weight. In November the British Dietetic Association issued its annual list of the five worst celebrity diets to avoid in the New Year. Experts named the Dukan Diet, which . works on restricting foods, calories and portion control as the worst . celebrity weight loss plan to follow and said it has 'absolutely no . solid science behind it at all'. Unrealistic: Many women questioned said their failed dieting attempts came from following plans that were too restrictive . The BDA receives hundreds of calls . every year on the subject of diets and analysed results to form a list . of the most unreliable, difficult to follow or unhealthy diet plans. Sian Porter, consultant dietician and . spokesperson for the BDA, said of weight loss fads: 'Sadly, there is no . magic wand you can wave. 'If you have some weight you need to . lose, then do it in a healthy, enjoyable and sustainable way. In the . long term this will achieve the results you are after.

"By . Joel Christie . The president of programming network GitHub has resigned from the company he cofounded in 2008 following an investigation into workplace bullying and sexism. Tom Preston-Werner stepped down on Monday from the website, which is used for sharing and collaborating software codes. His departure follows allegations that surfaced last month concerning disrepect and intimidation to women at the start-up. Software designer and GitHub developer Julie Ann Horvath recently made a high-profile exit from the company that sent ripples through the tech community, claiming she had been mistreated by Preston-Werner and his wife Theresa, who does not work at GitHub but was a fixture in the office. Tech scandal: GitHub president Tom Preston-Werner (left) has resigned from the social network for software engineers that he cofounded in 2008 after he and wife Theresa Preston-Werner (right) were investigated for workplace bullying and harassment . Julie Ann Horvath, a well-known engineer at GitHub, a successful social network for coders, says a toxic workplace forced her out . GitHub engineer Julie Ann Horvath quit last month and has been airing her story on Twitter . While the couple were cleared of any legal wrongdoing in Horvath's harrassment claim following an internal investigation, an independent third-party inquiry found 'evidence of mistakes and errors of judgement' by Preston-Werner and his wife, Gawker reported. GutHub CEO Chris Wanstharth announced Preston-Werner was leaving in a blog post, describing the allegations against the couple as 'sexual or gender-based harassment or retaliation, or of a sexist or hostile work environment'. 'In light of these findings, Tom has submitted his resignation, which the company has accepted,' Wanstharth wrote. 'Tom has been a huge part of this company from the very beginning and we appreciate all that he has done for GitHub. 'We wish him the best in his next endeavour.' Horvath has not publicly named the colleagues that prompted her to leave, however in a detailed interview with TechCrunch she described her version of what happened. The story centered around the wife of one of GitHub's founders who asked her out for drinks and immediately started telling her how she 'informs her husband's decision' at the company and is essentially in charge of the firing and hiring. Outgoing GitHub president Tom Preston-Werner said on Monday that although he had 'made mistakes', he would fight any allegations made against him or his wife 'to the full extent of the law' Horvath said the wife organized the meeting with her to ensure she wouldn't leave the company and bad-mouth them. What followed, she claims, was a series of alleged intimidations, mostly from the wife, who continally showed up at the office, which made her feel like she was being pressured to quit. Horvath also said that her attempts to have people at GitHub - HR, other cofounders - help the situation were useless. She responded to Preston-Werner's resignation with some posts on Twitter. 'Bullying someone into quitting: Illegal,' Horvath wrote. She also Tweeted: 'Pushing women with strong opinions out of your company because they disagree with you is wrong.' But Wanstrath maintained there was no proof of any wrongdoing, according to The New York Times. He did however acknowledge that GitHub was in the process of transforming itself. Julie Ann Horvath, a former GitHub software developer, has gone on to start a program to improve the treatment of women within the tech world after leaving the company last month . 'We want to create a great place to work for all our employees and we can't do that without acknowledging the challenges that exist in providing an inclusive work environment,' he said. 'We are implementing a number of new HR and employee-led initiatives as well as training opportunities to make sure employee concerns and conflicts are taken seriously and dealt with appropriately. 'We know we still have work to do.' Preston-Werner on Monday wrote that while he had 'made mistakes' he was 'prepared to fight any further false claims on this matter to the full extent of the law'. Women account for only one-fifth of software engineers. Horvath is working on a program called Passion Projects that aims to improve the situation of women in tech. It is being devleoped within a new organization called Playing with Possibility and is expanding to New York and Chicago. According to Business Insider, a 2012 valuation of GitHub said the company was worth $750 million.","Tim Preston-Werner resigned on Monday from GitHub, a programming network used to share software codes .

"By . Taylor Auerbach . It was a terrifying near-repeat of the ordeal of Aron Ralston - the canyoneer who became stuck between two rocks in Utah and inspired the film 127 hours. This time the real-life drama was played out in rural Victoria, where an Australian rock climber who became trapped between two huge boulders on Mount Arapiles was forced to spend the night in 'very cold' conditions as rescuers worked desperately to free him. Luckily for the 24-year-old, and unlike Ralston who had to amputate his own arm, his girlfriend was on hand to call authorities and he survived the 10 hours 'wedged' inside the rock with his limbs intact. Scroll down for video . No easy feet: Rescuers were forced to improvise with shampoo and other lubricants to free this 24-year-old man from a crevice in Mt Arapiles . According to the Bureau of Meteorology, the nearby town of Horsham experienced temperatures around 10C overnight, but conditions on elevated Mt Arapiles were likely much colder. Ambulance Victoria officers told the ABC the man was 'extremely hypothermic' and said shampoo, olive oil and other slippery liquids were used to ease the man out of the crevice. 'I believe some of his friends actually went around the campsite at Mt Arapiles waking up a few people just asking for some shampoo or any other lubricants they can find,' Nick Thresher said. 'Funnily enough someone did bring up some motor oil but we declined the use of that one.' Rock and a hard place: Rescuers brought in large heaters to keep the man warm through the 10 hour ordeal . He told Fairfax radio: 'He's been between two very cold rocks for many, many hours. His blood pressure is improving.' The Victorian man was attempting a 'squeeze test' at the location, a popular activity in Mt Arapiles where rock climbers attempt to crawl their way through a tiny gap in a cliff known as 'Tiger Wall'. The man became wedged by his hips around 10pm on Monday night and was freed around 8am the next morning. In a multi-unit response, State Emergency Services volunteers, Victorian police, the Country Fire Authority and local rescue specialists were on hand to help paramedics with the rescue. Delicate operation: Paramedics were fearful the man would suffer from 'crush syndrome' when he was finally freed . They were worried the man would fall victim to a condition known as 'crush syndrome' - a potentially fatal illness caused by toxins being released into the body rapidly after a significant weight is removed. It is believed that because the man was wedged between the boulders, and not bearing any weight, he was ultimately not at risk. The man was medicated during the rescue operation and large heaters were used to prevent him from freezing to death, a police statement read. He remains in a stable condition, a hospital spokeswoman said. The Mt Arapiles squeeze test has plagued climbers in the past and in 2011 a 15-year-old Melbourne boy had to be rescued after getting stuck.","Victorian man gets stuck in Mount Arapiles while attempting 'squeeze test'

Flaming mad: A Chinese firefighter carried this burning propane tank to save it from gutting a restaurant . Oops: A colleague trails behind with a hose - but misses completely at first and douses the man with water . The footage was reportedly shot in China and emerged on a Chinese TV station. It was uploaded to YouTube and LiveLeak and has been viewed more than 25,000 times. It shows the firefighter carrying the propane tank out of a restaurant, most likely to save it from setting the rest of the building on fire. Crews linger inside among the tables as the flames light up the room before one firefighter - brave, stupid or both - takes the drastic action to bring it outside. That is despite the fact the restaurant already appears to be severely damaged by fire. Destroyed: From the video, the building already appeared to be damaged as the tank burned inside . All safe: The firefighters quickly regained control of the situation and two of them gripped the hose . The video provoked a storm of debate about firefighting tactics among online commenters. One said: 'Bravery would be charging into a burning building to save orphans. Stupidity would be hand-carrying a flaming propane tank to save what appears to be a fire-gutted restaurant.' But another pointed out the valves fitted to propane canisters would mean the firefighter was relatively safe. The viewer wrote: 'The tank can't blow, as the gas keeps being pushed out by the pressure, meaning the fire can't get in the tank through the valve.'","Video shows firefighter carrying the tank out of building in his arms .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Miami man's plan to drown his 21-year-old wife in a jacuzzi in order to collect her life insurance policy failed when he couldn't keep her head under the water, a court heard on Monday. Prosecutors labelled Michel Escoto a 'controlling, manipulative schemer' who plotted to murder his spouse, Wendy Trapaga, in October 2002 in order to claim $1 million from her death. In the closing arguments of Escoto's murder trial in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, prosector Gail Levine told jurors that, after his plan failed, Escoto choked and beat Trapaga to death with a tire iron outside a Northwest Miami-Dade warehouse. The closing arguments brought to an end a month of testimony that included more than 20 witnesses and hundreds of pieces of evidence, The Miami Herald reported. Michel Escoto (right) acted as his own attorney until Monday, when stand-by counsel Terry Lenamon (left) stepped in to deliver the defense's closing arguments. Escoto is on trial for the murder of his wife . Michel Escoto listens to ex-girlfriend Yolanda Cerrillo testify in his murder case on Tuesday, March 25, 2014 . Myriam Banitez holds a photo of her daughter Wendy Trapaga and son-in-law Michel Escoto in 2002. Her daugher was found murdered and her husband was charged . Tragic: Wendy Trapaga was allegedly murdered by . her husband of four days and his ex-girlfriend in a scheme to cash in on . an insurance policy . Jurors will begin deliberating Tuesday. Escoto, 42, who represented himself for most of the trial, is charged with first-degree murder and is facing life in prison. Escoto's behavior throughout the trial has caused much courtroom drama. At one point, Circuit Judge Marisa Tinkler Mendez sentenced Escoto to 30 days in jail for contempt of court after he threatened Jorge Borron, the civil lawyer for Trapagas family, who was testifying and proclaimed Escoto a murderer. 'For a moment, you got to see the real Michel Escoto,' Levine told jurors. 'Those are his true colors.' On Monday he surprised observers by allowing 'stand-by' counsel Terry Lenamon to finish the case. Lenamon attacked the prosecution's case, saying the state exaggerated and over-dramatized the evidence during the 'vilification of Michel Escoto'. Yolanda Cerrillo was the star witness in the murder case against Michel Escoto on Tuesday, March 25, 2014. She testified that she helped Escoto plan and carry out the murder of his new bride, Wendy Trapaga, 21, in 2002 . The prosecution called Yolanda Cerillo 'evil, pathetic and selfish' after she admitted to helping murder Wendy Trapaga . 'This is not community theater,' Lenamon said. 'This is a court of law.' Escoto was long the suspect in Trapaga's death. Prosecutors described him as a womanizer who kept several ex-girlfriends, even as he planned Trapaga's demise. He persuaded her to go along with the life insurance policy while pressuring her to marry him in a rushed courthouse wedding. A few days after the ceremony they checked into the Executive Airport Motel at 6700 NW 12th St. To police, he initially claimed the two left the motel after getting into an argument, and she stormed off on her own after dropping him off at their South Beach apartment. The defense speculated that Trapaga, who they had 'multiple boyfriends' and 'was going to sex clubs', met up with someone who was the real killer. Myriam Beneitz, mother of Wendy Trapaga, listens to Yolanda Cerrillo testify in the murder case against Michel Escoto on Tuesday, March 25, 2014 . 'We don't know what occurs after she left the apartment,' Lenamon said. Prosecutors shot back, citing the medical examination of her body - Trapaga was too drugged-up to have been able to drive Escoto home that night. The state also had a powerful witness for the trial. Escoto's ex-girlfriend, Yolanda Cerrillo, who admitted to jurors she helped him plan the murder by grinding up powerful painkillers to knock Trapaga out. Together they also practiced how to drown the young woman, Cerrillo said. She also admitted to whisking him away from the crime scene and agreeing on a cover story. The details were intimate: Cerrillo described how the smell of blood made her so ill she had diarrhea and had to defecate on the side of a causeway as Escoto flung the murder weapon into Biscayne Bay. 'You don't make that up,' Levine said. Cerrillo, 40, a Homestead accountant, began cooperating in 2006, but admitted she failed to tell investigators the full extent of her involvement until August 2011. The state attorney's office, with little evidence against her, had no choice but to grant her immunity from prosecution. 'One sorry, pathetic soul. Evil. Selfish,' Levine told jurors, adding: . 'I can't charge her. I'd love to. But I can't.' Last fall, a civil jury ordered Cerrillo to pay Trapaga's family $44 million in a wrongful death lawsuit. The defense, however, insisted that Cerrillo concocted the entire story only after she believed Escoto might have implicated her.","Michel Escoto is accused of murdering his wife of four days, Wendy Trapaga, in 2002 .

"By . David Mccormack . WNBA star Brittney Griner has written a book about her struggles as a lesbian at Baylor University and how she was warned by her coach to keep ‘her business’ to herself and warned not to express her sexuality in public. Baylor University is a rigidly Baptist university in Texas that discourages students from participating in 'advocacy groups which promote understandings of sexuality that are contrary to biblical teaching.' In her book In My Skin, Griner writes that she was open with Coach Kim Mulkey even before she joined the team. WNBA star Brittney Griner has written a book about her struggles as a lesbian at Baylor University and how she was warned by her coach to keep 'her business' to herself and warned her not to express her sexuality in public . ‘Big Girl, I don’t care what you are,’ Griner recalls Mulkey as saying. ‘You can be black, white, blue, purple, whatever. As long as you come here and do what you need to do and hoop, I don’t care.’ Griner, who is currently playing in China during the WNBA offseason, writes that while she never promoted her sexuality at Bayer, she never hid it, either. She believes the university was conveniently hypocritical about their views on student’s sexuality when it suited them - such as when it came to attracting talented sports stars. ‘The more I think about it, the more I feel like the people who run the school want it both ways: they want to keep the policy, so they can keep selling themselves as a Christian university, but they are more than happy to benefit from the success of their gay athletes. That is, as long as those gay athletes don’t talk about being gay,’ she wrote. In her book In My Skin writes about how she was open about her sexuality with Coach Kim Mulkey even before she joined . Griner was a three-time AP all-American who is the NCAA’s all-time leader in blocked shots, and led the Lady Bears to the 2012 national title. Last year she was named 'Best Female College Athlete' for her 2012-13 season at Baylor at the ESPY Awards, just weeks after officially coming out as gay - ahead of the WNBA draft. At the time she said she was still haunted by the memories of her peers refusing to believe she was a girl, questioning her sexual orientation and even groping her physically. 'I was always taller, my feet were always bigger and my voice was deeper,' said Griner, who is 6 feet 8 with a wingspan of 88 inches. In an honest interview with the Los Angeles Times, the Phoenix Mercury powerhouse described one day in seventh grade when class had just let out and the hallway was flooded with students. Still friends: Griner explained in an interview that Kim Mulkey (right) and staff at Baylor thought being open about sexual preferences could potentially damage the programme's recruitment success and reputation . As Griner made her way through the crowd, a male student stopped her. 'You're a dude,' he said. 'I just stood there and took it. I was humiliated. The whole school was laughing at me,' Griner recalled. 'When I was younger, it really bothered . me to the point where I was like ""I don't even want to be alive; why am I . getting treated like that?""' Griner said. 'But as I got older, I . started caring less.' She said she told her mother she liked girls after her first day of high school. 'I felt a release, I felt better,' Griner said. 'She was so cool about it. She was like ""I kinda already know, and I love you.""' Her father, a former Marine, didn't take it so well and tension between the two saw Griner move out in her senior year. Bullying: The Phoenix Mercury star was bullied at school, with some peers even calling her 'a dude' Tall: 'I was always taller, my feet were always bigger and my voice was deeper,' said Griner, who is 6 feet 8 and has a wingspan of 88 inches . Despite her tumultuous home life, on . court she shone, leading her team from Houston's Nimitz High to the . Texas Division 5A girls' basketball state championship game and becoming . America's most sought after recruit. But she was still subject to nasty taunts from opposing sides, which left her regularly crying alone in her room after games, she said. She went off to college at Baylor with a resolution to block out the negativity and not let bullying affect her. And by the end of sophomore year she succeeded. But she said she chose to publicly come out last April, regardless of the fallout, to give young girls experiencing the same nightmare someone to look up to. 'I didn't have a real role model that I could look up to that was out openly,' she told The Times. 'I knew there were a lot of younger girls that needed someone.' History: Griner (pictured hugging Mulkey) was named 'Best Female College Athlete' for her 2012-13 season at Baylor at the ESPY Awards last year . Though Griner said she never hid the . fact that she was gay from friends and family, she found at Baylor there . was 'an unwritten law' that players shouldn't discuss their sexual . preferences. Speaking to ESPN last May, she recalled: '... it was just kind of, like, one of those things, you know, just don't do . it. They kind of tried to make it, like, 'Why put your business out on . the street like that?'"" She explained that when Kim Mulkey recruited her, she was honest about who she was. 'I told Coach [Mulkey] when she was . recruiting me. I was like, ""I'm gay. I hope that's not a problem,"" and . she told me that it wasn't,' Griner said. 'I mean, my teammates knew, . obviously they all knew. Everybody knew about it.' But when one of Griner's tweets to an . ex-girlfriend was noticed by an staffer at Baylor, she was told to take . the post down by 'someone in the office.' 'It was a recruiting thing,' Griner . added. 'The coaches thought that if it seemed like they condoned it, . people wouldn't let their kids come play for Baylor.'","The Phoenix Mercury star came out as a lesbian before the WNBA draft last April .

"By . Misty White Sidell . A new bill recently introduced to Congress would exercise some control over the use of Photoshop in advertising. Two Congresswomen, Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R) and Representative Lois Capps (D), of Florida and California, respectively, have introduced a bill titled H.R. 4341: Truth in Advertising Act of 2014. If passed, the bill would provide corporations with strategies for reducing their use of altered images, as well as guidelines for the appropriate uses of Photoshop.

At present, advertising officials appear skeptical of how much impact the legislation could actually have.

"By . Associated Press . A majority of Americans do not believe that the Big Bang created the universe 13.8 billion years ago, according to a new study, with Americans also expressing a large amount of skepticism in global warming, the age of the Earth and evolution. Rather than quizzing scientific knowledge, the survey asked people to rate their confidence in several statements about science and medicine. On some, there's broad acceptance. Just 4 percent doubt that smoking causes cancer, 6 percent question whether mental illness is a medical condition that affects the brain and 8 percent are skeptical there's a genetic code inside our cells. More — 15 percent — have doubts about the safety and efficacy of childhood vaccines. Few Americans question that smoking causes cancer. But they express bigger doubts as concepts that scientists consider to be truths get further from our own experiences and the present time . About 4 in 10 say they are not too . confident or outright disbelieve that the earth is warming, mostly a . result of man-made heat-trapping gases, that the Earth is 4.5 billion . years old or that life on Earth evolved through a process of natural . selection, though most were at least somewhat confident in each of those . concepts. But a narrow majority — 51 percent — questions the Big Bang . theory. Those results . depress and upset some of America's top scientists, including several . Nobel Prize winners, who vouched for the science in the statements . tested, calling them settled scientific facts. 'Science ignorance is pervasive in our society, and these attitudes are reinforced when some of our leaders are openly antagonistic to established facts,' said 2013 Nobel Prize in medicine winner Randy Schekman of the University of California, Berkeley. The poll highlights 'the iron triangle of science, religion and politics,' said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication. And scientists know they've got the shakiest leg in the triangle. To the public 'most often values and beliefs trump science' when they conflict, said Alan Leshner, chief executive of the world's largest scientific society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Political values were closely tied to views on science in the poll, with Democrats more apt than Republicans to express confidence in evolution, the Big Bang, the age of the Earth and climate change. Confidence in evolution, the Big Bang, the age of the Earth and climate change decline sharply as faith in a supreme being rises, according to the poll. Likewise, those who regularly attend religious services or are evangelical Christians express much greater doubts about scientific concepts they may see as contradictory to their faith. 'When you are putting up facts against faith, facts can't argue against faith,' said 2012 Nobel Prize winning biochemistry professor Robert Lefkowitz of Duke University. 'It makes sense now that science would have made no headway because faith is untestable.' But evolution, the age of the Earth and the Big Bang are all compatible with God, except to Bible literalists, said Francisco Ayala, a former priest and professor of biology, philosophy and logic at the University of California, Irvine. And Darrel Falk, a biology professor at Point Loma Nazarene University and an evangelical Christian, agreed, adding: 'The story of the cosmos and the Big Bang of creation is not inconsistent with the message of Genesis 1, and there is much profound biblical scholarship to demonstrate this.' In addition to disbelief in the Big Bang, a high amount of Americans also doubt that earth is over 4.5 billion years old . Beyond religious belief, views on science may be tied to what we see with our own eyes. The closer an issue is to our bodies and the less complicated, the easier it is for people to believe, said John Staudenmaier, a Jesuit priest and historian of technology at the University of Detroit Mercy. Marsha Brooks, a 59-year-old nanny who lives in Washington, D.C., said she's certain smoking causes cancer because she saw her mother, aunts and uncles, all smokers, die of cancer. But when it comes to the universe beginning with a Big Bang or the Earth being about 4.5 billion years old, she has doubts. She explained: 'It could be a lack of knowledge. It seems so far' away. Jorge Delarosa, a 39-year-old architect from Bridgewater, N.J., pointed to a warm 2012 without a winter and said, 'I feel the change. There must be a reason.' But when it came to Earth's beginnings 4.5 billion years ago, he has doubts simply because 'I wasn't there.' Experience and faith aren't the only things affecting people's views on science. Duke University's Lefkowitz sees 'the force of concerted campaigns to discredit scientific fact' as a more striking factor, citing significant interest groups — political, business and religious — campaigning against scientific truths on vaccines, climate change and evolution. Yale's Leiserowitz agreed but noted sometimes science wins out even against well-financed and loud opposition, as with smoking. Widespread belief that smoking causes cancer 'has come about because of very public, very focused public health campaigns,' AAAS's Leshner said. A former acting director of the National Institute of Mental Health, Leshner said he was encouraged by the public's acceptance that mental illness is a brain disease, something few believed 25 years ago, before just such a campaign. That gives Leiserowitz hope for a greater public acceptance of climate change. But he fears it may be too late to do anything about it. The AP-GfK Poll was conducted March 20-24, 2014, using KnowledgePanel, GfK's probability-based online panel designed to be representative of the U.S. population. It involved online interviews with 1,012 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points for all respondents. Respondents were first selected randomly using phone or mail survey methods and were later interviewed online. People selected for KnowledgePanel who didn't otherwise have access to the Internet were provided with the ability to access the Internet at no cost to them.","Confidence in evolution, climate change, the age of the Earth, and the Big Bang all decline sharply as faith in a supreme being rises .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Danger: A study found pregnant women who take antibiotics could be tampering with their child's immune system . Pregnant women who take antibiotics could be putting their unborn children at risk of disease. Researchers have found that drugs used to beat infections can interfere with a baby’s immune system. By contrast mothers can help to kick-start a child’s ability to avoid illness by passing on certain germs. A study by the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in the US showed that bacteria in the gut play a crucial role in fostering the rapid production of infection-fighting white blood cells. They found that, as with humans, mice have a surge of white blood cells around birth, but this response is reduced when their mothers are exposed to antibiotics. This left the creatures much more vulnerable to deadly E. coli infections, especially when they were born prematurely. The researchers showed that signalling mechanisms within the gut’s vast colony of micro-organisms regulate the production of white blood cells in baby mice. Exposing both the mothers and babies to antibiotics reduced the diversity of gut bacteria, many of which are beneficial, and also impaired resistance to infection in the newborn. Critically ill babies are often treated with antibiotics as a precaution, without proof of infection. The study appeared in the journal Nature Medicine. Hitesh Deshmukh, first author of the study, said: 'At birth, newborns move from a largely sterile environment to one full of microorganisms. 'Animals and humans adapt to this new situation by ramping up the production of granulocytes within the first days of life.' Doctors advised unborn babies benefit from bacteria which builds up their strength, rather than medication . A similar procedure in humans, called a fecal transplant, has recently been successful in treating severe bacterial infection in adults. However, such transplants have not been performed in newborns, and the scientists warn that a lot more research is needed before they can determine what implications these animal results may have in guiding human treatment. Despite the findings, babies will continue to be treated with antibiotics as it is very difficult to determine whether newborns are infected with bacteria. But the research urged clinicians to strive to decrease antibiotic use as a long-term goal.","Drugs tamper with foetus's developing immune system, researchers found .

"By . Ap . A prison doctor has been fired and two other staffers are in the midst of being dismissed after an inmate at the Kentucky State Penitentiary starved himself to death, a case that has exposed lapses in medical treatment and in how hunger strikes are handled at the facility. Prison officials have asked prosecutors to investigate after The Associated Press began asking questions about the inmate's death. James Kenneth Embry, 57 and with just three years left on a nine-year sentence for drug offenses, began to spiral out of control in the spring of 2013 after he stopped taking anti-anxiety medication. Seven months later, in December, after weeks of erratic behavior â€” from telling prison staff he felt anxious and paranoid to banging his head on his cell door â€” Embry eventually refused most of his meals. Hunger strike: James Kenneth Embry died in January after a four-month hunger strike that was ignored by prison medical staff . By the time of his death in January of this year, he had shed more than 30 pounds on his 6-foot frame and died weighing just 138 pounds, according to documents reviewed by The Associated Press. An internal investigation determined that medical personnel failed to provide him anti-anxiety medication that may have kept his suicidal thoughts at bay and didn't take steps to check on him as his condition worsened. The internal review of Embry's death also exposed broader problems involving the treatment of inmates â€” including a failure to regularly check inmates on medical rounds and communication lapses among medical staff. The AP, tipped off to Embry's death, obtained scores of documents under Kentucky's Open Records Act, including a report detailing the investigation into Embry's death, an autopsy report and personnel files. Along with interviews with corrections officials and correspondence with inmates, the documents describe Embry's increasingly paranoid behavior until his death and the numerous opportunities for various prison staff to have intervened. 'It's just very, very, very disturbing,' said Greg Belzley, a Louisville, Ky.-based attorney who specializes in inmate rights litigation and reviewed some of the documents obtained by the AP. 'How do you just watch a man starve to death?' According to the report of the internal investigation, Embry stopped taking medications for anxiety in May 2013. Seven months later, he told the lead prison psychologist, Jean Hinkebein, on Dec. 3 that he felt anxious and paranoid and wanted to restart those medications. But the psychologist concluded Embry didn't have any significant mental health issues even though Embry repeatedly talked about wanting to hurt himself. Hinkebein and an associate considered his comments vague, and his request for medication was denied. Seven days later, on Dec. 10, Embry began banging his head on his cell door and was moved to an observation cell where he refused meals and told the prison psychologist, 'I don't have any hope.' He soon began refusing most food, though he drank team on occasion while continuing to make threats to hurt himself in the ensuing weeks. Dismissed: One doctor already has been fired and another is on his way out after allowing Embry to starve to death at the Kentucky State Penitentiary . A nurse checked on Embry on Jan. 4, finding him weak and shaky, and advised him to resume eating. Embry responded that it had been too long for him to start taking food again. Nine days later, on the very day he died, an advanced practice registered nurse named Bob Wilkinson refused a request from other medical staffers to move him to the infirmary at 11:51 a.m. and said the inmate should be taken off a hunger strike watch, according to the internal investigative report. Guards found Embry unresponsive in his cell hours later, his head slumped to the side. He was pronounced dead at 5:29 p.m. Lyon County Coroner Ronnie Patton classified Embry's death as a suicide and listed dehydration as the primary cause of death, with starvation and several other medical ailments as secondary causes. The documents obtained by the AP show a prison system with a dated protocol for handling hunger strikes, staff who weren't familiar with its provisions, and others who said they were told not to follow them. In Embry's case, those in charge of his well-being were simply counting on him to cave in and start eating again on his own, the records show. On Jan. 16, three days after Embry's death, Steve Hiland, the lead physician at the maximum-security prison, signed off on a nurse's note about Embry consistently refusing food and being taken off of the hunger strike watch because he drank tea. During the internal investigation, Hiland said he believed a hunger strike consisted of missing 'six or eight meals' and ended when the inmate ate or drank anything at all. In a revealing exchange, investigators asked Hiland how he thought inmates are supposed to be removed from a hunger strike. Hiland told them that prison staff 'usually don't have to worry about it because they (the inmates) eventually give up.' When Embry stopped eating regularly, the Corrections Department's existing guidelines recommended multiple checks of the inmate's vital signs three times a week , repeated visits with a physician and ongoing evaluations by a psychologist. Medical staff would later tell internal investigators they were either unfamiliar with the protocols for handling a hunger strike or that Hiland and Wilkinson forbade those procedures from being used. There is no mention of whether anyone considered force-feeding the inmate. Corrections investigators determined Embry continued to refuse most food, though he drank tea on occasion while continuing to make threats to hurt himself in the ensuing weeks. Investigators concluded that Embry refused 35 of 36 meals before his death. The state has placed Hinkebein, who is also in private practice in Central City, Ky., on administrative leave, and said it is in the process of firing her and her associate. Hinkebein declined to comment, saying she's still a state employee. 'Give up': Dr. Hiland told prison officials they shouldn't worry about hunger strikes because the inmates will often 'give up' and start eating . The internal investigation found that Hiland and Wilkinson didn't check on inmates as they should have during routine visits. The report also documented multiple communication problems among medical staff and allegations that other nurses were intimidated by Wilkinson, a contract staffer who works for Nashville, Tenn.-based Correct Care Solutions. Phone and email messages left with the company seeking comment from managers there and from Wilkinson were not returned. Hiland said the Corrections Department used Embry's death as an excuse to fire him so that Correct Care Solutions could fill his $164,554-a-year job more cheaply. Since firing Hiland last month, the state has given the Corrections Department's medical chief, Douglas Crall, direct oversight of medical care at the penitentiary. The state has also hired the company on a one-year contract worth $14.8 million to provide nurses for all 12 of Kentucky's prisons. 'I never saw this guy, never met him,' Hiland said of Embry. 'I was convinced it was a way to get rid of me. I was told I should have known about it.' Hiland, who maintained a private practice in Eddyville, a town of 2,500, while he was in charge of health care at the nearby penitentiary, didn't address the state's claims directly, saying only that he was on vacation when Embry died and did nothing wrong. It's not the first time his work has been called into question. The doctor has been sued in federal court 103 times since 1992 by inmates and their attorneys. While many of the lawsuits filed were dismissed, Hiland reached an undisclosed settlement with the family of one inmate who died after Hiland repeatedly diagnosed him as faking illness. U.S. District Judge Thomas B. Russell Jr., in declining to dismiss the family's lawsuit against Hiland, wrote that the attention paid to the inmate's medical complaints was 'so cursory as to amount to no treatment at all.' The Kentucky Attorney General's Office criminal review of Embry's death is ongoing, Daniel Kemp, a spokesman for Attorney General Jack Conway, told the AP. Once the investigation is complete, corrections officials will decide whether to file complaints with the licensing boards overseeing the doctors and Wilkinson, department spokeswoman Lisa Lamb said. 'We are still reviewing all possibilities, which is one reason we asked an outside agency to look at our investigation in order to see if any other actions were warranted,' Lamb said. Embry, a heating and air conditioning repairman by trade, had no family or friends visit him at the prison, and no one claimed his remains. He is buried in a potter's field near the penitentiary.","One prison doctor already has been fired over the death of inmate James Embry .

"By . Associated Press . From the disappearances of aviator Amelia Earhart to labor union leader Jimmy Hoffa, there's just something about a good mystery that Americans find too tantalizing to resist. Perhaps that's why the saga of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has continued to rivet the country long after people elsewhere have moved on. From the beginning, the story has bubbled with enough drama to rival a good Hollywood whodunit. And even though it unfolded on the other side of the world with only three Americans on board, many were sucked in anyway. 'This story has many ingredients of compelling drama, particularly early on: lives at stake, mystery unsolved, a race against time, human emotion,' Tom Rosenstiel, executive director of the American Press Institute, said in an email. The search continues: Flight officer Rayan Gharazeddine on board a Royal Australian Air Force AP-3C Orion, searches for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 in southern Indian Ocean, Australia . Mysterious: From the disappearances of aviator Amelia Earhart to labor union leader Jimmy Hoffa, there's just something about a good mystery that Americans find too tantalizing to resist . But why did interest remain so high in the U.S. when the story lost steam elsewhere? It dropped from most Australian front pages and websites weeks ago, despite the search being coordinated off its western coast. CNN International, CNN's overseas network, tapered its coverage when other big news broke, such as the crisis in Ukraine and the Oscar Pistorius trial in South Africa. But CNN in the U.S. continued its heavy focus on the plane. Even in China, where two-thirds of the passengers were from, reports never ran nonstop on TV and the clamor on social media also died down. March 8: Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 loses contact with air traffic controllers between ne and two hours after takeoff . March 9: Radar indicates flight may have turned back from its scheduled route to Beijing . March 11: Interpol names two Iranian men who got on jet with stolen passports . March 12: Search expands to area from China to India . March 15: Malaysian authorities say they believe 'deliberate action' caused the plane to veer off course and someone shut down its tracking systems. March 20: Search teams spot possible wreckage in Southern Indian Ocean, 1,500 miles off western coast of Australia . March 24: Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak says it is 'beyond any doubt' that the 239 passengers and crew perished in the Indian Ocean. March 30: Daughter of pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah says her father recently acted strangely . April 7: Australian ship Ocean Shielf detects underwater signals consistent with black boxes . April 9: Ocean Shield detects two more signals . April 11: Australian authorities pinpoint location . April 14: Bluefin submarine began its underwater search for missing flight MH370 . April 16: 'No significant detections' found, according to Australian officials . April 19: The search area for the missing MH370 plane is narrowed . April 21: Bluefin submarine embarks on its ninth search mission . But Americans yearned for more. Many . found it impossible to believe that a modern Boeing 777 carrying 239 . people could just vanish without a trace in an age where an iPhone can . be tracked just about anywhere. Part of the obsession may also revolve around the country's gotta-know-now mentality and its social media addiction that gets fed 24/7 by the latest breaking news, raw footage or photos going viral on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. Since the plane disappeared, it has consistently been one of the top five most-read stories on The Associated Press' mobile app. And so Americans tuned in to watch the latest developments. And when there were no new developments, they stayed glued to their smartphones because the suspense of not knowing — or possibly missing something new — somehow spiked when nothing was going on. From oil slicks to pings from dying black boxes, each new lead provided a salacious morsel that drove viewers to wonder: Will this be it? 'I find myself drawn into watching or reading about it because it has taken on seemingly mythic worldwide importance,' Paul Mones, an attorney from Portland, Oregon, wrote in an email. 'In this modern world we simply refuse to accept that something so concrete can get so out of our physical reach and understanding. ... People just refuse to concede that the cause of the disaster will likely forever remain unknown.' After six weeks of breathless reporting, not one shred of hard evidence has been found from the jetliner. An unmanned underwater submarine is . now using sonar to comb the ocean floor at a depth exceeding 4.5 . kilometers (2.8 miles) off the west coast of Australia. It . is desperately trying to spot something — anything — that resembles . wreckage in an area where signals believed to be coming from the plane's . dying black boxes were heard. Conspiracy theories: Perhaps that's why the saga of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has continued to rivet Americans long after people elsewhere have moved on . All hands on deck: Crew on board survey ship HMS Echo in the southern Indian Ocean helping in the underwater search for the flight recorder from the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 . A mid-air explosion: The lack of debris could be explained by it falling into Malaysian jungle . A terrorist attack: Director of CIA has said terrorism could not be ruled out . Power failure: Possibly caused by deliberate cutting of power to communication instruments . Electronic warfare: 20 passengers on board were experts in this technology. Hijacking: Radar data indicates the plane might have made a U-turn. A pilot error: There is a chance of them in all air mysteries, claim experts . Structural failure: Possibly involving damage sustained by an accident in 2012 . Pilot suicide: There were two large jet crashes in the late 1990s caused by this . Aeronautical black hole: Plane is stranded hundreds of miles from current search area . According to the latest survey by the Pew Research Center conducted April 3-6, the missing plane remained the top news story in the U.S., with 33 percent of people saying they followed it over a deadly shooting at Fort Hood Army base, developments related to Ukraine and President Obama's health care overhaul. That's down from 39 percent in the previous March questionnaire, when nearly half of those asked said they thought the hunt for Flight 370 was being given the right amount of coverage. CNN covered the drama heavily for weeks, once breaking into one of its programs to report that objects recovered from the sea could be trash — which is exactly what they proved to be. They featured tons of go-to footage from a flight simulator and a nonstop spool of speculation from talking heads. Everyone had a theory, with some . sounding more like a Twilight Zone rerun than a newscast: Could a black . hole or even something supernatural be behind the aircraft's March 8 . disappearance? CNN declined to comment for this story despite repeated requests. Headline news: Interest in the plane's disappearance has waned in other countries, but there appears to be an insatiable appetite for the story in the USA . Non-stop coverage: CNN wasn't the only media outlet covering MH370, just the most tenacious one . Last week, Miami Herald columnist Leonard Pitts, Jr., begged CNN to scale it back. 'Enough, already,' he wrote. 'Give us a break from the missing plane. ... Put your hands up and step away from the story.' Even though its coverage was mocked by 'The Daily Show"" and spoofed by 'Saturday Night Live,' 'Americans kept watching, and the 24-hour news network's ratings kept soaring. CNN reported itself that its all-important 25- to 54-year-old viewer demographic more than doubled after its plane reporting began. A month and a half into the massive search that has involved scores of countries scouring thousands upon thousands of ocean miles, the plane was still among the top three stories Sunday on Google news. CNN winner: When big, international news breaks, viewers still flock to CNN, and MH370 is a reminder of that . Ratings winnger: The network doubled its viewership in the key 25-54 demographic during March, since the aircraft vanished . The only new development was that the robotic submarine was expected to finish its sweep of the seabed in a week. A combination of popular TV shows and a history peppered with real-life detective dramas, from who shot President John F. Kennedy to the identity of Watergate source 'Deep Throat,' may have been factors that tempted Americans to latch onto it. 'It's almost like all the seasons of 'Lost' was the promotional period for this story,' said Robert Thompson, a pop culture expert at Syracuse University. 'We have always kind of put a lot of our popular national narrative into these mysteries and conspiracies and all of the rest of it,' he added. 'And this is a pretty powerful one.'","Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 plane disappeared seven weeks ago .

"By . Lydia Warren . Jeff Bauman today returned to the Boston Marathon finish line - the spot where he lost both of his legs in the deadly bombings last year. Bauman, who used his prosthetic legs and crutches to stand, cheered racers alongside his pregnant fiancee, Erin Hurley, and fellow survivor Adrianne Haslet-Davis, a dancer who lost one of her feet. He also sat just a few feet away from Carlos Arredondo, who became known as 'the man in the cowboy hat' after he was pictured rushing an ashen-faced Bauman to medical care last year. The two men, who have become firm friends since the tragedy brought them together, were pictured fist pumping and laughing together. Scroll down for video .

Brought together: He shared a hug with fellow survivor, Adrianna Haslet-Davis, who lost a foot . 'It feels great' to be back, Bauman said. 'I feel very safe.' It was Bauman's first time back to the scene since the two bombs exploded last year, killing three, wounding more than 260 people and claiming both of his legs. But since the tragic day, the 28-year-old has battled surgeries to get back on his feet again with the help of friends, relatives, colleagues and one-time strangers. Last week, on the one-year anniversary of the April 15 attack, he penned an open letter to the city of Boston, thanking everyone for their kindness. Reunion: He is pictured fist bumping Carlos Arredondo, who helped save his life after he was hit by the bomb . Bond: Bauman and Arredondo, whose two sons died before the marathon, have become firm friends . Hero: A year earlier, Arredondo was pictured rushing Bauman to safety with other emergency responders .

Strong: Student Devin Wang, rear, pushes a runner - a year after she helped rush Bauman to safety . In the letter, he thanked those people who rushed to his aid - 'without your courage, I would not be alive today' - doctors, nurses and police officers: 'You acted like we were people, not victims.' He also thanked people across the country for sending messages, gifts and donations. 'Especially the children who broke open their piggy banks to send us their life savings,' he wrote. 'Thank you. You changed our lives.' In an interview with ABC last week, his rescuer Arredondo revealed he still suffers flashbacks, is unable to sleep and is uneasy in large crowds. His wife Melida said she also suffers from nightmares and sees a counselor. But the couple, who lost both of their sons - one to a sniper in Iraq and the other to suicide - said that the bombings have allowed them a second chance at family. 'Jeff and Erin, they fill a place - they never could never replace Alex or Brian - but having them in our lives eases things,' Melida Arredondo said. 'It helps, and we just enjoy spending time together.' On Monday morning, nearly 36,000 runners set out from the Boston Marathon starting line in a 'Boston Strong' show of resilience a year after the bombing. To the delight of the crowd, an American won the men's division for the first time in more than three decades, dominating a field that included many athletes who were prevented from finishing last year. Meb Keflezighi's time of 2:08:37 made him the first U.S. male to win the storied foot race since 1983, and the 39-year-old crossed the finish line to a roaring crowd. Winner: Meb Keflezighi of the U.S. reacts as he wins the men's division at the Boston Marathon on Monday . 'It was my dream to win Boston and to make it just like the Red Sox did and do the same thing for the people,' Keflezighi said after the race. The names of bombing victims Martin Richard, 8, Krystle Campbell, 29,  and Lu Lingzi, 23, were written on his bib. MIT Officer Sean Collier, shot dead 3 days after the marathon, was also included. Police were deployed in force along the route, with helicopters circling above and bomb-sniffing dogs checking through trash cans. Officers were posted on roofs. Boston Marathon race director Dave McGillivray said it had been a long and difficult year. 'We're taking back our race,' he said. 'We're taking back the finish line.'","Bauman was joined by his pregnant fiancee Erin and one of his rescuers, Carlos Arredondo, at the finish line on Monday .

"By . Associated Press . and Francesca Chambers . Vice President Joe Biden traveled to Kiev, Ukraine on Sunday night for a two-day trip to meet with leaders of the country. Biden arrived in Kiev on Monday afternoon local time. Upon arrival he was briefed on the situation in Ukraine by the U.S. ambassador to the country. He also met with U.S. embassy staff and a delegation of eight members of Congress who are also in the country on official business. Scroll down for video .

U.S. Vice President Joe Biden (left) is greeted by Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Deshchytsia at the airport outside Kiev, Ukraine on Monday . President Barack Obama did not accompany . Biden on the trip to Kiev. Instead, he will make a previously scheduled . visit on Tuesday to Oso, Washington, where 39 people were killed in a . mudslide earlier this month. Tomorrow, Biden will meet with acting Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy . Yatsenyuk and President Oleksander Turchinov and Ukrainian legislators from across the country. Ukraine's Prime Minister and Biden will then speak to the press. Afterward, Biden will meet with a group of civil society leaders before returning to Washington on Tuesday night. Discussions with Ukrainian leaders will include 'the . international community's efforts to help stabilize and strengthen . Ukraine's economy and to assist Ukraine in moving forward on . constitutional reform, decentralization, anti-corruption efforts, and . free and fair presidential elections on May 25th,' the Vice President's office said in a statement. A senior White House official told reporters on the trip that the Vice President would also talk with leaders about new economic, energy and governance assistance the U.S. will be offering Ukraine. In terms of economic assistance, the U.S. will not offer the country new monetary aid. Rather, the White House is offering to put troops on the ground in Ukraine to ensure that the $1 billion guaranteed loan from U.S. is allocated fairly throughout all of Ukraine, the official explained. Biden's visit comes after violence erupted in eastern Ukraine on Easter, despite an agreement last week aimed at easing tensions. A . shootout Sunday at a checkpoint in eastern Ukraine manned by pro-Russia . insurgents left at least three dead, and Ukrainian and Russian . officials traded accusations of blame. The armed clash followed Thursday's . announcement in Geneva that talks between Ukraine, Russia, the United . States and the European Union had produced an agreement to take . tentative steps toward calming the volatile situation. Armed Pro-Russian men secure the area on the street in Slovyansk, eastern Ukraine.

A pro-Russian man shows Ukrainian activist and journalist Irma Krat to journalists in eastern Ukraine on Monday after pro-Russian insurgents arrested her. She is being held captive by pro-Russian activists . Russia's Foreign Ministry quickly blamed militant Ukrainian nationalists in Sunday's attack. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused Kiev of 'a crude violation of the agreements reached in Geneva' to ease tensions. 'The authorities (in Kiev) aren't doing anything, didn't lift a finger to eliminate the causes that are the basis for the deep crisis today in Ukraine,' he told a news conference. The Ukrainian Security Service, however, said the attack was staged by provocateurs from outside the country. 'The situation regarding the incident outside of Slavyansk is still very murky,' a senior Obama administration told reporters aboard Air Force 2 on Monday. The official called on Russia to use its influence on pro-Russian forces in the country to get them to de-arm and de-occupy government buildings. If the Russia continues on a 'destabilizing' course in Ukraine, the U.S. will impose 'mounting costs' on Russia, he said. The official declined to put a timetable on those costs, but said it wouldn't be 'an . open-ended process.' 'This is going to be a situation where we take stock . and determine in the relatively near term what our next step should be,' he said. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney also refused to explain on Monday what those 'costs' would be or when they would be implemented. He reiterated to reporters during his daily briefing that those costs would 'escalate' if Russia escalated its activity in the country. U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt laid out a slightly less vague timeline for when the Obama administration would take action if Russia does not comply with the agreement made in Geneva, Switzerland last week. 'We're talking days, not weeks,' he said, according to the White House pool report. Pyatt said it's still 'too early' to know if the agreement would ultimately prevail. 'The ball is really in Moscow's court in terms of whether they're going to take this diplomatic off-ramp.' Specifically, pro-Russian activists and insurgents would need to stop illegally occupying government buildings in order to be in compliance with the agreement, he said. The U.S. ambassador also condemned pro-Russian insurgents' recent arrests of journalists. Pyatt called the arrests a 'particularly ugly turn' in the situation. Pro-Russian protesters attend a rally in downtown Kharkiv, Ukraine, on Monday. Pro-Russian activists are demanding broader autonomy from Kiev and closer ties to Russia . Pro-Russian protestors have continued occupying government, police and other administrative buildings in eastern Ukrainian cities, in defiance of an ultimatum by the Ukrainian government to lay down their weapons .","On Sunday night Vice President Joe Biden traveled to Kiev, Ukraine.

"By . Reuters . Cellphones smuggled into prisons by corrupt guards, concealed in food containers or hurled over security fences are an increasing worry for law enforcement as prisoners use them to intimidate witnesses, direct drug deals and plan escapes. The concerns about these contraband devices came into the national spotlight this month when U.S. officials accused a member of the notorious Bloods gang serving a life sentence in North Carolina of using a mobile phone hidden in his prison cell to arrange the kidnapping of the father of a woman who prosecuted him. There are no widely available reliable figures on how many cellphones are in the hands of the 2.3 million inmates in local, state and federal prisons in the United States, but statistics point to a swift rise of the problem. Mobile phones seized by Mississippi authorities at prisons across the state are collected in this undated picture. Cellphones smuggled into prisons by corrupt guards, concealed in food containers or by being hurled over security fences . In California, for instance, the number of contraband cellphones discovered by corrections staff jumped to more than 15,000 in 2011, more than 10 times the 1,400 seized in 2007. 'Prison officials used to have to worry about cigarettes and drugs and other weapons. Now it's cellphones,' said Tod Burke, a criminal justice professor at Radford University in Virginia. ""Make no mistake about it, the cellphones are as dangerous or even more dangerous than the other contraband."" States are taking a variety of steps to crack down on prison cellphone possession, starting with passing laws that make it a crime, said Burke, a former police officer. In addition to using metal detectors, X-ray body scanners, pat downs and WiFi signal searches, many enlist police dogs trained to sniff out phones. In March, Mississippi's corrections department said it would spend $1.3 million to install high netting barriers at its prisons to keep items from being lobbed over fences. Cellphones are sometimes hidden inside basketballs, footballs or tennis balls, even delivered by shooting an arrow over the wall, experts said. Gang members are smuggling phones, which allow inmates to plan murders, conduct gang business, and intimidate witnesses {Stock photo} . Mississippi plans to expand use of technology that allows authorities to block unauthorized calls within a prison. The system has stopped nearly 6 million illegal cellphone calls and texts since its 2010 launch, according to the state. 'I lose a lot of sleep worrying about cellphones,' Mississippi Corrections Commissioner Christopher Epps, who serves as president of the American Correctional Association, said in a statement. 'We have proof they have been used in escapes, to put hits out on people, and for other criminal activities.' Maryland officials also said this year that they had purchased 'managed access' technology for the city detention center in crime-plagued Baltimore as part of an intensified push against contraband cellphones. A federal indictment in November said the proliferation of cellphones enabled leaders of the Black Guerilla Family prison gang to coordinate crimes such as drug trafficking, money laundering and murder from the Baltimore jail. In North Carolina, law enforcement officials said prison inmate Kelvin 'Dizzy' Melton used a mobile phone to give instructions on how to kill a prosecutor's father and dispose of his body. Kidnappers snatched Frank Janssen, 63, from his home in Wake Forest on April 5 and held him hostage in an Atlanta apartment until federal agents rescued him four days later. Eight people, including Melton, have been charged in the abduction. Law enforcement officials would not comment on how Melton obtained the cellphone, but said he smashed it when authorities arrived to confiscate it. An investigation is ongoing, North Carolina prisons director George Solomon said. 'This has been an ongoing battle for several years,' Solomon said. 'It's a major security problem for us.' In March 2014, the Mississippi corrections department said that they would spend $1.3 million to install higher barriers at prisons, to prevent items from being thrown over the walls .","Member of notorious Bloods street gang caught using hidden cell phone to arrange kidnapping of prosecutor's father .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The grandson of former President Jimmy Carter, who currently is running for governor in Georgia, implied Monday that should he become the next governor of the Peach State he will not put an end to state license plates that feature the Confederate flag. Since 2003, Georgia has offered a license plate backed by the group Sons of Confederate Veterans that prominently displays the 'stars and bars.' In February, the group redesigned the plates to make the flag stand out even more, which outraged civil rights groups. During an appearance on MSNBC's The Daily Rundown, Democratic Georgia state Senator Jason Carter said Georgians have the right to display the plates, and that he wouldn't - and likely couldn't - do anything to stop the state from doing so. Big footsteps to follow: Jason Carter (right) is running for governor of Georgia, an office once held by his grandfather, former President Jimmy Carter . Stars and Bars: Carter says he wouldn't get rid of specialty plates featuring the Confederate Flag . When asked if he would put a stop to the plates if he's elected governor, Carter says 'I don't know that we could block it, frankly.' He went on to say that he would rather people focus their attention on the role Georgia played in the civil rights movement. 'I would like to see us focus on that great legacy we have of Dr. King and Joseph Lowery and Andy Young,' Carter said. For some, the Confederate flag has come to represent their history and southern . heritage. For others, it has come to represent one of the darkest, most . shameful periods in U.S. history, as it was the flag flown by the pro-slavery Confederate Army during the U.S. Civil War. Hate: Opponents of the flag say it represents racism and hate and has no business in contemporary Georgia . Carter's opponent, Republican Governor Nathan Deal, also says he wouldn't stop the state from issuing the plates. When asked in February whether he worried the issue might hurt Georgia's reputation, Deal told a local television station that he doesn't think it's something Georgians should be worrying about. 'Hopefully, those who take offense at it will look at the fact that it is a part of a cultural heritage of our state,' Deal said during an appearance on WXIA. Opponents of the plate are outraged that the state is sanctioning something that they believe represents racism and hate. No argument here: Georgia Governor Nathan Deal, Carter's opponent, also says he wouldn't do anything to block the plates . Democratic state Representative Tyrone Brooks successfully led the push to remove the Confederate battle emblem from the Georgia state flag more than a decade ago. He says that the Legislature probably couldn't do much to ban the license plates, noting that it likely could only write a law that would ban specialty plates altogether, not specifically banning the Sons of Confederate Veterans tag. However, he says, the plate is an administrative matter, and is something for the governor and Georgia Revenue Commissioner Douglas MacGinnitie would have to deal with. Brooks says he's urged them to consider doing away with the plates. 'If the American Nazi Party applied for one of those, would we grant one? Absolutely no,' Brooks told FirstCoastNews.com in February.","Jason Carter says people have the right to display specialty plates that feature the Confederate Flag .

"By . Taylor Auerbach . The mother of a 17-year-old New South Wales girl who is fighting for life in hospital after a devastating hit-and-run said her family is doing it 'very tough' as police hunt for the alleged offender. April-Lee Gillen, from Berkeley on the state's south coast, was admitted to hospital in a critical condition early on Sunday morning after suffering 'extensive head injuries' a police statement said. In what could be a chilling clue for investigators, she is believed to have posted the following status to her Facebook account shortly before the incident. Fighting for life: April-Lee Gillen, 17, is on life support after being hit by a car near her NSW home . Chilling: The teenager posted this potential clue minutes before she was found in a critical condition . 'Phones on 1 percent walking from warrawong to berks (Berkeley) and some Asian guy just stopped me telling me to come home with him cause it's safe and I need help wtf sos'. A screenshot of the cyber SOS was posted by Casey Louise, a friend of April-Lee's late on Monday night. April-Lee's mother Leonie told MailOnline she has not been able to bring herself to look at her daughter's Facebook account as her relatives maintain a bedside vigil at Wollongong hospital. 'I'm just trying to concentrate on April, I've just popped out to have a shower and then I'll be back,' she said from the family home. 'I'm just trying to keep my energy levels up, it's very tough.' Heartache: The family of April-Lee are doing it 'very tough', mother Leonie said . Asked how her daughter was faring in the critical 48 hours since the incident, Mrs Gillen said: 'nothing's changed'. According to police, a number of residents near Northcliffe Drive in Lake Heights - where April-Lee was hit - heard a 'loud noise' shortly before the critically injured teenager was found bloodied on the side of the road. Initial investigations suggested she was the victim of a hit and run. Terrified: The teenager posted a desperate call for help just minutes before being struck down . According to the Sydney Morning Herald, April's sister Kimberly wrote on Facebook: '(April is) in ICU on life support bleeding from her brain and not breathing on her own. 'She may of been abused or a hit and run between 12.30 and 1.30.' This afternoon, Kimberly wrote: 'I would like to thank everyone for their thoughts and prayers regarding April-Lee. I have been overwhelmed with inbox's and messages of support. I have been extremely busy and haven't had time to reply but I do appreciate it. Thankyou from the entire Gillen family, we are staying positive.' NSW police have urged anybody with information to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. Early this afternoon NSW police released another statement, announcing strike force Ketic had been set up to investigate the incident. In the statement, police appealed for any witnesses who saw April around 1am on Sunday to come forward. 'April is described as being of Caucasian appearance, with long dark hair and an average build. When found she was wearing a light-coloured pair of cargo pants, black shirt or blouse, khaki jacket and brown sandals, and she was carrying a black handbag,' police said. This morning Lake Illawarra inspector Steve Worthington told reporters: '(The Facebook message) is certainly vital information our detectives are following up, but until we can speak to April herself, we need further information from the public.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A model boat built by school children and launched off the coast of New Jersey in America survived an epic 14 months at sea before landing 3,000 miles away - in Guernsey. The 5ft vessel was constructed by pupils aged 11 and 12 for a class project on tides and released into the Atlantic in December 2012. The youngsters attached a photo of themselves and installed a tracking device so they could follow its progress across the ocean. Epic voyage: Paris Broe-Bougourd with the small boat named Crimson Tide which was launched in New Jersey in December 2012 before finding its way to Guernsey .

The GPS tracker had remained undamaged throughout the remarkable Atlantic crossing, allowing her excited pupils to watch its journey via a website . The hull was covered in barnacles, the mast had snapped and a waterproof capsule containing t-shirts and trinkets had been swept away - but the sturdy craft was still intact. Paris said: 'My friend, Luke Bentley, spotted it in the water. He thought it was debris I feel really good for finding it, it's something different - like a revolutionised message in a bottle. 'I am a carpenter by trade and will fix it up ASAP and as soon as the weather is calm will take it out and launch it. 'One of the students was also called Paris. It really is a one-in-a-million find.' As part of the project all the students involved signed their names on the vessel which was discovered covered in barnacles .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Hector Montoya saved his money for almost a year to buy a brand new PS4 gaming system. But after hearing a story about a mother and child dying in a fire because they didn't have a smoke detector he decided there were better investments. Instead of the PS4, the 9-year-old took his $300 and used it to buy smoke detectors for those in need. 'I decided saving a life was more important cause one life lost is too many,' he said. Hector Montoya decided to spend the money he'd saved for a PS4 on smoke detectors when he heard a tragic story about people who didn't have the devices . With the Grand Prairie Fire Department's help, Hector installed more than 100 smoke detectors around his Texas town. Most of those went into the homes of elderly residents or people who reminded him of the tragic story, CBS News reported. He credited his grandmother with the idea, as he was shocked to learn that there were people without safety systems in their homes. 'Really it just hurt my heart,' he told NBC DFW. Hector told reporters he'd simply start saving for the PS4 all over again. With the help of the local fire department, Montoya was able to install more than 100 smoke detectors in the homes of the poor and elderly .

These hilarious videos reveal terrified youngsters as they come face-to-face with the Easter Bunny as it arrives at their homes or parties to hand out chocolates. But instead of welcoming the fluffy friend, their screams and cries can be heard as they run for protection behind the nearest adult. Unhappy Easter: A little boy begins to cry as he's placed in front of the Easter Bunny for a picture . Too much: Eventually the young boy decides he's had enough and runs back to his parents . And it's little wonder, as some of the giant rabbits look pretty hare-raising. In one video, three young boys are posing in their smartest, matching clothes for a photographer - until a lurking bunny puts an end to the fun. Other footage shows complaining kids squirming in the laps of the Easter Bunny as he attempts to hold them to pose for pictures. And in other videos, as the Easter Bunny runs into a group of children, instead of running towards him to see what he is bringing, they run away - certain he's hatching a plan. Terrified: In another video, two young sisters begin crying at the mention of the East Bunny . Hitting back: A little girl lashes out at a toy bunny brought into her room by her parents . Horror: Another little boy cowers behind his parents for protection when he spots the giant rabbit .

"By . Daily Mail Repoter . Having made her name as a young and attractive starlet, you might expect Cameron Diaz to dread the ageing process. But the actress says she ‘can’t wait to be older’ as she believes women over 40 get the best parts. The 41-year-old says British stars Helen Mirren and Judi Dench and American Meryl Streep have demonstrated actresses become more successful as they age. Scroll down for video . Cameron Diaz has said woman are pressured into trying to 'defy nature' and look young, even as they get older . She said: ‘[This] is the best time of my life. I love being this age. I can’t wait to be older. The most interesting parts are for women who are over 40. We don’t see it that way, because they’re not the sexy parts. ‘We’re not giving those women enough credit for what they’re accomplishing, which is beautiful performances.’ Miss Diaz, who recently published The Body Book - a lifestyle guide aimed at helping women be more comfortable with their bodies - has previously said it's 'crazy' how women are pressured to look young, even as they are maturing. She said women 'don’t give ourselves permission to age gracefully’ and that they are constantly told they have to ‘defy nature’. The actress has previously given into this pressure, having botox treatment to try and remain fresh faced but afterwards spoke out about how it changed her face in a 'weird way' and that she regretted her decision. The Hollywood star held up Judi Dench, left, and Helen Mirren, right, as examples of inspiring older women . She has also been open about her long-term battle with acne and how she had plastic surgery on her nose after breaking it four times.

"By . Snejana Farberov . Hundreds of people armed with paddle boards gathered at Doheny State Beach, California, Friday to pay tribute to the late surfing and sailing legend Hobart 'Hobie' Alter. Alter, who helped popularize water sports with the development of the foam surfboard and the 'Hobie Cat' sailboat, passed away from cancer March 29 at his Palm Desert home. He was 80 years old. According to Alter's loved ones, he had always wanted to have a traditional Hawaiian paddle-out memorial, which is exactly what he got Friday at Dana Point. Scroll down for video . Hawaiian send-off: Hundreds of surfers and rowers gathered around a Hobie Cat catamaran, off the shore of Doheny State Beach, Calif., to celebrate the life of surf and sailing entrepreneur and pioneer Hobie Alter . Last wish: Before he passed away at age 80 last month, Alter said he wanted a traditional paddle-out memorial held . Pioneer: Hobart 'Hobie' Alter (center), pictured with his sisters Carolyn Wise (left) and Lillian Spencer (right) in December 2013, has died aged 80 . Surfers from all over the world floated flowers in the water and raised their paddles in the air to salute the late pioneer of their sport. His son, Hobie Jr, told CBS Los Angeles he never imagined so many people would come out to honor his father. Alter Sr's family released bowls filled with Hawaiian soil, sand, ocean water and salt representing purification, The Orange County Register reported. Hawaiian priest Eric Keawe performed a prayer song as swarms of surfers in bright wetsuits floated in the clear blue water Friday evening. Hobie Cat catamarans festooned with . multi-colored sails were scattered around the beach, while the first . surfboard ever made by Alter was on display at the Surfing Heritage . Foundation booth nearby. Fitting tribute: Surfers from all over the world floated flowers in the water and raised their paddles in the air to salute their hero . Wide following: People from all over the world came out to California to take part in the floating tribute . Relic: The first surfboard ever made by Alter was on display at the Surfing Heritage Foundation booth . ‘It . was so much fun and such a great send off for Hobie. He’s such a great . inspiration for all of us,’ former employee Mike Ester said. A true ocean lover, Alter was a champion surfer who conquered the Makaha International Surf Contest in 1958 and 1959, and won a trio of tandem surfing championships from 1961-’63. But Alter’s legacy will always be as surfboard and sailboat production pioneer. He was dubbed 'the Henry Ford of the surfboard industry' by Steve Pezman for his contribution to the large-scale manufacture of surfboards. The self-taught innovator and surfer . had his start in the early 1950s carving wooden surfboards in the garage . of his family's Laguna Beach home. When . the balsa wood used for the boards became scarce, he and his friend . Gordon 'Grubby' Clark created surfboards out of polyurethane foam. Champion: Hobie Alter (pictured) was a champion surfer before he went on to create foam surfboards, becoming the face of California's surfing culture . Heyday: Hobie Alter pictured in a long-sleeve white sweatshirt at Doheny Contest in 1963 . Where it all began: Hobie Alter opened his first retail shop in Dana Point, California (pictured) in 1954 and revolutionized surfing with his foam boards. An original Hobie long board is pictured . The . boards were durable, but had better flexibility and were less expensive . than wooden boards. The invention revolutionized surfing, and Hobie . became a top surfboard brand. Clark went on to launch Clark Foam, which . had a virtual monopoly on the unshaped foam blocks that were used for . custom-made boards. In the late 60s, Alter turned his focus to sailing and designed a lightweight sailboat inspired by the twin-hulled Polynesian catamaran. The more affordable Hobie Cat, which could be launched from the beach, is credited with bringing high-performance sailing to the masses. For his contribution to the sport, Alter was inducted into the National Sailing Hall of Fame in 2011. He was survived by his wife, Susan, a daughter and two sons.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . This silver pocket watch saved the life of a World War One soldier fighting for Britain on the Somme - by stopping a German bullet from piercing his chest. The two-inch timepiece was unearthed by the family of Corporal Walter Davis, who served on the Western Front in France when he was just 22 years old. The soldier joined the 9th Battalion North Staffordshire Regiment in 1915 - and was sent straight to the front line, where he battled German forces during the Battle of the Somme. Scroll down for video . Relatives: The story of Cpl Davis's close encounter was passed down his family for generations, but the watch was only recently unearthed by his granddaughter Linda Ward. Above, Ms Ward with her daughter Louise, 23 . Miracle: This silver pocket watch saved the life of a World War One soldier fighting for Britain on the Somme . Saved: The timepiece stopped this German bullet (right) from piercing the chest of Corporal Walter Davis (left) During the fierce conflict, Cpl Davis and his platoon came under heavy fire from the trenches - and a bullet was shot directly at his chest. But thanks to the solid silver watch, the soldier incredibly survived. Despite the story of his miracle escape being passed down his family for generations, the damaged watch was only recently uncovered by his granddaughter Linda Ward - 50 years later. Soldier: Cpl Davis, pictured at an older age,  joined the 9th Battalion North Staffordshire Regiment in 1915 . Ms Ward, 59, from Telford, Shropshire, discovered the timepiece in her late father's dusty attic, along with the metal bullet and Cpl Davis's diary documenting his time at war. 'I was told about it by my dad when I was 15 and he showed me the watch and his diary that he kept,' she said. 'My grandad died when I was 12 so I remember him but he never talked about the war. My dad died in 2006 and he had the watch and diary but you know how it is when someone dies, it takes a while to go through everything. 'I think we started looking at the belongings about a year ago and uncovered the diary. I was stunned, I had seen it when I was a little but only a couple of times as it is so special. I had pretty much forgotten about it. 'He was hit in the chest when he was in the trenches, the soldier next to him was shot in the head and died. It has become a bit of a family legend but no one has ever known the exact details - he took that to his grave.' Cpl Davis's fascinating short diary - which has no dates or locations - documents the horror of what he saw on a daily basis during the conflict. In it, the soldier wrote: 'My thoughts are that I shall never see England again. One of these days I shall get it, but I am more used to it now and I don't care what comes. 'If I am to die here, I shall, and if not here then somewhere else, for they are all going a few at a time.' In the Soldier's Small Book, a type of diary issued by the Army to all service men, Cpl Davis does not mention being hit by the bullet. However, he does record a number of other experiences - including how close he came to death on several occasions. He wrote: 'I had some very near shaves myself. I have twice been smothered with earth and once while building up a parapet I had to lie flat on my stomach so as to render the brother Boche from seeing me.

Had it exploded there would have no more of me, I should have been in bits. 'It was often such things as these that I have always thought of home, how I longed for it to be all over.' He added: 'Our first casualties occurred when we were digging a trench 200 yards of the Boche front line when we lost about six wounded. 'A few days later I lost one of my best men in the section, poor Jim Ford, a good living man and always a willing worker.

Formed as a . service battalion in Lichfield in September 1914, the 9th Battalion was . heavily involved in the First World War. It moved to Hastings in December 1914, before becoming a pioneer battalion in 1915. For the next three years, it fought German troops in France during the Battle of the Somme. Despite Cpl Davis's dedication to his platoon, he was forced to return home 12 months later after badly injuring his leg. The soldier was shot as he was leading his platoon into No Man's Land at 3.15am during the fierce battle. In . his diary, he wrote: 'Nothing doing much until we get to the Somme. No . one knew where we were going to, all as we knew it might be our resting . place. 'We knew it was hell we were going because we were told we had got to shift the Boche out of it. 'We . shifted him right enough, but, oh the awful mess, nothing but corpses . everywhere. I put my foot on a poor chap, but could not help it, there . were so many. 'We . lost a terrible lot of men and so did a good many regiments, but I kept . on coming through. I was now in charge of the platoon. 'We are going over again this morning at 3.15 and something is going to happen.' His last entry reads: 'I am not in hospital having got wounded in the leg going over the third line of the Boche.

"By . Alastair Glennie . Veteran actor Sir Michael Gambon wears an earpiece while acting in case he forgets his lines. The 73-year-old, who is best known for playing Albus Dumbledore in the Harry Potter films, said that he has had himself checked by two doctors for Alzheimer’s disease because he is so worried by his memory loss. He said: ‘The good news is that that’s not the case. Fearful: Michael Gambon wears an earpiece on stage in case he forgets his lines . ‘It’s a real worry but there’s not much I can do about it.’ Gambon revealed the secret of his earpiece to an audience at the HighTide festival in Halesworth, Suffolk, adding: ‘A girl speaks into it to give me my lines.’ The Irish-born actor – who began his stage career with minor Shakespearean roles alongside Lord Olivier – confessed that it was his ‘overwhelming fear’ of forgetting his words on stage that forced him to pull out of a 2009 National Theatre production of The Habit of Art by Alan Bennett. At the time, it was simply announced he had pulled out because of ‘ill health’. Richard Griffiths, who had starred in Bennett’s 2004 play The History Boys, replaced him. Michael Gambon was forced to pull out of a 2009 National Theatre production of The Habit of Art by Alan Bennett. He was replaced by Richard Griffiths (pictured), who had starred in Bennett's 2004 play The History Boys . Gambon said that he now believes the only roles he can play on stage are those with few lines, such as butlers. He added: ‘You know, the sort of part where he comes on and says a few words. ‘A role that’s played for laughs – like when the phone goes, he doesn’t know where it is.’ The actor revealed that he was recently approached by the director Sir Trevor Nunn, adding: ‘He said he’d got a part for me in a play. I asked him if it was a butler. He said no. ‘I then said, “Well, a part that’s like a butler?”’ Next month, Gambon will perform in a Berlin production of Samuel Beckett’s play Eh Joe. He said: ‘The great thing is that it’s a silent part with no words. I just sit still, facing a camera, with all of the emotions of my face projected. ‘After half an hour I have to cry.’ His next television role will be in a BBC One drama called Common in June. Gambon became well known in 1986 when he starred in BBC crime drama The Singing Detective. He took over the part of Hogwarts headmaster Dumbledore in the third Harry Potter film after Richard Harris died in 2002, aged 72. He said: ‘Richard Harris had just died and they approached me and I decided to play it with a posh Irish accent, rather like Harris.

He said: ‘I’ve had a private pilot’s licence for years and flown all round the UK and over to France.’ However he said he is now limited to doing ‘circuits and bumps’ around airfields. Finally, Gambon spoke about the famous directors he has worked with, adding: ‘Harold Pinter would shout at me, though less than at the other actors. ‘He also told me off for what he said was behaving like a ballet dancer.’","Irish-born actor, 73, pulled out of Alan Bennett play in 2009 over fear of forgetting his words .

"By . Associated Press . A couple who held hands at breakfast every morning even after 70 years of marriage have died 15 hours apart. Helen Felumlee, of Nashport, died at 92 on April 12. Her husband, 91-year-old Kenneth Felumlee, died the next morning. The couple's eight children say the two had been inseparable since meeting as teenagers, once sharing the bottom of a bunk bed on a ferry rather than sleeping one night apart, the Zanesville Times Recorder reported. In this picture taken in September 1941, Kenneth and Helen Felumlee pose nearly three years before their marriage in February 1944 . The Felumlees, who celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary in February, died 15 hours apart from each other last week . They remained deeply in love until the very end, even eating breakfast together while holding hands, said their daughter, Linda Cody. 'We knew when one went, the other was going to go,' she said. According to Cody, about 12 hours after Helen died, Kenneth looked at his children and said, 'Mom's dead.' He quickly began to fade and was surrounded by 24 of his closest family members and friends when he died the next morning. 'He was ready,' Cody said. 'He just didn't want to leave her here by herself.' The couple remained deeply in love until the very end, even eating breakfast together while holding hands . The pair had known each other for several years when they eloped in Newport, Ky., across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, on Feb. 20, 1944. At two days shy of his 21st birthday, Kenneth was too young to marry in Ohio. 'He couldn't wait,' son Jim Felumlee said. Kenneth worked as a railroad car inspector and mechanic before becoming a mail carrier for the Nashport Post Office. He was active in his Nashport-Irville United Methodist Church as a Sunday school teacher. Helen stayed at home, not only cooking and cleaning for her own family but also for other families in need in the area. Kenneth and Helen pose in their later years, surrounded by their eight children . She taught Sunday school, too, but was known more for her greeting card ministry, sending cards for birthdays, sympathy and the holidays to everyone in her community, each with a personal note inside. 'She kept Hallmark in business,' daughter-in-law Debbie Felumlee joked. When Kenneth retired in 1983 and the children began to leave the house, the Felumlees began to explore their love of travel, visiting almost all 50 states by bus. 'He didn't want to fly anywhere because you couldn't see anything as you were going,' Jim Felumlee said. Although both experienced declining health in recent years, Cody said, each tried to stay strong for the other. 'That's what kept them going,' she said.","Helen and Kenneth Felumlee wed in 1944 .

"By . Becky Barrow . and James Coney . Invasive probes into borrowers' finances and a potential end to short-term mortgage deals has been ordered by the Financial Conduct Authority, its head Martin Wheatley pictured . A massive crackdown on mortgages will come into force next week, with borrowers facing a forensic probe into their personal finances. Cheap, short-term, fixed-rate deals could also be scrapped in a bid to ensure the irresponsible lending that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis is not repeated. The reforms, ordered by the Financial Conduct Authority, are expected to slow the growth in property prices at a time when experts believe the market is in danger of overheating. Traditionally, people applying for a mortgage are asked for three months’ pay slips and recent bank statements. But from Saturday they will  face ‘invasive’ questions about their finances and lifestyle, warned Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the FCA – from their weekly food bill to the cost of their childcare arrangements and even how much they spend on gym membership. The rules, which will hit everyone from first-time buyers to homeowners looking for a new loan, are likely to mean: . Speaking exclusively to the Daily Mail, Mr Wheatley admitted the changes  would create some problems in the short term. ‘In reality is it going to be perfect on day one? Probably not,’ he said. He added that while the new rules would deliver some benefits, there would also be ‘some things that we are going to have to think again about’. Those wanting to move or remortgage in a hurry could face a much longer mortgage application process. The action will see a rapid slowdown in house price growth as mortgages become harder to get and take longer to be agreed (library image) And families could miss out on buying . their dream home as they wait for an interview slot with their lender. The interviews themselves could last up to three hours. Asked if people were ready, or even aware of the changes, Mr Wheatley said: ‘If I’m honest, no.’ The . reforms mean nobody will be allowed a mortgage unless the lender . decides they will be able to afford it, even if interest rates rise . sharply. At present, nine in ten mortgage borrowers opt for a fixed-rate arrangement, such as a two-year fixed deal. From next week, such deals will be much harder to find. Mr Wheatley said the changes were likely to mean fewer ‘teaser’ rates. For example, a family might be able to afford a mortgage when they are paying a rock-bottom, fixed rate of two per cent interest. But their loan becomes unaffordable when this deal ends, unless they can find another deal at an equally cheap rate, which might not always be possible. Mr Wheatley said: ‘We have some concerns about those short-term teaser rates that suck people into something.  The question is: “Can you afford whatever it resets to at the end of that rate?” Interest-only mortgages will virtually disappear under the new rules. The FCA head predicted there would be problems with the reforms in the short term . Lenders will have to ‘stress test’ all loans to check the borrower could still afford them if interest rates hit seven per cent. At present, the average two-year fixed rate mortgage charges 2.37 per cent. For a family with a £100,000 loan, this means monthly repayments of £442. If the rate was seven per cent, the monthly bill would balloon to £707, an increase of £265 a month or nearly 60 per cent. Mr Wheatley said the changes could affect house prices, which are currently rising by around ten per cent a year. The FCA’s own analysis found if prices were set to rise by 34 per cent over the next eight years, the rate of growth would fall to 23 per cent as a result of the changes. Cheaper interest-only mortgage deals, which allow people to pay only the interest on their loan and none of the capital, will virtually disappear. Mr Wheatley admitted the rules, known as the Mortgage Market Review, mean these deals will become ‘a niche’. Ray Boulger, senior technical manager of mortgage advisers John Charcol, said many of the questions lenders were being forced to ask were ‘just ridiculous’. He said: ‘If the new rules were applied to car insurance, nobody under the age of 25 would be able to drive a car because they would be deemed too risky.’ Mr Boulger warned the new rules were ‘too black and white’ and had been designed for the ‘lowest common denominator’.","Short-term, fixed-rate deals could be scrapped in latest reforms .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Romanian Britain's Got Talent act who dazzled David Walliams last week allegedly owes £25,000 to a Eurovision singer for claiming they had a homosexual affair. Semi-finalist Cristian Grigore Spiridon, 35, ended up in a Romanian civil court three years ago after he made false sex claims about Mihai Traistariu. The singer, who controversially won David Walliams' Golden Buzzer pass on Saturday, made the claims in a local newspaper in his home country. Claims: A Eurovision singer claims he successfully sued Britain's Got Talent act Cristian Grigore Spiridon (pictured) for £25,000 three years ago for claiming they had an affair . Semi-finalist: On Saturday, the Romanian singer won over David Walliams, who used his Golden Buzzer to put him through to the next round . A friend said: 'He admits he did it and now regrets his actions. As far as owing money, he says it's up to the newspaper to pay.' According to the Daily Star, outraged Mihai, 34, denied he was gay and successfully sued Cristian, but never received the money. Eurovision singer Mihai, who represented Romania in 2006, claims Cristian 'vanished' shortly after the civil case in 2011. He told the Daily Star: 'He is a stupid, crazy ""singer"" who made my life hell. 'He told a big newspaper here he had a love story with me. I am not gay. 'I went to court and he had to pay me £25,000. But I never got it.' Cristian progressed to the semi-finals last weekend after a fiery cover of Sex Bomb by Sir Tom Jones. 'Outraged': Mihai Traistariu, 34, (left) claims they only encountered each other once at an event but did not speak. Friends of Cristian claim he was provoked by the local newspaper, Cancan, to make the allegation . Despite . damning criticism from Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon and Simon Cowell - . who branded Cristian a 'joke' - comedian David Walliams praised the . performance, and put him through. Mihai – a major star in Romania – said he was 'shocked' to read in the local newspaper, Cancan, that Cristian had claimed he was gay, as he says they met just once at a concert with 10 other performers. He added: 'I never even said hello to him so I was shocked when he gave a newspaper story about me.' Millions of viewers watched as Cristian . came one step closer to performing for the Queen at the Royal Variety Performance, despite failing to impress three of the judges. Wannabe: Last year, Cristian appeared on The X Factor while wearing a pair of red underpants and no trousers, but he failed to impress the judges . Talent show star: Cristian previously appeared on Romania's Got Talent . His rendition of Sex Bomb, which Simon Cowell branded 'an appalling joke', came a year after his failed X Factor audition. Wearing a pair of red underpants - and no trousers - Cristian sang Kylie Minogue's I Can't Get You Out Of My Head, and told judges he was already 'famous' in his native country. But the panel was not impressed, and he was sent off. MailOnline has contacted Britain's Got Talent for comment.","Cristian Grigore Spiridon, 35, put through to BGT semi-finals on Saturday .

"By . Paul Bentley . After ten disastrous months as Manchester United manager, David Moyes was on the verge of the sack last night. The 50-year-old Scot was said to have been summoned to an urgent meeting by the club’s owners, who have apparently lost patience with his performance. However humiliating, Moyes’s exit will be exceptionally lucrative. Heading for the exit? Manager David Moyes and his wife Pamela, pictured on Sunday as he faced the sack . He is on £5million a year, including bonuses, with another five years left to run on his contract. His payout could be as high as £10million. He was handpicked for the job by his predecessor, Alex Ferguson, whose success made United one of the biggest brands in world sport and secured a stock market listing in New York. But that status has been put at threat by atrocious results under Moyes and social networking sites were quickly ablaze with rumours of his likely departure yesterday. No official comment was made on the situation, leaving shocked fans and investors in the dark. The club’s share price dipped by 1.2 per cent. It is possible that an official statement was being delayed because stock market rules strictly govern announcements that can affect share prices. Lucrative: He is on £5million a year, including bonuses, with another five years left to run on his contract . Despite being hand-picked by his predecessor, Moyes has been marred by atrocious results this season . Last night, the share price for Manchester United dipped by 1.2 per cent as his future hung precariously . Reacting to developments, United fan and . broadcaster Eamonn Holmes said on Twitter: ‘I’m sure David Moyes is a . nice man, but he just didn’t understand our team and our players didn’t . understand him. This is the right thing.’ Writer Toby Young joked: ‘Maybe David Moyes can get a job with Ukip. He’s proved himself very good at staying out of Europe.’ And broadcaster Jeremy Vine added: . ‘Please Manchester United, in the name of good sense and decency, do not . sack David Moyes. Signed fans of Chelsea, ManCity and Liverpool.’ Rare . support came from tycoon Lord Sugar who said: ‘He needs another season.’ It . is thought Moyes was called in for talks with chief executive Ed . Woodward and the Glazers, the US family that controls the club. Fans dubbed Moyes 'The Chosen One' as Sir Alex implored them to get behind him, citing his excellent record . He is expected to be dismissed within 48 . hours with lifelong United player Ryan Giggs set to step in until a new . manager is appointed. Speculation that Sir Alex could return to the helm . is believed to be misplaced, with Dutchman Louis van Gaal an early . favourite. The son of a football scout and pattern maker, Moyes grew up in the working-class Thornwood district of Glasgow. Moyes, 50, and Pamela live in a secluded house in Lancashire with their son David Jnr and daughter Lauren . After playing football in the lower . leagues, he started his managerial career at unfashionable Preston, on a . salary of about £50,000 a year. He had broad success in 11 seasons at top-flight Everton before signing for United last May and starting work on July 1. Because of his backing from Sir Alex, fans dubbed Moyes ‘The Chosen One’ but disillusion soon set in on the Old Trafford terraces. An alarming decline has seen United collapse from champions to seventh in the Premier League table. They will end the season with their lowest points total since the Premier League was established in 1992. Moyes, who is a practising Christian and Labour Party supporter, may be able to keep his United salary until he finds a new position. It is possible however that the club has written an under-performance clause into his contract that would allow for a quick pay-off. The length of Moyes’s contract was approved by Sir Alex who, having suffered a torrid start at United himself, wanted his successor to have extended job security. Moyes and his wife Pamela live in a secluded house in Lancashire with their son David Jnr, who is a football agent, and daughter Lauren, who has been in the spotlight after falsely being accused of having an affair with a United player. Moyes’s father and his mother-in-law also live in the grounds of the family home. Moyes has told how he was out shopping with his wife when Sir Alex called to offer him his job. He said: ‘I had my jeans on and my T-shirt. I had to drop my wife at the shopping centre and I’m saying to myself I’d never ever go to a meeting with Sir Alex with a pair of jeans on.’ Moyes and his wife met at a Scottish hotel two decades ago. Of that first encounter, he has said: ‘She saw me once, and, well, that was it.’","50-year-old earns £5m a year plus bonuses, has 5 years left on contract .

"By . Tamara Cohen . Ed Miliband did not disown previous comments that it is 'socially unacceptable' to oppose windfarms . Britain will have to ‘embrace’ onshore wind farms if Labour wins the next election, Ed Miliband has said. While David Cameron has called for a cap on new turbines in favour of building them offshore, Mr Miliband has defended the need for windmills in the countryside. The Labour leader said residents ‘have the right to make their objections’ to applications in their area, but turbines must be built in places which can best generate electricity. Mr Miliband did not disown comments he made as Energy Secretary in 2009, when he said opposing wind farms was as ‘socially unacceptable’ as not wearing a seat belt or failing to stop at a zebra crossing. The remarks infuriated rural campaigners who warned that vast swathes of Britain’s most beautiful countryside could be blighted against the wishes of residents. Mr Miliband told the Mail that Labour’s next manifesto would include ‘commitments’ on green energy, and suggested commissioning a map of Britain to work out where the wind was strongest. ‘I understand the reasons why people worry about wind turbines in particular places,’ he said. ‘People always have to have the right to make their objections – planning issues and so on. ‘I do think personally that we have got to embrace in general both offshore and onshore wind farms situated in the right way.’ While Labour is arguing for more onshore wind farms, the Tories have pledged to limit them to off-shore sites by 2020 . In an interview he drew a clear dividing line with the Conservatives, who have signalled that their manifesto will contain a pledge to limit windmills onshore from 2020. There are about 4,000 turbines on land in Britain, and another 3,000 either under construction or which have planning permission. More than 100 Tory MPs have expressed opposition due to their impact on the landscape and the subsidies they rake in for landowners, paid for on domestic energy bills. But Mr Miliband suggested opposition to turbines onshore could be reduced if they were built in the windiest places. ‘One of the things people raise is not just, “We don’t like it here”, but “Is it going to make that much of a difference here because we don’t have enough wind?”,’ he said. Conservative politician John Hayes has called for the building of onshore wind farms to be stopped entirely . John Hayes, the former Conservative energy minister who now works in Downing Street, has spoken out about too many wind farms ‘peppering’ the country, and called for a halt to new applications. Mr Miliband said: ‘It’s got to be done in a sensitive way, but I don’t think we should take the John Hayes position, and say no more onshore wind. ‘We will have manifesto commitments on green energy, definitely, because we think green energy is really important for the country.’ The Campaign to Protect Rural England warned that Labour risked alienating the public. A spokesman said: ‘If you carry on trying to ram onshore wind turbines down people’s throats you are going to turn people against the bigger things we need to do to combat climate change. Ed Miliband needs to be really careful not to alienate people and to make sure he listens to their concerns.’ The position is another area of agreement between Labour and the green-minded Liberal Democrats, who also favour onshore wind. In a Coalition row earlier this month, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is reported to have angrily rebuffed an attempt by David Cameron and George Osborne to cap new wind farm applications straight away. While Mr Cameron’s party favours putting more turbines at sea, Britain’s 1,000 offshore windmills are considerably more expensive to build and maintain, and attract higher subsidies. Ed Miliband's wife will benefit from his plans to ‘embrace’ onshore wind farms if Labour gains power. Justine Thornton is a barrister who specialises in environmental law and has helped developers in high-profile legal battles to build turbines. The 43-year-old junior barrister at leading London chambers Thirty Nine Essex Street is described on her online CV as ‘highly recommended for her environmental expertise’, and she has worked on many planning disputes. Her clients have included the Department for Communities and Local Government, which she has represented in planning cases, EDF Energy, Defra, the Environment Agency, the Welsh Assembly and councils. She recently advised Barnwell Manor Wind Energy in its unsuccessful bid to build four 400ft turbines on land owned by the Duke of Gloucester. The plan was rejected by the High Court on the grounds it would overshadow a Tudor summer house set in what a planning inspector called Britain’s finest Elizabethan garden, with ‘national if not international significance’. Miss Thornton subsequently co-authored an essay on the case, entitled ‘Turbines, heritage assets and merits: a change in the wind’. Her work as a lawyer has previously caused controversy for Mr Miliband. Five years ago she had to be barred from working for German energy conglomerate E.On, which was bidding to build power stations in Britain when her then boyfriend was Climate Change Secretary. Whitehall mandarins ordered the move to avoid any accusations of a potential conflict of interest.","Miliband previously branded opposing wind farms 'socially unacceptable'

"By . Becky Barrow . Dubious value: Many couples buy a baby sling and never actually use it . Couples spend £1,600 preparing for their first baby – but many of their purchases are never used. The most common items that new parents regret buying are baby slings, Moses baskets and specialised mum-to-be toiletries, a poll has found. The cost of preparing for the arrival of a first baby has jumped by 17 per cent since 2012, when the poll was first carried out. Then, couples typically spent £1,398. And there is further financial pressure on new parents as many also find it necessary to upgrade their home and car at the same time. One in five move to a bigger property, typically from a flat to a house, according to the poll of 2,000 parents with children under five, carried out by insurance firm Aviva. On average, they spent around £40,000 on the move, although one in seven movers spent 'more than £150,000 to upsize' their home, typically from a flat to a small house. Many couples leave the move to the last minute, enduring a stressful period of trying to buy a new home and decorate it as the baby's due date approaches. More than a quarter of new parents also either bought a car, or changed their existing car, before their baby arrived. On average, they spent £5,298, which is more than three times the average monthly take-home pay. The average full-time worker earns £27,000 and gets a salary of £1,708 a month after paying their tax bill. Louise Colley, a director of Aviva and a mother of six-year-old twins, said 'It is only natural that people want to give their baby the best of everything, particularly when they're about to become parents for the first time. 'It is also interesting that most new parents admit they've spent money on items they didn't need or never used.' The amount of money spent by parents has jumped by 17 per cent since Aviva did the same poll two years in 2012 when new parents typically spent £1,398. Pointless? Moses baskets scored highly on the list of baby gear parents regret buying . Of the £1,619 now spent by new parents before their first baby arrives, the most expensive item was a pram or pushchair, typically costing £225. This is followed by £160 on furniture for the nursery, such as a nappy changing table, £152 on a cot and a mattress for it, and £143 on baby clothes. Other items include a car seat (£89), maternity clothes (£119), baby toys (£131) and a nursing chair used while breastfeeding or bottle feeding the baby (£106). While a third install a smoke alarm, more than half install stair gates to stop their children falling down the stairs and 40 per cent put safety catches on their kitchen cupboards, the majority have no life insurance. Overall, the Aviva study estimates parents spend a total of nearly £500million a year getting ready for their first baby's arrival. Official figures show around 800,000 babies are born each year in the UK. Of the total, nearly four in ten are born to first-time mothers. The poll is based on interviews, which took place this month, with 2,000 parents who have children under the age of five.","New poll reveals items parents buy before first baby - and what they regret .

"By . Jason Groves . New figures will reignite debates within the Tory party about their treatment of the squeezed middle . The number of Britons paying the 40p tax rate has risen by almost 400 per cent in 30 years. This year 4.4million will pay higher-rate income tax compared with just 930,000 in 1984. More than a million people have been dragged into the tax band since the Coalition took power. An official report blamed the Government’s policy of lowering the threshold at which workers start paying the 40p rate, to pay for an increase in the personal allowance to help those on low incomes. George Osborne did increase the threshold in this year’s Budget – but by just 1 per cent, below the rate of inflation. The latest changes mean the income at which we pay the 40p tax rate has fallen from £43,875 at the time of the last election to £41,865 today. The report from the House of Commons library said the threshold would be almost £50,000 if it had kept pace with the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation since 2010. The figures will reignite the debate within the Conservative Party over the decision to focus tax cuts on the low-paid while ignoring the squeezed middle classes. Tory MPs are pushing for a clear commitment to address the 40p tax rate in the party’s next manifesto. Former minister John Redwood said: ‘The 40p rate kicks in at too low a level – that is becoming increasingly clear. ‘The original idea was to catch people on earnings that were way above the average. ‘Now it’s catching people who are struggling to pay  a mortgage. ‘I think the  Conservative Party will want to be seen as a party that  does not penalise people  who work hard and want to  be successful, and that does mean taking action on  his issue.’ Thirty years ago, when higher-rate tax was levied at between 40 and 60 per cent depending on income, it was paid by 930,000 – fewer than 4 per cent of taxpayers. George Osborne did raise the threshold - by one per cent, which is less than the rate of inflation . Nigel Lawson cut the top rate to a flat 40 per cent in 1988. In its first full year, the rate was paid by 1.56million, or 6 per cent of taxpayers. Yet by the turn of the century, the number paying the top rate had risen to 2.5million, or 9 per cent of workers. The figure now stands at a 4.4million, with a further 313,000 paying the top rate of 45p. The Commons report said: ‘The number of taxpayers paying the additional or higher rates of tax remain a minority – around 16 per cent. However, this group pays a very large share of the total amount paid.’ It cited HMRC figures showing the top 10 per cent of taxpayers – or 5 per cent of adults – now account for 59 per cent of total income  tax contributions.","More than a million people have been pulled into tax band since 2010 .

Although the difference between the two is usually based on height, the actual definition is in fact based on phenotypes - the physical characteristics and temperament of the animal. In short, despite being smaller than many ponies, the character and physicality of an Argentinian Falabella has far more in common with a horse, and they are therefore defined as such. Because they are so small, Argentinian Falabellas are not suitable for riding. They are, however, highly intelligent and are occasionally used as an alternative to a guide dog for blind people.","Argentinian Falabella 'Sammy' is too small to travel in a normal horse box .

"By . Sophie Borland . Thousands of women in their forties will be offered statins under new guidelines drawn up by heart experts. Middle-aged adults with unhealthy lifestyles will be routinely prescribed the drugs to prevent heart attacks and strokes in 20 years’ time. Statins are usually given only to patients with heart disease, or those very likely to develop it within ten years, based on their family history or unhealthy lifestyle. They cost only 10p a day and are mainly taken by the over-65s. Preventative: Statins are usually given only to patients at great risk of heart attacks, but new guidance may change this . But guidance drawn up by charities including the British Heart Foundation and the Stroke Association advises treating anyone at high risk of having a stroke or heart attack any time in their lives. It is based on a computer calculator which works out patients’ lifetime risk of heart disease based on their family history, blood pressure, cholesterol, whether they smoke, where they live, ethnicity and age. The advice will mean younger patients in their forties and fifties – and in some cases thirties – with a high lifetime risk are now deemed eligible. Crucially, it will lead to more women being offered the drugs. They tend to develop heart disease on average ten years later than men, which means they are not usually deemed to be at high risk under the current advice. Risk: Experts have said that prescribing the drug earlier can bring greater benefits over a lifetime . Around 7million Britons take statins, which work by lowering cholesterol and preventing fatty deposits building up in the arteries. Experts cannot say how many more will be offered the drugs as a result of these new guidelines but they will become commonly taken among younger age groups. The guidance was published by the Joint British Societies - which include the British Heart Foundation, the Stroke Association, Heart UK and Diabetes UK - after concerns of rising levels of obesity and heart disease. It will be used by GPs carrying out health MoTs, the five-yearly NHS checks offered to all patients aged 40 to 70. Professor Peter Weissberg, medical director of the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘If you take a woman, let’s say in her early forties, with stonkingly high cholesterol, very high blood pressure and who smokes, her ten-year risk is still fairly low. But her lifetime risk is huge. ‘People need to start changing their lifestyles at a much earlier age. If you wait until your fifties and sixties, it’s too late.’ Professor Sir Rory Collins, of Oxford University, who has carried out extensive research on statins, said: ‘The difference with these guidelines is they are saying that although risk is lower at younger ages, your potential benefit over the long term is greater.’ Sir Rory recently said patients were unnecessarily dying from heart attacks because doctors were overly cautious about prescribing statins. Side-effects include nausea, cataracts and, most seriously, myopathy, a condition leading to muscle pain and potential fatal liver failure. NICE, the NHS medicines regulator, is due to publish its own guidelines on statins this summer but they will take into account this new advice from heart experts.","Middle-aged adults will receive drugs to prevent problems in decades' time .

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov says the four parties gathered Thursday in Geneva - the U.S., European Union, Ukraine and Russia - will work to establish a broad national dialogue to ensure that people's rights are protected. He said that amnesty will be given to pro-Russian protesters who participated in an uprising against the government in Kiev, except those found guilty of capital crimes. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (left) shakes hands with Russian Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Lavrov says the two nations and other parties will work to ease tensions in Ukraine . The tentative agreement could put on hold - for now at least - economic sanctions the West had prepared to impose on Russia if the talks were fruitless. And that would ease international pressure both on Moscow and nervous European Union nations that depend on Russia for their energy. The news came as the U.S. announced it will send medical supplies, helmets and other non-lethal aid to the Ukrainian military in response to Russia's 'dangerously irresponsible' efforts to destabilise the country. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel today told a Pentagon news conference that he telephoned Ukraine's acting defense minister to tell him that President Barack Obama had approved the assistance, which does not include weapons.

Speaking alongside his Polish counterpart, Tomasz Siemoniak, Hagel said the U.S. and its NATO allies have to consider the possibility that Russia's actions in Ukraine point to a broader campaign to retake territories of the former Soviet Union. 'I think we have to be alert to all possibilities,' Hagel said. The actions of the Russians over the last two months are not only irresponsible and violate 'territorial integrity and sovereignty of sovereign nation, but it's dangerously irresponsible'. He said the 28-nation NATO alliance, of which Ukraine is not a member, has to 'think through what are the possibilities, what could happen' after the Ukraine crisis is over. 'So, yes, we have to look at, based on past actions, we have to look at every possibility.' A Ukrainian soldier at a road block on the outskirts of Izyum, Eastern Ukraine .

Siemoniak said his government is deeply concerned by Russian actions in Ukraine and what they might portend for other countries formerly in the Soviet orbit. He called Ukraine: 'a situation where in the name of the protection of unthreatened interests of the rights of the minority, a brutal intervention is taking place.' Hagel said he and Siemoniak discussed a 'solidarity and partnership roadmap' for closer U.S.-Polish defense ties. He said they identified new areas of military-to-military cooperation, including special operations forces, air forces and additional military exercises and training. Hagel said they agreed to invite other NATO member countries, including Romania, to contribute to a U.S.-Polish aviation detachment that currently includes a dozen U.S. F-16 fighter jets that operates from a Polish air base. 'This regionalised approach will help strengthen both Poland and its neighbors,' Hagel said.","Russian minister says U.S, EU, Ukraine and Russia reached consensus .

"By . Andrew Levy . Amba, one of the park's tigers . Easter egg hunters feared they had become the hunted after a ‘tiger escape’ alarm went off at a zoo. Hundreds of people were ordered indoors as staff reacted to a ‘code red’ at Shepreth Wildlife Park in Cambridgeshire. Lunches were left on picnic benches and an Easter egg hunt was abandoned as efforts were made to locate the most dangerous cats - two tigers and a puma. But it soon became clear that it was a false alarm and around 500 adults and children were able to go back to enjoying their day out. Curator Rebecca Willers said it became clear ‘within minutes’ that there was no risk to visitors on Saturday. ‘The “code red” alarm set off by a member of the public means there are tigers out there and the whole park had to be evacuated,’ she said. ‘They were either testing us to see how we would do or did it as a practical joke. ‘It was not done by accident. The button has a flap over it, so it was deliberate. But we did not catch the culprit. ‘It happened at the busiest point of the day, just after midday when we had started the Easter egg hunt. ‘We’ve had three alarms go off that weren’t drills, which is not too bad considering that’s since 2001. ‘We do drills four times a year but we weren’t scheduled to have one so all the staff treated it as if it was a real incident. ‘Everyone in the park had to go into buildings. I was really impressed with the staff. ‘The public did superbly, although a few didn’t want to leave their picnics.’ She later explained the three previous alarms were not for genuine escapes but the result of mistakes by visitors. There are three alarm buttons at the park, pictured, and one was set off deliberately by a member of the public. The culprit has not been apprehended . Around 500 people had to be evacuated from Shepreth Wildlife Park, pictured, but were soon let back in . In one case an ‘apologetic and embarrassed’ parent admitted their young child had managed to push the button. There are three emergency panic buttons in public areas at the eight-acre site. Each has a large sign with red letters that says ‘Emergency use only. Use this button only in the event of seeing a tiger or puma out of its enclosure’. The zoo’s three big cats - tigers Amba and Rana and a puma called Tige - as well as three Eurasian lynx and two Scottish wildcats. There are also primates, a tropical house and a nocturnal house with free-flying bats. The site was founded as an animal sanctuary in 1979 and opened to the public five years later.","False alarm was raised at Shepreth Wildlife Park in Cambridgeshire .

"By . Jason Groves . Rising prosperity among ethnic minority voters could help swing the election for David Cameron, a new report revealed yesterday. Research by the Left-leaning Demos think-tank suggests the emergence of a significant black and Asian middle class could break Labour’s traditional stranglehold on the ethnic minority vote. The report, co-written by former Labour politician and equalities tsar Trevor Phillips, suggests ‘upwardly mobile’ ethnic minority voters are more likely to vote Tory. A report by think-tank Demos suggests 'upwardly mobile' ethnic minority voters are more likely to vote Tory in the 2015 election - breaking Labour's traditional stranglehold . It says Labour’s hold over ethnic minority voters fades as they prosper and move to the suburbs. The authors say there is a huge electoral prize for the party that can get to grips with Britain’s shifting demographics. The report states: ‘There is a great deal of evidence to suggest that any emerging volatility among the UK’s five million ethnic electors may turn out to be at least as significant as the three million who tell pollsters they might support Ukip in the forthcoming election.’ The study suggests that second- and third-generation immigrants are losing their ‘reflex’ support for Labour, particularly when they move to traditionally white middle-class areas. ‘The expectation would be that succeeding generations of minority voters may drift away from their parents’ reflex support for Labour – or at the very least might not inherit the first-generation immigrants’ hostility to the Conservatives,’ it says. The Tory party secured only 16 per cent of the minority vote in the last election compared with 68 per cent for Labour . ‘The other factor that could boost the Tory share of seats is a secular out-movement of ethnic minority families from the inner-city neighbourhoods in which they first settled. ‘The process is accelerating in London in particular due to the combination of spiralling inner-city housing costs and changes to the benefit system.’ A study of polling data shows that while 60 per cent of ethnic minority voters in non-white areas support Labour, the proportion falls to 48.1 per cent among those living in traditionally white neighbourhoods. The effect is particularly marked among voters from an Indian background, with Labour support among this group falling from 39 per cent to 13 per cent when they move to white suburbs. Mr Phillips suggests the effect is significant enough to swing the result in a string of marginal seats. He suggests that the Tories are more likely to hang on to Labour target seats such as Hendon and Wolverhampton South West because of the impact of ‘upwardly mobile Indian heritage, Tory- voting electors’. A study by the cross-party group Operation Black Vote last year found the number of seats where black and Asian voters could decide the outcome had rocketed by 70 per cent compared with the 2010 election. It suggests that the ethnic minority vote is bigger than the majority of the sitting MP in 168 marginal seats. The seats extend beyond inner-city areas to include Ipswich, Southampton and Oxford. In the last election the Tories secured only 16 per cent of the minority vote, compared with 68 per cent for Labour.","Labour's stranglehold on ethnic minority vote could slip due to emergence of black and Asian middle class, research shows .

"By . Alan Roden . Warning: Gordon Brown will tell Glasgow University that Scotland faces a 'time bomb' with its pensions . Scotland faces a £700 million pensions ‘black hole’ if the SNP wins the independence referendum, Gordon Brown will claim tonight. The former Prime Minister will join the Better Together campaign for the first time as he launches a passionate plea to ‘keep our pensions British’. In a major speech at Glasgow University tonight, Mr Brown will produce an internal document from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) showing the cash benefits to Scotland of staying in the UK. He will highlight the ‘time bomb’ facing the country as the number of elderly Scots is set to soar from 1 million to 1.3 million over the next 20 years, putting pressure on the welfare state. By 2030, there will be 42 pensioners for every 100 people of working age in Scotland – compared to only 40 in the rest of the UK. As part of the UK, Mr Brown will say, money from taxes generated in areas which have larger working-age populations, such as London, can be sent north to pay for the extra cost of State pensions. He will say the ‘extra benefit’ for Scots will rise from £425 million a year to £700 million as part of the country’s £9.6 billion pensions bill, which is three times  the estimated income from oil revenues in 2016-17. Mr Brown remains a popular figure north of the Border – but due to his hatred for the Tories and a personality clash with former Labour Chancellor and Better Together chairman Alistair Darling, he has avoided official pro-Union events until now. 'Time bomb': The number of elderly Scots is set to soar from 1 million to 1.3 million over the next 20 years . Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ‘The last person anyone in Scotland will take lessons from when it comes to pensions is Gordon Brown – the man who destroyed final salary pension schemes with his £100billion raid and insulted our older folk with a miserly 75p increase in the State pension. ‘His track record means he lacks all credibility.’","Former Prime Minister to join campaign, pleading 'keep pensions British'

"By . Leon Watson . One of Britain's most important fuel pipelines has been closed today after police discovered a gang of thieves had siphoned off thousands of gallons of diesel in a 'sophisticated' heist. It is believed more than 30,000 litres of diesel may have been taken from the pipeline running from Esso's Fawley Refinery in Hampshire. That would be worth about £41,000 ($70,000) at pump prices. The alarm was raised when the owner of an industrial unit in Romsey, near where the pipeline passes, discovered a large amount . of fuel hidden at the scene. A gang of thieves has tapped into one of the country's main underground fuel pipelines to steal more than 30,000 litres of diesel . Detectives have arrested two men, aged 32 and 34, in connection with the thefts. Today, police were guarding the spot in West Wellow, Hampshire, where the thieves are thought to have tapped into the 14-inch pipeline. The fuel is being stored safely and engineers from the refinery are working to retrieve it, police confirmed. The pipeline, known as the Midline Pipeline and owned by Esso, is one of the UK's main underground fuel supply routes for gas, diesel, gasoline and jet fuel. It runs 130 miles from the . Esso refinery in Fawley near Southampton to the West Midlands and is 14in in diameter. The pipeline cost £40 million to construct in the mid 1980s and was extended in the 1990s. It now runs out to Birmingham International Airport. Detectives are today investigating the 'sophisticated' and 'potentially lethal' plot to siphon the fuel . It has been reported that a similar incident took place recently in Gloucestershire. However, oil theft from pipelines is relatively . rare in the UK but a major problem in some parts of the world, such as . Nigeria where it is estimated to cost the government up to $1 billion . per month. An Esso spokesman: 'Esso is assisting Hampshire Police with their enquiries following the discovery of a store of fuel in the Romsey area. The pipeline runs 130 miles from the Esso refinery in Fawley near Southampton to the West Midlands and is 14in in diameter . 'Early indications suggest that the fuel may have come from a nearby Esso pipeline. Investigations continue into whether this is the case. 'Esso is committed to the very highest standards of safety. The pipeline has therefore been closed down and our specialists are working to check it and, if necessary, effect any repair. 'We will not resume operations of the pipeline until this work is complete.' Detectives from Hampshire Constabulary said they are investigating the 'sophisticated' and 'potentially lethal' plot to siphon the fuel. A force spokesman said: 'We can confirm two men, aged 32 and 34 from the Salisbury area, remain in police custody for questioning this evening. 'Both men were arrested in Salisbury last night on suspicion of conspiracy to steal fuel. 'Police launched an investigation after a large quantity of diesel was found in an industrial storage unit at West Wellow. 'Lines of inquiry include establishing the exact amount of fuel stolen and examining the suspected sophisticated method used in this alleged theft. 'The discovery was made by the unit's owner at around 7.30pm on Thursday. It is believed to have been illegally obtained. 'The exact quantity and circumstances surrounding the accumulation of fuel are central to the investigation, and detectives are focusing on identifying those responsible. 'The fuel is stored safely and securely and is being retrieved by engineers from the nearby Esso refinery. 'The investigation, led by Lyndhurst CID, is still in its early stages and this is all the information we are able to release at this time.'

"By . Lucy Crossley . An inmate who claims to be a practicing Jedi has accused prison bosses of 'intolerance and bigotry' after they refused to recognise his Star Wars-based beliefs. The prisoner at HMP & YOI Isis, a 622-capacity category C centre for young offenders on the HMP Belmarsh site in south London, said he was being denied his ‘right’ to follow the religion, which is based on the Star Wars films. The unnamed prisoner - who says he fears ‘retaliation from the . Dark Side’ if he is identified - said he was unhappy his right to religious freedom was . being denied. The force is strong: The inmate at HMP & YOI Isis, a category C centre for young offenders on the HMP Belmarsh site in south London (pictured), said he was being denied his 'right' to follow the religion, which is based on the Star Wars films . 'I recently put in an application asking that I be allowed to practise my religion freely - I am a Jedi,' he said, writing in prisoners’ magazine Inside . Time. 'The . written reply said ""Whilst Jedi is a recognised religion according to . the UK census, it is not recognised by the National Offender Management . Service and we cannot change your religious record because of this"". 'This is an example of the kind of . intolerance and religious bigotry faced by members of our faith on a . daily basis, both within the prison system and without. Inspiration: Alec Guinness as Jedi master Obi Wan Kenobi in the first Star Wars film A New Hope . 'Jedis . have been portrayed very negatively in the media ever since the tragic . battle of Yavin IV, when Luke Skywalker and a group of left-wing . militants targeted the Death Star in a terrorist attack, killing . thousands of civilian personnel. 'Please withhold my name in the paper as I fear retaliation from the Dark Side. May the force be with you.' The religion, which preaches meditation . and ‘accessing ancient inner knowledge’ before making decisions, was . officially recognised in the 2001 UK census, when it was the fourth most popular in the UK. According to group Temple Of The Jedi Order, those who follow Jediism are not role players, and are not the same as the fictional characters in the Star Wars films. Instead followers believe in the principles of Jediism, which includes 'Peace, Justice, Love, Learning and Benevolence'. Jedis also strive to bring about a greater level of spiritual awareness, compassion and a greater understanding of the universe and those living within it. Another group, Jedi Church, says Jedis believ in an all-powerful force which binds all things in the universe together, an is innate inside everyone. Many followers keep to the ‘21 maxims of Jediism’, which include ‘seeking excellence . in all endeavours’, ‘seeking the path of the right’, ‘acting with . honour’, and to ‘trusting the ways of the force’. In the film series, created by George Lucas, the monastic Jedi are trained to use the Force through passive meditation as well as practicing altruism, mercy, and a commitment to justice while rejecting emotions including love, passion, fear, anger and hate. The word 'jedi' is believed to have be to have been derived by Lucas from the Japanese 'jidaigeki'. In the films, Jedis have ‘no strict guidelines’, but . are known for keeping lightsabers, wearing ‘hooded robes’, and for . going into ‘meditative states’. Real life followers . keep to the ‘21 maxims of Jediism’, which include ‘seeking excellence . in all endeavours’, ‘seeking the path of the right’, ‘acting with . honour’, and to ‘trusting the ways of the force’. More than 390,000 people listed their religion as 'Jedi' in to 2001 census, however many were thought to have done so as a joke or a form of protest. In the 2012 census this figure dropped to 177,000 - still enough to make it the seventh most popular religion in the UK. In 2001 it was only beaten by Christianity (70 per cent), Muslim (3.1 per cent) and Hindu (2.1 per cent) after notching up 0.7 per cent of those polled. In the 2012 census it was in seventh place, excluding those who said they had ‘no religion’ or chose not to answer - behind Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Judaism and Buddhism. The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) currently recognises 18 religions, including Rastafarianism, Quakerism, Zoroastrianism and Paganism. One former prisoner, who asked not to be named, said: 'If the prison service say it’s alright to be a pagan in prison and carry little twigs about pretending they are wands or a spiritualist who believes they can speak to the dead, then I think it should be alright for a prisoner to be a Jedi. 'It’s discrimination, pure and simple - especially as it is now a recognised religion on the census.' A spokesman for the Prison Service said . that Jediism was 'not a recognised religion' and refused to comment on . 'individual cases'. Bad press: The unnamed prisoner said Jedis had been portrayed negatively in the media since Luke Skywalker (right) and a group of left-wing militants targeted the Death Star . In 2010, a man who described himself as a 'Star Wars follower' and 'Jedi Knight' was thrown out of a Jobcentre in Southend, Essex, for refusing to remove his hood, and later received an apology. A spokesman of the Jedi Church said: 'The Jedi Church believes that there is one all powerful force that binds all things in the universe together. 'The Jedi religion is something innate inside everyone of us, the Jedi Church believes that our sense of morality is innate. So quiet your mind and listen to the force within you!' Practice: In the film series Jedi are trained to use the Force through passive meditation as well as practicing altruism, mercy, and a commitment to justice .

It was a horrible time.

Luck: The family discovered Kacey was a bone marrow match after a routine test to check she was also not suffering from the condition . 'Milly couldn't do anything. She couldn’t go to the beach, to the forest, be . near cut grass or wood - it was all too much of a risk of infection. 'She couldn’t even go to the shops or leave the house.'

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A centuries-old ban on marriage between different members of India's rigid caste system has been overturned by an influential tribal council. Previously Hindus in India, who live according to a complicated system of classification, had to marry according to prohibitive social guidelines. But now a council - known as a panchayat - in Haryana, northwestern India, has relaxed its marriage policy, allowing 36 different castes in the area to marry freely. Relaxing the rules: Thanks to the changes, many people in Haryana, northern Indian, will be able to marry outside their caste . The matches will still have to be approved by the bride and groom's parents, but has been hailed as a 'positive development' by campaigners in the region, the Telegraph reported. Although the move will significantly widen the pool of potential matches, a separate ban on marrying too close to home still stands, banning matches between anyone from the same village or the same 'gotra' (an extended family unit similar to a clan). Victim: Manjit Singh, pictured, was murdered after eloping for a forbidden marriage . In the past, those who defied the ban have been brutally punished. In September a 23-year-old student and his girlfriend, 20, were beheaded and beaten to death respectively for having a forbidden relationship. Last year two parents who poisoned and strangled their 19-year-old daughter for eloping were caught by police halfway through burning her corpse. Council leaders have denied ordering 'honour' killings such as these. The leader of the Satrol khap panchayat, which has relaxed its ban, said that the change was thanks to declining numbers of suitable partners for young people in the area. The council is the biggest in the area. Inder Singh said: 'The . number of unmarried youth has increased in past few decades and people . were forced to bring brides from outside the state. We decided to allow . inter-caste marriages, provided both the families agree to the proposal.' According to the Times of India, the new rules will apply to across the area controlled by the panchayat, which covers 42 villages which contain 36 different castes. Around 60 per cent of the population, which is spread out over 100 square miles, belong to the Jat ethnic group who are subject to the marriage rules. The Satrol khap panchayat is not the first council to relax its marriage ban, but is one of the most significant. Some are hailing the move as the beginning of a much more widespread change in attitudes. Sanjoy Sachdev, who founded a group called Love Commandos group which helps couples elope to get round the bans, praised the move. He said: 'Itâ€™s a positive development. Itâ€™s a beginning. Rome was not built in a day. A love revolution is fast taking over the country.'","The Satrol khap panchayat, in Haryana, northern India, revised its ban .
Now people will be able to marry from any of 36 castes in the region .
However, it remains forbidden to marry within your village or tribe ."
"By . Belinda Robinson . Three swans have been beheaded and their carcasses discarded opposite a pub. The severed heads of three birds were found by anglers close to Mount Farm Lake near Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire last week. Steven Cooper, the fisheries officer and secretary of the Beacon Angling Club, discovered the first head lying on the lakeside. Majestic creatures: All swans in Britain are the property of Queen Elizabeth II, who owns all mute swans . He said: 'I’ve been a member of the club for 10 years, but have never known anything like this. 'I was out one afternoon and the head was just lying there by the waterside opposite The Inn On The Lake pub. 'Anyone could have come across it - a runner, someone walking their dogs, a small child. It was horrible. 'We have found three heads, and one of them had the body close by it. It doesn’t look like it was done by an animal, it was a sharp blade that took the heads off.

'Some sick person is out there with a vendetta against these swans and they’ve got to be stopped.' All swans in Britain are the property . of Queen Elizabeth II, who owns all mute swans. In a law dating back to . the 12th century, swans have been owned by the Royal household who once . considered them a delicacy. The swans were marked by a . royal Swan Marker, a job still in existence, but it now focuses on offering advise to various . organisations about the welfare of swans and . vandalism against the bird. Today, killing a swan can result in a six-month jail sentence and/or a fine of up to £5,000. Mr Cooper is urging anyone with information to contact the police. He added: 'We keep an eye on what is going on at the lake. Our bailiffs monitor the lake daily and have been told about the issue. 'As a club we take responsibility for all wildlife here - the swans, the geese, the foxes and the owl. 'In the past we have been in the lake saving cygnets which have got caught, or other injured birds. 'The animals were here before we were, and it’s up to us to share the area.

"By . Lucy Crossley . Commuters are facing five days of travel disruption as rail workers stage a series of strikes in three separate disputes over issues including pay, pensions and jobs. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union will take industrial action against London Underground (LU), Transport for London (TfL) and the Heathrow Express in the coming weeks. Underground workers will walk out for 48 hours from 9pm on April 28 and again for three days from 9pm on May 5 in the long-running row over Tube ticket office closures. Disruption: Following a tube strike in February, commuters are facing five days of travel disruption as rail workers stage a series of strikes starting later this month . Repeat: The latest round of strikes comes after a two-day strike in February caused transport issues across London, and a second planned strike was called off at the eleventh hour . The latest round of strikes comes after a two-day strike in February caused transport issues across London, and a second planned strike was called off at the eleventh hour. TfL said it would review ticket office closures station by station, which could result in some ticket offices remaining open. The . concession gave them a two-month breathing space for further talks, but these have now failed - leading to the latest round of strikes. The first two days of action will take place ahead of a May Day event in London in memory of former RMT leader Bob Crow, and Tony Benn, who died within days of each other last month. Dispute: The RMT is also staging a strike at the Heathrow Express train service for 48 hours from 3am on April 29 in a row over jobs, pay and cuts . RMT members at TfL, who work in admin roles, will strike for 48 hours from 9pm on April 28 in a dispute over pensions. The union is also staging a strike at the Heathrow Express train service for 48 hours from 3am on April 29 in a row over jobs, pay and cuts. The union said plans to re-organise the workforce to save £6 million over the next five years threatened 201 jobs. 'RMT does not buy for a moment the case for handing out savage cuts to Heathrow Express when Heathrow is generating hand-outs to shareholders of over £600 million,' said RMT acting general secretary Mick Cash. Action: Commuters are pictured walking at Waterloo station in London, England, in an attempt to avoid the crowded tube trains during February's strike . Alternative: Commuters board the extra buses put on to help ease the disruption caused by the last strike at Stratford Station . However, Keith Greenfield, managing director of Heathrow Express, said he hoped that an agreement with the union could be reached. 'We remain eager to continue our productive discussions with RMT union reps and we still hope they choose to resolve the dispute around the table rather than through damaging industrial action,' he said. 'A strike is not the answer. It will increase costs when we are trying to reduce them, taking us further away from what we need to do to secure our business for the future. Remembrance: The first two days of action will take place ahead of a May Day event in London in memory of former RMT leader Bob Crow (left), and Tony Benn (right), who died within days of each other last month . Memorial: A poster in honour of Bob Crow is displayed at Putney Bridge underground station following his death . 'However, we will not let it stop us providing an excellent service for our customers. We have a robust contingency plan that will enable us to run regular trains for as long as any industrial action lasts.' The union continues to be opposed to plans to close Tube ticket offices on London Underground, saying hundreds of jobs will be lost. LU maintains that only three per cent of tickets are bought at offices now, and has pledged to switch staff to other areas of stations.","Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union to strike .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Ralph Vaughan Williams's The Lark Ascending has risen to the top of the annual Classic FM Hall Of Fame list . The music played during the tearful final moments of Coronation Street's Hayley Cropper has been named the nation's favourite piece of classical music. Ralph Vaughan Williams's The Lark Ascending has risen to the top of the annual Classic FM Hall Of Fame list, compiled from more than 100,000 votes from the station's listeners. The composition - written in its earliest form exactly a century ago - toppled Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto No 2, which has reigned for three years. The Lark Ascending last topped the poll in 2010 and three years ago it was named the nation's favourite Desert Island Discs tune. British composer Vaughan Williams was inspired by a poem of the same name by George Meredith and his first version for violin and piano was written in 1914. Some six years later he completed the more familiar orchestral version. It found a wide audience recently when it was played as Hayley, played by Julie Hesmondhalgh, took a lethal cocktail to end her suffering on ITV's Coronation Street, following a battle with cancer. It was the long-standing character's favourite piece of music. The Classic FM Hall Of Fame list features a strong showing for orchestral music used in video games, with two entries in the top 20. The station began to broadcast game soundtracks regularly last year, thought to have help boost its profile among a younger audience. The music for the Final Fantasy series, written by Japanese composer Nobuo Uematsu, was the highest video game at number seven, while The Elder Scrolls Series, composed by Jeremy Soule, was 17. Mozart achieved the most entries in the chart with 22 entries in the overall top 300 - up from 19 last year - with his Clarinet Concerto at number five proving his most popular . Classic FM presenter John Suchet said: 'Exactly 100 years after Vaughan Williams composed The Lark Ascending, its poignancy and beauty are as powerful as ever.' The station is releasing an album featuring many of the most popular pieces and the full top 300 - which was being counted down over the Easter weekend - will be at classicfm.com.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Commons Speaker John Bercow has run up a staggering half a million pounds in office expenses in just five years, it has been revealed. Mr Bercow has incurred £495,592 in taxpayer-funded events, travel, clothes and other supplies since taking up the prestigious role in June 2009. This includes £100,000 on overseas jaunts and £26,000 in formal dresswear - with £3,700 spent on just two suits. Speaker: John Bercow has run up half a million pounds in office expenses in five years, it has been revealed . It also includes more than £170,000 on 'official entertainment', £40,283 on UK travel, and even £2,400 on curtain cleaning. Details of the Speaker's office expenses were obtained by The Sun under Freedom of Information laws. The figures reveal Mr Bercow has run up £3,442 on TV licences, £7,104 on telecoms, and £7,308 on newspapers. But he has notched up a less pricey sum of £251 on late night transport - with just £9 spent on postage. Prestigious role: Mr Bercow has incurred £495,592 on taxpayer-funded events, travel, clothes and other supplies since taking up the Commons role in June 2009. This includes £170,000 on 'official entertainment' Last year's bill - totalling £59,709 - was two-thirds lower than in 2009/10, during which more than £180,000 was run up in expenses. This appears to be due to the government's chauffeured car service - which cost taxpayers a whopping £36,254 in 2009/10, £11,362 in 2010/11, but nothing in the past three years. A spokesman for the Speaker's office, which has six staff, told MailOnline: 'Every effort is taken to keep running costs down. 'Office costs have been cut by two thirds since Mr Speaker took office.'

It comes just days after Mr Bercow was accused of putting  MPs’ safety in jeopardy after backing the 'sack[ing]’ of Scotland Yard and use of private security to take on a high-profile role at the Commons. Mr Bercow was told he was risking ‘disaster’ by agreeing to the privatisation of the airport-style searching and screening of visitors to the Palace of Westminster. The move, agreed with the House of Lords, comes amid complaints that the cost of the Metropolitan Police’s contract for the security of the entire Palace – £31 million a year – is too high.","Commons Speaker John Bercow has notched up £495,592 bill since 2009 .

"Thugs who repeatedly crashed a stolen lorry into the front of a house leaving it in danger of collapsing were being hunted by police tonight. The three tonne flat-bed vehicle was believed to have deliberately ploughed into the two-bedroom semi-detached house, in what was thought to be an 'ongoing localised dispute'. Neighbours reported hearing a noise 'like . an earthquake' or a 'bomb going off' as the two balaclava clad men drove . into the house three times before running away from the scene in Spondon, Derbyshire. Damage: This two-bedroom house in Spondon, Derbyshire, was left on the verge of collapse after thugs repeatedly crashed a stolen lorry into it . The owners of the . Â£120,000 property were not present at the time of the Bank Holiday . attack, which took place at around 4.50am today. Next door neighbour, Kay Nyakale, 23, said those living nearby were forced to flee their homes as it was feared the house would collapse. 'This is traumatic, to say the least,' he said. 'It's incredibly shocking, the house felt like an earthquake and it was shaking for a few seconds afterwards. 'I came outside and saw a lorry in the yard and the front of the neighbour's house was completely gone. Scene: Police sealed off the road and launched a manhunt for the two suspects . 'We were told to evacuate the house immediately and told it was a health hazard. 'I . feel like a victim of this atrocious attack on the property, it's the . most shocking thing that's ever happened outside my front door.' Anne Byrne, 51, who also lives near . the scene, added: 'I heard a bang last night and saw two or three men . shouting - I don't know what it was about, but they got into a truck. 'It must have been one hell of a crash, it was like a bomb going off.' Another . eyewitness, who wished to remain anonymous, said: 'I was coming back . from being out in town and got out of a taxi as I live up the road from . where it happened. 'As first we thought the van was just reversing but then we heard the hit going into the building. 'The . taxi driver didn't want to let us out a first. It was scary. When it . hit, it was a really loud bang, then men in balaclavas ran out of the van . and into the house. I think there were four or five. 'They then came back out of the house with nothing and jumped into a car and drove off.' Police sealed off the road and a man-hunt was immediately launched, but so far no arrests have been made. Officers are now appealing for witnesses after the incident, which involved the lorry allegedly stolen from a waste management company in Staffordshire. 'Two men were seen to get out of the stolen vehicle and make off in a white van,' said a police spokesman. 'No one was in the house at the time and no one was injured. 'No weapons were used or seen.'","Three tonne flat-bed vehicle repeatedly driven into two-bedroom home .

"By . Wills Robinson . Oscar Pistorius has been accused of taking acting lessons before standing trial for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. A South African journalist wrote an open letter to the blade runner alleging he had taken guidance from one of her 'close friends' before taking the stand in Pretoria. British-born columnist Jani Allan has called the paralympian a 'faux hero' who has 'betrayed people and disappointed his fans.' Scroll down for video from the trial . Allegations: South African journalist Jani Allan has claimed Oscar Pistorius is taking acting lessons from one of her 'close friends' Condemned: She has called him a 'faux hero' and says his coach has an 'impossible task' Her letter reads: 'I have it from a reliable source that you are taking acting lessons for your days in court. Your coach has an impossible task.' 'Oscar, I look at you mewling and puking in the witness stand. You truly represent everything that the West loathes about white South Africans who live extravagant lives in their expensive laagers.' Asked about her letter, she told The Sunday People: 'I have this information from extremely reliable sources.' She also compares Pistorius to Eugene Terre'Blanche, who served three years in prison for assaulting a petrol station attendant and for the attempted murder of a black security guard around 1996. She said of him: 'Terre’blanche was cut from the same cloth as you, Oscar. 'He was given to boasting, vain in all things, narcissistic in the extreme and flying into terrible rages when things didn’t go his way. I suspect this description fits you.' The Paralympic superstar has frequently wept and been sick during the more difficult moments of his trial. Reeva's mother June Steenkamp has also accused the South African of acting out, referring to moments he has wept uncontrollable while sitting in the dock. In the early stages of his trial Dr Denise Bjerkman analysed his body language. Curious: The claims came just weeks after Reeva's mother accused the paralympian of acting . She said: 'Oscar has to project a complex image of innocence and grief to the mass media and court. 'His squeaky clean image . comes natural to him with his short hair, relaxed wide-eyed response in . social interaction and charming smile. 'What Oscar has to juggle in court is his . three public personas: the boyish wonder he stage-managed for the global . media – who will challenge any obstacle and which refutes his . disability; the humble, controlled, grieving Oscar for public . consumption in the courts and the suave flash Harry, fast cars, gung-ho . image of Oscar with adoring women draped on his arm. 'His dramatic, tearful breakdown in . court - when the brutal wounds on Reeva’s Steenkamp’s body were . discussed - is more likely to be conveniently staged. I believe such behaviour serves to hide his feelings of sickening guilt and vulnerability.' Pistorius admits shooting 29-year-old Reeva on Valentine's Day last year but denies premeditated murder and two counts related to shooting a gun. The trail continues on May 5. Acting? On many occasions throughout the trial he has been seen cowering in the dock with heads in his hand . Distracted: The paralympian has even been caught looking at his phone during court proceedings .

Mr Cooksey, who studies German troop . patterns, added: 'No contact with the British Expeditionary Force near . Mons has been reported that day.' He said opposition troops would have rushed to take credit for the death, because of their eagerness to be . commended and praised for their actions. The reconnaissance cyclist with the 4th battalion, Middlesex Regiment, is believed to have lied about his age to enlist, telling forces he was 17. He is due to be honoured on August 4 at a special Anglo-German service to mark 100 years since war was declared. A senior member of the Royal Family will visit his grave as part at St Symphorien near Mons in Belgium. Claims: German cavalry are believed to have been at least 10 miles away when Private Parr died, causing military experts to think is death may have been a result of an accident or 'friendly fire' (file picture) Remembrance: Men who helped to stem the German invasion of Belgium in 1914 march through the streets of Mons, the town where Private Parr is buried . Between 1914 and the warâ€™s end, almost one million more British troops lost their lives. The . last British soldier killed in action was Private George Ellison. He . was also shot at Mons, just before the official ceasefire at 11am on . November 11, 1918. A Â£50m programme to commemorate the First World War is being planned by the Government, beginning with a major church service in Glasgow on August 4. There will be six landmark events between 2014 and Armistice Day in 2018 Armistice Day, where a large nationwide event will mark the end of the war supposed to end all wars. Mr Cooksey also exposed other myths surrounding the early stages of the Great War. Captain Charles Hornby has been credited as the first person to draw blood during an incursion on August 22 by 'running his man through' with a sword. However claims that German accounts have revealed none of their soldiers were seriously injured.","Private John Parr will be honoured in an Anglo-German ceremony in August .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Anna Hodgekiss . Raising money: Sophie Raworth ran both the London and Boston marathons for Cancer Research UK . Newsreader Sophie Raworth completed the Boston marathon last night, dedicating her run to BBC colleague George Alagiah, who was recently diagnosed with bowel cancer. After finishing the race, the presenter, who flew to America just eight days after completing the London marathon, tweeted: ‘Boston is hot, Boston is hilly, Boston hurt. But I did it!! 4:02. George @BBCAlagiah this is for you. Get better xx’. Miss Raworth, 45, who posted a picture of herself with her medals from London and Boston, ran to raise money for Cancer Research UK. Mr Alagiah – who is taking a break from television while he has treatment – thanked her, writing: ‘What a friend, what a woman! @sophieraworth thank you for running @bostonmarathon in aid of cancer research’. The 58-year-old, who has been a familiar figure on TV news bulletins for many years, is said to be 'optimistic' about a positive outcome. He will be off air for the near future while he receives treatment, the BBC said last week. The Sri Lanka-born journalist has been the face of BBC1’s News at Six since 2007. He was made an OBE in 2008's New Year Honours. In a statement the BBC said: 'He is grateful for all the good wishes he has received thus far and is optimistic for a positive outcome. 'George asks that he and his family are given the space and privacy they require whilst he recovers. 'Our thoughts are with him and his family and we send them our very best wishes during this time. 'Until such time as George is well enough to return to work the BBC News at Six and GMT on BBC World News will be presented as usual by familiar faces from BBC News.' She dedicated the race to her colleague George Alagiah, 58, who announced he has bowel cancer . Eight days earlier, Miss Raworth, 45, brandished her medal for the London marathon, run for the same cause . Mr Alagiah first began hosting the 6pm news bulletin in early 2003, but he stepped up to front it solo four years later following the departure of his co-host Natasha Kaplinsky. He has been married to his wife, Frances Robathan, for 30 years and has two sons, Adam and Matthew. He was educated at St John's College, an independent Catholic boarding school in Portsmouth. He went on to read politics at Durham University's Van Mildert College. He has previously been a prominent foreign correspondent, often as a specialist in Africa with coverage of civil wars in Somalia and Liberia, as well as the genocide in Rwanda 20 years ago. Mr Alagiah joined the BBC 25 years ago after working as a print journalist and he has gone on to write a number of books including A Home From Home, which looked at what it means to be British. Mr Alagiah will be off air as he receives treatment, 11 years after he started hosting the 6pm news . He has also presented other shows such as Mixed Britannia, looking at the UK’s mixed-race population. Bowel cancer is the third most common type of cancer in men, behind prostate and lung, with almost three-quarters of cases affecting people over the age of 65. In response to the news, Mark Flannagan, chief executive of the charity Beating Bowel Cancer, said: 'We’re sorry to hear that George Alagiah has been diagnosed with bowel cancer. We wish him all the best with his treatment and recovery. 'Almost 41,000 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer every year in the UK, that’s one person every 30 minutes. 'However, bowel cancer is very treatable when caught in the early stages when over 90% of cases can be successfully treated.'","Newsreader flew to America for the race 8 days after London marathon .

"By . Sam Webb . On the day his former employer announced a staggering £2.5billion loss, former Co-op bank boss Paul Flowers was enjoying an all-night drinking session, it has been claimed. The 63-year-old, who recently underwent a stint in rehab, allegedly invited an escort to his home in Salford, Greater Manchester, in the early hours of last Thursday,   admitting he was 'trolleyed'. The Co-op's loss announcement comes after its banking division plunged into losses last year with Methodist Minister Flowers at the helm. He was filmed by The Mail on Sunday allegedly   buying class A drugs in November. In March he spoke about the drugs allegations, saying: 'I have sinned' and admitted to 'frailties' in an interview with BBC's Newsnight. Disgraced former Co-op Bank boss Paul Flowers (centre) with minders at Stainbeck Police Station, Leeds, on Wednesday. A male escort has spoken of being texted by the former minister as he partied on the day the Co-op announced record losses . The escort, 22-year-old Dale Westwood, claims the texts started at 1am and continued until 11am. The pair had met at a party in Bradford, West Yorkshire, last month. Mr   Westwood claims Mr Flowers has repeatedly asked him to visit him, but he has always refused. 'I can't believe he has been so brazen. Most of the bank's failures are down to him, yet he doesn't have a care in the world.' Last week Flowers, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, was charged with possession of Class A drugs cocaine and methamphetamine as well as the Class C drug ketamine. Flowers's solicitor Andrew Hollas said the former bank boss would make a 'full statement' following his appearance at Leeds Magistrates Court on May 7. The Crown Prosecution Service said it had 'carefully considered' a file of evidence against Flowers before pressing charges. The escort says Flowers blames the people who employed him for the bank's failures. Reverend Paul Flowers in front of the Treasury Select Committee in November, 2013 . Mr Westwood added that Flowers says those who put him in charge were 'stupid' and was joking about the news stories surrounding him. He told the Sun: 'The Co-op are in a bad way and he doesn't recognise how he has been involved in that - he blames anyone but himself.' Flowers was suspended by both the Methodist Church and the Labour Party following allegations that he bought and used illegal drugs. Last week Flowers, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, was charged with possession of Class A drugs cocaine and methamphetamine as well as the Class C drug ketamine. Former City Minister Lord Myners was appointed to assess the Co-op Group's system of elections and appointments. He resigned last week in the face of bitter resistance from board members but plans to complete his review.  A separate review by Sir Chris Kelly, chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life – an advisory Government body – is looking into how the Co-op Bank came close to   collapse last year. His report is expected after Easter.  Last week the bank announced a £1.3 billion loss for 2013 and launched an emergency plan to raise £400 million to plug a hole in its finances. There have been repeated questions about how Flowers was ever put in charge, despite having almost no knowledge of the banking sector. Last year it failed to buy 632 Lloyds TSB branches when a £1.5billion hole was discovered in its finances. Neville Richardson, the former chief executive of the Co-op Bank, blamed the banks’s problems on the way it managed its loan portfolio after he left, but the banker was contradicted by Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Prudential Regulation Authority, who said the losses mainly derived from assets acquired when the Co-op took over the Britannia Building Society.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . The United States is planning to deploy about 150 soldiers for military exercises to begin in Poland and Estonia in the next few weeks, a Western official said Saturday. The exercises would follow Russia's buildup of forces near its border with Ukraine and its annexation last month of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said earlier this week that the U.S. is looking for ways to reassure its NATO allies of its strong commitment to collective defense. Exercises: The U.S. already has two warships docked in the Black Sea capable of launching a missile-defense system . Russia: The U.S. wants to reassure its allies that it is committed to defending against a threat from pro-Russian forces (pictured) in the Ukraine . The Pentagon's press secretary, Rear Adm. John Kirby, said in a statement Friday that American officials are considering a range of additional measures to bolster air, maritime and ground readiness in Europe. Ground exercises in Poland and Estonia would last about two weeks but such exercises would continue on a rotating basis off and on over time, the official said, and other locations in Eastern Europe would be considered. The official was not authorized to discuss the plan by name because it has not been made final and requested anonymity. No specific date for the deployment of an Army company, which usually consists of 150 soldiers, has been set but an announcement was expected next week, the official said. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel says 'there's an entire range of possibilities and measures that are being considered . Kirby's statement about additional measures didn't offer specifics. 'Some of those activities will be pursued bilaterally with individual NATO nations. Some will be pursued through the alliance itself,' he said. On Thursday, Hagel met at the Pentagon with his Polish counterpart, Tomasz Siemoniak, and told reporters that they had identified new areas of military-to-military cooperation, including special operations forces, air forces and additional military exercises and training, as part of their discussion of closer defense ties. 'Thereâ€™s an entire range of possibilities and measures that are being . considered,' Hagel said on Thursday in a joint . news conference with Siemoniak. 'Rotational basis of training and exercises are always part of that.' Unstable: Ukrainian troops killed three pro-Russian fighters who attacked a National Guard base in the Ukraine . Three additional Russian militants were killed in a gun battle near the eastern Ukrainian town of Slavyansk . In an interview with The Washington Post, Siemoniak said the decision to deploy U.S. ground forces to Poland had been made on a political level and that details were being worked out, the newspaper reported. 'The idea until recently was that there were no more threats in Europe and no need for a U.S. presence in Europe any more,' Siemoniak said, speaking through an interpreter during a visit Friday to the newspaper. 'Events show that what is needed is a re-pivot, and that Europe was safe and secure because America was in Europe,' he continued.","The U.S. plans to deploy about 150 troops for military exercises in Poland and Estonia in the next several weeks .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A cat who lived on a diet of roasted meats and jam doughnuts was forced to go on a health kick after ballooning to nearly two stones. George, from Liverpool, weighed more than 26lbs - around the size of a King Charles spaniel - when his owner was warned he could die. The 15-year-old's owner had been feeding George roast ham, fresh prawns and entire roast chickens from supermarkets. Who's a big lad! Chubby George, from Liverpool, weighed as much as a King Charles spaniel and was at risk of developing diabetes after being fed an unhealthy diet of doughnuts and luxurious roasted meats. He soon grew so big that he could hardly move off the sofa and was at risk of developing diabetes. Owner Wendy Moulton was warned her cat could die if she carried on giving him such huge meals. She said: 'The weight was piling on him and when I noticed that his back legs were so thick I had to do something about it. 'He would eat anything that he wanted and he would be very spoilt. 'For instance, I would get him a roast chicken from the supermarket and he would eat that. 'So I took him to the vets and I was told that he almost had diabetes and if I didn't control his diet I would lose him.' Lazy: George, 15, weighed two stones would spend his heavier days lounging on the sofa. He ate a diet of roast chicken, fresh prawns and doughnuts, which was given to him by his owner Wendy Moulton . George was put on a special diet of dried food and water. He has now lost half of his body fat and weighs around 14lbs. Rachel Hughes-Wiseman, head veterinary nurse at Vets4Pets in Liverpool, where George was treated, said the cat is now much healthier. She said: 'He was the size of a King .

That's better: George went on to lose more than 12lbs after being put on a special diet by Rachel Hughes-Wiseman, head veterinary nurse at Vets4Pets .

"By . Belinda Robinson . British households are set to enjoy more disposable income as the economy stages a recovery and consumer spending power receives a welcome boost, according to a major think tank. The figures by the Centre for Economics and Business Research showed that consumer spending is expected to rise by 1.5 per cent helping growth to reach its highest point since 2007. It predicts that real household disposable income will reverse the 0.6 per cent fall of last year. His plan: Chancellor George Osborne will welcome the news as proof that his economic plan for Britain is finally working . Chancellor George Osborne will welcome the news as proof that his economic plan for Britain is finally working. But critics suggest that many people simply do not feel better off and many more are struggling to pay the bills and afford basic necessities. According to the consultancy's report, the economy hit two key important benchmarks last week which will help households to feel better off. Unemployment fell below the 7 per cent . threshold set by the Bank of England as the litmus test for raising . interest rates - something which was recently changed. Ed Miliband: Labour is warning that there is still a 'cost of living crisis' Labour has warned that there is still a 'cost of living crisis' despite the recent round of positive economic news. Even the Chancellor sounded a note of caution, admitting that millions of people still face pressures on their budgets - in acceptance that Ed Miliband's claims of a . cost of living crisis resonates with millions of cash-strapped voters. The Bank of England had pledged not to lift interest rates until there was a fall in unemployment to 7 per cent. But . that policy of forward guidance has now been abandoned after . joblessness declined much quicker than had been expected, with that . target reached, as growth picked up speed last year. Rate-setters . are now using a new ‘fuzzy’ guidance linking monetary policy to a more . opaque measure of how far the economy is running below its capacity. Interest rates have been left unchanged at . 0.5 per cent, as Bank of England policymakers allow the UK's . recovery to gather pace. The Bank's monetary policy committee . now has the luxury of leaving rates at their five-year record low. While the news on employment and record low rates, is welcome, over 15 million households are . financially vulnerable, struggling to cope with monthly bills and . constantly worried about losing their jobs, a poll has found. According to a poll by debt charity Stepchange around 15million people are ‘living on the edge,’ despite the improving economy. For . many people, the problem is that they are either falling behind on . bills or are trying to plug gaps in their income by using credit to pay . for essential outgoings. Many blame this on an uneven recovery, heavily reliant on household consumption. Households with children are more likely to be in financial difficulty, the survey found (Source: StepChange) However, the report by the Centre for Economics and Business Research suggests that the economic recovery will now be more balanced. It may even lead the Chancellor to offer tax cuts worth up to £7billion. Last year, household consumption accounted for 80 per cent of the overall growth, but that figure is expected to be halved as businesses spend more. Meanwhile, investment in British businesses is predicted to surge 10.1 per cent in real terms over the course of this year. Another buoyant driver of growth is the business sector which has remained strong, particularly construction with plenty of house building taking place. On an annual basis, construction output rose 2.8 percent in February compared with a 5.7 percent increase in January, according to the Office for national Statistics. But soggy weather throughout Britain in . February put a dampener on the construction trade as output shrank. Despite this, the consultancy has pushed up its growth forecast from 2.8 per cent to 3.1 per cent. The . construction industry is seen as a good indicator of the health of the . overall British economy as construction accounts for 6.3 per cent of . gross domestic product. Elsewhere, consumer confidence in the UK is growing according to Deloitte which said that confidence had reached its highest level in two years in the first quarter of 2014.","Households are expected to enjoy more disposable income, according to a report .

Anne-Marie also used social media to defend her boyfriend, Kevin Park, who was seen being led from the property by police after Madison's body was removed . Police and ambulance crews were called to a ground floor flat in Kelty, Fife at around 6.30pm on Sunday night after concerns were raised for the child's welfare. The two-year-old, named locally as Madison Horn, was taken to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy but was later pronounced dead. Officers are now investigating the death, which they described as 'suspicious'. They said that they are 'following a positive line of enquiry' but declined to comment on whether anyone has been detained. It is understood that Madison, who had just been accepted to nursery, was staying at the flat overnight with her mother, Anne-Marie White, 21, but did not live there permanently. Also in the flat was Ms White's boyfriend, Kevin Park, who she had been dating since late last year. Today, Ms White paid tribute to her daughter on Facebook - saying: 'She was just far too young.' Speaking about the death, she added: 'Well I suppose everyone knows I lost my precious little girl last night and I know what everyone is saying, especially about Kevin.

'The family have lived in that house a while. Anne Marie's mum stayed there before.' Tearfully, Ms Watson added: 'It's shocking and so sad. She's almost [the same age as] my son, it's just terrible. I can't imagine what the family are going through.' Catherine Pryde, 59, who lives in the neighbouring  flat, said she was first alerted to the tragedy by the sound of sirens. She said: 'I just heard the sirens and saw the ambulance come into the street. There were a lot of police and paramedics. 'Then the baby came out - the paramedic came running out with her in his arms. She was lifeless - it was just horrible.

"By . Damien Gayle . Russia says it has bolstered its forces along the border with Ukraine as a precaution against the unrest in the country spilling over into Russia. The Kremlin previously claimed that troops were in the area on routine exercises, but their presence sparked accusations that it was about to march into troubled east Ukraine. The largely Russian-speaking region has been gripped by a separatist insurgency following the overthrow of Ukraine's pro-Russian former president following mass protests in Kiev. Scroll down for video . Separatist insurgents guard barricades in Slavyansk: Militants have refused to surrender weapons or give up occupied buildings, despite a diplomatic accord reached in Geneva between Russia, Ukraine, the US, and the EU . A Ukrainian government 'anti-terrorist operation' to clear the insurgents this week ended in farce, with troops apparently switching sides and giving up their armoured vehicles to the militants. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov today insisted Russia had reinforced its battalions near the Ukrainian borders to protect Russian territory. Western intelligence sources say that an estimated 40,000 Russian troops are now deployed in areas bordering Ukraine, raising fears of an invasion into the east of the country which has a large Russian-speaking population. 'We ... have forces in the region of the Ukrainian border,' Mr Peskov said today on Russian television. 'Some of these forces are based there permanently, others are there to reinforce, against the backdrop of what is happening in Ukraine itself.' He added: 'Forgive me but, [Ukraine] is a country where there has just been a military coup, so naturally any country is going to take particular precautionary measures in terms of ensuring its security.' He said as a sovereign state, Russia was free to deploy troops anywhere on its territory without restrictions. He denied allegations that the Russian military was interfering in events inside Ukrainian territory. Those assertion were, said Mr Peskov, 'completely wrong.' Western diplomats have accused Russia of helping to foment the uprising in east Ukraine in anticipation of a crackdown it can use as a pretext to invade. Last month the sudden appearance of heavily armed, masked men in Crimea preceded that province's sudden secession from Ukraine and subsequent referendum vote to affiliate to the Russian Federation. After weeks of denials, Russian President Vladimir Putin this week admitted that at least some of those men were Russian soldiers, as had been widely suspected. Not Russian troops, honest! Gunmen patrol the streets in downtown Slavyansk, a town which has become symbolic of the insurgency against the new pro-West government which seized power in Kiev in February . Today a peace deal thrashed out between Russia, Ukraine, the EU and the U.S. aiming to end  east Ukraine's insurgency was teetering on the brink of collapse after militants ignored calls to lay down their arms. Leaders of the gunmen who have taken over official buildings in and around the Donetsk region demanded that the leaders of the Kiev uprising which overthrew former president Viktor Yanukovych first quit their government posts. Moscow yesterday renewed its insistence that it has no control over the militants - a denial that the Western allies of the new Ukrainian government do not accept. The U.S. warned of heavier economic sanctions than those already imposed over Crimea if Moscow failed to uphold the Geneva deal - or if it moved to send troops massed on the border into Ukraine. 'We believe that Russia has considerable influence over the actions of those who have been engaged in destabilising activities in eastern Ukraine,' national security adviser Susan Rice said. 'If we don't see action commensurate with the commitments that Russia has made yesterday in Geneva ... then obviously we've been very clear that we and our European partners remain ready to impose additional costs on Russia. 'Those costs and sanctions could include targeting very significant sectors of the Russian economy.' Separatist: A pro-Russian activist wears a helmet with text reading 'I speak Russian' as he takes part in a rally in front of the regional state building seized by pro-Russian separatists, in the eastern Ukrainian city of Slavyansk . President Vladimir Putin's spokesman hit back, while voicing scepticism - of a kind also heard from the Ukrainian government - about how useful the cautiously worded Geneva pact would be. 'You can't treat Russia like a guilty schoolboy,' said Dmitry Peskov. 'That kind of language is unacceptable.' The Russian Foreign Ministry said: 'The Americans are once again stubbornly trying to whitewash the actions of the Kiev authorities, who have embarked on a course of violently suppressing protesters in the southeast who are expressing their legitimate indignation over the infringements of their rights.' Later in the day, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and urged 'full and immediate compliance' with the Geneva agreement, a senior State Department official said. 'He made clear that the next few days would be a pivotal period for all sides to implement the statement's provisions, particularly that all illegal armed groups must be disarmed and all illegally seized buildings must be returned to legitimate owners,' the official said.","Kremlin had claimed the soldiers were in the area on routine exercises .

"By . Brendan Carlin . Former Tory Shadow Minister Patrick Mercer could be the first MP in more than 60 years to be kicked out of the Commons without committing a criminal offence . Disgraced former Tory Shadow Minister Patrick Mercer could be the first MP in more than 60 years to be kicked out of the Commons without committing a criminal offence. Parliamentary standards watchdogs are now considering demanding his expulsion over ‘grave’ new allegations against him breaching Commons rules. The MP referred himself to the Commons standards committee after he was caught up in a cash-for-questions probe last year. Newark MP Mr Mercer was accused of agreeing to set up  a parliamentary group at the request of undercover reporters posing as lobbyists aiming to lift Fiji’s suspension from the Commonwealth. He was covertly filmed appearing to offer a Commons security pass to a fake firm that paid him thousands of pounds to ask parliamentary questions even though Commons rules ban MPs from undertaking such ‘paid advocacy’. Until last week, Mr Mercer was expected to be suspended from the Commons for up to six months in line with punishment already handed out to Labour peers caught in a separate lobbying sting. But Commons sources last night claimed that new evidence had now been unearthed which could lead to him being kicked out. One said: ‘It’s very serious and all options are now being considered.’ The Mail on Sunday understands the allegations relate to misuse of the portcullis symbol of the Houses of Parliament. The Commons standards committee is due to hand down its judgment on Mr Mercer after Parliament’s Easter recess – although any demand for expulsion will have to be voted on by the Commons as a whole. He would be the first  MP in 67 years to be expelled from the Commons without having committed a criminal offence. In 1947, Labour’s Garry Allighan was ejected after accusing colleagues of offering private parliamentary information to newspapers for cash while doing it himself. A former Army colonel with a distinguished military record, Mr Mercer entered the Commons in 2001 and served as Shadow Minister for Homeland Security. The MP may be kicked out of the Commons in light of new evidence, sources revealed last night . In 2007, David Cameron sacked him for an interview in which he suggested that being called a ‘black b*****d’ was a normal part of Army life. Since then he has been an outspoken critic of the PM. But the expulsion would present the Tories with a potentially disastrous by-election in an area where UKIP could pick up its first Westminster seat. Mr Mercer last night said  he had co-operated ‘fully’ with the inquiry but declined to comment further.","Watchdog considering Patrick Mercer's expulsion over 'grave' new claims .

"By . Ian Ladyman . Follow @@Ian_Ladyman_DM . Are Manchester United right to sack David Moyes . David Moyes will be sacked by Manchester United after the owners, the Glazer family, finally lost patience with the club’s dismal season. United are confident of landing Holland coach Louis van Gaal as his replacement once they have tied up details of their manager’s severance. The Barclays Premier League champions have already made contact with the Dutchman and he wants to join United after the World Cup. The Old Trafford board planned to sack . Moyes — just a year into a six-year contract — at the end of the season . but will now bring forward that announcement after news of their . intentions was reported by MailOnline on Monday afternoon. End of the line: David Moyes will be sacked by Manchester United and could leave before the end of the season . Under pressure: United crashed to a 2-0 defeat at Moyes's former club Everton on Sunday, their 11th defeat of the Premier League season . Searching for inspiration: Moyes has found it impossible to maintain the high standards set by predecessor Sir Alex Ferguson . Bright beginnings: Moyes started work at Old Trafford on July 1 last summer, having been announced as Ferguson's replacement in May . Played 51Won 27Drawn 9Lost 15Win percentage 52.94 . Moyes, on a day off on Monday, had still not been contacted by the club on Monday night and is understood to be hurt and angry after learning of his fate on newspaper websites. He will attend trainingat Carrington today but may well not survive the week. Player-coach Ryan Giggs is lined up to replace him until the end of the season, alongside fellow Treble winner Nicky Butt, as United try to salvage some pride by finishing in the Europa League places at least. Sir Alex Ferguson, who appointed Moyes, is expected to have little or no say in who the next manager will be. News of the 50-year-old’s imminent departure broke on Monday in the wake of Sunday’s defeat at his old club Everton. However, it is understood the club decided to look for alternatives after the 2-0 reverse in the Champions League at Olympiacos in February. Meet the new boss: Moyes gets to work on his first morning as United manager at the club's Carrington training complex . Backing: Supporters on the Stretford End commissioned a banner proclaiming Moyes as the 'Chosen One' Good start: Moyes lifts the Community Shield after United beat Wigan 2-0 at Wembley back in August. It will be his only piece of silverware with the club . Winning start: United won 4-1 at Swansea City on the opening day of the season, getting their title defence off to the perfect start . Warm reception: Moyes is introduced to the Old Trafford crowd prior to his first home game against Chelsea . April 26 Norwich City (H)May 3 Sunderland (H)May 6 Hull City (H)May 11 Southampton (A) The Glazers, who are due in Manchester next week, had been supportive of Moyes but have sensed since the turn of the year that results and performances were getting worse and that some of United’s senior stars had simply stopped playing for their manager. They want to appoint a new manager — preferably Van Gaal — as soon as possible so they can tie up deals for players including . Southampton’s Luke Shaw before the World Cup. United know that it will be hard enough to attract players this summer without Champions League football and didn’t want to continue the negotiating process with a manager who had become a lame duck. Certainly not many United players will be disappointed to hear the news. Even those who like Moyes realised that things were not working, an impression that hardened when the Scot walked into the dressing room at Goodison Park on Sunday afternoon and told his team they had played well. Taste of defeat: Moyes suffered his first league loss at Anfield as a Daniel Sturridge gave Liverpool a 1-0 win on September 1 . Down to work: Moyes leads a training session at Carrington ahead of his first Champions League match with United back in September . Euro stars: United beat Bayer Leverkusen 4-2 at Old Trafford in their opening Champions League fixture of the season . Nightmare: The scale of Moyes's task at Old Trafford became apparent in the 4-1 defeat at rivals Manchester City on September 24 . Bad to worse: Moyes can't believe his misfortune as United are beaten at home by West Bromwich on September 28 . If talks with Van Gaal don’t work out as expected, United will consider alternative targets such as Dortmund’s Jurgen Klopp and Real Madrid’s Carlo Ancelotti. At 62, Van Gaal is a relatively old manager, but after the experiment with Moyes, United are aware they need a coach with the presence and the experience to cope with a club of their size and profile. United old boy Phil Neville may survive the backroom cull, as may goalkeeping coach Chris Woods after his exceptional work with David de Gea this season. Masterstroke: Moyes did persuade star striker Wayne Rooney to turn down the overtures of Chelsea and sign a new contract . Revenge: United knocked Liverpool out of the Capital One Cup at the third round stage, offering swift retribution for the Anfield loss . Passion play: Moyes celebrates Javier Hernandez's goal as United beat Stoke City 3-2 at Old Trafford .

Race is on: Moyes runs along the touchline to retrieve the ball during United's New Year's Day loss to Tottenham . Protest: Moyes runs on to the pitch to appeal after a blatant handball is not given in the Tottenham match . No luck: Moyes rues a missed chance as United slipped to a 2-1 defeat to Sunderland in the first leg of their Capital One Cup semi-final . Out: With coach Phil Neville after United were knocked out of the Capital One Cup on penalties by Sunderland . January sales: Moyes bought Juan Mata from Chelsea for £37m in a bid to revive the flagging season . Nadir: United produced their most miserable performance of the season as they were beaten 2-0 by Olympiacos in the first leg of their last 16 Champions League tie . The great turnaround: But a Robin van Persie hat-trick gave United a 3-0 win at Old Trafford and took them through to a last eight encounter with Bayern Munich . Anger: A fan remonstrates with Moyes during the 3-0 home defeat by Manchester City . Guarded: Stewards protect the 'Chosen one' banner on the Stretford End at the end of the City defeat . Stunt: Disgruntled United fans paid for this plane to fly over the ground during a home match with Aston Villa. The plane's appearance was roundly booed by United fans in the ground . Good display: United produced their best performance of the season in the 1-1 home draw with Bayern Munich . Beyond them: But Bayern came from behind in the second leg in Munich to win 3-1 and knock United out of the Champions League .

"By . Bianca London . Traditional gun salutes marked the Queen's 88th birthday today - but the royal herself was notably absent. Instead, she is spending the day privately at Windsor Castle, a Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said. The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery fired a 41-gun royal salute from Green Park in central London at midday, using six 13lb First World War guns drawn by 71 horses. Scroll down for video . Dramatic scenes: Soldiers from the Honourable Artillery Company fire a 62 round royal gun salute to celebrate the 88th birthday of Queen Elizabeth II at the Tower of London in central London . An hour later the Honourable Artillery Company fired a 62-gun royal salute from Tower Wharf by the Tower of London. Before the King's Troop arrived in Green Park, the Band of the Honourable Artillery Company and Royal Yeomanry played a selection of celebratory music close to the firing position. Princess Elizabeth Alexandra Mary was born at 2.40am on April 21 1926 - the first child of the then Duke and Duchess of York - at 17 Bruton Street, the Mayfair home of her mother's parents, the Earl and Countess of Strathmore. She is the great-great-grandchild of Queen Victoria, the last female sovereign. The Queen has two birthdays, her actual one today and her official one in June, which is celebrated with the Trooping the Colour parade. Make some noise! The Bands of The Honourable Artillery Company and The Royal Yeomanry perform prior to The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery, the ceremonial saluting battery of the Household Division, firing a 41 Gun Royal Salute in Green Park .

Tradition: The Royal salute was to mark the birthday of Princess Elizabeth Alexandra Mary, who was born at 2.40am on April 21 1926 - the first child of the then Duke and Duchess of York . A portrait of the Queen by the renowned British photographer David Bailey was released yesterday ahead of her 88th birthday. The photograph of the monarch, smiling, was taken at Buckingham Palace in March and commissioned on behalf of the Government's GREAT Britain campaign. The Queen is wearing pearls and a dress by Angela Kelly, who has served as her personal assistant and senior dresser since 2002. Preparations: Soldiers from the Honourable Artillery Company prepare to fire a 62 round royal gun salute to celebrate her 88th birthday . Quiet day: Instead of watching the salute, the Queen is spending the day privately at Windsor Castle, a Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said . Meanwhile, the Queen's Awards for Enterprise, which are designed to recognise and encourage the achievements by businesses in the UK in the fields of innovation, international trade and sustainable development, were also held today. The awards are made annually by Her Majesty The Queen and are only given for the highest levels of excellence demonstrated in each category. Belfast headquartered self-tanning brand, Vita Liberata, which is loved by Gwyneth Paltrow and Ellie Goulding, was recognised with The Queen's Award for Enterprise in International Trade. Vita Liberata, an organic and odorless tanning brand, was commended for its overseas sales growth of over 400 per cent between 2011 and 2013, whilst tripling its headcount and opening operations in the United States. Founder and CEO Alyson Hogg established Vita Liberata in 2003 with a desire to create innovative skincare and tanning that delivered natural, high-quality results. Scenic: The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery, the ceremonial saluting battery of the Household Division, fired a 41 Gun Royal Salute in Green Park at midday, the same day that the Queen's Awards for Enterprise were announced . Big day: As well as the ceremonial saluting battery of the Household Division, the Queen's Enterprise awards, which are made annually by Her Majesty The Queen and are only given for the highest levels of excellence demonstrated in each category, were awarded . Alyson Hogg said: 'The Queen's Award is a recognition of the dynamic, creative, tenacious and incredibly smart team of (mostly) young women that work with us across 24 time zones and as many countries. It is even more remarkable when you consider that global operations are run from the small market town of Ballyclare in Northern Ireland. 'We have been fortunate to partner with some of the strongest retailers in our sector, who recognise both the amazing quality of our products, and the ability of our team to deliver on our joint goals. This award recognises our team, our product and our determination to bring what we make to a world stage. It is a wonderful accolade. We are very proud indeed!.' An arms firm that has developed an air-launch missile suitable for firing in urban environments was also amongst the 160 winners, as was G Fresh Beetroot (a company that makes vegetable steaming and storing utensils) and a designer of 3D games, Axis Productions. Crowds: While scores of locals stopped by to witness the dramatic scenes, the Queen was spending the day privately . MDMA, a Hertfordshire-based weapons company, won an innovation award for converting the Brimstone anti-armour missile into a dual purpose weapon that can be used by crews flying RAF Tornado jets. Cambridge-based G Fresh Beetroot was commended for creating a way of steaming vegetables and storing them without using artificial preservatives. Glasgow-based Axis Productions, behind some of the best-selling games around, such as Halo and Need for Speed, won an award for its outstanding growth. Winners each receive a grant of appointment, which they can use in advertising marketing and packaging for five years, a presentational item and an invitation from HM The Queen to a reception at Buckingham Palace in July.

"By . Chris Pleasance . Jason Scotland-Williams, 34, completed the marathon in just over three hours - knocking more than four hours off his time last year of seven hours 24 minutes . A London Marathon runner - who apparently completed the second half of the race quicker than Olympic champion Mo Farah - has denied claims he cheated. Jason Scotland-Williams, 34, was accused of duping race officials yesterday after it emerged he completed the second leg of the marathon in just one hour, one minute - three minutes shy of the world record. But the personal trainer has defended the result, saying: 'I have done nothing wrong. This was my sixth London marathon. 'I'm a personal trainer. I train every day, seven days a week for the past seven years. Nobody thinks maybe I just trained hard. Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph, he added: 'Nobody thinks ""maybe he paced himself through the first half and when the second half came he just let himself go.""' Mr Scotland-Williams, 34, completed this year’s marathon in a total of three hours eight minutes - knocking more than four hours off his last time of seven hours 24 minutes. The aspiring model, from Hammersmith, London, ran the first half of the marathon in two hours and seven minutes – an average time for an amateur athlete. However, he apparently ran the second half of the race in just one hour and one minute – quicker than Olympic hero Mo Farah who completed the same stretch in one hour and five minutes. It means Scotland-Williams finished the race in an impressive three hours and eight minutes – putting him in the top six per cent of competitors. However, online forums are awash with claims the runner cheated his way to the super-fast time, with some speculating he jumped over a waist-high barrier at the halfway point at Tower Bridge. It is alleged he jumped the barrier separating the 13-mile marker from the 22-mile point and hid in the crowds while runners looped round Canary Wharf and doubled back. It is claimed he then jumped back into the race, joining a leading group of runners, and sprinted his way to the finish. Jason Scotland-Williams, 34, above, from Hammersmith, London, faces claims he cheated after completing the second half of the marathon in one hour and one minute - quicker than Olympic champion Mo Farah . London Marathon organisers are investigating Jason Scotland-Williams' time after he ran the second half of the race in just over an hour. Internet forums are awash with claims he jumped over a barrier in the Tower Bridge area . Jason Scotland-Williams' result suggests he ran the second half of the race in just one hour and one minute – quicker than Olympic champion Mo Farah, above,  who completed the same stretch in one hour five minutes . The . official London Marathon website logs his progress around the first half . of the course, giving updates for every 5kms he completed. However, . it only gives estimated times at the 25km, 30km and 35km markers – . which has prompted critics to believe he either cheated his way to the . finish by dodging those checkpoints or that his chip failed to activate . at those points. However, his chip was working as he passed the 40km point and the finish line – which reveals he completed the last 13 miles in just one hour and one minute. The allegations come as BBC new presenter Sophie Raworth revealed she was stopped by 'jobsworth' officials 400 yards from the finish line and  wrongly accused of cheating. Writing on Twitter, Raworth said she had to push past a female official close to Buckingham Palace after she was stopped and accused of having a fake number. BBC news presenter Sophie Raworth, who completed the marathon in three hours 48 minutes, complained of being wrongly stopped by an official along with fellow runner Eliot Fineberg . Responding to her tweet, Eliot Fineberg, who was running the marathon to raise money for charity, claimed to have been stopped by the same official for seven minutes. Eliot says the woman also accused him of having a fake number, adding that she could tell 'by the look in your eye' that he was lying. When he also tried to give her the brush-off, the official threatened to call the police. Eliot says he had to wait seven minutes while two other officials were called over to check the number, which turned out to be legitimate. He said he was 'gutted' at being held up after training for six months for his first marathon. Scotland-Williams had posted numerous photos on his Facebook profile of him wearing his marathon medals and showing off his supposed athletic ability. However, the page was closed down this morning . Results on the London Marathon's official website show Jason Scotland-Williams completed the race in three hours eight minutes. However, they also show estimated times were given at the 25K, 30K and 35K markers . Elsewhere, forum users have questioned Mr Scotland-Williams . speedy time, suggesting it would have been a ‘miracle’ if he managed to . complete the second half of the race in such a short space of time. One . user, Chris Pearson, posted on a forum on Runners World: ‘First half . seems fair enough.  Second half is nothing short of a miracle. ‘It is possible that he ran easy for the first half, then went all out in the second half. ‘However, it would need a chip malfunction at 25, 30, and 35k for this to have happened. ‘It . would also mean that he is capable of running a half at just over 60 . minute pace, which again is possible if he was a World class elite . runner, but certainly not after doing a 13.1 mile warm up.’ Another user, Millsy1977 - a fellow marathon runner - said: ‘If it was legit he would have sped past me on Birdcage walk. I know I was tired but I think I'd have noticed someone 4.30 miling.’ Another marathon runner, Darryl Morris, said: ‘I saw Jason just after Tower Bridge and he was absolutely smashing it’, before adding: ‘Just noted the barrier skip … that would make complete sense as to why I saw him there, looking so fresh!’ And Ryan T said: ‘If he did cheat then I think a ban is in order, I worked very hard for my time this year, did a sub 3:30 for my first marathon and went through a lot of pain in the last three miles, if people are skipping out miles then shame on them!’ Virgin Money London Marathon confirmed Scotland-Williams’ results were being investigated. A spokesman told The Sun: ‘We have anti-cheating measures during the event, and then post-event when we analyse split times from points around the course. ‘Runners found to have cheated are removed from results and banned from future events.’ Jason Scotland-Williams, 34, completed this year's marathon in just over three hours - knocking more than four hours off his time last year of seven hours 24 minutes . Scotland-Williams, who wore a V for Vendetta mask during last weekend’s race, has taken part in the London Marathon for the last six years. He had posted numerous photos on his Facebook profile of him wearing his marathon medals and showing off his supposed athletic ability. However, his profile was removed from the social-networking site this morning. This year he was running to raise money for deaf-blind charity Sense. A spokesman for the charity said: ‘An allegation that a runner cheated at the London Marathon has been brought to our attention. ‘We are urgently investigating and would be very disappointed if this was true.’ The Sun reported it tried to contact Scotland-Williams but was told to ‘f*** off’. MailOnline has contacted Virgin Money London Marathon for a comment but organisers have not yet responded. Anthony Gaskell was stripped of his 'fastest pensioner' title after admitting that he took a short cut during the 2010 London Marathon . Jason Stockland-Williams is not the first competitor to be accused of cheating in the London Marathon. In 2010, Anthony Gaskell, 69, crossed the finishing line in a mere three hours and five minutes – throwing himself into the record books as the fastest time ever recorded by anyone over 65. He was due to receive a plaque marking his achievement until analysis of the race revealed he must have completed the second half in under an hour - a pace that even the world record holder could not match. Six weeks after the event, Mr Gaskell was stripped of his 'fastest pensioner' title after admitting that he took a short cut. He used a part of the course just after Tower Bridge - where the marathon doubles back on itself - to cut from the outward leg to the home leg, taking around ten miles off the course. At the time, the grandfather from Wirral, Merseyside, said: 'I have been called a cheat and disqualified from a race I never claimed to have won.' He claimed he was injured after falling over a runner ahead of him who had tripped on a safety barrier and said: 'I couldn't possibly continue.' He insists he never claimed to have run the last part of the course and that he did not try to pass off the winning time as his own. In 2011, a runner was disqualified from the 20-mile Kielder Marathon in Northumberland after catching a bus for the most of the last six miles. Rob Sloan flagged down a bus and was driven the six miles to the race’s closing stages. Rob Sloan was disqualified from the 20-mile Kielder Marathon in Northumberland in 2011 after catching a bus for most of the last six miles . He then jumped off, hid behind a tree until other competitors came into view and re-joined the race, crossing the finishing line in two hours, 51 minutes and one second to secure third place. He went on to tell a TV crew that he had given the race everything he could. However, inevitably, the truth came out and Mr Sloan was stripped of his medal and disqualified from the race.

"By . Steph Cockroft . It is a British tradition that has brought joy to millions of families for more than 150 years. Now one of Britain's favourite dishes, fish and chips, has been voted as the country's greatest-ever double act. The meal polled above the likes of Posh and Becks and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in a survey of the top 50 British combinations. The survey asked 1,000 adults to choose their favourite British pairing, from areas such as comedy, music, food, business or sport. Winners!

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Chiming every 15 minutes for more than 100 years, the sound of the church clock is as familiar to the villagers of Wherwell as birdsong. But one resident finds it far from melodious, claiming he can’t manage to sleep through the noise. Chris Molden’s £1.5million home is just 100 yards from St Peter and Holy Cross church in the Hampshire village. For over 100 years the clock has chimed every fifteen minutes at Wherwell, near Andover, Hampshire, since it was installed to celebrate the . Coronation of George V . After he complained, the church provisionally agreed to turn off the quarter-hour chimes from 11pm to 7am. But it is adamant that the hourly chimes must stay – day and night. The tower clock, installed to celebrate the coronation of George V, has been out of action for a year. It was restored in time for yesterday’s Easter services with the help of a £9,000 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. Within minutes of the chimes ringing out, environmental health officers from the local council arrived to test the noise levels. Chris Molden's £1.5million home is just 100 yards from St Peter and Holy Cross church in the Hampshire village. He claims the bells are stopping him from sleeping . A spokesman said: ‘The complainant has requested it [the chimes] be switched off at night. We are deciding whether that is appropriate. That does not mean it is too noisy all the time.’ Yesterday, church warden Pam Prince said: ‘There has been this complaint put in and it has to be sorted. It would be nice if it could continue chiming all night. 'The village loves to hear it chiming. 'It would be nice if it could continue chiming . all night. The clock is working again and we are very pleased.” Parish council chairman Jane Andrews said: ‘It is sad when there is disagreement in a community. 'But if you buy an old rectory it is quite likely there will be an old clock that chimes.’ It is unclear how long Mr Molden has lived in the village. Yesterday he was away but his wife confirmed he had complained about the noise.","Chris Molden’s £1.5m home is just 100 yards from village church .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Julie Mannion, 45, was having a cigarette outside North Manchester General Hospital when she claims a security guard punched her in the face . A woman patient was knocked unconscious and suffered horrendous facial injuries when she was punched by a hospital security guard, it was claimed today. Police and hospital bosses are probing reports the security guard punched Julie Mannion in the face outside Manchester North General Hospitalâ€™s A&E department. Julie, 45, from Blackley, Greater Manchester, spent three days at Salford Royal and had to undergo an MRI scan after she says she was knocked unconscious. She had originally been taken to A&E at North Manchester shortly after midnight on Saturday, April 12, after banging the back of her head during an altercation at the Golden Lion pub near her home. The customer service adviser claims that while she was outside the unit having a cigarette the security guard punched her, leaving her with two black eyes. She says she left the hospital and went five miles away to Salford Royal casualty unit for treatment. Pennine Acute Trust, which runs the hospital, and its security contractors, Mitie, are holding a joint investigation. It is understood the incident was captured by hospital CCTV cameras and the security guard has been suspended. Greater Manchester Police are also investigating but no arrests have been made. Julie says she has been left terrified by the ordeal. She said: 'It came from nowhere. He just came and punched me full in the face. I was knocked out for a few seconds. Ms Mannion was initially admitted after banging the back of her head in an altercation in a pub near her home . After she was punched, Ms Mannion went to another hospital, Salford Royal, for treatment on her face . 'Itâ€™s made me very nervous now, particularly around security guards and people in uniform.' It is understood hospital bosses have been told Julie and her boyfriend had been involved in an argument with the guard who was escorting the man from the premises. A spokesman for Pennice Acute Trust said: 'A hospital security officer was carrying out his duties when this incident occurred. 'Regretfully, a patient suffered an injury. The police attended and dealt with the incident.' Penine Acute Trust, which runs the hospital, is investigating.

"By . Sam Webb . Stoic: Teenager Jessica Bradford who was told she had a sexually transmitted disease after doctors said she was too young to have cervical cancer . A teenager was told by doctors she had a sexually-transmitted infection - only to later find out she had cervical cancer. Hairdresser Jessica Bradford, 18, feared she had cervical cancer after looking up her symptoms online - but her doctors said she was too young. But tests showed she had the disease - and she has been told she will never have children due to the radiotherapy treatment she is receiving. Her mother Julie, 42, said: 'Jessica had some bleeding and other symptoms so she went to see the doctor straight away. 'At first they thought it was thrush and gave antibiotics, then they said it was a bacterial infection. 'After that they thought it was a sexually transmitted disease. 'She went back to the doctors about five times. They thought it couldn't be cervical cancer because of her age.' But after a series of tests, scans and biopsies doctors confirmed the teenager's worst fears. Jessica is one of the youngest women in Britain to be diagnosed with cervical cancer - women are not normally scanned for it until they are at least 20. But Jessica and her mum, also a hairdresser, are now campaigning for the age to be lowered in the hope that other teenagers could be diagnosed early. Brave Jessica is juggling a college hairdressing course with her cancer treatment at a specialist hospital. She is doing well but was left heartbroken when doctors said the treatment had left her infertile. Mum-of-three Julie said: 'She has been so upset about that because she loves children. 'But having radiotherapy destroys the womb so it has completely ended her chances of having children.' The 18-year-old hairdresser from Rhymney, South Wales, pictured with mother Julie, is now fighting the disease . Jessica is continuing to go to hairdressing college during her five-week course of radiotherapy and chemotherapy at Velindre Hospital in Cardiff. Julie said: 'Jessica is strong minded and she is positive. I am really proud of her.' Jessica said: 'I am determined to get through this, finish my studies and open up my own hair salon. ""But my other goal is to raise awareness about the importance of spotting symptoms and going to see a doctor early. I also think they should reduce the age for smear tests to 18.' 'My advice is just go to see a doctor soon as you get the symptoms and don't stop until they give you a definite answer.'

"By . Scarlett Russell . Soaring childcare costs in the UK are prompting more mothers than ever to start their own businesses from home. A new survey has found that two thirds (65 per cent) of mothers with children under the age of ten are considering launching their own business in the next three years. The dramatic rise in childcare costs mean that the annual expense of full-time childcare is £11,700 for two children. Working mothers: 49 per cent of mothers questioned in a new survey believe that they would be financially better off if they started a business from home . The research, by insurers Direct Line, found that nearly half of mothers questioned - 49 per cent - believe that they would be financially better off if they started a business from home. One in five British mothers say they (20 per cent) also believe they'd be able to spend more time with their children if they didn't have to go in to an office every day. One in six (16 per cent) think they'd save money on childcare if they eschew traditional nine-to-five, office-based jobs. One in seven mums (14 per cent) are motivated to start a business from home by the flexibility of being their own boss. One in eight (12 per cent) have always had the ambition to start their own business. Only one per cent is motivated by the fact that they do not like their current job. Jazz Gakhal, Head of Direct Line for . Business, said: 'The costs of sending a child to day care, or hiring . a nanny continue to spiral. 'It’s great to see that mums are tackling . this problem with such an entrepreneurial spirit, as they understand . considerable child care cost savings can be made by running a business . from home.' Kerry Marriott, 37, and Rachael Forder, 42, from Southsea, Hampshire, used their mothering skills to think up a lucrative business and, in 2012, successfully launched the LumiPotti: a potty which lights up to help young children with toilet training. They thought of the idea when they realised their own youngsters were finding it difficult to locate the toilet in the dark. 'Rachael used a transparent potty with a night light underneath and I plugged a night light in to the wall nearby,' Kerry told Mail Online. 'Our children liked the idea that they could get up and find the potty on their own at night. They were quite proud of themselves. 'It wasn’t 100 per cent fool proof but it proved really effective. We started telling other parents about the method and they said it had worked for them.' The LumiPotti successfully sells online and the women hope to make it a 'global brand.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Losing interest in hobbies and other activities in old age could be an early sign of dementia, say scientists. A US study found that elderly people who were apathetic but not suffering depression had shrinking amounts of grey and white matter – neurons in the brain that control memory and communication respectively. Researchers say the findings offer doctors a new tool with which to identify a group of the population at risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. The study has shown that patients suffering from Alzheimer's Disease lose interest in their hobbies which can be an early indicator of the condition (stock photo) Researchers gave MRI scans to 4,354 people with an average age of 74 as part of the study . People with two or more symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease had on average 1.4 percent grey matter in their brain compared with healthy people . Dr Lenore Launer, of the National Institutes of Health in Maryland, said: ‘Just as signs of memory loss may signal brain changes related to brain disease, apathy may indicate underlying changes. ‘Apathy symptoms are common in older people without dementia. And the fact participants in our study had apathy without depression should turn our attention to how apathy alone could indicate brain disease.’ The researchers used brain volume as a measure of accelerated brain ageing. Neuron losses occur during normal  ageing but larger ones could indicate brain diseases. In the study, 4,354 people without dementia and with an average age of 76 underwent an MRI scan. They were also asked questions that measure apathy symptoms which include lack of interest, lack of emotion, dropping activities and interests and preferring to stay at home, and having a lack of energy. Researchers found that apathy was a common complaint among patients with Alzheimer's Disease . People with two or more symptoms had 1.4 per cent less grey matter and 1.6 per cent less white matter compared to those who had fewer. Grey matter is where learning takes place and memories are stored in the brain. White matter acts as the communication cables that connect different parts of the brain. Dr Launer said: ‘If these findings are confirmed, identifying people with  apathy earlier may be one way to  target an at-risk group.’ The study is published online in Neurology – the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.","New study shows that patients with Alzheimer's have less grey matter than healthy people .

"By . Ben Spencer . Smoking cannabis casually just one or two times a week can damage core structures of the brain, a study found (library image) Smoking cannabis even casually can damage core structures of the brain,  an authoritative study  has found. Just using the drug once or twice a week affects the  size and shape of two key  brain regions involved in emotion and motivation, the research shows. Previous studies have focused on heavy users of cannabis – revealing that the active compound in the drug effectively ‘rewires’ the brain. But this is the first study that has revealed the impact of casual marijuana use. The scientists, from Harvard Medical School and Northwestern University in Chicago, analysed MRI brain scans of 20 young cannabis users aged 18 to 25. They compared them to the brain scans 20 young people who never smoked the drug. Professor Hans Breiter, one of the researchers from Northwestern University said: ‘This study raises a strong challenge to the idea that casual marijuana use  is not associated with bad consequences.’ The scientists found major differences in two brain areas, the nucleus accumbens and amygdala. Both are linked to emotions and motivation, and also associated with addiction. In each case changes were seen that were directly related to how much cannabis was smoked. The nucleus accumbens of cannabis users was unusually large, while the amygdala was deformed. Professor Breiter said: ‘Some of these people only used marijuana to get high once or twice a week. ‘People think a little recreational use shouldn’t cause a problem, if someone is doing OK with work or school. Our data directly says this is not the case.’ Co-author Dr Anne Blood, from Harvard, said: ‘These are core, fundamental structures of the brain. They form the basis for how you assess positive and negative features about things in the environment and make decisions about them.’ The drug users in the study smoked cannabis at least once a week but were not psychologically dependent on their habit. The scientists, whose findings are reported in the Journal of  Neuroscience, believe the effects are the result of users’ brains adapting to low-level exposure  to cannabis. Previous research has shown that rats given the psychoactive compound in cannabis, THC, effectively have their brains rewired. Psychologist Dr Jodie Gilman, who led the latest study, said: ‘It may be that we’re seeing a type of drug learning in the brain. Casual use of the drug affects the size and shape of two key brain regions involved in emotion and motivation, scientists found. The study was the first to look solely at those using cannabis irregularly . ‘We think when people are in the process of becoming addicted, their brains form these new connections.’ Drug addiction expert Dr Carl Lupica, from the United State  National Institute on Drug Abuse, added: ‘This study  suggests that even light to moderate recreational marijuana use can cause changes in  brain anatomy. ‘These observations are particularly interesting because previous studies have focused primarily on the brains of heavy marijuana smokers.’ Dr Michael Bloomfield, of the UK Medical Research Council, said: ‘It’s been known for some time that heavy cannabis use can affect the brain. ‘This new, well-conducted study has some really interesting and important results because it suggests that even moderate use of cannabis in young adults may be  associated with changes  in the brain.’ He said the study would inform separate scientific research that looks at the links between mental illness and  cannabis use. He added: ‘Taken together, these studies therefore have implications for understanding some of the mental health problems that are associated with cannabis use including schizophrenia, particularly as the younger people are when they use start using cannabis, the higher the risk of mental illnesses down the line.’ Professor Peter Jones, professor of psychiatry at the University of Cambridge, said: ‘This is an interesting piece of research. However, it is limited as it is only a small study. The main point is that, as usual, more research is needed.’","Using drug once or twice a week affects core structures of the brain .

"By . Associated Press . MariePaule Vermersch, the woman who, with her parents, first introduced the now famous Belgian waffle to the U.S. at New York's World's Fair in 1964, has detailed how the fluffy breakfast treat fast became a culinary sensation. 'From the moment we opened there was a . line. We couldn't see the end,' recalls Ms Vermersch, 66, who . helped her parents serve an average of 2,500 waffles a day during the . fair, which opened on April 22, 1964. 'It was wild.' The Belgian family, who served their waffles topped with fresh whipped cream, powdered sugar and sliced strawberries, touted their creation as a 'light, crispy and fluffy' alternative to the American variety. Fluffy delights: Belgian Waffles were introduced to the American public at the 1964 World fair (pictured) by Belgians Maurice and Rose Vermersch and their daughter MariePaule . The Vermersches first served the treat . two years earlier at the 1962 World's Fair in Seattle, and for years . after they made the waffles at the annual New York State Fair in . Syracuse. But it was at the 1964 event in New York City that the waffles became a sensation. According to Ms Vermersch, they were supposed to be called Brussels . waffles â€” named for the Belgian capital, where they were a specialty â€” but her mother Rose soon realized many Americans didn't know where Brussels . was. To this day, baby boomers . fondly recall the memory of enjoying them at the fair. Where it all began: The actual pitcher and waffle iron (pictured) used to make the now famous waffles, sit on a table in the Vermersch family home in Queens, New York . Ms Vermersch said that for years she ran a . coffee shop, MariePaule's Authentic Belgian Waffles, in her current . home of Albuquerque, New Mexico, that featured a picture of the 1964 . World's Fair. 'People would . look at the name and see the picture and say, ""I ate those waffles at . the World's Fair,"" and they'd pick up the phone and call their parents,' said Ms Vermersch, who is in New York to attend the fair's 50th . anniversary celebration this month, and also to care for her 95-year-old . mother, who lives in Queens. 'I couldn't believe how often that would . happen.' What made the waffles so good? Ms Vermersch cites a special cast-iron pan that heats up to 500 degrees. Family ties: Rose Vermersch, 95, (left) and her daughter, MariePaule, 66, (right) pose for a photo in their home, 50 years after they introduced Belgian waffles to America .

"By . Elizabeth Sanderson . Olympic champion swimmer Rebecca Adlington understands the undesirable side of fame, having been subjected to endless abuse about the way she looks . If anyone understands the undesirable side of fame, it is swimmer Rebecca Adlington. She might be a four-time Olympic medallist but, for as long as she has been feted for her sporting achievements, she has also been subject to endless abuse over the way she looks. One comedian compared the swimmer to a dolphin, while Twitter trolls attacked her about her weight, her nose and for simply not being pretty enough. For a girl who has admitted to hating her appearance it must have been devastating. Worse, when it became apparent earlier this year that Rebecca had undergone surgery to have her nose reduced and bump removed, it became a national talking point as to whether she should or shouldn’t have given in to the cyber bullies. Little wonder she’s so far refused to confirm or deny the reports she did indeed undergo surgery. Sitting opposite her, there’s no doubt that Rebecca, 25, looks different: leaner, more polished and, yes, with a more streamlined nose. And it’s not just outwardly she has changed. Adlington, who retired from competitive swimming after the London Olympics, has also developed a greater inner confidence. Speaking for the first time about ‘the nose job’, Rebecca is emphatic in insisting that it is nobody’s business but her own. ‘If somebody else wants to know [that], well tough luck,’ she says with a toss of her long blonde hair. ‘It’s my life. Loads of women have loads of things that they do – like a Kim Kardashian or whatever – but  I just think if you open yourself  up in that way, there’s a lot more that happens. ‘I’ve never opened the door in that way. I never set out to be in the  spotlight. I’ve fallen into it by  doing something that I love, that is my passion.’ Having this attitude meant that when the online attacks began, it was all the harder to bear. The youngest of Mansfield businessman Steve Adlington and his wife Kay’s three daughters, Rebecca had no idea of the shocking vitriol that would be levelled at her after she won two gold medals at the Beijing Olympics in 2008. Rebecca explains: ‘Obviously, being a swimmer, you never think you’re going to get any sort of profile, so I didn’t know what fame was. I didn’t expect it. 'The thing that I found very difficult when it all started happening after Beijing was that people were commenting on something that I just didn’t understand – on the way I look – and I thought, “What’s that got to do with swimming?” So that hit me. ‘I also thought, well I’m trying to represent my country and you should be wanting to help everyone – all the British team get behind each other. 'At first it definitely upset me. I’d burst into tears when I first started reading things but as I’ve grown up I’ve learnt to think, you know what, I don’t know them, they’ve never seen me in real life, they’ve never spoken to me. 'At first it definitely upset me. I'd burst into tears when I first started reading things but as I've grown up I've learnt to think, you know what, I don't know them, they've never seen me in real life' ‘You’ve got to be a certain kind of person to sit there, make the effort to find somebody, to write them a nasty message . . . You know what? Just block them out of your mind.’ In reality, it’s not as simple as all that. The path of a young and newly retired athlete is not always easy but Rebecca is now carving out a successful TV career. During her appearance on I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here, she regularly broke down in tears after comparing herself unfavourably to fellow contestant Amy Willerton, a beauty queen of not inconsiderable assets. But Rebecca is now on the panel of ITV’s chatshow Loose Women – where she is sparky and forthright – and will also soon appear on Through The Keyhole. She and her fiance, Harry Needs, a professional swimmer three years her junior (he used to have her poster on his wall), are getting married in August. They have a comfortable home in Stockport, Greater Manchester, and want to have children one day. Life is good yet Rebecca admits that on occasions she can’t resist looking at Twitter. Before and after: Rebecca pictured left, before her plastic surgery, and right, showing off the results of the op . ‘I sit there at eight o’clock at night and Harry’s saying, “Bec, why are you checking Twitter? You’re allowing them into our home.” ‘I’d never thought of it that way.  You’re sat there in your home, which is your comfort zone, and yet you’re reading comments from other people and allowing them in. I thought yes, you’re right. Why am I doing this? I’ve tried to stop it now... although I do it if Harry’s out.’ The nastiness has died down but, according to Rebecca, that doesn’t necessarily mean the Twittersphere has changed. ‘It’s only because I’ve blocked them all [the trolls],’ she says with a hearty laugh. ‘I must have blocked about 4,000 people. I actually Googled it the other day to see if there’s any way I can find out how many people I’ve done it to. ‘Maybe it’s not 4,000, but I must have blocked at least 2,000 people.  In a day I’ve blocked 100, 200 people, if something’s happened. But to be fair it’s calmed down a lot.’ 'I'm definitely happier with how I look now... But I wouldn't necessarily say happy. I think you still always see the same thing when you look in the mirror' Still, she’s obviously taken the bullying to heart. Rebecca recently launched a campaign, run by Legal & General, to find out what advice the nation would give to their younger selves to make their lives better. She says she would tell her teenage self not to let strangers affect the way she feels about herself. In the flesh, the swimmer looks much prettier ... and it’s not just because of the smoother nose. Yet she still struggles with her insecurities. ‘I’m definitely happier with how I look now,’ she says. ‘But I wouldn’t necessarily say happy. I think you still always see the same thing when you look in the mirror. A lot of people tell me that you get more comfortable with yourself with age and obviously I’ve still got a lot of growing up to do. ‘But I will never have this figure that’s big-boobed and tiny waist and curvaceous bum. I know I have got slightly bigger shoulders than some people and an average cup size, that’s not going to change.’ When she was swimming Rebecca needed to consume up to 3,500 calories a day. She would eat six Weetabix for breakfast, four sandwiches for lunch, a huge spaghetti bolognese in the evenings as well as constantly snacking. When she stopped swimming, perhaps inevitably, the weight piled on. Rebecca added: 'You do get down but now I¿ve learnt only to listen to the people I know, whose opinion I value' The former athlete lost most of the weight when she was on I’m A Celebrity and hasn’t put anything back on since. She reveals the only diet she does is the Jason Vale five- day juice diet, which seems pretty extreme, but she insists she has a healthy attitude to food. ‘I’m sensible. I have a glass of wine with a meal now I’ve retired although I’ve only just started getting into it. I like white wine but I can’t get into red. I’m not there yet. It tastes like vinegar. My mum keeps saying to me, “Trust me, it will come.”' At the London Olympics, Rebecca won two bronze medals, making her Britain’s most decorated female Olympian alongside the rower Katherine Grainger, but she admits she grew to dread race days. Rebecca says: ‘I hated waking up and feeling so sick with nerves, it was unbelievable. 'And that whole four-hour period or whatever it was leading up to a race where you literally can’t eat anything and your emotions are going crazy because you’re so nervous. ‘In most other sports you have your season with lots of big competitions. Like footballers who have a match every weekend. 'We only competed twice a year. It was very difficult going into a race that you’ve trained 90 per cent of the year for that lasted four minutes. All of that for a four-minute race. 'That’s what I found difficult. Afterwards, you feel so frazzled, it’s like someone’s just electrocuted your brain.’ By comparison she loves her new career on TV, and loves appearing on Loose Women. ‘I really enjoy it. And I’m pretty all right at holding my own,’ she says. ‘For a long time it [the Twitter abuse] was something I found difficult to deal with. ‘You do get down but now I’ve learnt only to listen to the people I know, whose opinion I value.’","Four-time Olympic medalist has been subjected to abuse about her looks .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . In the world of online shopping, customer reviews can make or break a sale – but not in the way you might expect. A new U.S. study suggests that negative reviews written politely could help sell a product. In a series of five experiments, scientists looked at how including a marker of politeness in a negative online review affected the image of both the reviewer and the product being sold. A new U.S. study suggests that negative reviews written honestly and politely could help sell a product . Markers of politeness could include phrases like ‘I'll be honest,’ and ‘I don't want to be mean, but…’ In one experiment, participants were asked to read a page-long description of a luxury watch. Two versions of the product description were used, one of which added the polite customer complaint: ‘I don't want to be mean, but the band pinches a bit.’ Phrases 'I'll be honest,' and 'I don't want to be mean, but...' are ways to soften the arrival of bad news on online retail websites such as Amazon . A recent study of 1,193 American online shoppers by YouGov has found that sites such as Amazon, TripAdvisor and Yelp are now the go-to destinations for customers who want to cut through advertising waffle and discover what products and services are really like.Nearly half of respondents in the survey said that the most popular site for online reviews . was Amazon. This was followed by Google and Yahoo on . 14 per cent and 13 per cent respectively. Yelp came fourth with 10 per cent, and TripAdvisor was fifth with eight per cent. Movie site Rotten Tomatoes received two per cent, while Air BnB and Seamless both featured in one per cent of the reviews. 'Other websites' were quoted as the final 8 per cent. According to the YouGov research, 39 per cent of people have never left an online review. Results revealed that people were willing to pay £24 ($41) more for the watch if they read the description that included the marker of politeness. ‘Most of the research on consumer reviews has been on the content and volume of the message,’ wrote the study’s authors. ‘Our research looks at how the politeness with which a particular message is communicated affects consumer opinions.’ The study was undertaken by researchers at Emory University in Atlanta, the University of Minnesota and the University of Chicago. As part of the study, the researchers also asked participants to complete a survey evaluating the ‘personality’ of the brand. Results showed that the polite review caused the brand to be seen as more ‘honest, cheerful, down-to-earth, and wholesome’ than the same review without the polite customer complaint. ‘Our research raises the intriguing possibility that brands might benefit when polite customers write reviews of their products - even when those reviews include negative opinions,’ the study authors said. But many online reviews do not reflect real experiences with the product. A separate survey earlier this year found that a fifth of Americans have left online reviews for items they’ve never bought or even used. The survey of 1,193 American online shoppers by YouGov found that this figure is even higher (32 per cent) among parents with children under 18 and the most popular reason why online shoppers questioned did this was simply because ‘they felt like it.’ More than 22 per cent admitted they left a negative review because they didn’t like the idea of the product, while 19 per cent said the product received a bad review because they didn’t like the company who made it. According to recent research, a fifth of Americans have left online reviews for items they've never bought or even used. The majority (32%) claimed they did so simply because they felt like it, while 22% admitted they didn't like the idea of the product. One in ten claimed they left spoof reviews for comedy effect, pictured .","In one experiment, people were willing to pay £24 ($41) more for a watch if they read a negative online review that included a marker of politeness .

"By . Emma Innes . A young West Ham striker has died after a three year battle with testicular cancer. Dylan Tombides, 20, passed away today with his family at his bedside. The Australian footballer was first diagnosed with cancer while representing Australia during the 2011 Under 17 World Cup in Mexico. Dylan Tombides, a 20-year-old West Ham striker, has died after a three year battle with testicular cancer . Tombides was diagnosed with cancer in 2011 and he died today with his family at his bedside. He is pictured (second right) with his father, Jim, brother, Taylor, and mother, Tracylee . He fought the disease for three years but has sadly lost his battle. West Ham released a statement which read: 'West . Ham United announce the sad news that forward Dylan Tombides has passed . away at the age of 20 following his brave battle with cancer. 'Dylan . passed away on Friday morning with his family by his side having . courageously fought the disease for three years after initially being . diagnosed with testicular cancer in summer 2011.' Perth-born . Tombides was regarded as one of the most exciting young players to come . out of Australia after signing with West Ham as a 14-year-old. After being diagnosed with cancer he battled back to make his first-team début in a League Cup match against Wigan in 2012. His death will be marked by a minute's applause before West Ham's home match against Crystal Palace this weekend. Tombides was viewed as one of the best players to come out of Australia. He is pictured sending a birthday message to his mother after scoring in the Under 17 World Cup in 2011 . Before he passed away, Dylan took to Twitter to thank fans for their support . Tombides was told he has cancer while in Cancun, Mexico, with his father. A random drugs test following a match against Uzbekistan has uncovered a tumour on one of his testicles. In an interview he explained: ‘I was 17, a young man and I had never come across cancer. All I was thinking about was getting in the West Ham team and taking my driving test. Since Tombides' death, tributes have poured in for the young footballer . 'All I ever wanted to be was a top professional footballer with West Ham. I copped one in my groin against Brazil at the World Cup and I knew that I had a problem, but I had no idea it was cancer. ‘It was only when I took the phone call in Cancun that I realised just how serious the condition was. 'I had the blood tests and CT scans when I got back to England and they told me I needed to have a testicle removed immediately.' FIFA president Sepp Blatter led the messages of condolences to Tombides' family tweeting: 'My thoughts & prayers are with the family of Dylan Tombides'. He is pictured showing off a surgical scar in May 2012 . Football mad: Tombides shows off his West Ham and Australia shirts to cameraman Alan Walter . Tombides has a 45 minute operation to remove the tumour and then spent weeks in St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, having chemotherapy. His mother, Traceylee, said in an earlier interview: 'It was a period of helplessness. As a parent we wanted to protect our kids, but we had no control. 'I often thought cancer would happen in the lives of our family at some point, but not my kids.’ FIFA president Sepp Blatter led the messages of condolences to Tombides' family by tweeting: 'My thoughts & prayers are with the family of Dylan Tombides, @whufc_official & @FFA today. Rest in peace Dylan.' Testicular cancer is most common in men aged 15 to 44 and affects 2,000 each year in the UK. The most common symptom is a lump or swelling in one testicle, but 20 per cent of patients also experience pain in their testicles or lower abdomen. A feeling of 'heaviness' in the scrotum is another symptom. People with an undescended testicle have a greater risk of testicular cancer as do people with a family history of the disease. It is five times more common in white men than in black men and is also more common in tall men. It is one of the most treatable cancers - 97 per cent of patients survive for more than five years after diagnosis. For more information visit www.orchid-cancer.org.uk . In it's statement the club added: . 'Dylan's amazing resilience and positivity saw him through months of . surgery and chemotherapy, while his outstanding talent saw him make his . first-team début in a League Cup tie with Wigan Athletic at the Boleyn . Ground in September 2012. 'Away from the pitch, Dylan did a huge amount of work to raise awareness of male cancer, supporting the One for the Boys campaign at a number of high-profile events alongside the likes of Hollywood star Samuel L. Jackson, snooker star Jimmy White and fellow Australian Peter Andre. 'Dylan was respected by everyone who knew . him for his intelligent views on the game and his larger than life . character. 'He was a loving son, amazing brother and well-respected . member of the West Ham squad. He will be hugely missed by everyone who . had the honour of knowing him. 'His passing will be marked by a . minute's applause ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League fixture . with Crystal Palace at the Boleyn Ground. The Hammers' players will also . wear black armbands in his memory. 'The . thoughts of everyone associated with the club are with his parents . Tracylee and Jim, brother Taylor, his family and friends at this sad . time. 'The club request that their privacy is now respected and they are allowed to grieve their much loved son and brother in peace.' Dylan's . brother Taylor, a West Ham youth player, tweeted: 'R.I.P. Dylan my . beloved brother you will be missed but never forgotten you was a massive . inspiration to everyone.'

It is one of the most treatable cancers - 97 per cent of patients survive for more than five years after diagnosis. John Hartson, 39, was diagnosed with testicular cancer in 2009. The former Arsenal and West Ham United player was given chemotherapy because the cancer had spread to his brain and lungs. The treatment was successful and in December 2009 it was reported that the cancer had been virtually eradicated from his body. Despite this, he was told he would need more treatment. Neil Harris, a Millwall and Southend player, was diagnosed with the disease in 2001. He was diagnosed after noticing that one of his testicles felt larger than the other. He had surgery and radiotherapy and says he was lucky because his cancer was caught early. He returned to playing football just months after his diagnosis. Alan Stubbs, 42, who played for Bolton Wanterers, Celtic, Everton, Sunderland and Derby County has battled cancer twice. He initially had testicular cancer and then a tumour was found at the base of his spine. He has now been free of cancer for more than 10 years. Chris Anderson, a Spartans striker, was diagnosed with testicular cancer last year. After eight months of treatment he was given the all-clear.","Dylan Tombides was diagnosed with testicular cancer in 2011 .

Carson Hartley has had 40 operations, 10 for every year he has been alive. He was only taken home for the first time aged three and a half. Carson suffers from a terminal genetic condition called Mitochondrial disease which causes a breakdown in the body's cells. There is no cure to the disease. Kirsty Hartley (R) tied the knot with her partner Damian so that their four-year-old son, Carson, who is terminally ill, could be at the wedding . Mrs Hadley said: 'Damian and I want to make the most of his time with us by spending it as a family. We want to make life as wonderful for Carson as we can for as long as we can' Carson is pictured here at his parents' wedding with Leyton, 7, (L), Ethan, 13 (Rear) and Lewis, 14, holding his little brother's hand . Parents, Kirsty and Damian Hartley from  Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire have written a 'bucket list' of activities so that their son can make the most out of the time that he has left. As well as the wedding, items on the agenda include meeting CBeebies' Mr Tumble, also Carson's idol and cartoon character Peppa Pig. He has also met Kate Middleton and his parents have plans such as taking him to the beach and swimming together in the sea. Mr and Mrs Hartley have given up everything to become full-time carers for their little boy. Mrs Hartley, . 34, said: 'This diagnosis is hard to take. From what we understand it is . a cruel disease and unpredictable. Some children have a few weeks, for . others it takes years. 'Weddings are an emotional day, but even more so with Carson there and walking down the aisle. Carson has spent three and a half of his four years in hospital. He has now been told that his illness is terminal. Parents Kirsty and Damian Hadley have become full-time carers for the little boy . 'We . want his bucket list to be full of simple, achievable things that other . children would take for granted.

'Doctors didn’t know what the affects would be, and asked Damian and me if it was worth keeping him alive for the standard of life he would have. 'But we said that as long as he kept fighting, we couldn’t give up on him.' The couple said they were filled with 'mixed emotions' and were proud of Carson's achievements such as walking and sign language. But, his mother added: 'It will all be taken away from him.' Carson also has four siblings: Leyton, seven, Ethan, 13, Lewis, 14, and Chloe, 16. They have have also planned activities for Carson to enjoy in his short life.

Mitochondria produces energy within the body required by cells to function correctly. If the cells are not fed energy, the tissues that the cells are made up of do not work properly - this is what happens in the case of Mitochondria disease patients. Each person who suffers from the disease is affected differently but a common symptom is contraction of the muscles. Organs typically affected include: The brain, the heart and the kidney - which all require more energy than other body parts to function correctly. It is an extremely rare genetic disease and symptoms can manifest themselves at any age. The disease is progressive, meaning that a patient's condition slowly deteriorates over time. There is currently no cure for Mitochondrial disease but some patients have found that certain diets help them live with the condition more effectively.

"By . Ben Spencer . Controversial: A designer crop has been genetically engineered to produce cod liver oil . A controversial designer crop genetically engineered to produce fish oils has received approval to be grown in our fields. Owen Paterson’s environment department, Defra, announced it had rubber stamped the first GM field test in three years. Scientists will start planting the crop next month in a heavily guarded field in Hertfordshire, in the first stage of a trial that will last four years. Rothamsted Research - the body behind the trial - claim the crop, Camelina sativa, will create a synthetic form of cod liver oil that could be sold on shop shelves by 2020. The scientists developed the engineered plant by ‘cutting and pasting’ genes from algae into a tall, spindly flax plant similar to oil seed rape. They claim the crop produces the same amount of healthy omega-3 fatty acids as fish oils. Opponents of ‘Frankenstein foods’ are worried about hidden ecological and health risks of the crop, which have not yet been tested. They also view the approval as further evidence of the Environment Secretary’s unbridled enthusiasm for GM technology. Mr . Paterson has warned that Britain risks becoming the ‘museum of world . farming’ if it does not embrace GM - and dismissed opponents of the . science as ‘wicked’. Professor . Johnathan Napier, lead scientist at the taxpayer-funded . Rothamsted research project, claims the technology will take pressure . off dwindling fish stocks. 'Frankenfish': The process means you no longer need actual fish, like the mackerel pictured, to produce fish oil . Speaking to the Mail in January he said: ‘We are interested in producing fish oils in plants because fish oils, and the long-chained omega 3 fatty acids, are known to be very important for human health and nutrition. ‘Global fish stocks are in decline so there is a problem of the availability of fish for these fatty acids.’ Laboratory experiments have shown that . by inserting up to seven genes from algae into Camelina, the plant can . produce two key omega-3 fatty acids that are normally obtained from oily . fish, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) anddocosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The . acids are linked to health benefits for the heart, brain and nervous . system and are thought to provide greater protection against diseases . such as Alzheimer’s. Rothamsted said its initial hopes for the new crop is as a feed in fish farms, which consume 80 per cent of fish oil supplies. But . Professor Napier said that by the end of the decade, the GM-produced . oil could be sold for human consumption as an omega-3 supplement or as . an addition to food products such as margarine. He added: ‘By the end of this decade, . there’s a possibility that people will be able to obtain a GM . plant-based source of fish oils.’ Supporter: Secretary of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Owen Patterson, approved the test . But . he admitted none of the oil had so far been consumed by humans and it . would need to pass rigorous health checks before it could enter the food . chain. GM Freeze director . Liz O’Neill said: ‘We know that the Environment Secretary Owen Paterson . strongly favours GM, but rushing a poor trial into the ground just to . prove a political point really isn’t going to win the confidence of the . British public or strike most people as a good use of public money.’ Dr . Ricarda Steinbrecher, a geneticist at EcoNexus, a non-profit research . organisation in Oxford, said genetic engineering risked introducing . unintended DNA mutations. A genetically engineered crop designed to produce a synthetic form of cod liver oil. Scientists engineered the plant by ‘cutting and pasting’ genes from algae into a tall, spindly flax plant similar to oil seed rape. The crop produces the same amount of omega-3 fatty acids as fish oils. Supporters claim it will take pressure off the world’s depleting fish stocks. Opponents worried about hidden ecological and health risks of the crop, which have not yet been tested. She said: ‘There are more risks than are immediately obvious. ‘Risks arise not only from the new . trait and the interference caused by the new genes but also from the . many DNA mutations that occur during the engineering processes. ‘Will the plant still produce all its original nutrients? Will it produce toxins? Will it still be safe to consume?’ In . the last decade only four GM field trials have been approved - three . for blight-resistant potatoes and one, in 2011, for aphid resistant . wheat. If it passes the tests it would still have a long way to go before it could be commercially developed.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Women lower the pitch of their voice and increase their hoarseness to sound sexy like Scarlet Johansson (pictured) whereas men who tried to sound more attractive failed in a study . People try all sorts of tricks to attract the perfect partner. But experts have proved that women have one weapon of seduction in their arsenal that men do not – the power to make their voices sexier. Women lower the pitch of their voice and increase their hoarseness to sound more attractive, whereas men who tried to sound sexy failed and in some cases sounded less attractive, a study found. Scientists also revealed that both sexes slow their speech to sound more attractive and can also manipulate their voices to sound more intelligent. A series of experiments at Albright College in Reading, Pennsylvania, proved that women have little trouble in lowering their voices to sound sexier. Susan Hughes, associate professor of psychology at the university, said: ‘This ability may be due to culture and cuts across cultures and time. There is a stereotype of what is a sexual voice in our culture – a low, breathy voice.’ The study, which will be published in the Journal of Nonverbal Behaviour, examined the patterns that emerge when men and women intentionally modify their voices to project four traits related to mate selection and competition – sexiness, dominance, intelligence and confidence – and how others perceive these manipulations. A total of 40 men and women provided intentionally manipulated voice samples for the desired traits, plus a normal speech sample which involved counting from one to 10, while a panel of another 40 people assessed the degree to which each sample effectively projected the given trait. The researchers found that women could make their voices sound more attractive, but men could not. ‘In fact, although not significantly, it got a bit worse when men tried to sound sexy,’ Dr Hughes said. Women can fake dominance but not confidence: The study found that women could not sound more confident, unlike men such as Jeremy Clarkson (pictured left) but both sexes can make their voices sound more dominant, such as Margaret Thatcher (right) who took vocal coaching before she became Prime Minister . Psychologists have previously claimed that the secret of seduction lies in a husky voice. A 2010 study found that both women and men subconsciously lower their pitch when they are flirting. The technique is particularly used over the phone, when the usual signs of chemistry - eye contact, arm touching and hair flicking - will not work. The study, which was also conducted at Albright College, dispels the idea that women adopt higher, more traditionally feminine tones, when they are attracted to someone. The researchers tested 48 students of both sexes by asking them to look at images of people and then leave a scripted voicemail message for them. The more attractive the person in the photo, the lower the tone of voice used in the answerphone message, they found. The study suggests that the difference is rooted in mate selection and says that women know that men place greater emphasis on looks when choosing a partner and that whether a voice sounds sexy can indicate physical beauty. ‘Thus, it is beneficial for women to sound sexier to enhance their value to potential mates and to stave off competition from rival females,’ the study says. Spectogram analysis, which visually represents sound frequencies, found that both sexes can manipulate their voices to sound more intelligent. However, the study found that women could not sound more confident. Men could, but only when judged by women. The researchers think that men have the ability to sound more confident because they know it can attract women who are looking for indications of financial and personal success in a potential partner. Men may be more attuned to detecting male posturing and more inclined to underrate their competition. In charge: The researchers found that men and women could both manipulate their voices to sound more dominant. They believe that this may indicate a cultural shift because more women perform traditionally male-dominated roles (pictured) who may have chosen to modify their voices to sound more formidable . The . researchers were surprised to find that both men and women could . both manipulate their voices to sound more dominant. They believe that this may indicate a cultural shift because there are more women performing traditionally male-dominated roles and leadership positions, who may have chosen to modify their voices to sound more formidable, as demonstrated by Margaret Thatcher, who received vocal training to sound more domineering in her bid to become Prime Minister. The experts think their study could be used for voice coaching actors and politicians who want to communicate more effectively with an audience.","Women lower the pitch of their voice and increase their hoarseness to sound sexy but men who try to sound more attractive can sound worse .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . A pricey pint: Australian experts have warned that global warming could significantly increase the price of a pint of beer . From rising sea levels to extreme weather ravaging countries and destroying homes, climate change is blamed for a range of undesirable events. And now Australian experts have warned that global warming could significantly increase the price of a pint of beer - and even change the taste. It is thought that if the planet gets hotter there will be more frequent droughts to regions that grow grains such as barley, which is a key ingredient in beer. If barley is in extra demand, the price of it will rise and buying beer will be more expensive as a result, scientists told The Brisbane Times. In a bid to keep the price of a pint stable, a team of researchers from the University of Queensland are trying to drought-proof barley. They have identified ‘stay-green’ characteristics in types of barley that were first spotted in another grain called sorghum, which grows in hot places. Researcher Peter Gous told the newspaper that the discovery could mean a stable supply of carbohydrates for the brewing process. Climate change could affect the amount . of starch in barley, pushing the cost of a serving of beer up . from around $5 (£2.70) to as much as $20 (£11), Mr Gous warned. ‘I'm . not saying they're the actual values, but the amount of energy and . water and things that have to go into the brewing process will . increase,’ he said. Beer at risk: It is thought that is the planet gets hotter there will be more frequent droughts to regions that grow grains such as barley (pictured) which is a key ingredient in beer . Sorghum is a genus of grasses with about 30 species, one of which is raised for grain. The plants are cultivated in warm climates worldwide. One species, Sorghum bicolor, is native to Africa and is an important crop  used for food, fodder alcoholic beverages and biofuels. Most varieties are drought and heat-tolerant and are especially important in arid regions, where the grain is a staple food. Sorghum bicolor is an important food crop in Africa, Central America and South Asia and is the fifth most important cereal crop grown in the world. The study, which was published in the Journal of Cereal Science, detailed how a ‘stay-green’ set of genes could be bred into grains to help them deal with drought and maintain their starch structure. He said: ‘It is a trait that naturally . occurs, more in wild types of barley like regrowth and things like . that. So basically breeders have gone back to ancient sources of sorghum . and reintroduced them, because with conventional breeding eventually . you lose traits that are beneficial, and drought-proof the plant.’ Farmers . had bred away from the ‘stay-green’ aspects of the crop in favour of . focusing purely on yields, so the scientists have re-introduced the traits. Preserving the pint: Experts explained that selective breeding will benefit brewers, who want the barley grain to have quality of the starch to maintain a consistent flavour as well as farmers who could still get a decent crop even in bad weather conditions such as drought (illustrated) Mr Gous explained that the move could benefit brewers, who want the grain to have quality starch to maintain a consistent flavour, as well as farmers who would still get a decent crop even in bad weather conditions. While Mr Gous could not guarantee to safeguard barley for beer, he said that ‘with certain drought-tolerant traits, you can have a more stable supply of specific quality grain’. Dr Glen Fox, also at the university, . said sorghum breeders had long taken advantage of ‘stay-green’ characteristics for improved yield and a similar trait in barley could . present growers with an innovative way of responding to the challenges . of climate change. The two plants are distantly related and both evolved in warmer parts of the world. Dr Glen Fox said sorghum breeders had long taken advantage of 'stay-green' characteristics for improved yield, and a similar trait in barley could present growers with an innovative way of responding to the challenges of climate change. A field of sorghum is pictured . ‘So if we can help growers produce barley that is more in-tune with what industry wants, we’re well on the way to improving productivity and profitability,’ he said. Each year Australia produces about two million tonnes of malting barley and a good proportion of that is exported throughout Asia and the Pacific. ‘Our team’s research has shown that normal grain development and starch composition can survive significant water and heat stress in selected barley lines,’ he added.","Climate change could affect the amount .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . ‘Let me Yahoo that for you’ is a phrase a lot of iPhone users might soon have to get used to. It’s been revealed that Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer is intent on getting Apple to switch its default engine from Google to Yahoo. Currently Google is the default search engine on all Apple mobile devices. Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, seen here delivering her keynote address at the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada on 7 January 2014, is intent on making the tech giant a big player in the search engine market by getting Apple to dump Google as its default search engine . Whether you’re using the web or talking to Siri, Google’s powerful algorithms are the automatic method of finding what you were after. Of course, you can alter your device’s settings to change this to one of the other providers like Yahoo or Microsoft’s Bing. According to sources speaking to re/code, however, Google’s competitors are not going down without a fight. For starters, Bing has taken over from Google as the brains behind Siri. It has been a difficult 12 months for Yahoo. Last May, BT announced it was switching its 6 million subscribers from using Yahoo Mail after reports of problems and bugs with the service. Then, in October, a redesign was met with outrage after thousands of users complained the new Yahoo Mail had removed popular features and was more difficult to use. In December, Yahoo was also among the major companies targeted by the Pony botnet in which two million accounts were compromised. And most recently, Yahoo was announced as one of the many websites susceptible to the Heartbleed bug. But with the impressive performance of China's Alibaba, in which Yahoo holds a large share, the company could get a cash injection that will enable it to boost its profile. And Yahoo has already set in motion plans to pitch Apple a bold idea to dump Google for good. It has been reported that Yahoo's search functionality, which was previously powered by Bing, will be given a revamp as a standalone service. ‘This is the aim of the whole effort here, to grab the pole position in iOS search,’ one person working on the plans said. ‘It will take more than pretty pictures, though, to convince Apple to give up on Google, given its focus on consumer experience being top-notch. ‘But Marissa wants it very badly.’ If successful, the bid could signal a turn in fortunes for a company that has struggled to keep itself relevant on the Internet. Since 2007 Yahoo has had seven different CEOs, each of whom has attempted to reverse a downward spiral for the website. And last year, BT ended its affiliation with Yahoo Mail after reported problems with the service. But things now seem to be on the up, especially with an impressive quarterly performance for China’s Alibaba, which Yahoo has a large stake in. Despite a sometimes frosty relationship, Apple and Google have worked in tandem for many years although both Google Maps and YouTube were dropped as default apps on iPhones and iPads last year . This decision to focus their efforts to search engines, however, will be a whole new challenge for Yahoo. The company is said to be intent on making itself a powerful player in the mobile search engine business. And Mayer’s dream to make Yahoo the default search engine for the Safari browser on Apple’s iPhone and iPad is a big part of that effort. Mayer is said to have even prepared images and details of what the product would look like to pitch to Apple. Apple, meanwhile, is yet to comment but it is believed a deal is not imminent. This isn’t the first time Yahoo and Google have locked horns – it was recently reported that the former was planning to launch a competitor to Google’s YouTube. Although Apple’s relationship with Yahoo is reportedly very good, the iOS giant will understandably be reticent to burn any more bridges with Google, considering its services are generally loved by Apple consumers. Apple has already dropped both Google Maps and YouTube as default apps on their devices. Would Apple be willing to burn more bridges with Google? That's what Mayer will be hoping when she pitches the revamped Yahoo search service to the company soon in a bid to become its primary search engine . Getting customers to accept Yahoo as their primary search engine might be a big ask. But Mayer’s previous experience in charge of product development within search functionality at Google could prove invaluable. She will be all too aware of the revenue Google reaps in from being the number one search engine. The plan is also rumoured to signal an end to Yahoo’s search and advertising partnership with Microsoft. Mayer seems determined to make big waves in the search engine field with Yahoo.","Marissa Meyer is reportedly planning a secret assault on Google .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . The age of the ‘selfie’ is well and truly upon us, but until now taking your own photo has required you to, well, take your own photo. Enter SELFIE, the ‘Self Enhancing Live Feed Image Engine’ mirror that takes your picture when you smile at it. Scroll down for video . Say cheese! The SELFIE mirror takes your photo when you smile at it for two seconds and then crafts a tweet including your photo for you . The brains behind the product is American digital agency iStrategyLabs. They devised the mirror as a fun and easy way to take selfies without the signature arm's length-style shot. And they say the mirror could be used in a variety of environments, from businesses to bars. ‘We had to experiment with the platform a little bit to get it working,’ iStrategyLabs Chief Marketing Officer DJ Saul tells MailOnline. ‘We had some funny things like it would locate a smile on the side of your head, so we played around until we were comfortable. Behind the mirror is a Mac mini computer . This powers a piece of freely available facial recognition software called Open CV. A webcam then looks outwards through the two-way mirror. When you smile, LEDs controlled by Arduiono light up vertically on the mirror. After two seconds the LEDs ‘flash’ white and it snaps your photo . The mirror then creates a tweet with the image for you. Several . people can also get in the shot, although it can’t recreate a photo . with as many as people as the famous Oscar selfie just yet. ‘We also considered photos being . triggered by a wink, but we went with a smile as it fit with the . narrative a bit more for a smiling selfie.’ At the moment the company doesn’t have plans to make it commercially available, although they are considering supplying it to businesses. But they say the 'really awesome potential' would be to mass produce it for hundreds of users. ‘It could absolutely also be deployed in bars and things,’ Saul continues. ‘The core experience is not that different from a photobooth really. ‘What makes this special is all you see as a user is the mirror itself. ‘The hands-free selfie is a tagline we’re playing around with. ‘You literally just stare into it and smile.’ SELFIE looks just like a normal mirror (left) until you approach it and smile (right) for two seconds, causing LEDs to light up and putting the technology at work to capture your picture .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . You might think of cats and dogs as merely faithful companions. But a new book says we are starting to treat them more and more like humans. And it may affect our laws, not only legally but socially as well, in ways we hadn’t imagined. Mugshot: A new book claims that cats and dogs are being treated more and more like humans . In the US, 90% of pet-owners regard their animals as part of the family. And $60 billion (£35 billion) was spent on companion animals in the US alone in 2013. The implications of this are that owners are treating their pets just like they would another human. ‘People are shelling out money and risking their lives to save their pet,’ David Grimm, author of Citizen Canine: Our Evolving Relationship With Cats and Dogs tells MailOnline. ‘You wouldn’t do that for a bird or a toaster. Cats and dogs are getting this rarefied status in the home.' Grimm, who also teaches science journalism at John Hopkins University, Maryland, says that cats and dogs have achieved a status in Western cultures that is unheard of for any other animal. They are being treated more like people in society and law, blurring the lines between animals and person. Research has found dogs are the most popular pets for animals lovers. Married men living in the countryside are most likely to own a dog. While single women in their twenties are most likely to own a cat. More than half of dog owners describe themselves as hardworking. Whereas the majority of cat owners claim to be introverted and messy. ‘In some legal cases the best interests of the cat and dog are considered,’ Grimm continues. ‘And judges are awarding more emotional distress damages from killing cats and dogs. ‘In the past it used to be $50 (£30), now it’s in the tens of thousands of dollars. ‘And during Hurricane Katrina, rescuers were saving pets as well as people. ‘It’s a revolution not only in our homes, but in society and law.’ While the change in status of the animals may give rise to complications, it also has some benefits. Not least, the animals now have greater protection than ever before. But this could have some far-reaching connotations. For example, Grimm envisages a future where if a pet owner didn’t walk their dog enough, or it wasn’t given proper medical treatment, an organisation could turn up and take it away like a child. ‘There are a lot of bizarre consequences, and perhaps if pets were regarded as people they couldn’t be neutered. ‘So there’s a really interesting precipice for where we decide to go next.’ Doctor, doctor: Treating pets more like people could make trips to the vet more complicated . In ancient Egypt cats were worshipped as gods and given ethereal status, but this is one of the first times in history that they have been given almost an equal footing to humans. According to Grimm, some people are fighting for cats and dogs to be considered more like children. They could one day be allowed into restaurants, and apartments would not be allowed to have ‘no pet’ policies. But from the perspective of the cats and dogs themselves, we’re not quite sure if they are starting to think like us yet. ‘From more than a dozen labs around the world studying dogs, we know they have a sense of morality, justice and jealously,’ says Grimm. ‘We are discovering more going forwards.’ ‘Cats are harder to study, there hasn’t been a lot of research into the feline mind.’ ‘But as a cat owner myself, I hope we’ll discover they’re just as capable as dogs are.’","Cats and dogs are treated more like people than ever before, says author .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Rome is celebrating its official 2,767th birthday next week. But at least 100 more candles should be added to the Eternal City’s cake if experts are correct in thinking that Rome is between 100 and 200 years older than previously claimed. It has been said that the ancient city was founded on April 21 in the year 753BC, partly based upon the myth of Romulus and Remus. More ancient than thought: Rome is officially celebrating its 2,767th birthday next week,but archeologists ahve discovered a piece of wall that suggests the is between 100 and 200 years older than previously claimed. A view of the Roman Forum is pictured from the ancient Palatine Hill . Romulus and Remus were twins born of Rhea Silvia, daughter to Numitor, the king of Alba Longa. Before their birth, the king's brother Amulius seizes power and forces Rhea to become a vestal virgin, sworn to chastity. She conceives the twins by the god Mars and Amulius leaves them to die by the Rover Tiber when he finds out. They are saved by a she-wolf, are fed by a woodpecker and they are bought up as shepherds. Ignorant of their ancestry, they prove to be great leaders and when they find out the truth, kill Amulius and restore Numitor to his throne, before founding a new city - Rome. Romulus wants to found the city on Palatine Hill, while Remus prefers Aventine Hill. After an argument, Remus is killed and Rome is founded and named after the victorious twin, Romulus. The myth was developed into an 'official' story in the Late Republican and early Imperial era of Rome, with Roman historians dating the city to between 758 and 728BC. The official date of the formation of Rome is April 21 in the year 753BC. But archaeological evidence suggests that Rome could predate the popular establishment date by 100 or more years. Italian newspaper Il Messagero reported that Patrizia Fortini, the archaeologist who is responsible for Rome’s Forum, has discovered a wall that was constructed before the founding date of the city. It is made from blocks of volcanic tuff – a material made from compressed volcanic ash - and looks like it was built to channel water from an aquifer running from under the Capitoline Hill to the River Spino, which is a small tributary of Rome’s River Tiber, according to The Guardian. Archaeologists also found pottery fragments and the remains of food next to the wall, which is located close to the Lapis Niger, or Black Stone, which is a shrine that Romans visited to recognise the earliest days of the city. Dr Fortini said: ‘The examination of the ceramic material was crucial, allowing us today to fix the wall chronologically between the 9th century and the beginning of the 8th century.’ A bit of a howler? The discovery of the wall hints that the construction of the city in stone began earlier than documented by Roman historians, who based their version of events on the myth of Romulus and Remus who were said to be raised by a she-wolf (a famous statue is pictured) The discovery of the wall hints that the construction of the city in stone began earlier than previously imagined. The site near to where the wall was found includes a block of stone called 'Lex Sacra' with what is thought to be the earliest inscription in Latin, written in approximately 565BC. While the meaning of the engraving isn’t known, there is a rumour that anyone who damages the site will be cursed. Archaeologists have been excavating the site since 2009 using historic photos and research to make new discoveries. They include the work of famed archaeologist Giacomo Boni, who led the excavation of the Roman Forum from 1899 until 1925 when he died, The Telegraph reported. The site near to where the wall was found includes a block of stone called 'Lex Sacra' with what is thought to be the earliest inscription in Latin, written in approximately 565BC. The aquifer, of which the wall is thought to have been a part, ran from the Capitoline Hill (marked on the map) to a tributary of the River Tiber . From his images, Dr Fortuni's team made 3D models of the site and used laser scanners to determine the wall's exact location. The old adage that Rome wasn’t built in a day is true and experts think the city started as a small settlement that grew over the years and that the traditional date for its foundation was merely invented by a writer later in the city’s Roman history. The wall could therefore hint at one of the earliest parts of the settlement, from which the rest of the city spread from. Historians have previously said there is evidence of people settling on the Palatine Hill – the centremost of the Seven Hills of Rome and one of the most ancient parts of the city – as early as the 10th century BC.","Rome is celebrating its 2,767th birthday next week and could be between 100 and 200 years older than thought .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Teens are in danger of doing long-term damage to their spines by leaning over screens for up to four hours . It's unlikely computer addicted teenagers will take any notice â€“ although desperate parents might be grateful for this ammunition. Four in ten teens have suffered back or neck pain from spending too much time slouched in front of the TV or a computer screen, according to researchers. A study by the British Chiropractic Association revealed that more than one in seven parents said their son or daughterâ€™s problem was a result of using a laptop, tablet or computer. The survey of more than 460 parents of 11- to 16-year-olds also found that 23 per cent of teens are spending between two and four hours a day watching TV, while a quarter spend the same amount of time on a laptop, tablet or computer. Based on a two hour period, young people spend more time on games consoles (33 per cent) than doing an activity such as riding a bicycle (12 per cent). When asked how much time their teenager spends on their bicycle, more than one in five parents (21 per cent) admitted that their child doesn't even have a bike. Nearly half of the parents polled (46 per cent) acknowledged that their children don't spend enough time exercising, despite NHS guidelines stating that children and young people between five and 18-years-old need to do at least one hour of physical activity every day. Now the BCA is encouraging parents to limit the time their children spend using technology. Commenting on the study to mark Chiropractic Awareness Week, BCA chiropractor Rishi Loatey, said: 'We are seeing more and more people under the age of 16 with back and neck pain and technology is so often the cause. The British Chiropractic Association told parents of 11-16-year-olds their children spend more time on laptops than doing physical exercise such as riding a bike or running . 'Young people are becoming increasingly sedentary which is damaging their posture. 'There is the tendency to sit in a hunched position when working on computers and laptops, putting a lot of strain on the neck. 'Learning how to sit properly and keeping active will help to keep young people healthy and pain free. 'It's important that parents seek help for their children from an expert as soon as any pain starts - if conditions are left untreated it could lead to chronic back and neck problems in later life.'","Four in ten teens suffered back or neck pain from slouching, study shows .

Edward ran away from his special needs school in Allegan on March 19, which is when the incident with the police occurred . When a teacher finally caught up to Edward at this party store, some distance from the school, they called police for assistance . Police were called to help, and according to the their report, school staff requested the officer drive Edward back to the school. This is when the real trouble started. When he was asked his name, Edward is said to have cursed at the officer and assaulted him. The report also said that, once in the back of the police car, Edward broke off a rear camera. The officer then decided to charge him. 'I don't even think he did anything wrong in this case. - he's special needs,' Edwards stepfather, Robert Bluhm, told Fox 43. 'He's ran away from the school before . . . but he's never made it as far as he did this time. 'He has special needs. He has anger issues. They know this, and they're going to throw him in the back of a cop car all by himself?' 'If they had him under control, why didn't they ride with him in the back of this cop car? Not impressed: Edward's stepfather, Robert Bluhm, said the situation could have been handled different and that an eight-year-old she not be up for criminal charges . Edward is accused of breaking a video camera in the back of this police car . 'So this incident would have never took place?' Mr Bluhm said they had 'majorly' disciplined Edward over the incident, banning him from TV for a week, making him spend a day in a timeout chair and taking away his Nintendo DS. As their own punishment, Allegan Police Department are asking for a $50 payment to repair the camera. Mr Buhm said they intend to paw the Nintendo DS to pay for it. Police Chief Rick Hoyer told Fox43 said he does not agree with the prosecutor's office decision to charge the eight-year-old in a criminal sense.","Edward Hart, 8, ran away from his special needs school in Allegan, Michigan, on March 19 .

"By . Joshua Gardner . An Ohio wife and mother is facing felony theft charges after duping her entire town into believing she had terminal intestinal cancer. Police say Mindy Taylor, 35, of Chillicothe, managed to bilk friends, family, neighbors and old college chums out of over $20,000 while even her husband was convinced his wife was fighting for her life. And she managed to milk it further by putting on a brave face. Not only did she play the part of the dying mother, but she had everyone in awe of her strength of will throughout what they believed to be an horrific ordeal. Doing alright: Ohio mother Mindy Taylor, 35, allegedly duped most of the town of Chillicothe and even a town a state away in Pennsylvania that she was dying from intestinal cancer . Outrageous: Two charitable giving sites sprung up for Mindy, created by concerned friends, family and even strangers who called themselves Mindy's Army. This one raised $13,234 of a $30,000 goal to offset her 'medical expenses' According to the Columbus Dispatch, Taylor had a long history of illnesses. She claimed to suffer from heart disease, strokes and lupus from a young age. Specialists across the country were unable to figure out just how and why she suffered so many health problems. When things seemed to become even worse sometime in late 2013 or early 2014, her friends, family and neighbors rallied around her. She had intestinal cancer, she said, and was fearing for the worst. But Taylor put on a brave face and became an admired figure in her central Ohio town. She began to post her day to day struggles to a fundraising blog as donations began to pour in from people who called themselves Mindy's Army. Friends even organized a charity run and purchased t-shirts to support her and her family. In deep: Family and friends rallied around the 35-year-old mother and even organized and fundraiser run to benefit her, her 7-year-old daughter and her husband . Bizarre: Even Taylor's husband believed his wife could soon die of intestinal cancer that seemed to have moved to her liver . '#mindysarmy isn’t just about me,' she wrote in a seemingly humble February 16 post. 'It’s about anyone that is fighting with an illness or cancer or a hard time, so try to remember that as you look down and see your wrist. Stay positive and always try to do the next right thing!' Those wrists were adorned in Live Strong style bracelets, only they were for Mindy's Army. A day after her face appeared on the February 24 cover of a local newspaper with a headline touting her Mindy's 'Friends, Family and Faith' she posted this: . 'I so appreciate everyone ... the texts to keep me awake, the prayers, the support, the ongoing financial contributions are all appreciated so much.' Everyone she knew thought she was going to die, including her husband and her mother, who raised $7,000 for her treatment a state away in her Pennsylvania town. Well, almost everyone. Someone who saw Mindy on the newspaper cover had doubts, and voiced them in a call to the police. 'It’s a lie,' said the tipster. 'You should check it out.' And when police did just that, they discovered it really was a lie. Taylor had raised at least $20,000 from towns in two different states while keeping everyone except her 7-year-old little girl in a state of fear she could die anytime. Taylor was arrested and charged with felony theft. Considerate: Only Taylor's 7-year-old daughter was spared the terrible news that her mother was dying . But Ross County Prosecutor Matt Schmidt believes the scheme was more for the attention than for the money and some of Taylor's illnesses may have, in fact, been real. The Columbus Dispatch reports that the former Chillicothe schools employee left her job in 2012 and has been collecting social security ever since. And the Chillicothe Gazette reports that she may have a history of heart trouble. Taylor has now applied for what's called a diversion, which will clear her of the felony charge if she pays back the $20,000-plus sum she bilked from concerned loved ones. Taylor's attorney Jeff Benson said she's already returned much of the cash. He also said he believes Taylor's real physical illness will make itself known soon, whether or not it's the terminal cancer she once claimed to have. 'There’s been a significant change in her physical appearance,' he told the Dispatch. 'There’s something going on.' 'It's a lie': A February 24 local newspaper cover featuring Taylor became her undoing. A reader called a tip into Chillicothe police, who investigated and found that Taylor never had cancer at all .","Mindy Taylor, 35, of Chillicothe, Ohio convinced her friends, neighbors, college buddies, co-workers and even her husband that she had cancer .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A senator unintentionally demonstrated his point about train safety when he almost got struck by a locomotive during a speech. Richard Blumenthal, who is a Democrat from Connecticut, had been talking at Milford Metro-North station when a train whistled past at a high speed. Complete with easels and charts, Blake was laying out the MTA's safety violations, which total 139 over the last 10 years, worth $552,000 in fines. Scroll down for video... Lesson one: Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal received an unexpected lesson in practicing what you preach at a press conference as a train whizzed by . To begin: All is quiet and calm as Senator Richard Blumenthal and the Mayor of Milford, Connecticut stand on the platform, but an express train is just moments away . The force of the Amtrak train was so much it caused him to stumble and a chart he was holding nearly fell over. Ironically, the train had almost hit him at the exact moment Milford mayor Ben Blake had said: ‘Safety, as you know, is paramount.’ Senator Blumenthal had been campaigning for greater accountability from Metro-North railway after it was revealed it had paid $552,000 in fines in the last decade. The politician’s close call with the train happened on Friday. Blumenthal had no comment about the close call. Lookout behind you! Just as the senator is giving his speech, an express train roars into view. A concerned cameraman points at the Senator to watch out . In the blink of an eye: In an instant, the train is whizzing by. As the fast-moving train glides toward the presentation, Mr Blake ironically utters: 'Safety, as you know, is paramount.' Data provided by the Federal Railroad Administration shows the Metro-North has five times the number of safety defects as any commuter railroad in the country. It saw two major train derailments in 2013, one in New York City killed four passengers, a system-wide outage that left thousands of passengers stranded in the dead of winter, and several fatal accidents on the tracks. A spokeswoman for the Metro-North said earlier this month that the commuter railroad generally does better in federal inspection that most railroads. Still going: As the train approaches break-neck speed, the presentation and easel are almost knocked over! Maybe we should move? The duo decide to stand further back from the edge of the platform as the presentation continues .","Senator Richard Blumenthal had a close call with a train Friday while giving a speech on commuter safety .

"By . Alex Greig . A San Diego man accused of shooting his ex-wife dead and then trying to commit suicide by inhaling the fumes of a gas generator claims the smoking cessation drug Chantix played a role in the killing. Defense attorneys for Tim Danielson, 65, say he was suffering depression when he shot his former wife Ming Qi, 48, in the Lakeside home they shared. They say the depression was caused by Chantix, which Danielson began taking weeks before Qi's death. Chantix defense: Timothy Danielson is expected to give evidence about how Chantix affected his mental state during his trial . The Chantix website warns that the drug's possible side effects include 'hostility, agitation, depressed mood, suicidal thoughts or actions.' According to ABC 10, the judge hearing Danielson's case allowed expert testimony about what role the drug may have played in Danielson's state of mind at the time of the shooting. UT San Diego reported that Danielson, a former high school champion distance runner who worked as an engineer, and Qi, a Chinese national and university professor whom he met online, married in 2006 and divorced in 2008. Shot by former husband: Ming Qi was shot six times by Danielson, who then attempted to gas himself to death . At the time of her death, Ming Qi had moved into her former husband's home due to financial difficulties. The pair shared the home but had separate bedrooms. Sometime between 9pm and midnight on Sunday June 13, 2011, the pair fought. The prosecutor in the case said the pair argued after Danielson discovered Qi was dating another man. Danielson was 'trying to kick her out of the home; she was dating someone else,' the prosecutor said, reported UT San Diego. Danielson . retrieved a .22 caliber rifle and shot Qi 'as she was attempting to run . away. When she was down on the ground, he put the rifle to her head and . pulled the trigger,' according to District Attorney Mike McCann. Ming . Qi was shot six times. Danielson then carried her body upstairs to his bedroom and turned on a generator to kill himself by carbon monoxide poisoning. He . sent an email to his sister-in-law telling her what he had done . sometime after midnight. She notified police and they discovered . Danielson and the body of Ming Qi in the early hours of Monday morning. Danielson was reportedly near death. He is expected to take the stand and tell jurors about how Chantix affected his mind. Criminal defense attorney Jan Ronis told ABC 10 that mental defenses are  'not very popular, but it sounds to me like it's the only defense there is.' 'Previously, it was called diminished capacity, now it's called diminished actuality,' explained Ronis. 'It's a murky area of law that still provides somewhat of a defense, and as I mentioned this may be an only defense if this is not a whodunit.' Warning: Chantix now carries the FDA's strongest safety warning because of its possible side effects, including suicidal thoughts and aggression . The New York Times reports that at a court hearing five months after the shooting, Danielson's lawyer Paul Pfingst suggested that Danielson was confused that June day in 2011, he 'didnâ€™t know what was going on' and thought 'something was seriously wrong with his brain' and wondered if he actually killed Qi or whether it was 'all a dream.' Tim Danielson pleaded not guilty and has been awaiting trial without bail since 2011. More than 2,700 lawsuits, now consolidated, have been filed against Pfizer, the manufacturer of Chantix, alleging that the drug caused suicidal thoughts, aggressive and erratic behavior, depression and loss of memory in patients. In recent months, Pfizer has settled two high-profile test cases, but has maintained that the drug is safe to use. As of July 1, 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires Chantix to carry a black box warning, the agency's strongest safety warning, due to public reports of side-effects including depression, suicidal thoughts, and suicidal actions. Jury selection in Danielson's trial begins Wednesday.","Tim Danielson, 65, shot his ex-wife Ming Qi dead in 2011 then tried to gas himself to death .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The number of pets being put down in animal shelters across the U.S. has declined dramatically in the past four decades. According to the Humane Society of the United States, the number of dogs and cats being euthanized today is about one-fifth of what it was in the 1970s. That's even as the number of pets in the country is booming from 64 million to 160 million over the same time period. Tiny orphans: Chihuahuas make up about a third of the dogs at many California animal shelters . 'They were euthanizing about 15 million pets back in 1970,' Betsy McFarland, vice president of companion animals at the Humane Society of the United States told Fox News. 'We’re now down to about three million every year. Of course, that’s three million too many. But that is tremendous progress that’s been made over the last four decades.' Broad grassroots spay and neuter campaigns have also helped to reduce the number of unwanted pets. McFarland says a major part of the reduction is societal attitudes towards pets. 'I mean pets are really considered part of the family,' McFarland told Fox News. 'And that has been a shift over the many decades where maybe pets were a little more utilitarian.' Another factor is better coordination among animal welfare organizations to try and keep animals out of shelters. Still too high: About 50 per cent of the animals that enter shelters are euthanized . Changing attitudes: People now think of animals as a part of their family, rather than something more utilitarian, says McFarland . Although the number of pets entering shelters has fallen, 50 per cent that do enter are euthanized. Fox News reports that in the Atlanta area, a non-profit organization called LifeLine Animal Project is seeking to help both pet owners and animal shelters. 'What we found was that so many of the calls from the people who wanted to surrender their pets, they didn’t actually want to surrender their pets,' Debbie Setzer, LifeLine’s community outreach director, told Fox News. 'They may have had some financial hardship where they couldn’t afford dog food. They may have had a fence complaint where the dog was getting out.' LifeLine will help pet owners in any way they can to keep the animal out of the shelter, from providing donated pet food to mending fences. The organization has also helped shelters to reduce their euthanasia rates by organizing pet drives in shopping malls and other high-traffic areas.","The number of dog and cats being euthanized has dropped dramatically in the past 40 years .

"By . Amanda Williams . Witold Sobkow said the Polish were opting to stay and make the most  of Poland's blossoming economy, rather than to move to Britain . Polish people want to stay in their home country rather than move to the UK because there are 'more opportunities' for them at home, according to the country’s ambassador. Witold Sobkow said that more and more men and women were opting to stay and make the most of Poland’s blossoming economy, rather than to move to Britain. Mr Sobkow, Poland's ambassador to the UK, said the 'huge wave' of migration from his home land was now over. He told the Independent: 'There are more opportunities in Poland, we have had huge economic success, wages are higher in Poland now and there are more jobs in many parts of Poland, so I think this is over.' He added: 'Of course people would like to stay in Poland and not live abroad. 'They love the UK but if you are at home there is no place like home.' He was speaking ahead of the ten year anniversary of Poland joining the European Union. According to official figures, 29,000 Poles came to Britain in 2012, compared with 88,000 in 2007. Earlier this month officials admitted that hundreds of thousands of Eastern European immigrants came into Britain uncounted because inspectors were at the wrong airports. The report revealed that 350,000 people arrived unnoticed because of glaring gaps in the survey relied on by the Office for National Statistics for migration estimates. Those counting migrants into the country went to Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester during the crucial years of large-scale immigration from Eastern Europe, while only a handful attended other major airports such as Luton and Stansted, where hundreds of thousands of migrants were arriving. In addition, immigrants on many ferry routes were barely or never checked, tens of thousands of children were missed entirely and warning signs from other statistics were ignored, the report adds. Mr Sobkow, Poland's ambassador to the UK, said the 'huge wave' of migration from his home land was now over . The ONS confession comes almost 12 months after the discrepancies first emerged – and follows years of scepticism over the accuracy of its International Passenger Survey, which is based on interviews with people passing through air and sea ports. The ONS said that most of the unchecked immigrants arrived in the four years after Poland and seven other Eastern European countries entered the EU in April 2004, when Britain was one of just three European countries to allow them in to take jobs.","Witold Sobkow said many were staying for .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . A Milwaukee man accused of 'sexting' a 14-year-old Texas girl just weeks after his wife died in a car crash will stand trial. Michael Gawlitta, 42, faces three charges of 'causing a child between the ages of 13 and 18 years of age to view or listen to sexual activity,' reports Fox. Gawlitta lost his wife Tammy Gawlitta in a crash during a snowstorm in December of 2013 on 1-43 at Highway 100. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Accused of sexting 14-year-old girl, Michael Gawlitta, 42, will stand trial . Following the crash, Micheal's community rallied to raise money for his family after the tragic death of his wife Tammy . At the time, Gawlitta's community attempted to support he and his four children, but weeks later detectives say that Gawlitta began inappropriate communication with a young girl. The 14-year-old girl's mother Ginger seized a cell-phone from her daughter after she learned her daughter had been speaking to a man named Michael with a Milwaukee number for over three hours. When the mother discovered a video of Michael engaging in a sexual act and whispering her daughter's name she brought the videos to police. 'I never want to see a man from the waist down, completely exposed, calling out my daughter’s name. My first reaction was I was disheartened. I was crying. You know, I was upset. I just felt weak in the knees. I couldn’t sleep the whole night,' the girl’s mother told FOX6 News on Tuesday, April 8th. Police spoke with the girl who says she first started talking to Gawlitta on her phone's messenger application. Tammy Gawlitta died just weeks before her husband's inappropriate communication with a teen girl began . Tammy Gawlita suffered a fatal car crash in December 2103 just weeks before the alleged interaction began . She decided to talk to Gawlitta because his name was 'Mister Baseball' on the application and she likes baseball.

"By . James  Nye . With its distinctive 45-degree diagonal crown the Citigroup Center is one of Manhattan's most prominent skyscrapers. But nearly 40 years ago, as a hurricane threatened the Eastern Seaboard, New York's Office of Emergency Management was hurriedly planning a mass evacuation of Midtown in case the tower collapsed - decimating 18 blocks of Midtown like dominoes all the way to Central Park. Thankfully, that plan was never put into action, and the story of how just one phone call from an architecture undergraduate set off the chain of events that saved New York City from certain disaster went untold for almost 20-years. Scroll Down for Video . Iconic: The stilts of the Citigroup (then Citicorp) Center are visible in this 1978 picture along with directions for St. Peter's Church (left) When it was topped-out in 1977, the 59-story, $195 million skyscraper on Lexington Avenue was the seventh-tallest building in the world. In fact, the most distinctive part of its construction are its four massive, 114-foot-tall stilts that are located in the center of the building, rather than its corners. 1977's New York- The new Citicorp Center, which occupies 74,180 square feet of a city block officially opened on 10/12. It is 915 feet high, which made it the seventh tallest building in the world at the time . They exist because the skyscraper had to be built around the remodeled St. Peter's Church which originally existed on the corner of 53rd Street. But these stilts caused a potentially catastrophic structural design flaw which went unnoticed from drawing board to completion. Had the weakness not been discovered and fixed under cover of night, the Citigroup Center could have come down during any of the major storms which hit New York City in summertime. While the architect of the building was Hugh Stubbins, the real genius behind its unusual design belongs to its chief engineer, William LeMessurier. Designing the building around the church called for the stilts so as to allow the building to start more than one hundred feet above the ground. Because the stilts were not on the corner of the building, where they would obviously traditionally be, LeMessurier came up with a brilliant chevron structure - literally eight rows of steel V's running vertically through the building, acting as its skeleton. Indeed, LeMessurier was aware that this chevron structure would make the building very light for a skyscraper, meaning it would sway in strong winds. To account for that, one of the first ever tuned mass dampers - a 400-ton concrete ball at the top of the building - that would compensate like a stabilizing force for the movement in wind, was added. Chevron: The ingenious chevron design is seen here in one of the offices in the Citigroup Center shortly after it opened in 1977 . However, one year after the building had opened, full of office workers and tens of thousands of oblivious New York commuters below, LeMessurier got a phone call. An undergraduate named Diane Hartley phoned him to ask for his considerable expertise on the design, which had begun to confuse her. She explained that her professor had expressed his own doubts about the 25,000 ton skyscraper because the stilts were not on the corners. 'Listen, I want you to tell your teacher that he doesn't know what the hell he's talking about,' LeMessurier told Hartley according to DamnInteresting.com 'because he doesn't know the problem that had to be solved.' The esteemed engineer, then 51, explained to Hartley that the tuned mass damper was in perfect alignment with the stilts and chevrons, leaving it able to withstand huge winds, especially from a diagonal angle - the most powerful. After putting the phone down, LeMessurier decided to double check because he had been so forceful in his rebuttal of Hartley's questions according to 99 Percent Invisible.com . Cut across: Another of the huge chevrons (there are 8 in total) is seen to dart through the skyscraper like a skeleton . He became especially fixated on a minor engineering change that took place during the construction phase. Le Messurier discovered that the joints on the chevrons were bolts, not welds, because the actual builders of the skyscraper had not been aware that the Citigroup Center was vulnerable to diagonal or quartering winds. This set huge alarm bells off. Usually, all buildings are strongest at the corners and winds that face full on, or perpendicular winds are the most troublesome. However, because of the unique design of the Citigroup Center, LeMessurier discovered that Hartley and her professor had made a frighteningly correct observation. LeMessurier came to the terrifying . conclusion that without the damper, a storm powerful enough to bring . down the skyscraper hits New York every 16-years. But, that only works on the proviso that the high-tech tuned mass damper, which is powered by electricity, is operational. What if the storm caused a power-cut? Ethics: William LeMessurier was the chief engineer for the construction of the skyscraper and realized the enormous structural flaw in the building . So, in the spring of 1978, with hurricane season fast approaching, LeMessurier took his findings to his friend, Alan Davenport, who confirmed his worst fears. Devastated, LeMessurier retreated to Sebago Lake, in Maine to work out what to do. His reputation might be ruined, he would possibly face bankruptcy. Part of history: This is Diane Hartley - who is now a real estate consultant in Washington D.C. - who helped discover the massive flaw in the Citigroup Center . He contemplated suicide. However, he knew that if he didn't act, tens of thousands of people would, in all probability die. He rushed to meet with Citigroup executives and using a book, which they slammed shut, dramatically demonstrated to the bank's executive vice-president, John S. Reed, what would happen. Getting to work in secret in June of 1978, Citigroup, the NYPD and the Office of Emergency Management began work on repairs and an evacuation plan that spanned a 10 block radius. The public had no idea the danger they faced and a fortuitous newspaper strike helped authorities keep a lid on the crisis. More than 2,500 Red Cross volunteers were on standby along with three different weather services constantly watching the weather. Welders worked through the night, after staff had left the building. But then in August, with repairs only half-way completed Hurricane Ella formed off Bermuda and seemed on a collision course with Manhattan. The evacuation plan to empty most of the eastern side of Midtown Manhattan was readied. Luckily .

"By . Belinda Robinson . Mice infestation: The terrified star took to Twitter to tell fans that she 'shrieked with fear' after spotting the rodent . Elizabeth Hurley says she 'shrieked with fear' when she encountered an infestation of mice at her plush mansion. The terrified star took to Twitter to tell fans that she came face-to-face with a mouse in her living room in Donnington Hall, Herefordshire. Ms Hurley, 48, was spending Easter at home with friends and family, but quickly took to the social media site to express her plans to launch 'operation vermin' after seeing the mouse. She tweeted: My mum on her way round with her two killer cats. I'm having a stiff drink.' She added: 'Operation vermin started early this morning. On my hands and knees looking for evidence.' The next day she tweeted: 'Thank you for all your rodent killing advice...taking it all on board. Have declared war on them.' The star, has two homes in the UK - a mansion in Herefordshire and a stylish flat in West London. Her mansion was reported to have cost £6million when she bought it two years ago with ex-boyfriend Australian, Shane Warne, 44. It's estimated that along with common house mice, there are over 10million super rats throughout Britain, in a growing problem that is cropping up in areas from London to Liverpool.

Donnington Hall: Liz Hurley's £6 million Georgian mansion on the edge of the Forest of Dean is set in 187 acres and boasts 13 bedrooms - but Liz admits there is a mice problem . Pest control experts have warned that . the super rats are likely to become more common in the UK as more . households get careless about how they throw out their rubbish, and . discard left-over fast food. They also warn that the rodents are becoming increasingly resistant to poison. Experts say the conventional blood-thinning poison used to kill the rats is not working as it used to. Now . pest controllers are calling on the government to tighten up its . response to the monster-size vermin and asking the EU to approve . stronger ‘third generation poison’ to kill them. Merseyside . pest controller Sean Whelan from Whelan Services told Mail Online: . ‘We’re seeing an upsurge in rat call-outs, it’s gone up significantly by . about 15 per cent over the past year. ‘It’s . been very good for us. But I’m not entirely sure what’s causing it, it . could be the weather, it’s been very cold and it’s been very wet. ‘They’re twice as large as they once were. It’s definitely not uncommon to see rats the size of a cat. ‘The problem is that they’re feeding more than they used to. They’re feeding off leftover junk food that we throw away. ‘If . there is vermin, 99.9 per cent of the time it’s our fault. We’re . basically feeding them and they get used to it. So they keep coming . around us to get more food,' he added. A new map has revealed the hotspots where the rats are located, showing how widespread the problem is in affluent parts of the country. Rat danger spots: This map shows the towns and cities where the super rats are across the UK . Pest expert Dr Colin Prescott, from Reading University, also confirms that the rats are increasingly resistant to the poison being used on them. He also says that the resistance was thought to be confined to rats living in Berkshire, but it is much more widespread, as rats all over the country show increasing immunity. Today, the 'monster rats' are . in every town throughout the country and there has been an increase in . sightings in Liverpool, Birmingham and London. During the 1960s onwards, rat poison . was based on the blood-thinning agent warfarin. It worked by draining . the blood from the rat and killing it. At present, pest controllers use bromadiolone, but both are proving to be ineffective on some monster vermin. ‘We . find that the rats are becoming resistant to poison,' Mr whelan said. 'We used to use Warafin when I first started out 23 years ago. It was . the first generation of rat poisoning and used to work but doesn't do . much now. 'We need new, stronger poisons as they've grown used to what we use.' However, rat poisons are controversial, due to secondary poisoning and risks to children, pets and wildlife. Rodents . are difficult to kill with poisons because their feeding habits reflect . their place as scavengers. Rats will eat a small bit of something and . wait, and if they don't get sick, they continue. An effective rodenticide must be tasteless and odorless in lethal concentrations, and have a delayed effect. There have been two generations of poisons given to rats. The first generation include: warfarin and coumatetralyl. The second generation are: difenacoum, brodifacoum, flocoumafen and bromadiolone. But rats are growing increasingly resistant to both. Ridiculous rodent: This photo shows a huge rat that was caught in Cornwall earlier this year. It measured 50cm from tail to nose. Both Mr Whelan and Dr Prescott are calling on the EU to approve stronger rat poison. But wildlife campaigners have also raised concerns that it could wreak havoc on animal and birds. However, rat sightings are growing, and one image taken last week in . Cornwall, shows a giant rat being held up by its tail -  and the man . holding it is 6ft 1in, giving a sense of its horrifying scale. Pest control experts warn that there will be even more monster rats . found if they are allowed to feast on food near junk food shops, . restaurants and household bin areas outside blocks of flats.","Elizabeth Hurley, 48, took to Twitter to reveal her mansion was infested with mice .

Mr Eaton lost 8st in a year and now weighs 12st. He lost the weight by adopting the Caveman Diet . He told MailOnline: ‘My diet was very poor – a lot of fast food and takeaways and lots of drinking. ‘It was a massive change swapping diets and it took lots of determination. ‘Now I look back at what I was eating and I think it was terrible.’ Mr Eaton, from Sheffield, piled on the pounds in his late 20s.

Snacks - Nuts, seeds and vegetables . For supper he would have pie and chips and he would then go to the pub where he would have a buffet and up to 14 pints of beer. Sometimes, he says he would even get himself a kebab on the way home from the pub. During the day he would also snack on biscuits and cakes and he drank six to seven cans of Coca Cola a day. He said: ‘I was feeling sluggish and tired. I got chest pains and really bad acid reflux. ‘It’s scary to think what could have happened if I had continued like that.’ Eventually, Mr Eaton realised he had to change his ways as he was struggling with his job as a plumber because he could no longer fit into tight spaces. As a result, when he was invited to a free trial at Prime Mover gym in Sheffield, he jumped at the opportunity. He enjoyed the trial and also attended a nutrition support workshop where he learned about the Caveman Diet. He now does a lot of circuit training, running and interval training. He also plays squash and badminton and goes swimming regularly. Mr Eaton (pictured with a fellow gym-goer being rewarded for his weight loss efforts) says he now has far more energy and that he no longer feels bloated and sluggish .

He said: ‘I’ve bumped into quite a few people who have had to look twice because I look so different. ‘Doing this has inspired a lot of other people to change and it has definitely been worth it. ‘The . health benefits have been the best thing but I also feel much more . confident now and I can wear what I want rather than what fits.’ He added: ‘Through my personal training I want to inspire more and more people if I can.’ Mr Eaton says he can now see that his diet used to be terrible and that he was putting his health in danger .

"By . Ryan Gorman . One half of an infamous pair of identity thieves dubbed ‘Bonnie and Clyde’ has found herself back behind bars. Jocelyn Kirsch, 28, has been detained at a federal prison in Philadelphia after violating her probation by shoplifting two years ago in California and failing to pay restitution for her previous crimes. The brunette and then-boyfriend Edward Anderton rose to infamy in 2007 after being convicted of stealing almost $120,000 from friends and neighbors to spend on vacations, clothing, jewelry and other luxuries including $2,000 hair extensions. Thieves: Jocelyn Kirsch (left) and Edward Anderton (right) both spent time behind bars for identity theft - Kirsch is now looking at more prison time for shoplifting . Kirsch, living in California since being released from prison in 2011, was busted in 2012 for shoplifting clothes from Banana Republic, BCBG, J. Crew and Nordstrom’s stores in a Walnut Creek Mall, according to the Philadelphia Daily News. She was observed by a Nordstrom employee carrying multiple items of clothing and an expensive Tory Burch handbag before going into a dressing room and emerging without any of the clothes, according to a 2012 report filed by the U.S. Probation Office cited by the paper. The employee said she then placed the designer clutch on a chair and left the store before returning and taking it without paying, according to the report. She copped to stealing both the purse and a dress she damaged by removing a sensor when returned to the store by a staff member. Jet set: Kirsch is shown with boarding passes from the multiple trips taken by the couple paid for with stolen money and credit cards . Bonnie and Clyde: The pair's yearlong romance was dominated by extravagance at the expense of others . Questioning by police led her to further admit stealing about $318 worth of clothing from Banana Republic that she had in a shopping bag she was holding. The store declined to prosecute because the thefts were not witnessed by a store employee, the report said. Further investigation led police to find further stolen items in her car. ‘Kirsch admitted to stealing some of the merchandise and claimed it was stolen several weeks earlier,’ said the report. Neither J. Crew, nor BCBG pressed charges either. But Nordstrom’s did. The terms of her parole forbid her from committing any more crimes. Kirsch’s conviction landed another year in jail and in violation of that parole. She also failed to make any of the court-ordered $250 monthly restitution payments to the victims of a scam that saw her and Anderton opening credit cards, writing checks and even just stealing cash from others. They spent the money on lavish vacations to the Caribbean, Hawaii, Europe and even Morocco, according to The Guardian. The high life: Kirsch and Anderton gave off the impression they were wealthy, but it was all a lie . Tropical oasis: This Caribbean vacation was paid for with someone else's credit card . Anderton and Kirsch dined in the best restaurants and attended the most exclusive parties. They flaunted their excess on Facebook and in Philadelphia’s society pages – their conspicuous lifestyle led to their downfall. ‘Jocelyn and Ed made performance art out of their extravagance,’ said the Guardian in a scathing account of the couple’s scam. They were busted after writing phony checks to a Philadelphia salon for those costly hair extensions. A little digging by the stylist led her to a postal box rented at UPS Store on the campus of Drexel University, where Kirsch was a student. She helped police set up a sting operation claiming the girl had left a textbook at the salon, the pair refused to meet the woman but made the mistake of threatening her to back off, police told the Guardian. ‘You don't know my name but I know yours. I also know ur nice place on wolf st and how u get home at night (sic),’ read a text message sent to the stylist by the thieves. ‘Youre (sic) the one who should be worried... you seem like a smart girl, walk away now or you will regret it.’ It's all gone: The pair are now separated and live on opposite sides of the country . No longer free: Kirsch can't see any rainbows from her prison cell . They were arrested retrieving a package of lingerie delivered to the post box but addressed to their across-the-hall neighbor. Police soon burst into their luxurious downtown apartment to find an extensive identity theft operation. Evidence recovered included a professional ID maker, computer spyware and lock-picking tools, police told the Guardian. The scheme was so elaborate that removing Anderton’s computer from the apartment caused the entire building’s internet access to go down, authorities said. Kirsch told a packed courtroom during her 2008 sentencing that her ‘regret runs bone deep and she will never repeat this mistake again,’ according to KYW. That was just another con for what appears to be a career criminal. She was sentenced to five years in prison, Anderton received four. Both were released early on good behavior - Kirsch only three years and five months into her sentence in November 2011. A Monday court hearing will determine how long her latest transgressions will land her in the slammer.","Jocelyn Kirsch was caught shoplifting in 2012 in violation of her probation .
